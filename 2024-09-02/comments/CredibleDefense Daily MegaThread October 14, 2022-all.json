This of course contradicts earlier reports that he was under criminal investigation. I will say, this is probably a better way of handling his loud complaints of the war's progress than locking him up. If Putin's lucky, Ukraine will either martyr him or otherwise silence his critiques. I'd rate this as plausible, but needs hard confirmation.\n\nThere is of course, a side impact to this. Girkin is likely to be given a life sentence next month over the downing of MH17 by the Netherlands. If so, his capture will not only be high on Ukraine's priority list, but also NATO's. And this very much an escalation on Russia's part. Few men besides Putin were as responsible for the 2014 outbreak of civil war than Girkin. If true, this continues the worrying trend that Putin is all in on this war, despite setbacks.",

Senator Klishas commented on the distribution of summons at subway stations in the capital: \"Each such signal should be checked and, if confirmed, the actions of officials who authorized such roundups should be given a legal assessment.\" He also explained why this practice is illegal. At the same time, the Moscow Military Registration and enlistment Office in a comment to RIA Novosti denies the delivery of subpoenas for \"partial\" mobilization near metro stations. The administration of St. Petersburg confirmed to RBC that military registration and enlistment offices and police officers began to appear in the entrances of houses in the city.

The administration of St. Petersburg confirmed to RBC that military registration and enlistment offices and police officers began to appear in the entrances of houses in the city. According to officials, these are &quot;alert groups.&quot; And State Duma deputy and ex-governor of the Ulyanovsk region Sergei Morozov proposed to shoot officers who send the mobilized to the front line without training. Spokesman for the President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Peskov commented on the roundups on people during the mobilization: &quot;Do not be afraid to walk around Moscow, you need to ask the Prosecutor General&#39;s Office.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://notes.citeam.org/mobilization-oct-13-14\">Volunteer summary on mobilization in the Russian Federation for October 13-14</a></p>\n</div>",

Their previous offensives have been widely successful and put it at a much stronger position to negotiate, but I can't help but feel like we've come to a point where all the low hanging fruits have been picked already. \n\nSteam rolling over Kharkiv or even Lyman was possible in part due to they're lower value for Putin. He certainly wanted to keep them as bargaining chips, but probably wasn't banging his fists on the table when his generals told him a retreat was necessary. \n\nWith remaining areas, it's probably a different story. We've already seen Putin double down on Kherson, even if that's a horrible decision military speaking. It'll probably be just as hard in the land bridge and Donbas. \n\nIt doesn't mean Ukraine won't be able to retake the remaining occupied territories, but I do believe it'll be much more costly to do so. \n\nIf Ukraine was to negotiate right now, it would certainly have to concede almost everything currently held by the Russians in order to get a deal, with the notable exception being the right margin of the Dnieper. \n\nNeedless to say, that's not a deal Ukraine will take as long as they believe they can get anything better through fighting. Right now there's a lot of appetite to fight, so even small gains can justify the cost. \n\nThis is basically where my view becomes contrarian to most here (and probably where I piss many people off), as I believe there's a small but real chance that Russian tactics like conscription actually do work to get a frozen conflict, at least for a while. This is made even more possible by the fact that the West is running out of stuff it can easily donate without compromising it's stockpiles, meaning both equipment and ammo might start to be transferred as fast as it can be produced, which might slow down ukrainian offensives.",

Each submunition contains seven spring deployed trip wires, when tripped this will launch the main charge one to two meters into the air and detonate it. A *bouncing betty*-type. Both include fuzing options for 4 or 48 hours till self-destruct. I don't believe either system has ever been used.

I would imagine that a military level service plan would have an even higher baseline, so it's $3500 or less of a premium.  \n\nSo that's $42 million per month, or $504 million per year.  And what you get is the most advanced mobile internet service in the world, 24/7 support, and defense against the full brunt of Russian cyberattacks and EW across the entire theater.  That just isn't really very much in terms of how much wars cost. A Tomahawk costs $2 million, so firing 1 Tomahawk per day is more expensive than Starlink for all of Ukraine.  If this were a sale to the US government through the standard contracting process, I would bet the price would be 10x, and I bet they would pay it.\n\nAs for what it costs, lets compare to the private market for cybersecurity.  For a 40 person company this article estimates that cybersecurity costs $168-600 per month.  https://www.business.com/articles/smb-budget-for-cybersecurity/  If Ukraine has 200K soldiers at the front that scales up to $120 million per month at the high end.  And the high end here is for a company, not a military that is facing 24/7 direct attack by the entire cyber-warfare capabilities of the Russian military.  $42 million per month is a bargain.",

It&#39;s as if people have amnesia from earlier in the war when the losses were so great the only answer was &quot;they will be accounted after the war&quot;. (Dignified answer).</p>\n</div>",

The US has gone after Chinese companies and research institutes for supporting Russia\u2019s military.</p>\n\n<p>Russia has sought to skirt the Western restrictions on critical technology through vast networks of wealthy oligarchs and front companies, the new analysis says, targeting Europe and North America in particular in an effort to procure the required components.</p>\n\n<p>The effort to prevent the sanctions evasion has led to a \u201ccontinuing cat-and-mouse game to detect and take action against these channels.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Russia could have been flying missiles down the same corridor for multiple strikes, and Ukraine positioned SAMs in the path.</p>\n\n<p>SAM systems are a form of area denial, and Ukraine doesn&#39;t have enough of them to provide wide spread coverage apart from whatever S-300 systems Ukraine still has operational. Even then it&#39;s not like any system is 100% effective.</p>\n</div>",

According to these observers, such an elite split could at the very least have helped put an end to the hostilities and could have eventually brought down the Russian regime. However, nothing of the sort has happened. Moreover, despite the recent deterioration of the situation on the frontline and the withdrawal of Russian troops from eastern and southern Ukraine, there is no reason to expect a split among the Russian elites in the foreseeable future.  \n>  \n>**Not all autocracies are the same**  \n>  \n>The term \u2018a split within ruling elites\u2019 became popular among political scientists after 1986, when Guillermo O\u2019Donnell and Philip Schmitter\u2019s book \u2018Transitions from Authoritarian Rule\u2018 was released. Drawing on the collective experience of collapsing autocracies in Southern Europe and Latin America, the book describes a situation where mass protests cause an ideological split within ruling elites into hard-liners \u2014 those ready to drown the protesters in blood \u2014 and soft-liners. The latter are willing to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the conflict with the opposition. According to O\u2019Donnell and Schmitter, the ideal scenario in such a situation is a pact between soft-liners and a moderate opposition on a transition to democracy.  \n>  \n>The fact is that in authoritarian regimes a split within elites into two or more relatively stable competing factions is possible only when these regimes are governed through collective leadership. Collective leadership is not typical of post-Soviet authoritarian regimes, including the Russian one. Although some analysts have coined catchphrases such as \u2018Politburo 2.0\u2032, the nature of Putin\u2019s interactions with his entourage bears little resemblance to the leadership of the Central Committee under Khrushchev or Gorbachev. There are no mechanisms for collective decision-making at the level of the country\u2019s leadership today, and meetings with top officials look more like a demonstration of their approval of decisions made unilaterally by the head of state (recall, for example, the meeting of the Russian Security Council on the eve of the launch of the \u2018special military operation\u2019 in February 2022). Rather, such mechanisms of governing the country resemble a kind of a solar system where individual planets rotate in different orbits, more or less distant from a single celestial body. No split is possible within such a governance system: an individual planet may divert from its orbit, but collective action by the planets against the celestial body is hardly possible.  \n>  \n>**Barriers to collective action**  \n>  \n>A split implies that different segments of the elites are cooperating with one another. In the Russian case, however, no regular cooperation, let alone cooperation based on common political views, is possible. The representatives of the ruling elite are co-opted personally by the head of state on an individual basis. Of course, they may have a common interest in the struggle for some influential positions, for the reallocation of financial resources, or on some other issues. However, such alliances and coalitions are organised on an ad hoc basis and represent not organised factions but rather short-lived cliques whose interests sometimes coincide and sometimes contradict each other.  \n>  \n>What could shake the current equilibrium and encourage the Russian elites to act collectively? Unlike Latin American military dictatorships, where trade unions were the main driving force behind mass protests, in today\u2019s Russia opposition was trampled on long before 24 February.

Even if we put the cutoff as \"post-1943\" and limit it to \"Well organised internal overthorw attempts\" ...\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_assassination_attempts_on_Adolf_Hitler\n>March 13, 1943 - Flight to Smolensk - Henning von Tresckow, Fabian von Schlabrendorff \n\n>On the return flight from a front visit, Hitler visited the headquarters of the Army Group Center in Smolensk. During the visit there were several attempts on his life:\n\n>* Under the direction of Major Georg von Boeselager, several officers were to intercept and assassinate Hitler in a grove on his way from the airport to the headquarters. Hitler was guarded by an armed SS escort; the plan was then dropped.\n>* During lunchtime, Tresckow, Boeselager, and others planned to get up at a sign and fire pistols at Hitler. The commander-in-chief of the Army Group, Field Marshal G\u00fcnther von Kluge, knew about the plan but decided not to intervene. However, the plan was abandoned when it became clear that Hitler would not be present. Kluge forbade the attack, citing his fear of a possible civil war erupting between the SS and the army.\n>* In a last-ditch attempt, Fabian von Schlabrendorff gave a time bomb camouflaged as a package of two liqueur bottles to an officer in Hitler's entourage, as a supposed gift to a friend in Germany. The bomb was supposed to explode on the return flight over Poland. The package was placed in the hold of the aircraft, where it iced up, causing the detonator to fail. Realizing the failure, Schlabrendorff immediately flew to Germany and recovered the package before it was discovered.\n\n>March 21, 1943 - Berlin - Rudolf Christoph Freiherr von Gersdorff\t\n>After becoming close friends with leading Army Group Center conspirator Colonel (later Major-General) Henning von Tresckow, Generalmajor Gersdorff agreed to join the conspiracy to kill Hitler in order to save Germany. After Tresckow's elaborate plan to assassinate Hitler on 13 March 1943 failed, Gersdorff declared himself ready to participate in an assassination attempt that would entail his own death.\n\n>On 21 March 1943, Hitler visited the Zeughaus Berlin, the old armory on Unter den Linden, to inspect captured Soviet weapons. A group of top Nazi and leading military officials \u2013 among them Hermann G\u00f6ring, Heinrich Himmler, Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, and Grand Admiral Karl D\u00f6nitz \u2013 were present as well. As an expert, Gersdorff was to guide Hitler on a tour of the exhibition. Moments after Hitler entered the museum, Gersdorff set off two ten-minute delayed fuses on explosive devices hidden in his coat pockets. His plan was to throw himself around Hitler in a death embrace. A detailed plan for a coup d'\u00e9tat had been worked out and was ready to go but, contrary to expectations, Hitler raced through the museum in less than ten minutes. After Hitler had left the building, Gersdorff was able to defuse the devices in a public bathroom \u201cat the last second.\u201d After the attempt, he was transferred back to the Eastern Front, where he managed to evade suspicion.[15]\n\n>November 16, 1943 - Wolf's Lair - Axel Freiherr von dem Bussche-Streithorst\t\n\n>Encouraged by Claus Stauffenberg, Major Axel von dem Bussche agreed to carry out a suicide bombing in order to kill Hitler. Bussche, who was over two meters tall, blonde and blue-eyed, exemplified the Nazi \"Nordic ideal\" and was thus chosen to personally model the Army's new winter uniform in front of Hitler. In his backpack, Bussche concealed a landmine, which he planned to detonate while embracing Hitler. However, the viewing was canceled after the rail car containing the new uniforms was destroyed in an Allied air raid on Berlin.\n\n>January 1944 - Wolf's Lair - Ewald-Heinrich von Kleist-Schmenzin\t\n>Ewald von Kleist attempted a scheme similar to Von dem Bussche's. However, the uniform inspection was once again postponed, and eventually cancelled by Hitler.\n\n>March 11, 1944 - Berghof - Eberhard von Breitenbuch\t\n\n>On 9 March 1944, covert German resistance member Busch and his aides were summoned to brief Hitler at the Berghof in Bavaria on 11 March. In discussion with Tresckow, Breitenbuch declined to make a suicide bomb attempt attack. Instead he would try to shoot Hitler in the head with a 7.65mm Browning pistol concealed in his trouser pocket.[16] Busch and Breitenbuch travelled on a Condor aircraft to Bavaria, and were allowed into the Berghof. But SS guards had been ordered \u2013 earlier that day \u2013 not to permit aides into the conference room with Hitler, preventing Breitenbuch's attempt.[17]\n\n>July 20, 1944 - Wolf's Lair - Claus von Stauffenberg\t\n\n>On 20 July 1944, Claus von Stauffenberg and other conspirators attempted to assassinate Adolf Hitler, F\u00fchrer of Nazi Germany, inside his Wolf's Lair field headquarters near Rastenburg, East Prussia, now K\u0119trzyn, in present-day Poland. The name \"Operation Valkyrie\"\u2014originally referring to part of the conspiracy\u2014has become associated with the entire event.[1][2]\n\n>The apparent aim of the assassination attempt was to wrest political control of Germany and its armed forces from the Nazi Party (including the SS) and to make peace with the Western Allies as soon as possible. The details of the conspirators' peace initiatives remain unknown,[3][4][5] but they would have included unrealistic demands for the confirmation of Germany's extensive annexations of European territory.[6][7]\n\n>The plot was the culmination of efforts by several groups in the German resistance to overthrow the Nazi German government. The failure of the assassination attempt and the intended military coup d'\u00e9tat, or putsch,[8][9] that was to follow led the Gestapo to arrest more than 7,000 people, 4,980 of whom were executed.[10]\n\nIf there were as many organised internal attempts to off Putin as Hitler, I'd not bet on Putin surviving.\n\nHitler had one of those \"runs of good luck\" for a long time. With bombs failing to detonate, him just missing/cancelling events where attempts were being made, getting through events faster than the timers set on placed suicide bombs, and even surviving a large briefcase bomb placed yards away from him because it was placed on the \"other\" side of a sturdy table leg.\n\nIf the Moscow elites tried as much to off Putin as the German elites tried to off Hitler , it's unlikely he'd have quite the same run of luck.",

                            "body": "> Vietnam\n\nYour commentary is clear historical revisionism. Your decision to arbitrarily no longer apply the concept of political will in a conversation about conquering two continents is completely absurd and you completely ignore the gargantuan bombing campaigns into North Vietnam which were still unable to suppress the insurgencies and achieve American political objectives. In any case, if foreign support is really such a significant obstacle to achieving American military objectives then maybe taking on all of the Americas, a quarter of africa and half of Europe might not be a great idea?\n\n> See invasion of Iraq and gulf war for a good idea of how conventional warfare would go, which is the topic in this conversation.\n\nThe general topic of this conversation is conquest and the US has utterly failed in that regard within the last 20 years. Do you want to talk about how the US couldn't even prop up local proxies even while they were still present? Do you want to talk about the significant contributions of US allies to both combat operations and logistical support? Do you want to talk about the months of preparation which were necessary to create the ground conditions suitable to such rapid advances? I have no idea how you expect similar advances through the Darien Gap, the Amazon or the Andes either when the terrain is completely unsuited for Tanks.\n\nAnd that's before you even start considering that any invasion of Europe begins with a full naval Assault across the Atlantic against militaries with significantly more modern equipment than Iraq even if they for some reason act without their European partners.\n\n> Could US take Europe and could they hold Europe are different.\n\nNo, you are restating the question because you now understand that the original position I was arguing against is completely indefensible. It's not enough to just nebulously define \"_take_\" and try to duck out of the exchange without actually considering the implications that at some point a country of 300 million has to occupy over a billion people simultaneously.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOh, and also: **all of the above has to happen within a single year.** It's a nonsensical fantasy of American exceptionalists who refuse to take the lessons that a full two decades of failed counter insurgency operations have failed to teach them: war is an extension of politics and the will of so many people will be greater than the armouries of the US.\n\n___\n\n> I said a bit here, but there's no napoleanic unity after the war. You have several major wars, such as the Franco Prussian war, or the French intervention in Spain, or the wars of German unification. They aren't small. Europe in post napoleon times had the congress, but no sense of alliance or unity. This is also the era of massive wars of imperial expansion abroad.\n\nHave you actually read what you wrote? Europe was split in two by the iron curtain after the 2nd world war, quite literally in the case of Germany. Wars you casually gloss over like the Algerian war had as many casualties as the Franco-Prussian war you highlight and decolonial wars in general had huge scope and impact. The unity you describe is a fantasy beyond a unity compelled by the cold war - it has only really been with the founding of the European union **48 years after American dominance began and after the cold war had ended** that a European identity and sense of cohesion independent of a specific ideology actually began to develop, to a large extent specifically because the US was sometimes an unreliable partner as in the Suez crisis.\n\n> US dominates Europe in cultural reach (see English usage), technology, military, etc. this is true in demographics as well. See post 2008 recovery in Europe or even the ongoing Covid recovery. US gdp per capita dwarfs that of the EU.

                            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>Vietnam</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Your commentary is clear historical revisionism. Your decision to arbitrarily no longer apply the concept of political will in a conversation about conquering two continents is completely absurd and you completely ignore the gargantuan bombing campaigns into North Vietnam which were still unable to suppress the insurgencies and achieve American political objectives. In any case, if foreign support is really such a significant obstacle to achieving American military objectives then maybe taking on all of the Americas, a quarter of africa and half of Europe might not be a great idea?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>See invasion of Iraq and gulf war for a good idea of how conventional warfare would go, which is the topic in this conversation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The general topic of this conversation is conquest and the US has utterly failed in that regard within the last 20 years. Do you want to talk about how the US couldn&#39;t even prop up local proxies even while they were still present? Do you want to talk about the significant contributions of US allies to both combat operations and logistical support? Do you want to talk about the months of preparation which were necessary to create the ground conditions suitable to such rapid advances? I have no idea how you expect similar advances through the Darien Gap, the Amazon or the Andes either when the terrain is completely unsuited for Tanks.</p>\n\n<p>And that&#39;s before you even start considering that any invasion of Europe begins with a full naval Assault across the Atlantic against militaries with significantly more modern equipment than Iraq even if they for some reason act without their European partners.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Could US take Europe and could they hold Europe are different.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>No, you are restating the question because you now understand that the original position I was arguing against is completely indefensible. It&#39;s not enough to just nebulously define &quot;<em>take</em>&quot; and try to duck out of the exchange without actually considering the implications that at some point a country of 300 million has to occupy over a billion people simultaneously.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and also: <strong>all of the above has to happen within a single year.</strong> It&#39;s a nonsensical fantasy of American exceptionalists who refuse to take the lessons that a full two decades of failed counter insurgency operations have failed to teach them: war is an extension of politics and the will of so many people will be greater than the armouries of the US.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I said a bit here, but there&#39;s no napoleanic unity after the war. You have several major wars, such as the Franco Prussian war, or the French intervention in Spain, or the wars of German unification. They aren&#39;t small. Europe in post napoleon times had the congress, but no sense of alliance or unity. This is also the era of massive wars of imperial expansion abroad.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Have you actually read what you wrote? Europe was split in two by the iron curtain after the 2nd world war, quite literally in the case of Germany. Wars you casually gloss over like the Algerian war had as many casualties as the Franco-Prussian war you highlight and decolonial wars in general had huge scope and impact. The unity you describe is a fantasy beyond a unity compelled by the cold war - it has only really been with the founding of the European union <strong>48 years after American dominance began and after the cold war had ended</strong> that a European identity and sense of cohesion independent of a specific ideology actually began to develop, to a large extent specifically because the US was sometimes an unreliable partner as in the Suez crisis.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>US dominates Europe in cultural reach (see English usage), technology, military, etc. this is true in demographics as well. See post 2008 recovery in Europe or even the ongoing Covid recovery. US gdp per capita dwarfs that of the EU. The gap is widening, not decreasing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is completely nonresponsive to anything that I wrote before as I never even commented on any of the claims you&#39;ve made here. There&#39;s no reason to include it beyond patching up a shoddy argument with a comfort blanket of American exceptionalism regardless of the completely inappropriate context.</p>\n</div>",

By Monday, 500 ground terminals showed up in Ukraine. By Wednesday of that week, all but 25 of those terminals were alive and providing real-time data.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Musk being a tool is no reason not to properly compensate SpaceX for future services, especially if it impacts their business. People seem to think that the satellites are in orbit already and that SpaceX suffers no losses by providing aid to Ukraine.</p>\n</div>",

(They would not, and there are no others, free or otherwise).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>&quot;Did they not do a cost analysis on what Musk&#39;s &quot;charity&quot; was going to cost&quot;</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To my knowledge, SpaceX hasn&#39;t tried to recoup <em>any</em> past expenditures, they only said that things would need to change at some point in the future. Also afaik Starlink has been free at point of use across Ukraine since day one. Various aid funds have reimbursed SpaceX for some of those costs at various times, but apparently not all.</p>\n</div>",

That, plus the energy crunch (especially with OPEC reducing supply), might lead to a real crisis moment like we saw in 2008-early 2010s. America might also be injured from that; lower demand due to rapid stagflation in the EU would very likely recess the American economy.\n\nWith less money to go around, it is likely any military expansion in Europe will be offset and delayed for the indefinite future, at least until their economies stabilize. America will still likely continue existing expenditures, being able to absorb shocks better than Europe, but might still be forced to cut back in some areas.\n\nThe party most injured by this new economic crisis, would be Ukraine. Beyond their military needs--which are ever expanding and desperately needed, their economy is in shambles and needs urgent Western support to prop up. While I don't think NATO will stop supporting Ukraine in arms and moral support, I do think there's a risk that financial aid will be cut. With that, we will see hyperinflation for the civilian economy in Ukraine, and perhaps risks of unpaid soldiers, unaffordable food, and the beginnings of state collapse if not remedied.\n\nThis was always the gamble Putin wanted to make. He's been aided, perhaps unsurprisingly, by greedy OPEC princes and a poor mimcry of Thatcher in the UK. To put it plainly: Europe needs energy to keep their economies humming. Ukraine needs money and arms, which are at risk if the EU economy collapses.\n\nThe next six months will be crucial. If Ukraine can hold the line, if America can backfill the EU's energy needs and punish OPEC effectively, if the UK can get its house in order, then Putin's gambit will have failed.

If it was actually a profit margin thing surely they could have transitioned quietly to some kind of cost+ deal. Basically Starlink has the Willy Wonka golden ticket to transition to a sustainable buisness model. </p>\n\n<p>Which tells me this isn\u2019t really about money, the public nature of this fight suggest Musk is arm twist his way into getting something else. Maybe it\u2019s cash starlink doesn\u2019t need, or a way to exit from Ukraine, or revenge for his stupid poll getting blown up. But it\u2019s not about Starlink as a business, but starlink as an extension of Musks ego.</p>\n</div>",

The Army has been trying to shut down their production since 2013. Congress has responded to lobbying by their manufacturer, General Dynamics, and kept the production lines open. \n\nThere's little argument in the US Army about availability.

Those tanks are no longer a threat. \n\nThe logistical hurdle of providing the Abrams to Ukraine is real, but nothing the US Army couldn't have solved by now. \n\nWhat I suspect drives the US's persistent reluctance is the consequences of Russia capturing an Abrams. The Abrams can do things no other tank in the world can do. The US Army wants to keep it that way for as long as possible.  \n\nPersonally, I think the time has come to put that argument aside. This war has ended the threat of Russia's tanks for a couple of decades to come. It's difficult to see any scenario in a conflict with China in which tanks come to bear or are even relevant. \n\nIf not now, when?",

Anti-Russian sentiment is largely bipartisan. 3) Musk is consistently wrong and unpleasant, he does not speak for wider business figures. 4) This can be treated as an experiment on what does and doesn&#39;t work in repelling an imperial power cf: Taiwan. 5) It seems Germany and France recognise they actually can&#39;t roll over and benefit anymore. 6) Ukraine won&#39;t simply stop fighting, they will make do with what they can for a while yet. With that in mind what is better for the West - to keep helping or to let an atrocity expand an embolden Russia further?</p>\n</div>",
