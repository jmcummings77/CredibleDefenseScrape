        "body": "An article about the USV armed with anti-air missiles by H I Sutton.  With drones having played a significant part of the Ukrainian defense, Taiwan, the Philippines and any other nations with coasts & waters at risk to Chinese incursions will be interested in the USV developments. Being able to deter both sea and air assets with a fleet of relatively cheap USVs will be well worth the investment if the technology continues to mature from the current conflict.\n\n[Ukraine Has World\u2019s First Navy Drone Armed With Anti-Aircraft Missiles | Naval News | May 2024](https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2024/05/ukraine-has-worlds-first-navy-drone-armed-with-anti-aircraft-missiles/)\n\n*Ukraine's uncrewed surface vessels (USVs) are dominating naval combat in the Black Sea. Yet they have, until now, been particularly vulnerable to aircraft. So Russian defenses have emphasized using helicopters and fighter jets to stop them. Now a version armed with two repurposed air-air missiles could change the tide again.*\n\n*The war in Ukraine has removed any remaining doubts that drones are transforming warfare. In the naval arena, Ukraine\u2019s maritime drones are leading the world in terms of combat application. These explosive-laden craft first challenged, and then changed, many preconceptions. Now Ukraine has deployed an entirely new category of maritime drone, one armed with air defense missiles.*\n\n*Until now Ukraine\u2019s maritime drones (USVs) have been most vulnerable to aircraft. They are essentially defenseless against a helicopter armed with a machinegun. Now, with some USVs armed with potent air-defense missiles, Russian pilots may think twice about approaching them.*\n\n*In practice this is the first such air-defense USV in the world. Other country\u2019s manufacturers have explored giving USVs some form of air defense. But this system is the first fielded operationally, and indeed, the first in combat.*\n\n*The new USV (uncrewed surface vessel) is distinct from previously observed types, featuring a new wider hull. This allows two missiles to be carried side-by-side.*\n\n*It is armed with two R-73 air-air missiles.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>An article about the USV armed with anti-air missiles by H I Sutton.  With drones having played a significant part of the Ukrainian defense, Taiwan, the Philippines and any other nations with coasts &amp; waters at risk to Chinese incursions will be interested in the USV developments. Being able to deter both sea and air assets with a fleet of relatively cheap USVs will be well worth the investment if the technology continues to mature from the current conflict.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2024/05/ukraine-has-worlds-first-navy-drone-armed-with-anti-aircraft-missiles/\">Ukraine Has World\u2019s First Navy Drone Armed With Anti-Aircraft Missiles | Naval News | May 2024</a></p>\n\n<p><em>Ukraine&#39;s uncrewed surface vessels (USVs) are dominating naval combat in the Black Sea. Yet they have, until now, been particularly vulnerable to aircraft. So Russian defenses have emphasized using helicopters and fighter jets to stop them. Now a version armed with two repurposed air-air missiles could change the tide again.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The war in Ukraine has removed any remaining doubts that drones are transforming warfare. In the naval arena, Ukraine\u2019s maritime drones are leading the world in terms of combat application. These explosive-laden craft first challenged, and then changed, many preconceptions. Now Ukraine has deployed an entirely new category of maritime drone, one armed with air defense missiles.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Until now Ukraine\u2019s maritime drones (USVs) have been most vulnerable to aircraft. They are essentially defenseless against a helicopter armed with a machinegun. Now, with some USVs armed with potent air-defense missiles, Russian pilots may think twice about approaching them.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>In practice this is the first such air-defense USV in the world. Other country\u2019s manufacturers have explored giving USVs some form of air defense. But this system is the first fielded operationally, and indeed, the first in combat.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The new USV (uncrewed surface vessel) is distinct from previously observed types, featuring a new wider hull. This allows two missiles to be carried side-by-side.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>It is armed with two R-73 air-air missiles. This parallels a trend on land with Ukraine increasingly leveraging missiles designed for one system on another.

Which then means you have to again increase your military capabilities to feel secure again. Which makes your rivals increase their military capabilities again.\n\n(obviously IR theory fails to fully describe the real world, but IMO it can (very occasionally) provide some useful thought paradigms.  Not trying to argue the overall merit of IR theory.)\n\nMoreover, there is no set ratio of \"$1 buys 1 unit of defense.\" \n\n- You never know if the capabilities you are buying are going to be useful or cost effective as new technology evolves.  This can lead to the optimal approach being to overspend -- buying a wide variety of capabilities to be best situated for an unknown future.\n\n- You don't know if the capabilities you are buying are going to be the right capabilities for the fight you are going to have.  A extremely bad example, but just to make a point: Ukraine would not be in a significantly better position if they had purchased an addition $5B of bombers in 2014.  They would be in a significantly better position if they had spend $5B on additional fortifications, drones, EW systems, etc.\n\n- A big part of defense planning is trying to understand your aims, and then building the right capabilities to achieve those aims. Most countries don't feel the need for significant force projection, so they don't build aircraft carriers.  Building an aircraft carrier can't be judged as a \"good\" or \"bad\" investment until you know your aims.  The more narrow your aims, the more efficient you can be to achieve them.\n\n\nBut, full stop, defense planning is not a fully rational exercise.

But then they send that info up to the next level of the Army, who is responsible for deciding not just how many Patriot missiles need to be purchased, but also how many Abrams, helicopters, Artillery tubes, etc. etc.  So now the numbers coming out of that process are no longer fully driven by a bottoms-up requirements analysis; they are the result of trade-offs between different systems.  Maybe these tradeoffs are purely rational --  Even fully rational people will come to different conclusions from the same inputs (mission requirements, intel, etc.) -- so there will have to be compromise, because we can't buy everything to protect against every possible risk.  Or maybe the guy in charge use to be a Tanker so he is partial to Abrams, so he says that more Abrams should be purchased, and less Patriots, and we get a less than rational output. They send this compromised request list to Congress. \n\nNow you get another level of inputs -- some rational, some parochial, some just dumb.  And eventually to get to final funding amounts, and the Army can go buy X Patriots.\n\nThere is a MASSIVE level of analysis going on at DoD to drive investment decisions. There are people whose whole job it is to understand how many Patriot missiles are needed to provide an \"acceptable\" level of coverage to meet mission requirements. But their analysis is going to be based on a ton of assumptions (some which will prove accurate, others which will prove faulty), and then their analysis will be altered by all sorts of other forces.\n\nBut this is all at the micro level.  I don't think there is any way to calculate macro things like \"X dollars will deter Russia from aggression.\"  Deterring is much more about emotions/internal politics/cultural considerations, etc.  It is very hard to model.  We can model \"we probably need X tanks, Y ATGMs, and Z PGMs to stop Russian tank columns rolling into Poland.\"  But we can't model if us having X Y and Z means Russia will attack Poland or not.\n\nAnd keep in mind that military investment decisions are made over decades, not years.

But then they send that info up to the next level of the Army, who is responsible for deciding not just how many Patriot missiles need to be purchased, but also how many Abrams, helicopters, Artillery tubes, etc. etc.  So now the numbers coming out of that process are no longer fully driven by a bottoms-up requirements analysis; they are the result of trade-offs between different systems.  Maybe these tradeoffs are purely rational --  Even fully rational people will come to different conclusions from the same inputs (mission requirements, intel, etc.) -- so there will have to be compromise, because we can&#39;t buy everything to protect against every possible risk.  Or maybe the guy in charge use to be a Tanker so he is partial to Abrams, so he says that more Abrams should be purchased, and less Patriots, and we get a less than rational output. They send this compromised request list to Congress. </p>\n\n<p>Now you get another level of inputs -- some rational, some parochial, some just dumb.  And eventually to get to final funding amounts, and the Army can go buy X Patriots.</p>\n\n<p>There is a MASSIVE level of analysis going on at DoD to drive investment decisions. There are people whose whole job it is to understand how many Patriot missiles are needed to provide an &quot;acceptable&quot; level of coverage to meet mission requirements. But their analysis is going to be based on a ton of assumptions (some which will prove accurate, others which will prove faulty), and then their analysis will be altered by all sorts of other forces.</p>\n\n<p>But this is all at the micro level.  I don&#39;t think there is any way to calculate macro things like &quot;X dollars will deter Russia from aggression.&quot;  Deterring is much more about emotions/internal politics/cultural considerations, etc.  It is very hard to model.  We can model &quot;we probably need X tanks, Y ATGMs, and Z PGMs to stop Russian tank columns rolling into Poland.&quot;  But we can&#39;t model if us having X Y and Z means Russia will attack Poland or not.</p>\n\n<p>And keep in mind that military investment decisions are made over decades, not years.  So your capabilities are always going to be mismatched with reality, because reality moves much faster.</p>\n</div>",

                "body": "> The failure to consider the possibility that the war could drag on for years was a pretty colossal blunder during the first year and a half or so of the war.\n\nIt was even dumber than that. Under any conceivable scenario for the future course of the war, whether long or short, Ukraine would (and will) need to maintain a credible deterrent against renewed Russian aggression for many years to come. The danger of Russian nationalist revanchism will remain for a long time, even under unreasonably positive potential conditions, such as Russia voluntarily disarming after an unconditional surrender following decisive Ukrainian battlefield victory, never mind if Putin's efforts to militarize society succeed. And that scenario is already absurdly optimistic, so we can be fairly certain (and could be just as certain back in 2022) that the Ukrainians will need to maintain a far more substantial air force than they could possibly achieve without western aircraft to replace their aging Soviet-legacy fleet.\n\nWestern aircraft almost necessarily means at least some F-16s given the sheer scale of numbers available relative to any other reasonable relatively low-cost multi-role option. That basically just means Gripen, which, while a good alternative to F-16s, may struggle to compete in terms of part availability, compatibility with various pods and weapons systems, and similar scale issues given that an order of magnitude fewer have been produced than F-16s, and may not have been available early enough because Sweden felt the need to delay until their NATO membership application was accepted. In any case, these issues were understood at the time, and it was clear F-16s were the first choice for Ukraine anyway, so political debates, logistical considerations, or strategic complexities around what specific aircraft to provide did not force any delay. \n\nWith the transition to F-16s clearly inevitable, there was and is no reason to delay, except lack of political will. Worst case scenario, the Ukrainians would have perhaps ended up slightly stronger than strictly optimal during a ceasefire or negotiated peace, when the extra firepower doesn't matter as much, meaning there was a somewhat suboptimal allocation of limited aid funds. Yet it's difficult to imagine any scenario where the Ukrainians would have *too much* air power, nor a situation where delaying the expense of transitioning to a new fleet of multiroles would benefit anyone at all, nor a scenario where they would not be able to make efficient use of F-16s. Even during peace they will need to maintain regular CAPs, if only to guard against the almost inevitable renewal of Russia's long history of airspace violations designed to test potentially hostile nations' responses and to normalize grey zone provocations.\n\nSo the suboptimal allocation would have been vanishingly small at worst, whereas the opposite strategy of not providing timely aid potentially opens up Ukraine to devastating harm. In fact the recent delays in US aid have done exactly that, and left Ukraine vulnerable to Russia's grinding offensives. The failure to provide F-16s in a timely fashion similarly has extended the period of Ukraine's vulnerability to Russian long range strike campaigns, because F-16s will almost certainly help compensate for the desperate surface-to-air missile supply crunch that the Ukrainians are experiencing as they attempt to fend off the endless waves of Russian cruise and ballistic missiles and Shahed-style long-range strike drones that are crippling the civilian economy.\n\nBottom line, we didn't need to know this was going to be a long war to know Ukraine was going to need long-term western support to establish robust logistics pipelines sufficient for equipping, training, and sustaining a military force capable of credibly deterring Russian aggression for many years into the future. That strategic reality pretty much necessarily dictates creating logistical and training pipelines for long-term supply of F-16s to Ukraine at scale. And we knew this, all along.",
