People are complaining about how Ukraine is being shipped the M864 which is a base-bleed shell with a range of 30 km, versus the cheaper and more common M483A1 which has a range of 17 km (all presumably on the M109). \n\nWhen it comes to counter-battery fire, range is king. In order to engage in counter-battery, you need to have enough reach to hit wherever the enemy artillery is emplaced. If Russia truly is using more and more towed artillery, there's good chance they are being used at the extreme end of their range. The D-20 howitzer, for example, is only a L/34 and so with vanilla ammunition its range is only 17.5 km. If you want to counter-battery at D-20, the M483A1 won't have the reach in most situations, but the M864 has a 12.5 km advantage. In comparison the Msta-S has a L/47 calibre gun that gives it a base range of 25 km. There the Ukrainians would have to bring their SPGs uncomfortably close to the frontline to try and engage them, which is probably why we mostly see them being hit by GPS rockets.  GPS is pretty slow in terms of the action loop compared to using counter-battery radar, however.\n\nNeedless to say, the difference in effect on target for towed artillery versus SPGs for DPICM rounds is pretty significant. DPICM against men in trenches is already pretty nasty, but people standing around a gun in the open with no cover? I don't envy the poor Russians dying for Putin's war.",

Each one is a small shaped charge that can go through about 70 mm of steel, which is more roof armor than anything on the battlefield has.

They started taking delivery of the AWP munitions for GMLRS rockets in 2015, so any cluster versions of these rockets still in existence are not wanted/needed and can be given to Ukraine.\n\nFor the 155's there are older and newer version of the round. Its unclear which portion of the 100,000 are older and which newer. \n\nThe US started decommissioning the older versions (M483A1) in 2009. They were removing all the bomblets, disposing of them, filling the cases with concrete, and using them as training munitions instead (which was expensive but required as a safe way to dispose of them). Any of these still in stocks are also not wanted/needed and can all be given the Ukraine. It'll save the US money to do so.\n\nFinally there are the newer versions of the 155mm rounds (M864). These they *want to* decommission, but require a replacement round for from the AWP programme. I don't think any replacement here is near ready, so they won't want to part with ALL of these until it is.... but doubtless they can/will send at least some of these now... and may be able to send more later. Again, any sent will save the US money on decommissioning.\n\nI don't see any reason they couldn't give all 100,000 rounds to UA eventually.....and a majority of that 100,000 over the coming months (all the older ones, some of the newer ones).... but decisions about readiness/replacement timelines/required minimum stores are going to decide how far through that 100,000 they're willing to go.",

Wrong.** You are going by social media content, and as I have already shown, even in that you aren't doing a very good job of keeping track. The 5th Assault Brigade and the 24 Aidar battalion are directly at the flanks of the 3rd Assault brigade, and uh... guess what? They are doing a great job at... staying at the flanks of the advancing 3rd brigade? Do you understand what that means? It means they are advancing too, at the same rate.

For me, a unit that has been at the hottest part of the front for 6 months is obviously suffering casualties, but if they are able to still advance through it, especially at an area that received Russian re-inforcements, then it isn't that heavy. Since you obviously haven't been keeping track on them, even though you think you have, you don't know that they have been doing rotations of battalions doing the heavy lifting throughout these months.\n\nThey still have plenty of combat potential to finish the job at Kleeschavka.

This article by Oriana Skylar Mastro and David A Siegel discusses the forces and conditions which drive countries to the negotiating table, as well as those which may incentivize leaders to refuse negotiations. The authors introduce the concept of \"resiliency\", the capacity for a state to resist further escalation. States are concerned that the act of opening up negotiations will be perceived as further weakness, giving their opponent an incentive to double down or increase the intensity of their attacks  Conditions and actions which reduce the risk of escalation or increase resiliency should therefore increase the chance of states opening negotiations. One way this can occur is through signaling resiliency by the state currently refusing negotiations. The goal is to disincentivize escalation in response to a signal of weakness by showing that said state is capable of resisting further escalation, such as through a \"costly signal\". Another is the assessment by one party that the other finds further escalation to be too costly. An important note is that states see these costs as blows to their perception, independent of the actual state of the battlefield.  As a result, the authors find that \"face-saving measures\", like unilaterally reducing the intensity of a conflict, are less effective than might be hoped because they fail to address the perception of vulnerability that states see as the true cost of negotiation. This dynamic holds while states have high resiliency, where they can be confident that further escalation by their opponent will not result in their outright defeat. When states have low resilience(in other words, when they are lo longer able to prevent or resist the opponent's escalation), they may open negotiations at the first opportunity, choosing to accept the costs of being perceived as weak in order to avoid the greater costs of an outright defeat.\n\nThe implications for the conflict in Ukraine are clear. First and foremost, this article is a strong rebuttal to the idea put forth by [Haass and Kupchan](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/ukraine/russia-richard-haass-west-battlefield-negotiations) that the West can compel Ukraine to the negotiating table while continuing to provide sufficient aid to repel further Russian attempts at conquest. As long as Ukraine remains a \"high-resiliency\" state, capable of credibly defeating Russian escalation, they will be loathe to give an impression of weakness that could incentivize Russia to double down. Similarly, given that Russia's entire thesis of victory rests on the idea of the West eventually exhausting its will for escalation and ceasing its aid to Ukraine, Haass and Kupchan's decision to open negotiations with Russia signals that the West is reaching that point of \"low-resiliency\", where it is looking to cuts its losses with early negotiation. This in turn would be an incentive for Russia to further escalate, on the presumption that the West will be unable to prevent or impose costs for doing so. \n\nOriana Skylar Mastro is a fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies at Stanford University and a non-resident senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a think-tank.\n\nDavid A Siegel is in the Department of Political Science at Duke University\n\n>Getting belligerents to the negotiating table is complicated and fraught with difficulties, both in theory and practice. A willingness to talk is seen as the first concession, affecting an adversary\u2019s beliefs about the balance of power and resolve long before offers are exchanged. Assuming, as is often done, that talks occur during fighting inhibits our understanding of the process of war. This article contributes to our understanding of conflict and its negotiated conclusion by proposing a novel mechanism to explain why rational states may refuse to talk during war and when they might change their positions. We find that states are willing to open negotiations under two conditions: when their opponents find escalation too costly, and when there is a signal of high resilience that only the highly resilient care to use.\n\n>Those findings have important policy implications. Political scientists have long recognized the dilemma of compellence\u2014states may be reluctant to give in because of concerns that they are opening themselves up to even more coercion (Schelling, 1966). We show that states may be reluctant to show a willingness to talk for the same reason, and therefore, it can be counterproductive to attempt to coerce an enemy to the negotiating table. Todd Sechser (2010: 649) recommends that the stronger country issuing the compellent threat offer side payments or make lesser demands to assuage the reputational costs the target states may pay for acquiescing to deal with such challenges.\n\n>Our findings suggest a different explanation: states are concerned with the negative material consequences that their approach to diplomacy may convey to the enemy, and so face-saving measures emanating from the enemy do not allow a state to save face. After all, it would remain clear to the enemy that a decision to adopt an open stance signaled weakness, and that adverse inference would still yield the potential for escalation by the enemy. While the limitations of face-saving measures emanating from the adversary are discouraging, our findings suggest new opportunities for outside mediators, who can provide guarantees in ways that lessen the strategic costs of conversation.\n\n>An ever-increasing number of modern wars are limited conflicts that end in negotiated settlement (Pillar, 1983). Understanding how military outcomes translate into political outcomes\u2014how combat outcomes and diplomatic behavior interact to affect the likelihood that all sides will come to the table\u2014is of greater importance than ever before.

During the negotiations (generally known as the Oslo Process) that led to the Oslo Convention, a number of countries that use cluster munitions argued at first for the inclusion of a certain number of exceptions that would have allowed them to continue to possess and use highly reliable and accurate cluster munitions. During the ensuing negotiation process it was argued persuasively that the inhumane harm done by cluster munitions would not be abated absent a complete ban, and these countries changed their policies one by one.\n\n___\n\nThe issue is that even if cluster munitions have a low failure rate, they're fired in such high volumes that you can still produce a lot of unexploded ordinance which absolutely still has the potential to cause casualties long after the conflict is over:\n\n> Many of the countries that possess cluster munitions insisted during the Oslo Process that munitions equipped with self-destruction, self-neutralization, or self-deactivation devices (or capabilities) had extremely low failure rates in the past, and should be considered separately from older types of munitions which caused damage from unexploded ordnance. However, an important report was released at the Vienna Conference on Cluster Munitions (December 2007) that exploded the myth of highly reliable cluster munitions. It was a report of an analysis of the M85 with an SD mechanism, which was regarded as the most reliable of the cluster munitions.\n\n> For this second test, M85s in the inventory of the Norwegian military were used. These were manufactured under license from Germany. (The German nomenclature is DM1385, but this will be shortened to M85 in this paper.) A total of 192 DM662 155 mm artillery projectiles were fired, each containing 49 bomblets, for a total of 9,408 bomblets. The M85 bomblets were cluster munitions with a self-destruct mechanism developed by Israeli Military Industries (IMI). Mechanical impact fuses with pyrotechnic delay self-destruct mechanisms and self-neutralization devices were used. If the munition does not detonate on impact, the slide lock pin re-engages with the slide in a mid-way position, neutralizing the mechanism. It is designed to prevent accidental detonation by holding the explosive train out-of-line.24 The report mentioned above noted that the M85s used by the Israeli military in the summer of 2006 had a failure rate of approximately 10%. The M85 Firing Test (I) conducted in Norway yielded the results shown in Table 1. \n\n|||\n:--|:--\nBomblets fired | 9,408\nBomblets detonated | 9,304 (9,278 by impact initiation, 26 by self-destruction)\nDuds | 104 (of which 95 were unarmed)\nFailure rate | 1.11%\n\n> The 95 unarmed duds were tested in one of the following three ways (Test II): 1) placed in a cement mixer and spun for 30 minutes; 2) dropped from a height of 12 meters onto a steel floor; or 3) thrown into a bonfire. These tests were conducted to verify the functionality of the self-neutralization devices, so the three test methods were chosen to be similar to the ways in which a civilian population handles unexploded ordnance. \n\nSubject of Test | II M85 reaction | Proportion (%)\n:--|:--|:--\n1) | Detonated | 19.4\n2) | Detonated |2.4\n3) | Non-violent combustion |25.7\n3) | Deflagration | 65.2\n3) |Detonated | 9.1 \n\n> The following conclusions were drawn from these test results:\n\n> \u30fbLow impact initiation rate: Excluding instances of self-destruction, the M85\u2019s failure rate was 1.38%. In the past, the M85 failure rate was certified at 0.06%, well under the 1% reliability standard established by the stockpiling countries.\n\n> \u30fbLow self-destruction rate: of 104 pieces of unexploded ordnance, nine were armed. This demonstrates that the self-destruct mechanism failed to function. (These bomblets are designed to self-destruct if impact initiation fails when they are armed.) Because they are armed, there is a danger that they could detonate upon the slightest contact.\n\n> \u30fbLow self-neutralization rate: M85 duds are found in an unarmed state: 1) when they do not initially arm; or 2) if they successfully arm but their self-neutralization device functions because impact initiation fails. In Test II, detonations and deflagration were seen under both these circumstances, showing that the self-neutralization devices did not function correctly, and the munitions re-armed themselves. Although these M85 duds are referred to as \u201csafe\u201d unexploded ordnance, this test demonstrated the danger that they actually represent.\n\n___\n\nThe article also goes much further than that into a variety of areas concerning both cluster munitions and mines (such as why they're unreliable in the first place, the different standards countries have held themselves to and the attempts at forming international agreements at making them more reliable).",
