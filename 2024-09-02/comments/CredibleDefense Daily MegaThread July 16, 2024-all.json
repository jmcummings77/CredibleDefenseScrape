        "body": "So a few days ago there was a fake story going around on Twitter about Olena Zelenska buying a Bugatti. I saw it myself and even though it was being pumped up by the far right MAGA crowd I thought it was just regular disinformation. Well turns out its part of a much broader and deeper campaign. [The BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c72ver6172do)\n\n>A network of Russia-based websites masquerading as local American newspapers is pumping out fake stories as part of an AI-powered operation that is increasingly targeting the US election, a BBC investigation can reveal. \n\n>A former Florida police officer who relocated to Moscow is one of the key figures behind it.\n\n>The following would have been a bombshell report - if it were true.\n\n>But before the truth could even get its shoes on, the lie had gone viral. Influencers had already picked up the false story and spread it widely.\n\n>One X user, the pro-Russia, pro-Donald Trump activist Jackson Hinkle, posted a link seen by more than 6.5m people. Several other accounts spread the story to millions more X users \u2013 at least 12m in total, according to the site\u2019s metrics.\n\n>It was a fake story, on a fake news website, designed to spread widely online, with its origins in a Russia-based disinformation operation BBC Verify first revealed last year - at which point the operation appeared to be trying to undermine Ukraine\u2019s government.\n\n>Our latest investigation, carried out over more than six months and involving the examination of hundreds of articles across dozens of websites, found that **the operation has a new target - American voters.**\n\n>Dozens of bogus stories tracked by the BBC appear aimed at influencing US voters and sowing distrust ahead of November\u2019s election. Some have been roundly ignored but others have been shared by influencers and members of the US Congress.\n\n>The story of the Bugatti hit many of the top themes of the operation \u2013 Ukrainian corruption, US aid spending, and the inner workings of French high society.\n\n>Another fake which went viral earlier this year was more directly aimed at American politics.\n\n>It was published on a website called The Houston Post \u2013 one of dozens of sites with American-sounding names which are in reality run from Moscow - and alleged that the FBI illegally wiretapped Donald Trump\u2019s Florida resort.\n\n>It played neatly into Trump\u2019s allegations that the legal system is unfairly stacked against him, that there is a conspiracy to thwart his campaign, and that his opponents are using dirty tricks to undermine him. Mr Trump himself has accused the FBI of snooping on his conversations.\n\n>Experts say that the operation is just one part of a much larger ongoing effort, led from Moscow, to spread disinformation during the US election campaign.\n\n>Since state-backed disinformation campaigns and money-making \u201cfake news\u201d operations attracted attention during the 2016 US election campaign, disinformation merchants have had to get more creative both in spreading their content and making it seem credible.\n\n>The operation investigated by BBC Verify uses artificial intelligence to generate thousands of news articles, posted to dozens of sites with names meant to sound quintessentially American \u2013 Houston Post, Chicago Crier, Boston Times, DC Weekly and others. Some use the names of real newspapers that went out of business years or decades ago.\n\n>Most of the stories on these sites are not outright fakes.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>So a few days ago there was a fake story going around on Twitter about Olena Zelenska buying a Bugatti. I saw it myself and even though it was being pumped up by the far right MAGA crowd I thought it was just regular disinformation. Well turns out its part of a much broader and deeper campaign. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c72ver6172do\">The BBC</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>A network of Russia-based websites masquerading as local American newspapers is pumping out fake stories as part of an AI-powered operation that is increasingly targeting the US election, a BBC investigation can reveal. </p>\n\n<p>A former Florida police officer who relocated to Moscow is one of the key figures behind it.</p>\n\n<p>The following would have been a bombshell report - if it were true.</p>\n\n<p>But before the truth could even get its shoes on, the lie had gone viral. Influencers had already picked up the false story and spread it widely.</p>\n\n<p>One X user, the pro-Russia, pro-Donald Trump activist Jackson Hinkle, posted a link seen by more than 6.5m people. Several other accounts spread the story to millions more X users \u2013 at least 12m in total, according to the site\u2019s metrics.</p>\n\n<p>It was a fake story, on a fake news website, designed to spread widely online, with its origins in a Russia-based disinformation operation BBC Verify first revealed last year - at which point the operation appeared to be trying to undermine Ukraine\u2019s government.</p>\n\n<p>Our latest investigation, carried out over more than six months and involving the examination of hundreds of articles across dozens of websites, found that <strong>the operation has a new target - American voters.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Dozens of bogus stories tracked by the BBC appear aimed at influencing US voters and sowing distrust ahead of November\u2019s election. Some have been roundly ignored but others have been shared by influencers and members of the US Congress.</p>\n\n<p>The story of the Bugatti hit many of the top themes of the operation \u2013 Ukrainian corruption, US aid spending, and the inner workings of French high society.</p>\n\n<p>Another fake which went viral earlier this year was more directly aimed at American politics.</p>\n\n<p>It was published on a website called The Houston Post \u2013 one of dozens of sites with American-sounding names which are in reality run from Moscow - and alleged that the FBI illegally wiretapped Donald Trump\u2019s Florida resort.</p>\n\n<p>It played neatly into Trump\u2019s allegations that the legal system is unfairly stacked against him, that there is a conspiracy to thwart his campaign, and that his opponents are using dirty tricks to undermine him. Mr Trump himself has accused the FBI of snooping on his conversations.</p>\n\n<p>Experts say that the operation is just one part of a much larger ongoing effort, led from Moscow, to spread disinformation during the US election campaign.</p>\n\n<p>Since state-backed disinformation campaigns and money-making \u201cfake news\u201d operations attracted attention during the 2016 US election campaign, disinformation merchants have had to get more creative both in spreading their content and making it seem credible.</p>\n\n<p>The operation investigated by BBC Verify uses artificial intelligence to generate thousands of news articles, posted to dozens of sites with names meant to sound quintessentially American \u2013 Houston Post, Chicago Crier, Boston Times, DC Weekly and others. Some use the names of real newspapers that went out of business years or decades ago.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the stories on these sites are not outright fakes. Instead, they are based on real news stories from other sites apparently rewritten by artificial intelligence software.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In some instances, instructions to the AI engines were visible on the finished stories, such as: \u201cPlease rewrite this article taking a conservative stance\u201d.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The stories are attributed to hundreds of fake journalists with made-up names and in some cases, profile pictures taken from elsewhere on the internet.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, a photo of best-selling writer Judy Batalion was used on multiple stories on a website called DC Weekly, \u201cwritten\u201d by an online persona called \u201cJessica Devlin\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI was totally confused,\u201d Ms Batalion told the BBC. \u201cI still don&#39;t really understand what my photo was doing on this website.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The sheer number of stories - thousands each week - along with their repetition across different websites, indicates that the process of posting AI-generated content is automated.

My issue is with the government introducing legislation where it can legally define the truth and then penalize 'lies'. We know the Trump administration ran [COVID anti-vax botnets](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-covid-propaganda/) just a few years ago through the pentagon, do you trust these same people to declare the 'truth' and penalize 'lies' if they return to power in just a few months?\n\n>You would be considered engaging in misinformation if you post things without proof.

Blatant lies like pretending the children around the aid worker referenced died due to target being a suicide bomb was done by the government. In what we're discussing the government declares what is 'truth' and what is 'lies', legally the former becomes and lie and the latter becomes a truth.",

It&#39;s beyond ridiculous to think there&#39;s any defense for not targeting these propaganda networks. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have no issues with cracking down on botnets, and to my understanding that&#39;s something that is actively happening. My issue is with the government introducing legislation where it can legally define the truth and then penalize &#39;lies&#39;. We know the Trump administration ran <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-covid-propaganda/\">COVID anti-vax botnets</a> just a few years ago through the pentagon, do you trust these same people to declare the &#39;truth&#39; and penalize &#39;lies&#39; if they return to power in just a few months?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>You would be considered engaging in misinformation if you post things without proof. Iraq WMDs and Afghan withdrawal were stories uncovered by the press and NGOs. Not by botfarms. But I love this false equivalence where you think because the government gets shit wrong they have no right to protect its citizens against hostile nations looking to exploit our freedoms.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Indeed the truth came from the press and NGOs. Blatant lies like pretending the children around the aid worker referenced died due to target being a suicide bomb was done by the government. In what we&#39;re discussing the government declares what is &#39;truth&#39; and what is &#39;lies&#39;, legally the former becomes and lie and the latter becomes a truth.</p>\n</div>",

Biden didn't need to be a dove or concessionary on other issues, he just needed to lift tariffs. As it turns out, he didn't budge. \n\n- Then, Biden further surprised Beijing by becoming far more assertive than expected at boosting long-term domestic strategic competition, while directly barring Chinese entities from participating in these efforts. Biden's also made sure to increase scrutiny of US investments into China. These actions have far deeper implications for limiting Chinese technological and economic potentials than even Trump's trade war.\n\n- Diplomatically, China has probably also been annoyed that the Biden administration has been more actively trying to unite Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Australia, the Philippines, and even India into a more concrete anti-Beijing bloc. China's greatest fear is a replica of NATO in the Indo-Pacific, and while the Quad is still far from that, the momentum is far stronger under Biden than Trump.\n\nAnd so, considering the three points above, Beijing now sees Biden as an unexpectedly more competent and insidious opponent than Trump. Trump would say a lot of things and could inflict short-term pain, but there was a belief that he was ultimately transactional and that they could get him to pull back on some of his moves behind the scenes. \n\nBottom line: China doesn't like Trump, but they further dislike Biden's actions and what he represents - an actual mobilization of American state institutions to counter Chinese influence in the long-term - whereas Trump was seen as someone who would make big flashy moves but never unified the state to achieve meaningful impact.",
