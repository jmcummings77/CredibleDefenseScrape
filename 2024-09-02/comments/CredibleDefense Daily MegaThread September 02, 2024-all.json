The colonel's unfamiliarity with rotor-wing controls led to several instances where the accompanying chief warrant officer was forced to intervene. The crash occurred when the colonel, reverting to fixed-wing habits he was used to, mishandled the controls while attempting to hover and land, causing the helicopter to rotate and drop ten feet to the ground. Both the colonel and the warrant officer sustained injuries in the crash, with the colonel requiring surgical intervention for his injury.\n\nThe investigation went on to criticize the decision-making and management practices within the Utah National Guard, highlighting leadership failures as a major contributor to the crash. The report also pointed out the chief warrant officer's overconfidence and inadequate flight control management as other issues. This incident follows a pattern of leadership lapses within the UNG, evidence for this is a 2022 crash involving two UNG helicopters. As a result of this pattern, investigators recommended the National Guard Bureau reassess the use of orientation flight controls in Apache units to prevent unqualified personnel from being placed at the controls of these aircraft in the first place.\n\nThe report also mentions how different (obviously) flying advanced jets like the F-35 and combat helicopters like the AH-64D Apache can be. The F-35 uses advanced fly-by-wire and automation, allowing the pilot to reduce workload related to actual flight (at least in comparison to older aircraft) and instead, they can shift their focus towards mission management. The Apache requires constant manual inputs to maintain stability and perform low-altitude maneuvers. This inherent complexity makes them more challenging to operate in general, especially for pilots of fixed-wing, fly-by-wire, automated aircraft, in comparison.\n\nThis was a massive screw-up, ego seems to have played a part, but hopefully they can learn some valuable lessons.",

It is a coal mining town with a pre-war population of 14 thousand. The town is incredibly small in size since the population lived almost exclusively in large apartment buildings, so in essence it has around a dozen streets spread on barely more than a 5 square km area.\n\nNow i understand that towns and villages may have some geographical advantages to them alongside defences built up but still, isn't there a limit to how much fighting/soldiers a single town/village can soak in. And yet, although we don't know the exact numbers, it's safe to say Russia has lost disproportionate number of soldiers and equipment, as is probably the case on Ukrainian side (comparitavely speaking). Also, atleast looking on a map, a town is surounded by open fields, so it doesn't seem like it's some significant obstacle, but i might be wrong.\n\nOfficialy, the battle for Vuhledar has been going strong since October 2022 (with shelling begining months in advance). In the meantime much, much larger cities have fallen: Mariupol, Lysychansk, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and so on. Vuhledar is only now being described as at risk of being captured.\n\nSo, why has it been so difficult to overwhelm Vuhledar and other similarly small towns?",

But hey maybe the Europeans can offer to pay the Iranians off to not send the missiles, probably their single best chance</p>\n</div>",

If Russia feels that the agreement reached is not reflective of the balance of power on the ground, it can walk away and continue using force to achieve its policy goals. Now if there&#39;s a party with leverage on Russia, they can compel Russia to stay at the table or accept a slightly unfavorable deal. But Poland isn&#39;t that kind of party. And since everyone at the table understands this dynamic, there&#39;s a real genuine interest in crafting an agreement that is reasonably reflective of the facts on the ground.</p>\n</div>",

            "body": ">Will Russia ever run out of armor?\n\nWell, yes and no. Yes in the sense that their armor isn't unlimited and there's already a ton of evidence that shows they're burning through their stocks at an extremely unsustainable rate (they're not launching assaults with motorcycles, Desertcross vehicles, and increasingly without armored support for no reason). Most of Russia's equipment stockpiles that were in the best condition have already been pulled, meaning what's left is going to be more time consuming and expensive to refurbish, and is also likely of worse quality (think T-62s instead of T-90s). That being said, no Russia won't ever fully \"run out\" of armor as they are still producing it (though nowhere near replacement rates) and if or more likely *when* they get dangerously low on equipment they'll have to take even more extreme measures to conserve what they have. \n\n>What's interesting is their current tactics don't make it seem like this is actually a concern of theirs. \n\nI strongly disagree. What you note was truer in 2022 and 2023 than it is today. Back then the Russians were much more willing to launch huge armored assaults, wracking up enormous losses in the process, than they are now. In fact, they're extremely stingy with their vehicles these days, sending more and more infantry assaults with minimal to no armored support, launching attacks using motorcycles/desertcross vehicles, and using tanks in a longrange fire support role. Russian equipment losses are higher today than in 2022 or 2023 because a) Ukraine has more ammunition than it did back then, b) Ukraine has vastly more FPVs and munition dropping drones than they used to, and c) because of the scale of the fighting these days, which is the most intense it's been the entire war. Open source data struggles to convey this last point, but for the past 11 months the Russians have been launching relentless attacks across the entire front in Ukraine, and have suffered more personnel losses during this period than at any other 11 month period of the entire war, with disproportionately higher personnel losses than equipment losses during this period. \n\n>Additional question, if they do run low, are they able to source more armored vehicles from allies/third world/China?\n\nYes, but only to an extent. \"Allies\" such as North Korea and Iran don't exactly have the quantities of vehicles needed to make up for Russian losses, their equipment is outdated and likely largely not well maintained (what they're willing to part with is likely to be the oldest, worst equipment they have) and the Chinese have been studiously avoiding sending explicitly military equipment as they don't want to be hit with secondary sanctions. 3rd world countries have a similar problem to Iran and NK in that they largely have relatively small stockpiles of poorly maintained and outdated equipment. If China ever does go all in on Russia's behalf, however, their equipment concerns will be effectively resolved overnight.",

I considered it a mostly political move, meant to showcase capabilities to western supporters and get a bunch of POWs to exchange with russia. \n\nBut the operation took longer than reasonable if those were the reasons. Once you took your prisoners and showed your capabilities, why drag it on? The west already realized Ukraine is capable of defending against russian troops, not need to show anything. I thought \"well, maybe they want to hold onto those territories until russia has commited some troops there and weakened its Donbass offensive\", so they'll not only replenish their exchange fund, but also reduce the pressure on the Donbass front in the process. \n\nBut looking at russias response: It seems like they have pulled some troops from Ukraine, but not as much as Ukraine might have hoped and not enough to bring the russian offensive operations there to a halt. \n\nThen I realized Ukraine might also do this for political reasons - there is a lot of unsubstantiated talks about peace in the west and holding russian territory means russia is significantly less likely to pursue some kind of \"peace along the actual line of control\" because giving up russian territory comes with a political price that would be too high for russia. But I think they already achieved that and now it looks like they're preparing to take the regions south of the Seym in addition to the territory they already hold, commiting more ressources and manpower to the operation.\n\nAnd I can't make much sense of it. Sure, they might just take an opportunity that presents itself, but on the other hand they're investing ressources into an operation that, in my mind, will not yield that much for them while they also are hard pressed for those same ressources in the Donbass. It does not look like taking some more russian territory is the best possible use for those ressources to me. \n\nSo what do you make of the current developments on the Kursk front?

One that was very much open to boot even when Biden was still running, strikes me as almost ludicrous. Ukraine isn't defending against Donald Trump. Do you really think they've nothing better to do in Kyiv than following US election debates? Or each and any of Trump's daily pipe dream messaging (\"plan\") aiming for cheap political effects and directed at the local votership?\n\nIt doesn't even make sense as I don't see a single reason why a purported (and hardly conceivable) Trump/Putin collusion should be unable to also force a Ukrainian retreat from the legal Federation, when at the same time you're implying they could so easily get forced to \"concede\" everything else. Of course, if it ever came to that, the retreat would be a precondition. And then they might as well have to swallow it, what would the alternative be? Continuing in Kursk, as Trump stops all support? Hardly.\n\nAnd now that Harris is clearly in front, *if* you base your plans on daily weather and polling, they would better call it a day! Turns out for some reason they are not. I suppose other plans. And for what it's worth, if only for fairness' sake, I would like to remind Russia didn't start its invasion when Trump was in office. It started when (and seemingly as soon as) Biden was in office, and blundered in Kabul. There's more than a feeling that D. Trump is actually ws more disliked and feared in certain Western quarters than in Ukraine itself, or Russia-fearing Poland for that matter. Specifically, Zelensky's relation with him was never that bad. And why would it, they both like a good show and entertainment, both are originating from outside politics.

One that was very much open to boot even when Biden was still running, strikes me as almost ludicrous. Ukraine isn&#39;t defending against Donald Trump. Do you really think they&#39;ve nothing better to do in Kyiv than following US election debates? Or each and any of Trump&#39;s daily pipe dream messaging (&quot;plan&quot;) aiming for cheap political effects and directed at the local votership?</p>\n\n<p>It doesn&#39;t even make sense as I don&#39;t see a single reason why a purported (and hardly conceivable) Trump/Putin collusion should be unable to also force a Ukrainian retreat from the legal Federation, when at the same time you&#39;re implying they could so easily get forced to &quot;concede&quot; everything else. Of course, if it ever came to that, the retreat would be a precondition. And then they might as well have to swallow it, what would the alternative be? Continuing in Kursk, as Trump stops all support? Hardly.</p>\n\n<p>And now that Harris is clearly in front, <em>if</em> you base your plans on daily weather and polling, they would better call it a day! Turns out for some reason they are not. I suppose other plans. And for what it&#39;s worth, if only for fairness&#39; sake, I would like to remind Russia didn&#39;t start its invasion when Trump was in office. It started when (and seemingly as soon as) Biden was in office, and blundered in Kabul. There&#39;s more than a feeling that D. Trump is actually ws more disliked and feared in certain Western quarters than in Ukraine itself, or Russia-fearing Poland for that matter. Specifically, Zelensky&#39;s relation with him was never that bad. And why would it, they both like a good show and entertainment, both are originating from outside politics. Whereas this &quot;poison pill&quot; take is entirely Western fiction.</p>\n</div>",

Every square km they have to bomb is a square km of Ukraine saved.

But the fact that russia needs to divert, reorganize is already putting pressure. Again, not letting your enemy doing what they want is very important.

I am not sure how this will go forward, will they keep pushing or will they fortify as much as they can and pull out their mobile forces and brace the line with TDF and see how it goes from there while looking for another place to \"poke\" again the russian lines. Maybe a fake against russian territory again and then a \"\"real counter attack\"\" on Ukrainian land? I dont know whats their plan. I am just dont really understand how many are saying that this is a pointless/mistake offensive. I would say it achieved quite a lot for Ukraine. It could have been better, could have been worst, but if the defenses were weak and surprise could have been achieved, I think it worth the dic e roll.\n\nI still think that we have yet to see exactly how this will develop. I think UAF will take territory up to the Syem and maybe some other, but I dont expect much at this point. So an overcommital is in the cards for sure.

It is one of many tools that should be used to influence the actions of a state. In Russia's case, it has actually been quite successful, the effects just take a long time to be noticeable on a large scale. For instance, Russia is trying to build its first commercial airliner jet, but it keeps being delayed because Russia simply cannot build the parts it used to source from Europe and China doesn't make those parts, or at least not compatible ones. So in this case obviously sanctions haven't shut down Russia's commercial jet engineering companies, but they are going into debt trying to overcome issues that they didn't have before. That may seem like a small example, but when you add up a couple million dollars and a couple years delay here, and there, it adds up to billions and significantly setting back the economy for the next decade.",

If so, a withdrawal on a very large scale would be in order and that would be a profoundly risky, costly manouver. If so, to where? I understand that Ukraine has failed at the macro-level to prepare fortifications throughout much of the war, which begs the question of whether there\u2019s really any new defensive line for Ukrainian troops to fall back from if they have to make a large scale retreat in the Donbas. </p>\n\n<p>I don\u2019t anticipate that Russia has the coordination or air dominance for any rapid manouver operations, so I would expect their advance to continue on foot and with overwhelming artillery power, but nonetheless it appears that Ukraine is reaching a crisis point in the Donbas and I would appreciate hearing thoughts on whether a large scale withdrawal is necessary, whether it is feasible, and to where that withdrawal would take place.</p>\n</div>",
