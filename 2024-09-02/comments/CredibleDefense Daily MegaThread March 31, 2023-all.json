Unlikely as both sound I want to talk about that last option.\n\n\nRussian formations on that front are most likely of all fronts to be severely depleted by their attacks on Ukranian positions. Assuming Ukraine will use their newly trained reserves for this operation exhaustion is less likely to be a factor for them. Around Bahkmut the Russian positions in the pincers are less likely to be fortified since they are relatively new positions. And you can expect friction in communication between Wagner and MoD who man different sections of the line. How likely would people here rate an Ukranian offensive to collapse the Bahkmut pincers and advance towards Popasna? Especially if Ukraine can take some original LDNR land that might cause some serious panic on the opposite side of the war.\n\n\nAs a note, I do think the Ukranians are more likely to commit to more conventional directions of attack, like the south or north. But there is a lot if value in doing the unexpected and achieving a suprise against your opponement, so I wanted to discuss some of those unlikely possibilities.",

Perhaps it would be unexpected for there to be a counter offensive in the DNR/LNR, but is it worth going through the best fortified positions the Russians have on the frontline? Forces have been degraded there, but can the Ukrainians confidently say that the mass of Russian troops there, which is still substantial, would fail to hold those fortifications?

They reduced their firing rate by 10x, its not a surprise at all that they last longer because of course that's what happens when you fire less shells. Anyways, at this rate and these production levels, they're going to have problems very soon again. \n\nYou: well maybe they can fire more shells if china hops into the war and North Korea gives them their 80 year old supply. \n\nYou're just not appreciating that people aren't claiming that Russia is stuck on some inflexible path to doom, they're saying that Russia is on a troubled path. Your points, which is (1) Russia decided to change paths so the path originally wasn't troubled and (2) Russia can keep going on these paths if China and North Korea take the trouble away are simply not useful points.\n\nIn the first case, after all these descriptions, you're near downright purposefully or neglectfully portraying people wrong. Yeah Russia has missiles still. Any reason you're not also mentioning that attacks have severely decreased? \n\nIn the second point, sure, Russia can do all these things hypothetically. Does that change anything about the original comment, which is that Ukraine is slowly benefitting as time goes on, as current trends are showing a decreasing Russian stock? \n\nOutside intervention could help. NO ONE is saying that isn't possible. But the way you present yourself here doesn't help, because you're basically dependent on hypotheticals that belong to a different discussion. \n\n\nYour \"just reminding people\" is just simply extremely inaccurate. And if China did help, and 6 months later you said \"people said Russia was running out of tanks... now they have Chinese tanks. Look how wrong they were\" \nWell, no duh, the math changes considerably if that happens. That doesn't mean the original math isn't wrong, the formulas changed. \n\nIt's not devils advocate, it's simply strawmanning past statements and then begging the question with future ones. \nOriginal point: Russia can't keep up this rate of attack without running out of missiles\nYou: Russia didn't run out of missiles you were wrong . You also Forgot to mention that Russia didn't keep up this rate of attack.\n\nPoint now: Russia military is weakening over time from attrition and lack of resources at current rates\nYou: well if you assume that rates go through the sky, then attrition is not a problem \nThat's called begging the question. You assuming that the problem will magically fix itself isn't useful. \n\nYou can argue why you think china might help. Or how russia might increase production, or why north Korea will accept deals. \n\nBut simply saying \"you know, they might, therefore, this isn't really a problem\" is like Y2K all over again. Yeah, if you fix the problem, there's no problem. I don't think anyone disagrees.",

Your points, which is (1) Russia decided to change paths so the path originally wasn&#39;t troubled and (2) Russia can keep going on these paths if China and North Korea take the trouble away are simply not useful points.</p>\n\n<p>In the first case, after all these descriptions, you&#39;re near downright purposefully or neglectfully portraying people wrong. Yeah Russia has missiles still. Any reason you&#39;re not also mentioning that attacks have severely decreased? </p>\n\n<p>In the second point, sure, Russia can do all these things hypothetically. Does that change anything about the original comment, which is that Ukraine is slowly benefitting as time goes on, as current trends are showing a decreasing Russian stock? </p>\n\n<p>Outside intervention could help. NO ONE is saying that isn&#39;t possible. But the way you present yourself here doesn&#39;t help, because you&#39;re basically dependent on hypotheticals that belong to a different discussion. </p>\n\n<p>Your &quot;just reminding people&quot; is just simply extremely inaccurate. And if China did help, and 6 months later you said &quot;people said Russia was running out of tanks... now they have Chinese tanks. Look how wrong they were&quot; \nWell, no duh, the math changes considerably if that happens. That doesn&#39;t mean the original math isn&#39;t wrong, the formulas changed. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s not devils advocate, it&#39;s simply strawmanning past statements and then begging the question with future ones. \nOriginal point: Russia can&#39;t keep up this rate of attack without running out of missiles\nYou: Russia didn&#39;t run out of missiles you were wrong . You also Forgot to mention that Russia didn&#39;t keep up this rate of attack.</p>\n\n<p>Point now: Russia military is weakening over time from attrition and lack of resources at current rates\nYou: well if you assume that rates go through the sky, then attrition is not a problem \nThat&#39;s called begging the question. You assuming that the problem will magically fix itself isn&#39;t useful. </p>\n\n<p>You can argue why you think china might help. Or how russia might increase production, or why north Korea will accept deals. </p>\n\n<p>But simply saying &quot;you know, they might, therefore, this isn&#39;t really a problem&quot; is like Y2K all over again. Yeah, if you fix the problem, there&#39;s no problem. I don&#39;t think anyone disagrees.</p>\n</div>",
