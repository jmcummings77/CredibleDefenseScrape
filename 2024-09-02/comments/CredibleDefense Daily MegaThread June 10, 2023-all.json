As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

I would bet Ukraine's ideal simulation of this offensive involves annihilating most of the Russian reserves on their approach.

I would bet Ukraine&#39;s ideal simulation of this offensive involves annihilating most of the Russian reserves on their approach.

Indeed there were some tests towards the end of the Tomcat's lifespan along just these lines, the Tom was still over powered and over radared against its likely early 21st century counterparts. \n\nThe Bush admin killed a ton of legacy systems to fund the war in Iraq, and budget sequestration under the next administration foreclosed or delayed many of the planned follow on programs which would have covered the gap. Particularly problematic, the Navy decided (or was forced to decide) that an all F/A-18 fleet was more efficient than a high/low fleet with -14s and -18s, despite the fact that the F-14 did things the -18 never has *and* was arguably better than the older legacy Hornets in a dogfight. The -14 was ultimately canceled in part because the Navy decided that, unlike with the USAF's F-15, the F-14 could not be converted into a bomb truck thanks to its swept wings, and so could not play a role in the GWOT. F-18s could do both, and so were better suited to winning Congressional approval. \n\nAs for the USAF, the R-40 and R-33 missiles, the pappy and grand pappy of the R-37m, were designed to accomplish specific missions. This was primarily intercepting American bombers at long range, flying high, and very fast. The U-2 and SR-71 programs were a consideration, as was the XB-70 Valkyrie program. Mated with the MiG-25, which still holds many altitude and speed records, these missiles could do just that. These missiles were repurposed in the 1980s, in particular the R-33, to kill American AWACs at extremely long range. The Soviets planned to execute a (literal) high-low strategy to win air superiority over West Germany. Airborne C&C would be engaged and destroyed by MiG-25/-31s at long range, and these would then engage F-15s in a long range BVR duel. Su-27s/MiG-29s would then race in low and face, get under American fighters, and then attack them from underneath with IR guided missiles within the MAR of Soviet missiles. You thus see these missions reflected in the design of late-Soviet fighters and missiles. Meanwhile US fighters were armed with the AIM-7 and, though it arrived too late for Desert Storm and the Cold War, the AIM-120. Both missiles are great at mid-to-long (but not crazy long) ranges, and would have been perfect against aggressively moving Soviet fighters. There was never any need to develop ultra-long range missiles, because F-15s and -16s would have never fought that fight, and outside of naval aviation the Soviets were bigger fans of their strategic missile forces (which were good) than their strategic bombers (which were bad). The Soviets also relied very heavily on ground based direction. So you see the USAF focus on engaging fighters, light bombers, and ground based radars to win the central air battle, while the Soviets contemplated a number of bigger, further, faster targets as a natural extension of the kind of air force they faced. \n\nAnd then we loop back to the 'peace dividend' of the 90s and the 'war debt' of the 2000s as to why the US never moved past its late-Cold War weapons.",

It would even work better as a feint if they committed many of the new well equipped brigades, that would really sell it that it's the main effort. \n\nI'm at a loss that the current major offensive both started within days of each other in the same front but nothing big in the East yet.

Maybe. \n\nFor me, the big unknown is how many Mobiks the Russians left in their strategic rear uncommitted. If a large number are uncommitted, the Russians won't need to reshuffle units from the East to the South. But if there aren't a lot, or they aren't in organized units and instead meant to be fed in as replacements, all bets are off and the Russians will need to reshuffle units, which means the East might become vulnerable.\n\nAnother unknown is the Ukrainian strategy for this offensive. What are their actual goals? Is this about cutting the Land Bridge? Getting most of Crimea into range of long range PGMs? Max Russian attrition? Total square km of liberated terrain? Etc. Without knowing that, which without a leak probably won't be known for years, we can't really know anything.\n\nLook at last summer-fall. The UAF's highly telegraphed offensive to the South wasn't a feint, it was originally supposed to be a dual attack against the Kherson bridgehead and the Melitopol axis, but the latter part was cancelled after the US brass convinced them it wouldn't work. But with only one front active, the UAF needed another big attack to act as a fixing action, which is all the Kharkiv counteroffensive was intended to be. Whereas it ended up being way more successful than the main effort.\n\nThe Ukrainians have the resources to be audacious but need the flexibility to be creative Hopefully they are. \n\nEveryone is so focused on whether the Ukrainians are moving forward.

        "body": "Someone PM'd me and asked me this question and I felt it worth answering for anyone also curious: \n\n>Why did we see see such a long road bound column in the early period of the offensive, same as up north in Kiev, back in March 2022 with the Russians, even though the ground has probably mostly dried up by now?\n\n  \nFirst a brief description of vehicle formations. There are many different types of vehicle unit formations at the platoon and company, such as line, wedge, V, left or right echelon, and column, each with its own pros and cons. Column formation is the standard formation for wheeled support vehicles especially those that are road bound, and is used by tactical maneuver elements during admin movements and other that favor speed and control (follow the leaders), especially if they're in constrictive\u00a0terrain or stuck on highways,\u00a0roads, trails, lanes.\u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nA couple reasons why we see long columns:\n\n\\- Support (especially artillery) and supply vehicles typically travel on roads to facilitate mobility and efficient use of supply lines, especially wheeled vehicles like cargo trucks with limited offroad capabilities. While tactical vehicles, especially tracked, have significant offroad capabilities in comparison, especially in dry and open terrain like the Steppe of Zaporizhzhia oblast, due to their constant need to be resupplied, and that all resupply down to the lowest level is done by wheeled truck, they can't stray too far from the roads. Hence the need to keep all tactical axes of advance near a major road leading to their operational objectives.\u00a0\n\nThe bigger the road, the more cargo trucks can drive on it, the faster they can move (though there are definitely limits), and those vehicles are nearly always driving in column. Sometimes they get in traffic jams, hence the big ass column earlier in the war NW of Kyiv back in early March 2022. Or tactical formations, especially second echelon forces, they too will be roadbound while conducting road marches to the sectors they are supposed to fight in (and sometimes that becomes even more challenging, with the loss of certain roads or bridges due to combat ops, multiple units might be forces to share a single road and compete with operational level supply line too, creating even more traffic jams of vehicles in column formation).\u00a0  \n\n\\- Tactical maneuver units sometimes stage in column, to make the assembly easier if they know they must soon move quickly. For example, a dispersed number of platoons all lagered in 360 degree positions here and there and everywhere are given the signal to assemble and move out; that might take hours as units jostle to be in their planned march order before they can even start the movement, causing delays if they didn't plan for it. Or they all just assemble in column and park and wait for the go order, hoping they're not spotted let alone engaged.\u00a0\n\nThis was done regularly as far back as WW2, especially if the enemy didn't have air support that could detect and interdict those columns. For example, during the \"Battle of the Bulge,\" due to limited roads and too many units competing, plus bad weather negating Allied air for the first week, there was a German vehicle column that was reputed to be 120 km long.\u00a0\u00a0  \n\nAnd those types of targets is the bread and butter of tactical air forces, who much preferred deep air support/air interdiction of such juicy targets versus providing close air support over the front lines, not only being more survivable but allowing them to control the operations without being subordinated on call for ground forces (which is considered sacrilege for Air Power proponents). Without air, long range fires from long artillery (especially rocket), various types of long range PGMs, and now kamikaze drones can also attack them. \n\n\\- Mines and other obstacles: Along the \"Line of Contact\" (a term that is almost always misused in this war but used so commonly to refer to the \"front lines\" that we might as well ignore that it's being used improperly) between the forward outpost lines of the Ukrainians and the Russians is often about 1-2 kilometers minimum of open ground, sometimes over 5 km. In previous wars they've called it \"No man's land\" and in this war its commonly referred to as the \"Grey Zone.\" While it's lightly mined from previous shifting of lines, it's mostly under observation by either patrols, drones, or forward outpost lines.\u00a0\n\nThe Russian lines isn't the only one heavily mined and filled with other obstacles, the Ukrainian lines are also built in depth and heavily mined, so there are limited numbers of cleared routes to drive on to reach the forward positions where the assault elements can attempt to breach. Realistically, that distance could be as long as 10 kilometers or more. So the Ukrainians must drive through their own cleared lanes in column just to reach the line of departure where movement formations break up into individual combined arms team, each with their own purpose. Assault and breaching elements then have to keep traveling through the line of departure and into the attack point, also in at least platoon column due to mines. \n\nDepending on how far away from the objective, their level of engineering support, the number of tactical axes of advance, the strength of the defenses and the expected resistance, that would determine the size of each individual element and how long those columns will be, with the smallest likely being a combined arms company tactical team, a mix of tanks, infantry, engineers leading the way and sprinkled into the march formation, and maybe some other enablers like EW, ADA, etc.\u00a0I doubt platoons are operating independently with organic engineering support and their own objectives, but maybe I'm wrong.\n\nIf those get caught out in the open in the \"Grey Zone,\" and they're not obscured (one of the fundamentals of breaching operations is to obscure the breaching element), and if the Russian defenses aren't suppressed, then the assault force will get lit up with direct and indirect fires. Combine the losses sustained from that fire with losses sustained from trying to cross a massive and well constructed series of mine fields (which creates losses regardless of engineering vehicle support), and it creates a situation where the lead vehicle gets disabled, creating a traffic jam.\u00a0\n\nIf another engineering\u00a0vehicle isn't immediately available, a plow or roller (who can only take about 1-3 hits before being a mission kill), to peel out of the column to take point and carve a new lane, then forward progress ends. If follow-on forces were already moving down that cleared lane because they didn't get word that the lead vehicle was disabled, or they're escorting more engineer vehicles,\u00a0then the traffic jam grows. God forbid they come under heavy fire or even worse their rear vehicles are disabled too preventing reversing and backtracking, then they either die in place or abandoned their vehicles and retreat.\u00a0\n\nThe Russians looked like ass throughout the war and especially at Vulhedar because they didn't have an answer to this problem. And the Ukrainians had major issues previously, especially in Kherson last summer/fall but there wasn't much footage to show their issues like that just released. But nothing new happened in the last week.",

Lots of probing, lots of fires, find weak points, attrit the Russians, gain more intel about Russian tactical disposition and TTPs. That&#39;ll be costly too, and there can be arguments made whether Western equipment should be used for that purpose or put aside.</p>\n</div>",

It was obvious the Ukrainians were going to attack along the southern axes towards Melitopol and Mariupol, but now that they're in it, and so many of the better equipped new UAF brigades are known to be committed, of the UAF wait a bit and let that front heat up more, and the Russians commit more to reinforce it, then they'll be vulnerable in the Donbas.

These are basically office rooms built to specific standards (you can read the pdf's on some .gov website somewhere, I forget exactly which) which prevent most forms of electronic eavesdropping. It's stuff like building a conductive lining into all the walls, making sure air ducts have s curves and acoustic baffles, etc. It's also common for these rooms to have secure phones, video conferencing equipment, and workstations on the private DoD secure intranet. This is so that people working with SCI material can collaborate easily and remotely while keeping the material physically restricted.\n\nThese SCIFS are built into most high level federal offices. The President usually travels with a portable tent based one that can be set up when traveling abroad as a precaution. Trump had one built into Mar a Largo while he was president. I don't think that's a particularly uncommon arrangement, including some other senior government members having ones in their houses.\n\nAdditionally, SCI \"compartments\" are something you're read into on an individual basis, not like top secret which is just a broad lesser classification level. SCI is true need to know, and if you haven't been indoctrinated into the compartment, for all intents and purposes you won't know it exists.

            "body": "I am not very familiar with American law in this regard, so I can't really say much about some of the judicial procedure and higher-level legislation, but there are historical precedents for *some* of these, and American legislation is fairly similar to some Western legislation that I'm somewhat more familiar with. It's kind of hard to give an exact answer to any of these without knowing the exact context, but maybe some general points apply.\n\n> 1) If Trump actually transferred secrets to 3rd parties does it make sense that the government/DOJ would keep this information secret since proving the allegations might reveal methods and sources which are themselves highly secret?\n\nIt makes sense that they would keep the *exact information* being revealed a secret but the actual fact that someone transferred secrets to 3rd parties can probably be made public without risk. There's certainly a good deal of precedent for that. The American public is probably most familiar with the cases of Aldrich Ames and Robert Hanssen -- they were arrested, tried and convicted and the public generally knew all that was happening, but not the exact details.\n\nThese two cases are sort of special because both had been spying for a very long time, so it was possible to release some of the secrets they'd passed on very early because, by then, they were either useless or no longer secrets. But, in any case, you can certainly disclose that someone breached the Espionage Act without publicly explaining every detail of how.\n\nI'm not sure if American legislation allows for this but under some Western jurisdictions, the way this is handled is through specially-appointed judges, who can hear cases on matters of national security. The trials aren't public per se (as in you can't go and sit in court without a clearance) but some details are public in order to ensure everyone still has the right to defense and due process. The exact sentence being passed isn't fully released, but it's usually not kept sealed forever, it becomes a matter of public record after some time.\n\n> 2) if a person attempted to transfer national secrets I assume the act of doing so undetected would be quite difficult given a sophisticated counter-intelligence operation. Reading the reports of documents kept unguarded, unlocked in closets of Mar-a-logo within reach of guests - which I assume hundreds of people might flow in and out of the resort seems to me like a great way to do it.\n\nIt's a little more complicated than that.\n\nFirst of all, lots of stuff is secret just because it's kind of better to be safe than sorry. For instance, where I'm from, the data that eventually gets collated into annual statistics that the Ministry of Finance has to publish *by law* is rated secret while it's being compiled. Most of it becomes public afterwards but, until it does, it's classified to prevent things like insider trading and the like. So lots of secret material is in fact entirely mundane, very boring, and secret more because it's fresh than anything else (i.e. it's not super secret data that nobody can access, it's data someone might obtain if they bothered, but most people don't because they have better things to do than count how many ships docked in a port or whatever).\n\nConsequently there's just *tons* of it. Lots and lots and lots of paper which absolutely shouldn't be stored in a locker where access isn't strictly logged, controlled, and restricted to people with the proper clearance, but also lots of data is so boring that it gets improperly stored all the time and nothing bad happens. Right up until it does, that is. Much of it is sometimes useless unless it's leaked in its entirety, or at least in a large enough quantity, too, so the fact that it's improperly stored sometimes has zero consequences just because no one can leak enough of it to be dangerous.\n\nSecond, and this is probably the part that's less obvious and sort of answers \\#3 as well: politicians usually do not get direct reports, except if it's a matter of extreme urgency and there's just no way around it and they really need to know exactly where the information comes from and how. Data can even be shared among agencies -- which one would otherwise be tempted to think are perfectly adept at keeping secrets, given that it's what they do -- without disclosing either the initial reports or the source who made them. During the Cold War, for instance, British intelligence services shared some of the intelligence reports they got through Oleg Gordievsky with American services, without disclosing the source and without actually forwarding reports.\n\nWhat happens most of the time is that data is collated in internal reports, and then based on *those*, you come up with the briefing materials for everyone else. So the reports that everyone gets -- even the president, in many cases -- contain only a part of the information from internal reports compiled based on the initial source reports.\n\nSo the exact nature of the information everyone knows varies quite a bit, and so does what and how they can disclose, and how well you can defend against that.\n\nAn analyst, for example, might have access to exact shipping records from ships passing through, I dunno, the Straits of the World. That may be an encrypted USB stick that they have to log in and out at work, which is hard to take out of their office because they're searched when they leave the building and so on. So if you're working for Sauron and want to disclose that data, it may be difficult. The president, ironically enough, may have immediate access to far less data than his analysts, and may just know that a ship sailing under Rohan flag will carry a transport of genetically-engineered bats on Midsummer's eve. But all he has to do in order to disclose *that* is tell it to the military attache at a reception, and the whole extent of his knowledge may be a two-paragraph entry in a report that he can just take a photo of with his phone or whatever.\n\n> 3) I assume top secret data would be stored encrypted in databases/electronic document management systems created specifically for this purpose, and a defined process for viewing documents exists which ensures all activities are logged. This implies someone knows exactly who took what documents. Is this true, or does the system have holes that allow undocumented access?\n\nIt's true but then again, see \\#2. But there are a few caveats.\n\nFirst, the sad reality is that lots of politicians with access to high level sources are extremely careless with secret documents. They take them to study at home, on the road if they're travelling, they forget about them and so on. That's one of the reasons why not only sources, but most of the time even raw data is often obscured.\n\nSecond, while it's usually pretty straightforward to figure out who took what documents (there's usually an access register), it's not equally easy to control who copies them, and the further up you go on the food chain, the more lax controls are. Junior analysts would have a hard time exfiltrating anything but senators could probably snap photos of reports containing secret data today and show them to someone spooky tomorrow, and no one would know for a while.\n\nConsequently, it's not very difficult to find out who took what documents; but it's not very easy to find out who they disclosed the information in those documents *to*, and more importantly, frightening though it may sound, it's usually impossible to prevent people in sufficiently high positions from passing on information once they decide they want to do that, or if they just don't realise they're doing it. It's not always hard to catch them if they do, but unless you're a junior analyst who can't even sharpen their pencil without someone scrutinizing it, chances are the first pass is free.",

I recall reading that someone once caught Texeira taking notes on classified info and attempting to leave the secure space with the notes, I forget if he was stopped in that incident but it is telling that he was not completely stripped of all access immediately.

For months across several Discord servers this person was sharing clearance required information and they only recently stopped him after the relevant agencies were notified. I recall reading that someone once caught Texeira taking notes on classified info and attempting to leave the secure space with the notes, I forget if he was stopped in that incident but it is telling that he was not completely stripped of all access immediately.

        "body": "My general thoughts on how this will play out in the South: I think the Ukranians will push the Velyka Novosilka and Vuhledar attacks significantly more than they did in the first week, as I believe it is their best chance to threaten a breakthrough. The reason for this is simple, Russian defences and fortifications along this axis are significantly less than in the Zaporozhye direction. Ukranians can employ more mobile mechanized infantry and more variable attack vectors to capture towns(which they have already successfully done) instead of being bogged down with heavy equipment in presighted lines as they were in the Tokmak direction. If Ukraine can capture enough territory and threaten a breakthrough along the only major line of defense, Russian reserves will be forced to commit. I think Ukraine is hoping to knock these reserves out and carry out their main attacks toward Tokmak and Melipitol.\n\nOver the coming days(weeks?) the Russians will cede towns along the river and down this axis. We are seeing this with the Russian withdrawal from first Neskuchne and maybe Blahodatne. Novadonetske has already been captured, Novadarivka and Urozhaine will probably be captured soon. These attacks will probably be relatively conservative as the Ukranians seek to conserve the bulk of their offensive forces for a decisive thrust. The Russians will conduct local counterattacks which might result in certain towns being recaptured or recontested for a short time but will ultimately retreat(or be pushed out) to the main defensive line from Volnovakha to Novopetrykivka. How effective these counterattacks are depends on the quality of Russian forces in the area.\n\nAlong the Robotyne - Tokmak and Lobkove axis, I'll be honest to the point of doomerism. I do not believe the Ukranians can make any significant progress down both these axis without first breaking through the Velyka Novosilka - Vuhledar front or destroying an incredible amount of Russian reserves(something I think the Velyka Novosilka - Vuhledar attacks intend to do). Obviously the Russian logistics in this area are unknown and Ukraine could knock out enough rotating material/troops to make a difference, but I think this is unlikely.There might be attacks down the Huilapole direction but not to any significant extent. I think any attacks down this direction will also only be to bait Russian reserves into play.\n\nI agree with what other redditors have commented. The overall strategy from the Ukranian side seems to be to try and bait Russian reserves into overcommitting and destroying them when they do so. If they breakthrough the Vuhledar axis and destroy a significant portion of Russian reserves, or threaten a breakthrough and catch them with HIMARS/artillery, they can resume their main thrusts toward Tokmak and Melipitol. This all depends on how the Russians respond and how well they can execute their defense in depth doctrine.\n\nThis is purely speculation and I am interested in hearing your thoughts about this\n\nEdit: this is assuming the objective of the counter offensive is Tokmak - Melipotol to begin to isolate Crimea. I suppose Ukraine could try to take Mariupol or direct the bulk of their offensive forces in the Luhansk direction but I don't see that happening.",

Assuming their objective is Tokmak - Melitopol, Ukraine has to breach multiple extremely fortified defensive lines in a straight push using purely infantry, mechanized infantry, and tanks. They are advancing through dense minefields, presighted artillery, aviation all while being under drone surveillance and contending with Russia's reserve forces.\n\nIts practically impossible for Ukraine to concentrate and attack before Russia is aware of any significant concentration in advance at least in the Tokmak direction. We have some proof of this when Ukraine's first pushes toward Tokmak were completely annihilated before they could even push past Robotyne.\n\nI think the hope is that precision weapons like Himars will be able to hit concentrated and overcomitted Russian equipment while counterbattery from Ukranian artillery can destroy fixed Russian fortifications and defenses. Thus, when Ukraine hopefully breaks through the first defensive line, the Russians will be degraded to the point that subsequent defensive lines will be undermanned and quickly overrun.\n\nElements of this strategy are already in play. We have seen Ukraine carry out precision strikes and counterbattery on Russian artillery, tanks, and convoys. The Ukranian daily loss reports(while obviously propaganda) allegedly reflect a huge uptick in destroyed artillery due to counterbattery fire and drone drops. There were reports of Ukranians using RAAM systems to mine supply routes to catch rotating russian forces. How successful this truly is remains to be seen.\n\nEDIT: and yes I do believe Ukraine's forward elements were completely minced and counterattacked so common military thinking is correct. I know that Russian telegram sources are generally uncredible, but they can offer some glimpses in the frontline situation, and I haven't seen any panic in the Zaporozhye direction.

If you play or watch the game long enough you'll see repeats from time to time. One I remember very clearly because it was so brutal when some chess players were trying to get a perfect 100 in a row on guess the country, and now I just know it when it pop's up in other people's streams (if you're curious is finding yourself on a hiking trail in barren, arid, plant-less, mountain terrain that's all tan colored. This is usually a hiking trail near Golan and I don't know how you'd ever find it other than already knowing it. The chess player had been at it for like 36 hours and didn't wanna yolo, so they just kept clicking next to follow the trail for like 45 minutes or something and stumbled upon a fragment of half a person caught in the footage that had Hebrew on it, and finally he just guessed and got lucky even with that kind of brute force determination).\n\nAnother example of trivia, I forget which but there's one African nation where the google car is always followed by a police pickup truck. So again, you just have to randomly know that.\n\nI wouldn't say someone that knew all the geoguesser trivia would be useless to an intelligence agency, but I'd also think it'd be pretty low payoff vs the effort. Intel agencies have analysts with deep knowledge of the areas they specialize in, while geoguesser trivia is just a global grab bag of tricks that happen to work for that dataset. Someone who has cultural literacy in an area could provide far deeper insights.\n\nAlso geoguesser is a game where you're not supposed to cheat. But if you're the CIA, you literally can match a set of photos against \\*massive\\* internal databases with a few clicks. There's algorithms for recovering bearings from time of day plus shadow length measurements, ways to de-blur illegible text, etc. The intelligence community doesn't have to abide by \"no cheating\" they just want an answer.\n\nAlso the video is a pretty poor example of the idea of this as a general skill too. In that case all anyone needed to do was pixel peep enough to spot the logo on the bag/wrapper. Once you had that it's trivial google fu.",

The chess player had been at it for like 36 hours and didn&#39;t wanna yolo, so they just kept clicking next to follow the trail for like 45 minutes or something and stumbled upon a fragment of half a person caught in the footage that had Hebrew on it, and finally he just guessed and got lucky even with that kind of brute force determination).</p>\n\n<p>Another example of trivia, I forget which but there&#39;s one African nation where the google car is always followed by a police pickup truck. So again, you just have to randomly know that.</p>\n\n<p>I wouldn&#39;t say someone that knew all the geoguesser trivia would be useless to an intelligence agency, but I&#39;d also think it&#39;d be pretty low payoff vs the effort. Intel agencies have analysts with deep knowledge of the areas they specialize in, while geoguesser trivia is just a global grab bag of tricks that happen to work for that dataset. Someone who has cultural literacy in an area could provide far deeper insights.</p>\n\n<p>Also geoguesser is a game where you&#39;re not supposed to cheat. But if you&#39;re the CIA, you literally can match a set of photos against *massive* internal databases with a few clicks. There&#39;s algorithms for recovering bearings from time of day plus shadow length measurements, ways to de-blur illegible text, etc. The intelligence community doesn&#39;t have to abide by &quot;no cheating&quot; they just want an answer.</p>\n\n<p>Also the video is a pretty poor example of the idea of this as a general skill too. In that case all anyone needed to do was pixel peep enough to spot the logo on the bag/wrapper. Once you had that it&#39;s trivial google fu.</p>\n</div>",

They're an awkward bulky weapon only usable at short range and without heavy wind in your face.

A vehicle helps with bulk of course but you still have to ask yourself: in what situations would I prefer having the flame thrower vs an autocannon?\n\nAnother aspect is that RPGs, LAWs, and similar rockets have gotten both more accurate and more potent both since WW2. This has made them more of a preferred choice for infantry attacking fortifications. They're more versatile in general while still being effective at that job. Again, the question is when would I want the flame turret on a vehicle over something like an automatic grenade launcher. The latter can still do an astonishing amount of damage to fortifications or trenches, but with a whole menu of other ammunition choices as well.\n\nSo that's my basic recollection, that the various militaries of the world decided these weapons just weren't worth the downsides vs improved alternatives.",

A vehicle helps with bulk of course but you still have to ask yourself: in what situations would I prefer having the flame thrower vs an autocannon?</p>\n\n<p>Another aspect is that RPGs, LAWs, and similar rockets have gotten both more accurate and more potent both since WW2. This has made them more of a preferred choice for infantry attacking fortifications. They&#39;re more versatile in general while still being effective at that job. Again, the question is when would I want the flame turret on a vehicle over something like an automatic grenade launcher. The latter can still do an astonishing amount of damage to fortifications or trenches, but with a whole menu of other ammunition choices as well.</p>\n\n<p>So that&#39;s my basic recollection, that the various militaries of the world decided these weapons just weren&#39;t worth the downsides vs improved alternatives.</p>\n</div>",
