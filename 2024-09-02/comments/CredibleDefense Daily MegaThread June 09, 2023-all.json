      "selftext": "The r/CredibleDefense daily megathread is for asking questions and posting submissions that would not fit the criteria of our post submissions. As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster. Don't abuse it though! If something is not obviously against the rules but you still feel that it should be reviewed, leave a short but descriptive comment while filing the report.",

Extracting that commitment is what will allow Ukraine to make the next big bet. Now put yourself in Russia's place: if you know Ukraine has their prized Western trained and equipped in reserve, and all that's coming to the battle so far are domestically trained and equipped units, are you going to reveal your hand? Probably not. There's no shaping happening if the opponent feels no credible pressure to allow themselves to be shaped.\n* Newer equipment confers more survivability. Imagine if these initial assaults were conducted with old T-series tanks, BMPs, etc... the casualties would be horrific. As it stands, in a lot of the imagery coming out of the assaults so far, there are positive signs for personnel recovery - open hatches and deployment doors, blast pressure redirection working as advertised, footage of Ukrainians examining damaged equipment. This would be a very different story with Soviet derived equipment. Better to use and lose some of the good stuff and have soldiers for tomorrow and lessons learned than a burning wreck with no one returning to fight again.\n* Newer equipment confers more lethality. Better optics, longer engagement ranges, improved firing characteristics/munitions, etc. If you can't kill the opponent, they won't leave. So you will take losses... but so will they. Otherwise, what are you doing other than going out and getting slaughtered for no progress? Remember that the previous point also reduces that slaughter.\n* The western trained units needed to see real battle at some point... do you really want to hold them back like trophy formations while the rest of the army throws itself into the breach to die for a breakthrough, and then see your prized units completely fail to exploit that breakthrough out of greenness?\n\nAnd all that aside, there has been little noise, comparatively, about Soviet derived vehicle participation in the offensive. It's entirely possible they ARE out there forming the bulk of the operation and we're only seeing this snapshot because obviously Russia wants us to see the destruction of Western equipment. Assume everything from each side is cherry picked when it first appears... it takes days, even weeks (especially with UA on much tighter OPSEC) to see the wider context. We will know if this is the squandering of Western equipment, or simply the price of a breakthrough, in due time (and it might not be a timeline to your liking).",

Russian EW systems were well tested and effective against civilian systems in Syria.

Only after that could the dismounts start assaulting the trenches, bunkers, etc, and that wouldn't be a walk in the part either. To accomplish success they'd need to start with sufficient strength that after casualties during the approach they'd still have the combat power and morale to carry out a successful attack penetrating the lines in depth. Not very likely, we saw on the western outskirts of Bakhmut what happens to infantry dismounts moving through the open. \n\nUnfortunately, in that sector of Zaporizhzhia the attack likely needs to be conducted by armored vehicles, as they have the speed, off-road mobility, and armored protection to hope to survive the breach. \n\nThe issue is, due to mines, the UAF are forced to move in column formation behind engineering vehicles, which aren't nearly as effective as many think. MICLIC has a ~25-50% failure rate for its own line charge properly detonating after firing (requiring engineers dismount and plant demo on the line charge to detonate by hand), let alone the overpressure successfully neutralizing all the mines in its path; it requires proofing with a roller for a reason. And rollers and plows are not invulnerable, they're usually only good for 1-3 mine strikes before the roller/plow or the vehicle itself are damaged and rendered as a mission kill. And there are LOTS of mines, the average depth of a single field based on Soviet defensive doctrine (which the Russians still follow) is 300 meters. \n\nWhich means every armored column needs redundant engineering vehicles (finite supply) in the lead capable of moving through all obstacle belts before they can fan out and assault the actual defensive lines with fires, dismounted troops, etc. Not to mention potentially needing more engineering support to cross tank ditches, deal with dragons teeth, etc. \n\nMeanwhile, they're under observation the whole time, which means getting hammered by direct and indirect fire that are especially targeting engineering equipment and point elements in the columns trying to cause traffic jams. It's the same thing the Russians dealt with in the last year. When that happens, and there isn't another engineer vehicle immediately ready to peal out of the column, take point, and create a new cleared lane for everyone to follow, everyone waits until they're targeted by arty or something worse and destroyed, hence the mass abandonment of operational vehicles (especially if rearward vehicles are disabled/destroyed trying to reverse). \n\nThat sector of Zaporizhzhia is some of the hardest terrain to attack, especially considering the Ukrainians apparently can't follow the first two parts of the fundamentals of breaching, they didn't suppress Russian defenses, nor obscure their advance.\n\nIt's not surprising, the Russians have been waiting for an attack right there since late July 2022, so about 11 months to prepare. The Ukrainians attacked with zero surprise, everyone and their brother knew the offensive was coming and likely where it would hit. \n\nNot impossible to get through, just challenging and it will likely be costly for the Ukrainians in losses, ammo consumption, and political capital when it takes longer than anticipated. \n\nThe UAF would probably have more success going on the offensive in the Donbas region, there is pretty good terrain there to provide concealed avenues of approach, and the Ukrainians already hold some good terrain. It wouldn't surprise me if a third major operational axis for this strategic offensive opens up somewhere in the Donbas. Using only two for a massive counteroffensive, both in the same front, doesn't seem like a good strategy or one that UA would follow based on previous history.",

People care that ultimately Azerbaijan met its objectives and won the war. </p>\n\n<p>If Ukraine ultimately meets its objectives, you and no one else will care some Ukrainian commander seep-walked into losing some Bradleys that one time. If Ukraine does not ultimately meet its objectives, there will be far more substantive problems to be concerned about than some commander sleepwalking into losing some Bradleys. </p>\n\n<p>Try to keep your analysis in line with the bigger picture, and not reflexively jump to conclusions based on a poor news cycle. If you&#39;re incapable of doing so, it&#39;s probably healthy for you and everyone else to unplug for some time. Your poasting and your stress isn&#39;t going to change the outcome.</p>\n</div>",

While Russia has been able to afford to lose many battles, and can still afford to lose many more. \n\nI think the way this battle plays out is going to have a big outcome on how the war plays out, because Ukraine can't afford to get bogged down. There is a huge amount of territory they need to liberate. The Azeris had to take back 3,000sqkm of ground. For Ukraine, they need to take back roughly 100,000sqkm. They can't afford slow attritional grinds that take months on end to liberate only some territory. In short, they need dramatic victories like we saw at Kharkiv, a general breakthrough, to really have any hope of liberating the rest of the country in a timely manner. Whenever I say this people seem genuinely upset to expect Ukraine needs a big win. Even at a rate of liberating 10,000sqkm per year (more than the Kherson and Kharkiv offensives *combined*), this war would last 10 more years, which would be ruinous for Ukraine. \n\nIt seems like to me some people are way too heavily invested in their conception of the UAF to believe they could actually be doing as poorly as it *might* look right now. Like, won't even consider it as a thought exercise. It's been brought up many times before by people way more credible than me that the UAF struggles as a professional fighting force as a majority conscript army with majority soviet-era style officer corps, but this has often been shrugged off because its been assumed that new brigades were being trained up to a NATO standard. I think a lot of people are completely unwilling to consider early accounts of bad news and are quick to dismiss anything that doesn't fit their preconceived notions. \n\nSo, yes we can't jump to conclusions, but we shouldn't be dismissing early reports out of hand either.

Kherson offensive was a grinding one that relied heavily on HIMARS (this was before Russian jamming systems kicked in too) and took very heavy casualties - it&#39;s easy to make these armchair takes when you&#39;re posting from a McDonald&#39;s and not getting volleyed by Russian artillery on flat terrain.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s a classic case of orientalism - Russians are incompetent buffoons and Ukrainians are misguided child that needs to be coddled by the West to win. No mention of how Ukrainian strategic retreats allowed them to successfully defend their most important areas and how their innovative approach to urban warfare saved their country. Reality is that Ukrainian doctrine is more of a hybrid that still relies on Soviet doctrine <em>that is most effective in fighting a war in Ukraine</em>.</p>\n\n<p>I apologize for this rant, everyone expects Ukrainian army to perform like junior child of the USA with Call of Duty Halo Killology tactics and heroics. This isn&#39;t Iraq.</p>\n</div>",

There are a couple of dead, but most are alive or wounded. The participants of the battle will be able to provide more precise information after some time. Please note that no one sent the convoy through a clean minefield. The photo shows a demining vehicle and a mine trawl. Most likely, it was leading the convoy before the shelling began. </p>\n\n<p>Again, as practice shows, the Russians are trying to manipulate the data and show allegedly huge failures on the part of the Ukrainian army. But the scale they are trying to show is not true.</p>\n\n<p>\ud83d\udcccRussia has been showing the same fragment of the battle for several days now, adding new elements from different angles, as it likes to do.

It began with an auxiliary strike west of Ugledar in the Volnovakha direction. At the same time attacks and demonstrations (with tactical objectives) were launched on the Donetsk Front in the Vodyanoye-Opytne area and tactical attacks were launched in the Bakhmut area. And the day before yesterday an offensive was launched in the main direction - near Orekhovo to Melitopol. As of today: auxiliary attacks by the AFU did not lead to any results except for heavy losses. Novodonetskoye was not taken, in other areas there were at best small tactical successes measured in a few kilometres of the \"grey zone\" and a few hundred metres deep into our forward positions. Near Donetsk - no change. Near Bakhmut - small (and insignificant from all points of view) tactical advances by the AFU. In the main direction, the enemy is going \"all-out\", persistently attacking our positions in order to break through the frontline. At the moment - after 24 hours of continuous fighting we know indirectly about insignificant incursions, no breakthroughs. But there are heavy casualties. Their considerable part is on minefields in the \"grey zone\" and from strikes of our aircraft there too. Suddenly it turned out that our aviation is ready for such a development, as a massed night attack, can shoot guided missiles at night no worse than during the day and prepared in advance for the attack of the enemy. Now the \"partners\" have two choices: to stop burning their reserves in frontal assaults, to crawl back and regroup (in fact, to wind up the offensive at its very beginning) or to try all the same - using the created significant advantage in the number of men and line units - to first sell the front and then try to break it (as they did last year at Davydov Brod in the Kherson region). I assume that the begun attacks will not be stopped by the enemy, they will not change the plans on the move and a long bloody battle is waiting for us. Depending on the success of the enemy, it may last from several days (4-5) to 2-3 weeks. If the enemy manages to achieve at least a minimum of encouraging success - he will strike and strike in the hope of a breakthrough. If not, the attacks will gradually fade as the losses increase. Once again, it should be stated that the evident direction of the main enemy's attacks did not allow the enemy to achieve operational surprise, as well as to divert the reserves to secondary targets and direct them (despite the hysteria of Prigozhin and Co, who seemed to be \"playing along\" with the partners) to Belgorod direction to repel DRG attacks (of course, this did not mean that they could not be repelled more effectively without using reserves from the Southern Front). Even in the most optimistic scenario we should not expect our counter-offensive after the repulsion of enemy's offensive - even after the defeat the enemy would still have serious superiority in manpower and number of combined arms units. Without extensive mobilization and creation of new armies and corps (300 thousand additional troops - at least more or less normally trained, armed and equipped) the Russian Armed Forces will not be able to successfully pursue the strategic objectives of defeating the enemy.\n\nHe doesn't say that Ukraine's future offensive actions are guaranteed to fail, which most Russian sources haven't claimed either (Putin himself is cautious, saying that Ukraine \"retains offensive potential\"), but he agrees with them in that the attacks that have taken place so far have failed to produce any significant results and incurred heavy losses.",

Fixed-wing UCAVs, be they High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) like the MQ-9, or Medium Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) like the TB2, lack the nimbleness, versatility, and concealability of an attack helicopter. While they may have similar sensors and some of the same armaments, HALE and MALE UCAVs are designed to provide continuous observation and strike capability from an exposed airborne position. They are vulnerable to SAM systems in a way that even attack helicopters are not, because they do not even have the ability to hug the terrain (or even quickly land, if needed). They also do not have the same variety of weapons and potential methods of attack as a modern attack helicopter offers, as attack helicopters can attack from both long and short range, with guided missiles, rockets (guided and unguided), guns, and more.

If they were employing them as they are now I think that number would be significantly lower. Maybe we're seeing a shift that the attack helicopters use case is significantly better suited to defensive operations? \n\nAs for your example about Longbow, why does the weapon system employed need to be radar guided? We've seen KA-52 using laser guided weapon systems to engage ground vehicles, do ground based SHORAD systems have LWRs fitted to them?

All of a sudden, Washington is reckoning with the fact that so many parts and pieces of munitions, planes, and ships it needs are being manufactured overseas, including in China.

                            "body": "Oh, okay, I think I get where you're coming from.\n\nSelective opening isn't *that* common for dams on rivers like the Dnieper. I think it's done with some rotation logic to it but because it's a large river flowing through a rather muddy plain, it's usually preferrable to keep all gates open, unless you have some specific reason not to. I'm not sure if this applies specifically to the Kakhovka dam -- I'm not familiar with its design specifically and, as a consequence, not with its operation in detail, either.\n\nBut you are right that dams are usually opened and closed to keep a certain steady-ish water level. If you look at the altimetry data in the post above, you'll notice that the water level was held near a steady baseline for years.\n\n> I imagined it was possible that they stopped maintaining the dam and managing gates after the withdraw from Kherson since they no longer controlled both sides of the river.\n\nThe Russian army controlled the left bank, the one with the machine hall and the administrative building, and the spillways cranes look like they moved all the time. The gates could definitely be managed throughout this time, you don't really need to control both banks for that.\n\nSome maintenance and inspection work does obviously require some collaboration from the other party, as in, they ought to at least not fire at the folks conducting the inspection. The occupation of objectives like dams is pretty well regulated by international legislation though, it's generally possible to work out a framework that allows even extraordinary repair work to be performed while military clashes occur. AFAIK there's no evidence the Ukrainian side interfered with maintenance, or wouldn't have allowed maintenance if it were requested, especially since it's a pretty stiffly regulated affair.\n\n> it seemed possible to me that too many gates were left closed at the time they stopped maintenance, so it wouldn't handle a rainier than average season in that state\n\nIt's *possible* but there's no reason to think the gates were just left closed because there was no other alternative, or it was no longer possible to open them.

I think it&#39;s done with some rotation logic to it but because it&#39;s a large river flowing through a rather muddy plain, it&#39;s usually preferrable to keep all gates open, unless you have some specific reason not to. I&#39;m not sure if this applies specifically to the Kakhovka dam -- I&#39;m not familiar with its design specifically and, as a consequence, not with its operation in detail, either.</p>\n\n<p>But you are right that dams are usually opened and closed to keep a certain steady-ish water level. If you look at the altimetry data in the post above, you&#39;ll notice that the water level was held near a steady baseline for years.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I imagined it was possible that they stopped maintaining the dam and managing gates after the withdraw from Kherson since they no longer controlled both sides of the river.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Russian army controlled the left bank, the one with the machine hall and the administrative building, and the spillways cranes look like they moved all the time. The gates could definitely be managed throughout this time, you don&#39;t really need to control both banks for that.</p>\n\n<p>Some maintenance and inspection work does obviously require some collaboration from the other party, as in, they ought to at least not fire at the folks conducting the inspection. The occupation of objectives like dams is pretty well regulated by international legislation though, it&#39;s generally possible to work out a framework that allows even extraordinary repair work to be performed while military clashes occur. AFAIK there&#39;s no evidence the Ukrainian side interfered with maintenance, or wouldn&#39;t have allowed maintenance if it were requested, especially since it&#39;s a pretty stiffly regulated affair.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>it seemed possible to me that too many gates were left closed at the time they stopped maintenance, so it wouldn&#39;t handle a rainier than average season in that state</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It&#39;s <em>possible</em> but there&#39;s no reason to think the gates were just left closed because there was no other alternative, or it was no longer possible to open them. Even in the worst possible case, where the control mechanisms give in, gates are mechanically sealed shut, you lose the gate cranes or whatever, there are repairs you can make and contingency plans in case the repairs fail or just aren&#39;t possible. The 4-6 weeks during which the reservoir was at record-high levels were more than sufficient to implement them.</p>\n</div>",

Politically, they need to score a big victory, which means liberating large amounts of terrain, preferably that which has strategic value with long term consequences, and/or significantly destroy Russian military capabilities/strength weakening them in the long run. They can't do that if they disperse their combat power (a violation of a thousands of years old principle of warfare) and avoid decisive battle.\n\nArmored success comes down to successful use of combined arms. Dispersing armor means every unit gets that much less combined arms support. It means nobody is the main effort for tracks, ammo, for EW support, for long range fires, etc. That level of egalitarian style of warfare is bad news and always has been, it means everyone gets an equally shitty amount of combat power and support. It means never having a localized advantage over the defender. It rarely means success. \n\nAircraft spotting for arty isn't new. Even back as far as WW2 many sides used manned aircraft for artillery spotting, plus obviously ground observers. The only difference now is they're smaller, unmanned, cheaper, and harder to neutralize though ADA or EW. There were countermeasures in '43, there are countermeasures now. Are they using them all? \n\nOverall, the issue here isn't about new tech or new doctrine, the issue is the same reason Pompey failed at Pharsalus. Not all plans are good plans, and even good plans sometimes don't work.\n\nLet's look at the basics. For the Zaporizhzhia push, did the Ukrainians have tactical, operational, or strategic surprise for these attacks? Absolutely not, everyone knew since LAST SUMMER that they were going to attack that location in force and the Russians have been preparing since. Did the Ukrainians effectively suppress Russian defenses, both forward lines, arty, EW, and air support to include ISTARS? Apparently not. Does Ukraine have the ability to do these things? Yes, they've demonstrated it at other times already in this war, just not in this case. Why not? Because somebody screwed up. Or bad luck. Or the Russians were on their game. \n\nVIctory in war usually comes down to who screws up less. It was VERY unlikely Ukraine was going to break through Russian lines on their first assault. When an assault fails, it means significant losses, burnt out vehicles and corpses. Not every battle is 73 Easting, not every war is Desert Storm. \n\nThe Ukrainians have built so many new brigades since January so they can keep doing this: attack, fall, lose troops and vehicles, try again. It's not that big of a deal. When it happens nonstop for weeks or even months, then it's a big deal. There is no indication right now that it will, calm down and let the situation develop before drawing conclusions.\n\n>The current operations contradict the crucial principle underscored by RUSI reports for this war: the necessity for forces to disperse and remain concealed.\n\nThat was not the crucial principle underscored by RUSI, who have deliberately barely discussed Ukrainian TTPs and lessons learned and nearly only focus on the Russians. Obviously concealment is necessary in certain times and conditions but it's not practical to decide that offensive operations beyond skirmishing at the platoon level isn't possible because, uh ohh, you might get spotted. If the combatant's primary objective isn't to be seen, they can't accomplish almost any mission. They definitely can't accomplish any offensive mission, and if they can't do offense it's time to sue for peace.",

            "body": "The problem you're describing is actually very, very complicated, and it's one of the aspects of social media that, despite a lot of active research, is very poorly understood.\n\nLet's start with the obvious part -- technically, this is generally feasible. \"War support\" can be correlated reasonably well with a number of interests, not just the things they say, so it's reasonably easy to identify a group of people that are supportive of the war at a given point and are within the target age.\n\nThe less obvious problems have to do with the correlation between this and military usefulness, and with the social impact this might have.\n\nThere are lots of reasons why mobilisation is universal, first of all. One of them is that selection from a wide pool, based on age and medical readiness alone, spreads the impact of mobilisation equally among economic sectors, and (at least in theory -- this is not the case in Russia) across the wider society. Except insofar as they are correlated with mobilisation age -- so except for sectors like sports, for example -- no single economic sector is overwhelmingly targeted, and the impact is similar among the poor and the rich, among the employed and the unemployed and so on. Every government that's tried to mess around with this too much -- most recently the US in Vietnam -- found out the hard way that it's a bad idea. Authoritarian regimes can *delay* the negative effects of messing around, but reality eventually catches up with them.\n\nHowever, there is a certain degree of correlation between \"desirable\" traits, like patriotism (with some caveats, and a whole lot of other things. Besides the obvious, like profession, lots of less obvious things, like [regional identification](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00168-022-01167-1), [economic compliance](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-0335.2011.00900.x), and even [consumer behaviour](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08961530802282232) are correlated to patriotism in various ways. \n\nSo even if it's not the intention of the mobilisation authorities -- in fact, it's usually something they try avoid  -- such a policy would end up having a disproportionate effect on some sectors of economy and some parts of society.\n\nThis isn't only a problem of social justice: the converse effect of mobilising people who show support for such a measure and getting them out on the front is that the proportion of *home* population that doesn't support this measure grows continuously, and there are fewer and fewer people to keep it in check.\n\nBut there is another assumption behind this idea that makes it even worse. In addition to interests and social media messages being imperfect indicators of \"real\" patriotism vs. posturing nationalism, social media makes it particularly difficult to identify the patriotic traits someone displays. While there is some correlations between values or ideological preferences and blind/constructive patriotism (see [this](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886914001445), or [this](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9221.2005.00412.x)), identification is difficult and ultimately very context-dependent, to the point where determining it through a social media platform is very difficult. \n\nConsequently, traits that correlate with support for general mobilisation do not necessarily correlate with military efficiency, especially *not* as a cohesive group. A group comprised of people with diverse backgrounds tends to even out all but deliberately educated tendencies, and can eventually build up excellent discipline. A group of mobilised, rather than professional soldiers, predominantly from the *same* group, usually ends up being a rag-tag, unreliable bunch of mentally-unstable hitmen, who are largely uncontrollable (and impossible to understand) by anyone outside their group. Think Chechen combatants, who make for excellent terror squads and social media teams but are practically useless as soon as they're subordinated to an actual military hierarchy, where they need to do what they're asked to do, rather than hang around and help with things they prefer to do and are therefore unlikely to botch too badly.\n\nA way to allow people who support mobilisation to get mobilised already exists: volunteer enrollment. It's an extremely reliable solution which provides a baseline filter (the risk of ending up with loudmouths who piss their pants the moment they see a gun is substantially lower, since loudmouth keyboard warriors are less likely to go sign up for the military of their own accord) and enables a degree of impact control and rotation. Biasing *in*voluntary conscription is a lot more risky, for comparatively very few gains.\n\nSo IMHO this would definitely *not* be a good idea. It would lead to economic and social imbalance at home, in addition to the economic and social imbalance already created by corruption. And it would likely lead to a *worse* mobilised force, not a better one.",

If you can persuade people that \"our side\" is in the right, one would assume that this would drive up actual war support that goes beyond shitposting on social media, wouldn't it?\n\nI'm really struggling to think about this in an abstract manner since the only real example of mass mobilization is Russia. The war is being prosecuted on shaky grounds, to say the least, and even though Russian state media has a chokehold on \"news,\" someone cheerleading the war online should also be able to get relatively unbiased information on the lead-up to the war, how the war's going, etc., and basically just cut through the bullshit that the government is selling.\n\nOn the other hand: Iraq, maybe? It's obviously not the same thing, and we weren't looking at mobilization, and that war, too, was waged with a less-than-credible casus belli. But even after the official government line was challenged (to put it diplomatically), we still saw lots and lots of people willingly sign up to go to Iraq. Sure, there's the GI Bill, the VA, and other external incentives, but I'd argue this all amounts to persuasion. \n\nIf people are angry and think they've been wronged, I'd say a government at war would have an easier time finding relatively eager volunteers or mobilized troops (or maybe fewer dodgers, rather). If a society is already fired up and calling for blood (Iraq) rather than totally apathetic (Russia), then *maybe* that microtargeting would be a good idea?

All units from Western-equipped and Western-trained brigades.</p>\n\n<p>We are not seeing one isolated example, but at least four. Not a trend, but not an isolated incident either.</p>\n</div>",

And here is the result of yesterday, an honest story almost from the first person from the trenches.\n\nhttps://www.kp*ru/daily/27514/4776643/ (replace * with .)\n\n[The story Khodakovsky linked follows]\n\n\u201cThe column was on us, despite the loss of 300 people\u201d: The whole truth from the trench on the main line of attack of the Armed Forces of Ukraine\n\nDmitry STESHIN\n\n\nA comrade got in touch, howling in the current direction of the \"main blow\" of the Ukrainian offensive , I already began to worry.\n\nThe first thing he confirmed was that yes, the tactics of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are simple - to squeeze out all the ammunition from the defenders, prevent the delivery and storage, use this wave to enter our positions and gain a foothold:\n\n- They operate in small groups, first they mow out the landing technique, then the infantry cleans up.\n\nMy interlocutor, whom I have known for a long time, remarked: - Our boys are heroes, they stand to the last.\n\nAnd this assessment means a lot to me. **It is deciphered as follows - \"fights are very difficult.\"**\n\n\n- There are many foreign tanks, they shoot very accurately, especially at night. On the \"Leopards\" teplyaks (thermal imagers) are fucking worth it.\n\n- Judging by the data of objective control, which appear on the Web almost every hour , ours are burning them with both Lancets and aviation? ..\n\n- A large column was moving yesterday, 50 units, we copied it from our observation post, where you were, but the aviation did not have time to work out. But we have already burned up to 50 units of any armour stray in this area.\n\nHow do you rate the intensity of the fights?\n\n- For two days they perlied specifically, despite the fact that on the first day they lost 300 people. Today, hell knows, they most likely have a regrouping. While the silence is relative, magnetic mines were scattered around the neighborhood, along the roads.\n\n- What do you think, did the NATO members learn them?\n\n- They learned by themselves, Dim, they have combat experience no less than ours.\n\n- Understood. How are you? Sat? Shoe-dressed? Are you able to sleep?\n\n\n- Yes, I'm fine.\n\nOnce again I was convinced that information in our age is distributed evenly. They knew in the trenches about the ambiguous speeches of some politicians in Moscow, and about the jingoistic patriots from the fiery sofas, who are now aggravated and spiritually uplifted ...

On the &quot;Leopards&quot; teplyaks (thermal imagers) are fucking worth it.</p></li>\n<li><p>Judging by the data of objective control, which appear on the Web almost every hour , ours are burning them with both Lancets and aviation? ..</p></li>\n<li><p>A large column was moving yesterday, 50 units, we copied it from our observation post, where you were, but the aviation did not have time to work out. But we have already burned up to 50 units of any armour stray in this area.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>How do you rate the intensity of the fights?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>For two days they perlied specifically, despite the fact that on the first day they lost 300 people. Today, hell knows, they most likely have a regrouping. While the silence is relative, magnetic mines were scattered around the neighborhood, along the roads.</p></li>\n<li><p>What do you think, did the NATO members learn them?</p></li>\n<li><p>They learned by themselves, Dim, they have combat experience no less than ours.</p></li>\n<li><p>Understood. How are you? Sat? Shoe-dressed? Are you able to sleep?</p></li>\n<li><p>Yes, I&#39;m fine.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Once again I was convinced that information in our age is distributed evenly.

Take the announcements more as a rough number but as for the actual number in theater have a tiny bit of skepticism and understand there is a HUGE gap in what we do not know and we publicly are only seeing what countries want us to see.  </p>\n\n<p>A few examples of this so far in the war that have some to light:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/national-security-daily/2022/08/22/is-the-u-s-giving-ukraine-some-weapons-secretly-00053079\">https://www.politico.com/newsletters/national-security-daily/2022/08/22/is-the-u-s-giving-ukraine-some-weapons-secretly-00053079</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/how-bulgaria-secretly-armed-ukraine-with-nato-weapons-deliveries/a-64478423\">https://www.dw.com/en/how-bulgaria-secretly-armed-ukraine-with-nato-weapons-deliveries/a-64478423</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/leaked-us-intel-document-claims-serbia-agreed-arm-ukraine-2023-04-12/\">https://www.reuters.com/world/leaked-us-intel-document-claims-serbia-agreed-arm-ukraine-2023-04-12/</a></p>\n</div>",

                                "body": "Those are great observations, so thanks.\n\nI should first point out that Russia hasn't 'conscripted' yet. That's down at the bottom of the list I posted above.\n\nI guess it could also be said that they haven't taken such measures because they don't - yet - need to. Occam's razor, and all. This might be down to bravado, ineptitude or some sucking-up mentality on behalf of the top brass, I have no idea... but there *are* possibilities other than 'fear of the public response,' say. Or it may be a combination of things, including reluctance for some reason, as you say.\n\nI'm not so sure Putin would risk failure based on such a reluctance though. He made his case for the SMO (and that was a tough ask for a population at peace and not being attacked) and seemed to prevail over public acceptance... so I think he'd try that again for any force increase with some confidence, given that the public might arguably be more 'patriotically-involved,' for example. But what do I know.\n\nI just don't see any negative impetus that would be sufficient to provoke an extreme-anti-war reaction. I could be wrong.\n\nI think the prisoner thing actually less 'extreme' than the similar scheme enacted in Ukraine, early on. Prisoners were simply conscripted by edict by Kiev (though to be fair, many were keen to get into the fight)... but there was no volunteering. Wagner was a choice, voluntarily fight for a pardon, or stay where you are. Wagner, obviously, is a PMC... and I'm not aware of any Russian prisoners being 'conscripted' in any way into the regular Armed Forces, unlike as in Ukraine. So, on balance, I don't see the prisoner issue as indicating an issue in either country in time of war; it is what it is.\n\nFWIW, my personal opinion is that the instant Russia ***does*** take measures including and beyond redefining the SMO, that'll be a certain indication that things aren't going well for them in Ukraine. Until that happens, I think it indicates that they are 'satisfied and comfortable' (however that might accurately be defined) with how things are going for them.\n\nThey've only increased the volunteer pool once, as a 'recruitment' measure and I think that was as a response to the early issue of manpower that you mentioned.",

That&#39;s down at the bottom of the list I posted above.</p>\n\n<p>I guess it could also be said that they haven&#39;t taken such measures because they don&#39;t - yet - need to. Occam&#39;s razor, and all. This might be down to bravado, ineptitude or some sucking-up mentality on behalf of the top brass, I have no idea... but there <em>are</em> possibilities other than &#39;fear of the public response,&#39; say. Or it may be a combination of things, including reluctance for some reason, as you say.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not so sure Putin would risk failure based on such a reluctance though. He made his case for the SMO (and that was a tough ask for a population at peace and not being attacked) and seemed to prevail over public acceptance... so I think he&#39;d try that again for any force increase with some confidence, given that the public might arguably be more &#39;patriotically-involved,&#39; for example. But what do I know.</p>\n\n<p>I just don&#39;t see any negative impetus that would be sufficient to provoke an extreme-anti-war reaction. I could be wrong.</p>\n\n<p>I think the prisoner thing actually less &#39;extreme&#39; than the similar scheme enacted in Ukraine, early on. Prisoners were simply conscripted by edict by Kiev (though to be fair, many were keen to get into the fight)... but there was no volunteering.
