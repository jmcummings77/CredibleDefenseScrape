The uncrewed system recently completed its first end-to-end test. The service hopes to begin fielding this capability next year, which will give all of its submarines an additional tool for scouting for mines and other hazards, gathering intelligence, and otherwise improving their situational awareness.*\n\n*The end-to-end Yellow Moray test took place last week, according to a Facebook post from the Navy's Submarine Readiness Squadron 32. The Virginia class attack submarine USS Delaware (SSN 791) served as the launch and recovery platform for the uncrewed underwater vehicle (UUV).*\n\n*Specific details about Yellow Moray are limited, but it is known to be a member of HII's REMUS series. The Navy has also talked in the past about the development of a subvariant or derivative of the Razorback UUV that can be launched and recovered via torpedo tube. Razorback is a version of the [REMUS 600](https://auvac.org/files/uploads/platform_pdf/remus600web.pdf), which was originally developed by Woods Hole's Oceanographic Systems Lab and was then initially produced by a company called Hydroid.*\n\n*All known versions of the REMUS 600 to date feature an antenna mast at the rear that allows the UUV to communicate while running close to the surface. Wireless Ethernet and Iridium satellite communications links are among the specific options for connecting these underwater drones to offboard platforms, such as ships and shore-based control nodes.*\n\n*The standard REMUS 600 is notably shorter, narrower, and lighter than the Navy's Mk 48 heavyweight torpedo, the standard torpedo armament for the service's submarines. Pictures that Submarine Readiness Squadron 32 shared of Yellow Moray show that it is narrower than a standard torpedo tube and also comes packaged in a straight-walled tubular canister. This could indicate that the fixed antenna mast found on other REMUS 600 variants has been deleted (which could have been replaced by a retractable mast or some other mounting arrangement) on the submarine-launched and recovered derivative. This all may also point to other differences in the external shape of the Yellow Moray and the REMUS 600.*\n\n*It's not immediately clear exactly how Yellow Moray is launched and recovered, and whether divers are required as part of either procedure. The Navy has developed other torpedo-tube-launched drones, as well as ones that can be deployed via Dry Deck Shelter (DDS) or other means, but recovery has historically been a challenge. It's also worth noting that the Navy canceled its Snakehead UUV program earlier this year in part because that design was too large to even work with existing DDSs.*\n\n*Being able to launch and recover UUVs via torpedo tube offers much greater flexibility, overall. The Navy has a limited number of DDSs, which are primarily intended to be used to deploy and retrieve special operations forces, and only a select group of Virginia and Ohio class submarines are certified to carry them.*\n\n*Yellow Moray is not the only such UUV the Navy is currently testing, either. \"Submarine Force Pacific conducted a similar Rat Trap exercise, where it successfully launched and recovered an L3Harris-made UUV from a submarine torpedo tube,\" according to [Defense News](https://www.defensenews.com/naval/2023/11/08/us-navy-tests-sub-launched-drones-while-industry-continues-designing/).*\n\n*\u201cI think we are very close to deploying a torpedo tube-launched and -recovered UUV here within the next year,\" Rear Adm. Gaucher had told Defense News last month. \"So that\u2019s going to be a big deal for us because success in that space is going to allow us to start operating at scale and putting these capabilities on every submarine.\"*\n\n*\u201cThere is a plan in place to deploy that in 2024,\" Gaucher added. \"Now, will we get there? We still have some testing to do, but that\u2019s our plan and that\u2019s what we\u2019re shooting for.\"*",

But also, being at the receiving end of this kind of leak is one of the ways in which Orban is slowly learning what every second-rate politician who didn't learn from the mistakes of Brezhnev-era Soviet Union had to learn the hard way, that a foreign policy based solely on opposition tends to reduce influence in the long run.\n\nThese \"signals\" may or may not be real. It's not like Kuleba is physically unable to lie, so let's keep that possibility in mind, but they may also very well be just the result of a misunderstanding.\n\nIf they *are* real, this is a good way for the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry to give their Hungarian counterparts less room to walk back on their promise, informal though it may have been. Its public character is part of what makes a formal commitment substantial. And (although I may be giving the Hungarian Foreign Ministry far too much credit here, but who knows, maybe they finally called their two employees who actually attended introductory IR courses back to office?) it may well be a well-calculated leak that both sides agreed on, as it gives their Russian counterparts some time to cool off before the \"window of opportunity\" publicly opens. \n\nIf they aren't real, and there is truly no point in even attempting to negotiate anymore, this is a good way to increase pressure on the Hungarian government. First, it plays on the paranoia of the Russian political establishment. If this is indeed a lie, the Hungarian foreign ministry is obviously going to deny it but, contrary to popular belief, there is no honour among thieves so there isn't much trust to go around, either. Second, it plays on Orban's not entirely baselessly hollow public image. The man won't shut up about sovereignty but if he denies these signals, to the people who actually hoped Hungary might walk back on its absurd stance on EU membership negotiations it will, once again, look like Hungary has about as much sovereignty as Moscow allows its prime minister to have.\n\nEither way, this is a very bad corner that Orban has painted himself in. Most EU countries bicker over the relative sizes of budgets and about which projects to fund, surely an absurd and extremely boring show to watch but ultimately constructive in nature. Hungary, in the meantime, having been unable to contribute by doing anything other than saying \"no\" for about a decade now, is now throwing all of the precious little influence on securing funds they would've been entitled to in the first place if they'd acted like an EU member, and on the pointless exercise of preventing the opening of EU membership negotiations. (Pointless, that is, at least in terms of European politics. It's obviously a useful act on Moscow's agenda but if the preservation of European anti-corruption and agricultural policies is what actually matters, preventing talks just gets you flak for no discernible gain, as the *conclusion* of membership negotiations also requires consensus. You can just delay them there, and it looks like you're looking out for European, rather than Russian citizens.)\n\nThis is not the kind of stunt you'd see played on Hungary if their recent foreign policy (and foreign conduct in general) had been at least credible. The fact that they're being treated like this, whether their signals are real or not, should get people upstairs really concerned. This is the kind of stunt Kissinger, may his sleep be as comfortable as stepping on legos, used to play on third-world countries and get his junior staff members all worked up about why people hate them.",

But some lawmakers argue it means Ukraine won\u2019t be truly threatened if Congress fails to agree to a White House request for new funding before lawmakers head off for the holidays at the end of the week.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat you are giving out in PDA is actual physical equipment, it doesn\u2019t involve funds,\u201d said Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee and one of his party\u2019s leading supporters of Ukraine in its fight against Russia\u2019s invasion. \u201cIt would be better to pass the bill this month for a number of reasons, but we can make it work to wait until next month.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThere is no statutory requirement to replace equipment sent to allies under the PDA,\u201d said Mark Cancian, a former Office of Management and Budget defense specialist. \u201cIn theory, DoD could keep sending weapons and munitions even if there was no money available to replace them.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhile some might argue that the risk is worth accepting, others would describe it as unilateral disarmament,\u201d said Cancian, now a defense analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies.</p>\n\n<p>The prospect of a workaround for coming weeks isn\u2019t one the Pentagon wants to think about \u2014 at least for now.</p>\n\n<p>Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks said in an interview Monday that the US probably will have expended all of its funds around the end of the year, while noting that deliveries tend to lag expenditures.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis is a critical period of time, and we need Congress to act,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will use every authority that we can, but we are coming close to the end of what we have available to us as an authority.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>A decision to keep sending arms to Ukraine would force the Department of Defense \u2014 particularly the Army \u2014 to assume the risk the inventory wouldn\u2019t be replaced or the already lengthy process to issue contracts and produce the replenish the arms would be further delayed.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, the dispute over the supplemental funding request, with its focus on domestic political considerations, \u201cis really now an American story,\u201d said John Herbst, a former US ambassador to Ukraine who is now senior director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously a very important Ukrainian element, but the dynamics are overwhelmingly American.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

The Sentinel will need to be well protected from cyberattacks, while its technology will have to cope with frigid winter temperatures in the Western states where the silos are located.\n\n>The $96 billion Sentinel overhaul involves 450 silos across five states, their control centers, three nuclear missile bases and several other testing facilities.

Each individual plane has enormous redundancy built in to its design, that's precisely why they are so safe. A commercial airline jet is a complete system including an entire complement of redundant backup systems, such as multiple engines, multiple flight computers, and at least two highly trained professionals monitoring the plane continuously, ready to manually correct any issues resulting from software errors at a moment's notice, well before any risk of fatalities can even arise. You are comparing that complete system's performance to a single physical server, even though a single physical server is never sufficient on its own to host any non-trivial webservice with uptime requirements past around four 9s, simply because security patches alone will take an individual server down for a few hours every year. And certainly there are not two trained DevOps engineers hovering over each individual server's controls constantly while it is in operation, ready to leap into action to correct any defects impacting service availability within seconds of the defect occurring. \n\nAlso your IT uptime requirement is round-the-clock, whereas planes spend substantial amounts of time on the ground receiving maintenance, not delivering service segments. On that basis alone, the analogy is flawed because it ignores the downtime planes are permitted for maintenance while not reducing the uptime requirements for the web servers in a corresponding manner to account for the comparable routine downtime they would also need for maintenance.\n\nAny non-trivial web service relies on multiple redundant physical servers, which is necessary at a minimum to allow for rolling security patches so that at least some of the servers are available at all times. A single server alone literally just cannot stay up 24/7/365 without needing to be patched and rebooted eventually, so it's not even really worth talking about reliability in terms of just one physical box, at least not any more than it makes sense to talk about the reliability of one engine of an airplane without considering the other redundant systems that increase the total system reliability past what the individual component can achieve on its own. No one runs a (serious) web service with just one physical server and no one flies a commercial jet with just one engine.\n\nA relatively simple web service deployment to a Kubernetes cluster with replicated service instances hosted across multiple physical nodes configured for georedundancy and availability zone redundancy can achieve uptimes easily in the five 9s range with essentially no engineering effort, just by configuring the k8s cluster correctly for whatever cloud services provider you are using. In such an architecture, the cluster is analogous to the plane, in that it is the entire system (mostly, things are blurrier when it comes to virtual boundaries than physical ones, obviously, so it's not as clear where the system boundary is for a web service compared to a physical vehicle like a plane). The individual physical servers forming the cluster are thus analogous to the various individual redundant components of the plane, e.g. engines, airframe, flight computer, pilots. One can go down and the system as a whole will still remain up.",

So he&#39;s trying to draw up the battle lines of the campaign.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-12-12/ty-article/.premium/israel-is-at-war-and-netanyahu-just-launched-his-re-election-campaign/0000018c-5f3f-de43-affd-ff3ff7c60000\">https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-12-12/ty-article/.premium/israel-is-at-war-and-netanyahu-just-launched-his-re-election-campaign/0000018c-5f3f-de43-affd-ff3ff7c60000</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://archive.ph/rCg4R#selection-1053.0-1064.0\">https://archive.ph/rCg4R#selection-1053.0-1064.0</a></p>\n</div>",

As you say, they're essentially just revisionist powers that lack the strength to fully realize geopolitical change outright, so they're instead looking to erode the existing system. But their goals are the same as revisionists, and arguably the outcome of their actions is the same too. For example, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has absolutely upended the global order that existed before February 2022, with great power competition back at the forefront and countries the world over reevaluating their security arrangements (Sweden and Finland in NATO, Japan rearming, Japan-SK detente, new US security agreements in Pacific with Phillipines, etc).\n\nThat being said, there is some value in denoting which revisionist powers actually have the capability to effect meaningful change to the global order (China, arguably Russia) from those that seek change but lack the power to actually do so (Iran, Venezuela? North Korea?). So labeling such powers as \"interdictionist\" does make sense to me, though they would still be placed firmly within the existing dichotomy.",

For example, Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine has absolutely upended the global order that existed before February 2022, with great power competition back at the forefront and countries the world over reevaluating their security arrangements (Sweden and Finland in NATO, Japan rearming, Japan-SK detente, new US security agreements in Pacific with Phillipines, etc).</p>\n\n<p>That being said, there is some value in denoting which revisionist powers actually have the capability to effect meaningful change to the global order (China, arguably Russia) from those that seek change but lack the power to actually do so (Iran, Venezuela? North Korea?). So labeling such powers as &quot;interdictionist&quot; does make sense to me, though they would still be placed firmly within the existing dichotomy.</p>\n</div>",

This frequency range limits the exchange of information to users within line-of-sight of one another, although with satellite capabilities and ad hoc protocols, it is nowadays possible to pass Link 16 data over long-haul protocols such as TCP/IP using MIL-STD 3011 (JREAP) or STANAG 5602 (SIMPLE).

I do sympathize with his desire to focus on optics, given that Ukraine is clearly very reliant on foreign aid, as you've pointed out yourself. However, I'm unsure as to how much this emphasis is going to increase the support for Ukrainian War Effort. I feel like everyone in the West who has even a sliver of respect for International Law and the basic idea that states should not constantly be terrified of being invaded by a bigger neighbor already do support Ukraine. I feel like the holdouts - people who sympathize with Putin for one reason or another, or are politicians that depend on the votes of such people - are highly unlikely to change their mind on this matter anyway. \n\nFurther, what's the point of aid if it is not being used as optimally as possible? For example, if I receive a bunch of new equipment and I use it to equip a battalion and then I tell it to hold an undefendable position until the very end because I don't want my allies to think I'm still losing ground, and the battalion ends up getting destroyed in the process, then didn't I just waste equipment that could've been used far more effectively? \n\nI also don't think that the support of the people who respect a rules-based world order depends as much on Ukraine's optics. If someone supports Ukraine because they're disgusted by Russian atrocities and find an unprovoked invasion to be unjustifiable, then I don't think Ukraine having to retreat from some place is going to change their opinion on the matter. \n\nAlso, if I'm the Head of Government of an allied nation and I am thinking about increasing or decreasing the aid I provide to Ukraine, if my experts were to tell me that a lot of Ukraine's manpower and equipment is being wasted on tactical situations where it shouldn't be, for optics, that would definitely not be strengthening the case for increasing support. \n\nI might be completely wrong about all of this, but that's what I think about it as a general observer.

These vessels had already been transferred, they were already commissioned by the Ukrainian navy and have been crewed by Ukrainians for more than a year now.  </p>\n\n<p>Either way the only real news here is the capability coalition, there&#39;s a lot of headlines flying around currently about the two vessels but that&#39;s pretty disingenuous on our part as they&#39;ve already been in the Ukrainian navy for <strong><em>nearly half a year...</em></strong></p>\n</div>",

More occupied territory means more expendable men, and expendable men are the resource Russia uses to occupy even more territory.
