        "body": "[Years of miscalculations by U.S., NATO led to dire shell shortage in Ukraine\n](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/ukraine-crisis-artillery/)\n\nA very interesting read, I will give the highlights but honestly the whole article is worth reading. The problems with production have clearly been a long time coming.\n\n> The causes of the shell crisis began years ago. They are rooted in decisions and miscalculations made by the U.S. military and its NATO allies that occurred well before Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion, a Reuters investigation found.\n\n> A decade of strategic, funding and production mistakes played a far greater role in the shell shortage than did the recent U.S. congressional delays of aid, Reuters found.\n\n> Production of the 155mm shell dropped so dramatically that, from summer 2014 to fall 2015, ***the U.S. added no new shells to its stockpile.***\n\n> Manufacturing defects and safety violations triggered repeated production-line shutdowns. The 2021 discovery of cracks in shells ***cut production capacity in half for months.***\n\n> A U.S. decision to change the type of explosive used in those shells hasn\u2019t helped the war effort and, to date, has been an expensive flop: The Army spent $147 million on a facility it doesn\u2019t use.\n\nThe facility mentioned above was built bespoke for processing waste involved in producing IMX-101 explosive precursors that are now imported from abroad with the explosive itself being switched back to TNT...\n\n> And a plan to replace an antiquated plant in Virginia that produced propellant to launch the shells has fallen a decade behind its scheduled completion and has almost doubled in price. That delay has created a greater U.S. reliance on raw materials from overseas than is publicly known. One internal U.S. Army document from 2021 details \u201cforeign dependencies\u201d on at least a dozen chemicals made in China and India, countries with close trade ties to Russia.\n\n> ***Particularly ironic: The U.S. pre-war plan for sourcing the explosive TNT from overseas included contracts with a factory in eastern Ukraine. The plant was seized by Russia early in the war.***\n\nCouldn't have just been Ukraine, but Eastern Ukraine. Should have just sourced from Russia itself. What's next, JP-8 from Bhutan?\n\n> In meetings in September, U.S. officials told the Ukrainians that \u201cwe have to move from the old era of military warfare to more technological things,\u201d Havrylov recalled.\n\n> Still, that advice was also necessitated by what some U.S. and NATO officials say was poor planning \u2013 a misguided belief that industry in the U.S. and Europe ***could quickly reverse more than three decades of funding cutbacks and plant closures,*** swing into action and mass-produce the needed ordnance.\n\n> \u201cPeople understood the risk and we took the risk because it was assumed industry could surge,\u201d said a former senior U.S. military official who participated in a 2023 Army review that documented failures to prepare for war. \u201cI don\u2019t think we understood collectively how challenged the industry would be to turn on a dime.\u201d\n\n> Without funding and upgrades, contractors told the Army that years-long backlogs and breakdowns at shell factories would only worsen. A confidential June 2021 briefing from contractor General Dynamics-OTS to an Army general noted that absent improvements, production of 155mm shells would fall by half by 2023. A bar chart in the same document showed that, at a key metal-making facility, ***83 pieces of equipment used to make the 155mm were more than 50 years old.*** General Dynamics, which makes shell casings, declined to comment.\n\nAt the end the ramp up to 100,000 shells a month is said to still be 18 long months away, the situation is still not looking good along with the [EU only producing 580,000 shells a year with not all of them being sent to Ukraine.](https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-weapons-shells-european-union-eu-war-russia-investigation/33025300.html)\n\n> According to a December 2023 Estonian Defense Ministry report, the EU production capacity is about 600,000 shells a year. This fits with German arms maker Rheinmetall's January 2024 estimate, an internal document that journalists obtained, which says that all Western European arms makers taken together could produce around 550,000 shells annually as of the beginning of this year.\n\n> In March 2023, the EU committed to sending Ukraine 1 million shells within a year. But it sent a little over 500,000 rounds, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry told Schemes in May. The European Commission confirmed this number to The Investigative Desk in June.\n\nThe Czech ammunition initiative is also struggling to get the necessary funding.\n\n> In February, President Petr Pavel said the Czech Republic had identified 800,000 artillery shells globally that could quickly be directed to Ukraine if there was money. But progress has been slow, and a high-ranking Ukrainian Defense Ministry source said the first shipment, which arrived in June, consisted of fewer than 50,000 shells.\n\n> A source familiar with the initiative told RFE/RL that out of 15 countries that volunteered to buy ammunition for Ukraine jointly, only six had chipped in as of mid-June, while the other nine said the money was coming.\n\n> \"So far, we have raised enough funds, including pledges that we are counting, for 500,000 [shells],\" Tomas Kopecny, the Czech governmental envoy for the reconstruction of Ukraine, told Investigace.CZ. \"It's a question of finance. The problem is not political leaning so much as lack of funding.\"\n\nAlso I just thought about this, how does the US expect to ramp up production to 100,000 shells a month in 18 months if TNT is such a bottleneck?\n\n> But both India and China also have tried to maintain good relations with Russia. And neither likely would be able to fill NATO\u2019s needs, even if willing. \u201cYou cannot imagine just how overheated the market is at the moment,\u201d said a European defense industry executive. \u201cThe worst thing at the moment is the global shortage of TNT and RDX. The shortage of these raw materials is the basic reason why production cannot be ramped up much more at this point.\u201d\n\nA new factory is being built for the shells themselves but the domestic TNT production is still 2 years away if all goes well.

The problems with production have clearly been a long time coming.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The causes of the shell crisis began years ago. They are rooted in decisions and miscalculations made by the U.S. military and its NATO allies that occurred well before Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion, a Reuters investigation found.</p>\n\n<p>A decade of strategic, funding and production mistakes played a far greater role in the shell shortage than did the recent U.S. congressional delays of aid, Reuters found.</p>\n\n<p>Production of the 155mm shell dropped so dramatically that, from summer 2014 to fall 2015, <strong><em>the U.S. added no new shells to its stockpile.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Manufacturing defects and safety violations triggered repeated production-line shutdowns. The 2021 discovery of cracks in shells <strong><em>cut production capacity in half for months.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>A U.S. decision to change the type of explosive used in those shells hasn\u2019t helped the war effort and, to date, has been an expensive flop: The Army spent $147 million on a facility it doesn\u2019t use.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The facility mentioned above was built bespoke for processing waste involved in producing IMX-101 explosive precursors that are now imported from abroad with the explosive itself being switched back to TNT...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>And a plan to replace an antiquated plant in Virginia that produced propellant to launch the shells has fallen a decade behind its scheduled completion and has almost doubled in price. That delay has created a greater U.S. reliance on raw materials from overseas than is publicly known. One internal U.S. Army document from 2021 details \u201cforeign dependencies\u201d on at least a dozen chemicals made in China and India, countries with close trade ties to Russia.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Particularly ironic: The U.S. pre-war plan for sourcing the explosive TNT from overseas included contracts with a factory in eastern Ukraine. The plant was seized by Russia early in the war.</em></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Couldn&#39;t have just been Ukraine, but Eastern Ukraine. Should have just sourced from Russia itself. What&#39;s next, JP-8 from Bhutan?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In meetings in September, U.S. officials told the Ukrainians that \u201cwe have to move from the old era of military warfare to more technological things,\u201d Havrylov recalled.</p>\n\n<p>Still, that advice was also necessitated by what some U.S. and NATO officials say was poor planning \u2013 a misguided belief that industry in the U.S. and Europe <strong><em>could quickly reverse more than three decades of funding cutbacks and plant closures,</em></strong> swing into action and mass-produce the needed ordnance.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cPeople understood the risk and we took the risk because it was assumed industry could surge,\u201d said a former senior U.S. military official who participated in a 2023 Army review that documented failures to prepare for war. \u201cI don\u2019t think we understood collectively how challenged the industry would be to turn on a dime.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Without funding and upgrades, contractors told the Army that years-long backlogs and breakdowns at shell factories would only worsen. A confidential June 2021 briefing from contractor General Dynamics-OTS to an Army general noted that absent improvements, production of 155mm shells would fall by half by 2023. A bar chart in the same document showed that, at a key metal-making facility, <strong><em>83 pieces of equipment used to make the 155mm were more than 50 years old.</em></strong> General Dynamics, which makes shell casings, declined to comment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At the end the ramp up to 100,000 shells a month is said to still be 18 long months away, the situation is still not looking good along with the <a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-weapons-shells-european-union-eu-war-russia-investigation/33025300.html\">EU only producing 580,000 shells a year with not all of them being sent to Ukraine.</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>According to a December 2023 Estonian Defense Ministry report, the EU production capacity is about 600,000 shells a year. This fits with German arms maker Rheinmetall&#39;s January 2024 estimate, an internal document that journalists obtained, which says that all Western European arms makers taken together could produce around 550,000 shells annually as of the beginning of this year.</p>\n\n<p>In March 2023, the EU committed to sending Ukraine 1 million shells within a year. But it sent a little over 500,000 rounds, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry told Schemes in May. The European Commission confirmed this number to The Investigative Desk in June.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Czech ammunition initiative is also struggling to get the necessary funding.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In February, President Petr Pavel said the Czech Republic had identified 800,000 artillery shells globally that could quickly be directed to Ukraine if there was money. But progress has been slow, and a high-ranking Ukrainian Defense Ministry source said the first shipment, which arrived in June, consisted of fewer than 50,000 shells.</p>\n\n<p>A source familiar with the initiative told RFE/RL that out of 15 countries that volunteered to buy ammunition for Ukraine jointly, only six had chipped in as of mid-June, while the other nine said the money was coming.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;So far, we have raised enough funds, including pledges that we are counting, for 500,000 [shells],&quot; Tomas Kopecny, the Czech governmental envoy for the reconstruction of Ukraine, told Investigace.CZ. &quot;It&#39;s a question of finance. The problem is not political leaning so much as lack of funding.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Also I just thought about this, how does the US expect to ramp up production to 100,000 shells a month in 18 months if TNT is such a bottleneck?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>But both India and China also have tried to maintain good relations with Russia. And neither likely would be able to fill NATO\u2019s needs, even if willing. \u201cYou cannot imagine just how overheated the market is at the moment,\u201d said a European defense industry executive. \u201cThe worst thing at the moment is the global shortage of TNT and RDX. The shortage of these raw materials is the basic reason why production cannot be ramped up much more at this point.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A new factory is being built for the shells themselves but the domestic TNT production is still 2 years away if all goes well. The only TNT plant mentioned is in Poland and only produces 10,000 tons a year so enough for a million shells if all is used for American shell production which is obviously not the case.</p>\n</div>",

Have the underlying issues that caused it been fixed? It doesn't sound like it.\n\n> so youre saying they shouldnt have been getting tnt from there at all? \n\nNo... I am saying if you are carrying out defence planning, and you have only two factories on record that can produce the necessary good and one is on the border of your rival. You cannot qualify that facility as a backup. In fact alarm bells should be blasting in your head and a new domestic facility should be not only planned but fast tracked because that is completely unacceptable!\n\n>there is a global shortage doesnt mean they cant keep supplying what they can and have been does it\n\nYes and the amount supplied has been paltry, 1,200 tons is not a lot compared to 10,000 and the amount was sent to \"arms makers that supply Western forces\". TNT is not just used for artillery.\n\n>russian shells are of far lower quality \n\nSource?\n\n> barrel artillery is of far lower quality\n\nSource?\n\n> there are others but finland for example wants to build a tnt plant that can be completed in 1 to 2 years\n\nFair but again in one or two years...\n\n> and the plant in texas is now open. where they are getting the materials for that idk but they are clearly up and running with what plans they do have and they will be producing 72,000 shells by june of next year\n\n> Factories in Scranton and Wilkes-Barre, Pa., together make about 36,000 shells per month. The new General Dynamics facility in Mesquite, Texas, will make 30,000 each month once it reaches its full capacity.\n\nSo 66k at full capacity possibly not yet reached.\n\n> Once complete, the empty shells made in Mesquite will be shipped to the Army\u2019s sole facility for filling them with explosives \u2014 a World War II-era plant in Burlington, Iowa.

Have the underlying issues that caused it been fixed? It doesn&#39;t sound like it.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>so youre saying they shouldnt have been getting tnt from there at all? </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>No... I am saying if you are carrying out defence planning, and you have only two factories on record that can produce the necessary good and one is on the border of your rival. You cannot qualify that facility as a backup. In fact alarm bells should be blasting in your head and a new domestic facility should be not only planned but fast tracked because that is completely unacceptable!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>there is a global shortage doesnt mean they cant keep supplying what they can and have been does it</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes and the amount supplied has been paltry, 1,200 tons is not a lot compared to 10,000 and the amount was sent to &quot;arms makers that supply Western forces&quot;. TNT is not just used for artillery.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>russian shells are of far lower quality </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Source?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>barrel artillery is of far lower quality</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Source?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>there are others but finland for example wants to build a tnt plant that can be completed in 1 to 2 years</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Fair but again in one or two years...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>and the plant in texas is now open. where they are getting the materials for that idk but they are clearly up and running with what plans they do have and they will be producing 72,000 shells by june of next year</p>\n\n<p>Factories in Scranton and Wilkes-Barre, Pa., together make about 36,000 shells per month. The new General Dynamics facility in Mesquite, Texas, will make 30,000 each month once it reaches its full capacity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So 66k at full capacity possibly not yet reached.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Once complete, the empty shells made in Mesquite will be shipped to the Army\u2019s sole facility for filling them with explosives \u2014 a World War II-era plant in Burlington, Iowa.

We've also heard from Ukraine that the training we provided was to some degree irrelevant / outdated and/or lacking (e.g. no use of / defense against drones).  Given the lack of near-peer combat experience in European armies, wouldn't it be a good idea to equip and send volunteers to fight in Ukraine?  These foreign volunteers could then either fight along the Ukrainians or operate in e.g. their own tank platoon, much like a NATO unit would as part of a larger whole.  \n\n\nI've heard Zelensky say previously that they need equipment more than manpower, but the idea here would be that these units would bring their own equipment to \"practice\" with.  If defense is needed at home, they would then pack up their gear and leave.  \n  \nIf the holdup is that we have zero tolerance for losses in such units, I think Ukraine would be very happy to get e.g. visiting fighter pilots that \"trained\" on cruise missile interception, far away from Russian GBAD,.  Maintenance crews getting some real-world experience in keeping aircraft in the air, would probably also be most welcome.  Hell, even sending people to \"practice\" logistics would probably free up Ukrainians for other duties, right?\n\nPersonally, I believe the tolerance for such losses would be quite high, as long as they are volunteers.  It seems to me that most of the negative reactions happen went 1) the war itself is under critique 2) the soldiers signed up for the military but not that particular war.  It's hard to say anything but \"heroic\" when someone volunteers to fight and then dies for a cause they themselves believe in.",

Given the lack of near-peer combat experience in European armies, wouldn&#39;t it be a good idea to equip and send volunteers to fight in Ukraine?  These foreign volunteers could then either fight along the Ukrainians or operate in e.g. their own tank platoon, much like a NATO unit would as part of a larger whole.  </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve heard Zelensky say previously that they need equipment more than manpower, but the idea here would be that these units would bring their own equipment to &quot;practice&quot; with.  If defense is needed at home, they would then pack up their gear and leave.  </p>\n\n<p>If the holdup is that we have zero tolerance for losses in such units, I think Ukraine would be very happy to get e.g. visiting fighter pilots that &quot;trained&quot; on cruise missile interception, far away from Russian GBAD,.  Maintenance crews getting some real-world experience in keeping aircraft in the air, would probably also be most welcome.  Hell, even sending people to &quot;practice&quot; logistics would probably free up Ukrainians for other duties, right?</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I believe the tolerance for such losses would be quite high, as long as they are volunteers.  It seems to me that most of the negative reactions happen went 1) the war itself is under critique 2) the soldiers signed up for the military but not that particular war.  It&#39;s hard to say anything but &quot;heroic&quot; when someone volunteers to fight and then dies for a cause they themselves believe in.</p>\n</div>",
