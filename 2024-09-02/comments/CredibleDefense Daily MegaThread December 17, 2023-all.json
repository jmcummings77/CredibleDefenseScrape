I'm hearing lots of contradictory rumours with very little substantiation. \n\nThe biggest question mark is the Brotherhood position, and it should be noted that each of the ethnic groups has their own particular set of priorities. The MNDAA has secured most of what they want (Kokang), the TLNA is pretty close to getting what they want (Muse), and the AA's objectives are divided between eastern (Shan) and western (Rakhine) provinces. The groups are apparently talking between themselves to figure out a unified position, be it for negotiation or continued fighting. My best guess is that they will officially reject any ceasefire, but unofficially dial down their operations to small skirmishes instead of concerted offensives. They've already secured most of their \"home\" territory, and controlling unfamiliar ground with unfriendly locals is a tough sell (as the Tatmadaw discovered the hard way). \n\nOf course, there are also plenty of other factors in play, and all of them also have question marks around them. Chinese influence is a big one, but Beijing has been very tight-lipped (even moreso than usual) and so all we have to work with is sketchy rumours. There are ongoing talks between China and the Brotherhood, and allegedly the former told the latter to get their shit together w.r.t. a unified position. There are also ongoing talks between China and the junta, and allegedly the latter is offering all sorts of concessions to the former to keep the Brotherhood on a short leash. However, exactly how much of a leash China is working with is difficult to ascertain; while the Brotherood enjoys some limited amount of Chinese support, they have always been held at arms' length and viewed as loose cannons. Beijing's real attack dogs in Myanmar are the UWSA, who are far better equipped and have sat out the conflict thus far. The Brotherhood has a convergence of interests with China, plus historical links, but their interests and actions have diverged before. That's not to say China doesn't have any leverage (they have a lot), but it's not just a matter of Beijing saying jump. \n\nAnother open question is the other non-Brotherhood resistance groups, including other ethnic armies, PDFs, NUG, and so on. There is a lot of talking happening behind the scenes, with everyone trying to figure out what's going on and influence the outcome to serve their own interests. The Wa of the aforementioned UWSA, for instance, have the strongest ethnic army by far, but have done very little aside from quietly selling equipment. Up north there is the Kachin KIA with deep ties to the Brotherhood, while down south there's the Karen groups. Those groups, the KNDF and KNLA, in turn have close connections to the PDFs and NUG. So do the Chin (not Chinese) groups further west, like the CDF and CNDF. And now we've more or less made it all the way to Rakhine on the coast, where the other half of the AA (of the Brotherhood) is fighting. The whole thing is a very tangled web, and how exactly everything is linked together is hard to know with any certainty. \n\nLong story short is that there is a lot of attention on the Brotherhood right now, because their involvement has been a major catalyst for resistance gains. If they decide to scale back their operations, or halt them altogether, that would be a big blow to other groups elsewhere. But they are by no means the only players in this game.",

And remember the interceptor only has to knock the drone out of the sky, while the attack drone needs a payload sufficient to damage its target, which can be substantial for an armored vehicle let alone a concrete building. Payload size drives every other significant cost of a drone other than guidance, particularly propulsion.</p>\n\n<p>And remember that ultimately what matters is the value of the target defended.</p>\n\n<p>RTS style cost exchange isn&#39;t a great way to understand real world conflicts.</p>\n</div>",

They just don&#39;t approve of the American approach to it. That&#39;s a different story.   </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Similarly, many late-stage communist regimes in Eastern Europe veered significantly towards nationalism (Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, but also to some degree Hungary or Poland).

Look at people like former and perhaps soon to be Polish PM Donald Tusk, former Romanian president Traian Basescu or former Czech president Vaclav Havel. Heck, look at the allegedly (and incorrectly labeled) far right PiS party from Poland or any of the Baltic politicians. Countries in the former Yugoslavia, especially Serbia are a different matter due to the NATO interventions there in the 1990s.</p>\n</div>",

I haven't counted them but... a lot, I guess?\n\n> Polls asking opinions about other countries are in no way a proxy for trading with that country. You can dislike a country for political or historical reasons or dissapprove of its political regime but still want to trade with that country if it's a win-win trade.\n\nThey're not the best indication, I agree, but I can't think of a better one that's also conclusively polled. They're not useless though. Approval is significantly influenced by all sorts of factors that correlate with trade approval, such as social issues that international relations introduces (this was a big thing when it came to trade with Russia, just ask anyone who worked in a national oil and gas industry). More generally, it also tends to correlate fairly well with how willing people are to think trade with it is a win-win.\n\n> Melenchon is far left. He's literally member of a Communist party.

A lot of them did not like or approve of Putin, with the exception of the German social democrats. \n\nSure, but his is currently the largest left-leaning group in the French parliament and, consequently, the most influential one in national politics. Not that he's the only Russian sympathiser in the French left, either.\n\nI didn't claim *all* factions in the European left do that. What I did mention is that even after the major fracture that the Prague spring did, *some* factions still have either strong ties with, or a general sympathy towards, Russia. Like Melenchon's NUP\u00c9S, which is not a fringe party at all.\n\nYes, there's obviously a plurality of factions in left-wing politics. Those aren't \"the leftists\" any more than these ones.\n\n> Except the latest batch of some(by no means all) of the ultranationalist parties, the mainstream right in the formerly communist countries in Europe was very much anti Russia. Look at people like former and perhaps soon to be Polish PM Donald Tusk, former Romanian president Traian Basescu or former Czech president Vaclav Havel\n\nThat's certainly true, although other than Traian Basescu, I'm not sure the politicians you've mentioned belong on the hawkish list - or rather I don't know if they'd be seen as hawkish in their respective countries. (Edit:) Maybe Havel, although his tenure was far less hawkish than his disidence - I know he's been described as such by Western media but standards of hawkishness are pretty fluid :-). But, yeah, that's certainly true, throughout the '90s and early '00s, the mainstream right in most European countries was generally on poor terms with Russia.\n\nHowever, as in the previous case, there is (and always has been) a plurality of opinions on this topic on the right side of the isle, and some of the ultranationalist parties are very much part of the mainstream right - both in Western countries (e.g. France, where the FN isn't exactly a fringe party anymore) and in Eastern countries (e.g. the aforementioned Romania where a far-right party is polling around the same levels as centre-right liberal parties).\n\nThese are part of the \"European right\" just as much as the other ones, and while they are a \"recent batch\" in terms of general denomination, they're not entirely new people. If you look at Romania's AUR, probably the up-and-coming-est of them all, you'll find a bunch of people who were involved in politics in the early 00s, the nineties, and even the 1980s, all of whom had various degrees of public exposure throughout this time - not enough to make it in international media, but enough to be of some local notoriety and to be involved in mainstream politics. Much of their current status was built not through \"conversions\" from other parties, but by responding to previously unrepresented or disenfranchised voters - people with right-leaning sympathies that right-leaning parties had ignored. (It also helps that their political marketing is really good; my Romanian isn't great but even I can register it as unambiguously mobilising)",

        "body": "[An interesting analysis](https://internationalepolitik.de/de/russland-gewinnt-den-krieg-sicher) from InternationalPolitik, a publication by the German Council on Foreign Relations. Posting the English translation below. I suspect most will be familiar, but the comments on German commitment surprised me.\n\n> Vladimir Putin and his faithful should take note of the current press response in Germany and other NATO countries with benevolence. \"Russia wins the war of aggression\" can be read because in the current position war in eastern Ukraine, the time is working for Moscow.\n\n> Russia has the larger reserves and can throw almost unlimited people and material to the front - the defeat of Ukraine is therefore inevitable sooner or later. The phalanx of the Western supporters of Ukraine will crumble, as other crises, such as the fighting between Israelis and Palestinians, overlay the war in Eastern Europe. The everyday worries of people in Germany, from rising prices to growing migration pressure, would also lead to growing Ukraine fatigue. The USA, still Ukraine's strongest supporter, would significantly cut its aid under pressure from the Republicans, and if Donald Trump were re-elected president next November, then everything would be over anyway.\n\n> Apart from the fact that it is not even defined what exactly is meant by a Russian \"victory\" or a Ukrainian defeat, considerable doubts about such a downfall scenario are appropriate.\n\n> *Russia's position remains difficult*\n\n> First of all, you should remember that it is on the 24th. In February 2022, it was considered almost certain that Ukraine would only be able to withstand the Russian attack for a few days or weeks. This was not even implausible, because the small Ukrainian defense power was faced by the supposedly huge Russian forces, which saw themselves in the tradition of the glorious Red Army. The idea that a year later one would even envisage a possible \"victory\" of Ukraine would have been dismissed as a phantasy at the time.\n\n> Even today, Russia is in a position that is anything but comfortable. In nine years of war against Ukraine, the Russian armed forces have occupied just 19 percent of Ukrainian territory. The blood toll paid is unimaginable. A few days ago, the American secret service published estimates of 315,000 victims on the Russian side, which is almost 90 percent of the 360,000-strong invasion army with which Russia had started the attack. Other estimates, which infer from the (known) payments of the Russian government to victim families on the number of dead and injured, come to even higher figures.\n\n> Further waves of mobilization are likely to become extremely difficult, not to mention the consequences for the motivation of the armed forces. The loss of soldiers and material, the American report continues, would militarily throw Russia back by 18 years. Nor has Russia been able to intercept a single train or convoy that bring Western aid via Poland to Ukraine. The Black Sea Fleet has had to withdraw a large part of its ships from Sevastopol and move further east, because only a few British Storm Shadow cruise missiles pose a significant danger. The ammunition supplied by North Korea is said to bring with it considerable safety problems and can hardly be used. Other sanctions packages of the European Union or the USA plug loopholes through which Russia had purchased modern technology.\n\n> *Huge costs*\n\n> The cost of the war is also enormous for Russia and will devour 40 percent of total government spending next year. Gazprom, whose profits once accounted for ten percent of the state budget, has lost 80 percent of its markets in Western Europe without being able to compensate for this with deliveries to India or China - the pipelines are simply missing. Having to supply oil to India at the price of 70 dollars per barrel is also not a gold mine. With NATO, you are also faced with an alliance whose gross domestic product is about twenty times higher than that of Russia - not to mention the other supporters of Ukraine within the framework of the G-7.\n\n> But, it is said, Russia is capable of suffering and can sit out its own needs until Western support for Ukraine dwindles. However, it doesn't look like it so far either. The members of the European Union have just decided to start accession talks with Ukraine and thus offer the country anchoring in the West - something that Putin absolutely wanted to prevent. A new aid package for Ukraine will be decided sooner or later despite the current resistance of Hungary, and even if at some point the EU's commitment as a whole should sitake, countries such as Poland, Finland, Sweden or the Baltic States will always support Ukraine.\n\n> *Unbroken solidarity*\n\n> It is also noteworthy that Germany has largely excluded the defense budget and Ukraine aid in the recent budget cuts that have become necessary and instead saves on social and climate protection expenditure - under a social democratic chancellor and a green minister of economic affairs. Surveys show that this prioritization even finds a clear majority in the public.\n\n> But what about the growing unwillingness of the US Republicans to continue to provide money for Ukraine - hasn't President Zelensky left Washington again without any work done? Here, too, it is worth taking a closer look. The majority of Republicans in Congress are not against the support of Ukraine, but above all against President Joe Biden, who does not want to be successful.\n\n> The actual domestic political debate revolves around means for securing the American southern border against migrants - a discussion that the Republicans absolutely have, but the Democrats want to avoid. The Ukraine aid is the plaything in this fierce conflict. If both parties succeed in jumping over their shadows despite the deep social division, aid for Ukraine can also continue to flow. On the 13th and 14th In December, the Senate and House of Representatives, with a large majority of both parties, launched a compromise decision that allows aid to Ukraine for two more years, provided that President Biden makes concessions to Border Security. Resistance to the decision only came from the ranks of the Republican isolationists.\n\n> And if Trump wins and on the 20th January 2025 as a new president? Then everything is different anyway, not only in terms of Ukraine, but also with regard to transatlantic relations or the future of NATO. But firstly, this is not guaranteed and secondly, it will be 13 months until then - a time that can be very long for Putin in view of the problems described.\n\n> Does all this mean that, conversely, the success of Ukraine is assured? By no means, even there the losses are enormous, and without the great international support, the country could never have withstood the pressure of Russia for so long. It is up to Ukraine to decide how long it can and wants to make its own sacrifices and whether it understands by \"victory\" the reconquest of its entire national territory or some form of compromise. Until then, further Western aid for Ukraine is absolutely necessary in terms of security policy, military and also morally. Every rhetoric \u00e0 la \"Russia wins anyway\" undermines the international solidarity through which Ukraine has so far been able to survive.\n\nI was not aware that the SPD was cutting its domestic priorities and preserving aid to Ukraine. That would seem to be a turnabout from Germany\u2019s earlier investment in the war effort.",

Geolocated footage published on December 17 indicates that Ukrainian forces recently advanced in northern Synkivka.[60]\n\n**Russian Subordinate Main Effort #2 \u2013 Donetsk Oblast (Russian objective: Capture the entirety of Donetsk Oblast, the claimed territory of Russia\u2019s proxies in Donbas)**\n\n> Russian forces reportedly conducted offensive operations north of Bakhmut on December 17 but did not make any claimed advances. \n\n> The Russian MoD claimed that Ukrainian forces unsuccessfully attacked near Bakhmut near Ivanivske (6km west of Bakhmut), Klishchiivka (7km southwest of Bakhmut), and Pivnichne (21km southwest of Bakhmut) on December 17.[64]\n\n> Russian forces conducted offensive operations near Bakhmut and made confirmed advances on December 17. Geolocated footage published on December 17 indicates that Russian forces advanced northwest of Khromove (immediately west of Bakhmut).[65] \n\n> Russian forces continued offensive operations near Avdiivka on December 17 and recently made confirmed advances. Geolocated footage published on December 17 indicates that Russian forces made marginal gains near Stepove (3km north of Avdiivka).[72] \n\n> Ukrainian forces counterattacked near Avdiivka on December 17 and recently advanced. Geolocated footage published on December 17 indicates that Ukrainian forces advanced east of Nevelske.[78] \n\n> Russian sources claimed that Russian forces captured Marinka and continued offensive operations west and southwest of Donetsk City on December 17. Russian milbloggers claimed that Russian forces completely control all of Marinka and are currently clearing the outskirts of the settlement.[80]\n\n> The Russian MoD claimed that Ukrainian forces unsuccessfully attacked west and southwest of Donetsk City near Marinka and Pobieda on December 17.[84]\n\n**Russian Supporting Effort \u2013 Southern Axis (Russian objective: Maintain frontline positions and secure rear areas against Ukrainian strikes)**\n\n> Russian and Ukrainian forces continued positional combat engagements on the Donetsk-Zaporizhia Oblast border on December 17.[85]\n\n> Ukrainian forces continued offensive operations in western Zaporizhia Oblast but likely did not advance on December 17. ISW observed geolocated footage published on December 15 that indicated that Ukrainian forces made marginal advances west of Verbove (9km west of Robotyne) sometime in December 2023.[89] \n\n> Russian forces continued to counterattack in western Zaporizhia Oblast on December 17 and have reportedly made some advances, although ISW did not observe evidence indicating a Russian advance. \n\n> Ukrainian forces maintain positions in the east (left) bank of Kherson Oblast. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces maintain positions in the east bank of Kherson Oblast.[95] A Russian milblogger claimed that Ukrainian forces continue to deploy reinforcements to the east bank of the Dnipro River.[96] \n\n---\n\n**Russian Mobilization and Force Generation Efforts (Russian objective: Expand combat power without conducting general mobilization)**\n\n> Relatives of Russian mobilized personnel continue to appeal directly to high-ranking Russian military and political officials about demobilization and the return of their relatives from Ukraine. Russian opposition outlet Mobilization News reported on December 17 that wives of mobilized personnel sent a collective appeal for their husbands to return home to Russian Chief of the General Staff Army General Valery Gerasimov, Russian Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu, and Russian Security Council Deputy Chairperson Dmitry Medvedev.[100]\n\n**Russian Technological Adaptations (Russian objective: Introduce technological innovations to optimize systems for use in Ukraine)**\n\n> Business Insider reported on December 16 that Russian forces are adding protective screens to trenches in Ukraine, likely in order to conceal troop movements from Ukrainian strike and reconnaissance drones.[101]\n\n**Activities in Russian-occupied areas (Russian objective: Consolidate administrative control of annexed areas; forcibly integrate Ukrainian citizens into Russian sociocultural, economic, military, and governance systems)**\n\n> The Kremlin continues attempts to expand political infrastructure in occupied Ukraine in an effort to further integrate occupied territories into Russia. Russian Security Council Deputy Chairperson Dmitry Medvedev claimed on December 17 that 160,000 people joined the Kremlin-backed United Russia party in occupied Ukraine.[102]\n\n> The Ukrainian Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) reported that Russian officials are increasing pressure on Ukrainian employees of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) to sign contracts with Russian nuclear operator Rosatom and receive Russian passports by December 31.[103]\n\n**Russian Information Operations and Narratives**\n\n> The Ukrainian Center for Countering Disinformation stated on December 17 that Russian intelligence services created fake Telegram channels posing as Ukrainian brigades and battalions to promote information about alleged Ukrainian military command violations and attempt to discredit the Ukrainian military.[104]\n\n> The Kremlin is likely orchestrating a coordinated narrative about Putin\u2019s role in transforming Russia since 2000 ahead of the March 2024 presidential elections. Sevastopol occupation governor Mikhail Razvozhaev, Kherson Oblast occupation head Vladimir Saldo, and Luhansk People\u2019s Republic (LNR) Head Leonid Pasechnik participated in the United Russia party congress in Moscow on December 17 that unanimously supported Putin\u2019s nomination and amplified narratives about how Russia has changed since the early 2000s under Putin\u2019s leadership.[105] Razvozhev\u2019s, Saldo\u2019s, and Pasechnik\u2019s narratives largely mirrored Putin\u2019s rhetoric in his interview with Rossiya 1 on December 17.\n\n**Significant activity in Belarus (Russian efforts to increase its military presence in Belarus and further integrate Belarus into Russian-favorable frameworks and Wagner Group activity in Belarus)**\n\n> Ukrainian military observer Kostyantyn Mashovets stated on December 17 that the Belarusian military deployed an air assault battalion of the 38th Air Assault Brigade near Uzhovo and south of Pinsk in Brest Oblast; two detachments from the 5th Spetsnaz Brigade near Ivanava, Brest Oblast and Pribolovichi, Gomel Oblast; a parachute battalion of the 103rd Airborne Brigade near Lyelchytsy District, Brahim, and Zyabrovka, Gomel Oblast; a tactical group of the 51st Artillery Brigade south of Gomel City; and a rocket artillery battery of the 336th Rocket Artillery Brigade near Zyabrovka, Gomel Oblast.[106] Mashovets stated that this group includes 1,840 military personnel, up to 68-70 armored fighting vehicles, 24 artillery systems, and three air defense systems.",

Kherson Oblast occupation administration head Vladimir Saldo stated in an interview with Russian state outlet RIA Novosti on December 16 that any future peace negotiations with Ukraine will be on Russia\u2019s terms, which include \u201ccomplete capitulation of Ukraine, the demilitarization of Ukraine, and the return of all original Russian territories and their inhabitants who want to return to Russia.\u201d[94] Saldo\u2019s statement is another confirmation of ISW\u2019s assessment that Russia does not intend to engage in good faith peace negotiations with Ukraine.[95]</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

It's actually a remarkably old question. The earliest work I know on this topic is from the 1970s, a paper called *The Status of Combatants and the Question of Guerilla Warfare* by G. Draper. A good modern work is probably Dinstein's *The Conduct of Hostilities under the Law of International Armed Conflict*, although many (most?) recent takes tend to come from the civilian protection angle.\n\nI'm not away of places that try to ELI5/12 these things though, in part because this is a far more complicated topic than the mere existence of some laws would imply. If you browse through Michael Bothe & al.'s commentary on the two 1977 protocols additional to the Geneva Conventions, which I think is easily and freely available online, you'll see what I mean. It's not just that there's a lot of nuance in the original Conventions, it's also that there's very little uniform precedent to go on and enforcement, if and when it happens, is often delayed to the point where it impairs the establishment of precedent in the first place.\n\nTo answer some of your questions (briefly): civilian status is based on what people do, not on where they are or what papers they have. Someone acting as a spotter or involved in managing military logistics would generally be considered a legitimate target, whether they're armed or not. Civilians who refuse to evacuate a conflict area, or are forced to stay, are generally not legitimate targets and there is an imperative to protect them. But these are both super general.
