        "body": "Some quick reflections on \u2018tactical\u2019 nuclear weapons and the Ukraine conflict.\n\nIt\u2019s been mooted a few times that Putin might resort specifically to using small-yield nuclear weapons on the battlefield to erode Ukraine\u2019s advantage.\n\nHowever, this isn\u2019t as simple as it sounds. Most people are going to overestimate the efficacy of tactical nukes against armoured formations. No-one knows for sure, of course, but there was a lot of analysis done in the Cold War when it was assumed that NATO would need to use tactical weapons to blunt any Soviet invasion of Western Europe.\n\nIn short, there are two big problems with using small-yield bombs in a battlefield capacity. The first is that most armoured units aren't conveniently bunched up in very tight proximity like buildings in cities, so the same kind of bomb that would devastate an urban area might only knock out a dozen tanks. The second is that armoured vehicles are very good at surviving heat and blast effects - one Cold War study found that tanks require approximately 45 psi of overpressure to be reliably rendered inoperable. The 10kT warheads on Russia's SSC-8 create a fireball approximately 400m in diameter (probably fatal to tanks in the affected area), but once you get half a click away, overpressure has already dropped to 20 psi.\n\nOn top of these inherent limitations to battlefield use of small yield nuclear armaments, it's also worth remembering that the battlefield situation in Ukraine is VERY different from that which NATO was facing in 1970. Back then, NATO expected to be dealing with massed armoured columns attacking in accordance with Soviet Deep Battle Doctrine. The topography of Germany means that the majority of these would be funneled through a few relatively narrow corridors, most famously the Fulda Gap, thus creating favourable conditions for the use of battlefield nukes. Additionally, even if tank columns survived the nukes themselves, the expectation was that the roads, bridges, and infrastructure near the blast would be damaged so as to slow the progress of subsequent reinforcing units.\n\nAll of this is very different from Ukraine, where the actual number of troops and armoured vehicles involved have been comparatively small, and largely dispersed across a massive front.\n\nUltimately, the best way way to use small-yield nuclear weapons to obtain results on the battlefield is to use them to systematically knock out an opposing force's command and control and logistics capacities within the theatre of operations by targeting communications, bridges, airfields, power supplies, etc., essentially doing with nukes what America did to Iraq with precision bombs in Desert Storm. However, this kind of effort is unlikely to be effective in piecemeal form; in order to permanently degrade Ukraine's ability to wage war in a given theatre of operations, Russia would  need to be looking at the use of multiple bombs, perhaps more than a dozen. And since many of the relevant targets would be located in or close to built-up civilian areas, casualties among the civilian population would be high (the human body, unlike tanks, doesn't tend to do well with 20 psi of overpressure).\n\nAll of which is to say that a handful of small-yield nuclear bombs used exclusively against military targets or on battlefields is unlikely to create sustained military advantage for Russia, while incurring significant diplomatic penalty. In order to be decisive even within a theatre of operations such as the Kharkiv front, Russia would need to use multiple weapons and target military infrastructure and supporting civilian infrastructure, with attendant massive diplomatic costs. If they adopted this second strategy, they could almost certainly obtain a decisive military advantage in the short-term, but the cost would be complete international opprobrium and the breaking of the nuclear taboo (this latter ultimately being advantageous for Russia as one of the five official nuclear powers). Moreover, it is likely that there would be overwhelming political pressure at that point for the United States to intervene at least conventionally in the conflict, significantly raising the risks of escalation to general (nuclear) war between Russia and the United States.\n\nThere are no easy \u201cbattlefield nuke\u201d options for Russia.",

Just the invasion itself, or the specifics?\n\nI think [this](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/02/ukraine-crisis-putin-military-opposition.html) Russian ex-military colonel was very on the mark with most of his stuff.\n\nNote the date, sure he was in the military and actually held a pretty important position; but that was long ago for him; his predictions are also pretty good. If Putin was actually surrounded by people like him I doubt he'd invade.\n\n>Khodarenok derides the notion, held by many senior political officials in Moscow, that Russia could conquer Ukraine in short order. This view, he writes, reflects \u201ccomplete ignorance of the military-political situation and the mood of the broad masses\u201d in Ukraine.

Gather rapid strike forces to pummel those new units--hope for a breakthrough but plan to just keep them pinned and worth less than allowing them to entrench along the line.\n\n2) Use long range strikes to keep mucking up Russian infrastructure. Gathering this offensive force will take many trains and trucks. By keeping the pressure on, it may be possible to forestall the offensive entirely.\n\n3) Build a defense in depth where Russia plans their winter offensive. Build a counter-offensive force that can strike once the Russian's offensive withers down, to encircle the advancing force at best but to keep them otherwise on unfavorable grounds for early spring to early summer.\n\nOf course, war is fluid.

There is no guarantee that they will not change again;</p>\n\n<p>5) The plywood marshal, those in charge of the military-industrial complex, and the Rostekh leadership are in their places, having failed in their mission.</p>\n\n<p>6) Mobilization is ineffective without reformatting the Russian army into the army of the 21st century: with UAVs, communications, high-precision weapons, military satellites, with delegating the right to determine and solve combat tasks to junior commanders;</p>\n\n<p>7) And this strange circus will continue until the Russians in Russia have at least the smallest subjectivity with which to explain to them the reasons for the recent rendition of &quot;NATO mercenaries&quot; and Ukrainian nationalists.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Why do you assume that translation is the problem? And why do you sound so confident about this incorrect prognosis?\n\nI cannot speak for China, but as for the Kim regime, their press releases are translated very accurately - i.e., yes, they really do sound that bad, even in original Korean. \"The US should keep its mouth shut\" is an extremely faithful translation of the original wording, \"\ubbf8\uad6d\uc740 \uc785\uc744 \ub2e4\ubb3c\uc5b4\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4\".\n\nTheir diplomatic pronouncements over the past few years are actually a vast improvement from the Kim Jung-il years (c. 1990s to 2011). Their rhetoric back then was really, really bad. Not a month went by without threatening to level Seoul in a sea of fire and smoke, or something like that.\n\nThe Kim regime didn't gain its buffoonish reputation for nothing. This is a government that threw professionalism to the dogs from the beginning. Their founder, Kim Il-sung, had a notable disdain of book learning and intellectuals.",

And why do you sound so confident about this incorrect prognosis?</p>\n\n<p>I cannot speak for China, but as for the Kim regime, their press releases are translated very accurately - i.e., yes, they really do sound that bad, even in original Korean. &quot;The US should keep its mouth shut&quot; is an extremely faithful translation of the original wording, &quot;\ubbf8\uad6d\uc740 \uc785\uc744 \ub2e4\ubb3c\uc5b4\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Their diplomatic pronouncements over the past few years are actually a vast improvement from the Kim Jung-il years (c. 1990s to 2011). Their rhetoric back then was really, really bad. Not a month went by without threatening to level Seoul in a sea of fire and smoke, or something like that.</p>\n\n<p>The Kim regime didn&#39;t gain its buffoonish reputation for nothing.

There are various ways that this could play out on a tactical or strategic level.\n\nThe test is whether partial mobilization can succeed on a diplomatic level, which is to say whether Russia can force a favorable geopolitical settlement. Right now the reason Russia cannot force a favorable settlement is because of the Russian time horizon. It is abundantly clear that Ukraine can trade space for time long enough to outlast Russia's ability and will to wage war. So the question here really is: does partial mobilization extend Russia's ability to wage this war long enough that Kyiv might balk at their certainty of outlasting Russia's war. \n\nI really don't think it does. The drafting of 300k new soldiers would prevent Russia's manpower problems from becoming critical (assuming Russia doesn't screw up mobilization like they have screwed up elsewhere). But partial mobilization does nothing to address other problems that are critical for Russia in the short term: logistics without the rail hub at Kupiansk, equipment loss, the worsening state of the Russian economy, and increased pressure from neutral nations to stop this war from becoming a multi-year endeavor. Eyeballing it, I don't think partial mobilization puts Russia's ability to wage war ahead of Ukraine's will to resist.\n\nThe other thing Russia could do is lower Ukraine' capacity to resist, although that is even harder because Ukraine can trade space for time and not have their capacity to resist degraded in a meaningful way. IMO there are three things that Russia can do to lower Ukraine's capacity to resist: encircle/destroy a significant portion of the UAF, take Kyiv and decapitate Ukraine's leadership, or convince NATO to abandon their mission to supply Ukraine. I certainly don't foresee partial mobilization making the first two happen, and the new policy is only likely to increase Western resolve.\n\nSo in short, I think its credible to say that this is Putin doubling down on a bad venture. It's unlikely that partial mobilization will force a favorable political settlement for Russia, and will probably only prolong the conflict. Even if Putin manages to freeze the frontlines, the longer-term impacts of the war on the Russian economy (and at this point Russian society) will make the project unsustainable long term. The only consequence likely here is that this war might end up costing 250k lives instead of 100k.",

Nor do I think he knows that he can't win the war, given how much he has repeated how this is about the liberation of Donbas (even from the beginning I might add, Russian media has always focused on it) I don't think he will try settle until he captures all of it either.

Her actions/policy somewhat allowed Russian to deal with initial sanctions blow and avoid immediate collapse, conversly buying Putin&#39;s time to end the conflict.

Regardless of what they say about Donbas, that's what they really wanted to get out of the war. That's what they still want to get, even if they know now that will not happen without suing for peace and trying again 5-20 years later.\n\nGiven that, *who cares* how many men and what kind of men Russia uses to do it? Their goals have not actually changed, and are still maximalist in nature. How is it \"escalatory\" to throw more men into it, when it is already a war of conquest?\n\nIt would be one thing if we were talking about going from \"Little Green Men in Donbas\" -> \"Military Advisors from Russia in Donbas\" -> \"Russia is going to annex Donbas after deploying armored brigades there\" \u2010> \"Russia is going to de-nazify the entirety of Ukraine by militarily imposed regime change.\" With each step of that escalation ladder, the actual nature of what is being fought over and how is changing. Nothing actually changed yesterday other than that Russia is throwing more men into the same meat grinder for the same purpose.\n\nAnd besides, the logic of calling it an escalation and suggesting there needs to be a western response implicitly holds that the west would like to discourage this behavior.

            "body": "Hertling is an idiot. \n\nIt's amazing how he could have commanded US Army forces in Europe, whose chief opponent was Russia, and yet know so little about them. Even in September 2022, 7 months after this war started, and he still describes the Russians as a conscript force (which is funny because the UAF relied on conscription even more than Russia did). His comments should really drive home what isn't expected of a general officer to know and understand to get promoted. \n\nTLDR:Russia isn't the US Army, and Hertling doesn't understand the differences. The issues that Russia will face training new troops and manning new units will be due to things Hertling doesn't bring up, which is that the cadre in every unit meant to train new troops are gone, already sent to Ukraine, so it's uncertain who they can use. And no cadre left to build new maneuver units either.\n\nLong version: The US Army's modern Basic Training Center system is based on WW2 Replacement Training Centers. During that time there were two ways to train new Soldiers. Everyone spent a couple weeks at an induction center learning the most rudimentary aspects of military life while doing physicals, taking tests, etc. Then they either went to their unit to first do basic training in the same unit they were expected to go to oversees with (think of Band of Brothers), while others were sent to Replacement Training Centers to act as replacements to either go to formed units still training to fill them up or to already deployed, and in combat. During the war and especially afterwards the Army did studies that found the RTCs actually had better training ON AVERAGE than those done by the field divisions, because the RTC training was standardized and very controlled by Army Ground Forces command while it was less soin the field divisions. So after the war, the Army adopted the RTC as the new model to train new Soldiers and turned that into Basic Training as we know it now.\n\nThe Soviet Union had nothing like that during WW2. They didn't only use an individual replacement system like the US Army did, they used every single training way possible, because they were desperate and things were chaotic. They built new units with new soldiers from scratch, fed individual replacements in, amalgamated units, etc. After the war they kept the traditionalist regional and unit focused means of recruitment and training. Everyone in the Soviet Union and now Russia lives in a military district, each is responsible for recruitment, retention, training, readiness. Each has a certain number of initial training centers (an actual expert said [here](https://www.armyupress.army.mil/Journals/NCO-Journal/Archives/2019/March/Russian-ncos/) that there are 29) where they get six weeks of basic training before going to an MOS school.\n\nThe real issue that Hertling doesn't mention is that most of the Russian army cadre that would have been left behind at actual training bases in every brigade or regiment's partially filled third battalion (used for unit training, especially conscripts) when the war started had themselves been rounded up afterwards in the March to May time period to create the third BTGs for all the deployed brigades and regiments that already went into battle. After those got used up as a replacement source, that's when Russia started reverting to offering heavily bribed contracts to reservists and veterans. So the issue is now that there won't be the random personnel of good to even mediocre officers and NCOs still in Russia waiting to be detailed as instructors or to command/run the training units, or to serve as the cadre for the new units that will be created (which need more than just privates that were only trained as basic rifleman). \n\nSo where do the new Russian trainers come from? There are ways to do it, none easy and none efficient. But they can half ass it to make it work (pull some from Ukraine, use newly recalled reservists, use the Refuseniks, etc).\n\nThe bigger issue is after they are basically trained. Where do they go then? Are MOS schools ready to take in large numbers? Where are all the non infantrymen being trained? Are those schools going to expand? Try to fast track it? Are the limited number of officer training academies (4-5 years long) going to fast track to \"shake and bake\" Officer Candidate Schools?.\n\nAnd what happens after they finish that? A whole bunch of brand new privates and junior lieutenants does not a unit make. They need NCOs and a slew of competent officers to fill them at the command and staff level, especially outside of combat arms MOS. They also need equipment in working order to train and deploy with. And they'll need stores of supplies sufficient for them too. And all of that is unanswered at this point, prospects don't look that good to use them for defensive ops (which as the recent Kharkiv counteroffensive shows is more than just manning fixed defenses on the front line) or offensive either, at least not for the foreseeable future. \n\nAlso, the Ukrainians didn't take the US Army model to heart. Hertling is part of a cliche of retired US Army colonels and generals who since this war has started have been trying to take credit on social media and MSM news for Ukraine successes by outright stating that UAF competence is because they were trained by and copied the US Army. If fact, they're still closer to Russia in organization, training, doctrine, and traditions than the US Army. \n\nTake training, the US Army goes to GREAT lengths to ensure proper individual and unit training is done before going into battle. In fact it increased OSUT length by a significant amount a few years back, knowing how inconvenient it was and they still did it anyway. The UAF doesn't take training that serious, especially since this war started, they have spent most of it (like the Russians) sending untrained or barely trained troops directly into battle, to the point they (and many on this sub) are now glorifying in the five weeks of very basic training (dismounted infantry) that certain NATO countries are providing for them.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Hertling is an idiot. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s amazing how he could have commanded US Army forces in Europe, whose chief opponent was Russia, and yet know so little about them. Even in September 2022, 7 months after this war started, and he still describes the Russians as a conscript force (which is funny because the UAF relied on conscription even more than Russia did). His comments should really drive home what isn&#39;t expected of a general officer to know and understand to get promoted. </p>\n\n<p>TLDR:Russia isn&#39;t the US Army, and Hertling doesn&#39;t understand the differences. The issues that Russia will face training new troops and manning new units will be due to things Hertling doesn&#39;t bring up, which is that the cadre in every unit meant to train new troops are gone, already sent to Ukraine, so it&#39;s uncertain who they can use. And no cadre left to build new maneuver units either.</p>\n\n<p>Long version: The US Army&#39;s modern Basic Training Center system is based on WW2 Replacement Training Centers. During that time there were two ways to train new Soldiers. Everyone spent a couple weeks at an induction center learning the most rudimentary aspects of military life while doing physicals, taking tests, etc. Then they either went to their unit to first do basic training in the same unit they were expected to go to oversees with (think of Band of Brothers), while others were sent to Replacement Training Centers to act as replacements to either go to formed units still training to fill them up or to already deployed, and in combat. During the war and especially afterwards the Army did studies that found the RTCs actually had better training ON AVERAGE than those done by the field divisions, because the RTC training was standardized and very controlled by Army Ground Forces command while it was less soin the field divisions. So after the war, the Army adopted the RTC as the new model to train new Soldiers and turned that into Basic Training as we know it now.</p>\n\n<p>The Soviet Union had nothing like that during WW2. They didn&#39;t only use an individual replacement system like the US Army did, they used every single training way possible, because they were desperate and things were chaotic. They built new units with new soldiers from scratch, fed individual replacements in, amalgamated units, etc. After the war they kept the traditionalist regional and unit focused means of recruitment and training. Everyone in the Soviet Union and now Russia lives in a military district, each is responsible for recruitment, retention, training, readiness. Each has a certain number of initial training centers (an actual expert said <a href=\"https://www.armyupress.army.mil/Journals/NCO-Journal/Archives/2019/March/Russian-ncos/\">here</a> that there are 29) where they get six weeks of basic training before going to an MOS school.</p>\n\n<p>The real issue that Hertling doesn&#39;t mention is that most of the Russian army cadre that would have been left behind at actual training bases in every brigade or regiment&#39;s partially filled third battalion (used for unit training, especially conscripts) when the war started had themselves been rounded up afterwards in the March to May time period to create the third BTGs for all the deployed brigades and regiments that already went into battle. After those got used up as a replacement source, that&#39;s when Russia started reverting to offering heavily bribed contracts to reservists and veterans. So the issue is now that there won&#39;t be the random personnel of good to even mediocre officers and NCOs still in Russia waiting to be detailed as instructors or to command/run the training units, or to serve as the cadre for the new units that will be created (which need more than just privates that were only trained as basic rifleman). </p>\n\n<p>So where do the new Russian trainers come from? There are ways to do it, none easy and none efficient. But they can half ass it to make it work (pull some from Ukraine, use newly recalled reservists, use the Refuseniks, etc).</p>\n\n<p>The bigger issue is after they are basically trained. Where do they go then? Are MOS schools ready to take in large numbers? Where are all the non infantrymen being trained? Are those schools going to expand? Try to fast track it? Are the limited number of officer training academies (4-5 years long) going to fast track to &quot;shake and bake&quot; Officer Candidate Schools?.</p>\n\n<p>And what happens after they finish that? A whole bunch of brand new privates and junior lieutenants does not a unit make. They need NCOs and a slew of competent officers to fill them at the command and staff level, especially outside of combat arms MOS. They also need equipment in working order to train and deploy with. And they&#39;ll need stores of supplies sufficient for them too. And all of that is unanswered at this point, prospects don&#39;t look that good to use them for defensive ops (which as the recent Kharkiv counteroffensive shows is more than just manning fixed defenses on the front line) or offensive either, at least not for the foreseeable future. </p>\n\n<p>Also, the Ukrainians didn&#39;t take the US Army model to heart. Hertling is part of a cliche of retired US Army colonels and generals who since this war has started have been trying to take credit on social media and MSM news for Ukraine successes by outright stating that UAF competence is because they were trained by and copied the US Army. If fact, they&#39;re still closer to Russia in organization, training, doctrine, and traditions than the US Army. </p>\n\n<p>Take training, the US Army goes to GREAT lengths to ensure proper individual and unit training is done before going into battle. In fact it increased OSUT length by a significant amount a few years back, knowing how inconvenient it was and they still did it anyway. The UAF doesn&#39;t take training that serious, especially since this war started, they have spent most of it (like the Russians) sending untrained or barely trained troops directly into battle, to the point they (and many on this sub) are now glorifying in the five weeks of very basic training (dismounted infantry) that certain NATO countries are providing for them.

We are talking about a country with an extremely long and effective history with heavy machinery, including quite notably turbine engines, there are likely huge numbers of people with exactly the mechanical knowledge  necessary living in Ukraine already. In terms of the gas, yes the consumption is about double a soviet tank, but this doesn't mean it is unsustainable. Ukraine's civilian fuel network recovered very quickly after the initial invasion shock, and if they are still able to provide fuel to civilians then talk about running out of fuel for the military is overblown.\n\nSecond, to the argument that it is too much training to learn, that is equally flimsy. They should have been training already, and if not then when will they start, will this argument simply be used forever? Then, it vastly overstates the difficulty of learning to use a tank, and ignores the fact that Ukraine can likely draw on spare tank crews who are already familiar with things like combat doctrine. Regardless of the sophistication of firing control etc., a tank is a box that moves and shoots. In a day you could learn the basic functions necessary to make it a huge asset on the battlefield, and in a week or two of intensive team training you could be reasonably proficient.

At a certain point, we have to just realize that if nukes are going to be used, then besides being extremely clear about our intentions, caving in to demands is not going to stop it. Russia is genociding Ukraine. We told Russia not to invade, they did so anyways, if we do not follow through with what we understand to be equivalent amounts of force, they will simply never stop. Nobody wants to die in a nuclear holocaust but cowardice will not save us either.\n\nFourth, if the US is worried about losing tech to Russia or more realistically China, then they can still organize some sort of deal to transfer export models from countries like Egypt, Iraq, or Saudi Arabia, which don't have the sophisticated armor. Iraq lost plenty of Abrams to Isis, so there is nothing in these models that isn't already widely out there.

            "body": "Okay. I actually do agree with most of the points here.\n\nLogistics would be tough but not unfeasible. America could send the equipment needed to support more intensive operations involving tanks and IFVs. The pipeline issue is a nonissue for obvious reasons. What Ukraine needs is the ability to set up robust supply hubs that can distribute supplies expediently to wherever they are needed. If Ukraine is able to set up pipelines  to these supply hubs, they will be better off during Rasputitsa and winter as the route a supply truck would have to travel would be lessened. In addition, overall the amount of trucks needed to supply these supply hubs would be lessened, allowing them to focus on getting supplies from the hub to the unit. In other words, American-style logistics would be greatly appreciated in Ukraine, Abrams or not. The ability to set up fuel depots quickly and to supply them with temporary pipelines is simply too good to pass up.  Although it should be said that the Abrams does guzzle up a lot of fuel even though it isn\u2019t fussy about what kind of fuel you put in it.\n\nI will contest about repairs though. If you need a tank right now but said tank is in need of repair like if one of the torsion bar broke, you would probably wish you were to repair that nearby in Ukraine. The Ukrainians need to be able to perform general maintenance and to be able to repair the more common issues. They cannot rely on Poland for repairs as it may take too long. The mechanics may not be happy about having to keep inventory of both American and Soviet parts but there\u2019s already a couple examples to learn from. \n\nAnd frankly, there is less of an logistical excuse of sending Bradleys to Ukraine. The Ukrainians already have 10 M270s which have a Bradley derived chassis.  \n\nThere are a couple of nuances for training. While the general concept is the same, there are multiple differences between western tanks  and their soviet counterparts. The soviet tank has a lower profile and terrible gun depression to the point that the hull is actually slightly angled downwards to compensate. They are also lighter in order to facilitate use of the less developed infrastructure present in the region although their reverse speed leaves much to be desired. There is also the autoloader and the fact that there are 3 tank crew members. Western tanks are the opposite. They are larger, heavier and taller. They rely on armor and if applicable, being able to fight in a hull down position. There is now an additional crew member, the loader. The reverse speed is decent while some might struggle with bridges. There are also the specifics like how to manipulate the fire control system and how general maintenance should be done. However, the crux of the issue is not the differences themselves but rather getting used to them and unlearning what they learned from using soviet tanks. It will take time for this to happen, however, it is not a major issue given enough time. In this case it would be best to train experienced tank crews who know what the situation is like on the frontlines on the how to use the functions of the tank and let them decide on how best to use them with some western advice. This would allow them to train others in Ukraine proper. We don\u2019t need to train them in the specifics of western tank doctrine. Instead, give them the tools to succeed and let them decide when to use them. It just might take a bit longer to get to that point compared to less complex systems. \n\nThe third. Escalation. Putin has already escalated by implementing partial mobilization and by holding referendums in captured territories. Frankly, how do tanks cause an escalation? Putin might throw a fit but tanks alone aren\u2019t going to cause WW3. \n\nAs for the last part, we could just use the older Abrams in reserve.\n\nI will argue that Bradleys would be the better choice at the moment. More mechanized infantry in vehicles that can actually engage something other than infantry and lightly armored vehicles would allow Ukrainian forces to reposition and attack gaps in Russian defenses. Ukraine has already proven themselves to be competent with their infantry and their execution of maneuver warfare. Let us give them something that will capitalize on that. M113s and HMMWVs may be great in lower intensity combat but for situations where encounters with armored units is expected, an IFV is required. I\u2019m not saying that America should send Bradleys instead of Abrams. They should send both as both are meant to complement each other. Even though you\u2019re better off in a Bradley than a BMP, you still want to avoid getting shot at by a tank or another IFV. It is just that Bradleys should come first to supplement the already existing BMPs and BMDs in order to get infantry from point A to B safer and to provide them with support. \n\nBut again I will stress that Ukraine should get the infrastructure and equipment necessary to bolster their lines of communication. Give them more temporary pipelines, more collapsable fuel storage, more equipment to build and defend FOBs, more supply trucks and the sort. By expanding the volume of supplies that can reach the frontlines, we give Ukraine more flexibility  especially during offensives and/or adverse conditions when there is increased strain on logistics. That should come first and foremost.",

But I concede that this is likely not going to happen, ever, after today.</p>\n</div>",

            "body": "Your question is about tactical use:\n\nSo tactically Nukes were always schemed to disrupt troop concentrations. Some of the statistics on Russian concentrations during WWII are insane. Like 2000 howitzers in a 10km stretch type insane. Tactical nukes were intended to block that kind of massive concentration. But by the 1960s the US and USSR had basically accepted that you a) couldn\u2019t ever do that kind of formation in a nuclear war and b) had to assume that the war could nuclearize any minute, so even in a conventional conflict you had to think about low density and rapid maneuver. I\u2019d actually argue that\u2019s the moment when the US (and also the USSR, to some extent) crafted this new post-mass reality we live in. For example it\u2019s out of this that we get the BMP with the AT-3, an IFV that can operate on its own against any threat. \n\nSo post 1960s nuke thought changed. You still wanted to think about ways to break up concentrations and hit targets of opportunity, but those would be few and far between. Really nukes would be used for three things 1) infrastructure 2) fixed command points & mil infrastructure and 3) in places where you absolutely needed to win. Against civilian infrastructure bombs would obviously very easily take out bridges, destroy rail centers, and flatten infrastructure. But it would also irradiate the area, and high radiation bombs would make it difficult to repair the are. Also troops would have to adopt NBC measures to even pass through the area, making things that much more painful (and can you imagine recovering a broken down tank!) In that regard nuclear and chemical weapons had overlapping uses. Against military infrastructure, and especially command posts, nukes would offer a way to smash links in the chain of command. They could knock out field command posts easily, but the USSR also hoped they would work against army and NATO HQs in the rear to paralyze the operational response. Last, nukes would be viable in the event that you needed to stop, or restart, an attack. In that case you may not kill many men, but if you take out the right regiment you could stop an attack or slow it significantly. Or you could erase a well built defensive position to restore the freedom of maneuver, which was a major component (probably) of Soviet nuclear doctrine. For the Soviets, the go to solution to an unbeatable defensive position would be to use nuclear weapons to open it up. \n\nTactically there could be some use on a weapon as it would probably be easy to destroy command posts and I bet that the UA\u2019s NBC situation is not great. A bomb in the Izyum battle, for example, would have probably done a lot to destabilize the rapid advance. In Kherson, where the rate of advance is slower, I don\u2019t think it would be as useful unless the UA heavily concentrated on the ground. Attacking command points might be a good idea there, but would it be enough to stop the operation? Who knows. Nobody has ever used a tactical nuke, so nobody knows how it might change the battlefield. \n\nOf course it all ignored the bigger question, how does this change the war on a strategic level. Again, nobody knows for sure. But a lot of stuff has been and continues to be posted about that, so I\u2019ll leave that discussion to the other Redditors. My own thought is that nothing could be gained on the battlefield which would justify the strategic defeat of resorting to such a weapon. I think it would really probably destroy Russia\u2019s position internationally.",

But by the 1960s the US and USSR had basically accepted that you a) couldn\u2019t ever do that kind of formation in a nuclear war and b) had to assume that the war could nuclearize any minute, so even in a conventional conflict you had to think about low density and rapid maneuver. I\u2019d actually argue that\u2019s the moment when the US (and also the USSR, to some extent) crafted this new post-mass reality we live in. For example it\u2019s out of this that we get the BMP with the AT-3, an IFV that can operate on its own against any threat. </p>\n\n<p>So post 1960s nuke thought changed. You still wanted to think about ways to break up concentrations and hit targets of opportunity, but those would be few and far between. Really nukes would be used for three things 1) infrastructure 2) fixed command points &amp; mil infrastructure and 3) in places where you absolutely needed to win. Against civilian infrastructure bombs would obviously very easily take out bridges, destroy rail centers, and flatten infrastructure. But it would also irradiate the area, and high radiation bombs would make it difficult to repair the are. Also troops would have to adopt NBC measures to even pass through the area, making things that much more painful (and can you imagine recovering a broken down tank!) In that regard nuclear and chemical weapons had overlapping uses. Against military infrastructure, and especially command posts, nukes would offer a way to smash links in the chain of command. They could knock out field command posts easily, but the USSR also hoped they would work against army and NATO HQs in the rear to paralyze the operational response. Last, nukes would be viable in the event that you needed to stop, or restart, an attack. In that case you may not kill many men, but if you take out the right regiment you could stop an attack or slow it significantly. Or you could erase a well built defensive position to restore the freedom of maneuver, which was a major component (probably) of Soviet nuclear doctrine. For the Soviets, the go to solution to an unbeatable defensive position would be to use nuclear weapons to open it up. </p>\n\n<p>Tactically there could be some use on a weapon as it would probably be easy to destroy command posts and I bet that the UA\u2019s NBC situation is not great. A bomb in the Izyum battle, for example, would have probably done a lot to destabilize the rapid advance. In Kherson, where the rate of advance is slower, I don\u2019t think it would be as useful unless the UA heavily concentrated on the ground. Attacking command points might be a good idea there, but would it be enough to stop the operation? Who knows. Nobody has ever used a tactical nuke, so nobody knows how it might change the battlefield. </p>\n\n<p>Of course it all ignored the bigger question, how does this change the war on a strategic level. Again, nobody knows for sure. But a lot of stuff has been and continues to be posted about that, so I\u2019ll leave that discussion to the other Redditors. My own thought is that nothing could be gained on the battlefield which would justify the strategic defeat of resorting to such a weapon. I think it would really probably destroy Russia\u2019s position internationally.</p>\n</div>",
