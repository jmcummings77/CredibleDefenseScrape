        "body": "A reflection that I consider important after yesterday's article on the 28th Brigade (a victim not only of the strength of Wagner's attack in itself, but also of a rushed deployment after the hard battles of Kherson - same with the 128th) and Zelensky's visit to Marinka today, where he met the Ukrainian marines who have been defending the sector for months. I reckon a very important issue is that of rotations. \n\nThere are under-appreciated brigades that among \"media\" silence have been doing their utmost duty for months in the secondary sectors of the front. Let's look at the lions of the 72nd Brigade, in Vuhledar since October (okay, they are well known luckily!), but also the 14th in Kupyansk, the 66th along the banks of the Zherebets, the 95th that took part in the Kharkiv counter-offensive and has been holding positions near Kreminna basically ever since. The 10th Mountain Assault Brigade has been in the Soledar sector since... early October, I think? The two marine brigades around Avdiivka as written above, the 79th in Marinka and so on...\n\nThis tells us two things imho. The first, and good news, is that they did not suffer too significant losses. Generally, looking at the deployment map of the formations, we notice that when a brigade is pulled off from the front it's usually because of significant losses impacting its basic efficiency (the 128th and 46th at Soledar, the 24th at Bakhmut in January, also the 93rd in December before it returned two months later...). The second, however, is that inevitably, as the weeks go by, attrition runs its course , fighting capabilities worsen and there are risks of burn-out and morale issues among the troops; the command risks exhaustion as well. Of course, rotations are always taking place at intra-brigade level, between battalions and companies, and some new recruits may arrive. But as losses accumulate, battalions become more and more organic to the brigade and less and less independent units.\n\nI am personally convinced that we will soon witness a large rotation of formations at the front as the newly formed brigades arrive. The Ukrainian Army has never been as large as it is now, it has many new brigades that are on average well trained and this allows them to be smartly deployed avoiding the serious problems experienced in Donbass from May to August 2022 that created a negative moment in several sectors. In any case, I think that in war an army doesn't have to and cannot be perfect, it has to be better than the opponent... and the Russians are doing their best to make this an easy task for Ukraine.\n\nThese months have bought time to finish training of the new brigades; now the ones that have been holding the front for a long time deserve a rest in the safe rear to replenish manpower and equipment and recover offensive capabilities. Beyond the hyped counter-offensive, I am convinced that part of the new brigades will have to replace the existing ones for the summer period. There are certainly existing brigades that have been resting for months as of now, such as the 62nd, 63rd, 65th (the latter completed the formation of its tank battalion last month) or the 115th. In my opinion, some of the new brigades being formed might be strictly destined to offensive operations (we have seen the 23rd training in trench assault, the 32nd receiving Bradley's and the 33rd with Leopard 2A4s, then perhaps the 21st, 22nd, 31st, certainly the 47th and 82nd) while probably others (the two new marine brigades? The 116th, 117th and 118th brigades? Or those outside the 10th Operational Corp, if the leaks are to be taken by the book?) could be destined to replace the brigades on the frontline today. Paging u/antipenko about this, whom I always read with extreme interest when I happen to be here.\n\nWith the additions of 2023 I believe that the Ukrainian Army has reached a well-balanced number of brigades in relation to manpower and equipment capabilities, and now the focus could be on reforming some territorial defence brigades (e.g. those from Western Ukraine) as rifle or motorized brigades and on exploiting the large pool of men the TDF has at its disposal as efficiently as possible. \n\nA final note is on the Ukrainian tank brigades, which have seen relatively little action in recent times (with the partial exception of the 17th). I think one reason is that they may have acted as a pool to replenish tank losses in other units and perhaps to equip new ones as they wait for Western tanks to be sent in. In addition, the huge failure of the Russian tank division model with too much armour in relation to men may have convinced the Ukrainian General Staff to concentrate on forming new mechanized rather than armoured brigades (look at the 5th Tank Brigade which was never actived). \n\nI believe Ukrainian tactical model could look towards separate tank battalions, along the lines of those the US Army fielded during WW2 - battalions that were temporarily attached to a division as part of an attack, for armoured reinforcement. In this context, we could see single battalions of the tank brigades being actively integrated into, for example, the Offensive Guard brigades, which we clearly know are being trained for offensive purposes but lack a sizeable armoured component (generally one tank company I think, but they are not guaranteed to get it due to the MBTs shortage).",

Simply because these were the only two weapons in their arsenal that had a reasonable range and were drone-correctible (by that I mean that you can fire the weapon over a long distance, use a drone feed to observe where the projectile lands, and then make minor trajectory adjustments after each shot, again carefully watching were it lands until you fully zero-in on your enemy). Maybe that is an unpopular take on this subreddit, but I firmly believe that drone-correctable mid-range weapons are the most effective military strategy for units like the 28th Brigade, especially considering their current circumstances\u2014engaging in positional trench warfare around FTOL in Ukraine.\n\nMy second argument is that Wagner's success can be largely attributed to their superior long-range firepower (mortars, artillery, etc), in comparison to the Ukraine's forces defending Bakhmut. This explain why Prigozhin went 100% berserk whenever he received even slightly fewer artillery shells than he wanted.\n\n---\n\nAdditionally, I also have this feeling that the Bakhmut forces somewhat sacrificed to bear the brunt of Wagner's assault.

This explain why Prigozhin went 100% berserk whenever he received even slightly fewer artillery shells than he wanted.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Additionally, I also have this feeling that the Bakhmut forces somewhat sacrificed to bear the brunt of Wagner&#39;s assault. This strategy seems to be designed to allow Ukraine to get more time to assemble new brigades, equipped with recently acquired Western weapons, for the future offensive.</p>\n</div>",

If Putin sees his popularity collapse as a result of his failures in Ukraine and a loss of Crimea, his calculus might be that cutting his losses and agreeing to peace where he claims some kind of win (let the propaganda spin it however they want) will save him enough popularity to &quot;win&quot; the election without incurring political instability.</p>\n</div>",

There are marked phonetical differences between the two languages but it's not quite as easy as \"English with an Eastern European accent\".\n\nUkrainian is an East Slavic language; East Slavic languages are literally spoken from the Baltic to the Pacific, so there's considerable geographical variation even within the same language. Some Russian speakers, for example, merge the /o/ (and sometimes /e/) and [a] vowels in some positions, a distinct enough style of pronounciation that it has its own name (\u0430\u0301\u043a\u0430\u043d\u044c\u0435).\n\nBecause East Slavic languages are fairly close to one another phonetically, speakers do frequently transfer traits of their accent between languages. Akanye is a good example -- it's most commonly associated with some Russian dialects, but it's also present in some Northern Ukrainian dialects, and it's an *actual thing* in Belarussian, as in, the [a]-reduced /o/ is ortographically represented as an \"a\", rather than an \"o\" (i.e. you don't write 'o' and pronounce 'a' as in Russian, you really do write 'a').\n\nSince many of these traits are common, it's somewhat difficult to isolate accents between them, because the same trait may be common to regional accents of both Ukrainian and Russian. Ukrainian has a number of distinctive phonetic traits that do not readily translate to Russian and vice-versa, so presumably a native Russian who's grown up among Russians and speaks Ukrainian as a second language might carry some of them across. However, many of these are things that are easy to miss, e.g. final devoicing on obstructives like z, which you do either because you're used to Russian or because you have a slight lisp, or pallatalizing mid-word rs, like the r in Kharkiv, which you might do just because your mouth's dry.\n\nDifferences that are more likely to be noticed are those in pronounciation of related, but common terms, e.g. rus. \u044f\u0439\u0446\u043e vs. ukr. \u044f\u0439\u0446\u0435 (egg) (i.e. things you might spill without noticing), or in pronounciation of some proper nouns. However, the former are not unambiguous among fluent speakers (for a more easily-conveyed example: I roll my rs, which makes my accent easily mistaken for an American accent, but that's just because I can't pronounce some variations of [r] so I just roll all of them), and the latter type of marker is ambiguous throughout the post-Soviet space.\n\n(Edit: to clarify, all of these are substantial differences. They easily stand out in a conversation. Even without any linguistic training, you'd hear them, it's just you'd describe them in terms of \"the rs are harder\" or \"the z is less obvious\". However, if you're just hearing someone saying five random sentences on camera while they're riding in a Humvee, you get maybe two or three obvious markers, and most of them aren't entirely unambiguous)\n\nCaveat: I am nowhere near fluent in either Russian or Ukrainian but I am reasonably good with how accents go. This being the Internet, I am fairly sure than a native speaker of either language will be able to correct any of that if it's nonsense!",

Well we didn&#39;t do anything other than push them out last time, so we&#39;re not going to do anything drastic over them getting slightly further.</p>\n\n<p>Rinse and repeat until the idea of Ukraine invading Russia has become sufficiently normalized, and Ukraine can get away with outright pushing into Russia, deeply, if and when the situation calls for it, without the Russian public thinking anything <em>particularly</em> outrageous has happened, and without the Russian government deciding that a messy full mobilization is called for for the sake of protecting their national dignity and pushing the &quot;invaders&quot; out at all costs.</p>\n\n<p>As an added bonus, the more Ukraine does this, the more Russia has to man the border. If Ukraine were never willing to invade Russia in any capacity, then Russia could theoretically leave its border more or less unprotected, and concentrate all of its forces in captured Ukrainian territory to make more effective use of them.</p>\n</div>",

The notion of Salami slicing comes from Beaufre's *An Introduction to Strategy* which he terms as \"piecemeal maneuvers\" the intent of which is to obtain an objective behind the nuclear threshold by breaking it into much smaller pieces, each of which does not trigger a nuclear escalation by itself. Therefore a state can obtain gains piecemeal (slice by slice) that, had they attempted to gain all at once, would have resulted in nuclear war. The key example here is Hitler's piecemeal gains in Europe prior to the invasion of Poland.\n\nAs Beaufre highlights, in order for salami tactics to be successful, they have to be a *fait accompli* as no one is willing to escalate to nuclear weapons use when the battle is already lost. Another critical component to this is that the state is incapable of *responding* to a salami tactic without nuclear weapons, thus the defender has to confront the dilemma of either using nuclear weapons over something immensely small *or* allowing it to happen. \n\nIn this case Russia can, and has, responded with a conventional deterrent. \n\n>Is anything different? Has anything changed? Have the nukes flown yet?\n\nNo one expects nukes to fly over a minor border raid. There is such a thing as proportionality for starters, but more broadly speaking nuclear weapons buy you a certain element of defensive inviolability, but it turns out their deterrent quality is really only credible in extreme cases (state survival, for example). No one is actually certain where this line really *is* but that's common to all models of deterrence, save for in very specific scenarios.. \n\n>They haven't, of course. And so the next time this happens on a slightly larger scale, Russians will think back to the last time and be less likely to respond drastically. Oh, they took 30 square km instead of 20? Well we didn't do anything other than push them out last time, so we're not going to do anything drastic over them getting slightly further.\n\nThis is quite literally the exact opposite of how escalatory dynamics work. It's why Khan referred to it as an escalation \"ladder\" (although the better conception is perhaps an elevator that is easier to run in one direction rather than the other). There are numerous historical counter-examples of states reaching a \"tipping point\" (see: Thomas Schelling) where states feel they are *forced* to respond to a series of small but building escalations. Submarine warfare against American merchant vessels in WW1 is typically the most cited example, but so is the British / French response to German piecemeal aggression in WW2. You'll note that in both cases, with each successive action by Germany, the escalatory risks became *higher* not lower and the probability of open conflict *increased* rather than decreased. Now, there are frameworks under which deterrence breaks down thanks to a lack in *capability* but this hardly seems appropriate for this scenario.   \n\n\n>Rinse and repeat until the idea of Ukraine invading Russia has become sufficiently normalized\n\nNuclear armed states have a strong tendency to take territorial integrity extraordinarily seriously. I have a hard time believing in your \"normalization\" theory. Do you have any examples of nuclear states *not* responding to territorial violations?\n\n>Ukraine can get away with outright pushing into Russia, deeply, if and when the situation calls for it, without the Russian public thinking anything particularly outrageous has happened, and without the Russian government deciding that a messy full mobilization is called for for the sake of protecting their national dignity and pushing the \"invaders\" out at all costs.\n\nThis is wishful thinking and is not rooted in any deterrence framework or historical example I can think of. \n\n>As an added bonus, the more Ukraine does this, the more Russia has to man the border.

The invasion triggered what they call \u201cthe great German gas debate\u201d between disagreeing groups of economists, with business lobbies and unions weighing in about whether the economic cost of ending Russian gas imports would be bearable.\n\t\n> As Moll and his colleagues remind us, some of these predictions were apocalyptic: up to 12 per cent loss of economic output and millions losing their jobs. Those arguing the losses would be much smaller were berated by chancellor Olaf Scholz himself for \u201cirresponsible\u201d theorising.\n\n> Politically, the debate was won by the doom-mongers. The impressive speed with which Berlin found substitute sources of gas and built emergency infrastructure makes it easy to forget that Germany did not in fact choose to go without Russian gas. That was a decision Putin made for it by throttling gas supplies before stopping them altogether late last summer. And the EU as a whole took too long to agree its still-incomplete restrictions on Russian energy imports.\n\n> But the truth was on the optimists\u2019 side. (I had a dog in this fight: I argued a week into the war that Europe could and should go \u201ccold turkey\u201d on Russian gas imports.) As Moll and his colleagues make clear, Germany\u2019s growth outcome has been as good as the rosiest estimates of the energy war\u2019s toll. There was no \u201ccascade\u201d of production cuts, bankruptcies and lay-offs from the most energy-intensive industries to the wider economy. Despite a drop in March, manufacturing output remains greater than a year earlier.\n\n> The authors even find that, according to German meteorological data, temperatures were no higher than the multiyear trend: if so, the idea that Germany was saved by a warm winter seems to be a myth. The gas left in storage by the end of the heating season means Germany never needed the Russian gas it bought before Putin closed the taps. Cold turkey would have been perfectly feasible.\n\n> The resilience of Germany\u2019s economy is something to celebrate. More important is to learn the right lesson. Why did the balance of opinion wrongly oppose a morally and geostrategically right policy for being prohibitively expensive?\n\n> The inexcusable answer is a desire by some in corporate Germany not to have to face any economic cost at all for standing up to Putin. The more understandable, if disappointing, answer involves intellectual mistakes. There is a general lack of appreciation in continental Europe \u2014 for this goes beyond Germany \u2014 of how adaptable market economies are. It is reinforced by mistaking challenges to existing businesses for threats to the overall economy, when in fact the creative destruction of unadaptive companies is what makes market economies grow. In addition, European leaders have long internalised an outdated criticism of the European economy as particularly inflexible and \u201csclerotic\u201d.\n\n> Germany\u2019s great gas debate is only the most egregious example of how Europeans underrate their own economic adaptability. There are others. Few expected that the post-pandemic recovery would take employment rates to record highs \u2014 in stark contrast to the lagging US and UK labour markets. The EU\u2019s taboo-breaking recovery fund is fuelling growth in countries many had written off as perennial basket cases.\n\n> If we don\u2019t draw the right lessons from such examples, we will persist in an overly timid understanding of what Europe\u2019s economies can deliver. The policy risks from such misdiagnosis are all around us, reinforced by the self-pleading of corporate incumbents.\n\n> Brussels has been forced to slow down the pace of its decarbonisation policies. Germany and France have both mounted rearguard actions against important legislation. French President Emmanuel Macron has demanded a \u201cregulatory break\u201d. German carmakers want to delay the EU-UK trade deal\u2019s penalisation of electric cars with batteries made outside Europe.\n\n> In all these examples, the argument is that too much change is too difficult. But as the German gas debate shows, an economy is more flexible than the sum of its parts. If some companies are unwilling to change, dynamic markets make space for those that are willing and able to adapt.

It was big news recently that they were at 100% renewable production for a whole big fucking whopping 9, count &#39;em NINE <strong>HOURS</strong> last year.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s why they also have 30GW in gas turbines on standby. </p>\n\n<p>Renewables is gas.</p>\n</div>",

It's useful to be able to categorize those losses as sublinear, superlinear, or roughly linear across various periods of the conflict, which in turn gives us a rough sense of what scale of losses to expect. And frankly, any more sophisticated model would likely be overfitted and so would have extremely poor predictive power and would not be as useful as a linear model for descriptive analysis. \n\nYou're right that McNamara's problem wasn't that he relied on quantitative analysis. It was that he failed to contextualize the statistics and apply common sense to them. He didn't understand the limits of his model (which /u/BeondTheGrave describes well and I won't rehash here). I think people harp on /u/taw a little too much because they expect his model to have predictive power, when in fact it is primarily useful for descriptive purposes. Descriptively, it provides a good eyeball estimate of how quickly the Russians have been burning through their available resources. Interestingly, the trend seems to be superlinear when the Russians are on the offensive and sublinear when they are largely on the defensive, with the notable exception of the Kharkiv counteroffensive. That suggests the Russians are better at protecting their armor on the defensive during positional battles (unsurprisingly really), and we likely can expect to see a slow down in Russian armor losses as we transition to a period of intensified Ukrainian counteroffensives, unless they achieve a breakthrough like they did in Kharkiv and are able to transition from positional trench fighting to maneuver warfare that puts more rear area Russian armor assets at risk of capture or destruction. All of that is useful information we can glean from the model. However, as people are so quick to point out, we can't just linearly extrapolate the trend line all the way out to October 2023 and assume that is an accurate date for the Russians to run out of tanks. In no small part because it assumes the Russians will continue to risk their armor assets at the same rate as they reach the bottom of the barrel and that the intensity of the war won't vary over time.\n\nBut we can say that the Russians need to lower their loss rate substantially below the historical trend lines *even for the periods where they have been fighting defensive positional battles* if they don't want to run out of tanks sometime late this year, or maybe early next year if they have larger reserves than most estimates credit them with at this point. So while the model does not tell us *precisely* when the Russians will run out of tanks, it does tell us that they are perilously close to doing so and need to dramatically improve their loss rates if they want to stay in this fight much past the next 6-12 months, and maybe even sooner if the Ukrainians are able to replicate their success around Kharkiv, where they destroyed or captured around 200 tanks within a matter of days. Given that we know the Ukrainians have recently received a large volume of superior quality western tanks and IFVs that have not yet been committed to combat, it seems unlikely that the Russians will be able to decrease their loss rate relative to what they have experienced facing Ukrainian units equipped with legacy Soviet kit and relatively low quality legacy western kit like M113s (relative to the modern western equipment that has been donated more recently). So even in the absence of a successful counteroffensive resulting in Russian tank losses on the scale of Kharkiv, the outlook for Russian tanks is pretty bleak.",

Even if they flee into a village and drop their weapons, the dogs will be able to find them. Further ambushes on the airborne forces can be dealt with similarly.\n\nMaybe you can\u2019t use mass MLRS fire on ambushes in populated areas, but a lot of ambushes took place in fields or the wilderness, and you can still fly drones around and fire 155mm PGK in villages.

I know this phrase sounds cool and it makes us think we know a thing or two about international relationships, but that's just silly. Does anyone have any proof that if USA would have provided HIMARS and Abrams in the first days of the war, the Russians would have used nukes to retaliate? Even the boiling frog is myth, but somehow its holds true for a war.\n\nIt seems like you're making a category error here. You're asking for a sort of proof that is never available in these circumstances.\n\nWhen we talk about evidence, we are often talking about things like physics. Physicists conduct experiments where they, for example, drop things and see how fast they fall. And they drop the items repeatedly and see if they keep falling at similar speeds or if they fall at different speeds. And they them come up with guesses, such as that air resistance and gravity affect the speeds that things fall at. Then they conduct more tests, for example dropping one item in a vacuum and then dropping it in atmosphere and seeing if one falls faster. And by conducting these tests repeatedly, they reach a high level of confidence that air resistance impacts how quickly things fall.\n\nNow your objection appears to be that we don't have that sort of evidence here. After all, we did something once, and it didn't cause a nuclear war. But if we did it again, maybe it would cause a nuclear war. We don't know because we only ran the experiment once. And if we didn't do it, would there be a nuclear war in it's absence? Hard to say, we don't have any data at all on that point.\n\nSo why don't we run the experiment again? Well the central problem is that we only have one planet. A physicist testing gravity can reset their experiment to its starting conditions many times in order to see if they get the same results each time. But we only have one Putin, one Biden, one Zelensky, one Ukraine. We can't reset things to their pre invasion state, and even if we got Russia to agree to leave Ukraine, rebuilt the Russian army to it's pre invasion state, and took away all the gear Ukraine has acquired over the course of the war, and brought the dead back to life to try to run the experiment again, we can't take away the knowledge that everyone has gained from running the experiment the first time, which would likely influence the results.\n\nBut this doesn't mean that the entire field of international theory or political science, it any it the other social sciences are fake. They can't reach the same degree of confidence in their findings as physics, but they still are creating something. They create theories based on the past events they have studied. Then they look at whether those theories help them predict or understand present and future events. Then they refine them, or discard them when competing theories are discovered to perform better.\n\nAnyway, that's how the different fields of science work.",

Russian GDP (PPP) is 10 times higher while population is only 3 times higher than in Ukraine. You are being paid by Western sponsors who control your government. Remove Zelensky from power, let's unite and live in a common state as we lived during the Soviet times to mutual benefits.\n\nVoice from Ukraine: Yes, the Ukrainians have to work in Europe. Jobs there are dirty and low paid but we are independent nation. We will join NATO and US military bases, including nuclear missiles will be on Ukrainian territory close to Russia. Education now is only in Ukrainian and when we recapture Crimea and Donbas then local population will have to forget Russian, speak only Ukrainian.

Your economy is a joke. Russian GDP (PPP) is 10 times higher while population is only 3 times higher than in Ukraine. You are being paid by Western sponsors who control your government. Remove Zelensky from power, let&#39;s unite and live in a common state as we lived during the Soviet times to mutual benefits.</p>\n\n<p>Voice from Ukraine: Yes, the Ukrainians have to work in Europe. Jobs there are dirty and low paid but we are independent nation. We will join NATO and US military bases, including nuclear missiles will be on Ukrainian territory close to Russia. Education now is only in Ukrainian and when we recapture Crimea and Donbas then local population will have to forget Russian, speak only Ukrainian.
