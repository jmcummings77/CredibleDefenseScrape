On the subject of Russian penetration into German military and  intelligence circles:\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/world/europe/hes-wanted-for-wirecards-missing-2-billion-hes-now-suspected-of-being-a-russian-spy-61d79ee2\n\nArchive link: https://archive.is/8UgcU\n\n>Soon after payment-processing giant Wirecard reported in June 2020 that nearly $2 billion had gone missing from its balance sheet, its chief operating officer Jan Marsalek boarded a private jet out of Austria. After a landing in Belarus, he was whisked by car to Moscow, where he got a Russian passport under an assumed name.\n\n>Western intelligence and security officials now say they have reached the unsettling conclusion that Marsalek had likely been a Russian agent for nearly a decade.\n\n> Marsalek already stands accused of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars from investors. Following multiple international investigations, officials from intelligence, police and judiciary agencies in several countries now say the 43-year-old native of Austria used his defunct payments company to illegally help Russian spy agencies move money to fund covert operations around the world.\nOne of the most wanted men in the world, Marsalek has also provided assistance to the mercenary organization of Yevgeny Prigozhin, the late Russian warlord, and is now involved in the reconfiguration of his business empire in Africa on behalf of Russian officials from his new domicile in Dubai, according to Western intelligence.\n\n> Wirecard got its start processing payments for pornography websites on its way to becoming an Internet finance behemoth. During its heyday, the company claimed to process $140 billion of transactions a year on behalf of a quarter million businesses, making it a rival of Square and PayPal Holdings. It was briefly valued at more than any German bank.\n\n> ...\n\n>He was also obsessed with the cloak-and-dagger world of espionage, often intimating that he had connections with intelligence officers, they say\u2014claims many dismissed as bluster.\n\n>In his Munich headquarters, Marsalek once showed a visitor selfies he\u2019d shot with actor Leonardo DiCaprio at the French Open and with Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, a Libyan warlord. On his desk he kept a statuette of Vladimir Putin, according to two people who visited the office.\n\n> ...\n\n>Two former business associates of Marsalek said the executive told them he worked both for Russian intelligence agencies and for their Western counterparts. Marsalek boasted about traveling to Libya and Syria with Russian partners and said he had handled fund transfers for Russian security agencies and mercenaries in both places, they said.\n\n>Marsalek told associates that he had traveled to Libya and Syria with Stanislav Petlinsky, a former Kremlin official who now lives in Monaco. In Syria, he visited the Russia-controlled ancient city of Palmyra, around the time Russia\u2019s Mariinsky Theatre staged an open-air concert in the city\u2019s ancient ruins in 2016, according to intelligence officials.\n\n> British prosecutors say that from 2020 to 2023, Marsalek ran a ring of five U.K. based Bulgarians who are alleged to have spied for Russia, directing them to gather information on people with the aim of helping the Kremlin abduct them. Officials say Marsalek was used by Russian intelligence services as a middleman to put distance between them and the spy network as it targeted individuals across Europe.\n\n> ...\n\n> \"While running Wirecard, Marsalek helped the GRU, Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency, and the SVR, its main overseas spying organization, pay intelligence officers and informants and funnel money into conflict zones in the Middle East and Africa, according to the officials.\n\n> At the same time, these Western officials suspect Marsalek was gathering information on other customers of Munich-based Wirecard, most notably Germany\u2019s main BND intelligence agency and the Federal Criminal Office, the country\u2019s equivalent of the FBI, and handing it over to Moscow.\"\n\n>Such information would represent a treasure trove of data for Russia\u2019s spy services, which, among other things, could let them track the location and scope of German intelligence gathering. Intelligence officials said they have had to move and create new identities for some people possibly compromised.\n\n> Wirecard imploded in what became one of the biggest financial frauds in European history. The company declared itself insolvent in June 2020, after saying it couldn\u2019t locate 1.9 billion euros in cash that it reported on its balance sheet.\n\n> ...\n\n> Germany\u2019s foreign intelligence service, the BND, as well as the country\u2019s equivalent of the FBI, the BKA, told parliament during a public inquiry that ran from September 2020 to June 2021 that they had used Wirecard credit cards and bank accounts for their agents abroad as well as for paying informants at home and abroad. Senior German intelligence officials confirmed this to The Wall Street Journal.\n\n>...\n\n>BKA relied heavily on Wirecard. At the time of its collapse, the company was handling a third of credit card payments that BKA officers used to pay informants, the BKA said.\n\n>A senior member of the German intelligence community said the services used Wirecard because it was more amenable than many other Western-regulated banks, which are often reluctant to work with intelligence agencies for compliance and legal reasons and fears of reputational damage.\n\n>Wirecard\u2019s services were used to finance Russian covert operations, pay informers or military contractors and fund classified projects such as arms purchases, intelligence officials said. \n\n>The CIA and the FBI said they had no record of a relationship between the agencies and Marsalek. British officials said there was no evidence of any relationship between Marsalek and the country\u2019s intelligence community.\n\n>German security officials say the real identities of agents aren\u2019t connected to clandestine bank accounts, so Marsalek\u2019s ability to pass sensitive data about German activities to Russia was limited. \n\n>But Marsalek had access to the agents\u2019 aliases and would have been able to track some of their movements and activities by monitoring payments and purchases, according to officials familiar with the investigation.\n\n> Marsalek ordered Wirecard Bank employees to breach data-protection and other rules to compile data about clients, according to testimony by former executives to German prosecutors. Several intelligence officials said it could have provided information about intelligence agents\u2019 work. Wirecard\u2019s former chief product officer, Susane Steidl, said Marsalek had overruled objections to collecting customer data and told her in 2019 he needed the data for the BND\u2014something the agency categorically denies.\n\n>Some officials suspect he was passing this data on to Russia. Marsalek, who was jetting around the globe as an executive, chose Russia as his most frequent destination, taking dozens of trips there in the years before he was forced to flee to Moscow, according to investigators and intelligence officials.\n\n>Counterintelligence officials declined to comment on how they had dealt with the fallout but said that the agents affected would have had to change their aliases and sever all links to the bank.\nBritish prosecutors allege that between 2020 and 2023, Marsalek helped run a network of five agents\u2014all Bulgarian nationals\u2014in the U.K. British police found three of the alleged agents had fake passports and official identity documents for countries including France, Italy, Spain and the Czech Republic.

Right now the accuracy for real time satellites that are top of the line for the US and China are estimated to be around 6cm and will probably reach 4cm by 2030&#39;s further accuracy beyond that is problematic as other factors come into play. </p>\n\n<p>However satellite imagery is limited by seasonal issues, weather, and exposure time, so often real time satellite imagery is not possible.</p>\n</div>",

                        "body": "I sometimes wonder if there's other fringe motivations possible and whether pro-Russian forces who appear to lionize Putin actually respect Putin.\n\nI think in some ways they think of him as a \"useful idiot\" of their own, someone they can superficially support in order to use as a significant coalition partner against other enemies, like China or Iran.  They don't take Russia seriously as a hegemonic competitor because of US military technology and economic power and thus don't have an existential fear of Russia.  This line of thinking explains hostility to the current support for Ukraine because it pushes Russia into alliances with China, Iran and other US enemies.  A US friendly Russia happily making money selling oil and gas to Europe could be convinced to jack up the price or limit energy sales to China, hobbling their economy or military ambitions.\n\nI also think it could possibly tie into a fairly fringe racist dream of global Caucasian dominance led by the US and Russia.

Maintaining that line is vital in securing those values and freedoms for the future by not becoming another Russia. </p>\n\n<p>All that being said he has the right to an interview(ironically wouldn&#39;t be the case if nationalities were flipped) but he absolutely deserves to be called out and discredited if/when it&#39;s a softball, pro-Russia fluff peice which is almost guaranteed if it happens.</p>\n</div>",

This means that if you detonate the warhead of, say, a Javelin at a distance of 1m from the tank you are *increasing* the penetrative capacity of that round. By a lot. Most rounds cant benefit from this because of the size of the fuse, but if youre dumb enough to count on statistical armor well youre just helping the round designer achieve good effect.

The issue with such cage is that it is a one time use.<br/>\nHence here the tank would store a modern concrete in powder form and when needed regenerate the wide cage &quot;armor&quot; via a liquid concrete that would spread and quickly dry as can be catalyzed by modern concrete chremistry.</p>\n\n<p>Concrete is not a bad material but it is a middle ground, for example it has 1/8 of the resistance of steel and while concrete is much lighter than steel it still makes poor armors, as was shown the the concrete reinforced tanks from WW2  </p>\n\n<p>However because it can be liquefied and quickly dry and because it is not too weak, it is the perfect material for implementing the task of a spaced regenerative armor, which task never has been to absorb damage but simply to deterministically trigger the explosion of the warhead (FPV and ATGMs)</p>\n\n<p>As such, this is in principle the ultimate armor. And can be easily prototyped in a garage.<br/>\nThe only reason it has never been done is that it would be cosmetically ugly which is cringe. it would also reduce visibility awareness but can be palliated via a submarine like periscope and screens.<br/>\nnote: this is made possible because energy disperse non linearly with volume</p>\n</div>",
