The reported Ukrainian attack at Lobkove (west of Orikhiv) is interesting, as both the leaks and open source stuff state that DPR regiments are partly holding that area.

Honestly at this point after looking a little more I think it's an IRIS-T , the distance between the launchers and the front seems to be smaller in the picture compared to the patriot trailer vehicle. The size of the IRIS -T vehicle is 9 something meters while the patriot trailer is 1 meter longer , though the patriot launchers look to be way smaller in size relatively to the vehicle compared to the iris-t launchers which seem almost to be half of the vehicle? Are the iris-t launchers just bigger? Anyway I am overanalyzing this so I am gonna wait for the footage.",

        "body": "The first episode of [Tucker Carlson's new show on Twitter is out](https://twitter.com/TuckerCarlson/status/1666203439146172419).\n\nAlmost the entirety of the 10-minute episode he spends ranting against Ukraine. He accuses Zelenskyy of detonating the Khakovka dam, embezzling billions, and having a \"sweaty and rat-like\" appearance. He runs a manipulated clip of Lindsey Graham (\"killing Russians is the best money we've ever spent\"), and talks about \"we demonized Putin,\" running the whole gamut of his usual Ukraine BS.\n\nI don't understand where it's coming from. This is the first episode of his new show, it's very important, and this is the what he chooses to lead with? What makes vilifying Ukraine so significant/important to him?\n\n\n---\n\n\nEdit: It must be a personal matter to him, as it's difficult to explain otherwise. This stance seems unrelated to domestic politics. He previously attempted to depict Ukraine as anti-Christian in comparison to Russia, which is perplexing. If anything, Ukrainians are more akin to the small-town highly religious 'bumpkins' than Russians are.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>The first episode of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TuckerCarlson/status/1666203439146172419\">Tucker Carlson&#39;s new show on Twitter is out</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Almost the entirety of the 10-minute episode he spends ranting against Ukraine. He accuses Zelenskyy of detonating the Khakovka dam, embezzling billions, and having a &quot;sweaty and rat-like&quot; appearance. He runs a manipulated clip of Lindsey Graham (&quot;killing Russians is the best money we&#39;ve ever spent&quot;), and talks about &quot;we demonized Putin,&quot; running the whole gamut of his usual Ukraine BS.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t understand where it&#39;s coming from. This is the first episode of his new show, it&#39;s very important, and this is the what he chooses to lead with? What makes vilifying Ukraine so significant/important to him?</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Edit: It must be a personal matter to him, as it&#39;s difficult to explain otherwise. This stance seems unrelated to domestic politics. He previously attempted to depict Ukraine as anti-Christian in comparison to Russia, which is perplexing. If anything, Ukrainians are more akin to the small-town highly religious &#39;bumpkins&#39; than Russians are. The fact is that Ukraine is both: (1) more devoutly religious and more (2) Christian than Russia. He isn&#39;t using Ukraine to score points in domestic politics; rather, he&#39;s using domestic politics and misinformation about Ukraine to portray it as anti-Christian.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><sup><sup>On</sup> <sup>a</sup> <sup>personal</sup> <sup>note</sup> <sup>&amp;</sup> <sup>not</sup> <sup>claiming</sup> <sup>this</sup> <sup>as</sup> <sup>an</sup> <sup>objective</sup> <sup>fact:</sup> <sup>I</sup> <sup>regard</sup> <sup>Tucker</sup> <sup>as</sup> <sup>the</sup> <sup>2nd-most</sup> <sup>detrimental</sup> <sup>figure</sup> <sup>to</sup> <sup>Ukraine,</sup> <sup>just</sup> <sup>behind</sup> <sup>Putin.</sup> <sup>While</sup> <sup>I</sup> <sup>may</sup> <sup>be</sup> <sup>overlooking</sup> <sup>some</sup> <sup>of</sup> <sup>Putin&#39;s</sup> <sup>minions</sup> <sup>such</sup> <sup>as</sup> <sup>Shoigu,</sup> <sup>Gerasimov,</sup> <sup>or</sup> <sup>Solovyov,</sup> <sup>but</sup> <sup>I</sup> <sup>believe</sup> <sup>Tucker&#39;s</sup> <sup>anti-Ukraine</sup> <sup>stance</sup> <sup>poses</sup> <sup>a</sup> <sup>significantly</sup> <sup>greater</sup> <sup>threat</sup> <sup>to</sup> <sup>the</sup> <sup>survival</sup> <sup>of</sup> <sup>Ukraine</sup> <sup>than</sup> <sup>those</sup> <sup>clowns.</sup></sup></p>\n</div>",

These need to cover intelligence sharing, joint Ukraine training, enhanced ammunition production, Nato interoperability and a supply of arms sufficient to deter Russia from a further attack.\n\n>He said that \u201cafter a slow start, momentum was now building behind these ideas\u201d, including in France.\n\n>He said that \u201csome Nato allies might be in favour of the security guarantees to actually avoid a real discussion on Ukraine\u2019s membership aspirations. They hope that by providing security guarantees, they can avoid this question. I don\u2019t think that is possible. I think the Nato issue will be raised at the summit in Vilnius. I\u2019ve spoken with several eastern European leaders, and there is a group of hardcore, eastern central European allies that want at least a clear path for Ukraine towards Nato membership.\u201d\n\n>He said history showed it was dangerous to leave Ukraine in the Nato waiting room indefinitely. Even if an invitation to Ukraine to join Nato could not be provided at the Vilnius summit, the possibility of extending an invitation in Washington next year could be referenced. That path to membership, he said, should exclude setting preconditions such as a Nato membership action plan, something neither Sweden nor Finland have been required to adopt as part of their membership path.\n\n>\u201cAnything less than that would be a disappointment to Ukraine,\u201d he said.\n\n>He rejected the argument that Ukraine could not be offered a path to Nato membership until the war was over, saying this would provide Putin with a veto.\n\nProbably not surprising that Poland could seek out a coalition of the willing to intervene in Ukraine if it had to. After all, there\u2019s been [some in the Polish government](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/polish-ambassador-to-france-does-not-rule-out-direct-polish-intervention-in-ukraine-war/2850995) who\u2019ve suggested as such. Though this was rebuked quickly. \n\nUltimately, this is something that\u2018s still just speculation and would be far down the line, and would probably necessitate certain lines being crossed.

At the same time, Pegov swore that he saw a flag of the terrorist group Al-Qaeda next to the Azov Regiment&#39;s flags in Mariupol.[16] On July 6, 2022, Pegov published a false video in which he claimed that the Ukrainian army was using internationally banned methods of warfare and shelling territories with phosphorus munitions.[17]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not saying anything about how the counteroffensive is going, but i&#39;ll need more than a single grain of the salt</p>\n</div>",
