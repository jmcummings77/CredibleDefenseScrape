They have a history of their own defense industries designing and producing their own equipment or getting production of foreign equipment done in the country. \n\n[Santa B\u00e1rbara Sistemas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_B%C3%A1rbara_Sistemas) helped design the [Pizarro/ASCOD](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCOD) AFV and also did about 60% of the assembly of the [Leopard 2E](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopard_2E), which was sort of awkward when GDLS bought SBS. KMW and GDLS worked out it, though. GDELS also is where the [British Ajax](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_Ajax) hulls are produced, [a project that is going...well, is going.](https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/british-armys-greek-tragedy) The first 100 hulls were said to be not very well quality controlled. On a side note, GDLS used the ASCOD as the starting point for the M10 Booker, which was done much faster and successfully, [making at least one British defense analyst salty.](https://x.com/nicholadrummond/status/1750942000826769565?s=20) Expal Systems, the ammunition company that [Rheinmetall bought last year](https://www.rheinmetall.com/en/media/news-watch/news/2023/8/2023-08-01-rheinmetall-completes-acquisition-of-spanish-defence-contractor-expal-systems) was also a Spanish company. \n\nSpain also awarded a [$2.2bn contract toTESS Defence](https://www.thedefensepost.com/2023/12/29/spain-tess-defence-armored-vehicle/) to design and produce a replacement their 450 M113s. This new Veh\u00edculo de Apoyo de Cadenas (VAC) Tracked Support Vehicle is to be based on the [ASCOD](https://www.janes.com/defence-news/news-detail/favs-2023-spain-plans-to-sign-vac-tracked-support-vehicle-contract-by-end-of-year). Which makes sense because [Tess Defence](https://www.infodefensa.com/texto-diario/mostrar/4409850/asi-sera-blindado-espanol-basado-pizarro-sustituira-vetusto-m113-toa) is a Spanish consortium formed by Santa B\u00e1rbara Sistemas, Indra, Sapa Placencia, and Escribano Mechanical & Engineering. It is responsible for the [VCR8x8 Dragon](https://tess-defence.es/en/programa-vcr-8x8-dragon-2/) which is based off the [Piranha V and set to replace BMR-M1, VEC-M1, and some M113](https://armyrecognition.com/defense_news_june_2023_global_security_army_industry/spanish_ministry_of_defense_going_forward_with_vcr_8x8_dragon_program_as_production_progresses.html).\n\nLooking at them in context, their approach hasn't been to go it alone like France or Italy, but also not to completely outsource like many other European countries. They've struck a balance using cooperation or local production agreements to produce localized variants, which has worked out for them.\n\nIt makes sense that they'd want GDLES to invest more locally, especially with the Ajax, Pizarro, Dragon, and future VAC being produced in their country (also maybe the [Sabrah light tank hull](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabrah_Light_Tank), I'm not sure on that one). That's a lot of production and I'm sure Spain would love to see some of the design and research come over too. But it also makes sense why it's hard since GDELS isn't the top of the totem pole. What they should do is get the American ambassador to see if they can help get clearer lines of communication. The American government should be happy to see a GDLS subsidiary doing well, and want to try to keep that going without giving some other company an opportunity to move in more",

On a side note, GDLS used the ASCOD as the starting point for the M10 Booker, which was done much faster and successfully, <a href=\"https://x.com/nicholadrummond/status/1750942000826769565?s=20\">making at least one British defense analyst salty.</a> Expal Systems, the ammunition company that <a href=\"https://www.rheinmetall.com/en/media/news-watch/news/2023/8/2023-08-01-rheinmetall-completes-acquisition-of-spanish-defence-contractor-expal-systems\">Rheinmetall bought last year</a> was also a Spanish company. </p>\n\n<p>Spain also awarded a <a href=\"https://www.thedefensepost.com/2023/12/29/spain-tess-defence-armored-vehicle/\">$2.2bn contract toTESS Defence</a> to design and produce a replacement their 450 M113s. This new Veh\u00edculo de Apoyo de Cadenas (VAC) Tracked Support Vehicle is to be based on the <a href=\"https://www.janes.com/defence-news/news-detail/favs-2023-spain-plans-to-sign-vac-tracked-support-vehicle-contract-by-end-of-year\">ASCOD</a>. Which makes sense because <a href=\"https://www.infodefensa.com/texto-diario/mostrar/4409850/asi-sera-blindado-espanol-basado-pizarro-sustituira-vetusto-m113-toa\">Tess Defence</a> is a Spanish consortium formed by Santa B\u00e1rbara Sistemas, Indra, Sapa Placencia, and Escribano Mechanical &amp; Engineering. It is responsible for the <a href=\"https://tess-defence.es/en/programa-vcr-8x8-dragon-2/\">VCR8x8 Dragon</a> which is based off the <a href=\"https://armyrecognition.com/defense_news_june_2023_global_security_army_industry/spanish_ministry_of_defense_going_forward_with_vcr_8x8_dragon_program_as_production_progresses.html\">Piranha V and set to replace BMR-M1, VEC-M1, and some M113</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Looking at them in context, their approach hasn&#39;t been to go it alone like France or Italy, but also not to completely outsource like many other European countries. They&#39;ve struck a balance using cooperation or local production agreements to produce localized variants, which has worked out for them.</p>\n\n<p>It makes sense that they&#39;d want GDLES to invest more locally, especially with the Ajax, Pizarro, Dragon, and future VAC being produced in their country (also maybe the <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabrah_Light_Tank\">Sabrah light tank hull</a>, I&#39;m not sure on that one). That&#39;s a lot of production and I&#39;m sure Spain would love to see some of the design and research come over too. But it also makes sense why it&#39;s hard since GDELS isn&#39;t the top of the totem pole. What they should do is get the American ambassador to see if they can help get clearer lines of communication. The American government should be happy to see a GDLS subsidiary doing well, and want to try to keep that going without giving some other company an opportunity to move in more</p>\n</div>",

It relies on too many flawed assumptions.\n\nPrivate individuals have been trying to estimate loss rates based on this imagery since the beginning of the war. Russians know that, and also know that state actors are able to do the same thing and count the exact number by category with much better accuracy. Which begs the question of why they would still leave their entire stockpile out in the open so late into the war, rather than simply moving part of it to covered hangars or new bases that aren't yet known to the public, thereby obfuscating the data enough to make this sort of extrapolation impossible.\n\nThis is quite obvious when you compare the number of towed and self-propelled artillery supposedly withdrawn to Oryx loss data - the former is greater by a factor of 2 and 23 (!), respectively. The author argues that Oryx doesn't record every loss, which is true, but not by a sufficiently large factor (say, 2, 3 or 4) to change much to the calculation. As evidence of that, Oryx has recorded a bit under 200 2S19 losses, but their data has *more* 2S19 in storage than before the war, which suggests Russia has been able to fully replace their losses, and send the balance to storage. This suggests a production rate of around 100 a year. If Oryx had only recorded a third or half of the 2S19 losses, it would instead suggest a production capability of 200-300 a year, which I don't think Russia can achieve, at least not in 2022-2023.\n\nThey haven't been firing enough shells either for replacement barrels to be a plausible explanation as to why 7k+ towed artillery would've gone AWOL, especially in 2023, where the rate was fairly even with Ukraine's except at the very end of the year (but spread over more systems).",

The Bakhmut campaign made it worse, Prigozhin winning again made it worse, Prigozhin winning triggered the Shoigu contract order because Wagner wasn&#39;t needed anymore (they won) and that triggered the mutiny. </p>\n\n<p>Ergo, if the Ukrainians retreat earlier, and Wagner takes Bakhmut earlier, do you think that makes Shoigu happier or angrier?</p>\n</div>",

As the the war between the two countries is soon to enter a third year, Ukraine is focusing on targets that provide revenue to the Russian state and supply fuel to the Russian army.\n\n\n>Lukoil\u2019s Volgograd refinery, one of the nation\u2019s largest, processed almost 289,000 barrels a day of crude oil in the first 24 days of January, or more than 5% of Russia\u2019s total crude-processing volume, according to a person familiar with industry data.\n\n\n[Here](https://twitter.com/Maks_NAFO_FELLA/status/1753691150366449775) are some photos of the fire. Russia already has to [cut exports](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/russia-cuts-gasoline-diesel-exports-offset-refinery-outages-2024-01-31/):\n\n\n>Russian energy giant Novatek (NVTK.MM) on Jan. 21 was forced to suspend some operations at the huge Baltic Sea fuel export terminal at Ust-luga, as well as \"technological processes\" at a nearby fuel-producing complex, after a fire, started by what Ukrainian media said was a drone attack.\n\n\n>Russia will likely cut exports of naphtha by some 127,500-136,000 barrels per day, or around a third of its total exports, after fires disrupted operations at refineries on the Baltic and Black Seas, according to traders and LSEG ship-tracking data.\n\n\nWithout Western support, Ukraine would probably be even bolder, perhaps blockading all exports from nearby Russian ports. It would be a good idea for the rest of the world to make contingency plans in case this happens.\n\n\nThe Houthis are another wildcard. Supposedly they don't hit Russian goods, but [not all](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/traders-divert-russian-oil-products-around-africa-avoid-red-sea-sources-lseg-2024-01-31/) traders agree:\n\n\n>ince the full EU embargo on Russian oil products took effect in February 2023, traders have rerouted fuel oil, vacuum gasoil (VGO) and naphtha cargoes from Russian ports to Asia and the Middle East via the Red Sea and the Suez Canal as the shortest sea route.\n\n\n>According to LSEG shipping data, fuel oil and VGO loaded on two tankers Nissos Christiana and Alkinoos at the Russian Baltic ports, had turned around in the Mediterranean Sea and were skirting the coast of Africa on their way to India and Singapore.\n\n\nThis makes Russian oil [less competitive](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/indias-oil-imports-russia-hit-12-month-low-jan-sanctions-bite-2024-02-01/), especially on the Indian market:\n\n\n\n> \"The narrowing of Russian crude discounts versus Middle Eastern crude, recent U.S. sanctions on shipowners carrying Russian crude above the price cap and rising tanker premiums as a result of the Red Sea attacks have made Russian crude less attractive for Indian refiners in recent months,\" said Serena Huang, Vortexa's head of APAC analysis.\n\n\n>India's imports of Russian crude could fall further in the coming months, she added.",

Russia already has to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/russia-cuts-gasoline-diesel-exports-offset-refinery-outages-2024-01-31/\">cut exports</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Russian energy giant Novatek (NVTK.MM) on Jan. 21 was forced to suspend some operations at the huge Baltic Sea fuel export terminal at Ust-luga, as well as &quot;technological processes&quot; at a nearby fuel-producing complex, after a fire, started by what Ukrainian media said was a drone attack.</p>\n\n<p>Russia will likely cut exports of naphtha by some 127,500-136,000 barrels per day, or around a third of its total exports, after fires disrupted operations at refineries on the Baltic and Black Seas, according to traders and LSEG ship-tracking data.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Without Western support, Ukraine would probably be even bolder, perhaps blockading all exports from nearby Russian ports. It would be a good idea for the rest of the world to make contingency plans in case this happens.</p>\n\n<p>The Houthis are another wildcard. Supposedly they don&#39;t hit Russian goods, but <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/traders-divert-russian-oil-products-around-africa-avoid-red-sea-sources-lseg-2024-01-31/\">not all</a> traders agree:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>ince the full EU embargo on Russian oil products took effect in February 2023, traders have rerouted fuel oil, vacuum gasoil (VGO) and naphtha cargoes from Russian ports to Asia and the Middle East via the Red Sea and the Suez Canal as the shortest sea route.</p>\n\n<p>According to LSEG shipping data, fuel oil and VGO loaded on two tankers Nissos Christiana and Alkinoos at the Russian Baltic ports, had turned around in the Mediterranean Sea and were skirting the coast of Africa on their way to India and Singapore.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This makes Russian oil <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/indias-oil-imports-russia-hit-12-month-low-jan-sanctions-bite-2024-02-01/\">less competitive</a>, especially on the Indian market:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;The narrowing of Russian crude discounts versus Middle Eastern crude, recent U.S. sanctions on shipowners carrying Russian crude above the price cap and rising tanker premiums as a result of the Red Sea attacks have made Russian crude less attractive for Indian refiners in recent months,&quot; said Serena Huang, Vortexa&#39;s head of APAC analysis.</p>\n\n<p>India&#39;s imports of Russian crude could fall further in the coming months, she added.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Hell, the Super Hornet has now had a longer production life than the Hornet and the maintenance issues regarding availability of both of these aircraft are separate and distinct issues , especially considering USN F-18s went to the carrier, and the fatigue life of the Hornet and Rhino are rated on different things (such as the fact that the legacy F-18 famously has a lifetime carrier trap limit, which is not a thing on the Rhino).\n\nThe classic F-18 (as the RAAF calls it) is indeed older/lower lot amongst the production lots of the legacy Hornet (being based on the original F-18A/B), but they had various upgrades to them throughout their life all the way to the end. [Their upgrade program went through 2017](https://www.australiandefence.com.au/defence/air/air-force-farewells-hornets), with retirement coming in 2021.\n\nThe [Canadians are currently buying the APG-79(V)4 GaN AESA](https://www.twz.com/42501/its-official-canadas-cf-18-hornet-fighters-are-set-to-get-new-advanced-radars) for their CF-18s (which includes the Australian F-18s that have been updated), along with software upgrades, to keep them in a similar baseline to the USMC F-18s which are still currently receiving upgrades.\n\n>That is, all three of the RAAF, CAF, and USN are all rather certain theyre going to move up to the F-35. The CAF was going to join the F-35 program early on, then the government backed out, then they wanted to get back in. They should have been along with the British one of the first recipients, but AFAIK they still havn't gotten their airframes because the whole thing has been a goat\n\nWhich they lucked out in, because instead of buying a bunch of Block 2 or Block 3 configured F-35s, they can jump in to brand new Block 4 F-35s whenever Lockheed gets its head out of its ass and actually delivers combat-capable planes. For a nation crunched by budgetary issues, it'll cost less than trying to maintain and upgrade a bunch of early lot Block 2 and 3 F-35s, as we've found out.\n\n>In each case, as the F-35 has hove into view as a 'will acquire' system, the F-18s were moved into legacy mode. New airframe buys stopped, longterm maintenance was reduced or canceled, and air hours were kept high to 'use up' as much life as possible out of them. The goal being to make sure the planes were good and finished with their practical service life as the F-35 entered service, both from an economy standpoint (we got our moneys worth) and a political standpoint (these aircraft need to be replaced).

The entire reason the F-16A MLUs are being given away by Norway, Denmark, etc. is precisely because those nations are currently transitioning to the F-35 and can give away their F-16A MLUs. Without the transition, it would not have been possible. So your same argument would work against where those F-16s are coming from, which is clearly not stopping their transfer.\n\nAnd as I wrote, nations actively upgrade their planes to near the end of their lives. Obviously, no one is making major investments a year or two out, but if you care about your military (and the Australians absolutely do), you typically you want to wrap up the last larger upgrades by 3-5 years prior to the last one flying. \n\n>And in the Canadian case, the CAF is doubly f'd because they stretched existing airframes beyond even what they wanted as a result of the delayed F-35 transition.\n\nWhich the RAAF helped them out with by transferring them their retired airframes. The RAAF also gave up birds to the US so USMC now has a healthy fleet to fly (USN has also retired theirs). End result is that both RCAF and USMC are quite healthy right now, actually.\n\nIn fact, remember when the [RAAF was about to sell their legacy F-18s](https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/defense/2020-03-05/air-usa-buys-former-raaf-hornets) to Air USA, a private contractor firm trying to start its own adversary/aggressor services?\n\nGuess why there's been no mention of Air USA anymore and legacy F-18s being aggressors? Something made that sale fall through, right?\n\nBecause, fun fact: the US has the final say in where our FMS birds get sent. There are stipulations when a nation buys. We actively blocked the RAAF F-18s from being sold to a private corporation, and instead negotiated their transfer to RCAF and USMC. \n\nEven if Ukraine wanted the RAAF F-18s, they would have had to go through the US first. The US has agreed for European nations to give up their F-16s first (and not even from our own stockpile) to Ukraine, while we have taken the F-18s back or given to them our allies.\n\n>So I get why the Ukrainians were not excited about the -18, which is a lower production rate plane than the -16, is being phased out by nearly every major user, has (at least in the non-super legacy configuration) reached the limit of useful airframe life, and is not generally what theyre looking for.\n\nFrankly, the Ukrainians have no freaking idea what they are talking about, which shouldn't be surprising for an Air Force still dominated by ex-Soviet tactics and mindset. \n\nNot only is there currently a fair bit of F-18 parts available precisely because the USN and RAAF retired hundreds of their legacy F-18s recently (while the USAF is keeping the F-16 around longer, hence only European countries are giving F-16s to Ukraine), but a bunch of people who have no idea what each jet is capable of (APG-73 vs. APG-66 or -68, what weapons are integrated for each FMS nation, etc.) is hilarity.\n\n[The RAAF F-18s](https://alert5.com/2023/06/06/talks-are-underway-to-donate-raaf-f-a-18a-bs-to-ukraine/) all had APG-73s, LITENING pod integration, Link 16, JHMCS, etc. as far back as the *2000s*. [Depending on what tape the F-16 MLUs](https://www.f-16.net/f-16_versions_article2.html) were upgraded to, which depended on what tape the nations bought (and if they bought the associated hardware), they could have similar or worse capabilities. Some of those pieces on the F-16 came in much later than when they did on the F-18, as well.\n\n>The F-16 is a more viable platform longterm and is still being actively developed and upgraded.\n\nWhich, as I've wrote, isn't necessarily true since the F-18s are still receiving upgrades. Also, as I mentioned, it entirely depends on which FMS country bought what upgrades. A Danish F-16 MLU rocking an APG-66 running MMC software isn't going to have the same config or capability as a Block 30 USANG F-16 with an APG-83 and CDU, running an entirely different branch of software, for instance.  \n\n>Even if I am a big fan of the -18, and its my favorite module in DCS, the -16 is a clearer winner here. Where it falls apart a bit is the decision to wait a year to get -16s rather than push hard to get -18s now.

The fact that Ukraine waited to get a better deal suggests either that they badly played their hand, probably true, or also that theyre not as needed/wont be as impactful as the general public has been lead to believe.\n\nThe vast vast majority of military fighter pilots that have commented on this online have been very \"ehh.... good luck\" whenever the talk about Ukrainian F-16s gets brought up.

The US has agreed for European nations to give up their F-16s first (and not even from our own stockpile) to Ukraine, while we have taken the F-18s back or given to them our allies.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>So I get why the Ukrainians were not excited about the -18, which is a lower production rate plane than the -16, is being phased out by nearly every major user, has (at least in the non-super legacy configuration) reached the limit of useful airframe life, and is not generally what theyre looking for.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Frankly, the Ukrainians have no freaking idea what they are talking about, which shouldn&#39;t be surprising for an Air Force still dominated by ex-Soviet tactics and mindset. </p>\n\n<p>Not only is there currently a fair bit of F-18 parts available precisely because the USN and RAAF retired hundreds of their legacy F-18s recently (while the USAF is keeping the F-16 around longer, hence only European countries are giving F-16s to Ukraine), but a bunch of people who have no idea what each jet is capable of (APG-73 vs. APG-66 or -68, what weapons are integrated for each FMS nation, etc.) is hilarity.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://alert5.com/2023/06/06/talks-are-underway-to-donate-raaf-f-a-18a-bs-to-ukraine/\">The RAAF F-18s</a> all had APG-73s, LITENING pod integration, Link 16, JHMCS, etc. as far back as the <em>2000s</em>. <a href=\"https://www.f-16.net/f-16_versions_article2.html\">Depending on what tape the F-16 MLUs</a> were upgraded to, which depended on what tape the nations bought (and if they bought the associated hardware), they could have similar or worse capabilities. Some of those pieces on the F-16 came in much later than when they did on the F-18, as well.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The F-16 is a more viable platform longterm and is still being actively developed and upgraded.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Which, as I&#39;ve wrote, isn&#39;t necessarily true since the F-18s are still receiving upgrades. Also, as I mentioned, it entirely depends on which FMS country bought what upgrades. A Danish F-16 MLU rocking an APG-66 running MMC software isn&#39;t going to have the same config or capability as a Block 30 USANG F-16 with an APG-83 and CDU, running an entirely different branch of software, for instance.  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Even if I am a big fan of the -18, and its my favorite module in DCS, the -16 is a clearer winner here. Where it falls apart a bit is the decision to wait a year to get -16s rather than push hard to get -18s now. My feeling is that if the air war were as dire as some have said, or if the capabilities of an American fighter were thought to be so overwhelming, they would have moved faster on whatever they could get. The capability gap in an old F-18 vs. -16 is not huge. The fact that Ukraine waited to get a better deal suggests either that they badly played their hand, probably true, or also that theyre not as needed/wont be as impactful as the general public has been lead to believe.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The vast vast majority of military fighter pilots that have commented on this online have been very &quot;ehh.... good luck&quot; whenever the talk about Ukrainian F-16s gets brought up. Take with that what you will.</p>\n\n<p>edit: link</p>\n</div>",

Starting with New Zealand and AUKUS:\n\n>[New Zealand Takes Step Toward Joining Aukus Security Pact](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-01/new-zealand-takes-step-toward-joining-aukus-security-pact?srnd=null)\n\n>* Australia set to send officials to Wellington for discussions\n>* Pact largely targets China\u2019s perceived military assertiveness\n\n\n>New Zealand has agreed to officially explore the potential benefits of joining the Aukus pact, the latest sign that Wellington will contribute to the security agreement mainly aimed at countering China.\n\n>Australia will send a team of officials to New Zealand soon to discuss pillar two of Aukus, which relates to cooperation in strategically sensitive areas including quantum computing and artificial intelligence, the foreign affairs and defense minsters of both countries said after meetings in Melbourne on Thursday. The other members of Aukus are the US and the UK.\n\n>\u201cAustralian officials have been asked to work together with New Zealand officials to see some of the opportunities that are available in Aukus Two for New Zealand,\u201d Judith Collins, New Zealand\u2019s defense minister, said at a joint news conference. \u201cThe opportunities that are open to our space and technology sectors are actually immense.\u201d\n\n>The Aukus pact, signed in September 2021, has largely made headlines for the first pillar, in which London and Washington agreed to help Canberra field its own fleet of nuclear-powered submarines by the 2040s. New Zealand, which has a nuclear-free policy, is only interested in pillar two.\n\n>New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon previously expressed interest in exploring the benefits that Aukus pillar two could bring to his country. During his first visit to Australia as leader in December, Luxon said the security accord was an \u201cimportant element\u201d to ensuring peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\n>Other nations including Japan have also expressed interest in pillar two.\n\nNow, reminder that there have been reports of SK's preliminary interest in joining AUKUS and acquiring its own nuclear submarines after NK tested a SLBM last year. And that case would be helped by:\n\n>[North Korea tests more cruise missiles as leader Kim calls for war readiness](https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-warships-kim-jong-un-7b95a61efb1b099b6b9142369d465629)\n\n>North Korea on Friday extended a provocative series of weapons tests by firing cruise missiles into the sea, as leader Kim Jong Un called for his military to step up war preparations and toured a shipyard.\n\n>South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the U.S. and South Korean militaries were analyzing the North Korean launches into its western sea. It said South Korea\u2019s military detected multiple missiles but it did not immediately provide a specific number or an assessment of their flights.\n\n>The launches, which were North Korea\u2019s fourth round of cruise missile tests in 2024, came hours after state media reported that Kim reiterated his focus on strengthening his naval forces as he inspected unspecified naval projects at a shipyard in Nampho on the west coast.\n\nIs this just bluster? Is it anything more serious?

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Outside of the usual hotspots, there&#39;s a lot of other stuff happening in the globe. Starting with New Zealand and AUKUS:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-01/new-zealand-takes-step-toward-joining-aukus-security-pact?srnd=null\">New Zealand Takes Step Toward Joining Aukus Security Pact</a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Australia set to send officials to Wellington for discussions</li>\n<li>Pact largely targets China\u2019s perceived military assertiveness</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>New Zealand has agreed to officially explore the potential benefits of joining the Aukus pact, the latest sign that Wellington will contribute to the security agreement mainly aimed at countering China.</p>\n\n<p>Australia will send a team of officials to New Zealand soon to discuss pillar two of Aukus, which relates to cooperation in strategically sensitive areas including quantum computing and artificial intelligence, the foreign affairs and defense minsters of both countries said after meetings in Melbourne on Thursday. The other members of Aukus are the US and the UK.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAustralian officials have been asked to work together with New Zealand officials to see some of the opportunities that are available in Aukus Two for New Zealand,\u201d Judith Collins, New Zealand\u2019s defense minister, said at a joint news conference. \u201cThe opportunities that are open to our space and technology sectors are actually immense.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The Aukus pact, signed in September 2021, has largely made headlines for the first pillar, in which London and Washington agreed to help Canberra field its own fleet of nuclear-powered submarines by the 2040s. New Zealand, which has a nuclear-free policy, is only interested in pillar two.</p>\n\n<p>New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon previously expressed interest in exploring the benefits that Aukus pillar two could bring to his country. During his first visit to Australia as leader in December, Luxon said the security accord was an \u201cimportant element\u201d to ensuring peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>\n\n<p>Other nations including Japan have also expressed interest in pillar two.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now, reminder that there have been reports of SK&#39;s preliminary interest in joining AUKUS and acquiring its own nuclear submarines after NK tested a SLBM last year. And that case would be helped by:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-warships-kim-jong-un-7b95a61efb1b099b6b9142369d465629\">North Korea tests more cruise missiles as leader Kim calls for war readiness</a></p>\n\n<p>North Korea on Friday extended a provocative series of weapons tests by firing cruise missiles into the sea, as leader Kim Jong Un called for his military to step up war preparations and toured a shipyard.</p>\n\n<p>South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the U.S. and South Korean militaries were analyzing the North Korean launches into its western sea. It said South Korea\u2019s military detected multiple missiles but it did not immediately provide a specific number or an assessment of their flights.</p>\n\n<p>The launches, which were North Korea\u2019s fourth round of cruise missile tests in 2024, came hours after state media reported that Kim reiterated his focus on strengthening his naval forces as he inspected unspecified naval projects at a shipyard in Nampho on the west coast.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Is this just bluster?

If indeed the Houthis avoid ships with any connection to China (not very informed on what that would mean so correct me here) then the Chinese could just let them at it if they deem the calculation in their favour, everything I read these days makes them sound like they aren't taking sides so they could be indeed hoping this keeps on happening so it degrades US influence in the region.

The Americans are obviously forced to act or lose face but at the same time can't act decisively because of internal politics , a decisive reaction would be crippling iranian influence outside Iran completely. I am uncertain on whether hitting  Iran itself is a good idea , cause why unite a semi fractured country ? Completely destroy all proxies and their ability to influence events. Instead,  the US is choosing half measures in yemen and seems to be pushing Israel to accept a horrible deal in gaza that would embolden not only Iran and it's proxies but also China.\n\nAnother curiosity , I mentioned in the previous paragraph that 'The Americans are obviously forced to act or lose face ' but is that accurate? That is the gist of it in my mind but I honestly have no idea. Why did they actually act? Why bomb the Houthis if you don't actually solve the issue?  I doubt that they thought they would prevent them from launching by doing a couple of strikes that they let everyone know would happen. Why show yourself incompetent almost on purpose? If you can't get  a bigger coalition willing to go on the offense with you just wait until the issue gets so big that they beg you for help. I guess I would understand it if Israel was the only one taking the hit but is Israel affected that much by this blockade? More than Egypt for example and what about the EU countries? I know they are way more conflict averse but at some point I assume they would either feel pressured enough to do something or just beg the US to do something. Someone wrote something very accurate  yesterday I believe. I don't remember who it was but the gist of the point is that the US is a status-quo power. A current superpower that attempts above all to keep the situation as it is since it's what is best for itself. A superpower of course can never really take a back seat and always has to let people know who is in charge, maybe that is a recipe for bad strategic decisions in the end?",

Instead,  the US is choosing half measures in yemen and seems to be pushing Israel to accept a horrible deal in gaza that would embolden not only Iran and it&#39;s proxies but also China.</p>\n\n<p>Another curiosity , I mentioned in the previous paragraph that &#39;The Americans are obviously forced to act or lose face &#39; but is that accurate? That is the gist of it in my mind but I honestly have no idea. Why did they actually act? Why bomb the Houthis if you don&#39;t actually solve the issue?  I doubt that they thought they would prevent them from launching by doing a couple of strikes that they let everyone know would happen. Why show yourself incompetent almost on purpose? If you can&#39;t get  a bigger coalition willing to go on the offense with you just wait until the issue gets so big that they beg you for help. I guess I would understand it if Israel was the only one taking the hit but is Israel affected that much by this blockade? More than Egypt for example and what about the EU countries? I know they are way more conflict averse but at some point I assume they would either feel pressured enough to do something or just beg the US to do something. Someone wrote something very accurate  yesterday I believe. I don&#39;t remember who it was but the gist of the point is that the US is a status-quo power. A current superpower that attempts above all to keep the situation as it is since it&#39;s what is best for itself. A superpower of course can never really take a back seat and always has to let people know who is in charge, maybe that is a recipe for bad strategic decisions in the end?</p>\n</div>",

Lots of units have their own websites and recruitment efforts, performing their own basic training, etc, with some more popular than others. And with some so successful (Like the various Azov formations) that they don't or barely need to tap into conscripted troops for manpower. \n\nWhen it comes to conscription, its VERY confusing, due to Ukraine's laws. Basically anyone from 18-60 can be called up, and they have annual conscription too, which could conscript 18 year olds and above. However, they have another law regarding mobilization, which is how they are currently inducting troops, and that has quite a lot of deferments. The current age limit is 27 years and older, with nobody with three children or more, no single parents, no parents of disabled children, no one currently holding an elected office in their parliament, nobody attending any sort of college degree program, and a few other rather insane deferments created prewar that were deliberately meant to limit the number of people who might be forced to serve (popularist measures). \n\nUkraine has demographic issues triggered by the collapse of the Soviet Union and the large numbers of young people who emigrated in the 1990s and 2000s. The smallest military aged male population are those in their late teens and into the early to late 20s, and yet those are the most critical to serve as they make the best soldiers. The Ukrainians are will aware of their demographic issues, hence why they've performed measures trying to save their younger generations, but their mobilization issues are in such a crisis that they don't really have a choice. If they use their 18-29 year olds as soldiers and they die, Ukraine can damage their future. But if they don't make recruitment numbers, they will have no future. \n\nSince the war broke out, the Ukrainian govt have talked a great deal about steps to correct some of the various laws involving mobilization, such as lowering the mobilization age from 27 to 25 years old, limiting the number of deferments, etc. \n\nBut almost none have either passed the Verkhovna Rada, and those that did weren't signed by Zelensky. \n\nSince mid-November, Zelensky has been under heavy pressure for a major mobilization reform to both increase the overall pool of eligible candidates, to allow existing troops who have been serving for 3 years or more to be discharged, etc. But nothing has come of it. \n\nPart of that discussion revolves on the number of troops they will need, and supposedly it's a range of 400-500,000 new troops. \n\nHowever, Zelensky says that Zaluzhny and the UAF provided him that number (and they deny it), while Zelensky is also uncommital while saying he wants further research and debate within the Verkhovna Rada before he involves himself in the discussion. \n\nRealistically, Ukraine needs to, at a minimum, replace the troops that are lost as casualties, accidents, and desertions; those would largely be combat arms troops in the Ukrainian Ground Forces, Air Assault Forces, Territorial Defense Forces, and Special Operations Forces, mostly junior enlisted and junior officers, mostly infantry. That number comes down to monthly losses. I wont provide numbers for those, since even the UA govt and military deem those state secrets, and any number provided it pure speculation. \n\nAdditionally, they will still need to build more units, as the demand for unit rotation only increases as the force grows in size, so they'll need more troops of all types for that, of all ranks. That number varies immensely in terms of what they need/want to build, and what they can supply. IE, they can't built more tank brigades if they don't have more tanks to equip them, etc. \n\nMeanwhile, they will eventually need to start rotating out at least temporarily, maybe permanently, maybe discharging those who are already serving, to not only limit the negative effects of PTSD, but primarily to act as a morale boost for recruitment and sustainment: If troops think they will serve continuously until they are casualties, that's very depressing and few are eager. If they believe their \"tour of duty\" will end, it's more accepting for them to do their time. However, that will be exceptionally hard to accomplish, since so much of the existing force structure would already fall into that category, too many to be able to start discharging troops beyond a trickle. \n\nCurrently, the last law that the Verkhovna Rada have been pushing is to try to discharge those who have served for 36 months. So that is the last crop of conscripts who were inducted a year before the invasion and then have served since. Prewar, conscript service was only 12-18 months, so they are quite overdo. However, even in that law that is being proposed, its more of a suggestion to discharge them if its possible, they're not outright saying they will (again, doing it at this point will be next to impossible). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Lastly, how much would this matter if the Ukrainians aren't getting what they need in terms of ammo, armor, aircraft, and whatever else they're saying they need?\n\nNot enough by a long shot. They don't even have the money to pay these new people. They barely have enough money to pay the existing people.  \n\nAnd considering the existing major problems finding motivated, eligible conscripts, increasing the demand will new legislation will increase the numbers of unwilling conscripts too, who will need to be incentivized to serve otherwise the pressganging efforts will grow and need to become the norm. \n\nPaying them more is the easiest way to incentivize new troops to serve, and yet its the hardest for Ukraine to perform because they're broke, which means Western supporters need to provide the funding to allow Ukraine to essentially bribe people to allow themselves to be conscripted. \n\nOther ways include going onto the strategic defensive while fortifying the front lines on a greater scale, which means theoretically fewer casualties as they would be better protected and not expected to go on the attack as much, if at all.

He also recognised the Russian \"Achilles heel\" - the weakness of the radio-electronic basis/foundation (presumably the scientific-technical backwardness of the Russian electronics industry).\n\nHowever, he hinted that Russia was catching up in this area - i.e. making faster progress than the enemy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**Putin discussed with the General Staff the difficulties caused by UAVs in one of the areas in the Special Military Operation zone**  \n>  \n>https://ta s s. ru/armiya-i-opk/19886729  \n>  \n>Russian President Vladimir Putin said that in the morning he spoke with the General Staff, they said that there were difficulties due to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in one of the areas in the SMO zone. The head of state spoke about this at a meeting with participants of the \u201cEverything for Victory!\u201d forum.  \n>  \n>\u201cI just spoke with the General Staff in the morning: in one of the areas, of course, the complexity of the situation is connected precisely with unmanned aerial vehicles,\u201d Putin said. He noted that from daily contacts with the military, with the guys who are fighting directly on the front line, he draws a conclusion about the importance of drones.  \n>  \n>One of the meeting participants told the president that with the beginning of the SMO, a group of microelectronics and programming enthusiasts developed and began to produce devices for detecting and comprehensively suppressing UAVs. He asked for the opportunity to integrate his activities into a project for the development of Russian electronics and gain access to the component base. Putin promised to provide assistance and instructed Deputy Prime Minister - Minister of Industry and Trade Denis Manturov to deal with this issue. \u201cWhat you are doing is extremely important. And, of course, we need to help you. Denis Valentinovich Manturov is here, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry. We are now investing most of our money in the revival of microelectronics. Not just radio electronics, but microelectronics,\u201d - Putin said.  \n>  \n>He added that there are relevant research institutions in this area that work effectively and achieve good results.

He also recognised the Russian &quot;Achilles heel&quot; - the weakness of the radio-electronic basis/foundation (presumably the scientific-technical backwardness of the Russian electronics industry).</p>\n\n<p>However, he hinted that Russia was catching up in this area - i.e. making faster progress than the enemy.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Putin discussed with the General Staff the difficulties caused by UAVs in one of the areas in the Special Military Operation zone</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>https://ta s s. ru/armiya-i-opk/19886729  </p>\n\n<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin said that in the morning he spoke with the General Staff, they said that there were difficulties due to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in one of the areas in the SMO zone. The head of state spoke about this at a meeting with participants of the \u201cEverything for Victory!\u201d forum.  </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI just spoke with the General Staff in the morning: in one of the areas, of course, the complexity of the situation is connected precisely with unmanned aerial vehicles,\u201d Putin said. He noted that from daily contacts with the military, with the guys who are fighting directly on the front line, he draws a conclusion about the importance of drones.  </p>\n\n<p>One of the meeting participants told the president that with the beginning of the SMO, a group of microelectronics and programming enthusiasts developed and began to produce devices for detecting and comprehensively suppressing UAVs. He asked for the opportunity to integrate his activities into a project for the development of Russian electronics and gain access to the component base. Putin promised to provide assistance and instructed Deputy Prime Minister - Minister of Industry and Trade Denis Manturov to deal with this issue. \u201cWhat you are doing is extremely important. And, of course, we need to help you. Denis Valentinovich Manturov is here, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry. We are now investing most of our money in the revival of microelectronics. Not just radio electronics, but microelectronics,\u201d - Putin said.  </p>\n\n<p>He added that there are relevant research institutions in this area that work effectively and achieve good results.

If you want to make the comparison a lot more fair, you adjust for purchasing power; though that has its own issues, since it then normalizes the costs of things you either don't or can't produce domestically and are only available at market exchange rates. So usually a better marker is to combine market exchange rates and also the ones adjusted for purchasing power; then take some middle of those two. That puts Russia closer to Germany's level.\n\nBut even that isn't perfect, because if we take Germany for example; the cost of your average German is much higher than the cost of your average Russian. Insurance rates are a good measure of this, and you can look at the pre-war ones; Russia has about 5-10x lower life insurance rates than EU countries; and that's taking the average. When you take out Moscow/St.Petersburg out of the equation the differences are stark.  So for purposes of producing manpower for the front, Russia is uniquely positioned.\n\nAll of that said, there's another thing to consider; the whole of west with the exception of US and *maybe* France/UK have heavily divested from military procurement in the last ~30 years(oh and I guess Sweden/Finland fit here too).
