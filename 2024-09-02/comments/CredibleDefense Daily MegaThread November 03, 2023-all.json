As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

Look at photos of when a CVN does a RAS - they largely clear out Hangar 3 (the aft hangar) and move aircraft on deck into locations to make it conducive to move ordnance, fuel, and supplies. It all but eliminates flight ops, sans for helicopters\n\nA LHA with limited stores/space for ordnance and even less flight deck has to get rid of aircraft in their tiny hangar decks (which limits how many aircraft can be carried, unless you like chucking aircraft overboard), and with that limited space, it has to resupply extremely frequently to sustain said ops.\n\n>Low survivability seems a bit silly since it's not like a carrier can defend itself outside of the ships that protect it.\n\nLow survivability includes, as the retired CAPT in that article wrote, the ability to survive fires. Fires can be caused from things that can occur without any enemy fire: such as from accidents. More aircraft on board than can be easily accommodated increases the odds of mishaps.  Increased op tempo and combat stress increases the odds of mishaps. Ordnance not stored properly in order to cram more on board can lead to disaster. Did you know that ships can set HERO (Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance) conditions? Imagine turning all your radars and systems on and accidentally causing ordnance to arm when they weren't supposed to. Oof.\n\nMoreover, your statement ignores that a carrier CAN defend itself outside of the ships that protect it: its aircraft protect it. In fact, the aircraft are the primary defenders of a ship.\n\nYou can't ID or escort an enemy aircraft with a missile. You can put aircraft much further from the carrier than an escort can reach with a missile - and said aircraft can look beyond the radar horizon of said ships.\n\nAll the issues above: lack of airborne C2 assets, lack of sortie rate, lack of support assets like tankers, etc. all result in next to no survivability from the air, making you entirely reliant on ships to defend yourself - which history has shown is a really sketchy prospect.\n\nLet's put it this way: how many F-35B's can you keep sustained airborne at a time with 16 jets and no tankers? Assuming that all 16 jets are mission capable and flyable (which never happens), and say you wanted to set a CAP 300 miles from the carrier. The F-35B's published STO combat radius is 450 miles w/ 2 1000 lb. JDAM and 2 AIM-120. That's flying a max range profile. Let's remove those two JDAM and put two more AIM-120s, and 2 AIM-9X's on the wingtips, so weights  are similar (so similar burn rates).\n\nYou'd be flying at a max range profile (most efficient way to go a distance) then having endurance on station which isn't going to be too too far off the the time it takes to fly the remaining 150 miles round trip for the combat radius. Let's say max range at the most efficient altitude (in the mid 30s) gets you 300 miles in about 30-40 minutes. \n\nBut for max time on station, you have to reserve gas to actually fight, because fighting at max endurance airspeed (which is slower than max range, and is not a tactical airspeed) is a pretty bad idea.\n\nSo in reality, you've got what? About 10-20 minutes of time on station + fuel to fight if required, so maybe 20-30 if you see nothing going on (a more relaxed posture) for maximum time on station?\n\nThen you have to head back home and land - which is another 30-40 minutes back.\n\nSo for a 1.5 hour mission, you might get 20-30 minutes on station. So for every 2 aircraft you send up, you basically have 2 RTB, and 2 en route to relieve. But those 2 that just launched need another 2 turning/starting up (a typical jet cold start takes 15-30 minutes before launch) to be ready to launch when those 2 outbound are on station and before those 2 coming home have recovered.\n\nSo that's 8 out of the 16 jets ready to just sustain 2 out on CAP at 300 miles from the ship. The 2 that are RTB that need to be refueled to go again. If you're lucky, they didn't find any malfunctions or issues that ground those 2 recovering jets. And if your deck crew are proficient, you might cycle those 2 aircraft straight into the next launch, but you can only do that so long before said jets need to be serviced for other things (like oil).\n\nHow long can you keep said CAP persistent in a 24 hour day? Do you shift to a 12 hour fly day and have limited amounts available the other 12 hours?\n\nSee how quickly a carrier with no tanker support (which could keep said aircraft on CAP out for an hour or longer), small # of jets (if you had 30 aircraft available on deck that are flyable, like a CVN, you could sustain a lot lot more aircraft), or airborne C2/AEW (like I don't know, an E-2D with 3x more endurance and sensor coverage over a gigantic piece of the Earth) rapidly becomes less survivable?\n\nHell, if a single tanker that can keep those 2 aircraft available on CAP for an hour, you've REDUCED the number of aircraft you need available, since you don't have to launch and recover aircraft as frequently; you can space out the oncoming fighter and tankers much more. Two fighters and a tanker is a lot less aircraft than keeping 6 flying to keep 2 on station.\n\nAlso, the E-2D now has aerial refueling capability, which means aircrew fatigue is going to be a limit before it runs out of fuel... so you could just send one aircraft airborne and launch aircraft only when you need to. Again, see how drastically things change when you don't have those specialist/support aircraft available on hand, to say nothing about what happens when you want to go on the *offensive*\n\nUSN has done multiple studies of this over the years, and there's a reason a CVL concept never takes off. The USMC can experiment all they want (even though USN has tried to reduce its number of amphibs... Marines might be willing to sail into the teeth of enemy defenses, but USN has to man it with its sailors) to justify their doctrine, but USN has lots of experience and already knows what the answer will be\n\nedit: also, seriously, read the article. It provides lots of numbers to chew at:\n\n>Also, if the Americas carry more strike aircraft, the supply of ordnance will have to grow accordingly. Why? The size of ordnance magazines for the Americas is based on the design of the amphibious assault ship USS Makin Island (LHD-8), which supports six Harriers providing close air support for one week of amphibious assault. A Gerald R. Ford- or a Nimitz-class carrier\u2019s magazines, in contrast, are more than 23 times larger to support 60 strike-fighters for two weeks. Twenty F-35B strike-fighters will quickly exhaust an America\u2019s ordnance, which begs the question: Where will the extra ordnance be stowed? Stowing it in the hangar bay or vehicle stowage is a bad idea. If there is no extra space for stowage, how often will they have to conduct vertical replenishment? How long will that take?

Tensions are already high on Israel\u2019s border with Lebanon, Hezbollah\u2019s base and from where it\u2019s exchanging fire with the Israeli military on a daily basis.\n\n>\u201cSpillover into Syria is not just a risk; it has already begun,\u201d Geir Pedersen, the United Nations special envoy for the country, said this week. \u201cFuel is being added to a tinderbox that was already beginning to ignite.\u201d>\n\n>Over the last decade, Syria became a global battleground. The US has almost 1,0>00 troops there to counter Islamist extremists and Turkey is fighting Kurdish groups in the north. Iran and Russia, meanwhile, are helping President Bashar al-Assad stay in power. Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed, and millions forced to flee.\n\n>Today, all-out war has been replaced by more sporadic fighting but the conflict in Israel-Gaza is exacerbating tensions.\n\n>On Oct. 30, Israeli warplanes bombed a Syrian military base in the southern province of Daraa. That was after Israel had dropped leaflets warning Syrian forces against allowing Iran and its proxies to operate near the border with Israel, according to the people familiar with the situation.\n\n>Five days earlier, Israel struck a weapons depot at a large Syrian base in the south, where Iranian officers and operatives from its proxy Hezbollah are embedded with Syrian forces. The attack killed more than a dozen Syrian soldiers and officers, according to the people. Israeli warplanes also hit air surveillance radars at a nearby facility, they added.\n\n>Members of the Russian military police are occasionally present at a facility next to this base. It\u2019s unclear if they were there when Israel struck. The Syrian military acknowledged both attacks.\n\n>Israel did not notify Russia in advance of the strikes, said the people who spoke about them.\n\n>And in the past three weeks, Israel struck Syria\u2019s main two airports in Damascus and Aleppo several times, putting them out of service and forcing civilian aircraft to land in the Russian airbase in Hmeimim on Syria\u2019s Mediterranean coast instead, said the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.\n\n>Israel has for years routinely struck targets in Syria, mainly to thwart Hezbollah militants there or secure its own north-eastern border. Since Russia intervened in the Syrian war in 2015, it\u2019s coordinated with Israel to ensure their forces don\u2019t clash or mistakenly fire on each other.\n\n>Israel\u2019s Defense Ministry declined to comment on the recent lack of warnings or whether leaflets were dropped on Syrian forces ahead of Monday\u2019s strike.\n\n>Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said his forces were determined to stop Iran ferrying weapons through Syria to neighboring Lebanon, where Hezbollah is based.\n\n>\u201cWe will not allow a new Hezbollah front there or permit an Iranian military presence in Syria,\u201d he told reporters Tuesday.\n\n>Hamas and Hezbollah receive extensive funding and training from Iran. They\u2019re both designated as terrorist groups by the US.\n\n>The Israeli warnings to Russia served both countries. Five years ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin assured Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu he would do everything to prevent Iran and Hezbollah from gaining a foothold in southwest Syria, across from the Israeli occupied Golan Heights.\n\n>But after Russia sent troops into Ukraine in 2022, Moscow tightened its alliance with Iran, straining relations with Israel. The war against Hamas, which rules Gaza and is also backed by Iran, and the deep cooperation between Israel and the US have driven the two even further apart.\n\n>The US has moved two aircraft carriers to the region since Oct. 7, when Hamas militants swarmed southern Israeli communities and killed 1,400 people, many of them children. Washington stood by Israel as it launched a mass of airstrikes on Gaza and started a ground offensive. Russia has criticized Israel\u2019s actions, which Hamas-led authorities say have killed more than 9,000 people.\n\n>Israel condemned Moscow for hosting a delegation from Hamas and Iran\u2019s deputy foreign minister last week.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-03/israel-russia-ties-worsen-as-it-fights-iran-proxies-in-syria-amid-war-with-hamas?srnd=politics-vp\">Israel\u2019s Fight With Iran Proxies in Syria Poisons Russia Ties</a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Israel steps up Syria strikes and isn\u2019t always warning Russia</li>\n<li>Strikes may also turn Syria into new front in Israel-Hamas war</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Since it went to war with Hamas early last month, Israel has stepped up strikes against Iran-backed militias in Syria which have moved close to the Israeli border.</p>\n\n<p>The development comes with a key shift in Israeli policy \u2014 it no longer always warns Syria\u2019s patron Russia in advance of attacks on Syrian territory.</p>\n\n<p>The change, reported by people familiar with the situation, along with the stepped-up assaults, is worsening already troubled relations between Israel and Russia.</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s a danger, moreover, of Syria emerging as a new front in the Israel-Hamas war, a situation the US and regional allies are trying to avoid as they seek to contain the conflict. Tensions are already high on Israel\u2019s border with Lebanon, Hezbollah\u2019s base and from where it\u2019s exchanging fire with the Israeli military on a daily basis.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSpillover into Syria is not just a risk; it has already begun,\u201d Geir Pedersen, the United Nations special envoy for the country, said this week. \u201cFuel is being added to a tinderbox that was already beginning to ignite.\u201d&gt;</p>\n\n<p>Over the last decade, Syria became a global battleground. The US has almost 1,0&gt;00 troops there to counter Islamist extremists and Turkey is fighting Kurdish groups in the north. Iran and Russia, meanwhile, are helping President Bashar al-Assad stay in power. Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed, and millions forced to flee.</p>\n\n<p>Today, all-out war has been replaced by more sporadic fighting but the conflict in Israel-Gaza is exacerbating tensions.</p>\n\n<p>On Oct. 30, Israeli warplanes bombed a Syrian military base in the southern province of Daraa. That was after Israel had dropped leaflets warning Syrian forces against allowing Iran and its proxies to operate near the border with Israel, according to the people familiar with the situation.</p>\n\n<p>Five days earlier, Israel struck a weapons depot at a large Syrian base in the south, where Iranian officers and operatives from its proxy Hezbollah are embedded with Syrian forces. The attack killed more than a dozen Syrian soldiers and officers, according to the people. Israeli warplanes also hit air surveillance radars at a nearby facility, they added.</p>\n\n<p>Members of the Russian military police are occasionally present at a facility next to this base. It\u2019s unclear if they were there when Israel struck. The Syrian military acknowledged both attacks.</p>\n\n<p>Israel did not notify Russia in advance of the strikes, said the people who spoke about them.</p>\n\n<p>And in the past three weeks, Israel struck Syria\u2019s main two airports in Damascus and Aleppo several times, putting them out of service and forcing civilian aircraft to land in the Russian airbase in Hmeimim on Syria\u2019s Mediterranean coast instead, said the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.</p>\n\n<p>Israel has for years routinely struck targets in Syria, mainly to thwart Hezbollah militants there or secure its own north-eastern border. Since Russia intervened in the Syrian war in 2015, it\u2019s coordinated with Israel to ensure their forces don\u2019t clash or mistakenly fire on each other.</p>\n\n<p>Israel\u2019s Defense Ministry declined to comment on the recent lack of warnings or whether leaflets were dropped on Syrian forces ahead of Monday\u2019s strike.</p>\n\n<p>Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said his forces were determined to stop Iran ferrying weapons through Syria to neighboring Lebanon, where Hezbollah is based.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe will not allow a new Hezbollah front there or permit an Iranian military presence in Syria,\u201d he told reporters Tuesday.</p>\n\n<p>Hamas and Hezbollah receive extensive funding and training from Iran. They\u2019re both designated as terrorist groups by the US.</p>\n\n<p>The Israeli warnings to Russia served both countries. Five years ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin assured Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu he would do everything to prevent Iran and Hezbollah from gaining a foothold in southwest Syria, across from the Israeli occupied Golan Heights.</p>\n\n<p>But after Russia sent troops into Ukraine in 2022, Moscow tightened its alliance with Iran, straining relations with Israel. The war against Hamas, which rules Gaza and is also backed by Iran, and the deep cooperation between Israel and the US have driven the two even further apart.</p>\n\n<p>The US has moved two aircraft carriers to the region since Oct. 7, when Hamas militants swarmed southern Israeli communities and killed 1,400 people, many of them children. Washington stood by Israel as it launched a mass of airstrikes on Gaza and started a ground offensive. Russia has criticized Israel\u2019s actions, which Hamas-led authorities say have killed more than 9,000 people.</p>\n\n<p>Israel condemned Moscow for hosting a delegation from Hamas and Iran\u2019s deputy foreign minister last week. And on Oct. 29, a mob invaded an airport in Dagestan in southern Russia to seek out passengers on an incoming flight from Israel. Putin blamed Ukraine and Western intelligence services for the antisemitic incident.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cRussia is basically supporting our enemies,\u201d said Amos Yadlin, a former head of Israeli military intelligence, referring to Moscow\u2019s close military cooperation with Iran and its contacts with groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah.</p>\n\n<p>Since the Israel-Hamas war started, hundreds of Iran-backed militiamen have moved from the Iraq-Syria border to be nearer Israel.

[here's a second interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On2wbNLmeD0)\n\n> According to her account, the kidnappers treated her and other hostages \u201chumanely,\u201d believing they would be allowed to retreat safely to Gaza due to the protection of the Israeli captives. However, when the Israeli soldiers arrived, \u201cthey eliminated everyone, including the hostages. There was very, very heavy crossfire.\u201d\n\n\n\n\ni claimed IDF attacked residential areas - [idf sacrificed hostages for the greater good](https://new.thecradle.co/articles/what-really-happened-on-7th-october). that's pretty much their official policy. kill the terrorist don't bother trying to save the hostage. just know that it's very possible that hundreds of the civilians that died in Israel on Oct 7 was due to Israeli munitions. \n\n> In its report on the events at Be'eri Kibbutz, ABC News photographed artillery pieces resembling Israeli munitions outside a bombed-out home. The reporter, David Muir, mentioned that Hamas fighters, covered in plastic bags, were found in the aftermath. Additionally, videos of the scene show homes that appear to have been struck by munitions that Hamas fighters did not possess\n\n> \u201cHis voice trembles when his partner, who was besieged in her home shelter at the time, comes to mind. According to him, only on Monday night (9 October) and only after the commanders in the field made difficult decisions \u2014 including shelling houses with all their occupants inside in order to eliminate the terrorists along with the hostages \u2014 did the IDF complete the takeover of the kibbutz. The price was terrible: at least 112 Be\u2019eri people were killed. Others were kidnapped. Yesterday, 11 days after the massacre, the bodies of a mother and her son were discovered in one of the destroyed houses. It is believed that more bodies are still lying in the rubble.\u201d\n\n[interview with Brigadier General](https://newsrnd.com/news/2023-10-10-%22i-ask---what-is-the-phone-doing-here---he-replies---that-s-how-i-conduct-the-battle--%22---walla!-news.HkZnaE3MZT.html)\n\n> People made tough decisions, they prevented a much bigger catastrophe, if you can still imagine one ... You see the cell phone of someone who knows someone who calls him: 'My brothers are slaughtering me.' I see a phone on the table, ask what he's doing here, and he says, 'This is how I conduct the battle.' ... The operator in the car locates him in our systems, searches for the house next to him, makes sure signs with him on the phone and simply shoots at him, because that's where the terrorists besieging him.\n\n> \"There are other examples - an assault helicopter that comes to land Shaldag, they talk to the wounded CSC who is holding a wounded man, he reports on the terrorists approaching him, he wants to land this force in the community. We try to figure out where he is at the end of the landing, the helicopter flies low over the road. The Kingfisher commander tells the pilot that he recognizes two vans with terrorists, that he will land quickly because he wants to kill them. At this point, the CSC stops answering. In the end, they split forces, one force destroyed the vans and the other force reached the settlement. They went in to eliminate terrorists.\"\n\n> In the first hours alone, we dropped 350 munitions by the drones and hundreds more by combat helicopters.\n\n\n_____________\n\n> HAMAS spokesman define the entirety of Israel to be Palestine, therefore any Israeli is a settler in their view and regardless the towns around Gaza are older than Israel itself and are not settlements by any stretch of logic you're using.\n\nOne spokesman said that. The leader of Hamas and other spokesmen said they don't kill women and children. If they think all Israelis deserve to die and openly state it, why do they repeatedly say they don't kill civilians?

However, when the Israeli soldiers arrived, \u201cthey eliminated everyone, including the hostages. There was very, very heavy crossfire.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>i claimed IDF attacked residential areas - <a href=\"https://new.thecradle.co/articles/what-really-happened-on-7th-october\">idf sacrificed hostages for the greater good</a>. that&#39;s pretty much their official policy. kill the terrorist don&#39;t bother trying to save the hostage. just know that it&#39;s very possible that hundreds of the civilians that died in Israel on Oct 7 was due to Israeli munitions. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In its report on the events at Be&#39;eri Kibbutz, ABC News photographed artillery pieces resembling Israeli munitions outside a bombed-out home. The reporter, David Muir, mentioned that Hamas fighters, covered in plastic bags, were found in the aftermath. Additionally, videos of the scene show homes that appear to have been struck by munitions that Hamas fighters did not possess</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHis voice trembles when his partner, who was besieged in her home shelter at the time, comes to mind. According to him, only on Monday night (9 October) and only after the commanders in the field made difficult decisions \u2014 including shelling houses with all their occupants inside in order to eliminate the terrorists along with the hostages \u2014 did the IDF complete the takeover of the kibbutz. The price was terrible: at least 112 Be\u2019eri people were killed. Others were kidnapped. Yesterday, 11 days after the massacre, the bodies of a mother and her son were discovered in one of the destroyed houses. It is believed that more bodies are still lying in the rubble.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://newsrnd.com/news/2023-10-10-%22i-ask---what-is-the-phone-doing-here---he-replies---that-s-how-i-conduct-the-battle--%22---walla!-news.HkZnaE3MZT.html\">interview with Brigadier General</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>People made tough decisions, they prevented a much bigger catastrophe, if you can still imagine one ... You see the cell phone of someone who knows someone who calls him: &#39;My brothers are slaughtering me.&#39; I see a phone on the table, ask what he&#39;s doing here, and he says, &#39;This is how I conduct the battle.&#39; ... The operator in the car locates him in our systems, searches for the house next to him, makes sure signs with him on the phone and simply shoots at him, because that&#39;s where the terrorists besieging him.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;There are other examples - an assault helicopter that comes to land Shaldag, they talk to the wounded CSC who is holding a wounded man, he reports on the terrorists approaching him, he wants to land this force in the community. We try to figure out where he is at the end of the landing, the helicopter flies low over the road. The Kingfisher commander tells the pilot that he recognizes two vans with terrorists, that he will land quickly because he wants to kill them. At this point, the CSC stops answering. In the end, they split forces, one force destroyed the vans and the other force reached the settlement. They went in to eliminate terrorists.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>In the first hours alone, we dropped 350 munitions by the drones and hundreds more by combat helicopters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>HAMAS spokesman define the entirety of Israel to be Palestine, therefore any Israeli is a settler in their view and regardless the towns around Gaza are older than Israel itself and are not settlements by any stretch of logic you&#39;re using.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One spokesman said that. The leader of Hamas and other spokesmen said they don&#39;t kill women and children. If they think all Israelis deserve to die and openly state it, why do they repeatedly say they don&#39;t kill civilians? They at least pretend to care. That much is objectively true.</p>\n\n<p>Why are there reports of them going up to people, taking hostage, and saying things like &quot;we are muslim, we dont hurt innocent people&quot;? </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Whataboutism,</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>no it&#39;s not whataboutism. you deliberately ignore the point. the point is that rhetoric from one or two members of a group does not necessarily equate the official policy of the group. you need the whole picture. i&#39;m not going to assume one far-right israeli politician speaks for the whole country</p>\n\n<p>you can go ahead and keep accusing me of lying, being biased, whatever. it doesn&#39;t matter. the truth is the truth.</p>\n\n<p>i&#39;m not &quot;covering&quot; for hamas because i could care less for hamas. i could also care less for israel (well, at least the IDF &amp; the current administration). both of these groups have proven to be horrifically brutal not only to each other but their own civilians. the civilians in both cases are the innocent bystanders who did not deserve to die.</p>\n</div>",
