While Russia continues to make gains in the east, Ukraine tries to take back lost territory in the south.*\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/07/02/world/russia-ukraine-war-news?smid=tw-nytimesworld&smtyp=cur#russian-strikes-on-civilians-sharply-increase-in-the-second-half-of-june-ukraine-says\n\nJuly 2, 2022\n\nKYIV, Ukraine \u2014 Russian attacks on civilian sites sharply increased in the second half of June, Ukrainian officials say, with the strikes involving older and more imprecise weapons from Moscow\u2019s Soviet arsenal that result in greater casualties.\n\nOver 200 missiles were fired on Ukraine in that period \u2014 more than double the amount in the first half of the month \u2014 Brig. Gen. Oleksii Hromov said at a news conference on Thursday.\n\n\u201cTo carry out rocket strikes, the enemy in more than 50 percent of cases is using missiles from the Soviet reserve, which are not sufficiently precise,\u201d General Hromov said. \u201cAs a result, civilian buildings are being hit.\u201d\n\nSome of the deadliest strikes occurred in the past week. On Monday, two old Kh-22 missiles hit a mall in the industrial city of Kremenchuk, killing at least 20 people, and an attack in the northeastern city of Kharkiv killed five people and wounded 22. And on Friday morning, missiles ripped into an apartment building in a town near Odesa, killing 21 people and injuring dozens.\n\nRussia has claimed that it aims only at targets of military value \u2014 even though some were hundreds of miles from the front lines in eastern Ukraine \u2014 and that whenever a civilian facility was hit, it was one that the Ukrainian military had co-opted for use as a command post, a shelter for foreign fighters or storage for weapons.\n\nThe Kremlin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, told reporters on his daily conference call on Friday that Russia targeted ammunition and arms depots, plants that manufacture and repair military equipment, and places where \u201cforeign mercenaries\u201d and \u201cnationalist elements\u201d are based and trained.\n\nRussia also often accuses the Ukrainians of staging the attack and using paid crisis actors.\n\n\u201cIn Odesa, the Kyiv regime is preparing another sophisticated provocation to accuse the Russian Armed Forces of killing civilians (including minors) and purposefully destroying civilian infrastructure using cluster munitions prohibited by international agreements,\u201d the head of the National Defense Control Center of the Russian Federation, Col.-Gen. Mikhail Mizintsev, said in a news release on Saturday in an apparent reference to Friday\u2019s attack.\n\n\u201cAll participants in the staged scenes after the video filming are provided with a cash reward in the amount of $500, while $100 have already been paid to each in advance,\u201d the news release claimed.\n\nBut from the start of the war, Russia\u2019s forces have shelled civilian areas and rendered some towns and cities uninhabitable. Attacks have struck people in bread lines and on playgrounds, as well as apartment blocks, theaters and hospitals. After each one, Russia has denied or deflected responsibility.\n\nThe Kremlin mantras have found resonance among the Russian people, many of whom are influenced by state-controlled television networks and conservative pro-war online commentators who bolster the party lines, refusing to believe even their own relatives in Ukraine who tell them about what is really happening on the ground.\n\nYet journalists, independent organizations and Ukrainian officials have documented Russian attacks on thousands of civilian buildings, structures and vehicles.\n\nIn some cases, Russia used older weapons that might have been aimed at an industrial facility but missed, putting civilians at risk. But in many other cases, the Russians\u2019 explanations have not held up under scrutiny.\n\n\u2014 Valerie Hopkins, Daniel Victor and Ivan Nechepurenko",

After each one, Russia has denied or deflected responsibility.</p>\n\n<p>The Kremlin mantras have found resonance among the Russian people, many of whom are influenced by state-controlled television networks and conservative pro-war online commentators who bolster the party lines, refusing to believe even their own relatives in Ukraine who tell them about what is really happening on the ground.</p>\n\n<p>Yet journalists, independent organizations and Ukrainian officials have documented Russian attacks on thousands of civilian buildings, structures and vehicles.</p>\n\n<p>In some cases, Russia used older weapons that might have been aimed at an industrial facility but missed, putting civilians at risk. But in many other cases, the Russians\u2019 explanations have not held up under scrutiny.</p>\n\n<p>\u2014 Valerie Hopkins, Daniel Victor and Ivan Nechepurenko</p>\n</div>",

I wonder though is this really true however. You do have multiple areas where you could argue that time is on Russia's side to Ukraine's detriment, most of them are not strictly military ones however.\n\n - The global food situation, at this point it is disingenuous to say that Russia is solely responsible for the current situation with predictions about coming food shortages, famine, and the instability that will accompany that, given how 2 years of Covid, climate change, poor harvests, droughts, conflict, and lack of short term agricultural flexibility have also impacted food supplies. Of course Russian actions in regards invading Ukraine a substantial food exporter, and disrupting supplies of fuel and fertilisers needed for modern agriculture, they have a large part in causing the issue. Nonetheless in the long term the bargaining chip of Russia holding some food reserves they can export, while not enough to negate the food crisis, it still would be something to use especially if new or renewed conflicts create refugee streams which divide Europe. While this may not be an ace card to suddenly end the war decisively for Russia, but enough to sow discord and partially break up the united front against Russia.\n\n - Media attention, while the war has captured the globes attention much more than any contemporary conflict like Syria, Armenia, or Afghanistan to an extent that 5 months in there is still strong media attention, if the media attention and public engagement with the details of the war decline as a result of multiple causes the amount of support and pressure to support Ukraine could decline. If this conflict spans a long length of time this is something that could benefit Russia to Ukraine's detriment.\n\n - Economic, the economic effect on Ukraine as a result of this war is devastating with significant declines in GDP projected over this year and the next, and while Russia is impacted by sanctions, the decline in GDP is nowhere near as severe and will have the money/resources in some way to pay for this war for some time. The big question in regards to economics is can Ukraine afford in the long term to fight a war, or to put it more accurately, will their own economic issues severely impact their abilities to fight. While at the moment donations of money and war material are coming in from NATO countries, any possible interruptions or reduction in support would be detrimental to the Ukraine, and while a complete divestment from supporting Ukraine is very unlikely, a reduction in support due to changing priorities, new policies, or domestic issues etc, is a possibility.\n\nI do not believe that the long war benefits Russia or Ukraine decisively, but more benefits each side in some ways and damage them in others.",

It accomplished those missions by 2008, violence plummeted until Iraq was safer than most US cities by 2009, with transition of power with the SOFA kicking in during that timeframe, most troops removed by 2010 and all troops removed by 2011. The US didn't get involved in Iraq again until 2014 at the height of the DAESH War, first to assist the Yazidis and Kurds, then assisting the Iraqi govt retake its lost territory with a ground advisory mission and air strikes.\n\nIn Afghanistan, the US led the NATO ISAF coalition from 2001-2014, when OEF ended and responsibility was fully given to the Afghans. The enemy also wasn't a conventional foreign invasion by one of the strongest militaries in the world, it was an insurgency mostly by the Taliban trying to retake control of Afghanistan from the Kabul govt we stood up. That conflict lasted from 2001-2021 and the end is characterized by the US abandoning our allies and washing our hands.\n\nWe didn't give them 2 trillion, that was the total cost including the cost of US combat deployments, which aren't cheap.

If Europe doesn't fold this winter (when gas shortages will be at their worst), then the energy prices will start coming back down as all the new infrastructure comes online. About a year from now the decision will be \"would we potentially improve our currently high but bearable energy prices at the cost of abandoning Ukraine\".

After finding the target, a 4.5kg shaped charge is triggered on it, burning through a conditional tank or infantry fighting vehicle.</p>\n\n<p>They can be used both by aircraft, using them as part of the RBC-250/500 cluster bomb, and by the Smerch MLRS.  In the latest photographs, the remnants of these munitions found in Syria show both the characteristic parachute and the same characteristic &quot;cylinder&quot; that contains the computing equipment and the warhead.</p>\n</div>",

I&#39;ve seen evidence (and have said it multiple times) that Biden didn&#39;t give 2 shits about Ukraine and was dragged kicking and screaming by SecDef and SecState to support it. He only changed his mind after his refugee camp visit (in Poland mind you, he&#39;s still never been in ukraine) and his own wife&#39;s visit.</p>\n\n<p>If NATO wanted to escalate, they would&#39;ve done so during the opening days when everyone was talking about a no fly zone.
