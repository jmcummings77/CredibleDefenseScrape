The Pentagon\u2019s inspector general released a redacted version of it on Thursday.\n\nThe high rate of weapons that were missing or otherwise immediately unaccounted for in government databases \u201cmay increase the risk of theft or diversion,\u201d the report found.\n\nEven with better methods in place, it concluded, tracking additional materiel sent to Ukraine will \u201cbe difficult as the inventory continues to change, and accuracy and completeness will likely only become more difficult over time.\u201d\n\nThe number of the weapons reviewed in the report represents only a small fraction of about $50 billion in military equipment that the United States has sent Ukraine since 2014, when Russia seized Crimea and parts of the eastern Donbas region. Most of the weapons that have been delivered so far \u2014 including tanks, air-defense systems, artillery launchers and ammunition \u2014 were pledged after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in February 2022.\n\nStill, the Pentagon investigation offers a first glimpse of efforts to account for the most high-risk tools of American military might that have been rushed to Ukraine in the last two years. An increasing number of lawmakers, skeptical of the costs of being Ukraine\u2019s single largest military benefactor, are resisting sending more aid to Kyiv and have demanded the oversight.\n\nThe report did not detail exactly how many of the 39,139 high-risk pieces of materiel that were given to Ukraine in the years before and after the invasion were considered \u201cdelinquent\u201d but it put the potential loss at about $1 billion of the total $1.69 billion worth of the weapons that had been sent.\n\nAs of last June, the latest data available, the United States had given Ukraine more than 10,000 Javelin anti-tank missiles, 2,500 Stinger surface-to-air missiles and about 750 Kamikaze Switchblade drones, 430 medium-range air-to-air missiles and 23,000 night vision devices.\n\nDangerous combat conditions made it largely impossible for Defense Department officials to travel to the front lines to ensure the weapons were being used as intended, according to Pentagon and State Department officials responsible for tracking them.\n\nThe required accounting procedures \u201care not practical in a dynamic and hostile wartime environment,\u201d Alexandra N. Baker, the acting undersecretary of defense for policy, wrote in a Nov. 15 response to an earlier draft of the report.\n\nShe also said there were not enough to Defense Department employees at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv to easily track all of the most sensitive weapons and equipment, which she said currently total more than 50,000 items in Ukraine \u201cand growing.\u201d\n\nIt \u201cis beyond the capacity of the limited D.O.D. personnel in country to physically inventory, even if access were unrestricted,\u201d Ms. Baker wrote in her response, a copy of which was included in the report.",

There's a reason scrutiny and accounting procedures exist, because in the past it's been proven that without these measures mistakes and theft/fraud happen.   \n\n\nJust because we don't see evidence of these trades or transfers now doesn't mean we won't in the future, drawing any conclusions from this other than that the risk profile has potentially increased (and the degree to which can be debated) wouldn't really be appropriate given these weapons are likely to be hanging around for the next several decades, not just a couple of years.   \n\n\nSay the Ukrainian conflict goes cold, or heavily stalemated with small skirmishes, what's to stop the weaponry being sold piecemeal as Ukraine's military starts demobilizing and the conscripts and local commanders manning a line for 8 months of the year see financial opportunities that now outweigh the likelihood of them *\\*currently needing the weaponry for their personal use/protection\\*?* Right now, with constant Russian assaults on their positions it's in their direct interest not to sell any weaponry they have access to, that may not be the same once or if this conflict starts to die down.  \n\n\nThe Ex-USSR stockpiles weren't pilfered until after the fall of the Soviet Union, years after the potential conflict they were stockpiled for was forgotten about, it works this way in nearly all modern conflicts, the Mujahideen, Iraq, Vietnam, Afghanistan, the arms start reappearing in larger numbers after the scrutiny and upheaval dies down, once people stop thinking about the fight and start thinking about their wallets.   \n\n\nFor what it's worth I do think you're right with how things currently stand, there isn't much if any evidence that I've seen that definitively proves that any arms given to Ukraine have ended up on the black market and Ukraine's internal tracking measures are likely far more robust than they are given credit for.

Carrying lists on me 24/7 of my squad's sensitive items. \n\nDuncan, maybe it's just me....but I don't find this particularly impressive? I have 50 people in my phone with the same or more experience that can offer the same answers you do, but without the sanctimonious tone. \n\nBut sure sergeant major, I'll play your silly game; currently sitting at 21 years and am currently still serving the Army Reserve.
