We don\u2019t dare leave the house. Our household has a child, three older people, and five others. At night, we can hear sounds of weapons firing.

        "body": "I've been thinking about the strategy followed by Hamas in this war and how it differed from previous wars with Israel which involved a ground operation (2009,2014).\n\nI think Hamas's general strategy is greatly influenced by Hezbollah's 2006 war with Israel. Then, Hezbollah acted far from its guerrilla tactics and appeared to operate similar to a state army (distinct uniform, defending positions rather than classic hit-and-run attacks) [1]. It was argued that Hezbollah had the goal of defending its ability to fire rockets at Israel until the end and organised its fighting and attrition around this goal.\n\nWhile Hamas is much weaker and less resourced, its strategy always seemed to centre on its ability to fire rockets on Israel. In 2009, Operation Cast Lead, Hamas leaders declared victory by firing one rocket at Israel after the ceasefire. In 2014, the waited for IDF troops in Shajaia (east of Gaza city, close to border with Israeli) and ambushed or lured Israeli soldiers into traps. By Israeli standards, IDF incurred huge losses. \n\nThe other part of the strategy is that at some point the human death toll in Gaza will force the powers that be to intervene and mediate a ceasefire. It keeps Hamas at a military loss, but it is still in charge, and manages to give them something to celebrate with.\n\nHowever, this time it seems that they are slightly confused most likely by underestimating the international reaction to their massacre of Israelis on 7 October. \n\nOn the one hand, it seems that they are still trying to establish their capability to fire rockets, and they are still doing but on a much lower scale.  \n\nThe Israeli restraint when it comes to rushing to invade Hamas's favourite home turf (Beit Hanoun, Sahajaia; generally the north-eastern parts of the Gaza Strip) and a decision to encircle Gaza city from the Mediterranean sent Hamas into a confused state.\n\nMost of their claims about destroying Israeli tanks and APCs are unverified. Even their  short clips, fail to show the aftermath of any attack (understandably). I haven't seen any IED attack yet. Not even one. \n\nHamas media output now contains (in Arabic) more phrases like \"we targeted\" and \"we fired\" rather than \"we destroyed\". Look at this clip [2] for example. They are simply saying they are firing mortars, but at whom or where they landed is anyone's guess. \n\nThey are trying to do what Hezbollah did in 2006 by counter-attacking and harassing the Israeli forces. But it seems to be happening at a much smaller scale and is only used for propaganda purposes. Clearly they have so far been unable to stop the Israeli advance on the ground at all.\n\nAdd to that that the world, the superpowers, seem to have been unfazed by the death toll in Gaza, which is unprecedented. This certainly is coming at a cost  and a surprise to Hamas as it is often the factor that leads to shortening Israel's offensive, through some ceasefire agreement to end what always used to be a relatively short war.\n\n[1] [The 2006 Lebanon Campaign and the Future of Warfare:\nImplications for Army and Defense Policy,\nStephen D.

It keeps Hamas at a military loss, but it is still in charge, and manages to give them something to celebrate with.</p>\n\n<p>However, this time it seems that they are slightly confused most likely by underestimating the international reaction to their massacre of Israelis on 7 October. </p>\n\n<p>On the one hand, it seems that they are still trying to establish their capability to fire rockets, and they are still doing but on a much lower scale.  </p>\n\n<p>The Israeli restraint when it comes to rushing to invade Hamas&#39;s favourite home turf (Beit Hanoun, Sahajaia; generally the north-eastern parts of the Gaza Strip) and a decision to encircle Gaza city from the Mediterranean sent Hamas into a confused state.</p>\n\n<p>Most of their claims about destroying Israeli tanks and APCs are unverified. Even their  short clips, fail to show the aftermath of any attack (understandably). I haven&#39;t seen any IED attack yet. Not even one. </p>\n\n<p>Hamas media output now contains (in Arabic) more phrases like &quot;we targeted&quot; and &quot;we fired&quot; rather than &quot;we destroyed&quot;. Look at this clip [2] for example. They are simply saying they are firing mortars, but at whom or where they landed is anyone&#39;s guess. </p>\n\n<p>They are trying to do what Hezbollah did in 2006 by counter-attacking and harassing the Israeli forces. But it seems to be happening at a much smaller scale and is only used for propaganda purposes. Clearly they have so far been unable to stop the Israeli advance on the ground at all.</p>\n\n<p>Add to that that the world, the superpowers, seem to have been unfazed by the death toll in Gaza, which is unprecedented. This certainly is coming at a cost  and a surprise to Hamas as it is often the factor that leads to shortening Israel&#39;s offensive, through some ceasefire agreement to end what always used to be a relatively short war.</p>\n\n<p>[1] <a href=\"https://press.armywarcollege.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1640&amp;context=monographs\">The 2006 Lebanon Campaign and the Future of Warfare:\nImplications for Army and Defense Policy,\nStephen D.

At best, they provide excessive administrative overhead and operative friction causing worse performance, at worst they invite undermining of the central state. \n\n* It would be an international escalation of this conflict.\n\n* From a domestic standpoint, a lot of the longevity of support is based on \"no boots on the ground\" in Ukraine. \n\n* The act of buying foreign manpower to die in your war means that those fighting for monetary benefit are disproportionately coming from the global south, which goes against the optics the west is trying to establish.\n\nI would argue Russia has most if not all of these drawbacks as well. The reason Russia does it is that PMC's allow Putin more room for maneuvre within the Russian political sphere. It's a pool of manpower which lets him not send conscripts to Ukraine, and he can personally play the leaders off each other to maintain his power.

At best, they provide excessive administrative overhead and operative friction causing worse performance, at worst they invite undermining of the central state. </p></li>\n<li><p>It would be an international escalation of this conflict.</p></li>\n<li><p>From a domestic standpoint, a lot of the longevity of support is based on &quot;no boots on the ground&quot; in Ukraine. </p></li>\n<li><p>The act of buying foreign manpower to die in your war means that those fighting for monetary benefit are disproportionately coming from the global south, which goes against the optics the west is trying to establish.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I would argue Russia has most if not all of these drawbacks as well. The reason Russia does it is that PMC&#39;s allow Putin more room for maneuvre within the Russian political sphere. It&#39;s a pool of manpower which lets him not send conscripts to Ukraine, and he can personally play the leaders off each other to maintain his power.

The point of this invasion would be either the genocide or ethnic cleansing if the state of Israel. \n\nHamas did not succeed in this objective, but it did succeed in causing large amounts of both military and civilian casualties. The proportional response to an Enemy who has that threat profile and now a *verified ability* to carry that out is an invasion to remove that ability.\n\n\nHowever, I do agree that Israel has not been willing to accept casualties to it's soldiers in order to reduce casualties to the civilian population of Gaza. Israel has sustained <100 KIA in Gaza City proper, and has already taken over ~35% of the urban areas in the north of Gaza. This is an astoundingly lower amount, and one of the tactics they have implemented to do this is lobbying absurd amounts of firepower at both immediate threats and throughout the strip in areas they designate as strong points or storage facilities used by Hamas. Israel could reduce it's amount of deep strikes to reduce civilian casualties, but they likely also take significantly more casualties to it's armed forces. \n\nAt the beginning of the 10/7, I thought the IDF would take a minimum of 1k KIA in its assault on Gaza City proper, and likely over 2k KIA if it wanted to take over the entire strip. If present casualties trends hold true, I don't think the IDF will even take 200 KIA in taking Gaza City and the urban areas in the north.  \n\nOn the other hand, I don't have access to all the information. But the numbers we do have \n\n~12k Palestinians KIA \n ~35% (~4500) of the above under the age of 18 (~47% of the pre-war population)\n~22.5 (~2600), women over the age of 18 (~28% of the pre-war population).\n\nPoint to a willingness to accept collateral damage. I don't think the children stat is as useful as the women stat to be honest, because I cannot find a breakdown by age and gender. Hamas has been known to use teenagers within it's ranks, and typically the casualties ratio skews far more to the 14-18 bracket than the 0-14. \n\n\nBut women are almost never fighters, and cannot join the Al-Qassam brigade. \n\n\n\nOn the other hand this data doesn't really say why someone died beyond \"victim of Occupier aggression\" which is also inflating the total. The GHM still counts the 471 revised estimate from the \"hospital strike\" under this category, despite overwhelming evidence it wasn't the IDF. It's likely a non-insignificant numbers of these deaths may be collateral damage from Hamas and PIJ rocket failures landing within the strip itself. We also have some evidence of Hamas massacring fleeing civilians (coastal road sniper attack) and of supposed airstrikes on fleeing civilians (of the two, one was a propane/hydrocarbon tank explosion and the other also appeared to be that, but no footage was released of the even itself, but there was no crater present and the damage profile did not match a bomb, although it could have been a smaller munition).",

Siege lasting months with limited flow of goods into the city, and smaller scale fights during that time would likely generate significant amount of casualties anyway.\n\nBasically, Gaza Arabs shouldn't have let terrorists turn their city into a jihadist pseudostate in the first place. Now there's only one way to get rid of the terrorists, and it won't be pretty.\n\n> I'm of the opinion peace can only be achieved with Hamas no longer in power.\n\nIt's unclear what would peace look like with Hamas removed from power. There are no plans to resettle Gaza Arab population anywhere else. PA never condemned Hamas's terrorist attacks, and has zero credibility to run Gaza, so it would be foolish to hand it over to them.

As a sweetener, Israel could demand of Hamas to prosecute Gazan civilians who actively participated in massacres (if any even survive); that could be tied to the prisoner release that all Palestinian factions demand.\n\nIsrael's problem is all the obvious reasons Palestinians embrace militancy in the first place, and the suppression of any political alternative. Hamas' record in government is widely unpopular, its militancy has been the only way it upheld any legitimacy. Changing Hamas leadership's incentives and letting it be an opposition party within a functioning state would work.

Anyone paying very close attention already has their opinion made up, and people paying loose attention won&#39;t really notice the exact cadence of the release of these videos and pictures.</p>\n\n<p>To me, the goal seems to be updates on the progress made through the hospital complex to people who are already generally supportive or at least understanding of the IDF going into Al-Shifa (I&#39;d argue most world leaders fall into this category).</p>\n\n<p>Not everything needs to be milked for maximum public opinion impact, mostly because thats not worthwhile. Israel&#39;s release of these videos should mostly focus on avoiding own-goals like getting caught in lies or fabricating evidence.</p>\n</div>",
