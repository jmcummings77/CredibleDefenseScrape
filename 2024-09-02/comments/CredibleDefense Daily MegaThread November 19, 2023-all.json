        "body": "Konrad Muzyka thoughts after visiting southern Ukraine with Kofman, Lee, and Gady\n\nhttps://postimg.cc/crqYVFky\n\nExecutive summary\n\nAs you may know, I spent the past week in Ukraine with Michael Kofman, Rob Lee and Franz Stefan Gady. We spent a couple of days in Kyiv, but most of the time, we devoted to meeting troops in the south and east. We conducted many interviews, and undoubtedly, it was the most productive trip since the first one we took a year ago. We have a lot of food for thought, and I think we have a good idea of where the war currently stands.\n\nBelow, you will see my impressions from this latest study visit. I am stressing that these are my views. Undoubtedly, Mike's, Rob's and Stefan's will be somehow different. Given that this post is behind the paywall, I will also allow myself to be more honest. Please ping me beforehand if you are a journalist who wishes to use excerpts from the points I make below.\n\n\u2022The Ukrainian counteroffensive ended without achieving its primary or secondary objectives; It is good that General Zaluzhny made it clear in the Economist article that there will be no breakthrough; Ukrainian operational potential in Zaporizhihia is exhausted;\n\n\u2022From my point of view, the discrepancy between tactics and strategy was too big and consequently, Ukraine's approach during the counteroffensive (small unit) tactics could not deliver the expected objectives;\n\n\u2022But the downside to Zaluzhny's article was one of the words he used: stalemate. I think (and this is purely my own interpretation) that Zelensky's approach centres around exerting continuous pressure on Western partners to provide Ukraine with equipment. In this context, a stalemate, a cessation of activities, or the freezing of the frontline has strong 2015 vibes and could result in the freezing of the war in general. Ukrainian political leadership wants to avoid such an outcome as it may encourage some Western partners to seek to go \"back to business as usual\" with Russia.\n\n\u2022 That's why Zelensky quickly hit back to Zaluzhny's words, saying there was no stalemate. But Zelensky nevertheless dismissed the commander of Ukrainian SOF behind Zaluzhny's back;\n\n\u2022 It is, therefore, clear that the relationship between both men is strained;\n\n\u2022 Personally, I heard nothing about the issue of \"negotiations with Russia\";\n\n\u2022 I expect Ukrainian attacks in the south (Kherson and Zaporizhiia) to continue over the coming weeks and months, even though they can only deliver tactical gains.\n\n\u2022 For weeks, we warned (Rochan) that the Ukrainian intensity of operations would need to decrease due to shortages of artillery munitions (we predicted late September-early October). Ultimately, we were slightly off. Ukrainian access to artillery munitions is limited, resulting in significantly decreased intensity of artillery strikes. With Ukraine's land forces being very artillery-centric, it is hard to imagine any major(ish) offensive actions over the next six months. A lot will depend on the Western supply of artillery munitions. Still, with the US and Europe not fulfilling their production objectives, Ukraine may limit their offensive operations throughout the entire 2024.\n\n\u2022 Western supplies of artillery ammunition are not only limited but also occur irregularly, which makes it very difficult to plan fire missions; Likewise, Ukrainians would like to understand the logistics of any system in the long term perspective so that they could plan operations accordingly over a longer period;\n\n\u2022 With small exceptions (Kherson and Orikhiv), Ukrainians are now on the defensive along the entire front, which will likely necessitate the creation of fortified lines on the Ukrainian side; This, combined with mobilisation (see below), would significantly decrease pressure on Ukrainian forces needed (also its quality) to defend the frontline;\n\n\u2022 The aftermath of the counteroffensive will likely force Kyiv to rework its theory of victory. I think that pushing Russia out of Ukraine (even to pre-FEB22) border will be an incredibly difficult task. As stated, the initiative has shifted. Russia is now on the offensive, and with its economy or war footing, it can produce more of everything compared to Ukraine. Its economic potential can sustain the war, and I expect Russians to conduct several attempts to break the frontline deadlock from now until the end of 2024;\n\n\u2022 Ukraine suffers from shortages of almost everything, although its industry is working hard to plug some gaps. For instance, Ukraine plans to produce hundreds of thousands of drones next year, which can not only improve its ISR but fill some gaps caused by an insufficient number of artillery shells;\n\n\u2022 The deficit of 152 mm shells is huge, but ideally, over the next few years, Ukrainians would like to make the full switch to NATO's 155 mm standard;\n\n\u2022 Ukrainians cannot scale production as fast as the Russians, leaving them vulnerable in many areas (artillery production, armour, drones, missiles); Another interesting, although not necessarily surprising, idea is to push a lot of funding from the government to the private/NGO sector; Ukrainian companies made great quality products and are more cost-effective and flexible in fulfiling military needs; They also respond to changes in requirements quicker;\n\n\u2022 Some gaps will be more difficult to address. For instance, many Ukrainian soldiers we spoke to spoke highly of M113s APCs and asked for more; No one asked for ATACMS, but almost everyone asked for M113s; Request for ATACMS was political rather than military driven, although again, everything depends on the numbers; My view is that if Ukrainian soldiers were to choose between hundreds of M113s and 20 ATACMS, they'd choose the former;\n\n\u2022 Tanks are neither obsolete nor heading for obsolescence; They are used regularly, and Ukrainians asked for more; They continue to offer a high degree of manoeuvrability, firepower and protection;\n\n\u2022 The war is also very drone-centric. There could be 20 drones flying near the frontline along the 10 km wide front. Neither side has the ability to achieve a tactical surprise unless an attack is launched in drone adverse weather (rain with very heavy winds); Readiness to respond to ground attacks is very high. We saw Russian troops (a platoon) walking towards the frontline. Once they were detected, they were engaged by mortars within 30 seconds and by artillery cluster munitions after an additional four minutes. Both sides have capabilities to ISR opposing forces' tactical depths;\n\n\u2022 As you are hopefully accustomed to how we report frontline changes (The situation at selected axes and directions), we want to make it clear that probably 90% (if not more) of attacks conducted by both sides involve squad/platoon formations. Company-level attacks are a rarity; That's why initial Russian attacks near Avdiivka were so unusual, as they involved the concurrent deployment of battalions/regiments, something we have not seen since MAR2022;\n\n\u2022 Ukrainians suffer from the lack of battalion commanders. That's many in some brigades, battalions were expanded to include new companies;\n\n\u2022 Morale is high, but troops are also exhausted; Many have been in the fight for months or, in some cases, more than a year. Legislation has been introduced now to allow 40-day of vacations a year, something which was welcomed by soldiers on the ground;\n\n\u2022 The bulk of Ukrainian forces are deployed in or near the front, which makes it very difficult to train and regenerate formations. In this context, I believe that Kyiv's current approach to mobilisation (ongoing but hidden) is insufficient to build up forces necessary for force regeneration, let alone future large-scale counteroffensives;\n\n\u2022 Although the initial training has been extended from 30 to 60 days, it still fails to address manpower gaps. Even partial mobilisation would allow currently deployed troops to be rotated, retrained and regenerated, which should improve their survivability (decrease losses) and increase combat effectiveness;\n\n\u2022 Although it has already been reported in the Polish press, we confirmed that Polish 155mm Krab SPHS are very versatile. The manufacturer recommends changing the barrel every 1,500 fires. Some Ukrainian guns fired more than 6,000 rounds. As a result, some barrels can now fire 157 mm rounds;\n\n\u2022 Russians don't conserve glide bombs;\n\n\u2022 Russians continue to operate Ka-52s with three usually on standby; if a target pops up, one helo lights it with a laser and two engage with missiles; They have a new missile with 11-12 km range.\n\n\u2022 Ukrainians cannot effectively counter this threat;\n\n\u2022 There are concerns that Russians may finally push to reach the Osikl River in the Kharkiv Oblast (they have the capacity); However, at the same time, troops told us that some Russian actions appeared to have a fixing character; We cannot presently assess the likelihood of a Russian large-scale attack in this area;\n\n\u2022 The situation in Kupyansk is interesting in that Russians have the capacity to reach the Osikl River; If attacks are successful, Russians may again begin to hit Kharkiv with artillery;\n\nThis is it. As you can see, the overall situation does not look great, both on the frontlines and internally in Ukraine. Russia will likely maintain the initiative, while Ukrainians may focus on defensive operations, some limited ground attacks, and drone attacks on targets across Russia, especially if Moscow starts attacking Ukraine's energy infrastructure. A reported redeployment of S-400s (pending IMINT confirmation) from the Kaliningrad Oblast to southern Russia indicates that Moscow could be preparing for such a scenario.",

However, neither they nor the Russians had the technology (accurate fires especially PGMs, secure comms, all weather secure drones, artillery fires software, potentially using AI) to pull it off until the mid 2010s. That was one reason the US military in particular were very worried about fighting the Russians tactically, because they had 3x the maneuver unit level artillery fire support and a system where they had maximized its lethality and responsiveness to find and kill NATO targets.\n\nWhile the US and other top end NATO militaries have been able to do this for decades too, the Russians wanted to adopt across the board as part of doctrine. Like BTGs, the West has been making those since WW2, but it was always up to the tactical commanders how and when they wanted to do it, whereas in the Russian army, it was mandatory  for a decade: all brigades and regiments WILL form into battalion tactical groups to conduct their operations (Its not mandatory anymore though).\n\nThe Ukrainians copied Recon Fire Complex, working on it to some degree with the advent of their \"arty uber app\" before the war, but have since streamlined it since the war started.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>we want to make it clear that probably 90% (if not more) of attacks conducted by both sides involve squad/platoon formations. Company-level attacks are a rarity\n\nWhat that translates to is that the UAF and RuAF have both recognized that they can no longer plan attacks that include goals that require massed company, battalion or higher  involvement. Either its because they can't do them, or because its too risky (more likely reason), they've accepted the downgrading of tactical gains to be only what infantry squads and platoons can achieve, which are very limited in size and scope.\n\nThe plus for that is they can likely support those squad and platoon sized attacks with the same amount of fires and enablers that would typically go to a company sized attack, or higher, which increases the odds of succeeding (never possible for an assault element to have too much support). \n\nPart of the issues as to why massed attacks are very risky is the tactical situation, the attackers (both sides) having no solid answers to defensive tactical systems and TTPs, such as drone ISTAR and FPV, ground launched ATGMs, helicopter launched ATGMs, artillery fires including PGM, and deep, dense minefields (mixed AT and AP).\n\nThe other part is related to competence. Planning those operations involves competence at every level of planning. It's not a secret that neither Russian or Ukrainian Armed Forces were especially high quality beforehand, but they've since suffered heavy casualties to their company and field grade officer corps, while needing to massively expand their military size, while not having any real systems in place to ensure quality matches quantity.

So the same tactical units the Ukrainians already had issues commanding and controlling are now bigger.\n\nWhich brings us back to why company-battalion-brigade sized attacks likely wont succeed. Even if they had answers to the defensive tactical problems, they'd still likely screw up the planning and execution phases. \n\nNot only does Ukraine suffer from a lack of good battalion commanders (likely the Russians too), but both will have battalion and under tactical performance suffer more so from a lack of battalion staff, which was a deliberate decision both militaries made decades ago, a carry over from doctrine and thinking from the Soviet era:\n\nBattalions don't need larger staffs (like in Western militaries), all that work will be done at higher headquarters, with well planned operations pushed down on the battalion with simplistic instructions (often written in the margins of a map by the Bde/Regt commander to the battalion commander), requiring only the rigid adherence to battle drills (which it turns out were largely not effective).\n\nSo battalion level leaders are out of their element in terms of competence, they can't even get sufficient staff assistance for lean on to help with planning the operations they must perform. \n\nPutting more emphasis on the brigade/regimental level command and staff.

For instance, many Ukrainian soldiers we spoke to spoke highly of M113s APCs and asked for more; No one asked for ATACMS, but almost everyone asked for M113s; Request for ATACMS was political rather than military driven, although again, everything depends on the numbers; My view is that if Ukrainian soldiers were to choose between hundreds of M113s and 20 ATACMS, they'd choose the former;\n\nThis backs two of my suspicions\n\n1. Atacms and himars in general were way over hyped. It's just a worse tochka, which Ukraine used hundreds of and the Russians were already used to counter \n\n2.

Everyone who is against socialism or communism is on the side I am on. This is my guiding principle, then we can have all the differences you want. In that group we have liberals, libertarians, people from the center, conservatives, from the center-right, but the limit is that no one crosses the limit of social democracy and all expressions further to the left. My alignment with Trump and Bolsonaro is almost natural.\"[121][248]\n\n> Milei's foreign policy proposals have been described as radical. In August 2023, he dismissed the possible participation of Argentina to\u00a0BRICS, said he would freeze relations with China, and have Argentina, South America's second-biggest economy, pull out of the\u00a0Mercosur\u00a0trade bloc with Brazil.[131]\u00a0Additionally, he scorned socialists in Latin America and abroad.

You will have to sit down and talk to the United Kingdom and discuss this situation with those who live on the islands.\"[60]\n\nDefinitely good news for the West if he follows through with his promises regarding China.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Javier Milei has won Argentina&#39;s General Election and will become the next president \n<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/argentina-readies-vote-likely-presidential-election-thriller-2023-11-19/\">https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/argentina-readies-vote-likely-presidential-election-thriller-2023-11-19/</a></p>\n\n<p>Here are his <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javier_Milei\">foreign policy views </a> from Wikipedia: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Milei supports former Brazilian president\u00a0Jair Bolsonaro\u00a0and former United States president\u00a0Donald Trump, especially their\u00a0anti-communism\u00a0and\u00a0criticism of socialism,[247][144]\u00a0and he has been compared to them for sharing an anti-leftist\u00a0and anti-social justice\u00a0platform.[86]\u00a0When asked about Trump and Bolsonaro, he said: &quot;I have a clear agenda, which goes against everything that is socialism or communism. Everyone who is against socialism or communism is on the side I am on. This is my guiding principle, then we can have all the differences you want. In that group we have liberals, libertarians, people from the center, conservatives, from the center-right, but the limit is that no one crosses the limit of social democracy and all expressions further to the left. My alignment with Trump and Bolsonaro is almost natural.&quot;[121][248]</p>\n\n<p>Milei&#39;s foreign policy proposals have been described as radical. In August 2023, he dismissed the possible participation of Argentina to\u00a0BRICS, said he would freeze relations with China, and have Argentina, South America&#39;s second-biggest economy, pull out of the\u00a0Mercosur\u00a0trade bloc with Brazil.[131]\u00a0Additionally, he scorned socialists in Latin America and abroad. Analysts stated that a breakdown of\u00a0Argentina\u2013China relations\u00a0could harm the Argentine economy. About China, Milei said: &quot;People are not free in China, they can&#39;t do what they want and when they do it, they get killed.

        "body": "There was some discussion in a previous thread about developments in Taiwan's presidential election. I was originally going to contribute some of my thoughts on the joint opposition presidential ticket and its implications for cross-strait and US-Taiwan relations only to wake up this morning to the news that the deal had fallen apart. \n\nI intended to include [this blogpost](https://frozengarlic.wordpress.com/2023/11/16/ko-gets-rolled/) from my favorite (English) commentator on Taiwanese politics, in which the author lists all the ways in which the joint ticket *could* fall apart, only for it to turn into a post-mortem on how the ticket *did* fall apart in only a few days. Lucky for us, Nathan managed to put out [a very thorough post](https://frozengarlic.wordpress.com/2023/11/18/the-big-reveal-goes-awry/) with his initial thoughts on the situation.\n\nAnd not to get too far away from defense matters, this situation and its possible outcomes has some serious implications on CCP/PLA thinking on a path toward \"re\"unification: If there is no TPP-KMT deal before tomorrow's deadline then that could mean an easy victory for current Vice President William Lai. Lai of course is seen as much more favorable to formal independence, so that could mean a more aggressive response form the CCP and a less stable situation in the strait.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>There was some discussion in a previous thread about developments in Taiwan&#39;s presidential election. I was originally going to contribute some of my thoughts on the joint opposition presidential ticket and its implications for cross-strait and US-Taiwan relations only to wake up this morning to the news that the deal had fallen apart. </p>\n\n<p>I intended to include <a href=\"https://frozengarlic.wordpress.com/2023/11/16/ko-gets-rolled/\">this blogpost</a> from my favorite (English) commentator on Taiwanese politics, in which the author lists all the ways in which the joint ticket <em>could</em> fall apart, only for it to turn into a post-mortem on how the ticket <em>did</em> fall apart in only a few days. Lucky for us, Nathan managed to put out <a href=\"https://frozengarlic.wordpress.com/2023/11/18/the-big-reveal-goes-awry/\">a very thorough post</a> with his initial thoughts on the situation.</p>\n\n<p>And not to get too far away from defense matters, this situation and its possible outcomes has some serious implications on CCP/PLA thinking on a path toward &quot;re&quot;unification: If there is no TPP-KMT deal before tomorrow&#39;s deadline then that could mean an easy victory for current Vice President William Lai. Lai of course is seen as much more favorable to formal independence, so that could mean a more aggressive response form the CCP and a less stable situation in the strait.

He conducted his forensic work without having any expertise or experience in the field, with a very selective work on sources and a lot of false or unconvincing proofs to make his points. In this context \"peer reviewed\" is also rather meaningless, as he's never been published by any journal where the reviewers have any academic expertise which would allow them to seriously examine his claims, sociologists aren't better armed to check bullet trajectories etc than any other profession; the fact they still decided to publish it, in spite of it having no relation whatsoever with their field of academic expertise, just speaks of them not being very serious either.\n\nExamples of the weaknesses of his work can be found [here](https://uamoderna.com/blogy/martynenko/answer-katchanovski/),  [here](http://ukraineanalysis.wordpress.com/2014/10/23/the-snipers-massacre-in-kyiv/) or [here](https://ukrainian-studies.ca/2014/12/01/taras-kuzio-study-ukrainian-nationalism-university-ottawa/) or [here](http://ivan-katchanovski.blogspot.com/), like with [the tree](https://rassian-fakes.livejournal.com/734.html) he uses as a proof by confusing the entry and exit holes to say it proves the shots came from behind the protesters rather than from the police barricade they were facing. The fact that some among the protesters were armed is also not contentious, but it is hardly proof that they shot their fellow protesters. There has been a long investigation on these matters already, and there are numerous videos showing Berkut shooting protesters.",

He conducted his forensic work without having any expertise or experience in the field, with a very selective work on sources and a lot of false or unconvincing proofs to make his points. In this context &quot;peer reviewed&quot; is also rather meaningless, as he&#39;s never been published by any journal where the reviewers have any academic expertise which would allow them to seriously examine his claims, sociologists aren&#39;t better armed to check bullet trajectories etc than any other profession; the fact they still decided to publish it, in spite of it having no relation whatsoever with their field of academic expertise, just speaks of them not being very serious either.</p>\n\n<p>Examples of the weaknesses of his work can be found <a href=\"https://uamoderna.com/blogy/martynenko/answer-katchanovski/\">here</a>,  <a href=\"http://ukraineanalysis.wordpress.com/2014/10/23/the-snipers-massacre-in-kyiv/\">here</a> or <a href=\"https://ukrainian-studies.ca/2014/12/01/taras-kuzio-study-ukrainian-nationalism-university-ottawa/\">here</a> or <a href=\"http://ivan-katchanovski.blogspot.com/\">here</a>, like with <a href=\"https://rassian-fakes.livejournal.com/734.html\">the tree</a> he uses as a proof by confusing the entry and exit holes to say it proves the shots came from behind the protesters rather than from the police barricade they were facing. The fact that some among the protesters were armed is also not contentious, but it is hardly proof that they shot their fellow protesters. There has been a long investigation on these matters already, and there are numerous videos showing Berkut shooting protesters.</p>\n</div>",
