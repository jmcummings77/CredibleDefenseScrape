                                    "body": "\n\n\nLet me as you a question: have you ever live in Vietnam, no, not just that, but lived long enough to blend in with the locals, accustomed to the society, political landscape, and the locals are close enough to you to open about their political views? That thing is hard to achieve if you're an expat, since the majority of expat live in a higher income closed neighborhood, the Vietnamese people around them also come from the same background so they have a different political views from the bigger majority of population.\n\n\nSo let we talk back to the survey question. I will divide it into physical surveys and online surveys. Let talk about the online survey first. For starters, how do you advertise people to join and did the survey? Vietnam most popular social media is facebook, Zalo and tiktok. But how do you pull as much people as possible to conduct it with the ideal to take people with different cultural, demographic, gender, social status, education knowledge,... as possible. There's many social media influencers tricks to make a post go viral online but that usually attracts a certain type of audience( hence the demographic) more. Let say, the group of people, middle aged, from the cities, 50% from the north, 40% from the south and 10% from the middle, their political views is divided into conservatives and liberal, with the views of them about USA is much more positive in the south but less in the north and the middle. So you conduct the survey, but only a small percentage of that demographic join in, with 80% from the south and the rest from the north+ middle. If you ask about the views of them about USA, of course you would get an overly positive view because the participants in that demographic group overwhelmingly from the south and have positive opinions due to history. But does it represent the whole demographic group? That's not to mention the question itself can skew the answer. For example, people in the north will have positive opinions about Russia as they see Russia as the successor of USSR, the main supporter of North Vietnam during the war. But the people in tourist attractions cities like Nha Trang, \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng would have mixed answers: these cities have huge population of Russian expats and tourists. For the business owners that their jobs tied to expats/tourists, their opinion would be more positive, but for the average citizen, many would have negative opinions due to many bad experiences of Russian tourists drunks, loudly, even thief or robbery or scam. Then the views about China. In the north, for the majority across the demographic, the views about China is negative, but the increasing trade volume between China and Vietnam, many people who trade with China have more positive views, while a part of young generations that consume Chinese media( games, novels, movies etc) would have more positive views. In the south, the views can be negative, as historical background and Southern Vietnam is the main trading hub of Vietnam with the rest of the world( including the west) while the north is the main trading hub with East asia. However, in Ch\u1ee3 l\u1edbn region of HCM city and other places witj remains of Chinese community that still survives after 1979 expulsion, they have more positive views about China as their fatherland. So in a question like: do you prefer Russia or USA, the answer from southern participants will more likely Russia for the North and more likely USA for the south, while in the question \"would you choose USA or China\", there would be more choose USA, it's not because the majority love USA, but because they hate China more. But again it's just a sample of a huge population 100 millions, and that's just opinion of people you surveyed.\n\n\nIf you do the surveys in English, it would attract people with higher education ( knowing English), they usually with higher income, office jobs and have more liberal views. So can you see how difficult it is to conduct surveys online? It's even more so as Vietnam internet space is in top 5 of most toxic in the world. There are a lot of people with very extremist views but are loudest. Or a group of people would claim to be native Vietnamese, however, they're Viet Kieu, aka the Vietnamese diaspora overseas community. The group of Viet Kieu that live in the five eyes country but especially USA, would be more attracted to join a survey in all Viet Kieu groups if you conduct surveys in English, their political views would be more negative about Vietnamese government and positive about US due to the scar as they're descendants of people that fleed the war after 1975\n\n\n\nAnd if you think the surveys online already biased due to reason above, the physical survey is even more so because it's very attached to the place, time, participants of the location the survey conducted. So let say you're a foreign correspondent that go to Vietnam to conduct surveys, where would you choose to do? Clearly you don't have enough resources to survey it in all the places, you can only do it in big cities like Hanoi or HCM city. But where do you put the survey since these cities also huge. Hanoi population is 8,5m and HCM is over 10m. Then how do you attract the participants? You put a vendor in middle of the street? You go and ask random strangers? It's very problematic since you can only know a sample of people who in a particular city in a particular place and particular time.\n\n\nThere's two methods i see the foreign journalists usually use when they conduct the survey: they go to universities and ask around the campus or invite the students to join a meeting then do a survey. By that way they can amass more participants as young adults want to try everything and express their views about the world( and joining meetings, especially by foreign entities like this can help their career post graduate). But well, their views is not exactly ideal to represent the whole population views. There's another method that they send invite to various online groups for a meeting and conduct surveys during it. This can attract more high quality participants ( government officials, businesses owners, journalists,...compared to college students who just a year or two ago they still considered kids). However, this method although better, itself also have flaws: it can only attract people that can prepare schedule to join the meeting, and participants themselves have some interests in it( like business owners trying to find new customers, or journalists building more connections) so their answer, many may not be honest. \n\n\n\nI don't claim to be more educated than people here, far from it and I'm trying to learn more. But I've lived long enough to understand that politics in the \"other countries\" is not as simple and straightforward as people in western social media such as Reddit think based on few surveys. And in all, what important is not the public opinion but how the government think. Public opinion can also be controlled via media. It is  not unique to Vietnam either, in USA media tycoons also catered to each of the political groups. But in Vietnam it is less subtle about it and there's only one option: what official media say is what the government wants the public to know about politics.",

I'm relying more on \"common knowledge\" so I might not have gotten it all completely right; Wages of Destruction is one of the go-to books for the Nazi economy so that's what I'd recommend for further reading.\n\nAs for why, that's well beyond my knowledge, but one reason I've heard is that Nazi leadership wanted to shelter the standard of living in Germany proper so as to insulate their support base from the real costs of war. In addition to insane deficit spending, the Nazi government could also utilize (and loot) their various \"acquisitions\" like France, Poland, and Czechoslovakia for both resources and production. I suppose it all fell in line with the whole *Lebensraum* framework, whereby there would be \"border fortresses/settlements\" to fight the barbarians and lesser peoples while extracting and shipping resources to the economic center in Germany.
