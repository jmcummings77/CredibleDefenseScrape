Their calculus changes due to battlefield defeats and victories, not how many Leopards we give.  \n\nThere is a real escalation ladder (NATO targets firing at Russian targets or vice versa) that we're yet to even touch.\n\n>I also think Iran is in a far more precious position than they appear.

On the other hand, we don't have proxies, at least not ones Iran will hit.  The next step on their ladder is hitting us, this time harder.\n\nSo they have more wiggle room than we do.

Their calculus changes due to battlefield defeats and victories, not how many Leopards we give.  </p>\n\n<p>There is a real escalation ladder (NATO targets firing at Russian targets or vice versa) that we&#39;re yet to even touch.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I also think Iran is in a far more precious position than they appear. While a middle eastern conflict would hurt the Biden administration\u2019s chance at reelection it would be a existential threat to the Iranian regime.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What you&#39;re missing is that we won&#39;t start by hitting Iran, we&#39;ll start by hitting their proxies, and they have a lot of proxies to hit.  On the other hand, we don&#39;t have proxies, at least not ones Iran will hit.  The next step on their ladder is hitting us, this time harder.</p>\n\n<p>So they have more wiggle room than we do.  If American soldiers die we still won&#39;t invade Iran, we&#39;ll just bomb their proxies, so Iran loses little.  If American soldiers die Biden gets a shit sandwich politically.</p>\n</div>",

Here is the video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoRT\\_gu7PFQ&ab\\_channel=AndrewPerpetua](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoRT_gu7PFQ&ab_channel=AndrewPerpetua), the part where he goes over Avdeevka is time stamped in the video itself.\n\nStarts off by saying that its a mess for both sides. Doesn't know what Ukraine's reserves or motivations are, wants to avoid making criticisms about those. Will stick with what he sees is happening.\n\nBackground: Says Ukraine knew Russia was going to attack Avdeevka a while before Russia did attack. Fighting started around October 1st,  and ramped up in intensity until the 10th which is when the large assaults took place. Ukraine appeared to stop the assault for the first week or so by using a large amount of ammunition, and now appear to be running low on ammo again. Russia capitalizing on this by using infantry.\n\nAssault on Krasnohorivka: Russia assaulting three different angles. North of Krasnohorivka toward Novokalynove, west toward Stepove, and Southwest toward the slag heap/coke plant. Thinks Russia has captured the slag heap(slag heap isn't contested by Ukraine) and are occupying tunnels inside. Thinks Russia has probably made it to the rail line(worth noting Deepstate has Russia at the rail line).\n\nAssualts: says Russia is massing infantry at treelines to take positions(weight in numbers). Says best counter to this is mortars + drones, but Ukraine doesn't have enough mortar ammunition to repel such styles of assaults.\n\nHypotheticals: Claims that when Ukraine did their offensive(Tokmak offensive), they ran out of ammo and stopped. Then they got more ammo and used it to continue the offensive. Maybe they shouldn't have used that ammo to continue the offensive, maybe should have used it to defend. Personally thinks Ukraine should have stopped the Tokmak offensive in July and cut their losses by then.\n\nUkrainian response: Could dip into more reserves of artillery/mortar ammuntion. Says this will only make Ukraine run out of ammo faster. Ukraine could also try to counterattack, but such counterattacks will incur substantial casualties.\n\nFinal thoughts: Situation is very up in the air at the moment. Doesn't know how much reserves Russia has in infantry and armor to continue their assault. Doesn't know how many casualties Russia is willing to sustain. Notes that Russia might opt to sustain more casualties/kilometer because they simply don't have to advance much farther(1 - 2 kilometers). Says most people believe Ukraine stops the assault, but says there is a very real possibility that Russia captures Avdeevka.\n\nOther interesting info: Says that a lot of people on twitter claiming all summer that Russia was about to run out of reserves and that Ukraine was on the verge of breaking through were dead wrong. It turns out that Ukraine was never even close to breaking through, but troops that people claimed Russia was sending to Tokmak from Kremmina and Luhansk were actually being sent to Avdeevka for this offensive.",

Instead, there were existing trends, either represented or augmented by the rise of Donald Trump, that have undermined G.O.P. coherence and made the Republican House practically ungovernable in the current circumstances.\n\n>The conservative movement has warred against the party establishment since its inception.\n\n...\n\n> In the last Congress, Nancy Pelosi had a slim majority like Mr. McCarthy and a restive handful of members on her left flank, the so-called Squad.

Due to \nthe research that has been conducted in different countries, considerable progress has been made \nin addressing the engineering issues, but a lot remains to be done, particularly in the areas of \nadvanced materials and composites. &quot;</li>\n</ol>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Hypersonic Weapons\u2013A Technological Challenge for Allied Nations and NATO?

Why would the Chinese launch an attack on CONUS at all?\n\n>  If there were mainland strikes, they would target military infrastructure because those would be far more valuable to a conflict.\n\nWhat is military infrastructure? Are we talking only about military bases? Can we consider port infrastructure? Power plants? Oil refineries? What about a conventional attack on the PLA's headquarters? There is plenty of dual use infrastructure in China that the US could argue to be legitimate military targets. You're talking about attacks on mainland China, probably with weapons launched from far away, in a contested ISR environment. I guarantee you we'd end up hitting civilian infrastructure. That's what the Chinese are afraid of, and that's what's lopsided. Maybe the US will be nice, and won't bomb any oil refineries, in which case I don't think China will be launching any conventional ICBMs. But if we start thinking we can hit Chinese infrastructure with impunity, then this is their deterrent for that.",

Are we talking only about military bases? Can we consider port infrastructure? Power plants? Oil refineries? What about a conventional attack on the PLA&#39;s headquarters? There is plenty of dual use infrastructure in China that the US could argue to be legitimate military targets. You&#39;re talking about attacks on mainland China, probably with weapons launched from far away, in a contested ISR environment. I guarantee you we&#39;d end up hitting civilian infrastructure. That&#39;s what the Chinese are afraid of, and that&#39;s what&#39;s lopsided. Maybe the US will be nice, and won&#39;t bomb any oil refineries, in which case I don&#39;t think China will be launching any conventional ICBMs. But if we start thinking we can hit Chinese infrastructure with impunity, then this is their deterrent for that.</p>\n</div>",

What you quoted from my previous comment is an explanation of how MAD could possibly be nullified altogether. Let's set aside the \"overwhelming retaliation\" part. If the dozen or so ICBMs are nuclear, then there must be a nuclear response, according to MAD theory. To not retaliate at all would be to incentive further use by the opponent. So if the US responds with an equivalent amount of nuclear weapons, what do you think happens at that point? An escalatory spiral ensures the eventual massive strike.

ICBMs in the air force all the aforementioned considerations, with the end point being that, even if there are only a dozen of them, the possibility of them being nuclear and possibly degrading retaliatory capability enough to impact the outcome of a nuclear exchange, combined with the likelihood of an escalatory spiral, means that the option for massive nuclear retaliation is rationally on the table when even a handful of incoming ICBMs are detected.\n\n>You are choosing to focus on this step as the end, saying that this step is the unthinkable one.\n\nNo, I'm choosing to focus on the introduction of conventional ICBMs as a consideration in peer conflicts.

The justification for retaliation is much simpler: you nuked me, so I nuke you. The argument for immediate launch is that retaliation might be impossible if you wait, so you need to do it now, before you lose the ability to do so. That's the *only* justification for immediate launch, because as long as I don't threaten your nukes, you can just wait the 30 minutes to see if I really did nuke you or not, and it won't affect your ability to retaliate at all. It is not rational to end the world on the *possibility* that an attack was nuclear, if your ability to wage nuclear war is unharmed by the attack. You are turning a possible nuclear holocaust into a guaranteed one.\n\nIf China really does nuke us with a \"limited\" strike, then yeah, the calculus becomes different. In that case it could easily be rational to launch a massive strike in response, because you see the escalation spiral won't stop. But that's not an immediate launch, and that won't apply in the case of a conventional ICBM.\n\n>  massive nuclear retaliation is rationally on the table \n\nYeah, absolutely if you see ICBMs flying at you, it should be on the table. That's what I mean by feature of the attack, and not the weapon. What if we see 5 missiles heading towards San Diego? We know that this wouldn't threaten our second strike, so it would not be rational to guarantee a nuclear response before the missiles have even landed. \n\n> Conventional ICBMs erase a clear red line that used to delineate a definitive nuclear threshold. \n\nI completely agree, however that red line is *not nuclear*. However escalatory a conventional ICBM attack is, and it's definitely escalatory, it does not cross the nuclear threshold. My main contention is that it is not rational to commit to nuclear war when there is only a slim possibility you are facing a nuclear attack. \n\nAgain, I'm not saying we should just let them hit us, and then try to talk them down.

Whatever planning Iran had in the attacks, at most it was likely in a facilitation role similar to the Taliban with 9/11.\n\nFor the most part, Tehran appeared to be occupied with other issues. The nuclear program, selling drones to Russia and outsourcing production there, establishing a detente with Saudi Arabia, and quelling internal dissent. Attacking Israel appeared distant until Israeli-Saudi normalization talks started heating up again. Hezbollah, on the other hand, appeared more engaged with fixing its position in Lebanon, with the Lebanese economy ailing and its relations with the Maronite minority worsening due to an accident with a military truck in a village. Neither really appeared to be interested in engaging Israel, if ever. It goes into a paradox where the existence of Israel justifies the existence of the IR/Hezbollah but that's a bit more cosmic.\n\nAt the very least, Israel have a rough endgame with addressing the Hamas problem. Hamas and its allies truly got the \"You're Winner!\" screen by forcing a war it cannot survive and losing international legitimacy. Which puts Iran and Hezbollah in a very awkward position.\n\nPart of Hezbollah's \"social contract\" is the eventual destruction of what it sees as the \"Zionist colonial state\" and the establishment of a full Palestinean state. I'm going to see this from their eyes, not mine: the elected government  of Gaza and its territory is being threatened by Israel, whose actions are never legitimate. Therefore, as part of the social contract, Hezbollah must respond.\n\nYet Hezbollah is bluffing to some extent. Hezbollah knows that it cannot realistically launch a full-scale invasion of Israel without suffering horrific casualties, and the territory gained would be paltry. Hezbollah has no war economy, a small man-pool to draw from, lack of resupply, and Lebanon's population does not want to engage in a conflict they see as being irrelevant with the country going through one of the worst recessions recorded in history. If Hezbollah pushes to Tel Aviv, they'll suffer losses from both the Israeli Air Force and a Western response; for them, this is unsustainable as they cannot regenerate like say Russia or Ukraine. What does a win look like here? Realistically, they can only engage in fixing attacks and missile strikes.\n\nIran's options are even fewer. They can't mobilize, have not many areas to stage incursions anyway, and outside of Hezbollah only have their allied militias in Iraq. Iran has even fewer options compared to Russia with its war with Ukraine. The Israeli-Saudi deal would complicate things, but I suspect they already had a contingency plan based on their frantic response.\n\nBasically, this whole thing is a casino table where everyone is just staring at each other and reacting rather than any particular person having a deep plan. Saudi Arabia is kinda seething in the background with a \"not this bullshit\" type of posture with the United States trying to prevent shit from totally hitting the fan.\n\nIt reminds me of the Arthur episode \"Desk Wars\" where the whole class is stuck in class on a hot day and is at each other's throat, threatening to retaliate if one thing happens, leading to a whole accidental chain reaction.",

Seriously?\n\nVery few if any nations in history were ever truly willing to fight to the last man.  That whole notion reminds me of the whole \"totalerkrieg\" speech by Goebbels in ww2, where he declared that this is a war for the existence and triumph of the German people.\n\nGermany... didn't fight to the last man in ww2.  In fact, they weren't even close.

This morning, Hamas launched a murderous surprise attack against the State of Israel and its citizens. We have been in this since the early morning hours.\n\nHe says Israel is at war, then mentions the attack, however, he does not say Israel is at war with Hamas.\n\nThe actual press release stating that war was declared was released on Oct 8, 2023.  This is the title [Security Cabinet Approves War Situation](https://www.gov.il/en/departments/news/spoke-war081023). Basic Law (Israel's defacto Constitution) Article 40 is the Declaration of War clause.\n\n>Last night, the Security Cabinet approved the war situation and, to this end, the taking of significant military steps, as per Article 40 of Basic Law: The Government.  \n>  \n>The war that was forced on the State of Israel in a murderous terrorist assault from the Gaza Strip began at 06:00 yesterday (Saturday, 7 October 2023).\n\nAs one can see in the press release, there is no mention of Hamas or any other organization. This is kept deliberately vague so the government of Israel isn't bound to any goal or even opponent.\n\nIsraeli politicians can say a lot of stuff, but what is written down is more important. Often reporters can interpret statements as they want to get rid of Hamas even though they never actually said it.\n\nYou need to go to primary written documents instead of second-hand sources or verbal statements by Israel politicians.\n\nIf you read through all Prime Minister of Israel press briefings, a pattern emerges, in they never specify Hamas as the enemy. Why?\n\nThe reason why it's vague is the attackers were not all from Hamas. Not all Hamas members participated in the attack.\n\nThe last thing Netanyahu want is for Israeli and Western reporters to go snopping around Hamas documents after they are totally defeated, and find transfers from Israel to Hamas. Secret communications between Hamas and Shinbet etc.  Hamas internal documents showing how shoddy Israel's intelligence services are.\n\nHamas isn't like AQ, they were right next door to Israel. The contact between the Israeli government and Hamas was extensive.\n\nIt would be nice if Hamas just disappeared along with all their documents. But that isn't going to happen.\n\nNetanyahu is the smartest PM Israel has ever had. The problem is he is corrupt and self-serving.",

Following the assassination of the Rwandan President, the Hutu ethnic majority perpetrated a genocide against the Tutsi minority. This involved not only the military but also civilian militias, known as Interahamwe, who carried out brutal massacres often following behind the movements of the military or in areas behind the lines of the Rwandan military that couldn't be reached or policed by the few UN Peacekeepers or the Rwandan Patriotic Front forces. There's a reason the vast majority of victims were murdered by machete, a common work tool, normal working people grabbed whatever was at hand and joined in the killings.\n\nAlso the Cambodian Genocide, The Khmer Rouge regime, led by Pol Pot, was responsible for the deaths of approximately 1.7 million people. This included mass killings carried out by both military personnel, but quite a lot of civilians voluntarily joined in and took the opportunity to murder and loot. Similar to the Rwandan genocide, neighbors and otherwise common people were the perpetrators in a mass ideological pogrom which among its many victims had the intelligentsia or anyone remotely associated with the concept of the intelligentsia (People who wore glasses were murdered because of the association of wearing glasses or near sightedness with intelligence or higher education and science). Again the weapon of choice for the Killing Fields were tools such as scythes, picks, or nails and hammers.\n\nIn the Bosnian War, there were instances of ethnic cleansing where civilians, often organized into militias, participated in the mass killing and expulsion of people from opposing ethnic groups.\n\nIn the Kosovo war between Serbian forces and ethnic Albanian separatists, paramilitary groups and civilian militias engaged in ethnic cleansing, including murders, rapes, and looting.\n\nDuring Sherman's march to the sea, many of the atrocities which are attributed the Sherman were actually perpetrated by camp followers and deserters called \"bummers\" that followed the Union army looting and pillaging.\n\nIt's important to note that virtually all of these examples there's the unfortunate situation where many who were forced into committing atrocities under the very real threat of summary execution for not doing so or voicing any opposition. In the Rwandan Genocide those militias I mentioned did this, forcibly conscripting any Hutu they found and forcing them to murder, rape, etc. In the Cambodian Genocide. the Khmer Rouge specifically used child soldiers, for all the awful reasons you can imagine like children and adolescents being easier to manipulate and indoctrinate with ideological propaganda, they listen to and obey authority more readily while asking fewer questions, as before they were disposable with any dissenters being promptly killed.
