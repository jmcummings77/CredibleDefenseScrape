I see nuclear escalation as a fairly low probability in general. However, you know even on some of the more challenging moments of the Cold War people like Khruschev saw the likelihood of nuclear escalation in say, the Berlin Crisis, at I think around 5%, and that was considered quite high. So in the nuclear escalation business, low probabilities are still actually considered to be rather high given prospective outcomes.\u201d - Michael Kofman, 9/21/2022  \n\n\n\u201cThe threat of nuclear was is still incredibly low. There is a reason why we haven\u2019t used them since 1945.\u201d - Andrey Baklitskiy, Nuclear arms control and nonproliferation expert at the UN Institute for Disarmament Research  \n\n\n\u201cDespite this threatening rhetoric, Putin\u2019s partial mobilization of Russia\u2019s conventional forces may actually lower the risk of Russian use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine - at least for now.\u201d - Caitlin Talmadge, Professor of Security Studies in the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University  \n\n\n\u201cI think \\[his recent threat\\] signals that he wants people to think he would risk nuclear war, I don\u2019t think it means he is any more likely to do it than he was yesterday.\u201d - Phillips O\u2019Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews  \n\n\n\u201cReshetnikoy told Al Jazeera that the prospect of Russia using tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine was \u201cimpossible and would make little military sense\u201d right now.\u201d - Al Jazeera citing Leonid Reshetnikov, former Lieutenant-General of Foreign Intelligence Service and former Director fo the Russian Institute for Strategic Studies  \n\n\n\u201cRussia will not likely use nuclear weapons on the front line.\u201d - Marck Cancian, military expert from the Center for Strategic and International Studies  \n\n\nThere are many other experts making essentially the same conclusions as listed above, but it\u2019s impossible to collate them all and put them in context.  \n\n\nA counterpoint of sorts:  \n\n\n\u201cWe are moving into uncharted waters. Putin is burning bridges behind him by mobilizing troops and holding sham referendums to annex Ukrainian territory. If his strategy doesn\u2019t work, he may feel compelled to lash out.\u201d - Dara Massicot, Rand Corporation  \n\n\n**WHAT WOULD RUSSIAN NUCLEAR USE LOOK LIKE IN UKRAINE?**  \n\n\nJon Wolfsthal, former White House nuclear advisor, senior advisor at Global Zero, and member of the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists\u2019 Science and Security Board, has laid out three possible scenarios for Russian nuclear use:  \n\n\nA nuclear weapon strikes to demonstrate resolve. A small nuclear weapon detonated over the Black Sea, for example.  \n\n\nA nuclear attack in Ukraine to achieve a tactical goal (disrupting a counter-offensive) or a strategic strike on Ukrainian command and control (a direct strike against Kyiv).  \n\n\nAn extreme scenario of a preemptive strike against NATO (highly unlikely)  \n\n\nThese scenarios, namely 1 and 2, are widely accepted among experts as the likely Russian usage of nuclear weapons in Ukraine.  \n\n\n**WHAT WOULD A WESTERN RESPONSE TO NUCLEAR WEAPONS ENTAIL?**  \n\n\n\u201cWe have communicated directly, privately and at very high levels to the Kremlin that any use of nuclear weapons will be met with catastrophic consequences for Russia, that the US and our allies will respond decisively, and we have been clear and specific about what that will entail.\u201d - Jake Sullivan, US National Security Advisor, 9/25/2022  \n\n\n\u201cRussia would become more of a pariah in the world than they ever have been. Depending on the extent of what they do, will determine what response would occur.\u201d - US President Joe Biden, 9/17/2022  \n\n\n\u201cThe bottom line here is that there would be no easy answer or simple solutions should Putin go nuclear. The stakes could not be higher and the need to deter Putin from using a nuclear weapon to the extent possible is clear.\u201d - Jon Wolfsthal  \n\n\n\u201cRussian nuclear use might provide an opening to convince countries that have so far been reluctant, such as India and possibly even China, to participate in escalating sanctions.\u201d - Matthew Kroeing, Atlantic Council  \n\n\nJeffrey Edmonds, researcher at the CNA Russia Studies Program, lays out a number of potential response scenarios ([https://thebulletin.org/2022/05/potential-us-responses-to-the-russian-use-of-non-strategic-nuclear-weapons-in-ukraine/](https://thebulletin.org/2022/05/potential-us-responses-to-the-russian-use-of-non-strategic-nuclear-weapons-in-ukraine/)):  \n\n\nResponding in kind: Firing a nuclear weapon at a Russian target in response  \n\n\nConventional response and escalation: Striking Russian military targets in Ukraine or targeting the Russian platform that launched the weapon  \n\n\nStaying the course: Continue to provide weapons to Ukraine and increase sanctions  \n\n\nPush for settlement: US and the West push to immediately bring Ukraine and Russia to the table and end the conflict as quickly as possible  \n\n\nMichael Kofman declined to comment on what his advice would be re: how to respond to Russian nuclear use",

There is a shortage of specialists in the world right now, they are recruited, they are competed for, and we hand them over to a bullet, a knife, and an 82mm mine. This human capital is worth hundreds of millions and saves lives worth billions, creating technological parity for those at the front of the simple and mass professions, and somewhere an advantage on the battlefield. Come to think of it, the cycle of restoration of the former production capacity from 10 years, and taking into account the losses of educational and personnel potential in such quantity\u2014not less than 20 years. <strong>You will simply bury the industry.</strong> I do not know who made this decision and who is issuing subpoenas to the people working at these enterprises. But it is simply sabotage or the most terrible stupidity with professional incompetence, when they cannot calculate the economy and the cost of human capital.</p>\n\n<p>Sincerely, Kostromin Vasily Vladimirovich<br/>\nVasily Kostromin, CEO of Fraxis technology company<br/>\nSoftware products, IoT and instrumentation</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

To stay in Moscow Snowden had to turn traitor. So now if he comes back he\u2019ll almost certainly be tried for treason, likely found guilty, and possibly shot.</p>\n</div>",

Lacking trucks, the army is tethered to its railheads.\n\n> * The best the Kremlin can hope for, as far as mobilization outcomes go, is to bulk up existing battalions with a lot of under-trained, poorly-armed draftees who might be able to sit in a trench not far from a rail depot and inaccurately shoot at any Ukrainian forces attacking them, but who lack any ability to conduct attacks of their own.\n\n> * Small wars against weak countries along the Russian border also don\u2019t require Russian forces to travel far from their country\u2019s railheads.\n\n> * So of course the Kyiv assault failed after just a month. It ran out of supplies because it ran out of trucks. Russian truck losses continued to mount as the war dragged on. Independent analysts have confirmed nearly 1,700 wrecked or captured trucks out of a prewar inventory of around 4,400.\n\n------------------\n\nI am curious if Russia is in fact lacking heavy trucks as this article suggests. I do not understand why civilian trucks could not be painted green and pressed into military service for use farther away from the front line. Russia does have the cash to buy vital things like trucks, and China and India both have large commercial truck industries.

Lacking trucks, the army is tethered to its railheads.</p></li>\n<li><p>The best the Kremlin can hope for, as far as mobilization outcomes go, is to bulk up existing battalions with a lot of under-trained, poorly-armed draftees who might be able to sit in a trench not far from a rail depot and inaccurately shoot at any Ukrainian forces attacking them, but who lack any ability to conduct attacks of their own.</p></li>\n<li><p>Small wars against weak countries along the Russian border also don\u2019t require Russian forces to travel far from their country\u2019s railheads.</p></li>\n<li><p>So of course the Kyiv assault failed after just a month. It ran out of supplies because it ran out of trucks. Russian truck losses continued to mount as the war dragged on. Independent analysts have confirmed nearly 1,700 wrecked or captured trucks out of a prewar inventory of around 4,400.</p></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>I am curious if Russia is in fact lacking heavy trucks as this article suggests. I do not understand why civilian trucks could not be painted green and pressed into military service for use farther away from the front line. Russia does have the cash to buy vital things like trucks, and China and India both have large commercial truck industries. Trucks could be purchased in the open and are not overtly military aid that would trigger western sanctions either.</p>\n</div>",

Which is all to say that big macro numbers may seem like apples to applies, but they\u2019re not. What matters is the drivers of contraction because that indicates how bad the damage is and how quick the recovery will be. In two years the US will (probably) be fine. In two years I doubt Russias economy will be fine.</p>\n</div>",

After all they will only increase their defence budget from 1.3% to 2%, and it is unlikely that they will spend a larger proportion of that. Germany also has significant areas where they can cut, with little to no impact on the domestic economy. One example is development aid, where Germany spent 0.74% of its GDP in 2021. Redirecting those funds into defence spending alone, could compensate for the increased defence budget, and would not entail any increase in government spending. Of course, they can\u2019t cut their entire foreign aid budget, but my point is that the increased defence spending is only 0,7% of gdp and would therefore not entail massive tax increases of significant decreases in social spending. \n\nThis point also applies to Europe as a whole. Europe spends far more on foreign aid than the United States, in part due to the fact that they spend less on defence. Reducing the foreign aid could therefore come a long way to paying for any increases in defence spending.\n\nIn addition, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s nessecary to spend more than 2%. If 2% of the European gdp was spent on defence, the total defence spending would be close to 360 billion dollars. That estimate discounts countries such as Poland who aim to spend 5% as well as the UK which will always be an important player in European defence. That is more than enough to defeat Russia, even without the United States. And if you struggle with defeating Russia after spending 360 billion, then the issue isn\u2019t money, but how you spend it.",

Shoot at the troops on the front, target their rear with indirect fire. Attack their command and control, logistics depots and conduct a mix of partisan/SOF attacks in the deep rear. Concentrate fire and forces in places and times of opportunity. Take ground where profitable, give where reasonable.\n\nWhy should Ukraine change their strategy? The Russian mobilization will make it harder obviously, but the war was never going to be easy. Russian mobilization was always a possibility and a probability. In the end it is just additional biomass that needs to be processed.\n\nHow would Ukraine change their strategy? What capabilities Ukraine has hidden that they thus far have refrained from deploying?

The difference was that the country was occupied for years and the populace had to go through essentially a cultural purge of sorts. That's what Russia would need if it ever came to that.\n\nIt's not just Putin&political elite who have fostered this dangerous drive towards war of conquest, it's the Russian national consciousness that has contributed heavily to this.

        "body": "My thoughts on conscription of Ukrainians:\n\n1. Are you going to conscript pro Ukrainian men, literally most extreme example being trying to recruit POWs for any role?\nAnswer: no for combat obviously, but also no for even any role outside of combat. Too much risk of sabotage, defecting, spying, etc. Only work is going to be far away camp work under close supervision. This probably applies to most of men. \n\n2. Are you going to recruit neutrals or \"eh\" men who seemingly aren't pro Ukrainian?\nAnswer: yes, but don't give them guns.

The drones evaded the soldiers\u2019 defenses and dropped bombs on their position, destroying two tanks with their crews inside.  \n>  \n>\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to see these drones on radars,\u201d said Arekhta, who traveled to Washington, D.C., last week as part of a delegation of female Ukrainian soldiers. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge problem.\u201d  \n>  \n>Over the past week, Russia has deployed Shahed and Mohajer combat drones imported from Iran in greater numbers across Ukraine, with devastating results. Some hit combat positions, smashing tanks and armored vehicles, while others struck civilian infrastructure, including in the port city of Odesa.  \n>  \n>In his nightly address on Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country\u2019s anti-aircraft forces had shot down more than a dozen drones in the eastern Dnipropetrovsk region and Odesa. The Ukrainian Air Force identified them as Shahed-136 kamikaze drones and Mohajer-6 drones that carry munitions and can also be used for reconnaissance.  \n>  \n>But in interviews, a Ukrainian activist and three soldiers said the Iranian drones pose a major threat to both fighters and civilians. Their arrival on the battlefield makes the need for the West to send additional modern weaponry even more urgent, as Kyiv tries to seize on recent gains to retake as much territory as possible before winter sets in, they said.  \n>  \n>The Iranian drones appear to be a potential game-changer for the Russians. They are relatively small and fly at low altitude, evading Ukrainian radars. Arekhta said she could shoot them down with Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, but only during the day because the U.S.-provided weapons do not come with a night-vision system.  \n>  \n>Ukraine needs modern air defenses, such as the Counter-Rocket, Artillery and Mortar systems the U.S. used in Afghanistan, and 360-degree radar to counter the new threat, the visiting group said.  \n>  \n>\u201cI need to be in position against Russian helicopters on one side and Iranian drones came from another side,\u201d Arekhta said. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to close the huge area with Stingers, with other weapons that can hit these drones.\u201d  \n>  \n>Arekhta uses the Switchblade 300 drones provided by Washington, but they are essentially commercial systems that are not powerful enough to work against armored vehicles and artillery, she said. Ukraine needs the upgraded Switchblade 600 drones, a loitering munition she described as \u201ca flying Javelin.\u201d  \n>  \n>Washington has contracted with manufacturer AeroVironment to send the 600 version, but they likely won\u2019t arrive for many months.  \n>  \n>Ukrainian forces are now fighting the Russians on two fronts: advancing east from the Oskil River into the contested Donbas region, and south from Kherson. After an initial breakthrough at the beginning of the month during which Kyiv recaptured much of the Russian-occupied Kharkiv region, gains have slowed significantly. Ukrainian soldiers are now pushing into the entrenched Donbas, where the two sides have been essentially deadlocked since 2014.  \n>  \n>In the Donetsk oblast, the battle is now more difficult because Russian forces are fighting from trenches and shelters built years ago, said Ivanna Chobaniuk, a medic who was serving near Kharkiv before she traveled to D.C. last week.  \n>  \n>In the northeast, Ukrainian soldiers are trying to retake ground using Toyotas and other civilian cars \u2014 which are particularly vulnerable to drone attack \u2014 because their old armored vehicles were destroyed, Chobaniuk said.  \n>  \n>The old Soviet-era tanks Kyiv operates have a myriad of problems, Arekhta said. The soldiers frequently get error messages when using the aiming system and there is no fire protection system, forcing them to use a small fire extinguisher on the outside of the tank if they are hit. The tanks don\u2019t connect to the soldiers\u2019 Western-provided radios, so Arekhta has to use her cell phone to communicate. In the winter, \u201cSoviet tank doesn\u2019t work at all,\u201d she said.  \n>  \n>Kyiv needs modern tanks, Bradley Fighting Vehicles and Humvees to help Ukraine\u2019s forces advance in the face of heavy Russian artillery, the soldiers said.  \n>  \n>\u201cIt is now when we have momentum,\u201d said Daria Kaleniuk, the head of the Ukrainian nonprofit the Anti-Corruption Action Center. \u201cWe keep counterattacking and counterattacking in Toyotas, in civilian cars \u2014 it is very inconvenient, especially if Iranian drones are flying over.\u201d  \n>  \n>Kyiv is trying to recapture as much ground as possible before winter sets in, the soldiers said. But now they have a new problem: in response to their counteroffensive, Vladimir Putin has mobilized 300,000 reservists to fight in Ukraine.  \n>  \n>While there are questions about the quality of the soldiers Putin has called up, Russia will use the colder months, when fighting typically slows, to train and equip them, the Ukrainian soldiers said.  \n>  \n>\u201cIf we give them that time, in spring there will be an epic battle \u2014 another epic battle,\u201d said Daria Zubenko, a senior sergeant who has served as a paramedic and sniper.  \n>  \n>Ukraine could use the winter to train its forces on more advanced weapons that the West has not yet greenlighted \u2014 for instance, modern battle tanks and fighter jets, Kaleniuk said. The Ukrainian Armed Forces two weeks ago submitted an official letter of request asking for either used or new fighter jets, and its air force has identified a few dozen pilots who speak English and are prepared to begin training immediately, she said.  \n>  \n>But modern tanks and jets may be little more than a pipe dream, at least for now.

In BVR youre essentially pitting your physics against theirs. An AAMRAM has a fixed amount of energy stored in the missile (its fuel). You can augment that by flying faster, your speed is added to its when it drops off the rail. Or you can fly higher, thinner air = more energy for speed = a bigger MAR. Conversely a defending fighter always has options. They can dive down, moving from thinner air high altitudes to thicker lower altitudes. They can fly perpendicular to a missile to force it to turn heavily. Or they can go cold and extend range. Each option wastes missile energy, increases the possibility that the missile loses sight of you, and generally gives the flyer a chance to escape.

The mission was a ground attack on a refinery, the flight was briefed that the target zone had been clear. As they flew into the target area, the flight flew right over an SA-2 battery that flipped on basically at point blank range. You can tell this is an air to ground engagement because, if you look, the aircraft (think it\u2019s an F-16?) is in CCIP mode the whole time. That\u2019s an air to ground mode for free fall bombs. Not A2A. The pilot here pulls off some extremely good maneuvering and evaded 5 or 6 SA-2s. Another member of the flight was not so lucky and was either damaged or shot down. You can hear the call out, can\u2019t remember myself what the outcome was. I believe the battery further succeeded in forcing the mission to abort.\n\nSo basically you have a situation where the defender was able to get the drop on the attacker and maximize heir advantage. Nevertheless SAMs work on a fundamentally different principle than an AAMRAM, as they are ground launched. Their bigger, so more energy, but also have to punch through lots more air. The camera records the fighter was ~26k ft and 350 knots when the engagement began. That\u2019s tough for an SA-2, which was also notoriously unmanuverable.  Most SAM evasion techniques were pioneered in Vietnam, and carried into Desert Storm, and we\u2019re specifically designed to counter the SA-2. Had that been a battery of SA-6s say, that flight would probably not have survived. \n\nAs for stealth, stealth is nice but not a panacea. Like I said the issue with stealth isn\u2019t stealth vs. no stealth, it\u2019s stealth vs. stealth. One has to assume that a peer adversary is going to have a similar capability to your own. A flying wing might beat a J-11, but then so will an F-22 or a modernized F-15. But against a J-20 who knows. Undeniably the F-22s advantage will be significantly reduced. A flying wing might be better but then what\u2019s to stop China from flying it\u2019s own flying wing super stealth fighter? \n\nIMO the real solution is UAVs with powerful radars and data link to change the dynamics of the BVR fight and maintain a rather more generalized stealth based around EM discipline.

Think of that situation as a throw back to the Vietnam era, rather than something looking forward. Those kind of SAM beats are rather uncommon. A SAM will be totally invisible to a fighter until it flips on its radar, and so it can get you over a barrel as happened in the linked video. An S-300 also has an IR mode, which has a shorter range than their radar guidance BUT will not trigger an RWR warning. So the only indication that an S-300 is firing an IR missile at you is either the white plume of the launch or the fire when your fighter gets hit. \n\nIn terms of BVR A2A fights this is different. Current gen missiles need a radar lock from the launching platform to do the initial track, especially if you\u2019re shooting at extreme range (which for an AAMRAM might be out to 50mi or more, depending on conditions). So to get a radar lock, you need to turn on your radar. But if you do that, my RWR will pick up your radar broadcast. So your bearing and range are roughly known. The question becomes can you launch before I get a lock through your stealth. If you do launch first that doesn\u2019t ensure a kill, unless I\u2019m within MAR. If im within MAR, there is *nothing* i can do to survive. If im outside MAR, defensive maneuvers and specifically going cold (flying straight away from the launch) will *probably* save me. So in the ideal you want a fighter that can remain stealthy until you get me within MAR. BUT! The MAR is pretty tight. It may be as low as 10mi on the deck for an AAMRAM, which is very close even by stealth standards (maybe, who knows what the real deal on the F-22 is). \n\nSo let\u2019s consider the problem, I know you\u2019re out there, I\u2019ll know when you fire, I\u2019ll have to assume I\u2019m close to MAR and then defend aggressively. And you may have to get close enough to ensure a kill then I penetrate your stealth and return fire. If You\u2019re stealth and im not, you have a HUGE advantage. If you and I are both stealth tho, things begin to even out. We both have to get in close to detect each other. Taking it another step further, our MARs will be smaller because the missiles will not track as well. Your flying wing might be better than against my F-22 but as I said I dispute the idea that this is a bridge too far for China. \n\nInstead AI/Unmanned offers a dynamic changing capability. Like I said, the biggest limitation with current systems is that my F-22 still has to radiate to lock and launch on your wing. But imagine if I got an F-23 that has a second seat weapons officer who controls the data link drone. The drone flies ahead with a powerful radar and tries to pick up your wing. Maybe I have 2 or 3 of them. You flip on your radar, hoping you found a -22. But my drones swarm and get your stealth on their radars (because my drones will run down your radar emission). Data link sends your location to my missiles, and then my AIM-220 is launched, without any emission from the F-23, based on that data link. You have to go defensive while I have no risk out against me. Thus I have an absolute advantage over you. The hope is that this is such a leap that the USAF can manage it while the PLAF cannot, whereas stealth is already an understood technology.",

High losses in Ukraine and war weariness might change this.</p>\n\n<p>It remains to be seen how much heavy equipment there is available. Personally, I expect to see no shortage of tanks, armoured vehicles and artillery - at least for these 300k. After all, they wouldn&#39;t be summoning tank crews as one of the priority specialisations if they didn&#39;t need them to crew vehicles.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I have to apologise to all those asking questions for not receiving any answers. The automod removes my comments and (understandably) it takes sometime for mods to approve them or not. Anyway, I posted replies to all of you and can only apologise if you are unable to see them.</p>\n</div>",
