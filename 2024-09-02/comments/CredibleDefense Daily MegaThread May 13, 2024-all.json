The fact he was moved from Minister of defence to Secretary of the Security Council sounded like moving people around to look like there was some change. But if some of his cronies are being kicked out suggests that he may be receiving some form of censure. There is also the fact that the man he is replacing Nikolai Patrushev has not received a replacement cabinet position which speaks volumes. Both of them were major proponents of the  invasion of Ukraine. The removal and moving around of such people may point to Putin either looking to move towards ending the war or at least setting up scapegoats if it goes wrong. Just my 2 pence.",

The weapon could be launched from AC-130J Ghostrider gunships and MC-130J Commando II special operations tanker/transport aircraft, and potentially other platforms. New stand-off strike capabilities like this are seen as key to ensuring the relevance of aircraft like the AC-130J and MC-130J in future high-end conflicts, such as a potential one in the Pacific against China.*\n\n*A picture, seen at the top of this story, showing what SOCOM is simply calling the Small Cruise Missile being test launched was included in briefings at the annual SOF Week conference, which kicked off on Monday. That test was conducted sometime in the last six months, U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Jason Lee, head of SOCOM's Detachment 1 at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, told The War Zone and other attendees at SOF Week earlier today.*\n\n*\"We're continuing forward on that,\" Lee said about progress on the Small Cruise Missile effort.*\n\n*The picture from the Small Cruise Missile Test is very low quality and it is difficult to make any significant details about the design. It does appear to have an x-shaped tail fin arrangement and apertures on its body. From what can be seen, there do appear to be some broad similarities between this weapon and the ADM-160 Miniature Air-Launched Decoy (MALD). The former could potentially be related in some way to the latter, but at this time, we don't know.*\n\n*It is also seen being launched rearward from a square-edged container strapped to the rear cargo ramp of a C-130-type aircraft. Otherwise, details about the Small Cruise Missile design remain limited.*\n\n*In 2021, SOCOM did issue a contracting notice regarding a Stand-Off Precision Guided Weapon Program Cruise Missile outlining interest in a weapon of this type with a range of between 200 and 400 nautical miles (around 230 and 460 miles or nearly 370.5 and almost 741 kilometers) that could fit inside a standardized cylindrical Common Launch Tube (CLT). CLTs are in widespread use within the U.S. special operations community, as well as the rest of the U.S. military, as a means for launching various munitions and other payloads from different crewed and uncrewed fixed-wing aircraft, as well as helicopters. The CLT can accommodate payloads up to 42 inches in length and 5.95 inches in diameter, and has a 100-pound weight limit, according to a separate SOCOM contracting notice issued around the same time. It is unclear how feasible it would be to design something that meets these requirements with a 200-nautical-mile range, let alone the ability to hit targets out to 400 nautical miles.*\n\n*The Stand-Off Precision Guided Weapon Program Cruise Missile notice also called for the system to \"include, at threshold, an EO/IR [electro-optical/infrared] seeker and as an objective incorporate a multi-mode seeker package able to acquire and/or reacquire targets in flight.\" Furthermore, the weapon \"at threshold... shall have a removable payload section that can accept 13lbs of warhead or other desired payload (objective of 37 lbs), compatibility with an X-Net radio, electric propulsion, and an INS/GPS (M-Code) capability.\"*\n\n*Other \"key attributes include the long range, data link connection to Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL) (threshold) and SADL/Link-16 (objective), resilient GPS/INS to work in a denied GPS environment, a sensor capable of identifying targets once over the target area, and a payload to effect the target,\" the notice added.*\n\n*As described in the contracting notice three years ago, this small cruise missile would offer U.S. special operations aircraft, including AC-130Js and MC-130Js, a highly flexible stand-off strike capability against static and moving targets. The missile would also greatly outrange the existing weapons in what SOCOM calls its Stand-Off Precision-Guided Munitions (SOPGM) arsenal, at least that we know of.*\n\n*The SOPGM munition with the longest reach now is the GBU-39B/B Laser Small Diameter Bomb (LSDB), which cannot fit inside a CLT, has a stated maximum range of at least 40 nautical miles (around 46 miles or 74 kilometers). The stated range of the GBU-69/B Small Glide Munition, the weapon in the SOPGM portfolio with the longest reach that can also go inside a CLT, is at least 20 nautical miles (nearly 23 miles or around 37 kilometers).*\n\n*Whatever the Small Cruise Missile's expected capabilities might be, the weapon is key to SOCOM's future fixed-wing aviation plans.*\n\n[[Video] AC-130J Ghostrider gunship gunnery in South Korea | Exercise Teak Knife 2023 | Korea Defense Blog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DDcIyfSwnA)\n\nIn a conflict with China could the U.S. create an environment where AC-130s would be safe to engage the Chinese Islands in the South China Sea?",

They're willing to sacrifice immeasurable resources in order to continue their assault on Ukraine. \n\n2) Ukraine does not have any offensive capacity. To them right now, a \"win\" is considered holding the line and not losing additional land. Going forward, they can only a) not lose land or b) lose land. They will not gain land.\n\nSo going forward, Ukraine can only lose or lose more. It's a position where you fast-forward the clock and eventually the war ends in some sort of negotiated settlement with Russia or a total capitulation.\n\nSo, how does the West prevent this? Well, they could send military aid and they have been. But is that enough? Ukraine's problems are deep seated. They don't have the manpower to properly defend the frontline.\n\nYou can send all the aid in the world and that doesn't guarantee a successful Ukrainian defense, let alone an offensive advance. We've been sending aid for two years and they are slowly but surely losing ground.\n\nSo, what's the only real solution left to prevent Ukraine from losing and/or allow Ukraine to win? Military intervention. \n\nThe reason I believe it will likely lead to full blown war is because the scale of the intervention necessary to reverse Ukraine's position will have to be a large one. A thousand troops training Ukrainians in the West and a handful of covert special ops will not be enough.\n\nA full blown military intervention is necessary, and that means we have to consider what are the West's intentions?\n\nIf they fully intend to do whatever is in their power so that Russia loses, war is inevitable. If they are just doing the bare minimum, war is not inevitable. I think the fact that they are willing to send troops in the first place means they are committed to do everything in their power so that Russia loses. This implies war. \n\nAnd you say Americans will not be involved, but that's short-sighted. Any real military intervention will have to be coordinated and led by the Americans. At first the smaller countries will join, but if it escalates there will be US planes in the sky and US troops on the ground. I believe it will look something like Vietnam. First observers, trainers, etc show up and then the troops afterwards.\n\nSo that's what I mean by my comment\n\nEither we commit to defending Ukraine and there's a full-blown war, or Ukraine loses. Any other potential scenario is quickly losing plausibility. As the timeline goes on, the branches of possibilities fall off the tree.",

A thousand troops training Ukrainians in the West and a handful of covert special ops will not be enough.</p>\n\n<p>A full blown military intervention is necessary, and that means we have to consider what are the West&#39;s intentions?</p>\n\n<p>If they fully intend to do whatever is in their power so that Russia loses, war is inevitable. If they are just doing the bare minimum, war is not inevitable. I think the fact that they are willing to send troops in the first place means they are committed to do everything in their power so that Russia loses. This implies war. </p>\n\n<p>And you say Americans will not be involved, but that&#39;s short-sighted. Any real military intervention will have to be coordinated and led by the Americans. At first the smaller countries will join, but if it escalates there will be US planes in the sky and US troops on the ground. I believe it will look something like Vietnam. First observers, trainers, etc show up and then the troops afterwards.</p>\n\n<p>So that&#39;s what I mean by my comment</p>\n\n<p>Either we commit to defending Ukraine and there&#39;s a full-blown war, or Ukraine loses. Any other potential scenario is quickly losing plausibility. As the timeline goes on, the branches of possibilities fall off the tree.</p>\n</div>",

It's a bit confusing because it took me a while to realize that there's a difference between conscript and mobilized, at least as many people (including the Russians themselves I believe), use those terms.  \n\nConscript are generally younger men (late teens and early 20s) who are drafted for mandatory military training for, I believe, 2 years.  They've never been in the military before and require a good portion of their time in service just learning basics and often are used for low level administrative and logistical work inside Russia and guarding borders with Ukraine.  They are prohibited by law from being used outside Russia's borders.  Although the annexations technically could allow them to be used in Ukraine, they have not been.  Putin seems to fear that their use in Ukraine could cause loss of public support for and mass opposition to the war, which is perhaps what happened in Afghanistan and Chechnya when conscripts were used there.  \n\nMobilized are generally older men (late 20s, 30s, early 40s) who are reservists.  They've generally already done their mandatory time in the military, sometimes many, many years ago, were discharged, and are now recalled.  After Russian retreat in 2022, Russia did a \"partial\" mobilization of perhaps 300,000 men.  These guys have been thrown into the fight, supposedly after a little retraining.  If anything, I think they have been used to a greater degree in combat than contract soldiers, especially early on as Russia was so undermanned in the combat positions.  I don't think Russia has done any significant mobilization since late 2022, and nothing publicly.  I'm not sure if there a time limit on how long these guys are required to serve.  I suspect Russia burned through a lot of the mobilized guys in 2022 and 2023, and the survivors managed to get non-combat positions. \n\nAt this point, I believe the vast majority of Russians fighting and suffering casualties in Ukraine are contract soldiers, with some mobilized still serving and taking casualties, and essentially zero conscripts fighting and dying in Ukraine.",

It works for things like HIMARS, or an SPG that shoots a couple of long-range guided shells and goes home. But standard unguided tube artillery won't do much with just a few shells per day and does not have as much range.

Technology has made the battlefield very transparent, but piercing through meters of ground and concrete is still not that easy/cheap. And against small drones even a wire mesh gives some protection.

Thermal effects are a lot easier to deal with than the induced currents in the electronics are. \n\n\nRe: sharp corners in a drone, I haven't done this in a while, but I don't think that's actually a significant concern due to the size of a drone. An easy way to see this is in an everyday microwave - as anyone who tried knows even a spoon will have negligible heating, despite their curvature being far harsher than what it would take for a drone.\n\n\nThe phenomenon where sharp corners heat up IIRC is principally due to the constant electric potential on the surface of a conductor : as a result, the electric field has to be perpendicular at the surface, which when the angle is thin, has to lead to a high gradient, and since the total charge is fixed, a high charge density.

An easy way to see this is in an everyday microwave - as anyone who tried knows even a spoon will have negligible heating, despite their curvature being far harsher than what it would take for a drone.</p>\n\n<p>The phenomenon where sharp corners heat up IIRC is principally due to the constant electric potential on the surface of a conductor : as a result, the electric field has to be perpendicular at the surface, which when the angle is thin, has to lead to a high gradient, and since the total charge is fixed, a high charge density.
