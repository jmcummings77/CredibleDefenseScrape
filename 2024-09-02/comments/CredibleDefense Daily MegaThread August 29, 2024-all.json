        "body": "An update on the tactical evolution of the front in Ukraine during the current month. Today we will analyze the sectors from Kursk to Siversk; tomorrow (hopefully!) from Chasiv Yar to Kherson. \n\nKursk sector. Let\u2019s make a very brief recap of the tactical situation, according to my understanding, in an anti-clockwise direction. The Russians have regained control over Spalnoe; but rumors about their seizure of Borki are not true: there is Ukrainian presence inside this settlement.\n\nhttps://t. me/creamy_caprice/6574\n\n Ulanok should be entirely in Russian hands. The current status of Cherkasskaya Konopelka is unclear. Russkaya Konopelka is considered a grey area, but I personally rule out that Ukrainians have been able to consolidate there. The built-up area of Martynovka should be in Ukrainian hands. There appears to have been a recent Ukrainian advance north of the village.\n\nhttps://t. me/creamy_caprice/6578\n\n Cherkasskoe Porechnoe and Russkoe Porechnoe: Ukrainian control. Slightly further north-east, the situation is not so clear. The Russians this week claimed to have regained control over Nechaev (over which, however, there has never been any evidence that it was taken by the Ukrainians); recently, however, Ukrainians have been geolocated in nearby Nizhnyaya Parovaya.\n\nhttps://t. me/creamy_caprice/6584\n\nMost of Malaya Loknya is under Ukrainian control; there remains a Russian presence in women's Penal Colony No. 11, for which there were and are many harsh clashes. Ukrainians are working to surround Russian positions. Pogrebki should be in Russian hands. A little further north-west, the Ukrainians should control the strip of land along the ravines up to Semenovka, which the Russians are trying to eliminate. Kremyanoe should be controlled by the Russians; the Ukrainians have been unsuccessful in entering here, despite several attempts in recent days too. \n\nhttps://t. me/motopatriot/26927\n\nOlgovka should be contested. There is definitely Ukrainian presence in this latter village, which the Russians are nevertheless trying to retake. \n\nhttps://t. me/creamy_caprice/6514\n\nThe Russians have regained control over Vetreno. The situation further north, where last week Ukrainians had approached the Koronevo-Lgov railway near the station located at Km 367, is unclear.\n\nRussian resistance in Koronevo has been strong from the beginning; there is a Russian presence even in the part of the town located on the eastern bank of the Krepna River, which the Ukrainians have been trying to occupy.\n\nhttps://t. me/creamy_caprice/6588\n\nDeepState today reported that this part has switched from being controlled by the Ukrainians to a grey area, although there has never been any evidence, that I know of, that the Ukrainians had occupied it in first place. Krasnooktyabrskoe was occupied by the Ukrainians, who also captured the area around the railway station located at Km 344. In this direction the Ukrainians managed to reach the Komarovka-Novoivanovka line. Further south, the Synyak Reservoir should be fully in Russian hands.\n\nThere is Russian presence in the southern bank of the Seym River, despite the logistical difficulties given by the Ukrainian destruction of the three bridges. Supplies arrive via the pontoon bridges, which are regularly attacked by the Ukrainians. We shall see how the Russian bridgehead will be able to hold out, which will obviously depend on the intensity of Ukrainian attacks against it and on Ukrainian control over the Krasnooktyabrskoe area. On the opposite side, west of Tetkino, the Ukrainians have occupied the area between the state border and the Seym.\n\nNow, let\u2019s analyze the order of battle. First, the operation is carried out by a grouping of the Air Assault Forces. For instance, the 2nd Air Assault Battalion of the 80th Air Assault Brigade and the 3rd Air Assault Battalion of the 82nd Air Assault Brigade. There are also support units of these brigades. Additional battalions of these brigades are being brought into action (it may happen that a battalion of a brigade arrives in a sector and is later joined by the rest of the brigade). It is logical after all to expect that the bulk of the resources of these brigades will be concentrated for the operations in Kursk Oblast. In fact, I have also identified the 1st Battalion of the 80th Brigade and the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 82nd Brigade as being committed in Kursk. \n\nAs far as I could find, there is at least a company tactical group of the 78th Air Assault Regiment (other elements should be active in Toretsk) \u2013 possibly the rest of the regiment may be going to arrive. Elements of the 95th Air Assault Brigade have been brought into action, in the Malaya Loknya area. I identified the presence of at least its 1st and 13th Air Assault Battalions. Most of the brigade moved from the Toretsk sector to the Kursk sector during this month. The 501st Battalion of the 36th Marine Brigade, transferred from Vovchansk, has been deployed in the western part of the Kursk sector.\n\nAs for the rest, there is the 225th Separate Assault Battalion (previously in Chasiv Yar), the 33rd Separate Assault Battalion and the 253rd Assault Battalion (both of them previously in Vovchansk \u2013 the latter should actually be still part of the 129th TDF Brigade). In the past year Ukraine has created assault battalions by reforming territorial defense battalions, almost always taking that battalion out of organic subordination to the TDF brigade. The 252nd Battalion, the one that had raided Poroz (Belgorod Oblast), might also have become a separate assault unit and no longer subordinate to the 241st TDF Brigade. \n\nElements of the 103rd, 106th, 117th, 119th and 129th TDF Brigades are active in the Kursk sector. In particular, the bulk of the 103rd Brigade should be here, and perhaps there could be elements of the 110th TDF Brigade as well. \n\nThen there are the 22nd and 61st Mechanized Brigades, which should have been brought into action almost in full, with the 11th Rifle Battalion subordinate to the 22nd and the 20th Rifle Battalion to the 61st. There is no evidence of involvement of units of the 116th Mech Brigade outside its UAV unit - \"Khorne Group\u201d. Elements of the 92nd Assault Brigade (with its BTR-4s) have been involved in actions in the direction of Giri. So far I have found indications of its 3rd Assault Battalion, in addition to the \"Achilles\" Strike UAV Battalion. Rybar [claimed](https://x.com/rybar_force/status/1829197025205735561) that the Ukrainians will bring this brigade here in full (from Lyptsi), although from some indications I have found, elements of this brigade may have been transferred to the Pokrovsk sector.\n\nThe 49th Assault Engineer Brigade, a newly created type of brigade, is participating in hostilities too, according to this unit\u2019s official sources. Then there are detachments of the 8th SOF Regiment and the of \"Alpha Group\u201d of the SBU. So far there is no evidence of involvement of units of the HUR, which actually appears to be very marginally involved in the operation (then we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on behind the scenes). \n\nRussian channels claim they captured Ukrainian POWs from the 41st and 154th Mech Brigades, but I have no evidence to confirm the presence of such units in the sector.\n\nThen there is the question of the 88th Mech Brigade, the most mysterious in the UAF - which may even have Bradleys, according to a past publication by brigade's sources. No, there isn't any evidence that it is involved in hostilities. I had found indication on social media that elements of it might be in the Pokrovsk sector, but there was never any confirmation to this. However, from a photo posted on their Telegram channel, they are most likely in Kharkiv Oblast, where the brigade's Mobile Fire Group and its artillery group had been allegedly deployed for the past few months. No idea where the brigade's maneuver units are located.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>An update on the tactical evolution of the front in Ukraine during the current month. Today we will analyze the sectors from Kursk to Siversk; tomorrow (hopefully!) from Chasiv Yar to Kherson. </p>\n\n<p>Kursk sector. Let\u2019s make a very brief recap of the tactical situation, according to my understanding, in an anti-clockwise direction. The Russians have regained control over Spalnoe; but rumors about their seizure of Borki are not true: there is Ukrainian presence inside this settlement.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a>. me/creamy_caprice/6574</p>\n\n<p>Ulanok should be entirely in Russian hands. The current status of Cherkasskaya Konopelka is unclear. Russkaya Konopelka is considered a grey area, but I personally rule out that Ukrainians have been able to consolidate there. The built-up area of Martynovka should be in Ukrainian hands. There appears to have been a recent Ukrainian advance north of the village.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a>. me/creamy_caprice/6578</p>\n\n<p>Cherkasskoe Porechnoe and Russkoe Porechnoe: Ukrainian control. Slightly further north-east, the situation is not so clear. The Russians this week claimed to have regained control over Nechaev (over which, however, there has never been any evidence that it was taken by the Ukrainians); recently, however, Ukrainians have been geolocated in nearby Nizhnyaya Parovaya.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a>. me/creamy_caprice/6584</p>\n\n<p>Most of Malaya Loknya is under Ukrainian control; there remains a Russian presence in women&#39;s Penal Colony No. 11, for which there were and are many harsh clashes. Ukrainians are working to surround Russian positions. Pogrebki should be in Russian hands. A little further north-west, the Ukrainians should control the strip of land along the ravines up to Semenovka, which the Russians are trying to eliminate. Kremyanoe should be controlled by the Russians; the Ukrainians have been unsuccessful in entering here, despite several attempts in recent days too. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a>. me/motopatriot/26927</p>\n\n<p>Olgovka should be contested. There is definitely Ukrainian presence in this latter village, which the Russians are nevertheless trying to retake. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a>. me/creamy_caprice/6514</p>\n\n<p>The Russians have regained control over Vetreno. The situation further north, where last week Ukrainians had approached the Koronevo-Lgov railway near the station located at Km 367, is unclear.</p>\n\n<p>Russian resistance in Koronevo has been strong from the beginning; there is a Russian presence even in the part of the town located on the eastern bank of the Krepna River, which the Ukrainians have been trying to occupy.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a>. me/creamy_caprice/6588</p>\n\n<p>DeepState today reported that this part has switched from being controlled by the Ukrainians to a grey area, although there has never been any evidence, that I know of, that the Ukrainians had occupied it in first place. Krasnooktyabrskoe was occupied by the Ukrainians, who also captured the area around the railway station located at Km 344. In this direction the Ukrainians managed to reach the Komarovka-Novoivanovka line. Further south, the Synyak Reservoir should be fully in Russian hands.</p>\n\n<p>There is Russian presence in the southern bank of the Seym River, despite the logistical difficulties given by the Ukrainian destruction of the three bridges. Supplies arrive via the pontoon bridges, which are regularly attacked by the Ukrainians. We shall see how the Russian bridgehead will be able to hold out, which will obviously depend on the intensity of Ukrainian attacks against it and on Ukrainian control over the Krasnooktyabrskoe area. On the opposite side, west of Tetkino, the Ukrainians have occupied the area between the state border and the Seym.</p>\n\n<p>Now, let\u2019s analyze the order of battle. First, the operation is carried out by a grouping of the Air Assault Forces. For instance, the 2nd Air Assault Battalion of the 80th Air Assault Brigade and the 3rd Air Assault Battalion of the 82nd Air Assault Brigade. There are also support units of these brigades. Additional battalions of these brigades are being brought into action (it may happen that a battalion of a brigade arrives in a sector and is later joined by the rest of the brigade). It is logical after all to expect that the bulk of the resources of these brigades will be concentrated for the operations in Kursk Oblast. In fact, I have also identified the 1st Battalion of the 80th Brigade and the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 82nd Brigade as being committed in Kursk. </p>\n\n<p>As far as I could find, there is at least a company tactical group of the 78th Air Assault Regiment (other elements should be active in Toretsk) \u2013 possibly the rest of the regiment may be going to arrive. Elements of the 95th Air Assault Brigade have been brought into action, in the Malaya Loknya area. I identified the presence of at least its 1st and 13th Air Assault Battalions. Most of the brigade moved from the Toretsk sector to the Kursk sector during this month. The 501st Battalion of the 36th Marine Brigade, transferred from Vovchansk, has been deployed in the western part of the Kursk sector.</p>\n\n<p>As for the rest, there is the 225th Separate Assault Battalion (previously in Chasiv Yar), the 33rd Separate Assault Battalion and the 253rd Assault Battalion (both of them previously in Vovchansk \u2013 the latter should actually be still part of the 129th TDF Brigade). In the past year Ukraine has created assault battalions by reforming territorial defense battalions, almost always taking that battalion out of organic subordination to the TDF brigade. The 252nd Battalion, the one that had raided Poroz (Belgorod Oblast), might also have become a separate assault unit and no longer subordinate to the 241st TDF Brigade. </p>\n\n<p>Elements of the 103rd, 106th, 117th, 119th and 129th TDF Brigades are active in the Kursk sector. In particular, the bulk of the 103rd Brigade should be here, and perhaps there could be elements of the 110th TDF Brigade as well. </p>\n\n<p>Then there are the 22nd and 61st Mechanized Brigades, which should have been brought into action almost in full, with the 11th Rifle Battalion subordinate to the 22nd and the 20th Rifle Battalion to the 61st. There is no evidence of involvement of units of the 116th Mech Brigade outside its UAV unit - &quot;Khorne Group\u201d. Elements of the 92nd Assault Brigade (with its BTR-4s) have been involved in actions in the direction of Giri. So far I have found indications of its 3rd Assault Battalion, in addition to the &quot;Achilles&quot; Strike UAV Battalion. Rybar <a href=\"https://x.com/rybar_force/status/1829197025205735561\">claimed</a> that the Ukrainians will bring this brigade here in full (from Lyptsi), although from some indications I have found, elements of this brigade may have been transferred to the Pokrovsk sector.</p>\n\n<p>The 49th Assault Engineer Brigade, a newly created type of brigade, is participating in hostilities too, according to this unit\u2019s official sources. Then there are detachments of the 8th SOF Regiment and the of &quot;Alpha Group\u201d of the SBU. So far there is no evidence of involvement of units of the HUR, which actually appears to be very marginally involved in the operation (then we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on behind the scenes). </p>\n\n<p>Russian channels claim they captured Ukrainian POWs from the 41st and 154th Mech Brigades, but I have no evidence to confirm the presence of such units in the sector.</p>\n\n<p>Then there is the question of the 88th Mech Brigade, the most mysterious in the UAF - which may even have Bradleys, according to a past publication by brigade&#39;s sources.

            "body": "The 810th Naval Infantry Brigade has been fully deployed in the sector. It mainly defends the north-eastern part of it. Elements of this brigade were already in the Kursk Oblast, the rest came from the Kherson sector. \n\nThe 155th Naval Infantry Brigade, previously active in Hlyboke, has also been moved to Kursk. Specifically, some elements cover areas of the state border while others are in the bridgehead south of the Seym River.\n\nThere were rumors from Russian sources that both of these brigades, before the start of the operation, were to move to the Pokrovsk sector - this was of course canceled. \n\nThe 56th Air Assault Regiment of the 7th VDV Division has been transferred from the Orikhiv sector to the Kursk sector, confirming reports from Russian sources from two weeks ago that elements of the 7th VDV Division were being transferred to Kursk. \n\nhttps://t. me/vdv_za_chestnost_spravedlivost/3747\n\nhttps://t. me/vdv_za_chestnost_spravedlivost/3921\n\nAccording to Kriegsforscher, famous UAV operator of the 36th Marine Brigade, a battalion of the 217th Airborne Regiment (98th VDV Division) and of the 104th Air Assault Regiment (76th VDV Division) were already in the area to cover the border, but they should not have been brought into action directly. He also stated that at least elements of the 108th Air Assault Regiment of the 7th Division are on their way from the Orikhiv sector and potentially the rest of the 217th Airborne Regiment of the 98th VDV Division (in this case from Chasiv Yar) is on its way too. In the future, the arrival of elements of the 76th and 104th VDV Divisions from the Kherson sector cannot be ruled out, according to the Russian source I posted above. According to the same source, and later confirmed by Kriegsforscher, the 136th Motorized Brigade of the 58th CAA will be transferred from the Orikhiv sector to the Kursk sector (it is unclear whether in order to cover the border or to be directly involved in the fighting); just like elements of the 116th Special Purpose Brigade of the Rosgvardia, from Vovchansk. \n\nAccording to a MIA notice I found, there is a missing serviceman of the 1060th Material Supply Battalion of the 106th VDV Division; these days we learned that the 51st Airborne Regiment of this division is deployed in the sector (transferred from the Siversk sector). Evidently, the initial rumors about the arrival of elements of the 106th VDV Division were true.\n\nhttps://t. me/vdv_nkn/30953\n\nAt least one battalion of the 83rd VDV Brigade may have arrived from Vovchansk, according to Ukrainian sources; in addition to the 11th VDV Brigade, previously active in the Chasiv Yar sector. The latter, which presence is confirmed by Russian sources, is defending the south-eastern part of the Kursk sector. \n\nThe 45th Spetsnaz VDV Brigade is supposed to be in the sector (its recon battalion was already in the Kharkiv sector, the rest probably arrived from the Kamyanske sector), but there\u2019s no evidence that it has been brought into action directly. There is, however, involvement of the 2nd Spetsnaz GRU Brigade, transferred from Vovchansk, and possibly of a detachment of the 10th Spetsnaz GRU Brigade (which arrived from Kherson), according to MIA notices. Then there is the motorized regiment of the Aerospace Forces, recently formed, and active in Koronevo.\n\nThe Ukrainian observer Mashovets had reported that Lapin, head of both the Group of Forces \"North\" and of the Leningrad Military District, has requested (to the Joint Group of Forces) that the 14th Corps, which belongs to the Leningrad MD - formerly under the subordination of the Northern (Arctic) Fleet, but not to the GoF \"North\u201d, should be sent to the Kursk sector as reinforcements: its 200th Motorized Brigade has so far fought in the northern flank of Chasiv Yar (as part of the GoF \"South\"), while its 80th Motorized Brigade performs duties near the mouth of the Dnipro in the Kherson sector (as part of the GoF \"Dnepr\"). The 200th Brigade has already gone into action in Kursk (in the north-western part of the sector), while the 80th Brigade has not yet, as far as we know. \n\nNews had also come out that conscripts of the 80th Motorized Brigade will be transferred to Kursk Oblast; just like conscripts of the 217th Airborne Regiment of the 98th VDV Division.\n\nhttps://t. me/agentstvonews/6957\n\nhttps://t. me/necro_tv/103385\n\nIt is unclear whether conscripts will be taken into battle or will be used to cover second/third lines behind the current Ukrainian forward positions and/or quieter areas of the state border. \n\nAt the beginning of offensive operations there were two battalions of conscripts from the 488th Motorized Regiment (144th Motorized Division, 20th CAA), along with a battalion of conscripts from the 254th and 283rd Motorized Regiments of the same division, as well as a battalion of conscripts from the 252nd Motorized Regiment of the 3rd Motorized Division (20th CAA). There is no evidence to say that \"professional\" units of the 144th Motorized Division are being moved to Kursk from the Lyman sector. Other battalions of conscripts from several other brigades/regiments of various CAAs were/are covering the border in Kursk Oblast, but independently of the rest of their brigade/regiment. \n\nThe 22nd Motorized Regiment of the 72nd Motorized Division of the 44th Corps - the only regiment of this division that had not been brought into the battle \u2013 has been committed in Kursk. Per Russian sources, soldiers from this regiment were those who fell victim to the attack with GMLRS in Rylsk (34 KIAs and 70 WIAs are admitted).\n\nhttps://t. me/severnnyi/1702\n\n The 30th Motorized Regiment of the same division was also transferred to Kursk. A serviceman of this unit stated that the regiment lost \"half its members\" in Vovchansk (probably an exaggeration, but still), besides from complaining that he receives 34 thousand Rubles per month (instead of 204) as he is not formally in the \u201cSMO\u201d zone.\n\nhttps://t. me/ne_zhdi_novosti/721\n\nSeveral battalions of the 11th Corps (consisting of the 18th Motorized Division and of the 7th Separate Motorized Regiment) have also arrived in Kursk from the Kharkiv sector; at least one battalion of the 82nd Motorized Regiment of the 69th Motorized Division of the 6th CAA is also arriving in Kursk - the first elements of the newly created 83rd Motorized Regiment of the same division are also arriving too. Elements of the 272nd Motorized Regiment of the 47th Tank Division (1st GTA) have arrived from the Kupyansk sector. Several regiments of the Territorial Forces also arrived, primarily those subordinate to the 6th CAA and to the 11th Corps, such as the 345th, 361st, 1009th and 1427th Regiments. \n\nIn addition, a battalion each of the 38th and 64th Motorized Brigades of the 35th CAA should also have been transferred from Polohy, according to Ukrainian sources. In the Grayvoron area should be the bulk of the 245th Motorized Regiment of the 47th Tank Division, to which elements of the 11th Tank Brigade of the 25th CAA are attached. \n\nLet\u2019s also recall units such as the \"Pyatnashka\" Battalion, the \"ArBat\" Battalion; \"Veterans\" and \"Hispaniola\" Assault and Recon Brigades of the Cossack Volunteer Assault Corps. As well as the Akhmat units: if initially there were the Kadyrovites of the \"Akhmat-Zapad\" Battalion, and of the 349th (\"Akhmat-Russia\") and 1434th (\"Akhmat-Chechnya\") Regiments of the Territorial Forces, then came detachments of the \"Akhmat Special Forces\" (these composed mostly of ethnic Russians) such as the 204th \"Aida\" Regiment and the \"1st Assault Detachment\", which is Ratibor\u2019s unit, manned by former Wagnerites. There are also elements of the \"Issa Pliev\" Regiment, which encompasses several Ossetian detachments.\n\nIn any case, as we see, the arrival of Russian reinforcements has been very large, in spite of some narrative. And that has also quite slowed down offensive operations in the front\u2019s secondary sectors, although at the same time the Russians have more or less managed to stabilize the situation in Kursk.

                "body": "Kharkiv sector. Despite the transfer of resources to Kursk Oblast, the Russians have recently carried out several attacks in the direction of Lyptsi, probably to prevent the Ukrainians from moving forces from this sector to Kursk. Units of the 11th Corps, reinforced by regiments of the Territorial Forces such as the 345th and 1431st, are active in the area. \n\nThe Russians were able to regain control over Hlyboke and once again to reach the beginning of the area of the dachas to the east of the Travianske Reservoir. This area is mainly defended by the 13th \"Khartiia\" Brigade of the National Guard. There was also a minor advance south-east of Lukyantsi.\n\nhttps://t. me/creamy_caprice/6381\n\nThere was a very slight Russian progress in Starytsia. \n\nhttps://t. me/creamy_caprice/6523\n\nLittle changes in Vovchansk. The town, or rather what remains of it, is no longer in the spotlight. Overall, the area controlled by either side has not changed in any noteworthy way. There remains a Russian presence in the Vovchansk Aggregate Plant, thanks to their occasional control over Pushkinska Street. Last month I recall that some Russian sources put out a rumor that the Russians had crossed the Vovcha River, actually a delusion. No change in the areas outside the town. Both sides removed troops from here to send them to Kursk. \n\nKupyansk sector (ah, the good ol' times when I used to start the updates from here!). The 116th Mech Brigade, the 2nd Mech Battalion of the 30th Mech Brigade, elements of the 44th Mech Brigade, of the 241st TDF Brigade, and of the 143rd Infantry Brigade, along with the 14th Mech Brigade, defend Synkivka and the area east of the settlement, which are attacked by elements of the 25th Motorized Brigade of the 6th CAA along with several regiments of the Territorial Forces, such as the 1486th. The northern half of Synkivka is a grey area, in which there are occasional Russian penetrations. The southern one is likely controlled by Ukrainians, although Russian sources report that Ukrainians entirely abandoned the village. Stable situation in Stepova Novosilka.\n\nhttps://t. me/motopatriot/26935\n\nElements of the 2nd Motorized Division and of the 47th Tank Division of the 1st GTA continue to make progress in the Pischane area, defended primarily by the 110th TDF Brigade, with support from elements of the 104th and of 114th TDF Brigades and of the \"Pomsta\" Brigade of the Border Guards \u2013 elements of the new 154th Mech Brigade were also recently committed in the area.\n\nThe Russians are both advancing in the heights north of Pischane, capturing some Ukrainian strongpoints, and westwards along the course of the Pischana River, a tributary of the Oskil. Russian forward positions are within 6 km of the latter river. The future risk is that the eastern bank of the Oskil north of this area may find itself isolated and become a bridgehead.\n\nBorova sector. The situation has stabilized, despite some Russian advances last month west of Novoselivske - when the Russians (the 27th Motorized Brigade and the 4th Tank Division of the 1st GTA are active here) had captured the source of the Zherebets River.\n\nThe 77th Airmobile Brigade, units of the 44th Mech Brigade and a battalion of the 1st \"Bureviy\" Brigade of the NG are defending the area from Berestove to Andriivka, with quite some success, and the Russians are still unable to consolidate control over the eastern bank of the Zherebets, despite the advance recorded today in Andriivka by DeepState, in the eastern banks of the river.\n\nThe 3rd Assault Brigade, after holding its positions against attacks by units of the 3rd Motorized Division of the 20th CAA, has started counterattacks and has achieved tactical success, with an advance of about 2,5 km west of Novovodyane, clearing the western bank of the Zherebets in that specific area.\n\nUnits of the 3rd and 144th Motorized Divisions of the 20th CAA continue attacks in Makiivka (along with elements of the 245th Motorized Regiment of the 47th Tank Division), against the positions of the 66th Mech Brigade, reinforced by elements of the 115th Mech Brigade and probably by the 4th Mech Battalion of the Separate Presidential Brigade. Most likely there is no longer a Ukrainian presence in the part of the village to the east of the Zherebets. The Russians have also been geolocated in the western part, just past the river. It is not clear they have been able to consolidate there; that said, the river at that point is passable on foot. \n\nhttps://t. me/creamy_caprice/6430\n\nLyman sector. Stable situation, no notable changes. Last month there were slight Russian gains south-west of Dibrova, where units of the 25th CAA are active, but that\u2019s it. I also believe that the 21st Mech Brigade (which has Leopard 2A5/6s and CV90s, among others), which used to fight near Terny, has been moved somewhere in the rear as a reserve over the past months \u2013 possibly to Odesa, where it was raised. It has been a long time since there are no combat videos released by the brigade, nor there are recent MIA notices or obituaries of brigade\u2019s soldiers.\n\nStable situation in the Serebrianka Forest, where the 12th \"Azov\" Brigade of the NG faces units of the 67th Motorized Division of the 25th CAA, reinforced by elements of the 153rd Tank Regiment of the 47th Tank Division.\n\nSiversk sector. Slight Russian [advances](https://x.com/blinzka/status/1825494689706902003) inside Bilohorivka (attacked by the 7th Motorized Brigade of the 3rd CAA - the former 2nd Corps), which remains firmly defended by the 81st Airmobile Brigade. Russians returned to the first streets of the built-up area of the settlement, in its eastern part, but nothing too serious. The Russians also (re)captured the filtration station along the Siversky Donets, earlier this month. The Terrikon of the chalk quarry remains firmly in Ukrainian hands. \n\nhttps://t. me/creamy_caprice/6280\n\nNo Russian advances reported in the defense area of the 54th Mech Brigade, despite being regularly attacked by the 6th Motorized Brigade of the 3rd CAA, which focuses on the company-stronghold to the east of Verkhnokamyanske.\n\nThe situation in Spirne and Ivano-Darivka isn\u2019t entirely clear. The Russians (123rd Motorized Brigade of the 3rd CAA) entered both villages, but were probably unable to consolidate control over there. I think Spirne is mostly a grey area, with Ukrainian [positions](https://x.com/Bielitzling/status/1823140534967284063 ) just west of the settlement. There should be Ukrainian presence at the moment in Ivano-Darivka, but the Russians are moving up the forest belts south of the settlement. The 3rd and 4th Operational Battalions of the 4th \"Rubizh\" Brigade of the NG are active in this area.\n\nhttps://t. me/creamy_caprice/6455\n\nIn the defense area of the 10th Mountain Assault Brigade and of its \"dowries\u201d, the 137th and 119th Airborne Regiments of the 106th VDV Division continue to press and make progress in the direction of Pereizne and Vyimka, respectively. In the former case, the Russians approached the beginning of the village, having completed firstly the capture of Rozdolivka and then of trenches along the Soledar-Siversk railway, and the other strongpoints to the north and north-east of the village. In the second direction, the Russians are attempting to approach the Vyimka railway station, located along the Siversk-Nyrkove railway, south of the settlement.",

Being able to create and officially adopt the latest technologies is great but being able to actually acquire and produce it in large enough quantities is better.  \n\n[A group of 20-somethings built a GPS-independent drone in 24 hours\u2014and caught the eye of US special operations forces | Defense One | August 2024](https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/08/group-20-somethings-built-gps-independent-drone-24-hoursand-caught-eye-us-special-operations-forces/399017/?oref=d1-skybox-hp)\n\n*So over the course of a couple days, with very little sleep, Ian and his two partners figured out a new system to allow drones to locate where they were, without having to rely on a signal beamed down from a constellation of satellites. The trick: have the drone\u2019s cameras take pictures and compare those to a database of Google image maps, using simple machine learning. Within 24 hours, the team had cobbled together a GPS-independent drone for less than $500.*\n\n*\u201cYou can fit a lot of compressed maps on, like, a 256-gigabyte SD card if you compress them the right way\u2026We can fit, you know, 10,000 plus-square kilometers,\u201d Laffey told Defense One. Uploading the maps onto the small computer that can be affixed to virtually any drone frame takes just a couple of hours.*\n\n*Laffey and his partners at Theseus are now working with a U.S. Army Special Operations group, Defense One confirmed, to test the drone in exercises and experiments. There\u2019s still plenty of work to do to make sure the system works across a wider array of altitudes and speeds, but those are solvable problems, he said.*\n\n*There have been multiple conversations with representatives from the Ukrainian military after that initial meeting, Laffey said. And they\u2019ve designed the system to accommodate for the fact that ground truth doesn\u2019t always fit the static picture.*\n\n*\u201cI mean, stuff gets blown up all the time. Like, houses just disappear.. If you're looking for a house and there's no house, what are you going to do?\u201d Laffey said.*\n\n*Theseus\u2019s story reveals a lot about the Pentagon\u2019s changing relationship with non-traditional companies and innovators. For example: breakthroughs in the defense space are no longer the sole domain of a handful of established defense contractors. Advances in AI\u2014coupled with decades-long trends in information technology\u2014are lowering the bar to bringing important new capabilities online. Now, a group of smart young people with no experience in the military can create new battlefield-relevant capabilities from cheap, easily available components, and do so at a fraction of the time and cost of a traditional defense contractor.*\n\n*It also shows that the culture of young Silicon Valley programmers and aspiring company founders is changing. The taboo of  collaborating with the Defense Department is not what it was in 2018, when Google programers objected so strongly to the company\u2019s work with the Pentagon that the company dropped the contract.*\n\n*But while startup culture is changing to become more Pentagon-friendly, the Pentagon still isn\u2019t changing fast enough to give young defense companies the support they need to grow, says Michael Brown, a partner at Shield Capital and the former head of the Defense Innovation Unit. \u201cUnfortunately, procurement from venture-backed startups represents only 1% of the procurement dollars of DOD,\u201d Brown told Defense One.*\n\n*Young founders aren\u2019t ready for the vetting and scrutiny that Defense Department money brings, he said: \u201cHow could they be?  Navigating DOD is still one of the most challenging of any customers, given that it's literally hundreds of individual buying entities that must conform to thousands of pages of acquisition rules and guidance. We have a long way to go beyond successful efforts like the Defense Innovation Unit to make it easy to sell to DOD,\u201d he said.*\n\n*But there are small changes the Defense Department could make in the way it usually buys things, particularly from dual-use or consumer tech companies.*\n\n*\u201cWhen the Defense Department buys commercial items, which the law requires when they are available, there's no need to undertake the traditional process of writing what the DOD would like to have built. Instead, there should simply be validating a need and beginning a selection process for vendors\u201d Brown said.*\n\n*The good news is, \u201cthere's plenty of U.S.-based capital, given the current boom in defense tech, which has increased an order of magnitude in recent years and attracted specialist firms like Shield Capital as well as generalist firms like a16z and General Catalyst,\u201d he said. \u201cThe obstacle for startups isn't a lack of U.S. capital, it is the Defense Department's lack of budget flexibility to rapidly shift appropriated funds to new technologies.\u201d*",

Instead, there should simply be validating a need and beginning a selection process for vendors\u201d Brown said.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The good news is, \u201cthere&#39;s plenty of U.S.-based capital, given the current boom in defense tech, which has increased an order of magnitude in recent years and attracted specialist firms like Shield Capital as well as generalist firms like a16z and General Catalyst,\u201d he said. \u201cThe obstacle for startups isn&#39;t a lack of U.S. capital, it is the Defense Department&#39;s lack of budget flexibility to rapidly shift appropriated funds to new technologies.\u201d</em></p>\n</div>",

There is a system called SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) but it requires the user to have easily detectable targets throughout the study area to correct itself. For instance, we usually use bright white/black targets, but if those aren't available you can use some kind of unique target like fire hydrants. Also they need to travel at a relatively slow and steady rate. So for instance, we had some inexperienced people collecting lidar with the SLAM method, but they didn't use enough targets, and they didn't double back over their previous collection area enough, and they weren't walking at a very steady pace. So the lidar unit had no real reference as to where it was exactly. The area they scanned was about the size of a football field, but from one end to the other the elevation accuracy was off by over a meter and there was no pattern to the error so there was no way to fix it in post-processing.\n\nAnother problem is if the lidar units aren't calibrated together they're going to have the same problem. We had one collection effort where a vehicle was collecting lidar from 3 different lidar devices attached to the top. They were never calibrated together, so it turned out the entire dataset had 3 different elevations. They were all attached to the same static mount. I can't really see how two different drone's lidar units could be calibrated together, like I pointed out in the SLAM discussion, they would lose their calibrated accuracy almost immediately. \n\nAnd again, these are datasets that currently take up terabytes of space and require at least a gaming laptop to process (but in reality to process it efficiently we have much more powerful workstations with dozens of cores and the latest high end hardware). \n\nAs you probably know, what you envision is basically done on some autonomous vehicles right now (although most use a combo of photogrammetry, lidar, radar, and other data sources that have taken years to collect for parts of certain cities so the car can compare the sensor data to know datasets). The computers that autonomous vehicles run are the size of large desktops and have significant on-board storage. They also also use a lot of energy (as much energy as a small house). For a lidar flight with a copter type drone right now you have to change the batteries quite often (about every 15-20 minutes). \n\nAlso one last thing regarding that point... lidar does best at a medium to long survey distance. Typically you fly them 200-400 feet above ground. Any closer and you aren't getting very good coverage and it will take much longer to scan the same area. So flying, for example, below the tree line and expecting to get a full picture of the surrounding area with lidar alone isn't very likely.

        "body": "Here's an analysis on the [economic aftermath](https://ridl.io/the-economic-aftermath-of-the-events-in-the-kursk-region/) of Ukraine's Kursk offensive:\n\n\n>Of course, in the context of Russia\u2019s almost infinite territory, the Kursk and Belgorod regions may seem rather small: they account for only 0.3% of the country\u2019s total area and 1.7% of its population. However, both have turned into major centres driving growth of the Russian agricultural industry over the past decades, ranking 1st or 2nd in pork, poultry and milk production, and classified among the Top 10 largest suppliers of sunflower, buckwheat and many other agricultural crops to the Russian market. Taken together, the Kursk and Belgorod regions accounted for 25.6% of total Russian pork production and 15.2% of poultry production before the war, and they topped the list of attractive \u2018low-risk\u2019 investment destinations. The livestock production in these regions has grown 2\u22126 times since 2010, putting the two administrative units among the main beneficiaries of the food embargo imposed in 2014. It is quite likely that if Ukrainian military units advance further, many pig and poultry farms could end up in the occupied zone (in the Belgorod region, about a half of them are located less than 30\u221240 kilometres from the border). The consequences for the Russian market are unlikely to be catastrophic, but under the prevailing policy of autarky, a 15\u221230% rise in meat prices in the central regions of Russia is almost guaranteed.\n\n>It should not be overlooked that the invasion by Ukrainian forces has also created serious problems in the transport sector. A large part of the Kursk and Belgorod regions are served by the Moscow Railway, which, due to the \u00abfederal-scale emergency\u00bb has experienced disruptions following the closure of some stations and routes. According to sources in the industry, the refusal to perform transport services has led to a massive accumulation of idle wagons and abandoned trains \u2014 the scale has been so high that the Russian Railways have already imposed restrictions on transport, also through the territory of Bryansk and Smolensk regions, thus seriously affecting the shipments from Belarus to Russia (and, notably, these restrictions have been imposed \u00abuntil further notice,\u00bb i.e. indefinitely for the time being). Indeed, this is just the beginning of negative consequences for the logistics industry, since an increased pressure on the key transport routes connecting Moscow with the south via Voronezh will ensue as an indirect consequence. One way or another, it will take at least several months for the transport industry to adapt to the new reality.\n\n>As the Ukrainian army draws closer to the Kursk nuclear power plant (NPP), this poses an even more significant threat. Although major industry experts who recently visited the plant are talking about the expected timely completion of new power units, the situation does not look unproblematic. Even after the final decommissioning of the second power unit in January 2024, the Kursk NPP provides energy to 19 Russia\u2019s regions, supplying 90% of the electricity consumed by the Kursk region, 76% by the Bryansk region and 70% by the Belgorod region. Also, the Mikhailovsky mining and refining facility, the Novolipetsk steel company, most of the Moscow Railway tracks and other major industrial enterprises in the region also depend on the Kursk power plant. Although it seems unlikely that the advancing Ukrainian troops may begin to occupy the plant (and direct strikes on the plant could provoke a disaster on an international scale), it is quite possible that long-range artillery and short-range missiles could strike the plant\u2019s high-voltage transmission grids from a distance of 20\u221225 kilometres, which could provoke a power collapse in the entire Central Region of Russia. The potential effect would be incomparable to the campaign heralded this spring about strikes on Russian oil processing plants.\n\n\nCreating havoc in Kursk and Belgorod will significantly add to Russia's inflationary pressure. In fact, Bloomberg has [previously blamed](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-22/russia-holds-rates-as-attacks-by-ukraine-stoke-inflation-risks) Russian inflation on Ukrainian attacks on Belgorod:\n\n\n>Now, traditionally affordable staples such as chicken may grow pricier as attacks continue on the Belgorod region, a major agricultural area that accounts for 14% of all of Russia\u2019s livestock and poultry production.\n\n\n\nNow the situation is exponentially worse. Ukraine is already occupying Russian territory, and is allowed to use Western artillery and GMLRS to shell Russia. The damage can be significant if Ukraine targets businesses and infrastructure.\n\n\n\nThe war in Ukraine can end with a military defeat, which seems increasingly unlikely, or a surrender. Since this war is existential for Ukraine and the West has already paid the price of an abrupt energy transition, it's most likely going to be Russia. However, circumstances could change in Ukraine or the West.",

The visits will be accompanied by an Israeli judge and Israel will confirm in advance the identity of the observers.\n\n>A senior Israeli official stated that Israel does not agree to allow visits by the Red Cross to the victims' prisoners as long as there are no similar visits to the abductees held in Gaza.\n\n>Most of the cabinet ministers voted in favor of Netanyahu's proposal. Ministers Itamar Ben Gabir and Bezalel Smotrich voted against.\n\nhttps://news.walla.co.il/item/3660406\n\n[Now the Israeli high court is pushing the gov to allow full and open international visitations to the Hamas terrorists that took part in the massacre](https://www.now14.co.il/%D7%91%D7%92%D7%A6-%D7%93%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%A9-%D7%9E%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%93%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%94-%D7%9C%D7%A0%D7%9E%D7%A7-%D7%9E%D7%93%D7%95%D7%A2-%D7%90%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%A8-%D7%9C%D7%A6%D7%9C%D7%91-%D7%94/)\n\n>that the state explain why the Red Cross is not allowed to visit Noach'vot\n\n>This morning the High Court issued a conditional order in which it demands that the state explain why they do not allow representatives of the Red Cross to visit security prisoners imprisoned in Israel, including the Nawab terrorists who carried out the brutal massacre on October 7 \u2022 The aforementioned order was received following a petition submitted by a number of organizations Human rights\" in the extreme left\n\nThere's a lot of political friction on the subject. As the right demands that any red cross visitations to the worst terrorists would be mirrored by visitations to the Israeli hostages, something Hamas refuses. \n\nHamas doesn't even know how many Nukhaba fighters and which are held by Israel, allowing visitations would make the negotiations more difficult as Hamas is likely to demand their release as part of a deal, something very difficult for large publics in Israel to accept.\n\nBen Gvir's position is that if the high court wants to force Israel to accept visitations for the Nukhba terrorists, let them dirty their hands doing so.",

The demand They forwarded it to Prime Minister Netanyahu and the security cabinet, which as mentioned is expected to discuss this tonight.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://news.walla.co.il/item/3687819\">https://news.walla.co.il/item/3687819</a></p>\n\n<p>In April some visitation to the Nukhba Hamas fighters were accepted by the Cabinet:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Also at the same meeting, the expanded War Cabinet approved the Prime Minister&#39;s proposal to allow two British observers to make a mock visit to some of the Nohva prisoners imprisoned in Israel. The visits will be accompanied by an Israeli judge and Israel will confirm in advance the identity of the observers.</p>\n\n<p>A senior Israeli official stated that Israel does not agree to allow visits by the Red Cross to the victims&#39; prisoners as long as there are no similar visits to the abductees held in Gaza.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the cabinet ministers voted in favor of Netanyahu&#39;s proposal. Ministers Itamar Ben Gabir and Bezalel Smotrich voted against.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://news.walla.co.il/item/3660406\">https://news.walla.co.il/item/3660406</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.now14.co.il/%D7%91%D7%92%D7%A6-%D7%93%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%A9-%D7%9E%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%93%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%94-%D7%9C%D7%A0%D7%9E%D7%A7-%D7%9E%D7%93%D7%95%D7%A2-%D7%90%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%A8-%D7%9C%D7%A6%D7%9C%D7%91-%D7%94/\">Now the Israeli high court is pushing the gov to allow full and open international visitations to the Hamas terrorists that took part in the massacre</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>that the state explain why the Red Cross is not allowed to visit Noach&#39;vot</p>\n\n<p>This morning the High Court issued a conditional order in which it demands that the state explain why they do not allow representatives of the Red Cross to visit security prisoners imprisoned in Israel, including the Nawab terrorists who carried out the brutal massacre on October 7 \u2022 The aforementioned order was received following a petition submitted by a number of organizations Human rights&quot; in the extreme left</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There&#39;s a lot of political friction on the subject. As the right demands that any red cross visitations to the worst terrorists would be mirrored by visitations to the Israeli hostages, something Hamas refuses. </p>\n\n<p>Hamas doesn&#39;t even know how many Nukhaba fighters and which are held by Israel, allowing visitations would make the negotiations more difficult as Hamas is likely to demand their release as part of a deal, something very difficult for large publics in Israel to accept.</p>\n\n<p>Ben Gvir&#39;s position is that if the high court wants to force Israel to accept visitations for the Nukhba terrorists, let them dirty their hands doing so.</p>\n</div>",

They will stop when they are compressed together such as in pokrovsk, where they are easier to supply and control. So i dont expect pokrovsk to be as much a cake walk for russia as things have been so far. Selidovo is showinf signs of resistance being more organized.</p>\n</div>",
