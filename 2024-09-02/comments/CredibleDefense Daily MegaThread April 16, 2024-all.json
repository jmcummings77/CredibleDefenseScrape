Either it shows a severe disconnect in the prosecution of the war and the impacts of their actions or it shows Zelensky putting politics ahead of pragmatism which in this case is going to reverberate for quite some time. \n\nGlad they passed it and thankfully this stupid chapter can close, but holy shit should it never have reached this point. I look forward to seeing more information on mobilization in the future because whilst this is good news, I do have my doubts as to how effective mobilization is going to be, atleast initially, which is why in my mind it was imperative Ukraine get a head start on this process and not leave things to the 11th hour. \n\nI don't think this is some war ending move but Ukraine already has a huge amount of disadvantages facing off against Russia in both an institutional and material manner, allowing manpower issues to be added to that was baffling.",

Everyone who bribed or cheated their way out of military service earlier in the war, when TCC corruption was still rampant, are back in the pool. \n- Minimum mobilization age lowered from 27 to 25. \n- Removed demobilization, which would have made the problem worse in the near future \n- Ex-cons can serve, minus those involved with treason. \n\nThe Bad\n- Didn't include electronic summons, which would have made it easier for the TCC to reach the masses, who currently can only give them out by hand at home addresses\n- Didn't gut deferments like college, which was being blatantly abused\n- Didn't include penalties like freezing of funds for draft dodgers. This just incentives those avoiding service illegally. \n- Didn't lower mobilization age enough, it should be lowered to 18 to match conscription age.\n- No provisions regarding minimum training lengths, amount of service on the front lines, or overall length of service, all of which were serious detractors for those contemplating military service\n\nOverall, the job of the TCC wasn't really made easier by this bill. Not only is the recruitment pool not dramatically expanded, they still lack the ability to find eligible Mobiks or compel them to serve beyond what they were already doing. \n\nWorst of all, where is the media campaign attached to this? Why did Zelensky distance himself from this topic for six months despite personally controlling the nationwide propaganda machine? One of the biggest causes beyond demographics causing this crisis is apathy and lack of motivation, but it seems little was done to address that. \n\n>allowing manpower issues to be added to that was baffling.\n\nBankova Street bet everything that their summer offensive would be victorious and didn't plan at all in case it wasn't. \n\nThat's why they pressed the offensive for five months despite it being clear in the first week that the plan wasn't realistic, and why they flipped their shit when Zaluzhny publicly admitted in November that the offensive failed and they were in a stalemate. Classic denial. \n\nThe Zelensky admin only admitted their offensive failed in mid November, at which point they had to acknowledge a total lack of strategy as well as this manpower crisis. Suddenly they were also forced to finally allocate funding to fortifications they deliberately neglected too, for the same reason as mobilization: not a problem when Russia is strategically defeated and forced to retreat to survive. \n\nNone of these reforms are the ideas of Zelensky's admin, they're being forced on them, which is why they aren't motivated to fix them.

Someone can't just hide and avoid receiving the paper in-person. Upon the summons being sent, the person is forbidden to leave the country.

I don't think it would work very well.\n\nUltimately, Russia ended up solving the manpower issue for now mostly by throwing money at it, but the mobilization order is still in effect and it would take only one phone call for people to start to get drafted again. Most Russians either don't realize that or try to forget about it; this time they wouldn't just be able to escape abroad.\n\n\nContrast this to the law that Ukraine passed after all this time and discussion, with such a pressing need for an effective mobilization reform, when the future of the country is literally at stake. I am flabbergasted. I know they don't want to just copy what Russia did, but they needed a better version of the system, not an inferior one. At least they addressed medical referrals and tried to reach those who are abroad.\n\nFrom the outside, it is hard to not notice and strongly agree with the TDF soldier quoted by /u/pg449 \"5% of the country is fighting while the rest lives their lives more or less like nothing's going on\" or /u/Shackleton214 \"Russia calls it a special military operation and treats it as a war, and Ukraine calls it a war and treats it as a special military operation\". I know that everyone in the country is suffering, but the distribution seems very uneven and unfair, especially to those fighting from day 1.\n\n\nOn a personal note, I am not a military person. I would be beyond terrified if I was called up and got told to sit in a trench and eat artillery fire, even if the existence of my country depended on it. But, if I knew that I would get decent training, that everyone has to do it, and that there is a hard limit to how long I have to be there until some other poor bastard has to take my spot, then it would be much easier for me to accept getting drafted. I believe that Ukraine is trying to provide more training now and that should help. But without some rules for demobilizing to give some hope to cling on to, unless the average unmobilized Ukrainian is braver than me, they will continue to have massive issues with draft dodging.\n\n\nI read this subreddit often, but do not post much. After the Ukrainian counter-offensive ended it was up to US, EU, and Ukraine to get their shit together to determine the direction of the war. I actually believe that the EU will come through, even if late, which should be enough to prevent a complete collapse of the front for Ukraine. But with half-assed efforts like these and \"uneven\" support from the US, it seems like grinding down Russian advances and stalling until the conflict is frozen is the best outcome Ukraine can realistically hope for.",

That said, the Iranians use a lot of these, as well as their Chinese copy, the Type 59. We&#39;ll see if their use gets expanded, or if they&#39;ll remain in small-scale service like other platforms such as the D-1.</p>\n</div>",

Like, what&#39;s going on, is there a breakout there, or what&#39;s the deal?</p>\n\n<p>And at least scanning through a few other channels I know about (on either side) no one else I&#39;ve seen knows what&#39;s the deal either.  Most of them aren&#39;t even acknowledging something unusual is happening, including a few Russian ones and Ukrainian ones that would cry the blues if they thought something horrible was happening.  I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a good sign or a bad sign.</p>\n\n<p>The open space between stepove and Ocheretyne is in and of itself not hugely consequential but the speed of them crossing it (and the salient they formed) is abnormal.</p>\n</div>",

If anything, losses have been very stable at a ~2.8:1 Ru:Ukr ratio [since Ukraine lost the initiative](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_ratio.jpg?). \n\nHowever twitter user @whitherapathy has put together a very compelling analysis that something has changed which is not visible in the top lines most people (myself included) look at. They analyzed by specific model type, then calculated the Gini coefficient, which tells us about the concentration of losses in a particular type (you may have heard of this in discussions about economic inequality). \n\n[They found](https://x.com/whitherapathy/status/1779862902838563161?s=61) that there was strong concentration of losses among a specific types of vehicles at the start of the invasion due to a high Gini coefficient of 0.75. This declined to a nadir of ~0.35 or so during the Kharkiv counteroffensive, when the diversity of losses increased. This is more easily apparent in the [inverse calculation](https://x.com/whitherapathy/status/1779863653597995283?s=61), \u201cthe effective number of parties\u201d. This high rate of diverse Russian losses persisted until their assault on Avdiivka began in October 2023, when both metrics return to the range of the initial invasion. Today the Gini coefficient is around 0.55-0.60. If you want to look at the raw data by individual losses, you can find them in my daily tracker [here](https://github.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/tree/main/data/bySystem/Raw/Daily), though note this is very raw data. I produce empty CSVs on days when Jakub does not update, so you may have to go back a couple days to find a given day\u2019s data. \n\nI think this adds an extra dimension to discussions about stability for the Russian army. It may not be the top lines that are as important for their advance as specific equipment types may be to support the kind of forward movements they plan to do. From a purely statistical point of view, did they put mass offensive operations on pause until they could build up reserves of similar equipment types to support a broader advance? I guess my question is, would they want to have a lot of the same kind of systems (e.g. reduce effective number of classes) for planning purposes? I don\u2019t know the right way to interpret this, but the inequality data (e.g. concentration of losses to fewer types of equipment) seems to indicate something very different about the Russian attacks this year compared to last .",

        "body": "There continues to be more integration among the militiaries of the American backed alliance against China.  American allies are attempting to copy the Marine littoral regiment and the U.S. is working to be able to utilize international partners for the logistical issues a conflict across the Pacific would entail. \n\nInteroperability is going to continue to increase as a significant part of deterrence.  \n\n[The Marines\u2019 Pacific allies are copying its littoral regiment moves | Defense News | April 2024](https://www.defensenews.com/news/your-marine-corps/2024/04/09/the-marines-pacific-allies-are-copying-its-littoral-regiment-moves/)\n\n*The Corps\u2019 top operations general is seeing Pacific allies copy some of the new littoral-based war-fighting concepts that the service\u2019s has developed to counter China in the region. Speaking at the Navy League\u2019s Sea-Air-Space conference here on Monday, Lt. Gen. James Bierman, deputy commandant for plans, policies and operations, laid out challenges the U.S. military faces in the Western Pacific and moves the Marines are making to address those gaps.*\n\n*The three key challenges are \u201ctime, space and access,\u201d Bierman said.*\n\n*\u201cMuch as they might like to think so, the (People\u2019s Republic of China) is not 10-feet tall,\u201d Bierman said. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say they\u2019re not worthy of respect, and we do respect them, they\u2019re working very hard, they\u2019re building lots of capacity, but they struggle with doubt and uncertainty and we\u2019re purposefully campaigning and posturing to maintain and magnify their doubt and unease.\u201d*\n\n*To meet those challenges, Bierman said, the Corps has focused efforts on its units both already within the U.S. Navy fleet and those inside of the first island chain and \u201cweapons engagement zone.\u201d*\n\n*The island chain refers to a string of islands from the Kuril Islands in the north, sweeping south through Okinawa, Japan, Taiwan and the Philippines, paralleling Russian, North Korean and Chinese shores.*\n\n*Partner and allied nations in that same chain are training alongside Marines in new ways, focused on detecting, targeting and striking enemy naval vessels. \u201cThey\u2019re very much seeing the problem the same way,\u201d Bierman said. \u201cWhich is how in distributed naval terrain do you sense and make sense; do you synchronize and coordinate in combined operations. How do you establish the right linkages for command and control?\u201d*\n\n*The Marines think they have the answer: the Marine littoral regiment.*\n\n*In recent years, the Corps has developed the littoral regiment as purpose-built for littoral combat, or fighting in the shallower reaches where land, islands and archipelagos meet ocean.*\n\n*The 3rd Marine Littoral Regiment operates out of Hawaii. The 12th Marine Littoral Regiment was redesignated in 2023 in Okinawa, Japan, and another regiment is planned to form in Guam in 2027. The regiments hold 2,000 Marines each, about the size of a Marine expeditionary unit, but with different capabilities. They have fewer infantry but contain their own air control and air defense units, a medium missile battery instead of conventional artillery and more advanced logistics capabilities.*\n\n*Bierman said that military partners and allies in South Korea, Japan, Taiwan and the Philippines are either copying elements of the littoral combat concept or were working toward these moves even as the Corps began developing it. Following the panel discussion, he told Marine Corps Times that each nation is taking its own approach, some weighting the units more toward sensing capabilities, others toward lethal strike capabilities. He declined to discuss specific equipment, platforms or capabilities by country.*\n\n*The 3rd Marine Littoral Regiment has been participating in various exercises, chiefly with the Philippines\u2019 armed forces, since 2022. The 12th Marine Littoral Regiment, still under construction, will primarily work with the Japanese military.*\n\n*The Japanese military developed its first amphibious rapid deployment brigade in 2018. In March, it activated the 3rd Regiment within the brigade for defense of its southwest region, U.S. Naval Institute reported. It also formed and deployed an electronic warfare unit to Yonaguni Island, Japan, in March.*\n\n*Bierman previously served as commanding general of III Marine Expeditionary Force, the only forward-deployed Marine expeditionary force, and lead force in the Pacific. \u201cOur allies and partners are all in,\u201d Bierman said. \u201cThey are feeling the heat, they\u2019re tired of getting pushed around in their own backyards.\u201d*\n\n*In January, the Philippines announced its Comprehensive Archipelagic Defense Concept, a shift to join its army, air force and navy in an external security focus instead of its previous concentration on external security. The move has been described as a move to counter Chinese military aggression and incursion into the nation\u2019s territorial waters.*\n\n*Bierman noted an uptick in various military exercises. The large-scale, multinational naval exercise Rim of the Pacific, the U.S.-Australia annual Talisman Sabre exercise and the U.S.-Philippines exercise Balikatan have grown steadily in size and scope in recent years. And those exercises are not simple live fires. The Marine littoral regiment is working sensing and ship targeting, passing data and conducting command and control alongside host nation partners.*\n\n*Using these exercises to highlight how the U.S. and its partners are working on shared aims for another target \u2015 deterrence.*\n\n*\u201cEverything we do in INDOPACOM is done with an eye toward cognitive impact on potential adversaries,\u201d Bierman said. \u201cNothing sends a message of deterrence and unsettles our adversaries like true interoperability.\u201d*\n\n[To Meet Critical Pacific Logistics Needs, U.S. Navy To Lean On International Help | The Warzone | April 2024](https://www.twz.com/sea/to-meet-critical-pacific-logistics-needs-u-s-navy-to-lean-on-international-help)\n\n*In the projected near-peer fight of the future, the head of the U.S. Navy's Military Sealift Command is under no illusions: U.S.-flagged tankers won't be enough to meet the Defense Department's fueling needs.*\n\n*Despite efforts like the Tanker Security Program, which in 2021 empowered the Department of Transportation to create an ad-hoc 10-ship expanded U.S.-flagged tanker fleet in a crisis, the sort of conflict the U.S. is preparing for will require \"all comers,\" Rear Adm. Phillip Sobeck told an audience Wednesday at the Navy League's Sea Air Space 2024 symposium near Washington, D.C.*\n\n*Military Sealift Command's fleet of 140 ships can surge to more than 400 in a time of need, Sobeck said, referring to a surge capacity that involves U.S.-flagged commercial ships. But to meet the needs of distributed maritime operations and other high-priority initiatives, such as the Air Force's Agile Combat Employment (ACE) scheme of maneuver, \"we just don't have an inherent fleet that can do it,\" Sobeck said.*\n\n*China is rapidly gapping American shipbuilding capacity, augmenting fears that a future war will find the U.S. overwhelmed in the maritime domain and unable to get effective and timely resupply from U.S. ships. A Navy briefing slide obtained by The War Zone last year showed China controlling 40% of global commercial shipbuilding, with an eye-watering shipbuilding capacity of more than 200 times that of the U.S.*\n\n*Even MSC's plans to support Navy assets in a major conflict are hindered by a grim reality: obtaining the manpower needed to execute a surge, even if the aging sealift fleet could handle it, would leave essentially no personnel in reserve, and the Navy escort ships needed to ensure logistics ships can safely complete their missions would likely be unavailable in the quantities required.*\n\n*Ann Wood, director of product support management at Naval Air Systems Command, said repairs and maintenance must also create more space for collaboration. The Air Force's ACE strategy already increases opportunities for members of different U.S. services to support each other's missions and maintenance at austere bases with limited personnel. But Wood said she wanted to see more maintenance of U.S. equipment done by allied militaries who operate the same platforms.*\n\n*In the Pacific, meanwhile, the U.S. and Japan are in talks for an arrangement that would enable Japanese shipyards to conduct routine maintenance and overhaul of U.S. Navy hulls. This would both keep U.S. ships in the region as a deterrent and ease some of the burden on American shipyards.*\n\n*But Wood revealed Wednesday that, behind the scenes, red tape created unspecified obstacles and delays.*\n\n*\"Policy really kicked our tails,\" she said. \"So what we've been doing is working with [the office of the chief of naval operations] and OSD in identifying all those policies that hinder us from leveraging the capabilities in those countries and our partner nations.\"*\n\n*Wood added that this work applied not just to shared maintenance, but also to partner-aided resupply. Moving forward, she said, more partnered maintenance efforts are underway, including another initiative in Australia involving the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, which both the U.S. Navy and Australian Air Force fly.*",

American allies are attempting to copy the Marine littoral regiment and the U.S. is working to be able to utilize international partners for the logistical issues a conflict across the Pacific would entail. </p>\n\n<p>Interoperability is going to continue to increase as a significant part of deterrence.  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.defensenews.com/news/your-marine-corps/2024/04/09/the-marines-pacific-allies-are-copying-its-littoral-regiment-moves/\">The Marines\u2019 Pacific allies are copying its littoral regiment moves | Defense News | April 2024</a></p>\n\n<p><em>The Corps\u2019 top operations general is seeing Pacific allies copy some of the new littoral-based war-fighting concepts that the service\u2019s has developed to counter China in the region. Speaking at the Navy League\u2019s Sea-Air-Space conference here on Monday, Lt. Gen. James Bierman, deputy commandant for plans, policies and operations, laid out challenges the U.S. military faces in the Western Pacific and moves the Marines are making to address those gaps.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The three key challenges are \u201ctime, space and access,\u201d Bierman said.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cMuch as they might like to think so, the (People\u2019s Republic of China) is not 10-feet tall,\u201d Bierman said. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say they\u2019re not worthy of respect, and we do respect them, they\u2019re working very hard, they\u2019re building lots of capacity, but they struggle with doubt and uncertainty and we\u2019re purposefully campaigning and posturing to maintain and magnify their doubt and unease.\u201d</em></p>\n\n<p><em>To meet those challenges, Bierman said, the Corps has focused efforts on its units both already within the U.S. Navy fleet and those inside of the first island chain and \u201cweapons engagement zone.\u201d</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The island chain refers to a string of islands from the Kuril Islands in the north, sweeping south through Okinawa, Japan, Taiwan and the Philippines, paralleling Russian, North Korean and Chinese shores.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Partner and allied nations in that same chain are training alongside Marines in new ways, focused on detecting, targeting and striking enemy naval vessels. \u201cThey\u2019re very much seeing the problem the same way,\u201d Bierman said. \u201cWhich is how in distributed naval terrain do you sense and make sense; do you synchronize and coordinate in combined operations. How do you establish the right linkages for command and control?\u201d</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The Marines think they have the answer: the Marine littoral regiment.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>In recent years, the Corps has developed the littoral regiment as purpose-built for littoral combat, or fighting in the shallower reaches where land, islands and archipelagos meet ocean.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The 3rd Marine Littoral Regiment operates out of Hawaii. The 12th Marine Littoral Regiment was redesignated in 2023 in Okinawa, Japan, and another regiment is planned to form in Guam in 2027. The regiments hold 2,000 Marines each, about the size of a Marine expeditionary unit, but with different capabilities. They have fewer infantry but contain their own air control and air defense units, a medium missile battery instead of conventional artillery and more advanced logistics capabilities.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Bierman said that military partners and allies in South Korea, Japan, Taiwan and the Philippines are either copying elements of the littoral combat concept or were working toward these moves even as the Corps began developing it. Following the panel discussion, he told Marine Corps Times that each nation is taking its own approach, some weighting the units more toward sensing capabilities, others toward lethal strike capabilities. He declined to discuss specific equipment, platforms or capabilities by country.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The 3rd Marine Littoral Regiment has been participating in various exercises, chiefly with the Philippines\u2019 armed forces, since 2022. The 12th Marine Littoral Regiment, still under construction, will primarily work with the Japanese military.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The Japanese military developed its first amphibious rapid deployment brigade in 2018. In March, it activated the 3rd Regiment within the brigade for defense of its southwest region, U.S. Naval Institute reported. It also formed and deployed an electronic warfare unit to Yonaguni Island, Japan, in March.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Bierman previously served as commanding general of III Marine Expeditionary Force, the only forward-deployed Marine expeditionary force, and lead force in the Pacific. \u201cOur allies and partners are all in,\u201d Bierman said. \u201cThey are feeling the heat, they\u2019re tired of getting pushed around in their own backyards.\u201d</em></p>\n\n<p><em>In January, the Philippines announced its Comprehensive Archipelagic Defense Concept, a shift to join its army, air force and navy in an external security focus instead of its previous concentration on external security. The move has been described as a move to counter Chinese military aggression and incursion into the nation\u2019s territorial waters.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Bierman noted an uptick in various military exercises. The large-scale, multinational naval exercise Rim of the Pacific, the U.S.-Australia annual Talisman Sabre exercise and the U.S.-Philippines exercise Balikatan have grown steadily in size and scope in recent years. And those exercises are not simple live fires. The Marine littoral regiment is working sensing and ship targeting, passing data and conducting command and control alongside host nation partners.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Using these exercises to highlight how the U.S. and its partners are working on shared aims for another target \u2015 deterrence.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cEverything we do in INDOPACOM is done with an eye toward cognitive impact on potential adversaries,\u201d Bierman said. \u201cNothing sends a message of deterrence and unsettles our adversaries like true interoperability.\u201d</em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.twz.com/sea/to-meet-critical-pacific-logistics-needs-u-s-navy-to-lean-on-international-help\">To Meet Critical Pacific Logistics Needs, U.S. Navy To Lean On International Help | The Warzone | April 2024</a></p>\n\n<p><em>In the projected near-peer fight of the future, the head of the U.S. Navy&#39;s Military Sealift Command is under no illusions: U.S.-flagged tankers won&#39;t be enough to meet the Defense Department&#39;s fueling needs.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Despite efforts like the Tanker Security Program, which in 2021 empowered the Department of Transportation to create an ad-hoc 10-ship expanded U.S.-flagged tanker fleet in a crisis, the sort of conflict the U.S. is preparing for will require &quot;all comers,&quot; Rear Adm.

The first was destroyed in Russia\u2019s Belgorod region, according to the source\u2019s data.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The Russian Nebo-U, a modernized version of the Soviet-era Nebo radar, is intended for detecting, measuring the coordinates and tracking air targets of various categories from aircraft to cruise and guided missiles, including small hypersonic, ballistic and subtle missiles using stealth technologies at 600 km. The complex was adopted by the Russian army in 1995.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>In March, the Special Operations Forces (SSO) announced the successful destruction of the Zhitel Russian electronic warfare complex in the Zaporizhzhia region.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Previously, the SSO reported the successful destruction of the Russian Zoopark-1 surveillance and fire control radar complex, a highly valued asset often touted by the Russian military. The radar station, along with its crew, was eliminated. According to open-source data, the complex is estimated to cost approximately $10-15 million.</em></p>\n</div>",

It seems, absolutely nothing.</p>\n\n<p>I guess it could explain why Biden chose to do his &quot;don&#39;t&quot; shtick when he knew he wouldn&#39;t penalize Iran for calling his bluff.

By all accounts those were Israeli drones flown onto Iran by Israel, and kind of is the only way Israel has of attacking Iran unprovoked, because it doesn't have weapons capable of getting there without either the permission of countries that cannot give it in a vacuum, or taking significant risks by overflying deep into hostile territory. \n\nIsrael also carries out attacks that are similar to what Hezbollah does, by funding various terrorist groups to attack Iranian assets, and they've been doing that for over 20 years. \n\nI'm talking here specifically about direct attacks.

Whether it was wise to have established this state is always up for debate. </p>\n\n<p>But no, I think it&#39;s disingenuous to suggest that long-held leftist beliefs about the Israeli/Palestinian conflict are the work of Russian or Chinese or Iranian troll farms. These protests are cropping up because of current events, and many leftists feel very strongly about this issue because of the ongoing narrative about oppression. (Some are motivated by latent antisemitism too, but I think that&#39;s a minority belief.)</p>\n\n<p>I have many leftist friends who post frequently about the conflict on social media and partake in these protests. For better or for worse, their beliefs are genuine. Propaganda might play a role, but most leftists like to choreograph unity on certain beliefs.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "[The article here is basically just copying a post on Quora](https://theaviationgeekclub.com/us-navy-operations-specialist-explains-why-ukrainian-f-16s-will-most-probably-win-bvr-engagements-against-russian-su-35s/amp/), the 3 comments left by a person bellow the article are quite informative. But I am not really that knowledgeable, I found it interesting to read. It would be great if someone here had more experience and knowledge and then they could share the opinion on these comments.\n\nI will quote the first comment below: \n\n> Hi to author. If I may ,I will give now some real military tactical and technical facts,data and info. When we talk about possible BVR engegaments there is really no chance for the light single-engined 4th gen fighter F-16.Even if we not count on AWACS help (on its long range air surveillance ,detecting,tracking and vectoring of fighters via digit data link or voice comm) ,Su-35S is far superior and has far more chances to win in any possible tactical situation in BVR engagement.First ,his hybrid monopulse ( not pulse -Doppler like in F-16) ESA radar N035 Irbis is hybrid 'cause it has possibilities of both PESA and AESA.PESA 'cause it has almost 1800 TRE (transreceive elements) on the antenna reflectors and those two TWT's. AESA 'cause in input signals domain,every TRE has its own receive signal processing channel like in PESA N011M Bars-M.In output signal domain,every TRE has its own digital heterodyne signal channel.In fact, waveguide unit inside of the antenna reflector has very inovative digital hybrid-heterodyne output signal system.So N035 can perform like every AESA with sending so many signals/beams simultaenously with different patterns,differ working frequencies and with very high frequency agility(over 1000 times pour sec). It can detect/track e.g. incoming MiG-21 with frontal RCS in centimetric X-band from 450kms away in so called PPS-DO narrow FoV combat mode ( front hemisphere- further detection).Frontal RCS of armed F-16 is much bigger.For those who do not know this fact,N035 Irbis has two huge and very powerfull TWT's where the main has 5kW's on average power in HPRF mode and secondary has 2kW's of average power in HPRF mode.The main can work in narrow FoV PPS-DO mode ,secondary can work in normal ( wide FoV) PPS mode simultaneously.One thing more, N035 has antenna reflector on two-step electro-hydraulic drive (gimbal) ,so total FoV can be increased from 120\u00b0 (+/-60\u00b0 in azimuth and elevation ) to 240\u00b0, twice as much as of F-16's radar.From tactical point of view it is very important for so called 'beaming tactics' (excellent SLAR capabilities).So,Su-35S can fly very high e.g in upper stratosphere and can detect/track something that flies very low (even low flying cruise missiles or hovering heli's) or can fly very low and can detect/track something that flies very high.F-16 with his radars( old mechanical or even new electronic/AESA) cannot perform that. In High PRF mode with PRF of 300kHz ,max output pulse power of the main TWT is 20kW's and lock-on range in any tactical case/situation with or without enemy radar jamming is 80% of detect/track distance.There is new OLS-35 with 20cm in diameter IRST( MWIR band) that can detect/track incoming fighter on Full AB mode flying in stratosphere from distance of 400kms.Also can detect/track incoming fighter flying on Military Mode(non AB mode) from 80-100kms away. About jamming possibilities of F-16,I can only write this.Ukrainian ex-soviet fighters MiG-29 ( Product 9.13) and Su-27S/P have much stronger jammers from '80s like L203 Gardeniya and L005 Sorbtsiya with waveguide units based on PESA technology.About AAM, there is no R-77M in RuA&SF inventory ,Su-35S possess new Russian R-77-1 (Product 170-1).On March 5 2022 ,two Su-35S engaged group of four ukr fighters Su-27 in BVR with R-77-1 from the distances of 60 and 80kms. All four Su-27's were shot down in the vicinity of Zhytomir(take a look on map where is that city).R-77-1 vs any AMRAAM.First can withstand 50G lateral G-load in both active and passive phase of flight,second only 30G.For outmanauvering/ evading ,engaged fighter must perform 12G turn for the first and 8-9G for the second AAM. First has 50\u00b0 AoA limit,second only 35\u00b0,first has 150\u00b0/sec turn rate in both phases of flight second 120\u00b0/sec only in passive fligth phase.Time of aerodynamic stability and controlability is 120sec for the first,90sec for the second(AIM-120D).Real Mach number limit for aerodynamic stability and controlability is 0.5M-4.5M for the first and 1.5M-4M for the second.Besides new medium/long range R-77-1, for engaging big (non maneuvering)air targets,Su-35S possess new heavy very long range hypersonic R-37M with max possible authorised launch distance of 400kms (high speed,high alt launch parameters).

But I am not really that knowledgeable, I found it interesting to read. It would be great if someone here had more experience and knowledge and then they could share the opinion on these comments.</p>\n\n<p>I will quote the first comment below: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hi to author. If I may ,I will give now some real military tactical and technical facts,data and info. When we talk about possible BVR engegaments there is really no chance for the light single-engined 4th gen fighter F-16.Even if we not count on AWACS help (on its long range air surveillance ,detecting,tracking and vectoring of fighters via digit data link or voice comm) ,Su-35S is far superior and has far more chances to win in any possible tactical situation in BVR engagement.First ,his hybrid monopulse ( not pulse -Doppler like in F-16) ESA radar N035 Irbis is hybrid &#39;cause it has possibilities of both PESA and AESA.PESA &#39;cause it has almost 1800 TRE (transreceive elements) on the antenna reflectors and those two TWT&#39;s. AESA &#39;cause in input signals domain,every TRE has its own receive signal processing channel like in PESA N011M Bars-M.In output signal domain,every TRE has its own digital heterodyne signal channel.In fact, waveguide unit inside of the antenna reflector has very inovative digital hybrid-heterodyne output signal system.So N035 can perform like every AESA with sending so many signals/beams simultaenously with different patterns,differ working frequencies and with very high frequency agility(over 1000 times pour sec). It can detect/track e.g. incoming MiG-21 with frontal RCS in centimetric X-band from 450kms away in so called PPS-DO narrow FoV combat mode ( front hemisphere- further detection).Frontal RCS of armed F-16 is much bigger.For those who do not know this fact,N035 Irbis has two huge and very powerfull TWT&#39;s where the main has 5kW&#39;s on average power in HPRF mode and secondary has 2kW&#39;s of average power in HPRF mode.The main can work in narrow FoV PPS-DO mode ,secondary can work in normal ( wide FoV) PPS mode simultaneously.One thing more, N035 has antenna reflector on two-step electro-hydraulic drive (gimbal) ,so total FoV can be increased from 120\u00b0 (+/-60\u00b0 in azimuth and elevation ) to 240\u00b0, twice as much as of F-16&#39;s radar.From tactical point of view it is very important for so called &#39;beaming tactics&#39; (excellent SLAR capabilities).So,Su-35S can fly very high e.g in upper stratosphere and can detect/track something that flies very low (even low flying cruise missiles or hovering heli&#39;s) or can fly very low and can detect/track something that flies very high.F-16 with his radars( old mechanical or even new electronic/AESA) cannot perform that. In High PRF mode with PRF of 300kHz ,max output pulse power of the main TWT is 20kW&#39;s and lock-on range in any tactical case/situation with or without enemy radar jamming is 80% of detect/track distance.There is new OLS-35 with 20cm in diameter IRST( MWIR band) that can detect/track incoming fighter on Full AB mode flying in stratosphere from distance of 400kms.Also can detect/track incoming fighter flying on Military Mode(non AB mode) from 80-100kms away. About jamming possibilities of F-16,I can only write this.Ukrainian ex-soviet fighters MiG-29 ( Product 9.13) and Su-27S/P have much stronger jammers from &#39;80s like L203 Gardeniya and L005 Sorbtsiya with waveguide units based on PESA technology.About AAM, there is no R-77M in RuA&amp;SF inventory ,Su-35S possess new Russian R-77-1 (Product 170-1).On March 5 2022 ,two Su-35S engaged group of four ukr fighters Su-27 in BVR with R-77-1 from the distances of 60 and 80kms.
