Training units were sent to the front in the summer, and a lot of the regular units operating at two thirds' strength (so that the remaining third could be conscripts) had been battered or even reconstituted. The only real training off the front lines of Russian units that we know of is happening in Belarus.\n\nThere's been limited training and high casuslties among the mobilized, and with the announcement of mobilization not resulting in significant pushback domestically, there's little stopping Russia from just conscripting more to replace those lost. The raw number of personnel just isn't a bottleneck for Russian capabilities anymore. In fact, I'd go so far as saying the influx of mobilized men is turning everything else into a bottleneck, and things such as \"Wagner tactics\" are attempts to circumvent these limitations.",

Given the assessment that Wagner recruited ~50,000 prisoners at around the same time the mobilization started, they weren&#39;t even limited by this number when it went into effect.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, Russian capabilities to absorb conscripts into the military properly were compromised before mobilization. Training units were sent to the front in the summer, and a lot of the regular units operating at two thirds&#39; strength (so that the remaining third could be conscripts) had been battered or even reconstituted. The only real training off the front lines of Russian units that we know of is happening in Belarus.</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s been limited training and high casuslties among the mobilized, and with the announcement of mobilization not resulting in significant pushback domestically, there&#39;s little stopping Russia from just conscripting more to replace those lost. The raw number of personnel just isn&#39;t a bottleneck for Russian capabilities anymore. In fact, I&#39;d go so far as saying the influx of mobilized men is turning everything else into a bottleneck, and things such as &quot;Wagner tactics&quot; are attempts to circumvent these limitations.</p>\n</div>",

Have we heard anything of them donating T-55s to UA?</p>\n\n<p>In this conflict, tanks have overwhelmingly been used in an infantry support roll. T-55s, though vulnerable, are still adequate to the task from what I can tell. </p>\n\n<p>I think instead of laughing at RU for scrapping the bottom of their barrel, it might be more constructive to use this as an excuse to do a bit of scrapping ourselves. </p>\n\n<p>A tank can be outdated, but so long as it has a big gun, and can provide a level of protection greater than a standard APC, then it has tactical potential in my opinion.</p>\n</div>",

            "body": "Concerning valid sources, there was a lot of talk about the Baltics and Suwalki Gap under Trump. A [RAND paper](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1200/RR1253/RAND_RR1253.pdf) also made a lot of noise in 2016, creating doubts over NATO's capacity (and will) to actually defend its allies. The problem was that Russia was seen as being able to very quickly advance through the Baltics, faster than NATO would have been able to initially respond (outside of nuclear retaliation), and then \"freeze\" their advances by extending their nuclear umbrella over them. This is at a time when there are still a lot of unknowns about how NATO would answer such a situation (POTUS Trump notably said ([when talking about Montenegro's recent adhesion](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/19/how-trump-destabilised-montenegro-with-a-few-words)) that Eastern NATO member states could \"start WW3\" and emitted doubts about sending US troops to help them; it was a shock to Poland and the Baltic states, which still feel threatened (for good reason) by Russia). Beyond the US, some of France's top candidates at the last presidential elections have been saying similar things in the past (Melenchon, Le Pen, ...), while the UK's Corbyn has talked about wanting to see NATO disbanded; these are or were potential leaders in all of NATO's nuclear powers (which are also its strongest military powers). A lot of it is similar to old debates about NATO, reinvigorated by what was seen as an isolationist turn in US foreign policy and a more agressive turn in its Russian counterpart; \"how far are western NATO member states ready to go to defend their Easternmost allies? Does NATO's nuclear umbrella truly cover non-nuclear member states?\"). I think a lot of those fears have actually been assuaged now that the state of Russia's military has been witnessed in Ukraine (even though critics warn that \"this is not how Russia would fight in the Baltics\"), although the fact that they'd launch a large scale war of conquest in Europe is of course unsettling for border states.\n\nIn addition to these doubts over US commitment, Russia has also embraced a very agressive rhetoric since 2022, with public threats to invade, occupy and nuke a number of NATO countries (the UK and Poland being recurrent targets in Russian state media). This is mostly non-credible of course, empty threats which aim at solidifying Russian support/weakening Western resolve and sense of security in the context of their response to the war in Ukraine (in France for example, this was used by Melenchon in particular to try and reduce support for Ukraine, by saying that arming Ukraine would make France a \"cobelligerent\" and put it under threat of Russian military attacks), but it's also indicative of what could be a lasting degradation of relations and future brinkmanship etc, and certainly feeds fears among part of the public.\n\nHere's my take on the \"Poland/Baltics will be next\" stuff. If Russia had managed to easily take most of Ukraine at little cost, I think it might have made a resurgence of European wars, annexations etc. more likely (even if still marginal, but this is a big part of why Finland and Sweden are trying to join NATO and why the Nordics have adopted plans to increase military cooperation and coordination), but it would have surely made relations between CEE countries and Russia much more tense. There's lots of reasons why these Eastern/Nordic/Central European states don't want to see Russia succeed, and, as they fear that Western states are less committed to Russia's defeat, they've adopted this rhetoric that \"they will be next\" if Russia is allowed to take Ukraine so as to shore up engagement by other NATO member states. Behind the rhetoric, there are real fears, but there's also some exaggeration (at least in the short term), there's an interest in fuelling the idea that Russia will attack a NATO member state which goes beyond how credible that actually is. In their eyes, in an unpredictable future, where the US might or might not withdraw from NATO, where NATO might or might not disappear as an alliance (or at least, be partially neutered by doubts about its article 5 credibility), their best bet for long term survival in the worst case scenario is Russia's defeat in Ukraine. When they say \"they will be next\" (or \"Ukraine is fighting for all of us\", etc), they (for the most part) don't actually believe there's any real risk of being invaded in the next 2 years or so, but they believe there are scenarii which make such an outcome more likely in the long term, that Ukraine's fate might be tied to their own, and that they should do what can be done now to prevent them from being realized.\n\nSo I'd say there's a mix of people thinking it's actually likely and people using it as a rhetorical device, either to push for a change of stance vis-a-vis Ukraine and Russia or for sustained support to Ukraine.",
