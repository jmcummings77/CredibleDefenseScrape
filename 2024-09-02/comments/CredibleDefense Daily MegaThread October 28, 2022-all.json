As things stand Kadyrov nor Putin would turn on the other because they both benefit from this arrangement. However that does not mean that they have loyalty or trust. Kadyrov has made sure that Putin needs him to control Chechnya and prevented any centralized control over Chechnya that might threaten that. Putin provides the money that Kadyrov needs to buy power and loyalty for him and his clan. However if Putin wanted to directly attack Kadyrov, or try to replace him, he has no power base in Chechnya from which to do so, and the clan system would ensure that killing Kadyrov would mean that Chechnya would break away from Russia (and hence likely forced to go to war if Russia wanted to prevent it). Finally I wouldn't put a lot of stock into what people say - it costs nothing to kiss a bit of ass, pay attention to what people do.

Starve Russia of money? Men? Equipment?\n\nIf so, what will Russia run out of first?\n\nMONEY\n\nRussia's bank unfrozen bank reserves are at least $200-250B, though they may be lying. The burn rate is a big question mark since a lot of Russian GDP is based off commodities with price volatility, but let's say they can go 2 years before hitting zero.\n\nI think well before 2 years, Russia would use austerity measures: seize assets of out-of-favor oligarchs, renege on paying full pensions and death payments to soldiers' families, and so on.  So Russia might be able to drag things out far longer than 2 years.\n\nEQUIPMENT\n\nIt's easier to defend than attack, so Russia could dig in and drastically lower their burn rate of equipment. They are also apparently smuggling or buying enough supplies to be able to do things like create more artillery shells, missiles, etc.  It's not clear to me if there is any way to destroy Russia's ability to build more shells/rockets/drones to attack Ukraine from afar, short of attacking Russian factories deep in Russia, which is problematic for obvious reasons. The war won't truly end so long as Russia keeps terrorizing Ukraine so much that people and investors don't want to be in Ukraine.\n\nMEN\n\nOK so how about men? How many men have to die before the Russian economy collapses to the point where Putin cannot spitefully lob drones/missiles/artillery at Ukrainian cities?  I've heard estimates of 25 million men Russia could theoretically draft.  This seems to check out based on some crude math I did using Russian demographics, with fudge factors for how hundreds of thousands of men already fled, millions are probably too physically/mentally unfit to fight, or are under age 18 or above age 55.  Russia can hire some amount of foreign fighters but probably not in the millions.\n\nBut SOMEONE has to run oil rigs, mines, farms, etc. and it seems impractical to train women to do it all while all the men die.  Ditto the security state, which is heavily male.  So I think long before losing 25 million men, you'd have a collapse of the state.\n\nTherefore, how many men can Russia lose before the war MUST end, regardless of Putin's stubbornness?  Call that number X.\n\nIt seems like we're a long way off from X, if Russia hasn't suffered too much from conscripting 300k men and losing hundreds of thousands more who fled and probably 100k+ killed in action, wounded, or missing/surrendered. Yes, losing perhaps 1 million men in 2022 will hurt them in the long run, but the long run does Ukraine no good right now.\n\nSo what's X? It's greater than 1 million but less than 25 million. Any guesses? (I guess X could be higher if Russia drafted women for all non-front-line duties to prolong the war as long as possible, but given Russian culture and Putin I don't see that happening.)\n\nAny overall guesses as to what Russia will run out of first, to finally bring an end to the war?",

Maybe not so much on Putin&#39;s own willpower, but certainly on the general populace, on the military, on the high-level political elite that keep putin in power, on ethic minorities who aren&#39;t pleased to be part of Russia to begin with, etc. They are the ones who suffer the attrition of men, material, and money. </p>\n\n<p>Of all the cogs in the Russian war machine, the ones made of human will are the most brittle by far.</p>\n</div>",

Sure Russia could call up more men, millions probably, but these aren't medieval times anymore where you could equip an untrained peasant with a spear and helmet and have a halfway competent fighter to point at the enemy. Confused, poorly armed and poorly motivated infantry without communications, air or artillery support and armor don't stand any chance facing a determined, well-informed, well-equipped army that *is* capable (to some degree) of combined-arms operations. The 'speed bump' and 'meat grinder' metaphors are apt. At some point Russia's mobiks are no longer an asset on the battlefield but instead form a liability, since poorly motivated troops who know they are being sent on pointless suicide missions tend to revolt against their commanders. The winter cold will only exacerbate Russia's lack of material and fuel supply. I don't see their domestic production ramping up sufficiently to sustain their fires either, even with some smuggling to evade sanctions. It's not just ammunition, but also (especially) the artillery tubes that wear out and eventually need to be replaced. What's left then are Iran's loitering munitions and suicide drones, which are scary but fail to make an impact on the militarily situation. \n\nMy personal guesstimate is that Kherson will fall in the next month, followed by Crima before April. In the mean-time Ukraine will receive more AA and EW systems from its partners and will push Russia further out of Ukraine. At that point Putin could choose to turn it into a Korea-style stalemate where they focus on producing cruise missiles to lob at Ukraine from deep inside Russia. And Ukraine can respond in multiple ways, e.g. firing cruise missiles of their own, crossing the border in force or with 'little green men' to sabotage Russian infrastructure. But we have to wonder where Russia's will to fight be at that point. They will have lost perhaps over 200k men, lost Crimea and the Donbass, their army has been humiliated and their economy is in tatters. The pointlessness of continuing the war should be obvious to even the most propaganda-infused Russian. Will Russia's people, army and internal security services show the will to continue Putin's pointless war while their country grinds to a halt due to lack of imported goods (e.g. ball bearings), continued sanctions, and lost labor potential (due to emigration and military casualties)? I doubt that.",

Confused, poorly armed and poorly motivated infantry without communications, air or artillery support and armor don&#39;t stand any chance facing a determined, well-informed, well-equipped army that <em>is</em> capable (to some degree) of combined-arms operations. The &#39;speed bump&#39; and &#39;meat grinder&#39; metaphors are apt. At some point Russia&#39;s mobiks are no longer an asset on the battlefield but instead form a liability, since poorly motivated troops who know they are being sent on pointless suicide missions tend to revolt against their commanders. The winter cold will only exacerbate Russia&#39;s lack of material and fuel supply. I don&#39;t see their domestic production ramping up sufficiently to sustain their fires either, even with some smuggling to evade sanctions. It&#39;s not just ammunition, but also (especially) the artillery tubes that wear out and eventually need to be replaced. What&#39;s left then are Iran&#39;s loitering munitions and suicide drones, which are scary but fail to make an impact on the militarily situation. </p>\n\n<p>My personal guesstimate is that Kherson will fall in the next month, followed by Crima before April. In the mean-time Ukraine will receive more AA and EW systems from its partners and will push Russia further out of Ukraine. At that point Putin could choose to turn it into a Korea-style stalemate where they focus on producing cruise missiles to lob at Ukraine from deep inside Russia. And Ukraine can respond in multiple ways, e.g. firing cruise missiles of their own, crossing the border in force or with &#39;little green men&#39; to sabotage Russian infrastructure. But we have to wonder where Russia&#39;s will to fight be at that point. They will have lost perhaps over 200k men, lost Crimea and the Donbass, their army has been humiliated and their economy is in tatters. The pointlessness of continuing the war should be obvious to even the most propaganda-infused Russian. Will Russia&#39;s people, army and internal security services show the will to continue Putin&#39;s pointless war while their country grinds to a halt due to lack of imported goods (e.g. ball bearings), continued sanctions, and lost labor potential (due to emigration and military casualties)? I doubt that.</p>\n</div>",

It's unlikely that terror bombing Russians will make Russians surrender any more than terror bombing Ukrainians will make Ukrainians surrender. Less likely in fact, since the Russian government is less responsive to the people than the Ukrainian government.\n\nBetter responses seem to me to be reinforcing Ukraine's AA defenses until Shaheds no longer work, which is the primary tactic that the west appears to be employing right now. For what it's worth I'm personally a fan of putting machine guns on a bunch of crop dusters, they can skim below radar range and if a Russian missile somehow targets them they'll probably cost less than the missile. Seems to me that anything with performance similar to a WW2 fighter would be great at this sort of stuff, and could operate quite safely defending cities far from the front line.\n\nIf that's insufficient, the second solution is ending the war faster, by increasing military aid to Ukraine, or even sending troops to go fight the Russians. (But that would increase the risk the conflict goes nuclear! Probably, but it's not clear to me that it would be more likely to do that than terror bombing substantial sections of Russia.)\n\nIn contrast to these options, terror bombing Russian civilians doesn't send the war any faster (because Russia is unlikely to surrender because of it and it may even lead to more support for the war among Russians), and doesn't relieve any of the pressure on the Ukrainian population (because Russia launches these drones from trucks that don't really need a power grid or anything to operate.)",
