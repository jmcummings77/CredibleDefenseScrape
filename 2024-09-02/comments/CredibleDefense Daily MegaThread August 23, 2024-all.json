An aspect that is given very little attention, but it is extremely important in war. Some consider it to be the main factor of war. I will not tell you how many wagons are needed per day for a fighting army, believe me, it is a lot, you can google it. I will draw your attention to something else.\n\n>GV \"Dnepr\", in whose area of \u200b\u200bresponsibility is Energodar, near which for some reason Ukrainian troops suddenly began to concentrate, is the most remote group of troops for supply, and in general part of the front. On the map, for general understanding, I marked the logistics shoulder, as well as the place where the oil depot is burning. I wonder if it had any relation to the supply of troops at the Dnieper? I think there is no need to directly state the conclusions.\n\n>The night before last, the Marinovka airbase near Volgograd was attacked by Ukrainian UAVs. The total damage, which is visible from the available images:\n- Two Su-34s were destroyed (one in a destroyed hangar and the second in the parking lot);\n- One Su-34 was damaged (the third hangar with a hole in the roof);\n- Su-34s in the hangars could have been damaged, as can be seen in the image, they were there after the strike;\n- An open warehouse with ammunition was completely destroyed;\n- The rest of the airfield infrastructure was seriously damaged.\n\n>The strike was carried out by a UAV with a makeshift shrapnel warhead. It looks like the photo shows an example of a downed UAV, and there are also photos of one of the hangars with traces of damage.\n\n>It is interesting that this is one of the few Russian airbases that has at least light canopies for aircraft. Probably, someone will say, well, here we go! But no, these canopies appeared there a long time ago and, as Fighterbomber said, they were paid for by a private anonymous sponsor.\n\n>Even such canopies are better than nothing. At the very least, they complicate reconnaissance, improve the storage conditions of aircraft and the work of technicians, and at least somehow protect. It is quite possible that they have now made \"damaged\" aircraft from \"destroyed\" ones, while others could have been saved. True, they complicate reconnaissance if idiots do not work there, but they do work here. Again, there are photos from the scene on the Internet, taken either by base workers or by the Ministry of Emergency Situations.\n\n>However, we see that Ukraine is adapting to these conditions. Are there canopies? This means that the strike will be carried out by a UAV with shrapnel and air bursts. In addition, it is possible to simply strike the FABs stacked in the open air, next to which they have so conveniently arranged a parking lot. Let me remind you that this is the second such strike in a month; on August 3, a warehouse at the Morozovsk air force was destroyed (https://t. me/artjockey/1157). At least one Su-34 was also destroyed there.\n\n>That is, the third year of the war is gradually ending, Ukraine is armed with attack UAVs with a flight range of thousands of kilometers, its own Neptune missiles with a range of up to 500 km, as well as Western Storm Shadow and ATACMS, which are not yet allowed to strike deep into Russia. However, until now, in fact, no work has been carried out at all in the zone of possible destruction to build full-fledged shelters. And this is not to mention the ammunition depots, which are stored simply in the open air and can be destroyed by a hit from literally anything: a missile, a long-range UAV, an FPV drone, a Mavic with a drop, or even a carelessly thrown cigarette butt.\n\n>This is despite the fact that 2023 was a record year for Russia in terms of housing commissioning in multi-story buildings, almost 52 million square meters. That is, there is no need to tell you that they do not know how to build. They can build \"human anthills\", but they cannot build a reinforced concrete hangar? And there is no need to tell you that it is expensive. The cost of just one Su-34 is 36 million dollars. And at least three of them were destroyed this month and several more were damaged. It was impossible to build anything in 2.5 years, is that a short time? The Crimean Bridge was started to be built in 2016 and finished in 2018. I do not see the point in even trying to invent any excuses, they do not exist.\n\n>And the rubric \"their morals\". In February 2023, Iran (which has not been at war for 2.5 years) went and opened the underground airbase Oghab 44. Take a look at it\n\n\n\nThe dilemma introduced by destruction of \"Conro Trader\" is particularly notable.

There is nothing Putin fears more than crowds of protestors in the streets.\n\nTheir economy is also already suffering from extremely high inflation and fuel shortages would accelerate that, almost certainly kicking off hyperinflation, which would be wildly destructive. I doubt Putin would choose a complete economic collapse instead of retreating from Ukraine, if only because an economic collapse will undermine the war effort anyway so it makes sense to retreat before pushing the civilian economy over the brink.

Most people aren't familiar with this group but they were responsible for the killing of the PM of India Indira Gandhi in 1984 and an [Air India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_India_Flight_182) flight bombing a year later. However if this is proven to be a real attempt after more details are released then it is one of the dumbest things RAW could have done especially after the two previous incidents. Last time I had shared a story that some in the US Congress had blocked the USD 3B sale of MQ-9A drones in light of the events. It finally went through but it was a warning.

However if this is proven to be a real attempt after more details are released then it is one of the dumbest things RAW could have done especially after the two previous incidents.

        "body": "As of the time of writing, the British Armed Forces are experiencing one of arguably their worst capability dips in post WW2, to the point that many commentators and analysts are suggesting that not only is the UK under-equipped and understaffed to fight with and support its allies, but to defend its own territory and interests against a power like China or Russia. Huge cuts, poor recruitment and a broken procurement system have crippled the UK armed forces, and it is conceivable that the only things keeping the UK armed forces relevant are its partnership with NATO, its technological capability to design (not procure) new systems and its nuclear deterrent,  which is experiencing a confidence dip from the general public itself following two failed test firings.\n\nConsidering all of this, I would ask what needs to occur for the British armed forces to re-achieve its Cold War potency, and to once again become a credible military power in Europe. I have heard some suggestions that the UK may choose not to pursue a military in the style of the USA, capable of performing in all three major domains of air, sea and land to equal measure, but instead choose to focus on certain aspects (for example, establishing a larger and more powerful expeditionary navy and air force whilst preserving its army in its smaller state). I have also seen some more radical suggestions about scrapping the nuclear deterrent and using the budget gained from that to strengthen the conventional forces, though I also question whether the UK military's issues may not stem totally from budgetary deficiencies and more from a recruitment crisis. \n\nIn short, how does the United Kingdom begin to fix its ailing military, and is there hope for the future of the UK armed forces?",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>As of the time of writing, the British Armed Forces are experiencing one of arguably their worst capability dips in post WW2, to the point that many commentators and analysts are suggesting that not only is the UK under-equipped and understaffed to fight with and support its allies, but to defend its own territory and interests against a power like China or Russia. Huge cuts, poor recruitment and a broken procurement system have crippled the UK armed forces, and it is conceivable that the only things keeping the UK armed forces relevant are its partnership with NATO, its technological capability to design (not procure) new systems and its nuclear deterrent,  which is experiencing a confidence dip from the general public itself following two failed test firings.</p>\n\n<p>Considering all of this, I would ask what needs to occur for the British armed forces to re-achieve its Cold War potency, and to once again become a credible military power in Europe.

It's certainly a big part of the equation if we can rely on numbers shot down reported by Russia, but can we rely on those figures?

This is especially true for the claim that \"the front is crumbling and Russia is pushing forward.\" I ask anyone to look at the map at deepstate and select a date maybe a year ago in the Avdiivka region.. In this time, Russia has managed to advance about 40 km on a front that is maybe ten to twenty kilometers wide, so a total of maybe 400 - 800 km2. Again, this is the total advance in a year.

As you noted, Russia absolutely can and does make battlefield advances, but only by applying their vast advantage in fires, equipment, and manpower on a small section of the front in set piece battles. And even then, these advances are slow, plodding offensives that annihilate everything in their path, and cost the Russians a tremendous amount of men and materiel to accomplish. I think it's also worth noting that in order to achieve the necessary advantages in men and materiel on the Pokrovsk front, Russian forces were hollowed out along their long border with Ukraine leaving it wide open to exactly what's happening today. \n\nThat being said, Ukraine has no effective counter to these Russian advances. They inflict heavy losses on Russian units, but are forced to cede ground, and they also tend to suffer heavy losses in the process. Hence why there's some debate about the Kursk operation. Ukraine is desperate for men to hold the line near Pokrovsk, and several of the units involved in Kursk were actually pulled from this very line. But is it a more valuable use of these men to *slow* (not stop) the Russian advance near Pokrovsk, or to capture vast swathes of Russian soil, hundreds (or more?) Russian POWs, and inflict heavy losses on Russian formations inside Russia itself? As Kofman says, that is contingent on what results the Kursk operation achieves and what it costs the Ukrainians in the process. If nothing else, I expect that over the medium to long term it will force Russia to allocate more resources to defending their borders, something Ukraine has been forced to do the entire war, which will further reduce what's available to Russia inside Ukraine itself.",

The question is whether it will be remotely worth doing in reality. Skip to the end if you already know that's not super likely.\n\nIn defense of doing this work at all: Starship is a wholly remarkable vehicle. Falcon has been *landing* for 8 or 9 years and still has no peer. Given a complete monopoly on abundant, prompt, cheap, rocket launch and landing which will be unique to the US for the foreseeable future, you'd be mad not to at least look into possible uses. Will it deliver some game changing capability? It's hard to see it.\n\nThe work has been going on for some time (since before Starship left the drawing board) and it's never been clear (to me) what it might ever look like in practice. Hard to imagine launching a huge ballistic missile at some hostile nation at a time of high tension, or even peacetime, without causing yourself a lot of problems.\n\nIf you decide you're cool with doing that, then the most plausible scenario has always seemed (to me) to be dropping pallets out of a Starship which only ever flies *near* the destination, carries on past to land somewhere friendly. It can lower its ~~orbit~~ trajectory as needed to make the delivery easier, then raise it again to take itself on to somewhere safe. Some kind of reentry vehicle/casing to take the pallets down to wherever asked for the hyper-express delivery. Whether the airforce currently imagines that to look like a blunt glider lifting body type thing, or more like a capsule, or whether the ship has shed enough speed that they can just fall with parachutes, or something else, I've no idea.\n\nAs of [FY2025](https://www.saffm.hq.af.mil/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=D266mM0zhFg%3d&portalid) the air force still say they're also investigating landing the entire ship in an austere environment (pg 283-4). What kind of surface, how dangerous is the exhaust and flying debris to people nearby, how easy is it to spot and shoot down, etc. And of course the [artwork](https://afresearchlab.com/technology/successstories/rocket-cargo-for-agile-global-logistics/) can never resist having some gleaming 50s rocketship landing in an austere environment. They've said something similar for some years now iirc.\n\nWhile a Starship upper stage *can* land on any reasonably sturdy surface, it's not clear (to me) whether it can do so with much useful cargo *and* enough fuel to take off again and get itself somewhere more useful. Filling a rocket with cryogenic fuels is not a job for an austere environment, so I don't know whether the current plan is to just discard those landed ships? Not carry much cargo? Or disassemble them? A disposable suborbital version could be *fairly* cheap (Raptors are said to already be down to ~$500k), but it all seems far fetched.\n\n---\n\nSo. If you have your stuff on pallets, those pallets in reentry vehicles (TBD), those reentry vehicles on a rocket, that rocket taking up a (very large) pad, then your stuff *can* be anywhere in the world very quickly. So long as that airspace is not well defended.\n\nBut what \"stuff\" could possibly be so urgent?\n\n**Excuse my tinfoil for a moment:** is there a chance that between the lines there's an eye on deploying weapons this way in future? After all, we are basically describing a *very* large (100t throw weight), cheap (asterisk), flexible, MIRVed ICBM. [Rapid Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_Dragon_(missile_system\\)) makes perfect sense, after all. Is suborbital rapid dragon honestly a crazier suggestion than orbital-dropping blankets into a humanitarian disaster?",

Or disassemble them? A disposable suborbital version could be <em>fairly</em> cheap (Raptors are said to already be down to ~$500k), but it all seems far fetched.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>So. If you have your stuff on pallets, those pallets in reentry vehicles (TBD), those reentry vehicles on a rocket, that rocket taking up a (very large) pad, then your stuff <em>can</em> be anywhere in the world very quickly. So long as that airspace is not well defended.</p>\n\n<p>But what &quot;stuff&quot; could possibly be so urgent?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Excuse my tinfoil for a moment:</strong> is there a chance that between the lines there&#39;s an eye on deploying weapons this way in future? After all, we are basically describing a <em>very</em> large (100t throw weight), cheap (asterisk), flexible, MIRVed ICBM. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_Dragon_(missile_system)\">Rapid Dragon</a> makes perfect sense, after all. Is suborbital rapid dragon honestly a crazier suggestion than orbital-dropping blankets into a humanitarian disaster?</p>\n</div>",

It's not too late to formulate a victory strategy and appropriately commiting to it. In a year shell production could be ramped up to a point where UA far outstrips Russian production. Less than a year since 07/10 Israel has already stood up an additional 155mm production site, and another one will come on line before the end of the year. 2.5 years into the Russian war on Ukraine, can the same be said about the US and EU? The Israeli economy is but a fleck of dust compared to the economic might of EU-US let alone additional allies (Canada, Australia, Norway, Turkey...).\n\nHell, look at what UA achieved war with it's own drone programs.

Strategically there is nothing special about the Russian declared ad hock war goals. Their purpose is propaganda and they can be altered at will. Let's move past propaganda. Capturing large parts of Ukraine, despite western effort and seemingly commitment is a victory because it promotes the long standing Russian strategy, the take over of Ukraine.

Doesn't mean it can be justified or that I agree with it, but I can't characterize it as irrational. \n\nFirst off, Russia still views itself as a great power whose interests should be taken into consideration and which demands respect. Russia views Eastern Europe and especially the states of the former Soviets Union as its Near Abroad and as an area of strategic interest. They view NATO and EU expansion into these states as an encroachment into its sphere of influence. They hold this view about the former Warsaw Pact countries, and it is only amplified when it comes to the states of the former Soviet Union.\n\nUkraine is of particular importance as it is one of the largest of those ex-Soviet states (smaller by size only than Russia itself and Kazakhstan, and by prewar population smaller only than Russia), it shares a very long border with Russia and has many cultural and historical ties with Russia. Similar languages, many Russian speakers inside Ukraine, shared medieval history, etc. Think of Putin's interview with Tucker. Tucker wanted to ask questions about the war, about negotiations, etc, and for the first part of the interview Putin went on about the Kievan Rus and Tsarist Russia and the shared history between the two states. That is not something unique to Putin or to Russia. If you've lived anywhere in Eastern Europe or the Balkans or have had contact with people from those areas, you would know that this sort of worldview is quite widespread, especially among the older generations. \n\n>Russia does not have much that is worth trading with after any war other than oil and gas supplies. Its simply Bigger Belarus with a finite stock of oil and gas.\n\nCheck my comment below in reply to u/Tricky-Astronaut. Russia had the 10th largest nominal GDP in the world before the war, has 140 million people, it's the largest country in the world in terms of landmass, has vast natural resources besides oil and gas and has its own industrial base. It might not be as a rich or technologically advances as the West or China, but it is not a pushover either.   \n\n\nAfter the outcome of the Great Northern War in 1721, Russia has always been a major player in the geopolitical and diplomatic scene in Europe. Sure, they didn't always get their way and it had some disastrous results in some instances (thinking of the outcome of the Crimean War or WW1), but they were always a significant part of the security and political arhitecture in the European continent, one way or another. To think that this will change after the war in Ukraine finishes is naive and unrealistic, and might lead to further disastrous results.",

Tucker wanted to ask questions about the war, about negotiations, etc, and for the first part of the interview Putin went on about the Kievan Rus and Tsarist Russia and the shared history between the two states. That is not something unique to Putin or to Russia. If you&#39;ve lived anywhere in Eastern Europe or the Balkans or have had contact with people from those areas, you would know that this sort of worldview is quite widespread, especially among the older generations. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Russia does not have much that is worth trading with after any war other than oil and gas supplies. Its simply Bigger Belarus with a finite stock of oil and gas.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Check my comment below in reply to <a href=\"/u/Tricky-Astronaut\">u/Tricky-Astronaut</a>. Russia had the 10th largest nominal GDP in the world before the war, has 140 million people, it&#39;s the largest country in the world in terms of landmass, has vast natural resources besides oil and gas and has its own industrial base. It might not be as a rich or technologically advances as the West or China, but it is not a pushover either.   </p>\n\n<p>After the outcome of the Great Northern War in 1721, Russia has always been a major player in the geopolitical and diplomatic scene in Europe. Sure, they didn&#39;t always get their way and it had some disastrous results in some instances (thinking of the outcome of the Crimean War or WW1), but they were always a significant part of the security and political arhitecture in the European continent, one way or another. To think that this will change after the war in Ukraine finishes is naive and unrealistic, and might lead to further disastrous results.</p>\n</div>",

Mearsheimer is on record as saying that there is absolutely no evidence that current Russia is an imperial state or that Putin is an imperialist, which is solidly in the realm of gaslighting and lying.

Just my opinion, but I think his thoughts are the closest we'll get to understanding what the US foreign policy decisionmakers actually think--just based on his credentials.\n\nA short tldr is that he has a surprisingly 'realist' take on all of this, basically saying that Russia does have some legitimate security concerns and so forth. Much more mirroring the Mearsheimer line than the mainstream narrative. The main takeaway is that no matter what happens, that it is in the interest of USA for relations to stabilize at some point. So that they can cooperate on issues of international terrorism, and so on. He also says that both sides have made mistakes in the past, and that the breakdown of relations is not a onesided affair. That said he gives specific examples where he thinks Russia went haywire in its understanding of events, one is the Beslan school siege; where Putin decided that the west is utilizing terrorism as means of regime change, and other was the Orange revolution in Ukraine(latter the pink and the white revolutions as well).",

His assignments included two tours of duty at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow in the late Soviet period and in the middle of the 1990s, during which he served as head of the political internal unit and acting political counselor. Between tours in Moscow, he worked on Russian and Soviet affairs on the policy planning staff at the U.S. Department of State and as a policy assistant in the office of the undersecretary of defense for policy.\n\nSo you don't know that the Thomas Graham that YOU quoted is a Kissinger acolyte and you don't know that he has been out of government for 20 years. I don't even have a problem with Graham or what he says even if I disagree with parts of it, the problem I have is with you distorting what he's saying. He spent a majority of his time talking about China vis a vis Russia. He calls Putin a thug, a dictator who is trying to resurrect the iron curtain, a two bit bully. You forgot all that huh?",

Read Zbigniew Brzezinski. Or listen to this [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnXaFMFU3v4) \n\nIn any case, there's multiple interests here. One is simply economic, it's better for Ukraine's resources to be available to the West rather than to Russia. Same goes for Russia, they'd rather not be cut off from so many capital inflows. Chevron and Shell were both in talks with Ukraine to build gas infrastructure in Ukraine, 3-4 months before the Maidan Revolution they signed an agreement. It's also not just about economics, from US perspective EU being reliant on Russia is a bad strategic development since--exact same argument that Reagan made in the 80s. \n\nAlso footnote, the first time Ukraine's territorial integrity gets disrupted is not in 2014, it's in 2003. Did anybody in the West make any fuss about it? No, we completely ignored it. So much for standing up for Ukraine. We didn't do anything about it back then because relations with Russia were decent, and Ukraine was almost fully under Russian influence--so why anger Russia for no gain? It's only when Ukraine becomes more favorable towards the West, that we start caring about territorial integrity, rule of law, democracy and so on.\n\n>Sure, if an opportunity such a liberal revolution gets running then they're not going to look a gift horse in its mouth, but at the time Obama famously wanted to pivot to China and even after hostilities with seperatists started, sent no lethal aid. \n\nObama was infamously soft on Russia, or you could say realistic. If he moved in sooner, there would already be war back then. Do you think Ukraine would be able to hold Russia off in 2014? And let's not forget that even in 2022, pretty much nobody predicted how badly Russia would do( I only know of two examples, both of which are Russians).

The most popular measures in developed democracies perhaps get 70-80% support, if it's something politically contentious it's much lower. I think it's absurd to think that Ukraine, which has historically been incredibly split on political, diplomatic, and economic policies, etc. unanimously decided to drop Russia and join the Western fold.\n\nIn terms of actual data we have available, the only thing you can reasonably say is that joining the EU was incredibly popular in western Ukraine(85-95% support), and then goes down(around 30-40%) as you move closer to eastern Ukraine. BUT, and this goes for EU's favor; is that eastern Ukraine's support for EU was higher than the support was for Russia's union(don't remember what it was called), but not by much. \n\nEconomically, it is not absurd for eastern Ukraine to want to join EU; because Ukraine was completely mismanaged and pilfered by all sides since 1991 to now...but it is completely absurd to suggest that eastern Ukraine would have the same support for political/diplomatic measures as western Ukraine. Look at west/east Germany as an analogy, east Germany wanted western reforms just as much as everyone. But the political/social cleavage that exists between the two Germanies is alive and well, and that's with Germany being far more of a historically unified place than Ukraine is.\n\nAnd for what it's worth, while foundations of Yugoslavia's death are mostly internalized and go back to late 70s; the surface level reason that lead to the separation of the federation was Slovenia deciding to implement reforms that would allow it to integrate into European markets(Germany was a big destination), they decided this at the communist conference where republics met; they were rejected by Serbia, and some time after Slovenia declared independence. If you think all these events just happened organically and randomly, you put a lot of trust into democracy, I guess. Shit flows top to bottom most of the time. Before my country joined NATO, there was about 40% support for it; within a year it went up to 60%+. There was no threat that made this happen, I'll let you figure it out what did though.",

Would that particular episode be an example of 'soft', or 'hard' power being utilized? A year or two later, he starts directly and openly talking about the West as orchestrating regime change through color revolutions; once again; were these color revolutions an example of soft or hard power? For my money, if you look at it from the Russian perspective it is quite clear that all of those would represent the same kind of stuff as happened in 2014; thus your point would be moot. The gloves have already come off, if you take the Russian position.\n\n>I struggle to understand how the 1910s are relevant: there were multiple warring governments in both Russia and Ukraine at that time, and some of these fought on one or different sides with each other, with bombing appropriately involved.\n\nUkraine's nationalism that would carry over into WW2 is pretty much born there. So it is quite obviously relevant, if you make nazi accusations; same kinds that were correctly and incorrectly used later on during WW2.\n\n>preferred to keep it within the diplomatic sphere - impossible once you're dealing with open violence.\n\nWhy do you think that is? Putin was on record saying he's not actually bothered by Ukraine being in NATO, funnily enough. You can take that as Putin being pragmatic and being a bootlicker for the West, since Russia was quite weak(2002); but the thing is he makes the same comment in 2005 again--this is after the Orange Revolution, and when Russia has already decided to embark on re-militarization. \n\nHere's the quotes(I can't link, because they go to russian domain; but you should be able to google the text to find the source anyway)\n\nPutin in 2002;\n\n>I am absolutely convinced that Ukraine will not shy away from the processes of expanding interaction with NATO and the Western allies as a whole. Ukraine has its own relations with NATO; there is the Ukraine-NATO Council. At the end of the day the decision [on NATO membership] is to be taken by NATO and Ukraine. It is a matter for those two partners.\n\nPutin in ~2005:\n\n>if NATO wants to expand to take in these countries as members, that, of course, is another question. If you are interested in my view on that question, I am ready to answer \u2026 I do not really understand exactly how \u2026 the expansion of NATO to take in our Baltic neighbours, can bring greater security. If other former Soviet republics want to join NATO, our attitude will remain the same. But I want to stress that we will respect their choice because it is their sovereign right to decide their own defence policy and this will not worsen relations between our countries.\n\n-\n\n>Even if Russia had a plan that it followed afterwards, it's important to note who started the violence.\n\nIt's proof that the justifications that came after are meaningless(this goes for both sides). \n\nRussian POV: eastern Ukrainians are under siege and require our rescue; actual bullshit, both in terms of framing as well as the consequences. Even if you assume every death that occurred being due to \"nazi\" Kyiv regime, and assume 0 Russian involvement; the number we're talking about is perhaps 10-15k people. Is it significant? Of course, but it hardly compares to what comes after Russia gets involved in 2022. The purpose of justifying these things is simply to advance your geopolitical goals more smoothly. The idea that any government acts on things because of ethical or moral considerations is an obvious joke.\n\n>indicate that he'd never been ingratiated with the Kremlin. \n\nSo his work in DPR just coincided with him doing the Kremlin's busywork? That's strange. There's video of him saying early on in the conflict, or maybe it's even before it(I really don't remember now); where he states that \"separatist\" movements will have to be created in Ukraine.

Would that particular episode be an example of &#39;soft&#39;, or &#39;hard&#39; power being utilized? A year or two later, he starts directly and openly talking about the West as orchestrating regime change through color revolutions; once again; were these color revolutions an example of soft or hard power? For my money, if you look at it from the Russian perspective it is quite clear that all of those would represent the same kind of stuff as happened in 2014; thus your point would be moot. The gloves have already come off, if you take the Russian position.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I struggle to understand how the 1910s are relevant: there were multiple warring governments in both Russia and Ukraine at that time, and some of these fought on one or different sides with each other, with bombing appropriately involved.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ukraine&#39;s nationalism that would carry over into WW2 is pretty much born there. So it is quite obviously relevant, if you make nazi accusations; same kinds that were correctly and incorrectly used later on during WW2.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>preferred to keep it within the diplomatic sphere - impossible once you&#39;re dealing with open violence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Why do you think that is? Putin was on record saying he&#39;s not actually bothered by Ukraine being in NATO, funnily enough. You can take that as Putin being pragmatic and being a bootlicker for the West, since Russia was quite weak(2002); but the thing is he makes the same comment in 2005 again--this is after the Orange Revolution, and when Russia has already decided to embark on re-militarization. </p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s the quotes(I can&#39;t link, because they go to russian domain; but you should be able to google the text to find the source anyway)</p>\n\n<p>Putin in 2002;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am absolutely convinced that Ukraine will not shy away from the processes of expanding interaction with NATO and the Western allies as a whole. Ukraine has its own relations with NATO; there is the Ukraine-NATO Council. At the end of the day the decision [on NATO membership] is to be taken by NATO and Ukraine. It is a matter for those two partners.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Putin in ~2005:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>if NATO wants to expand to take in these countries as members, that, of course, is another question. If you are interested in my view on that question, I am ready to answer \u2026 I do not really understand exactly how \u2026 the expansion of NATO to take in our Baltic neighbours, can bring greater security. If other former Soviet republics want to join NATO, our attitude will remain the same. But I want to stress that we will respect their choice because it is their sovereign right to decide their own defence policy and this will not worsen relations between our countries.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2></h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Even if Russia had a plan that it followed afterwards, it&#39;s important to note who started the violence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It&#39;s proof that the justifications that came after are meaningless(this goes for both sides). </p>\n\n<p>Russian POV: eastern Ukrainians are under siege and require our rescue; actual bullshit, both in terms of framing as well as the consequences. Even if you assume every death that occurred being due to &quot;nazi&quot; Kyiv regime, and assume 0 Russian involvement; the number we&#39;re talking about is perhaps 10-15k people. Is it significant? Of course, but it hardly compares to what comes after Russia gets involved in 2022. The purpose of justifying these things is simply to advance your geopolitical goals more smoothly. The idea that any government acts on things because of ethical or moral considerations is an obvious joke.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>indicate that he&#39;d never been ingratiated with the Kremlin. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So his work in DPR just coincided with him doing the Kremlin&#39;s busywork? That&#39;s strange. There&#39;s video of him saying early on in the conflict, or maybe it&#39;s even before it(I really don&#39;t remember now); where he states that &quot;separatist&quot; movements will have to be created in Ukraine. Very much similar to the work he did in Bosnia. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I completely believe that many people in east Ukraine; including ethnic Ukrainians, would be conducive to pursuing aims and goals that were more aligned with Kremlin&#39;s interests rather than Kyiv&#39;s; but if you don&#39;t actually mobilize them to action then it just makes no sense for that to take place, in the way it ostensibly has.

                                                                            "body": ">So how can you say that \"Ukraine is always a part of the US sphere of interest\" and then in the next paragraph basically say that Obama let Putin have his way with Ukraine?\n\nForeign policy is the domain where the US president possibly has the most influence over anything else, but it's still restricted. Proof of this is Trump's presidency. Or, even Obama's. Obama promised a reset and to work towards that goal, I guess it's up to you if he delivered but I'd say that nothing really changed much. I guess we'll see if Trump wins again, buy my theory is that he US president doesn't really have as much power as it is commonly portrayed(even in foreign policy matters). So invoking Brzezinski is not contradictory. \n\nObama was 'soft' on Russia, but he wasn't completely hands off. Ukraine was increasing its cooperation with NATO, for example. Something they had been doing since the early 2000s. Let's say Trump will be even more soft on Ukraine than Obama was, and then contrast that potential policy to the status quo. Do you think in the long view, there is much difference? I don't think anyone would describe the Bush administration as being 'soft', they were after all the administration that started all the middle east disaster wars; so why is it that even Bush was 'soft' on Russia? The response towards Georgia being attacked was to basically back some insurgencies there and send some trainers.\n\n>This is invalid. Being a part of the Russian customs union does not prevent Chevron or Shell to develop the gas fields. War and instability does.\n\nEnergy is the cornerstone of economy, and it is therefore a crucial component of every geopolitical development. For a while I believed that Russia would be fine with Ukraine having Shell/Chevron being in Ukraine, because it was Yanukovych who signed those agreements; and he was of course always presented as a Kremlin puppet. But, he also supported *economic* integration with EU. Were these decisions genuine, or just bluffs? If you think they were genuine, we can easily conclude that this economic expansion would not significantly degrade Russia's influence(since they would have control or cooperation with the Ukrainian government). \n\nConsider also, that EU attempted to find alternative energy sources long before this conflict, Turkmenistan for example had I think the 3rd or 4th largest known gas fields available(before new ones were discovered in Ukraine, that is). So there were serious talks about expanding into that area, this was following the energy disputes that Russia/Ukraine had in like 2002/03(here already, we can see that Ukraine was not fully under Russian control as it is usually portrayed). I think the other country mentioned at the time was Azerbaijan and maybe Georgia. Side note, in this period two pipeline explosions occurred that were deemed to be intentional sabotage, who had the most motive? I'd say Russia, given that EU was trying to expand into those countries. \n\n>Ukraine has no resource that is essential to Europe, Russia does.\n\nHuh? Ukraine has now one of the largest available gas fields on the planet; coincidentally mostly in east Ukraine and north/northeast. Crimea also houses a lot of oil. That's just for energy needs. It also has some of the largest sources of rare earth minerals, and of course anyone controlling their agricultural sector is going to have significant power if utilized for geopolitical aims.\n\n>Losing an island is not the same as losing your 2 most industrially essential provinces.\n\nSo what's your point? Nobody cares about territorial integrity, if you don't eat too much? I guess you're right, since even Crimea ended up being an insignificant bite.\n\n>?\n\nEU and Yanukovych signed an agreement to hold new elections, and some other stuff that would end the protests/violence and so on. I don't recall the details, google it. The day after Yanukovych got ousted and he had to run for his life.\n\n>...For example, we know Trump's associates talked with Russian intelligence..\n\n-\n\n>..But there is nothing about a coup in Ukraine..\n\nThe issue with comparing these two events is that the motivations are mismatched. The Trump example has obvious political implications and motivation to prove there WAS something there; from the position of the status quo establishment. For Ukraine, the same thing applies. There is an *incentive* to not find anything there, because it would obviously go against the narrative. \n\nAlso consider the different media spheres we've involved in, one of those two examples is domestic US politics that much of the world is plugged into; the other is domestic Ukrainian politics..you'd have to be Ukrainian or Russian to really engage with that properly so there's that angle as well.\n\nThe other issue is, how do you define 'coup'? This goes for everyone, including people who think there was a coup in Ukraine. I don't believe there was something akin to a military coup, or that violent protestors significantly or at all changed anything; but in terms of the West supporting pro-Western candidates that would be more favorable to our interests, that definitely happened. Not as a singular event in 2014, like I've said; but in general terms. During the cold war, CIA and other services would have to fund NGOs and promote liberal democratic ideas and values  mostly in secret, today this sort of thing is done completely openly and most people don't even consider it propaganda because they already live in it.

                                                                            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>So how can you say that &quot;Ukraine is always a part of the US sphere of interest&quot; and then in the next paragraph basically say that Obama let Putin have his way with Ukraine?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Foreign policy is the domain where the US president possibly has the most influence over anything else, but it&#39;s still restricted. Proof of this is Trump&#39;s presidency. Or, even Obama&#39;s. Obama promised a reset and to work towards that goal, I guess it&#39;s up to you if he delivered but I&#39;d say that nothing really changed much. I guess we&#39;ll see if Trump wins again, buy my theory is that he US president doesn&#39;t really have as much power as it is commonly portrayed(even in foreign policy matters). So invoking Brzezinski is not contradictory. </p>\n\n<p>Obama was &#39;soft&#39; on Russia, but he wasn&#39;t completely hands off. Ukraine was increasing its cooperation with NATO, for example. Something they had been doing since the early 2000s. Let&#39;s say Trump will be even more soft on Ukraine than Obama was, and then contrast that potential policy to the status quo. Do you think in the long view, there is much difference? I don&#39;t think anyone would describe the Bush administration as being &#39;soft&#39;, they were after all the administration that started all the middle east disaster wars; so why is it that even Bush was &#39;soft&#39; on Russia? The response towards Georgia being attacked was to basically back some insurgencies there and send some trainers.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is invalid. Being a part of the Russian customs union does not prevent Chevron or Shell to develop the gas fields. War and instability does.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Energy is the cornerstone of economy, and it is therefore a crucial component of every geopolitical development. For a while I believed that Russia would be fine with Ukraine having Shell/Chevron being in Ukraine, because it was Yanukovych who signed those agreements; and he was of course always presented as a Kremlin puppet. But, he also supported <em>economic</em> integration with EU. Were these decisions genuine, or just bluffs? If you think they were genuine, we can easily conclude that this economic expansion would not significantly degrade Russia&#39;s influence(since they would have control or cooperation with the Ukrainian government). </p>\n\n<p>Consider also, that EU attempted to find alternative energy sources long before this conflict, Turkmenistan for example had I think the 3rd or 4th largest known gas fields available(before new ones were discovered in Ukraine, that is). So there were serious talks about expanding into that area, this was following the energy disputes that Russia/Ukraine had in like 2002/03(here already, we can see that Ukraine was not fully under Russian control as it is usually portrayed). I think the other country mentioned at the time was Azerbaijan and maybe Georgia. Side note, in this period two pipeline explosions occurred that were deemed to be intentional sabotage, who had the most motive? I&#39;d say Russia, given that EU was trying to expand into those countries. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ukraine has no resource that is essential to Europe, Russia does.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Huh? Ukraine has now one of the largest available gas fields on the planet; coincidentally mostly in east Ukraine and north/northeast. Crimea also houses a lot of oil. That&#39;s just for energy needs. It also has some of the largest sources of rare earth minerals, and of course anyone controlling their agricultural sector is going to have significant power if utilized for geopolitical aims.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Losing an island is not the same as losing your 2 most industrially essential provinces.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So what&#39;s your point? Nobody cares about territorial integrity, if you don&#39;t eat too much? I guess you&#39;re right, since even Crimea ended up being an insignificant bite.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>EU and Yanukovych signed an agreement to hold new elections, and some other stuff that would end the protests/violence and so on. I don&#39;t recall the details, google it. The day after Yanukovych got ousted and he had to run for his life.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>...For example, we know Trump&#39;s associates talked with Russian intelligence..</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2></h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>..But there is nothing about a coup in Ukraine..</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The issue with comparing these two events is that the motivations are mismatched. The Trump example has obvious political implications and motivation to prove there WAS something there; from the position of the status quo establishment. For Ukraine, the same thing applies. There is an <em>incentive</em> to not find anything there, because it would obviously go against the narrative. </p>\n\n<p>Also consider the different media spheres we&#39;ve involved in, one of those two examples is domestic US politics that much of the world is plugged into; the other is domestic Ukrainian politics..you&#39;d have to be Ukrainian or Russian to really engage with that properly so there&#39;s that angle as well.</p>\n\n<p>The other issue is, how do you define &#39;coup&#39;? This goes for everyone, including people who think there was a coup in Ukraine. I don&#39;t believe there was something akin to a military coup, or that violent protestors significantly or at all changed anything; but in terms of the West supporting pro-Western candidates that would be more favorable to our interests, that definitely happened. Not as a singular event in 2014, like I&#39;ve said; but in general terms. During the cold war, CIA and other services would have to fund NGOs and promote liberal democratic ideas and values  mostly in secret, today this sort of thing is done completely openly and most people don&#39;t even consider it propaganda because they already live in it. If you look up US money flows relating to lets say external partners in troubled waters, you&#39;ll find countries like Israel and Egypt being quite high.
