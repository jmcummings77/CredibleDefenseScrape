In 1938 he joined the Reich Ministry of the Interior in Berlin as a civil servant. In 1939 he was drafted as a lieutenant and was sent to the Eastern Front, where he became a Soviet prisoner of war in 1945.[3] Vogel returned from Soviet captivity in 1953. He became a civil servant in the D\u00fcsseldorf Ministry of the Interior in 1954 and retired as a ministerial councillor in 1972.[3]\n\nGreen Party politician[edit ] Source text.\nAfter his retirement, he became an early member of the Green Party, founded in 1980. Already in the founding year of the federal party, he stood as a candidate in the 1980 state election in North Rhine-Westphalia and the 1980 federal election. In an election commercial, he played a grandfather who explains dead fish on the banks of the Rhine to his granddaughter by saying that \"industry has poisoned the Rhine water.\"[4] The Greens failed to enter either parliament; however, Vogel was elected to the state executive of the NRW Greens.\n\nVogel supported demands by the groups Indian Commune Nuremberg and \"Kinderfr\u00fchling Wiesbaden\" to the federal executive of the Greens for the removal of child protection laws and for the legalisation of pederasty.[5][6] On 24 and 25 September 1983, a children's and young people's congress was held at the Emmaus Centre on the Dachsberg in Kamp-Lintfort, which focused on the issue of sex with children. The congress was organised by Vogel.[7][8] According to information from Die Welt and Bayernkurier, this congress was financed by the Green Party Executive Committee of North Rhine-Westphalia.[7][8] In Franz Walter's study on The Greens and paedosexuality, Werner Vogel is erroneously portrayed as \"Wolf Vogel.\"[1] Vogel had already been a member of the Green Party in 1981.\n\nVogel had already given information about his life, including his memberships in the SA and NSDAP, to the NRW state executive at a closed meeting in Altenmelle in 1981. \"As you can already see from my date of birth, I belong to those who have been through all the basic follies of this century,\" he had explained to the other twelve conference participants at the time.[3]\n\nWhen the Greens entered the Bundestag in 1983, Werner Vogel was elected via the state list of North Rhine-Westphalia. He was supposed to have given the opening speech as the old-age president and thus the first speech by a member of the Greens in the German Bundestag. Because some party friends were aware of his sexual preference for children, prominent Greens, among them Lukas Beckmann, the federal secretary, urged Vogel to refrain from giving the speech.[1] In addition, Vogel's Nazi past had now been made public in the main committee of the Greens through an indiscretion. Vogel then announced in the parliamentary group meeting on 14 March 1983 that he would not run for office.[9] Dieter Drabiniok entered the Bundestag as a successor on 29 March 1983. Willy Brandt gave the inaugural speech as the old-age president on that day.[3]\n\nFrom then on, Werner Vogel was only involved at the municipal level. Until 1991, he continued to work part-time as a legal adviser, mainly for foreigners and minorities.",

In a wide-ranging discussion, Juice also shared his thoughts on the prospects of the Ukrainian Air Force finally getting the new fighter aircraft and other weaponry it badly needs.

However, depending on requirements, he\u2019ll sometimes be sent to more distant areas where there is a particular demand for airpower, including the Mykolaiv and Kherson regions in the south of the country.\n\n>As to the status of the MiG-29 fleet, the main issues are logistical and maintenance ones concerned with keeping the jets ready for the fight at locations spread around the country, including alternative airfields. Juice tells us there were no \u201ccritical problems\u201d and that spare parts supplied by allies had been a major help. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s even better stuff than we had before because sometimes it could involve some modernized systems, but unfortunately, of course, we still have some losses.\u201d With the overall fleet of jets decreasing, maintainers and state repair plants are being forced to refurbish increasing numbers of older jets that had long been out of service.\n\n>\u201cAfter the delivery of HARMs, it became a new priority for our air force to maintain and to refurbish more jets for these missions because it really works and it\u2019s really helpful for our joint operations,\u201d Juice says. \u201cAfter that our air force became much more capable.\u201d\n\nNot exactly surprising, but HARMs have been a huge help.\n\n>In fact, the availability of HARM means that the Ukrainian Air Force can even start to emulate Western-style operations, with suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD) packages working closely to escort strike aircraft to their targets. Of course, there are still severe limitations on Ukrainian air combat capabilities, and Juice identifies key missing parts of the puzzle, such as precision-guided air-to-ground munitions, active-radar air-to-air missiles, and advanced fighter radars. \u201cWe are trying to do our best with what we have and now it looks much, much better overall,\u201d Juice notes. In particular, he has observed with interest how Russian military bloggers have reacted to HARM. \u201cThey\u2019re very, very angry there, because of our successes. And especially their civilians who really believed that there was already no Ukrainian Air Force and no air defense at all.\u201d\n\n>\u201cFortunately, we proved that we really, really need these systems and so we have secured NASAMS, IRIS-T, HAWK, Avenger, and Crotale systems.\u201d While NASAMS and IRIS-T SLM have \u201cproved already they are effective,\u201d gaining the Avenger, in particular, is a win for Juice, on account of its flexibility and its ability to down drones like the Shahed, discussed in the first part of this feature. The same goes for the heavy machine guns with thermal imagery sights that the United States approved for Ukraine last month.\n\n>The need for some kind of precision air-to-ground capability has been brought into sharp focus in the battles around the Kherson region. Here, Ukrainian Su-25s have been widely employed firing unguided rockets, with far less effectiveness than could be achieved with a more modern platform with guided weapons.\n\nHmm, guess JDAMs were more needed than I thought.\n\n\n>Nevertheless, the Ukrainian admits that the Russian enemy has become much smarter, learning from its limitations and heavy losses in the first weeks of the campaign. The Russians still maintain round-the-clock combat air patrols (CAPs) with fighter jets, which are supported by A-50 Mainstay airborne early warning and Il-20 Coot-A signals intelligence (SIGINT) aircraft.\n\n>Another concerning new Russian weapon is the very long-range R-37M (AA-13 Axehead) air-to-air missile, carried by the Su-35S and MiG-31BM Foxhound-C. This weapon wasn\u2019t used in the first months of the war, but appeared during the summer and, in Juice\u2019s words, is \u201cfucking dangerous.\u201d The very long reach of the R-37M \u2014 reportedly 124 miles \u2014 can threaten Ukrainian aircraft even when fired from well within Russian airspace. It seems, however, that the Ukrainians have found means to at least reduce the threat posed by the R-37M. \n\n>Juice does believe that progress is finally being made on a new fighter. \u201cI believe something is happening. It looks like the Pentagon is on the same page as us and they totally understand our needs. But the question of how to provide that is pretty complicated.\u201d\n\n>As to the argument that the Gripen is the best fit, based on its proven ability to operate from austere airstrips, with minimal maintenance support, Juice is not entirely convinced. \u201cI flew from the highway in the MiG-29, my mates flew from highways in the Su-27. It\u2019s not the most important aspect of performance.\u201d Furthermore, while \u201cGripen is good enough, we understand that their own [Swedish] air force needs them, and they don\u2019t have a lot of them.\u201d\n\nOverall, it seems like the Ukrainian air force is in decent shape, obviously they need F-16's eventually.

(See [here](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/12/06/what-secret-russian-state-polling-tells-us-about-support-for-the-war-a79596) for previous reporting on internal polling.) The two polls date to July and November, before the evacuation of Kherson, and they were designed to gauge sentiment among \"radical patriots\", which it divided into five groups.\n\n>* \"Alarmists\" - the audience of the former head of the DPR Ministry of Defense Igor Strelkov.\n>* \"Ultrapatriots\" - the audience of Ramzan Kadyrov, the pro-Russian blogger of Ukrainian origin Yuriy Podolyaka and the so-called military correspondents (Alexander Kots, Dmitry Steshin, Alexander Sladkov and others).\n>* \"Left patriots\" - the audience of socialist Nikolai Platoshkin and journalist Konstantin Semin. In this group, unlike the others, there was a small number of opponents of the war.\n>* \"Traditionalists\" - the audience of blogger Yegor Kholmogorov and anti-vaccination actress Maria Shukshina;\n>* \"Loyalists\" - the viewers of political programs on state television.\n\nThe surveys show that sentiment went from anxious optimism to fear and disillusionment as setbacks mounted.\n\n>Radical patriots became more afraid of the transfer of hostilities to the territory of Russia, and some respondents became so disillusioned with the Russian army that **they were even ready to give up Crimea in order to end the war**. Such sentiments were especially strong among the \"alarmists\" (readers of Igor Strelkov), as well as some right-wing patriots who joined them. Researchers note that in the summer it was the \"alarmists\" who occupied the most radical positions and demanded the capture of all of Ukraine, but by autumn they had become the main alarmists.\n\n>>\"We all understand that he\u2014I do not want to name him\u2014until he achieves his goal, nothing will stop. It will also be next year. He will scare everyone with a nuclear war. It is acceptable for me that there is no war, that everything stops, and that Ukraine is helped to restore everything. Because what they say they will restore and are already restoring, is all a lie. I read and saw that either in Mariupol, or somewhere else, a couple of houses were restored\u2014and there was junk around. It's all lies. For me, it is acceptable that all this was not originally. It is necessary to give these four areas back, but this will not happen. Give it back, that's it.

However, since the conflict, in their opinion, escalated into a war between Russia and the entire West, practically no one believed in the realism of such a scenario. As a result, the effect of \"rallying around the flag\" arose: there was nowhere to retreat, the world would not agree to \"our\" conditions, so we had to go further and win the war at any cost.\n\n>>\"Behind Moscow, we cannot retreat, we cannot stop at four territories, because the rest of the territories will be the same.

Others worried that the West might use nuclear weapons if it saw that Russia was winning and there were no other options.

They developed the culture there. They are the people there. Even when it was part of Ukraine, the pennisula had a special status to respect the fact that it was essentially Russian. \n\nWhy should Ukraine get to evict the people that have been there longer than them, done more things there than them, etc? \n\nIt's not like the Russians displaced Ukrainians when they came to Crimea. It was a Tatar territory that both Ukrainians and Russians removed. \n\n\n\nIt's absurd to believe that they want to be a part of Ukraine. \n\nYou are likely from one of Britain's former colonies like the US or Canada. You don't have a sense of nation state. A nation state is a country that exists not because of similar politics, etc, but because the people of that country are very similar to each other. \n\nThat is why during the Italian wars of unification, republican Italians decided to ally with the monarchists, because they wanted to create Italy more than they wanted to create a democracy. Modern Europe is built off the nation state model.

That includes seeing Ukrainian territory returned to Ukraine, but also recognizing that the Russian claim in Crimea makes sense. Just because Russia does wrong things doesn&#39;t forsake their right to self determination and being Russia as well. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not alone here, the parent comment of this thread is literally about the highest echelons of US government de facto recognizing Russian claims over Crimea; and using that as a basis to not support Ukraine past.</p>\n</div>",

Events like this are part of the social calendar of Washington\u2019s smart set, with hobnobbing diplomats, think tankers, journalists, and US officials. Guests took photos with the Ukrainian ambassador. Even Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley showed up.\n\n> But there was something so overt it led some observers to laugh out loud at the gathering\u2019s invitation.\n\n> The logos of military contractors Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, Pratt & Whitney, and Lockheed Martin were emblazoned on the invitation as the event\u2019s sponsors, below the official Ukrainian emblems and elegant blue script that said the Ukrainian ambassador and defense attach\u00e9 \u201crequest the pleasure of your company.\u201d\n\n> \u201cIt\u2019s really bizarre to me that they would put that on an invitation,\u201d one think tank expert told me. \u201cThe fact that they don\u2019t feel sheepish about it, that\u2019s interesting,\u201d explained an academic. (Both spoke on the condition of anonymity and regularly attend embassy events in Washington.)\n\n> That Ukraine and those US military contractors have a strong relationship isn\u2019t surprising. America\u2019s allies and partners around the world bought some $50 billion in US weapons last year. These four companies produce some of the most high-profile missile defense systems and anti-tank missiles that President Joe Biden has sent to Ukraine since Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded in February.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2022/12/16/23507640/dc-party-invite-military-contractors-money-ukraine-russia-war-us\">https://www.vox.com/world/2022/12/16/23507640/dc-party-invite-military-contractors-money-ukraine-russia-war-us</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This DC party invite shows all the money to be made off the Ukraine war</p>\n\n<p>A Ukrainian Embassy reception, sponsored by America\u2019s biggest weapons makers.</p>\n\n<p>The invitation said the quiet part out loud.</p>\n\n<p>The Ukrainian Embassy hosted a reception last week in honor of the 31st anniversary of the country\u2019s armed services. Events like this are part of the social calendar of Washington\u2019s smart set, with hobnobbing diplomats, think tankers, journalists, and US officials. Guests took photos with the Ukrainian ambassador. Even Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley showed up.</p>\n\n<p>But there was something so overt it led some observers to laugh out loud at the gathering\u2019s invitation.</p>\n\n<p>The logos of military contractors Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, Pratt &amp; Whitney, and Lockheed Martin were emblazoned on the invitation as the event\u2019s sponsors, below the official Ukrainian emblems and elegant blue script that said the Ukrainian ambassador and defense attach\u00e9 \u201crequest the pleasure of your company.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s really bizarre to me that they would put that on an invitation,\u201d one think tank expert told me. \u201cThe fact that they don\u2019t feel sheepish about it, that\u2019s interesting,\u201d explained an academic. (Both spoke on the condition of anonymity and regularly attend embassy events in Washington.)</p>\n\n<p>That Ukraine and those US military contractors have a strong relationship isn\u2019t surprising. America\u2019s allies and partners around the world bought some $50 billion in US weapons last year. These four companies produce some of the most high-profile missile defense systems and anti-tank missiles that President Joe Biden has sent to Ukraine since Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded in February. Neither is it surprising that Ukraine\u2019s government, which says its country has already suffered hundreds of billions of dollars in damage, might not want to deplete its coffers.</p>\n\n<p>But the explicit sponsorship indicates how intimate major military contractors have become with Ukraine, and how much they stand to gain from the war.</p>\n\n<p>The invitation is a clear expression of how the war in Ukraine has been good for business.
