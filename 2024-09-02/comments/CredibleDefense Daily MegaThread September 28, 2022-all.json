They have a range of about 500km or less to meet IRBM treaty limits. \n\n>Will NATO detect the launch?\n\nVery likely. The rocket trail will be detected. But radar tracking would very likely depend on an AWACs over the Black Sea or Romania. \n\n>Will NATO be able to determine with a high degree of certainty that it is a) a nuke\n\nNot by its flight, it will look like the scores of conventional Iskanders that have been launched. But likely other intelligence around how it needs to be used will be flashing giant red warnings for days. The whole military will have to be on the final steps from nuclear war level readiness in case the response gets out of control. \n\n>Does NATO have the ability to intercept it?\n\nNot without deploying Patriot or a similar land based system. An AEGIS kitted Burke would be able to track it from the Black Sea but I do not think they are there other than briefly and even then the phyiscs of an SM-3 intercept would be near impossible. So I can think of no means NATO has unless there is something like an air launched missile off off an F15 or something that is like super secret.",

But likely other intelligence around how it needs to be used will be flashing giant red warnings for days. The whole military will have to be on the final steps from nuclear war level readiness in case the response gets out of control. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Does NATO have the ability to intercept it?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Not without deploying Patriot or a similar land based system. An AEGIS kitted Burke would be able to track it from the Black Sea but I do not think they are there other than briefly and even then the phyiscs of an SM-3 intercept would be near impossible. So I can think of no means NATO has unless there is something like an air launched missile off off an F15 or something that is like super secret.</p>\n</div>",

That's the thing about using a nuclear weapon, it's a signal that they are going to go all out to win this war. They aren't going to use one and then run back with their tail behind their legs because NATO responded. They have factored in and accepted retaliation before they use it. \n\n> A lot of scenarios, including the one you paint, assume only escalation\n\nAnd that's because any use of a nuclear weapon is basically the end of the escalation ladder. There are no more steps to take, and de-escalation is nothing short of defeat and the complete defanging of NATO, non-proliferation, and nuclear taboos. The state that uses a nuclear weapon, despite the risk of an actual doomsday, has already made the decision to ascend the whole escalation ladder and let the chips fall where they may. There is nothing to deter a state that has done this, because they have already actualized nuclear war. And they would not have done this if the threat of nuclear retaliation was sufficient to deter them. So conventional retaliation will certainly not deter them. I don't know for a fact at all but in my estimation the only thing to do is accept that a nuclear conflict has begun and start jockeying for the most advantageous position in the nuclear war that the enemy initiated (vis a vis destroying their fire capabilities, or command and control, or civilian population, etc.)",
                                                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>What are the odds of Russia using a tactical nuke, NATO responding with destruction of much of Russia&#39;s hardware within Ukrainian borders using conventional means, China and India joining sanctions, and Russia subsequently backing down?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Probably close to nil. That&#39;s the thing about using a nuclear weapon, it&#39;s a signal that they are going to go all out to win this war. They aren&#39;t going to use one and then run back with their tail behind their legs because NATO responded. They have factored in and accepted retaliation before they use it. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>A lot of scenarios, including the one you paint, assume only escalation</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And that&#39;s because any use of a nuclear weapon is basically the end of the escalation ladder. There are no more steps to take, and de-escalation is nothing short of defeat and the complete defanging of NATO, non-proliferation, and nuclear taboos. The state that uses a nuclear weapon, despite the risk of an actual doomsday, has already made the decision to ascend the whole escalation ladder and let the chips fall where they may. There is nothing to deter a state that has done this, because they have already actualized nuclear war. And they would not have done this if the threat of nuclear retaliation was sufficient to deter them. So conventional retaliation will certainly not deter them. I don&#39;t know for a fact at all but in my estimation the only thing to do is accept that a nuclear conflict has begun and start jockeying for the most advantageous position in the nuclear war that the enemy initiated (vis a vis destroying their fire capabilities, or command and control, or civilian population, etc.)</p>\n</div>",

And it may be that all my guessing is wrong.\n\nHere is a list of possible actors and possible reasons.  You and anyone else feel free to add any actor you think.\n\nRussia: Putin: prevents anyone who deposes Putin to resume gas exports as fast as possible. Cons: why damage it in the middle the waters of a NATO country? They could easily pull something similar in water closer to Russia and have the same effect.\n\nRussia: Gazprom: now it's a terror attack, they won't be breaking any contract if they don't export. Cons: why damage it in the middle the waters of a NATO country? They could easily pull something similar in water closer to Russia and have the same effect.\n\nRussia: Hard line military: \"look Putin, there is no other way than moving forward\". Cons: why damage it in the middle the waters of a NATO country?

Cons: It would be a terrible blunder for the US if discover.\n\nUSA: prevent any second thoughts when the gas price spikes in winter. Cons: It would be a terrible blunder for the US if discover.\n\nPoland: when this is over and Europe still need the cheap gas, Poland has some pipelines passing through their territory. Cons: terrible for Poland if found out.\n\nGermany (or any EU country): if the prices rise and people start protesting the government can say: heyy, my hands are tied. Suck it in the meantime. Cons: terrible for Germany if found out.\n\nTurkey: look! I can get gas from Azerbaijan (who just secured the Armenia area by beating them again) to Europe. Cons: it will take some time to be ready. All the theory is a bit stretched.\n\nUkraine: well, obvious reasons. Fk Russia! (Big operation if they managed to do so). Cons: European countries won't be happy with the terrorism tactics, specially when they produce an ecological disaster in their own waters.\n\nAlso, when some proof comes out (from any country) be a bit sceptical. Not saying they are not true or real, but countries tend to lie for \"security reasons\" (Saddam's WMD, the Nazi Ucrania, etc)",

They're not Russia level stupid (who were doing even worse) but it was very easy to see how both of them came from the same military cultural history where such choices were so routine as to be considered the norm, where heavy casualties aren't just expected but often celebrated (especially afterwards). \n\n2 was true for those UAF units that remained in OC-W after the war started (which I'm guessing acted as their strategic reserve and as replacements for manpower and equipment), OC-N after the Kyiv retreat, OC-S units guarding Odessa or Mykolaiv after March, all quiet at the operational and strategic level but still requiring some units to guard it against future invasion threat, but calm enough where they would have opportunities to conduct actual battalion or even brigade level training schedules, have access to legit training facilities and resources, plus incentive (these units would know they're getting rotated out as soon as another unit became combat ineffective and couldn't even properly rebuild in their operational rear. Elsewhere in quiet sectors on the front lines (like Zaporizhzhia or Kharkiv and Kherson before the counteroffensives), there would be some time while not on the forward lines, or doing patrols, pulling guard duties, etc, to at least do platoon and maybe even up to battalion level training. Though just because there is time doesn't mean it'll be done (even in the US military, where training is harped on ferociously, conventional units slack off constantly, even at war). However, in OC-E and any other hot sectors (Kharkiv and Kherson after the counteroffensives started), they'd be too busy and preoccupied to do any training for those on the front lines and probably in their operational reserves, who would need to be resting, doing maintenance, etc.\n\n3 was kind of true but also kind of wrong. Untrained or barely trained volunteers were either fed into existing units as replacements especially in OC-E and the Donbas, and TDF brigades were used far more than they should have been. And they might have done it to preserve better units. But there was no secret strategic reserve being built to justify that. The UK and other NATO conducted initial/basic training was done because the UAF were so desperate but unable to do it, and the short training curriculum accounted for that; three weeks even with long hours and less stupid shit is still far too little. \n\nTDF and other postwar volunteers got used extensively because they doubled the UAF force structure. If they didn't use them on the front lines and in the shit until they were well trained they'd have had to be leaner than the Russians. More retreats would have been a must, though that's not as bad as Zelensky and others made it out, as the recent Kharkiv counteroffensive proved, retaking ground doesn't need to be a bloodbath for the attacker. But around this time they'd have ~half a million very well trained troops ready for major offensive ops. The lines around Kherson and Kharkiv would have been the same as of late August, and they'd only have lost a bit more in the Donbas than they actually did (i still think they should have conducted a purposeful fighting retreat out of Luhansk and Donetsk, doing regular counterattacks every time the Russians are unbalanced).",

However, the Speaker of the Federation Council, Valentina Matviyenko, actually refuted this information, saying that the Senators would not gather for extraordinary sessions, but would consider the documents on the \"annexation\" of the territories at the scheduled session on October 4.\n\n> However, the State Duma was indeed preparing to consider the bills on annexation in a hurry, even the state news agencies reported. Later, however, Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin also announced that sessions on the \"annexation\" of Ukrainian territories would be held on October 3 and 4. \n\n> \"Volodin, as always, was ready to run ahead of the locomotive and get ahead of the agenda when there was no clear decision on the dates of the final 'annexation' yet,\" a Meduza source close to the Russian presidential administration (AP) explained. Another source close to the Kremlin corroborated this.\n\n> According to them, Moscow did not hurry with the \"annexation\" of Ukrainian territories, because \"the PR effect of this will be almost zero\" against the background of mobilization. According to the sources, the Kremlin understands that so far Russians have not been convinced that Russia needs these territories in principle.\n\nAnother interesting excerpt that explains the sudden change of tone in Russian propagandists that are publicly scolding the hurried mobilization:\n\n> At the same time, Meduza's sources close to the Kremlin stressed that the authorities still hope to reduce discontent. In particular, for this purpose, they expect to use the usual tools - propaganda speeches. Among other ways, they consider public trials of illegally conscripted citizens and their return home, as well as punishment of military commissars.",

Later, however, Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin also announced that sessions on the &quot;annexation&quot; of Ukrainian territories would be held on October 3 and 4. </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Volodin, as always, was ready to run ahead of the locomotive and get ahead of the agenda when there was no clear decision on the dates of the final &#39;annexation&#39; yet,&quot; a Meduza source close to the Russian presidential administration (AP) explained. Another source close to the Kremlin corroborated this.</p>\n\n<p>According to them, Moscow did not hurry with the &quot;annexation&quot; of Ukrainian territories, because &quot;the PR effect of this will be almost zero&quot; against the background of mobilization. According to the sources, the Kremlin understands that so far Russians have not been convinced that Russia needs these territories in principle.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Another interesting excerpt that explains the sudden change of tone in Russian propagandists that are publicly scolding the hurried mobilization:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>At the same time, Meduza&#39;s sources close to the Kremlin stressed that the authorities still hope to reduce discontent. In particular, for this purpose, they expect to use the usual tools - propaganda speeches. Among other ways, they consider public trials of illegally conscripted citizens and their return home, as well as punishment of military commissars.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

            "body": "This is actually pretty interesting. So *Nezavisimaya Gazeta* is a \"moderate\" newspaper, not at all an opposition newspaper but not completely toothless when it comes to criticizing the government. In the 90s it was the primary newspaper of the Moscow intelligentsia and it is kind of like that still. The owner, Remchukov, is former government advisor from the 00s turned self-appointed editor-in-chief of his paper. He gave an interview at the start of this conflict that was part supportive/part critical of Putin. What makes this curious is that Remchukov said in that interview that, after the conflict started, he had to run every *Nezavisimaya Gazeta* issue past the government to ensure it's approved. So that means that someone in government thought it was good for them to publish this opinion piece or at least did not object. Given that this paper is meant for the consumption of the Moscow liberal(ish) scene, perhaps this is an effort to assuage their concerns a little bit? Might be partly allowed to run because it drives home that Medvedev is an extremist and Putin is a moderate? Notice Putin doesn't get the slam in this at all, just Medevedev and the vague \"The Kremlin\". I don't think this is any big signal from the Putin regime or anything, but the fact that it got printed is indicative that it is sending some sort of message internally they want read (and also externally probably, let's be honest).",

So <em>Nezavisimaya Gazeta</em> is a &quot;moderate&quot; newspaper, not at all an opposition newspaper but not completely toothless when it comes to criticizing the government. In the 90s it was the primary newspaper of the Moscow intelligentsia and it is kind of like that still. The owner, Remchukov, is former government advisor from the 00s turned self-appointed editor-in-chief of his paper. He gave an interview at the start of this conflict that was part supportive/part critical of Putin.

Their small city became the de facto headquarters of Moscow\u2019s regional military administration, a staging post for critical supplies to the frontlines, and a crossroads for rail and road transports that kept the Kremlin\u2019s war machine running.\n\nAnd then, on the crisp, sunny morning of September 10, the blue and yellow flags of Ukraine\u2019s 92nd Mechanised Brigade arrived \u2014 and changed the dynamic of the war.\n\nThe capture of Kupyansk was one of the key prizes of Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive deep into once-occupied Russian territory this month, and a critical blow to Moscow\u2019s ongoing efforts to seize Ukraine\u2019s eastern territories of Donetsk and Luhansk.\n\nHailed by Kyiv as a turning point in the war, the lightning assault demonstrated not only Russia\u2019s brittle defences, vulnerability and low morale, but also the offensive capability of a determined and well-coordinated Ukrainian army, equipped with effective western arms.\n\nExploiting a stretched and tired Russian front that spanned some 1,300km \u2014 roughly the distance from London to Prague \u2014 Ukrainian special forces, tanks and armour sliced through their lines and weak rear resistance, provoking a panicked retreat, and dramatically reducing Putin\u2019s gains from more than seven months of invasion.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/qzyP3wK.png\n\n\u201cThis is a very emotional moment,\u201d said Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, visiting the liberated territory just a few days after his troops had recaptured it. \u201cIt may be possible to temporarily occupy the territories of our state. But it is definitely impossible to occupy our people, the Ukrainian people.\n\n\u201cEarlier, when we looked up, we always looked for the blue sky. Today, when we look up, we are looking for only one thing: the flag of Ukraine,\u201d Zelenskyy added. \u201cAnd it will be so in every Ukrainian city and village. We are moving in only one direction: forward and towards victory.\u201d\n\n[The key stills from the dynamic map are in this album, scroll until you see the HIMARS](https://imgur.com/a/qcUPmqZ)\n\nThe stunning advance may have taken just a few days to execute, but it was months in the making, and relied as much on Ukrainian motivation and guile as it did on western support \u2014 particularly in the form of the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (Himars).\n\nBuilt in the US by Lockheed Martin and first shipped to Ukraine in June, the high-precision, long-range rocket launchers have been the single-most decisive piece of western weaponry since Ukrainian troops prevented Putin\u2019s forces from achieving their target of a swift capture of Kyiv.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/wGqjDIA.png\n\nInitially, Himars were envisaged as a way to hit back against Russian artillery, as Moscow fell back on a centuries-old battle strategy of shelling and bombardment. But they have become integral to a plan of destroying key elements of the Russian defence, such as command centres, ammunition dumps, supply hubs and bridges in preparation for counter-offensive actions.\n\nWith Ukrainian operators trained by western troops, and targets supplied by western intelligence services, they were set to task peppering the Russian rear. In three months, Ukraine\u2019s 16 US-supplied Himars units hit more than 400 targets.\n\n\u201cThe western weapons provision and the western training have been game changing,\u201d said a senior Nato official. \u201cHimars and similar systems that are very precise, very long range and don\u2019t need large salvos . . . are a real shock to the Russian side.\u201d\n\n[Back to the album for a second map](https://imgur.com/a/qcUPmqZ)\n\nThe Ukrainian offensive was so swift and unexpected, and the damage done to their target\u2019s communication systems so great, that Russia\u2019s retreat was chaotic. Weaponry and sensitive technology was discarded in the hurry to fall back, and soldiers, faced with a rapid onslaught and no support from their rear, fled for their lives. In some camps the advancing Ukrainians found meals still set out on canteen tables.\n\nIn purported recordings of phone calls made by Russian soldiers during the retreat, obtained and released by the Ukrainian ministry of defence, speakers detail a collapse in morale, military difficulties and grim predictions of what could lie ahead.\n\n[Phonecall sped up to meet 60s imgur limit](https://i.imgur.com/eKbip5l.mp4)\n\nUnder pressure from nationalist voices condemning the military leadership, and faced with rapidly shrinking territorial gains from more than seven months of war, Putin has doubled down. Just a week after Zelenskyy visited the recaptured region, Putin ordered a rapid mobilisation of hundreds of thousands of men to fight in the war and moved to annex the parts of Ukraine his troops still hold \u2014 two steps he had long tried to avoid that drags Russian society irreversibly into the conflict.\n\n\u201cThe battlefield disintegration and disarray is finally breaking through into the Russian political reality,\u201d said a senior western intelligence official. \u201cMobilisation is something Putin until now has resisted for a long time given the domestic political risk.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Putin threatened Ukraine and its western backers with nuclear weapons should they attack Russian territory, a warning that drastically raises the stakes as the war heads into winter. But Kyiv and its Nato supporters are unbowed.\n\n\u201cZelenskyy has demonstrated to his international partners that Ukraine can not only hold territory, but that it can absolutely evict Russia from territory,\u201d said the senior western intelligence official.\n\nAs Russia scrambles to find, train and send fresh recruits to the front, Ukraine\u2019s army is trying to press home the advantage. Seeking to maintain momentum, its soldiers have already carved out more territory in the north-east, crossing the Oskil in various locations. And in the south, a simultaneous counter-offensive, though far more difficult and bloody, continues to eke out gains and push Russia\u2019s line back towards the critical city of Kherson.\n\n\u201cPutin wants to deter this,\u201d the intelligence official added. \u201cBut the Ukrainians are instead thinking about where else they might try to exploit.\u201d",

In the army of the Kaliningrad special district at the beginning of 2010 there were 811 tanks, 1,239 armored vehicles and armored personnel carriers of various types, 345 artillery and rocket systems.[1]</p>\n\n<p>These are non-trivial forces and possibly the most annoying thorn in NATO side (apart from the alleged nukes there). What would a calculation look for Putin here  regarding whether to commit them to the front or to keep them there? With the demands of this war, it&#39;s possible a significant demilitarization (at least regarding ground forces) of the region has occured/will occur.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "Just wanted to make a quick comment explaining why Ukrainian radio silence is actually important, and it's very useful. \n\nSome people say \"why does radio silence matter if Russians know their own positions?\" \n\nWell, say you have a town with 3 squads in it in a triangle. Squad 1 reports they had to retreat and the town is captured, Squad 2 reports fighting but that they are advancing, and Squad 3 reports no trouble. In this tactical battle, you need to decide whether to tell them to retake all positions, standby, send reinforcements, or retreat. If you're too slow, you risk massive losses. The information you get from the frontline is often confusing, contradictory, and unreliable. If you believe squad 1, you call a retreat (but how far?) if you believe squad 2, you order an advance (with or without help?), and if you believe squad 3, then you might do nothing. \n\nHaving careless soldiers and civilians in the middle of this battle share photos geolocating Ukrainian soldiers taking squad 1 positions, about to encircle squad 2, and halting before squad 3 positions REALLY clarifies the situation for you. \n\nThis was a hypothetical, but here are three historical examples: \n1. Battle of France where German Ghost division and tank units were able to rush through French lines, capturing entire towns, confusing the French. Had the French had even slightly better intel, good chance that they could've stopped the Germans in their initial pushes or broke the incredibly thin German lines. \n\n2. Battle of midway. Multiple times during the battle, false reports and dependency on unreliable information led to critical decisional failures by the Japanese, contributing to their defeat\n\n3. Literally battle of kyiv when the mayor reported the city was encircled about 48 hours into the war. The confusion here is hard to map for how it mattered, but I'm sure 30 years from now we will get some revelations about how Ukrainian forces were diverted to the wrong areas and how that might've led to the Russians pushing further than they might have done otherwise. (Remember when people posted parade flyovers as \"Russian bombing formations?\")\n\nIn short, feeding the fog of war matters.",

The Anfal Genocide Museum in Slemani is a very well-done museum that shows how truly awful it was. That being said, the failure of the KRG to become a successful, prosperous state post-2003 is pretty much entirely at the hands of their own politicians, particularly the Barzani family. Pretty much all international support to Iraq flowed through Erbil over the last 20-odd years, and all that money somehow ended up in Swiss bank accounts and London, Paris, and DC/LA real estate. Combine that money with the natural oil wealth, and their completely unfair percentage of Iraq's oil wealth allocated to them as part of the post-03 constitution, the KRG has had access to enough money to develop the region 20 times over, as well as the political backing to do so. \n\nTheir 2017 referendum was done not to become independent, but to shore up domestic support for the Barzani clique among hardcore nationalists in light of them postponing (yet again) any sort of elections for leadership. Everyone knew it was a sham. They didn't put in any work to negotiate with Iraq or any other neighbors. They didn't try to get support from the US, EU, etc. Everyone told them not to do it.\n\nAdditionally, they decided to include in the independence referendum all the territories not included in the KRG region as part of the post-2003 constitution. This included areas in Ninewa and Kirkuk, as well as small parts of other governorates. These areas were taken by the KDP/PUK Peshmerga forces as part of the vaccuum left by the fall of Mosul/Ninewa to ISIS in 2014, and once taken, the Peshmerga built defensive lines and stayed well behind them for the remainder of the war. Kirkuk wasn't a Kurdish city part of the KRG, never was. They decided to include it in the referendum under no legal authority and at the opposition of the Turkmen and Arab population of the city. After the referendum, the Iraqi Security Forces only acted to reclaim territories considered Iraqi as part of the 2003 constitution (including the border crossings at Faysh Khabur and Erbil/Slemani airports) in partnership with elements of the PUK Peshmerga. They did not enter territory legally considered part of the KRG. The referendum failed not because of some oppressive action by the evil Arab Iraqis, but because it was a sham the whole time and was never intended to actually achieve independence for Kurds.

PUK sort of used to be, but in no way remains that way. They're undoubtedly the \"better\" of the two leading parties, and as a result Slemani is a far nicer city to live in than Erbil, but they're still busy stealing money and killing dissidents.

A tank can be absolutely crucial in that first engagement, where the attackers need to go up against entrenched troops, fixed fortifications, barbed wire etc. The tank has enough armor to overcome the sort of anti-tank firepower that is brought to bear immediately on a front, and it has the ability to immediately direct its own firepower on any strong points encountered, and in an economical way.\n\nMissiles, reconnaissance, and air and armor denial systems cannot perform this function really at all. For example, a drone can be great for locating entrenched troops, and perhaps annoying the hell out of them with grenade drops, but it doesn't solve the issue of actually moving your own troops towards them and forcing them out. Once the troops are out of their trenches retreating however, a drone can track them, show the troops following up the attack where they are, and allow the attack to proceed on alternate routes so that there is no need to engage them. Similarly, anti-tank weapons are very useful for stopping Russian armor from counterattacking when the breakthrough is pushing past the frontline, but during the initial assault there isn't likely to be much opportunity to use them as tanks would not be best employed here by defenders.

The reality was many bde/regt could only muster 1x, which was likely why Russia had done a partial mobilization of \"volunteer\" contract troops in the fall winter to beef up combat units meant to invade Ukraine, as well as why some units padded their numbers with conscripts that were not supposed to be fighting in Ukraine.\n\nThose units who didn't deploy their 3rd battalion before the war did so after the late March strategic defeat, either directly deploying them with whomever they come find to fill them up, or using the remaining personnel as replacements for the already deployed BTGs of their bde/regt. Whatever was still left from those or various training units were likely used to act as cadre for the reserve forces that were created May-August.\n\nMichael Kofman goes into greater detail about this when discussing it on both War on the Rocks and Geopolitics Decanted podcasts.",

The reality was many bde/regt could only muster 1x, which was likely why Russia had done a partial mobilization of &quot;volunteer&quot; contract troops in the fall winter to beef up combat units meant to invade Ukraine, as well as why some units padded their numbers with conscripts that were not supposed to be fighting in Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>Those units who didn&#39;t deploy their 3rd battalion before the war did so after the late March strategic defeat, either directly deploying them with whomever they come find to fill them up, or using the remaining personnel as replacements for the already deployed BTGs of their bde/regt. Whatever was still left from those or various training units were likely used to act as cadre for the reserve forces that were created May-August.</p>\n\n<p>Michael Kofman goes into greater detail about this when discussing it on both War on the Rocks and Geopolitics Decanted podcasts.</p>\n</div>",

Here's why I think it's inaccurate:\n\n1. The limiting factor of artillery shells created by HIMARs is not fixed by adding more tubes to the battle. If you have 20,000 shells a day make it to the front, and anymore get destroyed, then 10,000 guns or 1,000 wouldn't make much difference. We've seen few signs of Russian logistics improving dramatically since HIMARs have been introduced. The low ammo output is actually critical for operations being slow, because as long as Russia cannot have the ammo to punch holes in front lines, you will get Bakhmut style battles.\n\n2. If Russia has 20,000 tubes hypothetically, then you run into the fact that if you expend most of them at the same time, you have much fewer supplies to maintain those pieces over the long term. That is, intensely using 100 pieces with 1000 in reserve will last longer than intensely using 400 pieces with 700 in reserve. This is an over simplification, but to sum it up, the more artillery that is on the field the more are going to be lost to use-related attrition. Mobilization will exhaust Russian equipment reserves to the detriment of current soldiers dependent on those reserves  \n\n3. Mobilization units probably aren't the best shots, and artillery depends on accuracy for the best impact (literally). New conscripts simply aren't going to be nearly as useful, meaning that they might fire a ton of shots, but at an effectiveness ratio of less than 50% compared to experienced crews. This burns through precious Russian equipment reserves without much in return. \n\nI still think in this case it would make sense to expend more artillery now for the potential of breakthroughs, but this is to illustrate that mobilization isn't going to help too much even in the one spot that it might. \nIf conscripts don't do artillery, then they remain light infantry.\nIf conscripts do artillery, then it's going to burn through reserves equipment at much less effective usage\n\nAnd this is generously assuming that Russia would even be able to effectively supply the extra artillery guns.

                    "body": "I think you're attempting to draw conclusions only based on HIMARS and nothing else, and don't have the full picture. \n\nThe HIMARS campaign started in earnest from July onwards targeting tactical and operational level ammo supply points, specifically that were housing artillery shells. \n\nThe Russians had been attacking in the Donbas since mid April, they'd only really made progress in a few areas, almost none in some sectors, and barely active in others. But what happened from July onwards in the Donbas? \n\nThe retreat from Lysychansk occurred, where all UAF forces from Siversk to Bakhmut retreated westwards by 50-70 km away from the Donets defensive line to a new line situated on the high ground to the east of the Siversk-Bakhmut road. However, nothing else shifted besides that part of the line, all the other sectors hadn't really budged. \n\nMost of the Russians who had been facing the Donets river defensive line were east of the Donets when the retreat occurred, it took weeks to pick up and move, which created that whole \"operational pause,\" what wasn't really a pause because the Russians still tried unsuccessfully to \"bum rush\" the new defensive line early on. \n\nThe Avdiivka-Pisky-Mariinka sectors became hot for the first time, despite months of shelling there hadn't been any attacks until roughly the July period. But that wasn't the Russians, that was the L/DNR army corps, with their own arty, supply, organizational, morale, competence issues. Also, those areas were the existing pre-war border and HIGHLY fortified, manned in strength, and from August onwards manned in depth, so regardless of how much the L/DNR fired in terms of arty (which would be less than Russian forces, which they weren't), it is doubtful they'd ever make much progress even if HIMARS wasn't hitting supply depots.\n\nWith regards to the Russian Ground Forces left in the Donbas, they were responsible for the sectors from Izyum to Siversk, with Wagner and the L/DNR responsible for Bakhmut. The Izyum axis hadn't really been moving since early April, not surprising since NW to E of Sloviansk are a ton of waterway obstacles. They were trying to outflank it from the west into the mountainous areas or towards Barvinkove, but that wasn't really working. Then in late July and into early August the Russians shifted almost half their BTGs, mostly their best, out of the Donbas front, specifically from the Izyum area, to reinforce Kherson. Not only did they take their best troops but also their organic artillery too (cannons and multiple rocket launchers). \n\nNorth of Siversk as an axis is out because of the Donets river, but the Russians had been attacking from the east,, but we're talking about a much smaller assault force. Check out [Jomini's August 16 map](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FaUv6-RWYAAQN8u?format=jpg&name=large), the Russians are GROSSLY outnumbered in that sector and yet were still on the attack! Note, UAF units have IDENTICAL numbers of TO&E artillery as the Russians, cannon and rocket, which means the less the Russian units, the less their arty, and the more the Ukrainians, the more their so arty.  The Russians did not have an artillery advantage like in May-June on the Donets river line, I'm seeing 4x Russian battalions versus at least an equal number of Ukraine brigades (each with 4-5x maneuver battalions). \n\nOverall, what was left in Russian sectors in August inwards was very strung out, holding a very extended frontage from Izyum to Siversk, still attacking despite being so strung out they couldn't really defend the area (as we learned in September). The reality was the Ukrainians could probably have switched to the offensive already, but chose not to. \n\nAnd that leaves Bakhmut, where Wagner and L/DNR are doing their thing to take it, with only a few actual Russia BTGs in support. They're still pulverizing the whole area with fires in conjunction with probing attacks and actual assaults, but also that area is HEAVILY defended by the UAF in depth (check out the map again). They're making progress but considering what's opposing them (one of the densest defensive zones in Ukraine, likely outnumber the attackers), progress was guaranteed to be limited.\n\nLessened Russian progress in July-present in the Donbas is easy to explain without HIMARS, which obviously had an effect, but not as big as you think. The simplest reason is the UAF reinforced the front while their overall line shortened, but the Russians weakened it by taking forces away from it to send to Kherson since the end of July. The easiest gains were already exploited by July, there were no more weak areas anymore. And they were outgunned by the UAF.\n\nAnd will remain so until more units arrive, which will include more artillery groups. If they reinforce from other sectors in Ukraine, they weaken them. They don't have much left in Russia, which is why they're mobilizing, to try to get more.",

Also, those areas were the existing pre-war border and HIGHLY fortified, manned in strength, and from August onwards manned in depth, so regardless of how much the L/DNR fired in terms of arty (which would be less than Russian forces, which they weren&#39;t), it is doubtful they&#39;d ever make much progress even if HIMARS wasn&#39;t hitting supply depots.</p>\n\n<p>With regards to the Russian Ground Forces left in the Donbas, they were responsible for the sectors from Izyum to Siversk, with Wagner and the L/DNR responsible for Bakhmut. The Izyum axis hadn&#39;t really been moving since early April, not surprising since NW to E of Sloviansk are a ton of waterway obstacles. They were trying to outflank it from the west into the mountainous areas or towards Barvinkove, but that wasn&#39;t really working. Then in late July and into early August the Russians shifted almost half their BTGs, mostly their best, out of the Donbas front, specifically from the Izyum area, to reinforce Kherson. Not only did they take their best troops but also their organic artillery too (cannons and multiple rocket launchers). </p>\n\n<p>North of Siversk as an axis is out because of the Donets river, but the Russians had been attacking from the east,, but we&#39;re talking about a much smaller assault force. Check out <a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FaUv6-RWYAAQN8u?format=jpg&amp;name=large\">Jomini&#39;s August 16 map</a>, the Russians are GROSSLY outnumbered in that sector and yet were still on the attack! Note, UAF units have IDENTICAL numbers of TO&amp;E artillery as the Russians, cannon and rocket, which means the less the Russian units, the less their arty, and the more the Ukrainians, the more their so arty.  The Russians did not have an artillery advantage like in May-June on the Donets river line, I&#39;m seeing 4x Russian battalions versus at least an equal number of Ukraine brigades (each with 4-5x maneuver battalions). </p>\n\n<p>Overall, what was left in Russian sectors in August inwards was very strung out, holding a very extended frontage from Izyum to Siversk, still attacking despite being so strung out they couldn&#39;t really defend the area (as we learned in September). The reality was the Ukrainians could probably have switched to the offensive already, but chose not to. </p>\n\n<p>And that leaves Bakhmut, where Wagner and L/DNR are doing their thing to take it, with only a few actual Russia BTGs in support. They&#39;re still pulverizing the whole area with fires in conjunction with probing attacks and actual assaults, but also that area is HEAVILY defended by the UAF in depth (check out the map again). They&#39;re making progress but considering what&#39;s opposing them (one of the densest defensive zones in Ukraine, likely outnumber the attackers), progress was guaranteed to be limited.</p>\n\n<p>Lessened Russian progress in July-present in the Donbas is easy to explain without HIMARS, which obviously had an effect, but not as big as you think. The simplest reason is the UAF reinforced the front while their overall line shortened, but the Russians weakened it by taking forces away from it to send to Kherson since the end of July. The easiest gains were already exploited by July, there were no more weak areas anymore. And they were outgunned by the UAF.</p>\n\n<p>And will remain so until more units arrive, which will include more artillery groups. If they reinforce from other sectors in Ukraine, they weaken them. They don&#39;t have much left in Russia, which is why they&#39;re mobilizing, to try to get more.</p>\n</div>",

This is an over simplification, but to sum it up, the more artillery that is on the field the more are going to be lost to use-related attrition. Mobilization will exhaust Russian equipment reserves to the detriment of current soldiers dependent on those reserves\n\nThis is a point I am very curious about.

While individual unit sizes and compositions remain in the hands of the military branches, a lot of stuff is standardised for ease, after lessons learned from WW2. \n\nHere are some things you may already know. Ammunition sizes and magazine types for interoperability. The alphabet codes. Designations for foreign equipment (eg Su-27 family is Flanker, RS-28 missile is Satan II) \n\nBut there\u2019s a *ton* of other stuff too. Fuel compositions. Lubricant standards. Firefighting equipment types. Mine procedures. Characteristics of uniform webbing. Measurements of armour and clothing. Airfield signals and procedures. Sizes and threading of screw heads. Communication protocols. Equipment designation. Radio frequencies. \n\nThe lesson from WW2 was that war is won by, among other things, logistics and communication. Everything should work with everything else from another nation even if they don\u2019t speak the same language. If you need a new screw because the one in your rifle is loose, you should be able to get it from any NATO compliant armoury. If you tell a French soldier a set of codes, then he must understand exactly what you mean even if he can\u2019t speak English. And any NATO nation that uses its own industry or vendors to make products should have a certain level of acceptable quality. If your American aircraft is getting refuelled by a British tanker, it should be able to function as normal. If your French Rafale has to for some reason land on an American carrier, it knows the radio and visual signals to facilitate that. If you ask a German Eurofighter Typhoon pilot to bomb a location, your combat controller should be able to communicate exactly what kind of air strike is needed and where. And so on. \n\nIt\u2019s almost miraculous in a way and often overlooked. It\u2019s a massive effort ensuring this compliance but it\u2019s *necessary*. Imagine the level of international military, political, and bureaucratic cooperation needed for this. This is why coalition forces work. It also enables exercises and training to work seamlessly. Further, it helps domestic quality control because every nation sources from a bunch of vendors. So this ensures your industry isn\u2019t cutting too many corners. \n\nNATO isn\u2019t just a bunch of friends. It\u2019s a fully functioning military in itself which can call upon any and every nation for any and every need, knowing that standards WILL be met. \n\n[Here\u2019s a link to 1000+ standards](https://nso.nato.int/nso/nsdd/main/list-promulg) agreed upon.

If you need a new screw because the one in your rifle is loose, you should be able to get it from any NATO compliant armoury. If you tell a French soldier a set of codes, then he must understand exactly what you mean even if he can\u2019t speak English. And any NATO nation that uses its own industry or vendors to make products should have a certain level of acceptable quality. If your American aircraft is getting refuelled by a British tanker, it should be able to function as normal. If your French Rafale has to for some reason land on an American carrier, it knows the radio and visual signals to facilitate that. If you ask a German Eurofighter Typhoon pilot to bomb a location, your combat controller should be able to communicate exactly what kind of air strike is needed and where. And so on. </p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s almost miraculous in a way and often overlooked. It\u2019s a massive effort ensuring this compliance but it\u2019s <em>necessary</em>. Imagine the level of international military, political, and bureaucratic cooperation needed for this. This is why coalition forces work. It also enables exercises and training to work seamlessly. Further, it helps domestic quality control because every nation sources from a bunch of vendors. So this ensures your industry isn\u2019t cutting too many corners. </p>\n\n<p>NATO isn\u2019t just a bunch of friends. It\u2019s a fully functioning military in itself which can call upon any and every nation for any and every need, knowing that standards WILL be met. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://nso.nato.int/nso/nsdd/main/list-promulg\">Here\u2019s a link to 1000+ standards</a> agreed upon. All classified. Have fun looking at the titles.</p>\n</div>",

This is the single biggest reason why you'd want to have an autoloader. Additional advantages may be in sustained rate of fire (autoloaders dont get tired), and in short burst rate of fire depending on how your system is designed (in the 1950s, for example, revolver autoloaders could crank off four or six rounds in the span of \\~60 sec, but then the autoloader would have to be reloaded in a slower process.) Soviet tanks were generally designed, starting with the T-64, to have an autoloader. This was done to reduce the size and profile of the tank, make it lower, and increase armor protection. It was seen as an advantage for tanks which would frequently be attacking. \n\nBut autoloaders also have many disadvantages. First, they break. Your loader doesnt (or maybe he does, but thats a different issue). So maintenance increases, and there is more chance something is going to go wrong when you really need everything to go right. Moreover, while the maintenance burden on the crew goes up, the number of men available to do the work goes down by one. Autoloaders are thus undesirable from that perspective.  Speaking of things going wrong, old Soviet autoloaders (especially that of the T-72) had a bad tendency to try and load the gunners arm into the breech along with the round. A three man tank is doable, a two man tank no so much. I dont think this is a fundamental problem with autoloaders, but rather with that specific T-72 variant. I've read the T-64 did not have this problem. However, there is a larger point that reducing the internal volume of a tank adds in crew comfort issues, and generally makes the whole job more dangerous and more taxing.

You can have the fourth crewmen following tanks in APCs. That's what the French do. They can rejoin the tanks at laager to do maintenance, sentry duty etc. It also makes a tank company more resilient to crew losses due to sickness, leave, casualties, etc.\n\n> However, there is a larger point that reducing the internal volume of a tank adds in crew comfort issues, and generally makes the whole job more dangerous and more taxing.\n\nSure, ergonomics is important. And removing a crewman gives you the opportunity to make the tank smaller, which has many advantages (e.g. armor for a given weight).

Or at least the entire turret.\n\nAs for why it doesn't have one since the beginning, it's a hard problem to have blowout ammunition storage *and* an autoloader together. The Leclerc was able to do both, but most tanks are one or the other. Soviet tanks keep the ammunition under the crew and don't bother with an armored door to separate the crew from the ammunition. You can see a T-72 autoloader functioning in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HIMhIGoFP4). Any hit on the ammunition will completely obliterate the tank and everyone inside, as we've seen in the war in Ukraine.\n\nBy contrast, [here's a video](https://youtu.be/S4uW5AMWUDs) of the inside of an Abrams turret. An autoloader would need some sort of conveyor or arm to pass ammo from the storage compartment to the gun breech while keeping the armored door open for the minimum amount of time, and that has proved too difficult a task so far.",

        "body": "Some thoughts on the Russian mobilisation in a wider context. I keep reading about the \"unpredictability\" of their reaction, even coming from very reputable sources, but, really, it's hard to imagine a geopolitical development being more predictable than this one.\n\n\\- In mid-March it became clear to everybody that the Russian regular army, supported by the separatists, will not be able to defeat the Ukrainians.\n\n\\- By mid-May it became clear that heavy attrition was taking place on both sides, but the Russians were introducing no meaningful reinforcements. Their frontline was growing thinner and thinner, particularly along the \"calm\" sections of the front.\n\n\\- The trend was such that it was obvious that sooner or later a Ukrainian counteroffensive will find a weak section of the front and collapse it. Unless something was done to change the trend this would continue happening until the final defeat of the Russian invasion.\n\n\\- Admittedly, my prognosis was that Moscow would take two defeats similar to the Kharkiv one before escalating. I thought that, after the first defeat, the politicians would (in the time-honoured tradition) apply a band-aid solution (volunteer battalions) and hope for the best until reality hit them over the head again. This did not happen. Someone high up in the Russian leadership is showing a consistent and worrying tendency to act quickly and bite the bullet (withdrawal from Kyiv, from the Snake Island, mobilisation) before the situation becomes truly desperate.\n\n\\- The good news is that out of the two escalatory/defeat-avoiding paths Moscow decided to take the less radical one. This is not unexpected (hence \"the most predictable development ever\" qualification). For the time being, until the mobilisation is proven to be sufficient or not, I would say that the other path is not on the table.\n\n\\- For the next six months or so I expect the Russian leadership to treat the mobilisation as a cornucopia. States tend to do so once they finally crack open the chest and access the family silver. The 300k wave is just the beginning. Every time there is a crisis or a problem the Kremlin will react to it by reaching into the mobilisation bag and bringing out another few hundred thousand freshly minted soldiers. It's just the inherent logic of the war. Many of the constraints are suddenly gone and the state flexes its muscles.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Some thoughts on the Russian mobilisation in a wider context. I keep reading about the &quot;unpredictability&quot; of their reaction, even coming from very reputable sources, but, really, it&#39;s hard to imagine a geopolitical development being more predictable than this one.</p>\n\n<p>- In mid-March it became clear to everybody that the Russian regular army, supported by the separatists, will not be able to defeat the Ukrainians.</p>\n\n<p>- By mid-May it became clear that heavy attrition was taking place on both sides, but the Russians were introducing no meaningful reinforcements. Their frontline was growing thinner and thinner, particularly along the &quot;calm&quot; sections of the front.</p>\n\n<p>- The trend was such that it was obvious that sooner or later a Ukrainian counteroffensive will find a weak section of the front and collapse it. Unless something was done to change the trend this would continue happening until the final defeat of the Russian invasion.</p>\n\n<p>- Admittedly, my prognosis was that Moscow would take two defeats similar to the Kharkiv one before escalating. I thought that, after the first defeat, the politicians would (in the time-honoured tradition) apply a band-aid solution (volunteer battalions) and hope for the best until reality hit them over the head again. This did not happen. Someone high up in the Russian leadership is showing a consistent and worrying tendency to act quickly and bite the bullet (withdrawal from Kyiv, from the Snake Island, mobilisation) before the situation becomes truly desperate.</p>\n\n<p>- The good news is that out of the two escalatory/defeat-avoiding paths Moscow decided to take the less radical one. This is not unexpected (hence &quot;the most predictable development ever&quot; qualification). For the time being, until the mobilisation is proven to be sufficient or not, I would say that the other path is not on the table.</p>\n\n<p>- For the next six months or so I expect the Russian leadership to treat the mobilisation as a cornucopia. States tend to do so once they finally crack open the chest and access the family silver. The 300k wave is just the beginning. Every time there is a crisis or a problem the Kremlin will react to it by reaching into the mobilisation bag and bringing out another few hundred thousand freshly minted soldiers. It&#39;s just the inherent logic of the war. Many of the constraints are suddenly gone and the state flexes its muscles.
