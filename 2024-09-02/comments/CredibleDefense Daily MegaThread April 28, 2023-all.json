As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

Take a look at some of their long form posts:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/110pmhi/the_nuclear_triad_alternatives_from_the_days_gone\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/1187a26/the_persistence_of_greatpower_politics\n\nBoth examples are the type of submissions we look for. As it is, there's been so few submissions that we're approving posts which the mods from a year ago would've gotten very angry at us over.\n\nSecondly, I'd challenge you as to what exactly Gildeer said here that is a falsehood. Yes, it's perhaps wrong to compare US tech from the 90s to Russian tech today and say they're equally bad, but remember that the US isn't shy about donating their cold war armaments abroad. The javelin 'B' model was also a 90s weapon and almost all have now been sent to Ukraine. So these weapons are still seeing frontline use, and in a discussion one could aptly compare penetrative values of the 148B rocket without the later tandem charge to a 9K11 Fagot. Besides, such a menial comparison is hardly worth a ban over.\n\nLastly, we've already banned another pro Russian user and banning Gildeer would well and truly make us an echo chamber. That user was also frequently reported by this community but was very often a high quality contributor. What got him was 'both sidesing' a UN human rights violation ruling and that was a crossing of the line we couldn't tolerate. So far, Gildeer has toed the line well and he provides a good viewpoint to 'the other side' that shields us from having to venture into the cesspit of r/UkraineRussiaReport so we don't see a reason why he needs to be banned.",

Take a look at some of their long form posts:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/110pmhi/the_nuclear_triad_alternatives_from_the_days_gone\">https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/110pmhi/the_nuclear_triad_alternatives_from_the_days_gone</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/1187a26/the_persistence_of_greatpower_politics\">https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/1187a26/the_persistence_of_greatpower_politics</a></p>\n\n<p>Both examples are the type of submissions we look for. As it is, there&#39;s been so few submissions that we&#39;re approving posts which the mods from a year ago would&#39;ve gotten very angry at us over.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, I&#39;d challenge you as to what exactly Gildeer said here that is a falsehood. Yes, it&#39;s perhaps wrong to compare US tech from the 90s to Russian tech today and say they&#39;re equally bad, but remember that the US isn&#39;t shy about donating their cold war armaments abroad. The javelin &#39;B&#39; model was also a 90s weapon and almost all have now been sent to Ukraine. So these weapons are still seeing frontline use, and in a discussion one could aptly compare penetrative values of the 148B rocket without the later tandem charge to a 9K11 Fagot. Besides, such a menial comparison is hardly worth a ban over.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, we&#39;ve already banned another pro Russian user and banning Gildeer would well and truly make us an echo chamber. That user was also frequently reported by this community but was very often a high quality contributor. What got him was &#39;both sidesing&#39; a UN human rights violation ruling and that was a crossing of the line we couldn&#39;t tolerate. So far, Gildeer has toed the line well and he provides a good viewpoint to &#39;the other side&#39; that shields us from having to venture into the cesspit of <a href=\"/r/UkraineRussiaReport\">r/UkraineRussiaReport</a> so we don&#39;t see a reason why he needs to be banned.</p>\n</div>",

Why can people attack me with ad hominem and face no restrictions as long as they stay within the rules of this subreddit?</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m glad this thread is old; I wouldn&#39;t want to openly criticize your subreddit. However, I often find myself turning to Ukrainarussiareport for content that I know won&#39;t be well received here. Unfortunately, the quality of comments over there is subpar, and are at risk of giving you eye cancer. But there are times when you find some pretty good stuff there that rarely gets discussed here, and if it does, it&#39;s usually months later.</p>\n\n<p>Please don&#39;t bring this up with your mod team; I wouldn&#39;t want unnecessary attention. I just wanted to hear a mod&#39;s perspective on things if you&#39;re kind enough to respond. If not, that&#39;s fine. It&#39;s a job without payment, but at least you&#39;ll get a thank you from me.</p>\n</div>",

Putin of Russia would use nuclear arms in combat for the first time since the American bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. The preparations, mentioned last month in a House hearing and detailed Wednesday by the National Nuclear Security Administration, a federal agency that is part of the Energy Department, seem to constitute the hardest evidence to date that Washington is taking concrete steps to prepare for the worst possible outcomes of the invasion of Ukraine, Europe\u2019s second largest nation.\n> \n> The Nuclear Emergency Support Team, or NEST, a shadowy unit of atomic experts run by the security agency, is working with Ukraine to deploy the radiation sensors, train personnel, monitor data and warn of deadly radiation.\n> \n> In a statement sent to The New York Times in response to a reporter\u2019s question, the agency said the network of atomic sensors was being deployed \u201cthroughout the region\u201d and would have the ability \u201cto characterize the size, location and effects of any nuclear explosion.\u201d Additionally, it said the deployed sensors would deny Russia \u201cany opportunity to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine without attribution.\u201d\n> \n> That statement goes to the fog of nuclear war and how the United States could use the new system to pierce it.\n> \n> In one scenario, Washington could use information gathered by the network to rule out the possibility of misidentifying the attacker who set off a nuclear blast. That might seem like an unnecessary step given the distinctiveness of a mushroom cloud. But if a weapon was delivered by a truck, tank or boat instead of a conspicuous missile with a trackable flight path, figuring out its origins might prove near impossible.  \n> \n> Public knowledge of such defensive planning, nuclear experts say, can deter Moscow by letting it know that Washington can expose what is called a false-flag operation.\n> \n> For instance, Moscow could falsely claim that Kyiv set off a nuclear blast on the battlefield to try to draw the West into deeper war assistance. But in theory, with the sensor network in place, Washington would be able to point to its own nuclear attribution analyses to reveal that Moscow was in fact the attacker.\n> \n> \n> Last fall, Russia, without offering any evidence, claimed repeatedly that Ukraine was planning to explode a bomb designed to spread radioactive material, a so-called dirty bomb. Washington warned that the Kremlin was trying to create a false-flag pretext to escalate the war.\n> \n> The science of nuclear attribution underwent rapid development in the United States after the September 2001 terrorist attacks raised the issue of domestic nuclear terrorism. While the science has secretive aspects, its outlines are publicly known.  \n>   \n> Now, this newly acquired capability is being used on foreign soil in the context of a potential nuclear war or a Russian attack on Ukraine\u2019s 15 nuclear reactors at four power generation sites.\n> \n> \u201cIf a nuclear emergency were to occur in Ukraine, whether a radiation release from a nuclear reactor or a nuclear weapon detonation,\u201d the security agency said in its statement, \u201cscientific analyses would be rapidly provided to U.S. government authorities and decision-making centers in Ukraine and the region to make actionable, technically informed decisions to protect public health and safety.\u201d\n> \n> Nuclear experts say such defensive precautions could face their greatest test in coming weeks as the Ukrainian army launches its spring offensive. China has leaned on Russia to discontinue its nuclear saber rattling and Mr. Putin has not recently invoked a nuclear threat. But Western experts worry that Russia\u2019s battlefield failures are making Mr. Putin, if anything, more dependent on his nuclear arsenal, and they worry that fresh setbacks could increase his willingness to pull the nuclear trigger.\n> \n> The security agency reports to Jennifer M. Granholm, the energy secretary. Last month she told Congress of the general precautions for radiation detection in Ukraine and said the objective of the U.S. assistance was \u201cto make sure that the Ukrainians are safe and not exposed.\u201d She gave few details, however, saying that would require a closed session.\n> \n> The Energy Department and the security agency say they are spending roughly $160 million on the atomic precautions in Ukraine this year, with a similar amount requested for 2024.\n> \n> Jeffrey T.

We've all heard about the so-called \"penal battalions\", but what are those \\*really\\*? Do we have a credible estimate as to what Wagner's total size even is? Are they organized into BTGs like the RuAF? Do they have mechanized capabilities organic to their units or are their mechanized vehicles all \"re-flagged\" Russian vehicles?\n\nHow is Wagner maintaining its African presence? Has it drawn down since the start of the war, or has its presence in Africa always been smaller than it has seemed? Do we have any reliable estimates of how many Wagner troops are/were in Burkina Faso, Sudan, Mozambique, Libya, CAR and other countries? I sort of wonder if since they do just operate with impunity (and brutality) they don't really need that many troops there due to their ability to overpower any rag-tag rebels.\n\nAs for Russia proper, we still see it is somewhat active in Syria. How active is that really? Are they just operating out of the Damascus airport and have a few units of MPs deployed? I suppose Russian aerospace forces have enough aircraft to operate simultaneously in Syria and Ukraine, but I'm always curious about their actual abilities to operate outside of their own borders. Does Russia really have the power to conduct operations in Africa, Syria and Ukraine? Or are they simply not effective in Syria/Africa right now? I'm wondering if merely maintaining their presence there is hard enough. If it were 2015 again I struggle to believe Russia could capably assist Assad and invade Ukraine. They simply don't have the resources, and definitely not the expeditionary resources.",

Do they have mechanized capabilities organic to their units or are their mechanized vehicles all &quot;re-flagged&quot; Russian vehicles?</p>\n\n<p>How is Wagner maintaining its African presence? Has it drawn down since the start of the war, or has its presence in Africa always been smaller than it has seemed? Do we have any reliable estimates of how many Wagner troops are/were in Burkina Faso, Sudan, Mozambique, Libya, CAR and other countries? I sort of wonder if since they do just operate with impunity (and brutality) they don&#39;t really need that many troops there due to their ability to overpower any rag-tag rebels.</p>\n\n<p>As for Russia proper, we still see it is somewhat active in Syria. How active is that really? Are they just operating out of the Damascus airport and have a few units of MPs deployed? I suppose Russian aerospace forces have enough aircraft to operate simultaneously in Syria and Ukraine, but I&#39;m always curious about their actual abilities to operate outside of their own borders. Does Russia really have the power to conduct operations in Africa, Syria and Ukraine? Or are they simply not effective in Syria/Africa right now? I&#39;m wondering if merely maintaining their presence there is hard enough. If it were 2015 again I struggle to believe Russia could capably assist Assad and invade Ukraine. They simply don&#39;t have the resources, and definitely not the expeditionary resources.</p>\n</div>",

Now, you&#39;re here, five comments down, presenting a strawman argument in two consecutive comments, blatantly lying to defend the one example I provided, and being arrogant and rude about it.</p>\n\n<p>Now, you are even making general assumptions about the feelings of other users here, possibly emboldened by the number of upvotes you&#39;ve received.</p>\n\n<p>The sheer fact that I challenged you in the last comemnt to clarify what your position is, and you repsonded with a strawman. Tells as much.</p>\n</div>",
