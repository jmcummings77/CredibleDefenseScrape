Why?\n\nFor the Russians, it was the strategic nightmare following the Kharkiv Sep 2022 counteroffensive. That major defeat undermined the entire Russian strategy up until that point, proving it wasn't just wrong but that it was suicidally wrong to \"stay the course.\" So Russian began a series of reforms that helped stabilize their strategic situation, effectively taking the war more seriously and not automatically assuming the Ukrainians were weak pushovers, and that included building sturdy defenses. And to pull that off, minus a rather weak winter offensive by the MOD and the hugely costly Wagner offensive against Bakhmut that didn't cost the Russian military much themselves, the rest of the time the Russians went on the strategic defense.\n\nDeveloping major defensive fortifications is the anthesis to an offensive focused strategy and spirit, it commits vital resources away from offensive operations. Its why Russia didn't want to do it until Kharkiv, and why Ukraine didn't want to do it until recently. Because in 2023 in particular, they were focusing on offensive operations and the eventual defeat of the Russian army.\n\nIt wasn't until Nov-Dec, well after the UAF 2023 Offensive finally ended (Oct), which was months after it should have ended (July) grinding up much needed manpower, equipment and especially supplies, before the conversation at the political-strategic level could even openly discuss the possibility of shifting to a strategic defensive focus.\n\nAnd look at the fallout. Look what happened between Zelensky and Zaluzhny when the latter mentioned in Nov that the offensive failed, that they were in a stalemated situation, the former disagreed and took it as a clear attack on his authority for even suggesting it openly without approval.\n\nSo it really wasn't until well into December that the shift to defensive mindset started in the UAF. Which was too late for their efforts to help now, especially since this discussion is about fallback positions being developed, not improving front line defensive positions, which is next to impossible in hot sectors.\n\nIf one wants to defend from well made fixed fortifications, they need to be either made in advance and then have the unit occupy them (traditionally right before a war starts, or by retreating into them). Or the area must be VERY quiet, where there are no attacks and little in the way of patrolling, probing/recon in force, or heavy use of recon fires, so defending Infantrymen themselves, combat engineers, and even civilian defense contractors can do it without the serious risk of becoming a casualty in the process. \n\nThat is very likely why the Russians ended up being able to build up around Robotyne and Verbove so much. It was only a few kilometers from the front line, but the lines had been static in that location since mid 2022, the Russians had years to dig in there, with few if any UAF attacks in 2022-23 (the opposing UAF force was a defensive focused strung out TDF brigade), and had the motivation knowing well in advance that the UAF were planning to attack through their location to reach Melitipol (the first indicator was Jul 2022, then nonstop from Dec '22 to Jun '23).",

        "body": "Today the Telegram channel \u201cPoisk_in_UA\u201d (the largest Russian channel for collecting the names of their KIAs/MIAs/POWs) published the report on the number of Russian servicemen identified as KIAs or POWs during the week from February 26 to March 3. The number is an all-time record since reports began on a weekly basis at the end of January 2023. For the first time the number of 1000 Russian servicemen identified (almost all of whom were fallen members of the regular armed forces) was exceeded. I gathered the data into an [Excel chart](https://i.imgur.com/xcucx8F.png).\n\nhttps://t. me/poisk_in_ua/49219\n\nA few notes. The fallen include those killed in action while fighting for PMC Wagner (in orange; both \"professionals\" and convicts) and for the Armed Forces and other minor PMCs (in red; contract soldiers, mobilized, convicts\u2026). The identified POWs (thanks to Ukrainian interviews with them) are shown in light green. The data should not be taken as indicative of the number of actual fatalities in a given week. Obituaries (i.e., the main source, along with graves, for the KIAs) are usually published several weeks after the death, sometimes even months - very rare in the following days. Sometimes a death is made known as much as a year later (usually due to examinations in cemeteries). Such is the case with those who fell in the ranks of PMC Wagner who get published in the last months: even now, every week, one, two, sometimes three dozen fallen Wagnerites are still identified, despite the long temporal distance from the Bakhmut campaign. Often there are backlogs - a large number of inputs that are made known at once. E.g. it may happen that in one day they publish 20 fallen soldiers from the same battalion who may have died over the past months, because perhaps there was an event where the battalion honored the losses and released photos and names of their fallen soldiers, and they were not in the database of this channel. Consequently, the week represents the date when a death is made known and not when the death occurred. Let\u2019s also recall that just a share of the soldiers (however, not a very small one) receive a public obituary and are thus identified. Despite all of this, the number of fatalities remains a decent proxy for finding out, a few weeks later, the trend of KIAs along the front. For example, the increase in fatalities due to the Avdiivka offensive can only be noticed from the first week of November. The number of POWs is relatively negliglibile for the volume of troops involved. Several thousand POWs per year are captured by each side, but then a significant portion are later exchanged and the number of POWs is very small compared to comparable wars in the past, for several reasons. \n\nThe KIAs from D/LPR that are identified are included (although this, for the vast part, influenced the 2022 count, not the one of the last period). The datas don\u2019t include those reported as MIA by their families (usually over 100 per week). When Avdiivka fell, Poisk in UA wrote that it was having serious problems processing the inputs because of a large number of obituaries in their backlog and an equally large number of relatives of missing servicemen contacting the channel to get the notice of their beloved one posted. Only very recently the first substantial amount of obituaries of those killed in the final part of the battle of Avdiivka (the urban clash of the first half of February) are arriving. Mediazona (which adjusts KIAs for their actual date of death, when known) has yet to catch up on the number of deaths for the last month: their latest update was on Feb. 15, and they report that they process between 500 and 600 KIAs per week (up considerably from the summer/autumn). It\u2019s widely possible that during February the Russians may have even exceeded the peak of losses they had between January and February 2023, at the height of the battle of Bakhmut. With one difference, however: at that time up to half of the dead were Wagnerites, mostly convicts (per statistics published by official Wagner sources, 15k of the 22k KIAs of PMC Wagner in Ukraine were convicts). This is no longer the case today: the number of convicts (fighting in Storm-Z/V detachments of the MoD, in this case) out of the total number of Russian troops in Ukraine and also out of the total number of casualties has plummeted since then, and makes up a small minority now. Much of the recruiting potential from jails has been exhausted and in February the contracts (which lasted 6 months) of the last inmates who joined Storm-Z detachments last August expired and they went back home, while today just Storm-V detachments (which contracts aren\u2019t fixed-term) remain active, but the convicts are considerably fewer in number than in the past. Today, it\u2019s largely regular contract soldiers who die (it can be noticed from the analysis of obituaries too). \n\nSome \"napkin math\" now. Net of the caveats I listed above, we might try to estimate the current Russian death toll. A plausible estimate of the number of the KIA/MIAs fighting for the Russian side in these 2 years might be around 135k, so an average of about 190 per day. Looking at the trend and using it as a proxy, my personal estimate is that the number of Russian KIA/MIAs over the last few weeks may have been even 350 per day on average, all along the front. Adding to these the remaining irretrievable losses (wounded who have permanently lost combat capability and POWs) and also the hospitalized wounded who will return to the war but are unavailable in the short-medium term, and decreasing them by those wounded in the past months who are returning to duty today (and assuming, given the growing trend of casualties, that the former of the these two categories is greater than the latter) we could be very close to the number of men that (per Ukrainian intelligence) the Russian Armed Forces manage to recruit each month to fight in Ukraine - namely 30k. Not by chance, the Ukrainian military observer Kovalenko disclosed, that per Ukrainian military intelligence, in February there was a drop in the number of Russian personnel deployed along the front. The drop is small: the number went from 470 to 466k (I publish these datas when Mashovets is the one who releases them, as he also includes all the other numbers, including the vehicles etc). This drop is obviously very small, but it should be noted because it\u2019s the first drop since a very long time: the number of Russian troops had been increasing basically unabated since the \"partial mobilization\u201d. The biggest negative consequence for the Russians is that they may lack the personnel to staff the many new units and formations being created. Mashovets had reported that due to bottlenecks (particularly in equipment), the deadline for the creation of some units has been postponed from Feb. 29 to May 31; some divisions (the 46th and 47th Motorized Divisions of the Southern Military District) have been in the creation stage in Crimea since last summer but they would have created only one regiment each (according to Ukrainian sources). \n\nOf course, this doesn\u2019t mean that the current heavy death toll will necessarily remain the same over time, and it\u2019s entirely possible that Russian grouping in Ukraine will return to grow. But the war has taken on a very bloody phase compared to the average of the past two years. Only two periods were comparable to today: as mentioned above, the battles of Bakhmut and Soledar between January and February 2023 and the Russian Donbas offensive in June 2022 (when the overwhelming majority of those who died in the Russian side were D/LPR servicemen). In any case, if the number of Russians signing a contract doesn\u2019t increase (or worse, for them, if it decreases) and/or the number of daily casualties doesn\u2019t decrease, and if the Russians want to go ahead with their plans to raise new formations, we cannot rule out that, not as soon as after the elections, but during the second half of 2024, there may be a new mobilization wave. \n\nIt should be pointed out that the Ukrainians are not only in the same boat, but also in a worse one in this respect. Without trying to figure out the ratio, it\u2019s at least logical that the trend of Ukrainian losses resembles the Russian one, and while the Russians may have difficulty in staffing new units, over the recent months for the Ukrainians hasn\u2019t been easy at all even fully replenishing their losses. As we speak, the intensity of hostilities along the whole front has never been higher. A year ago for example, there was the huge Bakhmut campaign, which absorbed a considerable plurality of the losses on both sides. Then there was also Avdiivka, there had recently been Vuhledar and relevant clashes on the Svatove-Kreminna line. But the rest of the front, compared to today, was quiet. Sectors such as Velyka Novosilka (but also Orikhiv) were covered just by an handful of TDF brigades or protection units of the National Guard, and on the other side there were Russian units often still being restored after Kherson, or mobilized regiments. Several formations of the Western and Central MDs were refitting in Belarus. Clashes in those areas involved a few artillery exchanges and occasional reconnaissance in force; today only in very few areas the situation could be stated to be equally \"quiet\" and most sectors have become hot. The number of men and units deployed compared to a year ago has increased considerably for both sides - battalions on average cover a smaller area compared to the past. This is true for many sectors but particularly in the southern front, along the Dnipro, in Marinka, in Kupyansk. In itself this situation doesn\u2019t benefit the Ukrainians. Ukraine\u2019s challenge during 2024 will be to fix their mobilization system, hope to get a good number of artillery shells from the partners, expanding domestic production of FPV drones, and inflict as many losses as possible on the Russians while minimizing their own.",

In recent weeks, the government has regained control of important areas of Khartoum and Omdurman, its twin city across the Nile.\n\n>The Biden administration has accused both the Sudanese military and the RSF of committing war crimes. The U.S. alleges the RSF also has committed crimes against humanity, including murder, rape and ethnic cleansing in the Darfur region in western Sudan.\n\n>U.N. officials have criticized Sudan for aerial bombing of civilian neighborhoods and depriving Sudanese civilians of desperately needed humanitarian aid.

Here is one interesting quote:\n\n> The Hamas' weapon factories were compartmentalized into purposeful separate production rooms underground.\n \n> As the weapon-building projects became more critical - such as with long-range rockets capable of reaching Haifa - the production rooms were dug deeper underground, to ensure they would remain undetected. Each facility, with its numerous rooms, was scattered within a radius of hundreds of meters beneath a typical residential neighborhood.

Each facility, with its numerous rooms, was scattered within a radius of hundreds of meters beneath a typical residential neighborhood.

A signal comes up on a Ukrainian radar. If it's not positively identified as friendly, by IFF radio beacons or flight plans or basic radio traffic to confirm, then they fire.\n\nConsidering that the Ukrainians have NATO radar and intelligence gathering support, they probably know well ahead of time when Russian sorties are inbound. And considering they have no means to get anything near the front lines due to Russian minor air superiority, the Ukrainians are probably at weapons free status anyway, so as soon as they spot a target they fire,, assuming they have the range. How would they know they make a hit? \n\nThey really don't. At best, the radar signature disappears from their screen. That might be a hit, but it might be the aircraft diving for the deck, using EW to hide, etc. \n\nThat is why RUSI among other credible sources have repeatedly said that Russian and Ukrainian kill claims are not to be trusted, because if they fire at a radar signature and edge signature disappears afterwards, they're classing as a kill. Hence each side thinks they shot down about 100-200% of their opponent's air fleet. \n\nThe more reliable forms of positively identifying a kill would require intelligence gathering. Human intelligence, someone saw the mid air explosion, or saw the crash, and either talked about it. Image intelligence, satellite or long range drones spotted the crash site. Signals intelligence, Intercepted enemy communications were talking about a kill. \n\nMost of that takes days or longer to gather, analyze, and confirm. And many of the above sources cannot be taken alone because they aren't reliable. People lie, especially if it's part of a deception plan, images can be faked, dummies can be used, etc. So often multiple and independent pieces of intelligence are needed to actual lend probability, and even then NOBODY actually trusts this stuff, which is why Military Intelligence is laughed at in the military for being an oxymoron, because they are wrong way more often than they're right.\n\nAnd that's the military side of things.

Neither of those are reliable ways to gather BDA, and worse, they are **very** open to manipulation (much of the info released open source is ONLY done for manipulation purposes). \n\nInstead of chasing stats, look for the effects. \n\nIf the UAF kill claims are true, Russian glide bomb strikes will plummet and the next few weeks will be filled with tweets and news articles describing that from all sides, beyond Ukrainian govt claims.
