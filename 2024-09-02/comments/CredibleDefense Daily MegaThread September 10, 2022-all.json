I think that reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of how these two offensives play off each other\n\nKherson and Kharkiv are two different types of offensive operations, and they complement each other. In Kherson, the Ukrainians are trying to fix a large, well-equipped force in place by denying them transit across the Dnieper, while simultaneously attritioning their forces and interdicting resupply. Because of the density and experience of Russian forces an offensive in Kherson cannot progress rapidly.\n\nHowever the density of Russian commitment and focus in Kherson likely enabled the Kharkiv offensive, by drawing RU forces/focus away from the rest of their lines. The AFU has been able to penetrate so deeply in Kharkiv because the Russians had apparently stripped their lines there. Both are legitimate offensives, but the method, pace and operation of them differ. Neither is necessarily better, to a degree success on one front reinforces the other. \n\nThis is also why we're seeing(saw?) offensive action against Lyman and Izyum from the south, those operations were enabled by *and* reinforce the success of the Kharkiv offensive.

Ukraine needs 100, 200, 500, 1000 artillery tubes!&quot;  That&#39;s not what they need, that&#39;s Russia&#39;s fight and they shouldn&#39;t be fighting Russia&#39;s fight.  We are witnessing the Ukrainian military transition real time to NATO style tactics. They need APCs, IFVs, SAMs, counter battery radars, MRAPs etc.  They are/have trained a huge fighting force and need to be able to deploy them quickly and support them and their GLOCs.</p>\n</div>",

Hold the line on the west of the Oskil river and clean up any remnants in the areas taken west of the Oskil and south of the P07 highway\n2. Hold the line on the west of the Oskil river, clean up taken territories, and a push up to Vov\u2019chansk/Velykyi Burluk/Vilkulvhatka (north of the P07 highway but west of the Oskil) to further secure the northern flank of the new territory and take the rest of Kharkiv oblast to within 5-10km of the border (ending in a similar place in relation to the border as the lines north of Kharkiv city)\n3. Push east from the Oskil to take the east bank only and build an initial defensive line here, short of Svatove, making the Oskil the secondary/fallback line of defence\n4. Push east from the Oskil line in the directions of Svatove (from Kupyansk/Borova/Oskil) and Kremimna (from Lyman/Oskil)\n5. Do one of the above\u2026.. and *also*\u2026.. Open a new front pushing out of the Donbas either North to Lysychansk/Sverodonetsk, East to Luhansk/Donetsk, or South to Melitipol whilst one of the above options maintains pressure in the far North.\n6. Some other possibility I\u2019ve not thought of (Beware Transnitria! We\u2019re coming for you!)\n\nIf asked to bet real money, I\u2019d find it hard to decide between 2 or 4 \u2026 with I guess the decision resting on UAF intelligence on the strength of forces around Svatove and the condition of the remaining UAF units\u2026.. but if pressed I\u2019d go with 4.\n\nMainly because I think the UAF might be sensing an opportunity here to further degrade Ru morale and possibly, if things fell right, force a more general collapse on other fronts similar to the North. Essentially hoping the rot spreads, and other units down the Donbas front (if not perhaps the very best units out in Kherson) start to crumble as morale collapses and doomering takes over the greener Ru forces and DPR/LPR irregulars.\n\nEDIT: It seems given reports since I\u2019ve posted this that the UAF have decided \u201call of them\u201d and are basically mashing all the buttons.

My friend down there has to go through one to get to the closest town with a market, and he's lived there for almost two decades now. He knows most of the officers by name. But yet every time we go through there they have to raise a huge stink like we're secretly El Chapo himself or some shit. And what does all this accomplish? Well, they leave the checkpoints at sunset, so it doesn't do anything at all to prevent trucks full of whatever moving wherever they want at night.\n\nDon't raise your hopes that expanding the military will solve cartels and corruption in Mexico. This isn't a \"just double down on being more aggressive\" sort of problem. It's also not a \"just capture or kill the leaders\" problem either. The entire cartel ecosystem if you want to call it that is now self sustaining in northern Mexico.\n\nEconomic development is one of the few things that is working. The big auto makers have plants in northern Mexico that the cartels are a bit more hands off with (though there's definitely local labor activist suppression and such going on). Part of the cartels power is they suppress more petty unorganized crime while also fulfilling a lot of services that should be done properly by the state. If VW offers a different route to security and prosperity that is an actual threat.\n\nThe big thing I wish were happening was holding the banks accountable. HSBC, Deutsch, and several other similar major global banks have been caught repeatedly, knowingly, laundering billions for the cartels.

Note this doesn\u2019t include the Donbas or Transnistiria (sp).\n\n3. The Russian government is about to lose power because of the war.\n\nA. 1 would clearly satisfy Russia\u2019s state policy for use of nuclear weapons because Crimea is considered Russian land. It\u2019s also the most likely situation. \n\nB. 2. Ukraine isn\u2019t going to go after any other Russian territory. \n\nC. 3. This may satisfy a condition for use of a nuclear weapon because it may threaten the \u201cvery existence of the state.\u201d (Russia\u2019s nuclear weapons policy\u2019s words, not mine). But at this point, it\u2019s not clear that Putin could get the military to agree to use nuclear weapons. \n\nFurther, we know that Russia has PALs on its weapons. What we don\u2019t know is what other safety devices they have, and who controls the codes for those devices. An example: For US Titan II missiles, the President had a launch code. But, the codes to decouple the fueling hoses were solely controlled by the Pentagon. Even if the President ordered a launch, if the decoupling codes weren\u2019t sent along with the launch codes, then the missiles could not launch.

And, in any event, if the regime is about to fall then the military may not be interested in starting a nuclear conflict. \n\nTwo other points. \n\nFirst, I think the initial use of any nuclear weapon would be demonstrative or tactical first. Think a small yield warhead detonating over the Black Sea, maybe hitting a training facility with a low yield device in western Ukraine. It\u2019s unlikely to be a strategic strike, say hitting downtown Kyiv or Lviv with a megaton yield device. \n\nSecond, the unknown for Russia is the US/UK/Fra response (NATO\u2019s nuclear powers, or NNP). Does the NNP retaliate at all? Do they respond with a similar strike against a Russia ally, say by hitting Tartus (Russia\u2019s Med base in Syria) with a similar low yield device? Does the US strike Russia\u2019s Black Sea Fleet conventionally, or maybe hit them someplace else like the Pacific fleet? It\u2019s really hard for Russia to say; they know the White House has a group on the NSC looking at possible responses (public reports), but it\u2019s unlikely they know what, exactly, NNP has for options to retaliate. That\u2019s a major deterrent. \n\nNote: I\u2019m presenting this from Russia\u2019s perspective; Crimea is Ukraine.\n\n(Edit - numbering)",

We know Ukraine had reserves and that they've been creating new units.\n\nThat would suggest that they could heavily reinforce one of the axis of attack (given logistics permit it) or, perhaps, start a 3rd offensive.\n\nWould be quite dangerous (committing your reserves always is) but this seems like the moment to do it. \n\nDo you guys think we'll see 4 to 6 fresh brigades pushing past Kupyansk towards Svatove and Rubizhne? Reinforcing the Kherson salient and going for Nova Kahovka? Or push from the North on, I barely dare to say the name, Berdyansk?",

How many systems have been compromised? \n\nWe have seen all the \"downsides\" of Russian equipment against \"Western/NATO\" equipment and doctrine. Obviously, those flaws will need to be adapted to, either through redesigns (BMP-X perhaps / T-99999 'Armaprototype') that will be designed by Russia through the years.\n\nHowever, redesigning Comms/AD/EW/Locating equipment will take longer obviously. I am assuming that we can probably state any system that has been captured is obsolete in the future and will need to be redesigned/adapted to.\n\nSanctions or none, budgets or none.

They would be used to  to target important Ukrainian infrastructure, logistics or FOB's.  The intention being to shift the advantage on the battlefield back in Russia's favour much the same way that HIMAR's system's & HARM's shifted the momentum from Russia to Ukraine.  \n\nIn all honestly I would not rule out their use in the near future. Russia's other options are quite terrible (from Russia's perspective). These being surrendering or mobilization. Surrendering would go down horribly with the Russian public after all the money and blood Russia has spent. Mobilization of 20 year olds from Russia's middle classes and putting them in T62's would also go down terribly with the public. Realistically surrendering or mobilisation would probably see the end of the current Russian govt in the near future.\n\nHistorically leaders like putin who are cornered like this will chose to go all in as apposed to folding their hand they have committed too much to the hand already.

If Russia goes down this road it would not destroy the planet. They would be used to  to target important Ukrainian infrastructure, logistics or FOB&#39;s.  The intention being to shift the advantage on the battlefield back in Russia&#39;s favour much the same way that HIMAR&#39;s system&#39;s &amp; HARM&#39;s shifted the momentum from Russia to Ukraine.  </p>\n\n<p>In all honestly I would not rule out their use in the near future. Russia&#39;s other options are quite terrible (from Russia&#39;s perspective). These being surrendering or mobilization. Surrendering would go down horribly with the Russian public after all the money and blood Russia has spent. Mobilization of 20 year olds from Russia&#39;s middle classes and putting them in T62&#39;s would also go down terribly with the public. Realistically surrendering or mobilisation would probably see the end of the current Russian govt in the near future.</p>\n\n<p>Historically leaders like putin who are cornered like this will chose to go all in as apposed to folding their hand they have committed too much to the hand already.
