Writing software to get it to behave autonomously - AI - is also challenging, to say the least.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/TankPorn/comments/woxvd1/an_iranian_drone_with_a_small_grenade_launcher_on/\">There is a thread over on /r/tankporn</a>, thing is super cute for having a RPG(28?) mounted on it.</p>\n</div>",

A fighter plane typically wants to have high air speed, but a helicopter wants higher lifting capacity.\n\nFor a propeller plane flying at high subsonic speeds, you will be limited by the speed of the blade tips, so reducing the radius of the propeller is an important consideration. Splitting your large single propeller into two smaller propellers using a planetary gear on the propeller shaft means lower blade tip speeds. For a helicopter, to generate vertical lift efficiently, you want to push a very large mass of air downwards at the lowest possible speeds, so having two rotors that are spaced out, so that each can push a fresh stream of air downwards, is beneficial.

The lines barely moved for months with small incremental advances that only paid off operational because two separate breakthroughs in the S and SE undermined the entire eastern half of the salient. \n\nBreak down the sectors:\n\nThe southern line of the salient from Pisky to Bakhmut has barely moved since April. Interestingly enough, it's the same line of contact that existed  during the Donbas War. It's HIGHLY fortified, no real defense in depth because the intent isn't to retreat from it. That line isn't built on any specific terrain feature, it extended all the way east through Popasna and then to Donets around Nyzhnje. Notably, the above-mentioned Russian breakthroughs that managed to roll up the eastern half of the salient started at Popasna and Nyzhnje. \n\nOriginally, when the Russians invaded, the UAF didn't defend the UA-RU border in that area but fell back to defensive positions on the Donets that ran from Izyum east following the Donets to Nyzhnje where the JFO line connected to it. Again, no defense in depth, that line was supposed to hold. And for the most part it did. But in some places it cracked and that's where Russian progress was made, Popasna and Nyzhnje. In both of those sectors the UAF managed to build make shift lines in depth behind the breakthrough sectors but they couldn't hold, and when those two axes linked up it created the Zolote pocket, and then threatened Lysychansk from the south, causing the withdrawal of the entire Donets river line from Siversk to Bakhmut.\n\nIn March to April, as a shaping operation for the coming Donbas offensive, the Russians performed a successful river crossing and took Izyum, which breached the Donets river defensive line in that sector but there were more waterways NW to E of Sloviansk, so progress on that sector has been extremely limited. Without trying to skirt around Sloviansk from the mountainous areas to the NW to W (which the Russians are trying to do), they can't take or cut off Sloviansk, and if they can't take Sloviansk they definitely can't take Kramatorsk. \n\nFrom Sloviansk to Siversk, the northern half of the salient, most of the UAF line are still defending from the same river obstacles they've defended since the war started. Even the few areas the Russians made some progress (Lyman) there is still a river they need to cross. For any progress to happen there they need to conduct a large scale, brigade or bigger, river crossing against an enemy who have been prepping to defeat those since April. So it's highly unlikely that the Russians will ever make more than incremental progress there. \n\nThe defensive line from Siversk to Bakhmut is another story. Its new, it was only created after the eastern half of the salient was looking like it was going to fall. They have no real major obstacles to defend from except the high ground east of the T0513 highway that the line is based on. The Russians are making progress against it, trying to bypass Siversk from the south and trying to bypass Bakhmut from the north and south. In all likelihood they might be able to penetrate that line and end up cutting off both of those cities but that's not a big deal, because the Sloviansk-Kramatorsk-Kostyantynivka line to the west of it is even stronger. So while the eastern half of the salient is \"vulnerable,\" achieving tactical success won't lead to operational victory (take Donetsk oblast), only the loss of a few more cities that'll be destroyed by the time it happens.\n\nThat leaves the southern part of the salient, the old JFO front line. The Russians had been shelling Avdiivka since the war started but only recently started an attack on it, Pisky, and other places in that sector. Why now? It's vulnerable and if they don't make progress generals get fired. But even if they breach that line, then the UAF just has to fall back to another line behind it. The likelihood of the Russians achieving an operational victory from that direction is nil, it's 100 km from Pisky to Sloviansk, so there will be no major encirclement, just more grinding actions heavy in fires and casualties.\n\nTo conclude, the Donets River-JFO defensive line is still largely intact and holding. The areas where it was breached led to the earlier Russian successes. Further breaches of the new line will only gain the Russians limited tactical advances that won't position them for greater operational achievements. They have almost no chance of taking the Sloviansk-Kramatorsk-Kostyantynivka line.",

The actual areas the Russians have directly broken through seem to have come from a mix of significantly weakened defenders, crumbling defenses, and the town/city losing political value having been basically leveled by artillery fire, where tactical commanders are asking \"Do we still need to defend this place?

In a legit defense in depth, multiple lines should be manned at the same time, that's so a Popasna type breakthrough doesn't happen, where an exhausted defensive force has to retreat back and occupy new positions before the enemy pursues them or launches a fresh echelon to attack, versus just needing to pass through the lines of an alert and ready defending force.\n\nThe issue is that the frontages in this war are so long and the overall force structures so small neither side have the manpower for depth, even in places they concentrate. Especially since both sides aren't doing economy of force and are HIGHLY distracted by supporting operations that are competing for manpower. \n\nMaybe the units holding the front line can do two up/one back but they definitely don't have large numbers of uncommitted forces positioned behind the front lines. If they did, the UAF defenders could regularly rotate units off the front lines nearly every week WW1 style which they aren't doing. The opposite actually, many UAF units are complaining that they aren't ever rotated off anymore, which means they have nobody behind them. Especially Pisky, that was what multiple accounts from troops recently complained about, they're not being given breaks.

Why go through all that work to build them when nobody is allowed to retreat from the first one without presidential approval because strategic policy says losing a village is tantamount to a political defeat? Even allowing troops to build defenses behind the lines in such scenarios has historically been prohibited, it hurts morale with troops thinking they're allowed to retreat. Basically the Hernan Cortes burning of ships version of defending: \"there is no going back, get that idea out of your head.\"\n\nI'm not saying there aren't fallback lines sited and potentially built behind the first, they did have lines behind Popasna and Nyzhnje built, though neither were strong enough to stop attacks.

If that happens the same process will be done to the main line of cities left. </p>\n\n<p>Clearly their offensive has not yet culminated and they have not been forced to strip all offensive capabilities to shore up the southern front yet. I wonder what it will take to get it to stop. Probably most of the firepower that is right now trying to cut off Kherson.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "Seen some comments saying that it's impossible to be churning out thousands of military equipment with the standards we have today. It's the simple truth, there's no way we would be able to employ millions large armies without seeing a major major decrease in the quality of equipment. Tanks, planes, helicopters. Safety mechanisms, optics, stabilization, reactive armor... Even infantry equipment would be heavily lacking in that department.\n\nThat got me thinking - what if countries like Russia or China resorted to actually restarting and churning out cold war-like equipment intended for a land war? It's objectively the best middle-ground between \"utterly useless\" WW2-style vehicles, and the highly sophisticated digitally-controlled equipment of today. The biggest counter to this would be anti-tank or anti-air missiles, and the resulting massive losses would be something to be aware of for the governments. But if it does the job done, from history we know that autocratic governments are willing to tolerate astronomical losses in materiel and personnel. As long as it yields results. The people, depending on how sacrifice is considered in culture and history of that nation, could also tolerate high losses.\n\nThe biggest issue would be, in Russia's case, the industrial bottleneck. Since the break-up of the USSR it was dealt a deathly blow. Even if they would be able to whip up tanks much quicker with their current assembly lines, the lack of a good amount of heavy industries would be probably a major bottleneck. I am not an expert on Chinese industrial capabilities but I don't think the same can be said about China which possibly could churn out a crapton of cold war era land equipment if it decided to, with or without Russia's help. But land warfare isn't what China cares about right now, and since it really relies and is going to rely even more on naval equipment, which definitely in the era of missiles requires at least some kind of sophistication, it's going to have to keep producing high-tech ships. In a land war an old tank can push and threaten unsupported infantry, if the tank itself is well supported. In naval warfare however your cold war era ship could be nothing but a magnet and all that tremendously higher budget in comparison to land equipment, was spent only to be blown up within minutes of active engagement with a superior force.\n\nWhat I am trying to say is that land warfare, if we are not taking air into consideration, is probably the most suitable area of war to produce a major quantity of lackluster \"good-enough\" equipment (tanks, artillery, supported with plentiful infantry), which could help in capturing land, cities and strategic locations. Navy and air however, especially in the case of Russia, are a waste of resources if you are planning only on engaging an opponent that is simply going to outrange you, outgun you and hell even outnumber you. \n\nWith that out of the way, are not all high-intense conflicts near-peer conflicts doomed to the same fate as the Iraq-Iran war was and now Russo-Ukrainian war where both sides become \"spent\"? Where, if you want to make major changes on the battlefield, you simply have to dedicate exorbitant resources in equipment, manpower and ever-increasing budget to make the opponent budge and move the frontline at least by a village or two, let alone a town and god forbid a minor city or a metropolis. \n\nEverywhere across the world manpower and equipment is becoming more and more scarce, major nations are in demographic decline threatened by the changing climate, yet if nations want to achieve results on a high-intensity battlefield they need to be willing to tolerate high losses, especially if they lack in tech, which could be degraded heavily by months long active war.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Seen some comments saying that it&#39;s impossible to be churning out thousands of military equipment with the standards we have today. It&#39;s the simple truth, there&#39;s no way we would be able to employ millions large armies without seeing a major major decrease in the quality of equipment. Tanks, planes, helicopters. Safety mechanisms, optics, stabilization, reactive armor... Even infantry equipment would be heavily lacking in that department.</p>\n\n<p>That got me thinking - what if countries like Russia or China resorted to actually restarting and churning out cold war-like equipment intended for a land war? It&#39;s objectively the best middle-ground between &quot;utterly useless&quot; WW2-style vehicles, and the highly sophisticated digitally-controlled equipment of today. The biggest counter to this would be anti-tank or anti-air missiles, and the resulting massive losses would be something to be aware of for the governments. But if it does the job done, from history we know that autocratic governments are willing to tolerate astronomical losses in materiel and personnel. As long as it yields results. The people, depending on how sacrifice is considered in culture and history of that nation, could also tolerate high losses.</p>\n\n<p>The biggest issue would be, in Russia&#39;s case, the industrial bottleneck. Since the break-up of the USSR it was dealt a deathly blow. Even if they would be able to whip up tanks much quicker with their current assembly lines, the lack of a good amount of heavy industries would be probably a major bottleneck.

Russia needs its factories, workforce and supply chain retuned to churn out war machines, if it did that it would be competitive on the battlefield but it&#39;s wider economy would be ruined.
