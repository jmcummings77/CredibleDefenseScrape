This story has [now resurfaced](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/11/saudi-arabia-asks-to-join-uk-italy-japan-joint-air-combat-programme-tempest-gcap) as Saudi Arabia has \"ramped up\" its negotiation efforts in recent weeks, while reactions from current member countries appear to be mixed.\n\n[Britain and Italy](https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Defense/Saudi-Arabia-pushes-to-join-fighter-jet-project-with-U.K.-Italy-Japan/) are supposedly warm to the idea. The cost of the GCAP program is most likely going to be pricey at best. [One possible guesstimate](https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/global-combat-air-programme-writing-cheques-defence-cant-cash) is about 50 billion USD each from Britain and Japan, while Italy bears 25 billion USD, which is likely closer to a best-case scenario. So members wanting to offload some of that risk by adding other parties is understandable from a purely financial standpoint.\n\nHowever, it's also become evident [that Japan is firmly opposed](https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Defense/Saudi-Arabia-pushes-to-join-fighter-jet-project-with-U.K.-Italy-Japan) to KSA joining for two reasons:\n\n1. Japan is still in the process of trying to modify its self-imposed weapons export restrictions in relation to GCAP, which Japan says may be complicated if Saudi Arabia joins the program.\n2. The timeline is apparently quite tight with delivery aimed at 2035, and having a fourth partner, Japan says, may increase the risk of delays.\n\nSo the situation is clearly complicated (as it usually is with multinational development of complex weapon systems). Will be interesting to see how this turns out.",

The other side of the sign, visible to those in the city center, hints at why the first proclamation is so urgent. It shows an armed soldier standing in front of a helicopter, along with a phone number and a question: \u201cDo you have information about traitors to Ukraine?\u201d \n\nAt the outset of the war, Kupiansk, only 25 miles from the Russian border, fell to Moscow\u2019s forces without a fight and remained under occupation for six months before being retaken in a lightning Ukrainian thrust in the Kharkiv region in the country\u2019s northeast in September. \n\nNow, however, while most attention is focused on the Ukrainian counteroffensive hundreds of miles to the south, Russian forces are mounting an offensive in the north, seeking to regain those lands. Kupiansk, a strategically important city that served as a logistical center for the Russian military, is right in the cross hairs, and many residents say they dread the return of the forces who terrorized them for six months. \n\nA Ukrainian soldier extinguishing a fire that started after shelling in Kupiansk. Residents who remained after the Russian occupation say they are used to the shelling, but most are ready to flee at a moment\u2019s notice. \n\nThe situation has worsened to the extent that the regional authorities announced on Thursday the mandatory evacuation of people living in the district. \n\n\u201cNo one can survive a second occupation,\u201d said Liudmila Sezonova, who runs a honey wholesale business and said she stayed home for months throughout the occupation, hoping that she would not be penalized by the Russians for being a Ukrainian patriot. \n\nDuring those months, \u201cyou could keep your head down and be quiet,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now it is clear who is who and where their loyalties lie.\u201d \n\nFrom her garden patio, where she and her family had to cook on a makeshift stove when there was no electricity, gas or running water during the occupation, the thuds and booms of the war were ever-present. \n\nHer son Albert, 5, never flinches, or even looks up from the shooting game he is playing on his mother\u2019s phone. \n\nThey chose to stay despite the heavy bombardment that came after the Russian withdrawal and destroyed much of the city center, and are weathering an intense period of fighting on the city\u2019s outskirts as Russian forces push to retake the area \u2014 or at least try to force Ukraine to divert some forces from the counteroffensive farther south. \n\n\u201cWe want to raise Kupiansk back up,\u201d said Ms. Sezonova, 38. \u201cIf not us, then who?\u201d \n\n\nAround a fifth of the district\u2019s prewar population of 60,000 stayed despite the heavy bombardment that came after the Russian withdrawal, the mayor said. \n\nBetween the danger of Russian shelling and the mutual mistrust among the city\u2019s residents, it has been difficult to re-establish life in the city, said Oleksandr and Tamara Shapoval, both retirees. \nBut now the fighting is less than five miles from the city, and soldiers defending a growing maze of trenches to its north said the pace of the Russian artillery attacks had increased significantly in recent days. Though she is not evacuating yet, Ms. Sezonova has packed bags for herself and her family, just in case. \n\n\u201cThe hottest direction remains Kupiansk,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s deputy defense minister, Hanna Malyar, said on Monday. \n\nThe Russian Army, Ms. Malyar said, \u201cwants to retake the territories in the Kharkiv region that were lost,\u201d she said. \n\nFor Ms. Sezonova and others who support the Ukrainian war effort and stayed home, the fear of the return of Russian rule is mixed with an abiding distrust and resentment at those accused of collaborating with the occupying powers. Between those who left Kupiansk with the retreating occupiers and those who fear the near-constant shelling, only about a fifth of the district\u2019s prewar population of 60,000 remains, according to Andriy Besedin, the mayor. \n\n\nA local prosecutor, Eduard Myrhorodskyi, at a former police station that he said had been used as a torture center.

A local prosecutor, Eduard Myrhorodskyi, said that once the Ukrainian authorities reasserted control, they found nine torture rooms where they said Russian forces had held local officials who refused to collaborate or people they simply suspected of being pro-Ukrainian. \n\nSome in the new administration say they regard with deep suspicion those who stayed during the occupation, believing they harbor Russian sympathies and could act as saboteurs. \n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t trust anyone in the city,\u201d said one local police officer who commutes daily from Kharkiv, a two-hour drive. He noted the city\u2019s proximity to the border and the uptick in intense fighting. \n\n\u201cNo one in the administration sleeps in the city,\u201d said the police officer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of possible retribution, \u201cbecause they know it is possible they might wake up one morning living under a new flag.\u201d \n\nBetween the danger and the mistrust, it has been difficult to re-establish life in the city, said Oleksandr and Tamara Shapoval, both retirees. Utilities like gas, water and electricity have been restored, but \u201cwe almost don\u2019t see the authorities,\u201d Ms. Shapoval said. \n\n\nA Ukrainian soldier at a defensive position outside Kupiansk. Russian forces have crept within five miles of the city. \n\nThe mayor of Kupiansk, Andriy Besedin, says that only a fraction of city administrators remained, though some more have been hired. \nAnd with good reason. Mr. Besedin, the mayor, said that out of 189 people working in the administration before the Russians invaded, only 10 of them are still in their jobs. Another 30 have been hired since Ukraine took control. \n\nThe Shapovals said they were trying to return a sense of normalcy to their lives, but with an acute awareness of the divided loyalties in their city, it is hard to trust people. Local intelligence operatives told them that at least three of their neighbors had denounced them to the Russians. \n\n\u201cWe lived close to each other, helped each other and then it turned out that they actually wanted to live in Russia,\u201d said Ms. Shapoval, 62, who like many others living in Kupiansk has close relatives in Russia but is ardently pro-Ukrainian. \u201cIt\u2019s like escaping from a lion by going directly into the lion\u2019s mouth.\u201d",

Believe me, the time will come (using your professional terms, I would say that now we are going through the period of turbulence), and in 2024-2025 there will be serious changes in the world,\u201d the head of state said.</p>\n\n<p>Back at the solemn meeting on the occasion of Independence Day, Aleksandr Lukashenko instructed the government and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to suggest a good neighborliness and peace plan to the Western neighbors.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAnd we need to talk to the Poles. I told the prime minister to contact them. If they want, we can talk, patch up our relations. We are neighbors, and this is something you cannot choose, neighbors are given by God. They are having parliamentary elections on 15 October, so they are trying to whip up tensions in order to prove that arming and re-arming the country was the right thing to do. Therefore, before 15 October, they are unlikely to make any significant steps that will benefit them and us. They demand and ask a lot from us, but we cannot agree to this, because it is contrary to our interests,\u201d the president stressed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>eng.belta (.)by/president/view/lukashenko-against-severing-ties-with-eu-160927-2023/</p>\n\n<p>This doesn&#39;t sound like their usual rhetoric about a &quot;brotherly nation manipulated by evil politicians&quot;, he&#39;s talking specifically about the relationship between the governments.</p>\n\n<p>I guess this could mean Belarus will refrain from escalating the tensions for a while.</p>\n\n<p>[1] - eng.belta (.)by/society/view/belarus-slams-belligerence-of-western-neighbors-160893-2023</p>\n\n<p>[2] - eng.belta (.)by/society/view/belarus-patriotic-forces-pass-address-to-polish-people-160871-2023</p>\n</div>",

But once the fund runs out, the real challenge starts: Whoever forms the next government either has to cut spending or convince opposition parties to once again change the constitution and add another special fund. That&#39;ll be the real challenge.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "One fascinating thing about the Ukraine conflict has been the evolution of propaganda. How does social media affect the battlefield?\n\nOn the Ukraine side, we've seen their public relations effort concentrated primarily on appealing to the West. You see this bizarre attempt to balance portraying weakness with exuding strength. Weakness in order to put pressure on foreign governments for additional aid; strength to convey optimism and a sense that the aid will achieve victory. The problem comes when the balance is off. Consider the counteroffensive. How effective their propaganda was that they would sweep all the way to Crimea this year, if only they could get a *crumb* of tanks. Well, they got their crumb of tanks, but it's proving that they overplayed the \"strength\" side of their propaganda balance. They needed more, and the pressure wasn't there to support it. We also see a distinct lack of focus on *training* as a propaganda goal. Mostly just monetary and materiel goals.\n\nOn the other hand, we see Russia. Look at our occasional Russia-aligned posters and how they seek to portray Russia as strong and highly capable. The end goal is pretty obvious: Make it appear as though Russian victory is inevitable. But what about smaller objectives?\n\nFor the past month or so, the Russians have been building an assault force of about three-to-four brigades (10k-15k men) in the Kupyansk area. This somehow became \"Russia has 100k men ready to storm the whole northern front\". End goal: Force Ukraine to abandon the southern counteroffensive. There was a \"breakout\" a week or two ago in an area Ukraine had few troops. The line was easily punctured. But what Russia didn't want known is that that area was poorly defended for a reason. They advanced into a low-lying valley; Ukraine retreated to heights on the West, pounded them with artillery, and drove them back without significant difficulty. The Russians knew this. They simply wanted to inspire panic.\n\nNow, that front is heating up again with an assault directly towards Kupyansk. One of the ways I comb for information is to search for city/village names on Twitter and see what people are saying. Robotyne, Urozhaine, Klishchiivka for example. Usually the news isn't hard to scroll through. But my God in Heaven, typing Kupyansk into Twitter yields literally hundreds and thousands of obvious bot accounts, all promoting the idea that Kupyansk is about to fall, Russia has overrun Ukrainian defenses, Ukraine is panicking. I never blocked anyone on Twitter before, but just to cut down on the chaff and find the wheat, I've had to block hundreds of these spam accounts.\n\nAnd it hit me. Russia looks at propaganda the same way they look at their weapons systems. It's not that they seek quality with their propaganda. They just want to flood an information space so thoroughly that it looks like consensus, or at least sizable opposition, exists. All to manufacture the *perception* that Ukraine is about to lose Kupyansk, which might influence Ukraine to dedicate too many reserves here, losing momentum on Robotyne and Urozhaine at a critical time, and perhaps lower or delay Republican consensus on giving Ukraine more weapons. Absolutely fascinating.\n\nOne key marker of Ukraine versus Russian propaganda: Russian propaganda is in all major languages. Especially Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese. Ukrainian is almost always in English, some German or Polish, occasionally French. The propagandists know their audience.\n\nMakes me wonder how much time and resources really are dedicated to this effort. It seems like something both governments strongly prioritize. The level of coordination and subtlety is like something out of a spy or thriller novel.",

The only thing I would add is that imho the Russian plan around Svatove of the last month was much more important than what is assumed and actually quite well thought out. \n\nIn my opinion it wasn't a simple diversionary action: they probably really expected to reach the watershed between Zherebets and Oskil and in fact that area was perhaps the most suitable along the wider sector, topographically. If they had succeeded in reaching the heights and then managed to entrench, they could have started a second push from a very favorable territory in order to reach Borova. Moreover it was probably the area with the lowest density of Ukrainian forces from Kupyansk to Kreminna.\n\nThe Russians did reconnaissance in force with Storm Z units, shelled the area for a month in an extremely sustained manner according to Ukrainian accounts, and then attacked by employing elements of every maneuver unit of both the 4th Tank Division and the 2nd Army. Which were concentrated in a front of just 15/20 km, manned by a couple of (not particularly famed) Ukrainian brigades. It was a classic Soviet-style attack - recon in force, artillery barrages considerably outfiring the enemy, 3:1 ratio of attackers to defenders, which they most likely achieved in the initial phase of the push. The risk the Ukrainians faced was significant and they definitely suffered from Russian artillery superiority. Thanks to the deployment of reserves (the extent of which remains to be clarified) as well as their own artillery, the Ukrainians were able to contain it well, with the Russians stuck down the valley. It has been a poorly \"mediatized\" offensive - very few videos from either side, not that much equipment deployed (they are mainly forested and hilly areas, though tanks and BMPs were still reported to be employed): it was mostly a battle of artillery and infantry.\n\nHaving realized that the possibility of breakthrough in that area had faded, they are now getting more aggressive around Kupyansk (and in Novoselivske) by employing fresh formations. The Ukrainians are holding out very well luckily, but surely these events are still an headache for them. At the moment, however, I remain of the opinion that the Ukrainian choice not to abandon the eastern bank of the Oskil was correct. \n\nAnyway... As far as Kupyansk is concerned, it has been like 3 times a week since March that the Russian bots have been saying that they had advanced 3 km in one day in that sector, if one is to believe them, he would think they reached Poltava by now. :D",

However</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Russian central bank since yesterday stopped doing this,</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Russian central bank also never really started doing this, it was cancelled mere days after it went into action. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Russians still need dollars for these and since their previous supply of Dollars and Euros, selling oil to the west, is gone they have to start converting the large amount of Rubles they have from selling oil to China and India which drives up the Ruble&#39;s price relative to the dollar.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This part starts off wrong, and gets even wronger, but while the first part is highly complicated and beyond the scope of what I&#39;m willing to write and explain, the second part is dead simple. </p>\n\n<p>This idea of buying Dollars with Rubles given by China and India for the sale of oil which affected &quot;Ruble price relative to the dollar&quot;... wtf? Where do you even come up with this. </p>\n\n<p>The Ruble exchange rate has collapsed fairly evenly accords all currencies. By the very nature of currency exchanges around the world, a nation&#39;s currency can&#39;t simple fall relative to the dollar and not fall against every other currency. </p>\n\n<p>Your entire comment is hilariously false.</p>\n</div>",

This is a nonsense question you invented because you have *just* enough knowledge of the subject to make a fool of yourself.\n\nLet me explain. The NWF is made of two parts, one is the illiquid parts, which is investments made in various companies and projects in Russia. We can ignore this part, it's long term and matters little in the short term. The other part, is the liquid part, this is the stuff that is traded, sold and bought daily to cover expenses, deficit, or to retain for a rainy day fund.\n\nRussia isn't stupid, they know their currency is unstable as hell, and thus a rainy day fund that is denominated in Rubles, would be a real bad choice, which is why their rainy day fund is FOREIGN CURRENCY and GOLD. NOT RUBLES.\n\nThus, you need to ignore the RUBLE values of the NWF, they are meaningless when the RUBLE is fluctuating so badly.\n\n[https://www](https://www).interfax . ru/business/914845\n\n>As of August 1, the fund's liquid assets amounted to the equivalent of 7.183 trillion rubles, or $78.957 billion, which corresponds to 4.8% of GDP projected for 2023, the Ministry of Finance notes.  \n>  \n>The volume of funds in euros in the fund did not change in July, and as of August 1, there were 7.278 billion euros in separate accounts for accounting for the funds of the NWF in the Central Bank in this currency. Also, 280.159 billion Chinese yuan, 508.835 tons of gold in depersonalized form and 5.491 billion rubles (400.4 million rubles a month earlier) were placed on the accounts.\n\nNotice how little Rubles? It's almost meaningless. But the Yuan is now worth more Rubles. The Euro is worth more Rubles. Even the gold is now worth more Rubles. Thus, the NWF is now worth more Rubles. This isn't a good thing, it's just another sign of Russia's declining Ruble.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Russia has had been putting money into its fund from somewhere, coincidently Russian oil is at the highest it's been in a year.\n\nI hope by now you figured out how wrong you were, but if you somehow haven't, let me help you.\n\nRussia hasn't been putting Rubles into the fund. What happened is that the value of the Ruble plummeted, therefor the foreign exchange money of the fund was now worth more Rubles than before.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>no source on when they started.\n\nIf I had to provide a source for every wrong claim you made, I wouldn't leave the keyboard until 2 a.m. If you are interested you can google it up for your self budget rule Russia.\n\nBut, since you are so insistent, here is a source:\n\n[https://www](https://www).kommersant . ru/doc/6159111\n\n>I**n August, the Ministry of Finance for the first time this year began to buy foreign currency and gold under the budget rule,** because in July the budget's oil and gas revenues (811 billion rubles) exceeded the base level (653 billion rubles)\n\nAnd...a few days later they stopped. lol\n\n>The ruble exchange rate is controlled by the Russian central bank it is not a free floating currency, go and try to buy some, or maybe go and ask a Russian to buy some dollars, the only way to do it currently is with crypto.\n\nNot true. It isn't exactly controlled. This is not a controlled drop. And guess what, I don't live in America, nor Europe. I can easily buy Rubles in my local exchange. Your experience is not the same as the rest of the world.\n\nAlso, Russians can buy Dollars. There might be some limits idk exactly, but they absolutely can buy dollars.

Lateral redeployments were found to be extremely effective at holding the front with minimal manpower during WW1. \n\nIf enemies struggle to overcome troops in the line of contact, then there is a lessened need for a strategic reserve. Local reserves from unengaged units can be used instead, because it's less likely that the enemy can attack so many locations at once.\n\nThis is also why Ukraine is also struggling.

Obviously the West supplied Ukraine but if the withdrawal hadn\u2019t be so catastrophic and maybe the Afghan army had shown some results do you think there would have been more support provided to Ukraine in a more timely manner (m1a1, longer range missiles, patriot system). Feel like Russia saw an opening after Afghanistan and they thought Ukraine would collapse in a similar fashion, even though that didn\u2019t occur the lack of support has shown to be a problem (allowing Russia time to fortify and dig in).</p>\n</div>",

Had things gone somewhat to plan, the willingness or otherwise of the US to support Ukraine would have been largely irrelevant. The Ukrainian military would have been in a hopeless position and the country occupied by Russia (I assume Russia would have seized the claimed territories and installed a puppet such as Yanukovych over the remainder). \n\nIn other words, I think Putin's miscalculation was not so much geopolitical as military: he severely overestimated the capability of his armed forces and underestimated the Ukrainians. Possibly this plan would have worked back in 2014 when Ukraine's army was a bit of a joke, but it didn't account for many years of expansion and rearmament since then.\n\nTl;dr it's not always about America!",

The Ukrainian military would have been in a hopeless position and the country occupied by Russia (I assume Russia would have seized the claimed territories and installed a puppet such as Yanukovych over the remainder). </p>\n\n<p>In other words, I think Putin&#39;s miscalculation was not so much geopolitical as military: he severely overestimated the capability of his armed forces and underestimated the Ukrainians. Possibly this plan would have worked back in 2014 when Ukraine&#39;s army was a bit of a joke, but it didn&#39;t account for many years of expansion and rearmament since then.</p>\n\n<p>Tl;dr it&#39;s not always about America!</p>\n</div>",

If the U.S. detainees are set free, Iran will gain access to billions of dollars of oil revenues trapped in South Korea under U.S. sanctions.\n\n>U.S. and European officials have told Iran that if there is de-escalation of tensions over the summer, they would be open to broader talks later this year, including on Iran's nuclear program.\n\n>For the Biden administration, the hope is to avoid any major crisis with Tehran in the lead-up to next year's presidential elections. Critics in Washington and elsewhere say the U.S. is preparing to reward Iran for taking U.S. citizens hostage and for a minor pause in its nuclear work while Tehran ramps up regional threats and supplies military assistance to Russia for its war against Ukraine.\n\n>Since the U.S. left the 2015 Iranian nuclear accord, which lifted international sanctions on Tehran in exchange for strict but temporary limitations on its nuclear work, Tehran has massively expanded its program. The Biden administration sought to revive the nuclear pact when it took office, but those talks broke down last year.\n\n>Among the most worrying parts of its work for Western officials is Tehran's production of 60% enriched uranium, which U.S. officials say could be turned into enough weapons-grade material for a nuclear bomb in less than two weeks.\n\n>>Moves appear intentional\n\n>U.S. officials had hoped Tehran would stop accumulating 60% enriched uranium as one of a series of de-escalatory steps from both sides, which included the prisoners deal.\n\n>According to the people, Iran has diluted a small amount of 60% enriched uranium in recent weeks and slowed the rate at which it is accumulating new material. Iran's stockpile has grown since the 114 kilograms of highly enriched uranium Iran was recorded having in May, but it could easily dilute more of the 60% it has produced to get back to that level. It isn't yet clear if Tehran plans to do that.\n\n>Iran was adding just short of 9 kilograms of 60% to its stockpile on average between February and May.\n\n>The United Nations atomic agency is expected to release its next report on Iran's nuclear program in late August or early September.\n\n>While Iran's production rate of enriched uranium can fluctuate for a number of technical reasons -- including maintenance work at one of its two nuclear facilities -- the fact that Iran has diluted some highly enriched uranium strongly suggests the slower accumulation of 60% material is intentional.\n\n>Nonetheless, even if it does stop accumulating 60% material, Tehran has enough of the material for at least two nuclear bombs. U.S. officials said this year Iran could field a nuclear weapon within several months.\n\n>Iran's mission to the International Atomic Energy Agency didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Neither did the IAEA.\n\n>Following secret indirect talks this spring involving senior U.S. and Iranian officials, Biden administration officials set out several steps they hoped Tehran would take to lower tensions. In addition to stopping the accumulation of 60% material, they said they hoped Iran would show better cooperation with the IAEA and stop attacks by Iran or its proxies on U.S. forces and personnel.\n\n>In exchange, Iran was set to win access to some $6 billion in energy-sales revenue frozen in South Korea and possibly, other moneys from the International Monetary Fund.\n\n>>Risk of delays\n\n>While the Biden administration has largely given up hopes of reviving the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, U.S. officials continue to say publicly they are seeking to avert a nuclear crisis through diplomacy. If the de-escalation effort bears fruit, the two sides could meet on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in September and map out further talks.\n\n>This week's release from jail of four American prisoners was the first step in a two-track plan, according to U.S. and European officials. A fifth U.S. citizen is under house arrest.\n\n>In a first stage, the diplomats said the American detainees would be released from prison in exchange for the transfer of up to $6 billion in Iranian oil revenue from South Korea to Switzerland, which represents U.S. interests in Iran. As a second step, likely to take several weeks, the U.S. citizens would be permitted to leave Iran once the Iranian money from South Korea reaches banks in Qatar, which Iran can access but Washington keeps under close watch.\n\n>U.S. officials warned this week that they were still working on moving the South Korean funds and cautioned that the eventual release of the detainees could be delayed by disagreements in Tehran or the emergence of new flashpoints with Iran.\n\n>U.S. officials insisted that Iran would only be able to use the funds to buy food and medical goods for humanitarian purposes. Critics say the money would free up other Iranian government funds to be used for more nefarious purposes.\n\n>Just as the prisoner issue and the enrichment of near-weapons-grade material have started to move in the right direction, there have been no serious attacks on U.S. forces in the region by Tehran or its proxies since late March when a U.S. contractor was killed.\n\n>However in the last couple of weeks, the U.S. has rushed planes, ships and Marines to the Gulf because of the Iranian threat to shipping in the Gulf, an unusual and substantial deployment.\n\n>\"There is selective de-escalation in some areas and escalation in other areas and I think, in general, both sides are likely seeking a lowering of tensions but they have different definitions of the scope of de-escalation,\" said Henry Rome, senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.",

In addition to stopping the accumulation of 60% material, they said they hoped Iran would show better cooperation with the IAEA and stop attacks by Iran or its proxies on U.S. forces and personnel.</p>\n\n<p>In exchange, Iran was set to win access to some $6 billion in energy-sales revenue frozen in South Korea and possibly, other moneys from the International Monetary Fund.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Risk of delays</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While the Biden administration has largely given up hopes of reviving the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, U.S. officials continue to say publicly they are seeking to avert a nuclear crisis through diplomacy. If the de-escalation effort bears fruit, the two sides could meet on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in September and map out further talks.</p>\n\n<p>This week&#39;s release from jail of four American prisoners was the first step in a two-track plan, according to U.S. and European officials. A fifth U.S. citizen is under house arrest.</p>\n\n<p>In a first stage, the diplomats said the American detainees would be released from prison in exchange for the transfer of up to $6 billion in Iranian oil revenue from South Korea to Switzerland, which represents U.S. interests in Iran. As a second step, likely to take several weeks, the U.S. citizens would be permitted to leave Iran once the Iranian money from South Korea reaches banks in Qatar, which Iran can access but Washington keeps under close watch.</p>\n\n<p>U.S. officials warned this week that they were still working on moving the South Korean funds and cautioned that the eventual release of the detainees could be delayed by disagreements in Tehran or the emergence of new flashpoints with Iran.</p>\n\n<p>U.S. officials insisted that Iran would only be able to use the funds to buy food and medical goods for humanitarian purposes. Critics say the money would free up other Iranian government funds to be used for more nefarious purposes.</p>\n\n<p>Just as the prisoner issue and the enrichment of near-weapons-grade material have started to move in the right direction, there have been no serious attacks on U.S. forces in the region by Tehran or its proxies since late March when a U.S. contractor was killed.</p>\n\n<p>However in the last couple of weeks, the U.S. has rushed planes, ships and Marines to the Gulf because of the Iranian threat to shipping in the Gulf, an unusual and substantial deployment.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;There is selective de-escalation in some areas and escalation in other areas and I think, in general, both sides are likely seeking a lowering of tensions but they have different definitions of the scope of de-escalation,&quot; said Henry Rome, senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

As an illustrative example, but an order of magnitude more extreme - the ruble is far from being in *that* dire a situation -- Africa is full of exceptionally resource-rich countries whose currencies are, nonetheless, entirely worthless. That's not because nobody wants their resources, it's just nobody trusts they'll be able to use their currencies, so *if* they're forced to accept them for whatever reason, they dump them as quickly as they can.\n\nRussia isn't there yet, but the mechanisms are similar to what other regimes faced when dealing with protracted foreign wars (e.g. late-stage Estado Novo Portugal) or poor economic policies that put a lot of pressure on state spending (communist Romania). It's not that people didn't want these countries' resources -- they did-- it's just that they weren't certain that companies (and state institutions) that worked with them were going to be able to pay for things. Similarly, they're starting to doubt that companies and state institutions that need rubles to run are going to be able to pay for things. So they avoid dealing with the ruble if possible.\n\nRussia exports little else of value, and its government's policies aren't particularly friendly to foreign investors (not that there are too many people willing to risk it at this point anyway). So their only choice is to keep trading for resources. However, that doesn't necessarily increase the value of the ruble -- trading for *rubles* does. On the other hand, if internal economy is dependent on foreign currency to some degree -- e.g. for acquiring resources, buying equipment, handling the logistics that keeps the resource trade going and so on -- that puts additional pressure on the ruble.\n\nThe Central Bank can finance that pressure for a while, but if they keep throwing reserves at it, large commercial players are eventually going to start losing faith, as reserves do eventually run out. That *further* compounds pressure on the ruble, and in the long run can force Russia to not just sell its resources at a lower price to keep them competitive, but also accept increasingly lower prices for the ruble.\n\nIt's nothing we haven't seen before, but it's also far too soon to tell if the Central Bank will be able to fix this, too, or not.",

It&#39;s not that people didn&#39;t want these countries&#39; resources -- they did-- it&#39;s just that they weren&#39;t certain that companies (and state institutions) that worked with them were going to be able to pay for things. Similarly, they&#39;re starting to doubt that companies and state institutions that need rubles to run are going to be able to pay for things. So they avoid dealing with the ruble if possible.</p>\n\n<p>Russia exports little else of value, and its government&#39;s policies aren&#39;t particularly friendly to foreign investors (not that there are too many people willing to risk it at this point anyway). So their only choice is to keep trading for resources. However, that doesn&#39;t necessarily increase the value of the ruble -- trading for <em>rubles</em> does. On the other hand, if internal economy is dependent on foreign currency to some degree -- e.g. for acquiring resources, buying equipment, handling the logistics that keeps the resource trade going and so on -- that puts additional pressure on the ruble.</p>\n\n<p>The Central Bank can finance that pressure for a while, but if they keep throwing reserves at it, large commercial players are eventually going to start losing faith, as reserves do eventually run out. That <em>further</em> compounds pressure on the ruble, and in the long run can force Russia to not just sell its resources at a lower price to keep them competitive, but also accept increasingly lower prices for the ruble.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s nothing we haven&#39;t seen before, but it&#39;s also far too soon to tell if the Central Bank will be able to fix this, too, or not.</p>\n</div>",
