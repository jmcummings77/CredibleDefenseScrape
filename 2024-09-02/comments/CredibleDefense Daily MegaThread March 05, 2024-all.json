        "body": "The WSJ has further reporting on Ukrainian SOF [raids](https://www.wsj.com/world/ukraine-is-now-fighting-russia-in-sudan-87caf1d8) on Wagner and Wagner trained forces in Sudan. While the reporting isn\u2019t too distinct from what was previously reported, there are still some interesting tidbits on the kind of hit-and-run tactics that are being employed by Ukraine to stretch Russian capabilities. Excerpts:\n\n>For Ukraine, sending troops to Africa is an audacious new venture -- part of a strategy to disrupt Russia's military and economic operations abroad, make the war more costly for Moscow, and position itself as a bulwark against Russian incursions, including in regions where the West has been reluctant to get directly involved.\n\n>\"It's impossible to overcome Russia simply by fighting on a small piece of land, like the front line in Ukraine,\" said a 40-year-old Ukrainian officer, who goes by the call sign Prada and led one of the Ukrainian teams in Sudan. \"If they have gold mines in Sudan, we need to make them not profitable.\"\n\n>The first wave of Ukrainian troops -- nearly 100 soldiers, mostly from HUR's Timur unit -- landed on a charter jet in Sudan in mid-August. The Russian influence in the country was immediately apparent: Sudanese soldiers who had been trained in Russian military academies served as translators.\n\n>A 30-year-old HUR officer known by the call sign King, who led the first group of Ukrainians to arrive in Sudan, said his team found a vastly different kind of conflict than the one they had left behind in Eastern Europe. Soldiers on both sides fought in sandals and sometimes fired entire magazines' worth of ammunition while holding their rifles over their heads, unable to see what they were shooting at. \n\n>Neither side attacked at night. The Ukrainians, equipped with night-vision goggles and drones, saw an opening.\n\n>\"That was our big advantage -- we knew how to operate at night,\" King said.\n\n>The Ukrainian teams always pulled back to their base by morning, wary of drawing attention.\n\n>\"Even if we wanted to do something during the day, we're a group of white people,\" King said. \"Everyone would realize what was going on.\"\n\n>Sudan has become a battlefield in the Russia-Ukraine war because it is rich in two resources: weapons and gold.\n\n>During frequent conflicts in the country over several decades, arms poured in -- directly and indirectly -- from the U.S., Russia, China and elsewhere. As a result, Sudan had plenty of weaponry to spare in early 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine and Kyiv was searching for all the arms it could find.\n\n>\"We took a lot of weapons out of Sudan at one time. Different countries paid for it,\" Budanov, Ukraine's military intelligence chief, said. \"They had a wide range of weapons...You can find everything from Chinese to American weapons there.\"\n\n>Meanwhile, Russia has long been plumbing Sudan for gold. Wagner led Moscow's operation in the country, as it did in several other African nations. They trained RSF fighters, who in turn provided security for Russian entities at the mines.\n\n>Before the conflict in Sudan began last spring, only 30% of the gold mined in the country was officially registered with the central bank, leaving $4 billion of gold annually unaccounted for, according to Sudanese officials and activists. Much of that smuggled gold ended up in Russian hands, activists say.\n\n>When the civil war erupted, the RSF initially refused Wagner's offer of heavy weapons, concerned about alienating the U.S. But following military setbacks in April, the group reversed course, according to international security officials. On April 28, a convoy of Toyota pickups supervised by Wagner brought weapons, including shoulder-mounted antiaircraft missiles from the neighboring Central African Republic, where Wagner has established a power base in recent years. Wagner also began recruiting men from the Central African Republic to fight in Sudan and the RSF soon advanced into Khartoum.\n\n>After the death of Wagner's leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin last year, the Russian defense ministry took control of the group's operations in Africa, though it is still widely known as Wagner. The Russian defense ministry didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\n>\"Wagner has become like a franchise in Sudan. They fight using locals. They give them patches, pay them a salary, and say, 'Now you're Wagner, '\" Prada said. \"It was never our goal to chase individual Wagner soldiers. The goal was to disrupt Russian interests in Sudan.\"\n\nThe [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-68322230) has a decent summary of a new RUSI report on the new Russian rent-a-mercenary (except it\u2019s the Russian MoD) enterprise in West Africa as well:\n\n>Russia is offering governments in Africa a \"regime survival package\" in exchange for access to strategically important natural resources, a major new report has found.\n\n>Internal Russian government documents, seen by the BBC, also detail how it is working to change mining laws in West Africa, with the ambition of dislodging Western companies from an area of strategic importance.\n\n>This is part of the process of the Russian government taking over the businesses of the Wagner mercenary group, broken up after a failed coup in June 2023.\n\n>The multibillion dollar operations are now mostly being run as the Russian \"Expeditionary Corps\", managed by the man accused of being behind the attempt to murder Sergei Skripal using the Novichok nerve agent on the streets of the UK - a charge Russia has denied.\n\n>>\"This is the Russian state coming out of the shadows in its Africa policy,\" says Jack Watling, land warfare specialist at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) and one of the report's authors.\n\n>According to Dr Watling, \"there was a meeting in the Kremlin fairly shortly after Prigozhin's mutiny, in which it was decided that Wagner's Africa operations would fall directly under the control of Russian military intelligence, the GRU\".\n\n>Control was to be handed to Gen Andrey Averyanov, head of Unit 29155, a secretive operation specialising in targeting killings and destabilising foreign governments.\n\n>In early September, accompanied by deputy Defence Minister Yunus-Bek Yevkurov, Gen Averyanov began a tour of former Wagner operations in Africa.\n\n>They started in Libya, meeting warlord Gen Khalifa Haftar. Their next stop was Burkina Faso where they were greeted by 35-year-old coup leader Ibrahim Traor\u00e9.\n\n>After that, they landed in the Central African Republic, possibly the most well-established Wagner operation on the continent, before heading to Mali to meet the leaders of the junta there.\n\n>On a subsequent trip they also met General Salifou Modi, one of the military men who seized power in Niger last year.\n\n>Reports of the meeting with Capt Traor\u00e9 of Burkina Faso confirmed cooperation would continue in \"the military domain, including the training of Burkinabe officer cadets and officers at all levels, including pilots in Russia\".\n\n>The three West African states with close links to Wagner - Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso - have all experienced military takeovers in recent years. They have since announced their withdrawal from the regional bloc Ecowas, and the creation of their own \"Alliance of Sahel States\".\n\n>Maybe the most entwined with the mercenaries was Mali, where an ongoing Islamist insurgency, combined with multiple coups, had left an essentially failed state.\n\n>\"What the Russians have provided is a strike force, with helicopters with advanced capabilities and a lot of firepower,\" says Dr Watling. \"They are using pretty traditional Soviet anti-partisan methods. You see fighters who were executed, as well as civilians targeted for enabling or being associated with fighters.\"\n\n>In exchange for considerable, if brutal, security assistance, Wagner required something in return.\n\n>According to Dr Watling, Wagner was operating in a well-established tradition: \"There is a standard Russian modus operandi, which is that you cover the operational costs with parallel business activity. In Africa, that is primarily through mining concessions.\"\n\n>In every country in which it operates, Wagner was reported to have secured valuable natural resources using these to not only cover costs, but also extract significant revenue. Russia has extracted $2.5bn (\u00a32bn) worth of gold from Africa in the past two years, which is likely to have helped fund its war in Ukraine, according to the Blood Gold Report.\n\n>The report details internal Russian memos focussed on trying to achieve in Niger what was done in Mali. If Russia managed to gain control of West Africa's uranium mines, Europe could be left exposed once again to what has often been called Russian \"energy blackmail\".\n\n>France is more dependent on nuclear power than any other country in the world, with 56 reactors producing almost two-thirds of the country's energy. About a fifth of its uranium is imported from Niger. There have previously been complaints about the terms of trade, with suggestions that the former colonial power exploits nations like Niger.\n\n>\"The narrative that Russia is pushing is that Western states remain fundamentally colonial in their attitude,\" says Dr Watling. \"It's very ironic because the Russian approach, which is to isolate these regimes, capture their elites and to extract their natural resources, is quite colonial.\"\n\n>According to Dr Watling, the fundamental change lies in \"the overtness with which Russia is pursuing its policy\". Prigozhin's Wagner Group had always provided Russia with a level of plausible deniability in operations and influence abroad.\n\n>Following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, many in the Western security apparatus say that Russia's mask has slipped.\n\n>\"What they are looking to do is to exacerbate our crises internationally. They are trying to start fires elsewhere, and expand those that already exist, making a less safe world,\" Dr Watling.",

Be pretty easy for me to say I'd go, knowing they wouldn't take me.\u00a0\n\n\nWould I want others to go? Yeah. Would I be more willing to continue working in the Mic to support the war effort instead of working civilian space like I want to? Yeah, but that's not much of a sacrifice. Would I go if I could? Honestly--I don't know. I know I planned to join before the medical problems started. I'd like to think I'd make the same choice, but it's easy to think of hypotheticals.\n\n\nAll I know is, the world is breaking down. When I was growing up, wars of conquest seemed like a thing in Africa, not \"civilized\" places. But now we're seriously talking about invasions of the Baltics, war between NATO and Russia, and a fight over Taiwan against a rising China. Russia's invasion cannot be seen as successful by anyone. If it is, it will be repeated. And that makes us all much less safe.\n\n\nRight now, it's a bunch of Russia-friendly farmland and coal towns in Ukraine. Tomorrow it might be ethnic Russians in Lithuania, or \"reuniting\" China, or ending the Korean War.

Would I be more willing to continue working in the Mic to support the war effort instead of working civilian space like I want to? Yeah, but that&#39;s not much of a sacrifice. Would I go if I could? Honestly--I don&#39;t know. I know I planned to join before the medical problems started. I&#39;d like to think I&#39;d make the same choice, but it&#39;s easy to think of hypotheticals.</p>\n\n<p>All I know is, the world is breaking down. When I was growing up, wars of conquest seemed like a thing in Africa, not &quot;civilized&quot; places. But now we&#39;re seriously talking about invasions of the Baltics, war between NATO and Russia, and a fight over Taiwan against a rising China. Russia&#39;s invasion cannot be seen as successful by anyone. If it is, it will be repeated. And that makes us all much less safe.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, it&#39;s a bunch of Russia-friendly farmland and coal towns in Ukraine. Tomorrow it might be ethnic Russians in Lithuania, or &quot;reuniting&quot; China, or ending the Korean War. If no one thinks the US is willing to do much about small conflicts, then by degrees we&#39;ll be brought to larger and larger ones.

Today's Armenia strives for democracy and rule of law. That's anathema to Iran.\n\n\nIn any case, Iran is supposedly blocking arms transfers from India to Armenia. That's fine since Georgia has lately started to allow arms transfers to Armenia, initially from France.\n\n\nFurthermore, Armenia pushed for Georgia's EU candidacy, trying to make the EU understand how important Georgia is geopolitically (it's essentially Armenia's only lifeline).

The engines themselves are light enough that a \"tugboat\" is well within the capacities of Russian and Chinese lift vehicles to put in orbit.\n\nOverall pretty unlikely they actually go through with it, but on paper this is indeed the cheapest and most efficient way of putting stuff on the moon.

            "body": "It is worth noting that [the Ukrainians *did* in fact attack a Russian oil tanker with Seababy USVs](https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/05/europe/ukraine-sea-drone-attacks-intl/index.html) last summer, during the height of the grain shipment season, and after Russia pulled out of the grain corridor and began harassing ships headed for Ukrainian ports. Relatedly, shortly before that attack, Ukraine conducted those Stormshadow strikes on Sevastopol which destroyed the BSF HQ and a Kilo-class submarine in dry dock. Then, Russia stopped trying to interdict Ukrainian grain shipments, in part because the BSF was penned up in the far eastern Black Sea, but not entirely, because the BSF has an enormous asymmetric advantage in submarine warfare capabilities. Ukraine has no anti-submarine warfare capabilities, so would not be able to defend civilian shipping against submarine attacks at all. And Kilos should be able to do the round trip from Novorossiysk to the shipping channels into Odesa entirely submerged, without ever needing to risk UAV, USV, or any other kind of attack.\n\nIn any case, the Ukrainian attack on the oil tanker damaged but did not sink the ship, although it did take one of Russia's largest oil tankers out of action for a while and that certainly inflicted some economic harm on Russia, but that was almost certainly not Ukraine's primary objective. Insofar as I am aware, this oil tanker has been the only civilian vessel which the Ukrainians have attacked at any point during the entire war, including even back to 2014. The Ukrainians claimed the ship was a legal target because it was carrying war cargo in the form of oil (which can be used to produce fuel for military vehicles, and that is at least facially a reasonable argument), although the crew claimed that it was actually empty at the time of the attack. Which I'd believe, and frankly I don't see an issue with it if the tanker was empty. It would be perverse if it were not only illegal for Ukraine to attack an empty tanker about to enter port where it is known to frequently pick up war-related goods/sanctioned oil, but also the only circumstance under which it would ever then be legal to attack a tanker would be *after* it picks up its environmentally toxic cargo and thus cannot responsibly be attacked.\n\nIn any case, despite not scoring a kill, the Ukrainians seem to have made their point, because the Russians stopped messing around with grain shipments for the most part not long after that attack. And it has most likely been Ukraine's asymmetric naval threat to Russia's civilian shipping over the Black Sea that has ultimately deterred the BSF from unrestricted submarine warfare. Although most of the Russia's crude oil exports flow out of ports elsewhere in country, the Black Sea ports still represent a major source of cash flow for the Kremlin, and one which cannot be replaced easily because of the unusual arrangements around the Caspian Pipeline Consortium. The CPC links Kazakh oil fields to the Russian oil and gas pipeline networks, and ultimately to a port near Novorossiysk, which is currently the only way for the very substantial amounts of oil from those fields to make it to market. While in transit, the Russians mix around 20% of their own (sanctioned) oil in with the (unsanctioned) Kazakh oil, and have increased the percentage over the course of the war because it effectively allows them to bypass sanctions. The CPC thus represents a disproportionately important source of forex for the government. Also something like 70% of Russia's grain exports are shipped through ports on the Black Sea.\n\nUnrestricted submarine warfare is a doubled edged sword, and one that cuts against Russia more than Ukraine, because Russia has substantially more trade that would be at risk. For their part, the Ukrainians really do need that grain revenue, so I don't think they will be the first to break the current detente. At least not in the near future.",

And Kilos should be able to do the round trip from Novorossiysk to the shipping channels into Odesa entirely submerged, without ever needing to risk UAV, USV, or any other kind of attack.</p>\n\n<p>In any case, the Ukrainian attack on the oil tanker damaged but did not sink the ship, although it did take one of Russia&#39;s largest oil tankers out of action for a while and that certainly inflicted some economic harm on Russia, but that was almost certainly not Ukraine&#39;s primary objective. Insofar as I am aware, this oil tanker has been the only civilian vessel which the Ukrainians have attacked at any point during the entire war, including even back to 2014. The Ukrainians claimed the ship was a legal target because it was carrying war cargo in the form of oil (which can be used to produce fuel for military vehicles, and that is at least facially a reasonable argument), although the crew claimed that it was actually empty at the time of the attack. Which I&#39;d believe, and frankly I don&#39;t see an issue with it if the tanker was empty. It would be perverse if it were not only illegal for Ukraine to attack an empty tanker about to enter port where it is known to frequently pick up war-related goods/sanctioned oil, but also the only circumstance under which it would ever then be legal to attack a tanker would be <em>after</em> it picks up its environmentally toxic cargo and thus cannot responsibly be attacked.</p>\n\n<p>In any case, despite not scoring a kill, the Ukrainians seem to have made their point, because the Russians stopped messing around with grain shipments for the most part not long after that attack. And it has most likely been Ukraine&#39;s asymmetric naval threat to Russia&#39;s civilian shipping over the Black Sea that has ultimately deterred the BSF from unrestricted submarine warfare. Although most of the Russia&#39;s crude oil exports flow out of ports elsewhere in country, the Black Sea ports still represent a major source of cash flow for the Kremlin, and one which cannot be replaced easily because of the unusual arrangements around the Caspian Pipeline Consortium. The CPC links Kazakh oil fields to the Russian oil and gas pipeline networks, and ultimately to a port near Novorossiysk, which is currently the only way for the very substantial amounts of oil from those fields to make it to market. While in transit, the Russians mix around 20% of their own (sanctioned) oil in with the (unsanctioned) Kazakh oil, and have increased the percentage over the course of the war because it effectively allows them to bypass sanctions. The CPC thus represents a disproportionately important source of forex for the government. Also something like 70% of Russia&#39;s grain exports are shipped through ports on the Black Sea.</p>\n\n<p>Unrestricted submarine warfare is a doubled edged sword, and one that cuts against Russia more than Ukraine, because Russia has substantially more trade that would be at risk. For their part, the Ukrainians really do need that grain revenue, so I don&#39;t think they will be the first to break the current detente. At least not in the near future.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "Another in the \"it is failing - no it is not\" cycle of Russian economic news that we've witnessed since war's first months, and those first confident predictions of the imminent collapse of the Russian economy.\n\nFrankly, I understand little of the complex mechanism of sanctions, loopholes, caps and cap-evading mechanism. What is clear to me, looking back at 2022 and 2023, is that expert predictions, even from reputable sources, have consistently failed to materialise.\n\nAny article published in 2022 or 2023 that accurately predicted the way the economic war was going to develop would have been laughed at and ridiculed back then as Russian propaganda by useful idiots. Yet here we are. Are our leading economists just incapable of making even halfway accurate predictions? Or are they just blinded by bias and wishful thinking? Does the unfounded optimism just filter down from the political circles always convinced that the latest sanction tool will bring the whole enemy's rotten structure down?\n\n\n\n>[Russia\u2019s Oil and Gas Revenue Jumped in February in Budget Boost - Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-05/russia-s-oil-and-gas-revenue-jumped-in-february-in-budget-boost?utm_source=website&utm_medium=share&utm_campaign=copy)\n\n>*Russia\u2019s oil and gas revenue jumped more than 80% in February from a year earlier to over $10 billion due to higher prices for the nation\u2019s crude as its producers withstood Western sanctions.*\n\n>Budget proceeds from taxes on oil and gas totaled 945.6 billion rubles ($10.4 billion) last month, the Finance Ministry said Tuesday. Levies on crude and petroleum products \u2014 which accounted for 84% of total hydrocarbon revenues \u2014 more than doubled, according to Bloomberg calculations based on the data.\n\n>The oil taxes were calculated using an average price of Urals \u2014 Russia\u2019s main export blend \u2014 of $65 a barrel. That\u2019s up from less than $50 a year ago.\n\n>[Budget Revenue Surges in February From a Year Ago](https://imgur.com/a/RpLrjZe)\n\n>...\n\n>But to shield cash flows to the budget, Russia has activated a so-called price floor mechanism, ordering producers to pay taxes based on an artificial $15-a-barrel discount for Urals to Brent.

Yet here we are. Are our leading economists just incapable of making even halfway accurate predictions? Or are they just blinded by bias and wishful thinking?

Levies on crude and petroleum products \u2014 which accounted for 84% of total hydrocarbon revenues \u2014 more than doubled, according to Bloomberg calculations based on the data.</p>\n\n<p>The oil taxes were calculated using an average price of Urals \u2014 Russia\u2019s main export blend \u2014 of $65 a barrel.
