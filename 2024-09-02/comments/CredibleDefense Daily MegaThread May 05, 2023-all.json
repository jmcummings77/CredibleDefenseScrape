Today, Militaryland posted an article and created unit pages (placeholders, but still) for these brigades, so we can move them from rumor to confirmed.  Further, the article  acknowledges my previous speculation/conclusion that the Ukrainian Ground Forces was not organizing green units, but building brigades from cadre, amalgamating at least one of the Independent Infantry Battalions.  \n\nThe article also provides some additional confirmation on the organization of the 78th Air Assault Brigade, so I took a deep dive on their facebook page- Creation of this unit owes more to the 'accretion' path I documented for the 3rd/5th Assault brigades and the 67th Mechanized Brigade (Right Sector), and which I'm predicting for the  Kalinouski Regiment. \n\n Essentially, they started as independent volunteer units formed early last year around a community (ethnic, political or social), initially small, growing over time from their interest group, until they are the size of several battalions- At which point they 'come in from the cold' and become official brigades, upgrading vehicles and regularizing tank/artillery/engineering/ect. with the big boys. \n\nThe 78th Gert Regiment was one of two commando/deep recon flavored special force units owned by, of all people, the Intelligence Directorate. They've grown too big for this role, so they're transitioning to an AAB brigade, filling out a third battalion with various alumni, returning injured and well wishers.  A Gert, displayed prominently on their unit patch, is related to a Ukrainian folk tale I can't track down (perhaps related to the Germanic Gert, a strong spear- The Gert is shown with a spear).  \n\nThis development leads me to contemplate the future of Intelligence's remaining unit, Kraken.   If the ID was pressured to get out of the operational unit business (everyone else, from the IM to the AAF have been integrated into the ground forces' command structure) the Kraken, rumored to already be brigade sized, will surely be next. It may go to Special Operations command rather than the regular army, though it has on occasion blurred the line between SO and Assault, so who really knows.\n\nFinally, a contextual update on the issue of supplying tank battalions to the new units. The 41st OMB has an incep date of 3/16/23 and wasn't part of the 'big 12' new brigades mentioned in the leak documents.

He is the most despicable sort of person and I&#39;m kind of astounded at the SBU&#39;s patience for letting this guy run his mouth for so long, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nakipeloua/status/1654481158917218314?s=20\">but the payoff with this hilarious, humiliating arrest video showing off his squalid apartment was worth it at least.</a></p>\n\n<p>This is also another reminder to take some of Lazerpig&#39;s bigger claims with some skepticism. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lazerpig/comments/11p1j0e/lazerpig_dropped_the_story_on_gonzalo_lira/\">Lazerpig reported six weeks or so ago</a> that Lira had already been deported stemming from his arrest and brief disappearance in 2022 supposedly in relation to his participation in a Russian spy ring, but that appears to be untrue considering he&#39;s just been arrested now finally.</p>\n</div>",

But they wouldn&#39;t be able to use it everywhere, and they&#39;d glow with the light of the sun if they did. Can HARMs be used on EW devices? If so, that would be a good use of them.</p>\n</div>",

Everyone has side businesses or some other hustle going on.

An initial target of 50 was met in February and the technology delivers a cost-effective and efficient way of deepening US partnerships, he said. \n\n>The plan is being carried out as Iran, emboldened by a China-brokered deal to re-establish relations with US ally Saudi Arabia, seized a second oil tanker in less than a week. The US Navy released footage of boats it said were owned by Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps swarming the Panama-flagged oil tanker Niovi as it sailed through the Strait of Hormuz, between Iran and Oman. \n\n>In addition to Iran, the US is concerned about China\u2019s efforts to expand military and security ties with Gulf Arab states, who have historically relied on the US for defense needs. China, the largest trading partner for most of those countries and the top buyer of crude oil from the region, already has a naval base in Djibouti in the Horn of Africa. \n\n>It\u2019s only logical China would want military bases in the Middle East to be \u201ccloser to the action,\u201d said John Schaus, a defense expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\n>In March, China held joint naval drills with Iran and Russia in the Gulf Oman.\n\n>\u201cYou can\u2019t compare a rudimentary exercise to the broad sophisticated integration with large partners that we are leading here,\u201d said Cooper, referring to those drills. He described a US-led maritime exercise earlier this year as the largest in the region, involving 42 countries, 7,000 people, 35 ships and 30 USVs. It also included a mock patient transfer in a USV.\n\n>>Bahrain Base\n\n>In an operations room at the Bahrain naval base packed with screens and computers, Captain Colin Corridan, commander of Task Force 59 which is responsible for deploying the new USVs, said a lot of the footage and information collected from the sea robots is synthesized by artificial intelligence to ease the burden on humans. The USVs are made by Canadian, Israeli and US companies, among others, and cost from $800,000 to $3 million. They range in size from slow-moving solar-powered buoys to large unmanned speed boats.\n\n>\u201cThey are just eyes on the water constantly sending signals,\u201d said Corridan. \n\n>At an outdoor hangar displaying some of the USV models, Lieutenant Commander Jorge Lens from the Spanish navy and a member of Corridan\u2019s task force says some unmanned vessels can stay out for months without the need to refuel and resupply \u2014 the record is 220 days in the Red Sea. \n\n>Julie Angus, co-founder of Canada\u2019s Open Ocean Robotics which manufactures USVs, was among those who traveled to Bahrain in November to take part in a naval exercise.  She has also touted the autonomous vessels\u2019 potential in the field of marine conservation.  \n\n>So far only Bahrain and Kuwait have publicly announced plans to buy USVs, according to Commander Tim Hawkins, a spokesperson for US and coalition naval forces in Bahrain. The Iran tanker seizures are precisely why the \u201cmore enhanced visibility\u201d provided by USVs is critical to regional security and stability, he said in emailed comments.\n\n>Bilal Saab, director of the Defense and Security Program at the Washington-based Middle East Institute, warned the US faces an uphill battle convincing Gulf Arab states, who typically take large and expensive military gear, of the utility of these vessels. That said, USVs are exempt from the lengthy Foreign Military Sales process that Gulf countries often complain about.\n\n>\u201cIt\u2019s mind-boggling, your entire economy and national survival depends on your export of oil yet you do not have the maritime capabilities to secure your waters, they have always relied on us,\u201d said Saab.\n\n>The US military including the Navy must also contend with the narrative that its attention is turning away from the Middle East and Gulf Arab states have to think of security alternatives \u2014 including potential alliances with China and Russia.\n\n>Bahrain\u2019s Undersecretary for Political Affairs Abdulla bin Ahmed al Khalifa said that while his own country is committed to its partnership, certain regional states are frustrated with the human-rights conditions often attached to US military sales. This is making them look elsewhere.\n\n>\u201cIt\u2019s an open market,\u201d he said in an interview.",

Definitely changes things. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>And here&#39;s some more food for thought: If Germany pays 100\u20ac to a foreign company for IFVs, that money goes to the other country. If you pay it to a German company, you pay more, but of those 150\u20ac you will get a lot back through taxes on the company and the wages of the German workers that build the Puma</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Absolutely valid point. And Puma is also created for Bundeswehr requirements basically. But people here are saying CV90 is not modern and other things, which is very untrue, hence my previous reply.</p>\n</div>",

Only 8% said the aim should be to weaken or defeat Russia, while 18% chose preventing Russian expansionism. It is notable that the differences between Democrats and Republicans on this issue are far smaller than on any other issue regarding Ukraine.      \n> \n> **The Public Shows Signs of Impatience with the War**\n> \n> A plurality of Americans, 46%, said the United States should stay the course in supporting Ukraine for only one to two years, compared with 38% who said the United States should stay the course for as long as it takes. The partisan divide was notable on this issue, with 62% of Republicans wanting to stay the course for one to two years, compared to 51% of Democrats who wanted to stay the course for as long as it takes.\n>    \n> \n> **The Public is Divided on Level of Expenditure and Military Supplies to Ukraine**\n> \n> At the same time, the public is divided on the level of expenditure in support of Ukraine between those who say it\u2019s too much (33%) and those who say it\u2019s about the right level (30%). Only 12% said it\u2019s too little. Half of Republicans said the expenditure was too much compared to 13% of Democrats.  \n> The public was also divided about providing fighter jets and long-range missiles to Ukraine, but with more people favoring both than opposing them, and with more Democrats than Republicans favoring such supplies.    \n> \n> **There Has Been a Marked Drop in the Public Preparedness to Pay a Cost for Supporting Ukraine**\n> \n> Since March of 2022, we fielded four other polls tracking the public\u2019s willingness to pay a price in rising energy costs, higher inflation, and loss of American troops. Public support had been relatively robust, with very little change over the months ending in October 2022. But the current poll shows a marked drop on all three measures ranging from 9-15 points.  \n> \n> What explains such a drop? Perhaps the realization that there is no end in sight for the war at its first anniversary was sobering to some. But there is one variable that we have been measuring that could account for at least some of the drop. As we have shown in previous\n> polls, the degree of support for Ukraine is highly correlated with the public\u2019s evaluation of Ukraine winning or Russia losing. In the October poll, we noted stories stressing Ukrainian successes and Russian failures, which may have accounted for higher confidence in the outcome. In the newest poll, there is a marked drop in the assessment that Ukraine is winning, and Russia is losing \u2014 a drop that echoes the decline in the public\u2019s preparedness to pay a price for supporting Ukraine: Overall, the assessment that Russia is losing fell from 48% in October to 37% in April, and the assessment that Ukraine is succeeding went from 43% in October to 26% in April. It is also notable that there were parallel drops in the assessments of both Republicans and Democrats.\n> \n> It is hard to know if the change in the public\u2019s assessment of Russian and Ukrainian performance in the war may also account for the finding that only 8% of respondents said weakening or defeating Russia should be a primary U.S. priority in helping Ukraine, as we have not asked this question in prior polls.  \n> \n> It is nonetheless important to stress that the public\u2019s preparedness to support Ukraine remains highly partisan. Even with the drop in support for Ukraine since October, most Democrats remain prepared to pay a price in higher energy costs (65%) and rising inflation (60%), while only about one-third of Republicans say the same. And half of Democrats, 51%, say they are prepared to stay the course as long as it takes, even as only 25% of Republicans say the same.\n> \n> But the marked weakening of Americans\u2019 support must be concerning to U.S. policymakers. The 2024 presidential election campaign is bound to impact public attitudes on this issue given the partisan divide on Ukraine policy and in the narratives of some of the candidates. One of the critical factors will remain, however, the public perception of the unfolding battles in Ukraine itself, whether they see the tide favoring a Ukrainian victory, a Russian one, or a stalemate.",

In the newest poll, there is a marked drop in the assessment that Ukraine is winning, and Russia is losing \u2014 a drop that echoes the decline in the public\u2019s preparedness to pay a price for supporting Ukraine: Overall, the assessment that Russia is losing fell from 48% in October to 37% in April, and the assessment that Ukraine is succeeding went from 43% in October to 26% in April. It is also notable that there were parallel drops in the assessments of both Republicans and Democrats.</p>\n\n<p>It is hard to know if the change in the public\u2019s assessment of Russian and Ukrainian performance in the war may also account for the finding that only 8% of respondents said weakening or defeating Russia should be a primary U.S. priority in helping Ukraine, as we have not asked this question in prior polls.  </p>\n\n<p>It is nonetheless important to stress that the public\u2019s preparedness to support Ukraine remains highly partisan. Even with the drop in support for Ukraine since October, most Democrats remain prepared to pay a price in higher energy costs (65%) and rising inflation (60%), while only about one-third of Republicans say the same. And half of Democrats, 51%, say they are prepared to stay the course as long as it takes, even as only 25% of Republicans say the same.</p>\n\n<p>But the marked weakening of Americans\u2019 support must be concerning to U.S. policymakers. The 2024 presidential election campaign is bound to impact public attitudes on this issue given the partisan divide on Ukraine policy and in the narratives of some of the candidates. One of the critical factors will remain, however, the public perception of the unfolding battles in Ukraine itself, whether they see the tide favoring a Ukrainian victory, a Russian one, or a stalemate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",
