While that result is a success in a country where many of his factories are routinely under attack by Russian missiles, Kamyshin says he still has a long way to go.\n\n>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that we were that great for managing to increase ammunition production in three months,\u201d he said in an interview at his Kyiv office. \u201cWe produced so little in 2022.\u201d\n\n>A self-described turnaround specialist, Kamyshin now faces a business overhaul with little precedent. The 39-year-old aims to remake Ukraine\u2019s sprawling defense industry - known for decades for corruption and inefficiency - into an engine of the war effort that\u2019s deciding the fate of his country.

The latter seems to have been deployed in Berkhivka and in the Dubovo-Vasylivka salient, relieving the 200th Brigade of the Arctic fleet. Regarding VDV, let's remind that the 106th Division has been very active in Bakhmut/Soledar since January (and elements of the division were flagged in September in the area!), the 31st Brigade since May and the 11th Brigade since mid-June. \n\nAt this point just the 76th Division in Kreminna and the 7th Division on the other side of the Dnipro River in Kherson remain outside of Bakhmut (I would group the 45th Brigade in the Tokmak sector with the Spetsnaz GRU rather than the VDV). I think it has been since the push towards Kyiv that there were not so many VDV units concentrated in one place (although at the time they were far more manned and fresh). This tells us, basically, that: Russia considers Bakhmut to be a very important city that they cannot afford to lose; the loss of the city, or more realistically the flanks right now, is a possibility they consider more than realistic; they don't have (as they are deployed elsewhere) and/or don't trust for this task the other Army's brigades/regiments, let alone the mobilized units, or it would not make sense to deploy their best troops in a defensive operation, however competent they could be. This also makes me think they aren't preparing an offensive action elsewhere, with so many of their best troops concentrated in Bakhmut. Even so, it's always good to keep an eye on the Kupyansk-Svatove-Kreminna line where the formations of the Western and Central Military Districts are concentrated. The best tanks Russia can churn out seem to be destined to them - for instance, I was seeing that the 90th Tank Division has recently been equipped with a batch of T-90Ms as well as T-80BVs - an upgrade over the T-72A/Bs they fielded in 2022.\n\nBack in Bakhmut: everything is happening without huge offensive efforts from the Ukrainian side: most of the work seems to be done, judging from the videos, by the 3rd and 5th Assault Brigades and the worn-out 28th Mech in the south and the 30th Mech and 57th Motorized in the north. The 67th Mech appears to have been transferred to other sectors while brigades employed in the past months in the urban defense of Bakhmut, which suffered significant losses, such as the 93rd Mech and 77th Air Assault are still active in the area. North of Soledar, in the sector of the 10th Mountain Brigade, a battalion from the 54th Mech Brigade seems to have come down from Spirne. We are basically talking about brigades that have been active in Bakhmut since this winter: only the 22nd Mechanized among the \"new\" brigades has been identified in the area.",

Although PRC authors do not explicitly employ an ends-ways-means construct, based on their discussions we may think of strategic stability as the ends, strategic deterrence as the ways, and strategic capabilities as the means.\n\n2)PRC writings characterize the PRC\u2019s relationship with the United States as one of asymmetric strategic stability.  \nAsymmetric strategic stability is a state in which two sides with differing levels of overall strategic capabilities are nonetheless \u201cmutually vulnerable\u201d to counterattack by the other, in that neither side can prevent a retaliatory nuclear strike by the other.\n\n3) PRC writings assert that asymmetric strategic stability can only be maintained if all sides refrain from actions that undermine one another\u2019s strategic deterrent and erode mutual vulnerability.  \nMaintaining mutual vulnerability requires that the stronger side refrains from disruptive actions that undermine the weaker side\u2019s second strike capability.\n\n4) Most PRC authors argue that as a \u201cmedium\u201d nuclear power, China does not need to seek parity with \u201cgreat\u201d nuclear powers such as the US, so long as mutual vulnerability is maintained.\n\n5) Many PRC authors argue that new technologies and geostrategic dynamics mean that the PRC\u2019s previous approach to nuclear deterrence is not sustainable if the PRC wishes to maintain asymmetric strategic stability with the US. They argue that technological evolution and US actions are undermining China\u2019s second-strike capability and require a reassessment of how asymmetric strategic stability may be restored.\n\n6) PRC subject matter experts assert that the vast majority of PRC scholars and policy makers remain committed to China\u2019s NFU nuclear weapons policy.",

        "body": "With the news about Sweden likely joining NATO soon, I was curious about how that would affect Russian naval operations in the Baltic and whether Russia would want to keep a substantial fleet in the Baltic, given how unfriendly the location seems likely to be in any situation in which having a fleet there would matter. But then I noticed that Russia is also facing a similar issue in the Black Sea, especially if Ukraine ever joins NATO or gets into any sort of NATO-lite arrangement where it forms a defensive pact with Turkey. So I have a few questions if anyone wants to discuss naval affairs for a change.\n\nFirst, what's the point of the Baltic fleet?\n\nSubmarines play a unique role in terms of nuclear deterrence so obviously those retain value, but I assume putting them in the Baltic would make them quite vulnerable, and Wikipedia suggests Russia doesn't have any significant numbers of them there.\n\nFrom a defensive perspective a navy is surely useful if you have islands you need to protect, since you've gotta have a way to move things to the islands and back and protect transport ships etc. But besides islands, Ukraine seems to be able to defend its coastline very adequately without a navy, and anti-ship missiles on trucks or planes seem like they're orders of magnitude more efficient than putting them on ships. Russia doesn't have any significant islands to protect in the Baltic. Am I missing something that a navy provides from a defensive perspective?\n\nFrom a force projection perspective obviously a navy is very useful. So the Black Sea Fleet brings some value because it allows Russia to protect force into the Middle East (with Turkey's permission). But it's hard to imagine the Russian fleet projecting any force anywhere in the Baltic or anywhere close to it. It seems like any Russian ships unlucky enough to be in Kaliningrad if hostilities broke out would be bracketed by ASM 50 miles away in Poland and Estonia and gone in moments, and any ships in St. Petersburg would be penned up indefinitely and potentially attractive targets as well.\n\nSecond, how would you distribute Russia's naval assets, given the new situation in the Baltic (and arguably in the Black Sea, after Russia's invasion, which seems likely to present the same problems as the Baltic in the future)?\n\nRussia seems to face an awfully challenging strategic map because it projects naval power in the Pacific Ocean, the Arctic Ocean, the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea, and even the Caspian Sea, and it's a huge mess to move larger ships from any of these to any other, and potentially impossible if hostilities break out. (Though Russia does have inland waterways that it can move it's smaller vessels along, which connect at least the Baltic, Caspian and Black Seas.) Right now Russia seems to have what I would very roughly and probably inaccurately estimate as 40% of it's naval strength in the Arctic, 15% in the Baltic, 20% in the Pacific, 20% in the Black Sea and 5% in the Caspian again going off Wikipedia. All of the ships the size of a cruiser or larger are in the Arctic except one cruiser in the Pacific (and the Moskva). It feels to me like this distribution is a legacy of the cold war when the Arctic fleet was intended to sortie down to contest the Atlantic in WW3 and the Soviet Navy was probably dramatically stronger, but now my impression is that it's spread too thin to accomplish anything anywhere.\n\nIf I were Russia, I'd want to (1) keep the Caspian Sea Fleet about the same as it is (2) put the Kuznetsov in the Black Sea with a small escort fleet and move everything else out, on the theory that power protection against factions in the Middle East that don't have an air force is all it's good for, (3) just about entirely abandon the Baltic, (4) leave the Arctic primarily to submarines, because I don't see any surface ships reaching the Atlantic during WW3, and (5) move everything I saved from all the other areas to the Pacific where I have assets like the Kuril islands that I might conceivably have to defend, and a potentially ally in the Chinese Navy.\n\nWhat do you think?",

Heavy duty gloves or not, about every other minute someone on the working party/detail is going to need help getting unstuck from the wire. Placing wire is one of the most hated tasks in the military, digging is better. \n\nNot to mention that many Russian defenses aren't built by Ivan the Mobik infantryman, they're built by legit engineers, who are actually quite competent (RUSI says so, and they're more credible than Trelenko). \n\nThe real knock on c-wire is it's less effective against other forms of obstacles they're using (especially mines), it's bulky and can often block fields of fire (especially for grazing), its blatantly visible and gives away defensive positions when it's close to the defensive position, it isn't fast to set up so it's QUITE dangerous to be outside the defensive positions screwing around putting it up, it's really only good at slowing down enemy infantry (not stopping them), it isn't hard to get through if the attackers aren't incompetent (Bangalore torpedoes are a century plus old solution), and it'll probably be long gone from heavy HE frag prep fires before the dismounted attackers get close, especially after repeated attacks. \n\nIf you were a Russia or Ukrainian platoon leader tasked with defending and your company HQ dumps off a bunch of supplies at your position, are you going to prioritize wire or laying as many AP mines as possible in those same locations the wire would go? If your position was already hit and you need to improve it, do you sneak out to spend an hour or so laying more wire? Or do you place some more AP mines here and there, taking a few minutes, and get back in your hole before the drones spot you?",

Placing wire is one of the most hated tasks in the military, digging is better. </p>\n\n<p>Not to mention that many Russian defenses aren&#39;t built by Ivan the Mobik infantryman, they&#39;re built by legit engineers, who are actually quite competent (RUSI says so, and they&#39;re more credible than Trelenko). </p>\n\n<p>The real knock on c-wire is it&#39;s less effective against other forms of obstacles they&#39;re using (especially mines), it&#39;s bulky and can often block fields of fire (especially for grazing), its blatantly visible and gives away defensive positions when it&#39;s close to the defensive position, it isn&#39;t fast to set up so it&#39;s QUITE dangerous to be outside the defensive positions screwing around putting it up, it&#39;s really only good at slowing down enemy infantry (not stopping them), it isn&#39;t hard to get through if the attackers aren&#39;t incompetent (Bangalore torpedoes are a century plus old solution), and it&#39;ll probably be long gone from heavy HE frag prep fires before the dismounted attackers get close, especially after repeated attacks. </p>\n\n<p>If you were a Russia or Ukrainian platoon leader tasked with defending and your company HQ dumps off a bunch of supplies at your position, are you going to prioritize wire or laying as many AP mines as possible in those same locations the wire would go? If your position was already hit and you need to improve it, do you sneak out to spend an hour or so laying more wire? Or do you place some more AP mines here and there, taking a few minutes, and get back in your hole before the drones spot you?</p>\n</div>",

Sall was joined on the trip by his counterparts from South Africa, Zambia and representatives from Uganda, Egypt, Republic of Congo and the African Union.\u201cBefore the next Russia-Africa summit, he \\[Putin\\] must do some actions to show his desire to move forward \\[with peace\\] even in a humanitarian way,\u201d Sall told the FT in the presidential palace in Dakar, the Senegalese capital.\n\nIt sounds as though the African delegation may have been more than a little fed up with Putin after their meeting in June. That statement would have come on the heels of the Russians launching missile strikes on Kyiv while the African delegation was there talking to Zelensky. The general narrative a lot of Russia-leaning observers seem to push is that the Global South is mostly ok with Russia's war because they need Russia. There's definitely an idea in circulation that there's a tacit approval of Russia's behavior as a \"stand against the West\" sort of thing. But that honestly does not seem to be the case. If anything, I'd say that Russia seems to be fumbling the bag diplomatically, especially when it comes to these smaller states. Putin basically wheeled them out in Moscow for optics then told them to kick rocks (after launching missile strikes near them). The African delegation outside of South Africa genuinely seems exasperated and frustrated with the dismissive treatment they received. If Putin really is trying to set Russia up as the champion of the non-Western world, treating these countries so dismissively is not going to do much to help the cause, especially given that China and India remain at arm's length. These African countries are tied to Russia economically due to the need for agricultural supplies, but in a very stereotypically Russian fashion I feel like Putin misinterprets that dependency as loyalty/deference, not just a necessity. You'd think the UN vote would have reflected that, but the Russians have generally \"might makes right\" viewpoint and probably assume most of those votes in the UN were for show, not actually reflective of a country's views. South Africa remains the stand out of course because they view their membership in the BRICS as essential to their global standing and being the foremost African state, so they'll hold on to Russia to the hilt, hence the recent military exercises, but other African countries are going to sour if they're not accorded some level of acknowledgement or receptiveness for their efforts to negotiate.",

I am mentioning this specifically because the German marine infantry is (as far as I know) supposed to be integrated with the Dutch forces soon(ish). It will be interesting to see how such an exercise would go if that has been fully implemented. Would they still be able to participate independently I wonder?</p>\n</div>",

Troops from the UN Interim Force in Lebanon \u2014 or UNIFIL \u2014 are stationed there to make sure both sides keep to the rules.\n\n>Yet in the past year, Israeli military officials say, those outposts have sprung up along the Blue Line, the boundary set by the UN. Whereas Hezbollah fighters have long entered the area disguised as civilians, some now wear uniforms and openly carry weapons, said the Israeli officials, who were not authorized to speak publicly. \n\n>One is said to have ventured 60 kilometers into Israel and set off a bomb, injuring a civilian.\n\n> Requests for comment from Hezbollah and the Lebanese Armed Forces went unanswered.\n\n>\u201cDuring the past year Hezbollah has erected at least 27 new military outposts along the Blue Line,\u201d Israel\u2019s ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan, wrote in a late June letter to the Security Council. \u201cSince the construction of these outposts there has been a significant increase of friction and incidents, initiated by Hezbollah\u2019s operatives.\u201d \n\n>\u201cHezbollah systematically deprives UNIFIL of its ability to implement its core missions, in order to assure that its military build-up continues unhindered in Southern Lebanon,\u201d he said.\n\n>>>But Israel, too, violates the UN resolution.\n\n> According to a UN document from March, Israeli aircraft flew over the Blue Line on 182 occasions between Nov. 3 and Feb. 20 and the country occupies the northern portion of Ghajar, a town that straddles the line. Hezbollah said in recent weeks it had shot down an Israeli drone over south Lebanon.\n\n>> Escalating Tensions\n\n>The developments are just one sign of escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, a nation emboldened by a string of diplomatic breakthroughs including a military alliance with Russia and the restoration of diplomatic ties with Saudi Arabia. Signs even emerged in recent weeks of a potential informal understanding between Tehran and the US, which could lead to Iran voluntarily limiting its nuclear program in return for allowances to ship more crude oil.\n\n> In contrast, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is on the back foot over protests against plans to overhaul the judiciary and last week\u2019s intense fighting in the West Bank, which killed 12 Palestinians and one Israeli soldier.\n\n>> Border Snapshot \n\n>A visit to the border accompanied by Israeli military officers illustrates just how close Hezbollah fighters and installations appear to be.\n\n>From the roof of an Israeli army border base, a wide green panorama with a red-roofed Lebanese village and Israeli farmland stretches into the distance toward the Hermon mountain range.\n\n>Just over the border is a container the officers describe as a Hezbollah military installation. Two people stand on top, snapping photographs of the Israeli side. After a few minutes, a van pulls up on the Lebanon side, and half a dozen men get out. The group walks over to the roof of a nearby building. The officer in charge of the installation walks closer. The two sides stare at each other.\n\n> \u201cAny presence or activity on the north side of the Blue Line not belonging to UNIFIL or the Lebanese Armed Forces is a concern,\u201d Kandace Ardiel, a spokesperson, said. \u201cPeacekeepers must have full freedom of movement along the Blue Line and throughout our area of operations.\u201d\n\n>A UN report from March says despite repeated requests, \u201cUNIFIL has yet to gain full access to several locations of interest.\u201d\n\n>Israel is increasingly concerned about Iranian activities, and not just in Lebanon. Last week, the Israeli military raided a refugee camp in Jenin, its biggest such incursion into the West Bank in two decades. Part of the goal was destroying weapons-production sites it says were controlled by Iran-funded terrorists.\n\n>On Thursday, a rocket was launched from Lebanon at Israel, and the Israeli military struck back.\n\n>>Fully-Fledged Military\n\n>Hezbollah, funded mostly by Iran and thought to have more than 100,000 rockets and missiles at its disposal, would be certain to play a role in any bigger conflict. Israeli officials speculate the group has been encouraged by the return to Lebanon of personnel who fought in Syria, who have transformed the group from a guerrilla outfit to a fully-fledged military organization with professional soldiers.\n\n>Israeli officials say that as Lebanon declines further into one of the worst economic and financial crises in history, Hezbollah is getting more powerful.

            "body": "Big libertarian names were funded by Russia already in the naughts. The rest is a **text dump I got from reddit ~7 years ago:**\n(N.b. I think Dugin is mostly a joke, a random guy the West really focused on although 1000 others have the same ideas, others with influence... I mean, look at him:  https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RQ70N1p3S1s/maxresdefault.jpg )\n\n-----------\n\nEkim Alptekin did pay Flynn $530,000 to lobby the Trump admin on Turkey's behalf. That came out a week ago, and it is just fact. Nobody disputes it. Trump had already fired Flynn, and said it was the first he learned of it. Flynn had already been caught and fired for lying to Pence, but came out and told the truth in the end. Even Ekim put it up on his Twitter, although he is making the argument that he would have paid Podesta if he wanted influence in the Whitehouse, not Flynn, and that he funneled that Turkish govenrment money through Inovo to Flynn for some other reason.\n\nSo is that the Turkish government paying Flynn to act on their behalf? Yes. 100%. Does that prove the goal is to destabilize the US or that they were working in concert with the Russians? No. That part I am not certain of.\n\nBut does K. Ekim Alptekin belong to a common board and a common organization as V. Ergin Imre? Certainly. Is V. Ergin Imre one of the wealthiest men in Turkey with extensive business interests in Russia. Also proven yes. Is he also the brother-in-law of Hans Hermann Hoppe? Also proven yes. Has Hoppe suddenly for the past few years had ample funding to fly alt right characters to have one big party in Turkey in a hotel owned by V. Ergin Imre where he busses in everything from hired women to martini waterfalls and DJs? Yup. Undeniable. Is Richard Spencer repeatedly a guest at these things? Yes. Is Peter Thiel also a guest at these things? Yes. So are a lot of people. Whatever. It is a conference, even if a weird one. So I can prove all those connections exist. The marriages, the money, the people meeting together, the active merger of anarcho-capitalists and white nationalists. What I cannot prove is that the money actively comes from the Turkish government, nor can I prove that is being used for the purposes of destabilizing the US.\n\nBut I can prove that the Russian government funds the anti-global initiative and Dugin's Eurasian and Identitarian Movements. And I can prove that Dugin has 47 physical Eurasian Movement locations, and that they are only located in Russia, Poland and Turkey. And I can prove that Richard Spencer calls himself an Identitarian. And I can prove that he and other identitarians attend Hoppe's Turkey meeting. And I can prove that he and other Identitiarians attend similar meetings in Moscow that are funded by the Kremlin. Can I definitively prove why the Kremlin is funding these people? No, I can't. Not any more than I can definitively prove why they give money to Marine Le Pen or the P-IRA or the Catalan Independence or Calexit guys. But they do. And it's documented. So they are up to something. Am I 100% sure the goal is to destabilize the US and EU? Like I said, no.\n\n...\n\nIn 2013 Dugin's movement took part in annual Kremlin's youth meetings where one could see Donetsk People Republic representatives, at that time - just a bunch of young freaks from Donetsk nobody ever heard about, but they already had a flag which is official DPR flag now: http://i.imgur.com/PabFDi2.jpg\n\nIt was one of scenarios prepared by Kremlin since 2005 (first Ukranian pro-West anti-Russian coup). And when the moment came, Putin used that scenario. Dugin had always been partly responsible/executive for it. He also has some ties with Turkey which could help resolve that conflict between Russia and Turkey, but it still has nothing to do with Dugin as a mastermind though. Dugin is a sincere idealist. And his ideals are Eurasinism and Russian World form Far East to the center of Europe (which sounds like Pinky and Brain's level of thinking).\n\n...\n\nWhat I'm finding points specifically to one think tank, the Ludwig von Mises Institute, and more specifically to a couple of members there, namely Hans Hermann Hoppe and Paul Gottfried.\n\n    If Hoppe wants to disassociate himself and anarcho-capitalism from the Alt-Right, he probably should stop inviting alt-right leaders to parties and boat-rides he hosts in Turkey. Hoppe's keynote speech at the Property and Freedom Society last fall was literally titled \"Libertarianism and the \u201cAlt-Right\u201d.\" I'm not making this stuff up. He is.\n\nhttp://propertyandfreedom.org/\n\nIt's actually not just far-right groups I find evidence of Russia and Turkey supporting. In the USA it is primarily far-right groups. But even in the US there are also left-groups like Calexit, which Russia seems to pay to help promote in very much the same way. And in Spain and Ireland, they actually fund some socialist separatist groups. Again, I hypothesize that their goal is to destabilize the US and the EU enough that they can expand their local influence. But my point is, the lefties on Calexit hate me for this just as much as you do. Go ahead and try to tell them that their movement is being led by a dude in Moscow and funded by fascist groups in Russia, including one called \"Fuck the USA!\" They just don't want to hear it. But it's true.\n\nhttp://www.snopes.com/2017/01/30/calexit-campaign-supported-russia/\n\nWho knew Hans Hermann Hoppe married a Turk, moved to Turkey, and became brother-in-law with a guy who sits on a board with the guy who funneled $530,000 through a Dutch consulting firm to General Flynn to advance the Turkish Government's interests in the Trump Administration? Until the article broke last week, even Trump supposedly didn't know Flynn got that money. So this is brand new. And Flynn, remember, just got fired for lying about ties to Russia.\n\nhttps://www.google.com/search?client=opera&q=flynn+530000&sourceid=opera&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8\n\nAnd who ties Turkey and Russia together recently? Dugin...the man who claims he saved the regime from the coup by tipping off President Erdogan. I mean, the Chicago Tribune pieced at least that part together. \n\nhttp://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-dugin-trump-putin-turkey-20170203-story.html\n\nBut they didn't seem to grasp that Dugin's English translator is Richard Spencer's Russian Wife. Nor did they seem to grasp that Spencer and Miller hung around Duke together for years...they just try to jam Bannon into that role, where maybe he fits ideologically, but there doesn't seem to be any personal connections.\n\nSo, anyways, all I'm trying to do is see the forrest through the trees and connect the dots here. Even if I am right, and the Russian and Turkish governments are funding some of this stuff, that doesn't mean it's necessarily illegal. Nor does it mean I understand exactly the extent the operations go to...e.g. Do they help with SEO and popularizing mises.org online? Are any of these foreign wives actually foreign intelligence agents or are none? How do they go about selecting the groups they want to fund, and how much total funding do they give out? Why do they make it so obvious as to bring these people directly to Russia and Turkey? Is it to try to compromise them there? Wouldn't it be less suspicious, cheaper, and easier to just hold the meeting in London or New York or even Berlin or something?\n\nI don't have the answers to any of those questions even if I'm right, and I'm not 100% sure I am. So I'm just watching this story, because it's one that we will find out more about, but that is just unfolding now...not one that it 10 or 20 years old that we already know the outcome to...\n\nHHH's brother in law, V. Ergin Imre, runs the Ahmet Veli Menger Holding Company and is on the Board of Directors of Enka, the largest construction firm in Turkey.\n\nEnka, in turn, has various connections to Moscow, the biggest being the the Riverside Towers on the Eastern Tip of Kremlin Island. The main shareholders of Riverside Towers are ENKA Holding and the Moscow City Government.\n\nAnyways, beyond those new connections, this slightly older Chicago Tribune article http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-dugin-trump-putin-turkey-20170203-story.html draws out the connections between Trump, the Von Mises Institute (at least through Paul Gottfried) https://mises.org/profile/paul-gottfried , Russia, Turkey and that Russian fascist Dugin I was talking a lot about in my longer post very well. http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-dugin-trump-putin-turkey-20170203-story.html\n\nThey haven't put together the Hans Hermann Hoppe part of it yet, but since he and Gottfried shared office space in the same small building at the same small institute in the same small town in Alabama, we know there's a direct connection there. And we know Gottfried now gets published by Arkos and wrote the forward to Dugin's book. And we know Richard Spencer (the heil trump guy) is married to the Russian woman who translated Dugin's book.\n\nI think a lot of the living ancap superstars--and particularly the LVMI--are going to get tied right up in this odd Russian/Turkish/Alt-Right scandal that's brewing.\n\n\nLvMI is sort of a transistor for libertarians and the alt-right. Turkey is the same, but on a giant scale.\n\nNominally European, but really an underground railroad for Euroskeptics, monarchists, and Putin apologists.",

I mean, look at him:  <a href=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RQ70N1p3S1s/maxresdefault.jpg\">https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RQ70N1p3S1s/maxresdefault.jpg</a> )</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Ekim Alptekin did pay Flynn $530,000 to lobby the Trump admin on Turkey&#39;s behalf. That came out a week ago, and it is just fact. Nobody disputes it. Trump had already fired Flynn, and said it was the first he learned of it. Flynn had already been caught and fired for lying to Pence, but came out and told the truth in the end. Even Ekim put it up on his Twitter, although he is making the argument that he would have paid Podesta if he wanted influence in the Whitehouse, not Flynn, and that he funneled that Turkish govenrment money through Inovo to Flynn for some other reason.</p>\n\n<p>So is that the Turkish government paying Flynn to act on their behalf? Yes. 100%. Does that prove the goal is to destabilize the US or that they were working in concert with the Russians? No. That part I am not certain of.</p>\n\n<p>But does K. Ekim Alptekin belong to a common board and a common organization as V. Ergin Imre? Certainly. Is V. Ergin Imre one of the wealthiest men in Turkey with extensive business interests in Russia. Also proven yes. Is he also the brother-in-law of Hans Hermann Hoppe? Also proven yes. Has Hoppe suddenly for the past few years had ample funding to fly alt right characters to have one big party in Turkey in a hotel owned by V. Ergin Imre where he busses in everything from hired women to martini waterfalls and DJs? Yup. Undeniable. Is Richard Spencer repeatedly a guest at these things? Yes. Is Peter Thiel also a guest at these things? Yes. So are a lot of people. Whatever. It is a conference, even if a weird one. So I can prove all those connections exist. The marriages, the money, the people meeting together, the active merger of anarcho-capitalists and white nationalists. What I cannot prove is that the money actively comes from the Turkish government, nor can I prove that is being used for the purposes of destabilizing the US.</p>\n\n<p>But I can prove that the Russian government funds the anti-global initiative and Dugin&#39;s Eurasian and Identitarian Movements. And I can prove that Dugin has 47 physical Eurasian Movement locations, and that they are only located in Russia, Poland and Turkey. And I can prove that Richard Spencer calls himself an Identitarian. And I can prove that he and other identitarians attend Hoppe&#39;s Turkey meeting. And I can prove that he and other Identitiarians attend similar meetings in Moscow that are funded by the Kremlin. Can I definitively prove why the Kremlin is funding these people? No, I can&#39;t. Not any more than I can definitively prove why they give money to Marine Le Pen or the P-IRA or the Catalan Independence or Calexit guys. But they do. And it&#39;s documented. So they are up to something. Am I 100% sure the goal is to destabilize the US and EU? Like I said, no.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>In 2013 Dugin&#39;s movement took part in annual Kremlin&#39;s youth meetings where one could see Donetsk People Republic representatives, at that time - just a bunch of young freaks from Donetsk nobody ever heard about, but they already had a flag which is official DPR flag now: <a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/PabFDi2.jpg\">http://i.imgur.com/PabFDi2.jpg</a></p>\n\n<p>It was one of scenarios prepared by Kremlin since 2005 (first Ukranian pro-West anti-Russian coup). And when the moment came, Putin used that scenario. Dugin had always been partly responsible/executive for it. He also has some ties with Turkey which could help resolve that conflict between Russia and Turkey, but it still has nothing to do with Dugin as a mastermind though. Dugin is a sincere idealist. And his ideals are Eurasinism and Russian World form Far East to the center of Europe (which sounds like Pinky and Brain&#39;s level of thinking).</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>What I&#39;m finding points specifically to one think tank, the Ludwig von Mises Institute, and more specifically to a couple of members there, namely Hans Hermann Hoppe and Paul Gottfried.</p>\n\n<pre><code>If Hoppe wants to disassociate himself and anarcho-capitalism from the Alt-Right, he probably should stop inviting alt-right leaders to parties and boat-rides he hosts in Turkey. Hoppe&#39;s keynote speech at the Property and Freedom Society last fall was literally titled &quot;Libertarianism and the \u201cAlt-Right\u201d.&quot; I&#39;m not making this stuff up. He is.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://propertyandfreedom.org/\">http://propertyandfreedom.org/</a></p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s actually not just far-right groups I find evidence of Russia and Turkey supporting. In the USA it is primarily far-right groups. But even in the US there are also left-groups like Calexit, which Russia seems to pay to help promote in very much the same way. And in Spain and Ireland, they actually fund some socialist separatist groups. Again, I hypothesize that their goal is to destabilize the US and the EU enough that they can expand their local influence. But my point is, the lefties on Calexit hate me for this just as much as you do. Go ahead and try to tell them that their movement is being led by a dude in Moscow and funded by fascist groups in Russia, including one called &quot;Fuck the USA!&quot; They just don&#39;t want to hear it. But it&#39;s true.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/2017/01/30/calexit-campaign-supported-russia/\">http://www.snopes.com/2017/01/30/calexit-campaign-supported-russia/</a></p>\n\n<p>Who knew Hans Hermann Hoppe married a Turk, moved to Turkey, and became brother-in-law with a guy who sits on a board with the guy who funneled $530,000 through a Dutch consulting firm to General Flynn to advance the Turkish Government&#39;s interests in the Trump Administration? Until the article broke last week, even Trump supposedly didn&#39;t know Flynn got that money. So this is brand new. And Flynn, remember, just got fired for lying about ties to Russia.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?client=opera&amp;q=flynn+530000&amp;sourceid=opera&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8\">https://www.google.com/search?client=opera&amp;q=flynn+530000&amp;sourceid=opera&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8</a></p>\n\n<p>And who ties Turkey and Russia together recently? Dugin...the man who claims he saved the regime from the coup by tipping off President Erdogan. I mean, the Chicago Tribune pieced at least that part together. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-dugin-trump-putin-turkey-20170203-story.html\">http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-dugin-trump-putin-turkey-20170203-story.html</a></p>\n\n<p>But they didn&#39;t seem to grasp that Dugin&#39;s English translator is Richard Spencer&#39;s Russian Wife. Nor did they seem to grasp that Spencer and Miller hung around Duke together for years...they just try to jam Bannon into that role, where maybe he fits ideologically, but there doesn&#39;t seem to be any personal connections.</p>\n\n<p>So, anyways, all I&#39;m trying to do is see the forrest through the trees and connect the dots here. Even if I am right, and the Russian and Turkish governments are funding some of this stuff, that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s necessarily illegal. Nor does it mean I understand exactly the extent the operations go to...e.g. Do they help with SEO and popularizing mises.org online? Are any of these foreign wives actually foreign intelligence agents or are none? How do they go about selecting the groups they want to fund, and how much total funding do they give out? Why do they make it so obvious as to bring these people directly to Russia and Turkey? Is it to try to compromise them there? Wouldn&#39;t it be less suspicious, cheaper, and easier to just hold the meeting in London or New York or even Berlin or something?</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t have the answers to any of those questions even if I&#39;m right, and I&#39;m not 100% sure I am. So I&#39;m just watching this story, because it&#39;s one that we will find out more about, but that is just unfolding now...not one that it 10 or 20 years old that we already know the outcome to...</p>\n\n<p>HHH&#39;s brother in law, V. Ergin Imre, runs the Ahmet Veli Menger Holding Company and is on the Board of Directors of Enka, the largest construction firm in Turkey.</p>\n\n<p>Enka, in turn, has various connections to Moscow, the biggest being the the Riverside Towers on the Eastern Tip of Kremlin Island. The main shareholders of Riverside Towers are ENKA Holding and the Moscow City Government.</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, beyond those new connections, this slightly older Chicago Tribune article <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-dugin-trump-putin-turkey-20170203-story.html\">http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-dugin-trump-putin-turkey-20170203-story.html</a> draws out the connections between Trump, the Von Mises Institute (at least through Paul Gottfried) <a href=\"https://mises.org/profile/paul-gottfried\">https://mises.org/profile/paul-gottfried</a> , Russia, Turkey and that Russian fascist Dugin I was talking a lot about in my longer post very well. <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-dugin-trump-putin-turkey-20170203-story.html\">http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-dugin-trump-putin-turkey-20170203-story.html</a></p>\n\n<p>They haven&#39;t put together the Hans Hermann Hoppe part of it yet, but since he and Gottfried shared office space in the same small building at the same small institute in the same small town in Alabama, we know there&#39;s a direct connection there. And we know Gottfried now gets published by Arkos and wrote the forward to Dugin&#39;s book. And we know Richard Spencer (the heil trump guy) is married to the Russian woman who translated Dugin&#39;s book.</p>\n\n<p>I think a lot of the living ancap superstars--and particularly the LVMI--are going to get tied right up in this odd Russian/Turkish/Alt-Right scandal that&#39;s brewing.</p>\n\n<p>LvMI is sort of a transistor for libertarians and the alt-right. Turkey is the same, but on a giant scale.</p>\n\n<p>Nominally European, but really an underground railroad for Euroskeptics, monarchists, and Putin apologists.</p>\n</div>",

            "body": ">Is it similar to how they infiltrated many left wing groups during the Cold War ?\n\nThis kind of subversive operation has been going on literally since the 1950s. The Russians pivoted to this when they realized that the Americans had, in the 1940s, basically blown up their entire spying apparatus in North America. Check out some of the reporting on the Venona papers from the FBI, wild stuff. We were reading the majority of diplomatic cables sent from the US to Moscow because, stupidly enough, Russia was sending them via undersea cables that all had their outlet in NYC Harbor. \n\nAfter the collapse of the espionage branch of Russian intel inthe US, they shifted to political influence. Actually that occurred even before the collapse, as we see in the election of 1948. The CPUSA, which we know thanks to Venona was taking direction from Moscow and the NKVD, was ordered in 1944 to switch from cooperation with the American leftwing to subversion. After the way they infiltrated and took over a number of unions on the west coast, essentially killing them. Actually most of the wartime Democratic politicos gained a pretty deep hatred of Communists because of this. Hubert Humphrey complained later that in 1944 and 1945 a whole army of Communists who refused to say there were Communists took control over several unions he helped organize, and banned non-Communist membership effectively destroying the groups. Then in 1948 did the same to the Progressive Party's campaign led by definitely not a communist, Henry Wallace. Ironically this basically destroyed his campaign, not because most people found out about the hidden communist influence (though the FBI clearly did know) but because his Communist supporters were *so incompetent* that instead of campaigning they tried to convert other members of his campaign staff to their hidden Communist cabal. Members who were already on the take for *other* Russian intel agencies. There are several instances in which NKVD/KGB agents were trying to sound out the leanings of people on the take for the GRU. \n\nAnyway once the harder espionage stuff unraveled the Soviets experienced a period where spy recruitment was next to impossible. Executing the Rosenbergs will have that effect I suppose. The result was that the KGB and GRU would focus on leftwing infiltration and subversion, but it didn't go much better through the 1960s and 70s than it had in the 1940s. The people who were attracted to Soviet-type Communism were typically the people on the outer fringes, loners, people with not a lot of connection to the US system. Lee Harvey Oswald is the perfect example of this. Just a pissed off guy with nothing to lose. In a Joan Baez novel on the '60s you also see in SF that despite the strong countercultural element, the CPUSA struggled. The hierarchical and rather traditional Soviet approach to communism wasn't really appealing to the counter-cultural undertones of the Hippies, even if they preached their own communalism. Ditto with the Civil Rights Movement where you see some attempts at contacting key black leaders. But black leaders were smart enough to realize that getting in bed with the Russian would kill their movement here and quickly cut off ties when they figured out the game. The big exception there being WEB Du Bois who eventually emigrated to Moscow and as a result was basically ostracized from the movement. \n\nWhere you ironically *do* see success in infiltrating American movements was not with Soviet/Russian led Communism, but Mao-ism and East Asian communism. The Civil Rights movement was smart enough not to play with the Russians, but there was a real and strong connection with the Chinese. It was thought that there was solidarity between black exploitation in the US and Chinese exploitation during the 'century of humiliation' (though I dont think that term was then in use?) Likewise, a ton of bilateral exchange between the peace movement and the NLF in North Vietnam. I think this highlights, the '68ers weren't opposed to Communism.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>Is it similar to how they infiltrated many left wing groups during the Cold War ?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This kind of subversive operation has been going on literally since the 1950s. The Russians pivoted to this when they realized that the Americans had, in the 1940s, basically blown up their entire spying apparatus in North America. Check out some of the reporting on the Venona papers from the FBI, wild stuff. We were reading the majority of diplomatic cables sent from the US to Moscow because, stupidly enough, Russia was sending them via undersea cables that all had their outlet in NYC Harbor. </p>\n\n<p>After the collapse of the espionage branch of Russian intel inthe US, they shifted to political influence. Actually that occurred even before the collapse, as we see in the election of 1948. The CPUSA, which we know thanks to Venona was taking direction from Moscow and the NKVD, was ordered in 1944 to switch from cooperation with the American leftwing to subversion. After the way they infiltrated and took over a number of unions on the west coast, essentially killing them. Actually most of the wartime Democratic politicos gained a pretty deep hatred of Communists because of this. Hubert Humphrey complained later that in 1944 and 1945 a whole army of Communists who refused to say there were Communists took control over several unions he helped organize, and banned non-Communist membership effectively destroying the groups. Then in 1948 did the same to the Progressive Party&#39;s campaign led by definitely not a communist, Henry Wallace. Ironically this basically destroyed his campaign, not because most people found out about the hidden communist influence (though the FBI clearly did know) but because his Communist supporters were <em>so incompetent</em> that instead of campaigning they tried to convert other members of his campaign staff to their hidden Communist cabal. Members who were already on the take for <em>other</em> Russian intel agencies. There are several instances in which NKVD/KGB agents were trying to sound out the leanings of people on the take for the GRU. </p>\n\n<p>Anyway once the harder espionage stuff unraveled the Soviets experienced a period where spy recruitment was next to impossible. Executing the Rosenbergs will have that effect I suppose. The result was that the KGB and GRU would focus on leftwing infiltration and subversion, but it didn&#39;t go much better through the 1960s and 70s than it had in the 1940s. The people who were attracted to Soviet-type Communism were typically the people on the outer fringes, loners, people with not a lot of connection to the US system. Lee Harvey Oswald is the perfect example of this. Just a pissed off guy with nothing to lose. In a Joan Baez novel on the &#39;60s you also see in SF that despite the strong countercultural element, the CPUSA struggled. The hierarchical and rather traditional Soviet approach to communism wasn&#39;t really appealing to the counter-cultural undertones of the Hippies, even if they preached their own communalism. Ditto with the Civil Rights Movement where you see some attempts at contacting key black leaders. But black leaders were smart enough to realize that getting in bed with the Russian would kill their movement here and quickly cut off ties when they figured out the game. The big exception there being WEB Du Bois who eventually emigrated to Moscow and as a result was basically ostracized from the movement. </p>\n\n<p>Where you ironically <em>do</em> see success in infiltrating American movements was not with Soviet/Russian led Communism, but Mao-ism and East Asian communism. The Civil Rights movement was smart enough not to play with the Russians, but there was a real and strong connection with the Chinese. It was thought that there was solidarity between black exploitation in the US and Chinese exploitation during the &#39;century of humiliation&#39; (though I dont think that term was then in use?) Likewise, a ton of bilateral exchange between the peace movement and the NLF in North Vietnam. I think this highlights, the &#39;68ers weren&#39;t opposed to Communism. Many were down with Marx, Lenin, and Mao. But the force of the Cold War did seem to work (alongside very active counterintelligence measures conducted by the Hoover FBI, and some phenomenal cryptographic work) in driving a wedge between the New Left and the Soviets. </p>\n\n<p>Of course in Europe this story is also totally different, and solidarity among western leftwing movements could produce some contamination that way as well.</p>\n</div>",

Doing so is expensive both in terms of time and Ukrainian lives.\n\nProbably also worth noting that they can target the DPICMs along the flanks of their axis of advance while reserving unitary warhead ammunition for the trenches they intend to directly assault with dismounted infantry. The western 155mm artillery they are using is more than accurate enough to support that approach. Or if they do drop DPICMs on the specific trenches they plan to assault, they will be advancing with tanks and IFVs that are more than capable of shrugging the blast from such a small warhead off, especially from their undersides, which are armored against much larger AT mines. \n\nAnd even dismounted I don't think the duds will pose such an enormous hazard, at least not relative to the already very substantial hazards which a breaching assault against strong enemy fortifications entails. Actual dud rates are subject to a lot of debate, but even assuming a relatively high 10%, we should only expect 8.8 duds per DPICM round. Assuming a 1km stretch of the front that is 500m deep, the UAF need to cover around 500,000m^2 of fortifications, while each M42 submunition can cover around 10m^2 on the ground. Assuming they are not dropped from a height that will result in either denser, overlapping coverage or less dense, less complete coverage, that means they would need around 568 DPICMs rounds to cover 100% of the targeted section of the frontline, which would likely include around 5000 duds at a 10% dud rate (I'm being a little lazy and rounding down to an even number to make the math simpler, but you get the idea). Assuming a perfectly uniform distribution of duds over the target area (which would result in a grid like pattern), you could expect a dud on the ground about every 100m. Obviously reality will depart dramatically from that idealized version, but it gives you a sense of scale of the dud density at least.\n\nSo not exactly a dense AP minefield, but perhaps enough to make the UAF troops exercise a little more caution while dismounted. Although it's likely they would already be exercising immense caution in anticipation of defensive enemy action during an assault, so I'm not sure it really would affect their assault tactics in any meaningful way. The effect may be somewhat asymmetric in their favor because the Russian troops will not know where the duds are either, which reduces their informational advantage from knowing the local geography in detail over the attackers. Since normally they have a much better idea of where everything is around their positions, including supporting or fallback defensive positions, existing minefields, sight lines, booby traps, etc. So basically it makes the Russians be as cautious in their defensive movements as the Ukrainians need to be on the assault anyway, which is a net win for the Ukrainians.",

When the round dispenses the submunitions they're on nylon strings and spun out with centrifugal force pulling the string, which pulls the slide out of the way and arms the submunition. The on in impact, the inertia of the pin allows it to overcome the spring and strike the primer.\n\nSo a dud is a submunition where either that slide didn't move out of the way, or the impact didn't hit the pin hard enough. In no way does this mean that the dud is now inert or unlikely to be triggered if handled. Simply picking up the submunition and shaking it around too violently could potentially trigger it. Or putting it in the back of a truck that goes bouncing down the road. Etc. Basically I wouldn't want to bet that stepping on one of these things is harmless.",
