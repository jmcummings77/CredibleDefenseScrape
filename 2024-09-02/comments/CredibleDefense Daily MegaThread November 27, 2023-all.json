      "selftext": "The r/CredibleDefense daily megathread is for asking questions and posting submissions that would not fit the criteria of our post submissions. As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster. Don't abuse it though! If something is not obviously against the rules but you still feel that it should be reviewed, leave a short but descriptive comment while filing the report.",

        "body": "I had previously intended this as a reply to a comment but it got out of hand and now it's more or less just a contextual aid for the challenges Ukraine is currently facing and likely to face in electrical generation and transmission.\n\nApologies for the length, if you're not into this relatively dry conversational topic and discussion of Ukrainian substations doesn't turn you on (I'll show myself out) then feel free to scroll past.\n\nI figured some people might find it useful with the likely upcoming winter \"electrical offensive\". There seems to be a lot of discussion on the particulars of this so hopefully this can be helpful to anyone interested!\n\n-------\n\nUkraine is in for a really rough ride this winter if Russia has the missile and drone inventory to push home their advantage and head start on the Ukrainian energy grid, and for those glancing at this as alarmist, I'll explain some stats and information below that reveals a pretty bleak reality... Not intending to \"doompost\" but it's good to know the specific challenges that the Ukrainian power grid is likely going to face this winter if Russia chooses to renew its focus.\n\nRussia has been focused on three methods of energy denial, the first being the **cutting of high voltage lines between occupied regions and Ukrainian held territories**, resulting in a 10GW drop (From 36GW) in total production, 6GW of that capacity being from the Zaporizhia Nuclear power plant alone. In 2022 this accounted for 45% of the reduction in electrical production capacity. This however was a one time hit, Russia cannot cut these lines again and so this method is no longer worth discussing.\n\nThe next and arguably most well known method has been the **destruction of Ukrainian high voltage substations**, these are the energy distribution backbone of the entire country and without these Ukrainian electricity production cannot be distributed between regions and used to relieve peak demand. The disruption and destruction of these substations caused significant rolling blackouts in the last winter offensive.\n\nThe third and (to me at least) far less discussed method has been the **destruction, damage and occupation of Thermal Power Plants**, these include Coal, Oil and Gas fired power plants. Ukraine classes these power plants under an umbrella term (TPP) and these have seen a significant reduction in available capacity as the war has dragged on and damaged plants have largely remained unrepaired.\n\n---------\n**The destruction of High Voltage substations.**\n---------\n\n\nUkraine Pre-War had approximately **141 \"High Voltage Substations\"**. In the first 3 months of the war Ukraine had already lost 10 of these substations. **Only 94** of these high voltage substations remained in Ukrainian hands leading into the Russian winter offensive against their energy grid.\n\nThe majority of these substations are anywhere between 330kV and 750kV (As of 2013, 88 of these substations were 330kV and 8 were 750kV, these numbers may have slightly changed by the war, there was a new power line connecting Rivne NPP and Kyiv and there was a Pre-War substation addition for ZNPP which potentially added 1-2 new 750kV substations, but regardless the numbers will not have substantially changed.\n\nThe Ukrainian power grid is nearly wholly reliant on 750kV transmission substations. These are very expensive substations with individual transformers sometimes weighing over 200 tonnes, they're also very difficult to replace and repair. These substations are vital for moving electricity between regions and exporting electricity produced by power plants into the wider grid, particularly electricity generated by Ukraine's Nuclear Power Plants. This is especially important as many of Ukraine's largest cities, including Kyiv, rely upon electricity imported via 750kV transmission lines.\n\nThese 750kV substations are a holdover from the old Soviet transmission systems, replacing them has been talked about in the press over the last year or so but realistically speaking any widespread energy grid replacement would be measured in a decade or more, it's not worth talking about in terms of this conflict and its outcomes. New 750kV transformers have a production lead time of more than a year per unit and represent the single largest constraint for Ukraine in terms of being able to maintain it's transmission grid.\n\nDuring the winter campaign things considerably worsened as Russia focused most of its efforts toward knocking out these high voltage substations. **41/94 (43%) were damaged, sometimes heavily, or outright destroyed by April of 2023.** More than half of these substations have been hit more than once further exacerbating the damage.\n\n**Ukrenergo claims that 67% of the damaged substations have been repaired or partially repaired**, if this claim is accurate then 28 of the damaged 41 substations are operational again, **leaving 13 substations still completely out of action**. Ukraine is going into the winter with 81 high voltage transmission substations with a further 28 substations (35%) in some state of potential disrepair/limited capacity due to prior damage.\n\nIf Russia turns up the heat and see's the same level of success it saw last year (notably a 43% knockout rate) then widespread rolling blackouts will be completely unavoidable. If Russia can completely disable the remaining 750kV infrastructure then Ukraine really doesn't have much manoeuvring room left, the reason being a point I'll touch upon later in regards to TPP.\n\nI saw a comment earlier referencing Ukraine's preparations to harden and defend its substations, the numbers were... *not great*.\n\nUkraine is going to have 22 of the remaining 81 high voltage substations defended \"actively\", presumably this means being under the AD umbrella. The remaining 73% of Ukraine's energy transmission backbone is relying upon sandbags, revetments and in some cases concrete encasement to try and limit the damage. The limited coverage of Air Defence, an ongoing problem since the war began, is going to significantly exacerbate Ukraine's ability to maintain their transmission grid.\n\n---------\n**The destruction of Ukraine's Thermal Power Plants (TPP).**\n---------\n\nNot often mentioned has been the widespread disruption, damage and outright operational destruction of Ukraine's Thermal Power Plants, mostly Gas and Coal plants. The majority of the media tends to focus on the loss of transformers and substations as these were overwhelmingly responsible for Ukraine's blackouts last winter, however this oversimplifies Ukraine's challenges and arguably (In my opinion at least) Ukraine's constrained ability to produce sufficient power from these sources is going to be more important this winter.\n\nPre-War Ukraine had a generation capacity of approximately 31.7GW via TPP with a typical day to day production capacity of 16GW. As of April 2023 this has been **reduced to just 5GW of typical day to day load capacity.**\n\nUkraine relies more than ever upon it's remaining Nuclear Power Plants and the Hydro power (which is relatively meagre compared to Ukraine's baseload production requirements and incapable of bridging the gap, despite literally bridging gaps (again I'll show myself out)).\n\nIt actually became such an issue during the Russian winter campaign that Ukraine had to suspend it's electrical exports to Europe, which notably generated some $524M of much needed revenues. Currently they now only export 200MW per day for 12hr a day, so hardly a significant number.\n\nThe reason this is important is because Russia largely cannot touch Ukraine's Nuclear Power Plants without risking widespread admonishment and aside from ZNPP which is actively occupied, the other plants have been relatively unscathed. This is to Ukraine's benefit, having a large baseline production capacity which is \"naturally protected\" is a bonus to be sure. However this has resulted in a heavy Russian focus on damaging and rendering Ukraine's TPP's unserviceable, which seems to have been relatively effective.\n\n**By April of 2023 Ukraine had lost 71.5% of its baseline pre-war capacity in TPP generation.** This highlights serious pressure on Ukraine's electrical grid even before the upcoming winter phase. Being overly reliant on Nuclear Power Plants makes Ukraine extremely vulnerable given the relatively limited junctions and substations connecting these plants to the wider network, overwhelmingly via the same extremely difficult to repair/replace 750kV transmission grid.\n\nSince then Ukraine has managed to repair and bring back online approximately 1.5GW of that lost TPP production capacity, which has only been a repair of 15%~ of the currently offline capacity. **A large portion, around 10GW or so of Ukraine's Thermal Power Generation (Gas/Coal/Oil) still remains out of action.**\n\nWorse still a large number of Ukraine's TPP's are in relatively close proximity to the front line and at risk of being struck. There's not much Ukraine can do here, if the lines move even marginally in Russia's favour more of their regional electrical infrastructure and power generation capacity falls under the threat of long range fires.\n\nThis highlights just how vulnerable Ukraine's power generation is. Russia has a distinct advantage moving forwards as a vast majority of the capacity they knocked out last winter still remains offline, leaving them with a smaller number of vulnerable targets and Ukraine with a much smaller amount of breathing room.",

New 750kV transformers have a production lead time of more than a year per unit and represent the single largest constraint for Ukraine in terms of being able to maintain it&#39;s transmission grid.</p>\n\n<p>During the winter campaign things considerably worsened as Russia focused most of its efforts toward knocking out these high voltage substations. <strong>41/94 (43%) were damaged, sometimes heavily, or outright destroyed by April of 2023.</strong> More than half of these substations have been hit more than once further exacerbating the damage.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ukrenergo claims that 67% of the damaged substations have been repaired or partially repaired</strong>, if this claim is accurate then 28 of the damaged 41 substations are operational again, <strong>leaving 13 substations still completely out of action</strong>. Ukraine is going into the winter with 81 high voltage transmission substations with a further 28 substations (35%) in some state of potential disrepair/limited capacity due to prior damage.</p>\n\n<p>If Russia turns up the heat and see&#39;s the same level of success it saw last year (notably a 43% knockout rate) then widespread rolling blackouts will be completely unavoidable. If Russia can completely disable the remaining 750kV infrastructure then Ukraine really doesn&#39;t have much manoeuvring room left, the reason being a point I&#39;ll touch upon later in regards to TPP.</p>\n\n<p>I saw a comment earlier referencing Ukraine&#39;s preparations to harden and defend its substations, the numbers were... <em>not great</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine is going to have 22 of the remaining 81 high voltage substations defended &quot;actively&quot;, presumably this means being under the AD umbrella. The remaining 73% of Ukraine&#39;s energy transmission backbone is relying upon sandbags, revetments and in some cases concrete encasement to try and limit the damage. The limited coverage of Air Defence, an ongoing problem since the war began, is going to significantly exacerbate Ukraine&#39;s ability to maintain their transmission grid.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h2><strong>The destruction of Ukraine&#39;s Thermal Power Plants (TPP).</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Not often mentioned has been the widespread disruption, damage and outright operational destruction of Ukraine&#39;s Thermal Power Plants, mostly Gas and Coal plants. The majority of the media tends to focus on the loss of transformers and substations as these were overwhelmingly responsible for Ukraine&#39;s blackouts last winter, however this oversimplifies Ukraine&#39;s challenges and arguably (In my opinion at least) Ukraine&#39;s constrained ability to produce sufficient power from these sources is going to be more important this winter.</p>\n\n<p>Pre-War Ukraine had a generation capacity of approximately 31.7GW via TPP with a typical day to day production capacity of 16GW. As of April 2023 this has been <strong>reduced to just 5GW of typical day to day load capacity.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Ukraine relies more than ever upon it&#39;s remaining Nuclear Power Plants and the Hydro power (which is relatively meagre compared to Ukraine&#39;s baseload production requirements and incapable of bridging the gap, despite literally bridging gaps (again I&#39;ll show myself out)).</p>\n\n<p>It actually became such an issue during the Russian winter campaign that Ukraine had to suspend it&#39;s electrical exports to Europe, which notably generated some $524M of much needed revenues. Currently they now only export 200MW per day for 12hr a day, so hardly a significant number.</p>\n\n<p>The reason this is important is because Russia largely cannot touch Ukraine&#39;s Nuclear Power Plants without risking widespread admonishment and aside from ZNPP which is actively occupied, the other plants have been relatively unscathed. This is to Ukraine&#39;s benefit, having a large baseline production capacity which is &quot;naturally protected&quot; is a bonus to be sure. However this has resulted in a heavy Russian focus on damaging and rendering Ukraine&#39;s TPP&#39;s unserviceable, which seems to have been relatively effective.</p>\n\n<p><strong>By April of 2023 Ukraine had lost 71.5% of its baseline pre-war capacity in TPP generation.</strong> This highlights serious pressure on Ukraine&#39;s electrical grid even before the upcoming winter phase. Being overly reliant on Nuclear Power Plants makes Ukraine extremely vulnerable given the relatively limited junctions and substations connecting these plants to the wider network, overwhelmingly via the same extremely difficult to repair/replace 750kV transmission grid.</p>\n\n<p>Since then Ukraine has managed to repair and bring back online approximately 1.5GW of that lost TPP production capacity, which has only been a repair of 15%~ of the currently offline capacity. <strong>A large portion, around 10GW or so of Ukraine&#39;s Thermal Power Generation (Gas/Coal/Oil) still remains out of action.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Worse still a large number of Ukraine&#39;s TPP&#39;s are in relatively close proximity to the front line and at risk of being struck. There&#39;s not much Ukraine can do here, if the lines move even marginally in Russia&#39;s favour more of their regional electrical infrastructure and power generation capacity falls under the threat of long range fires.</p>\n\n<p>This highlights just how vulnerable Ukraine&#39;s power generation is. Russia has a distinct advantage moving forwards as a vast majority of the capacity they knocked out last winter still remains offline, leaving them with a smaller number of vulnerable targets and Ukraine with a much smaller amount of breathing room.</p>\n</div>",

Now, you add those two figures up, and you get close to 1mm in runrate *production* in Europe, if they can follow through. Obviously, we don't know what's going to get shipped to Ukraine, and what replacement levels are going to be like.

However, Russia's newest offensive is the most narrow one yet, mostly focused on the area around Avdiivka.  Previous offensives are a lot more broad.  It would be an excellent time for Ukraine to avoid strenuous activity in other parts of the front.  Instead, Ukraine's attacking:\n\nAcross the Dnipro\n\nIn Robotyne still\n\nIn Horlivka for some reason\n\nUntil recently south of Bakhmut\n\nSome of those attacks have decent justifications behind them, but all of them are draining manpower at higher rates than if those troops weren't engaged in them.  And Russia isn't forcing Ukraine to do those attacks either.  In other words, at times Ukraine can absolutely do more to lower the intensity of the war, and this is for now one of those times.\n\nThe second simple solution isn't going to solve the manpower issue, but it might make some things easier, and that's consolidating brigades.  Ukraine's army has ballooned in size thus far this war, and even recently they enacted 2 new active brigades.  Of course, basically every brigade in Ukraine right now is understrength, and many brigades have very subpar command officers due to a shortage.\n\nBy consolidating brigades, this won't solve the need for manpower but it'll create more reserves in the short term and increase the overall quality of existing brigades.\n\nThose are the two \"simpler\" solutions.  More complicated solutions involve reforming Ukraine's mobilization system to be more aggressive, or reducing exemptions from mobilization, which are currently broad.  There are still plenty of theoretical manpower sources in the country, however most of them are either actively dodging the draft or exempt for various reasons.\n\nKyiv's been hesitant to fix this because (despite certain perceptions) the current govt is heavily motivated by doing popular things and not doing unpopular things.  Zelensky did begin the progress of retrofitting the entire mobilization system, but some sources have suggested that in the short term that made the issue harder.  By firing every regional chief, not only has short-term inflow been disrupted, but they're having trouble finding worthy replacements because people are hesitant to take what they view as an increasingly controversial job.",

                    "body": "The age-old problem and answer to destroying any insurgency is the question of legitimacy.\n\nLet's create a kinda silly scenario that simplifies the point: let's say the Queen of Barbieland was overthrown in a coup suspiciously coordinated by a certain Russian educational group named after a German musician to put a pro-Russian anti-monarchist in power, who will proceed to sell the entire economy to Russia. You're a farmer who was enjoying a solid paycheck on previous economic conditions, and had no significant qualms with the Queen, do you see this installed government as legitimate?\n\nInsurgencies exist where a government lacks legitimacy in an area. Illegitimacy may arise based on factors such as ethnicism, economics, political ideology, etc. For whatever reason, the rebelling region does not want to be part of the connected metropole.\n\nHow to establish legitimacy is the million dollar question that has many answers. Sometimes the situation is FBAR that the metropole concedes to the insurgency, and perhaps bets its laurels on better future relations. An example of this would be the Irish War of Independence that lasted until 1920, with Ireland granted independence and rule over most of the island, and only left the Commonwealth in 1949. Quashing an insurgency may include concessions to the defeated side; while Chechen rebel groups were thoroughly routed by the RAF in 2001, Moscow gifted Chechnya a degree of self-governance that gave the installed Kadyrov regime legitimacy that has lasted. Other times, the insurgency just gets kinda forgotten about because circumstances in the region change positively enough that people are happy with the metropole; an example is Chiapas, Mexico: after a COIN-OP that included stealth undermining the FZLN, the Zapatista movement lost influence as economic conditions slowly improved. The FZLN is practically non-functional; not surprising, the southern Mexican states are leading in economic growth. Other times, a COIN-OP is straight up brutal and focused on forced integration; the most famous is the current Uyghur conflict in China.\n\nA complicating factor with Hamas is that their legitimacy derives from its willingness to attack Israel at all costs. Fatah lost its legitimacy because it's seen as corrupt and appeasing. On the economic/social front, Hamas may be a lot less popular, so it's possible that their willingness to keep attacking is the reason why they're still in power, living standards be damned.\n\nWhich ties into another complicating factor: existence. For many Palestineans, Palestinean independence is mutually inclusive of the destruction of Israel. There can be no Israeli state at all, and this view is shared by organizations/countries like Hezbollah and Iran. As a contrasting example, the Irish independence movement didn't seek the destruction of the United Kingdom.\n\nThe most practical solution here would be to give the Palestineans more autonomy and control of their affairs. However, from an Israeli POV, they've already tried this, most notably with the infamous 2000 Camp David Summit plan which is especially generous by today's standards, only to be attacked multiple times. From a Palestinean POV, the Israeli state cannot be trusted especially now, so the only rational path includes some violent resistance. Existing organizations like Fatah are seen as illegitimate, and there's no popular moderate figure in Palestine who might break the deadlock and revive negotiations. For Palestineans, Israel has screwed them over so many times that conceding anything will anger the population.\n\nEven trying to frame this banally can be tricky - for Israelis and their sympathizers, the Arab Palestineans bear most of the blame, for they instigated rounds of conflicts many times and refused to de-escalate. The Arab Palestineans and their sympathizers, they see Israel as yet another exploitative colonial-settler state, hence all escalations in the conflict are the fault of Israel, with Palestinean violent responses being justified as they were \"on the land first\".\n\nSo that's Israel's big issue here in conducting COIN-OPs. The Israeli population does not see the Palestinean cause as having the moral high-ground, lacks legitimacy, and a future Palestinean state will only escalate. The Arab Palestinean population will not see Israel as a legitimate nation any time soon, much less a legitimate government. The Arab nations that the Palestineans could once rely on for support now have leaders who largely see the movement as rudderless. Hence, there's no obvious path to de-escalation in the foreseeable future.",

For Palestineans, Israel has screwed them over so many times that conceding anything will anger the population.</p>\n\n<p>Even trying to frame this banally can be tricky - for Israelis and their sympathizers, the Arab Palestineans bear most of the blame, for they instigated rounds of conflicts many times and refused to de-escalate. The Arab Palestineans and their sympathizers, they see Israel as yet another exploitative colonial-settler state, hence all escalations in the conflict are the fault of Israel, with Palestinean violent responses being justified as they were &quot;on the land first&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>So that&#39;s Israel&#39;s big issue here in conducting COIN-OPs. The Israeli population does not see the Palestinean cause as having the moral high-ground, lacks legitimacy, and a future Palestinean state will only escalate. The Arab Palestinean population will not see Israel as a legitimate nation any time soon, much less a legitimate government. The Arab nations that the Palestineans could once rely on for support now have leaders who largely see the movement as rudderless. Hence, there&#39;s no obvious path to de-escalation in the foreseeable future.</p>\n</div>",

The level of support for the actions of the Russian armed forces has increased slightly. The highest level of support is demonstrated by older respondents who trust television and those who approve of the president\u2019s activities. More than half of those surveyed believe that the SMO is progressing successfully. At the same time, over the past month the number of supporters of peace negotiations has increased slightly (up to 55%). Respondents cite the main reason for starting the SMO to protect the residents of Donbass. The majority are confident that hostilities will continue for at least another six months (almost half say more than a year). If respondents had the opportunity to go back in time and influence the decision to start a SMO, then 41% would cancel such a decision, and 43% would support it. The majority are ready to support V. Putin if he announces the end of hostilities, but on the condition that new territories are preserved.*\r  \n\r  \nIn October 2023, the level of attention to Ukrainian events has not changed over the past three months. Thus, 20% of respondents say that they follow \u201cvery closely\u201d (in September - 18%), another 29% follow \u201cquite carefully\u201d (in September - 30%). 35% of respondents follow without much attention, and 15% do not follow at all. People aged 55 and older follow events in Ukraine most closely (28% very closely, 33% quite closely).\n\nThe level of support for the actions of the Russian armed forces in Ukraine remains high and has not undergone significant changes since the beginning of the conflict: in October, 76% responded that they definitely support and rather support (73% in September). They do not support \u2013 a total of 16% (in August \u2013 20%).\n\nThe level of support for the actions of the Russian Armed Forces is higher among older respondents (55 years and older) - 82%, of which 55% definitely support; among those who trust television as a source of information (88% support); approves of the activities of the Russian President (85%). At the same time, the level of support is lower among young people (18-24 years old) \u2013 62% (28% definitely support); among those who trust information from YouTube channels (63%); and does not approve of the president\u2019s activities (35%)\n\nIn October 2023, 62% believe that the SMO is progressing successfully (12% - very successfully, 50% somewhat successfully), over the past 5 months their number has increased slightly. The opposite point of view is shared by 21%.\n\nThe assessment of the success of the SMO varies markedly depending on the sources of information that respondents trust. Thus, among those who trust television, 15% believe that SMO is progressing very successfully and 59% - rather successfully, among users of Telegram channels the figures are 8% and 56%, respectively, among viewers of YouTube channels - 9% and 40%, respectively .\n\nOver the past 4 months, the opinion on the need to continue military operations or begin peace negotiations has remained virtually unchanged - 55% believe that peace negotiations should begin (in September - 51%), 38% are in favor of continuing military actions (in September - 39%).\n\nThe idea that peace negotiations need to begin is most often demonstrated by representatives of the youngest age group (18-24 years old) - 69%. Those surveyed aged 55 years and older are the only age group where opinions on the continuation of hostilities and the transition to peace negotiations are almost equal - 45% and 46%, respectively.\r  \n\r  \nThe majority of women believe that it is necessary to move on to peace negotiations (62%), while among men there is no dominant opinion: 48% are in favor of continuing hostilities, 47% are in favor of moving to peace negotiations. \r  \n\r  \nMore often than others, those who trust information from television (46%) and telegram channels (41%) are in favor of continuing hostilities; those who trust information from social networks (65%) and YouTube most often speak about the need to move to peace negotiations -channels (69%).\r  \n\r  \nMoscow stands out from other populated areas. Muscovites are less ready to move on to peace negotiations - only 38% share this opinion, while in other settlements about half of those surveyed believe that it is necessary to start peace negotiations.\r  \n\r  \nAmong those who approve of V. Putin's activities as president, there are slightly more supporters of peace negotiations than supporters of continuing military operations - 51% and 42%, respectively. The majority (72%) who disapprove of the president\u2019s activities believe that it is necessary to move on to peace negotiations.\n\nAccording to data from an open-ended question (no prompts were offered, answers were recorded from the respondents\u2019 words and then coded), a quarter of Russians (25%) believe that Russia launched a special operation to: \u201cprotect/free the residents of Donbass/Russian people,\u201d according to 14% of respondents \u2014 to \u201ceradicate fascism, exterminate Nazism.\u201d Another 13% of respondents talk about protecting Ukraine and Western countries from aggression. This question was previously asked in February 2023 . \n\nThe Russians are confident that hostilities will continue for a long time. Thus, almost half of the respondents (46%) answered that the SMO will last more than a year, from six months to a year - 23% of respondents. 22% found it difficult to answer.\n\nIf respondents had the opportunity to go back in time and cancel or support the start of a military operation in Ukraine, 43% would support it (21% would definitely support it), and 41% would cancel it (23% would definitely cancel it).\n\nYounger respondents\u2014under 24 years of age (56%)\u2014would be more likely to be willing to abolish SMO. The decision to start would be supported primarily by representatives of the oldest age group (55 years and older) - 51%. Also, among Muscovites there is a slightly higher proportion of those who would support a special operation if they had the opportunity to return to the past (55%) than among residents of other settlements. Among those who support the actions of the Russian Armed Forces in Ukraine, 24% responded that they would cancel the start of the SMO, while among those who do not support the actions of the armed forces, 12% noted that they would support the start of the SMO.\n\nAs part of this survey, an experiment was carried out. Using a random number generator, respondents were divided into two equal groups, each of which was asked a question in one of two formulations. The experiment showed that the majority of respondents (70%) would support V. Putin\u2019s decision if the president decided to end the military conflict with Ukraine. However, if V. Putin decided to end the conflict subject to the return of the annexed territories, only a third (34%) of Russians would support his actions.",

The UN declared these settlements illegal 20 years ago and it's only accelerated since then. They've been undermining Palestinian liberation organizations, many of which are/were far less extreme than Hamas, for decades longer.\n\nCalling it \"Palestinian land\" obscures the incredibly difficult and ultimately unsolvable argument about whose land it is. Some of the places Israel has \"settled\" were occupied by Jews for hundreds or thousands of years before the Jews previously living there were violently kicked out. Look up the Jewish community in Hebron, for instance. \n\nAlso, the UN has shown itself to be an incredibly biased and unreliable organization when it comes to dealing with Israel. I can't take anything they say about the conflict seriously anymore because their bias has been shown again and again. \n\nAt the same time, I want to make clear that I don't support the settlements at all, and if it were up to me, all the settlers would be kicked out tomorrow. I say that as someone who has direct family members living in settlements. But from the perspective of the Israeli government, it's a very difficult issue. People move to the occupied territory no matter what the official Israeli position is on the subject, and the government doesn't have the capacity to deal with 500,000 homeless people. Still, that's not a good enough excuse, and they should do more.\n\n>Dude, have you listened to the things members of Likud say? They consider Palestinians to be animals and talk openly about their intent to cleanse them from the land. Their Minister of National Security openly venerates a mass-murderer. These attitudes absolutely shape the actions of the Israeli government, it's na\u00efve to assume otherwise.\n\nI am aware of how fucked up Likud is. At the same time, I can't exactly blame people for getting very emotional after the events of October 7th. Fortunately, the IDF is a much more liberal institution than Likud, and has shown itself to have a lot of independence from the government. The horrible stuff some Likud people say is not widely endorsed by Israeli society. Itamar Ben-Gvir is not part of the War Cabinet and has been thoroughly sidelined since October 7th. But the man is a criminal and if he was executed tomorrow I would feel no remorse. Same goes for Netanyahu as far as I'm concerned. \n\nMeanwhile, Hamas is supported by 75% of Palestinians.

                                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>The Israeli government has been facilitating the seizure of Palestinian land for decades now. The UN declared these settlements illegal 20 years ago and it&#39;s only accelerated since then. They&#39;ve been undermining Palestinian liberation organizations, many of which are/were far less extreme than Hamas, for decades longer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Calling it &quot;Palestinian land&quot; obscures the incredibly difficult and ultimately unsolvable argument about whose land it is. Some of the places Israel has &quot;settled&quot; were occupied by Jews for hundreds or thousands of years before the Jews previously living there were violently kicked out. Look up the Jewish community in Hebron, for instance. </p>\n\n<p>Also, the UN has shown itself to be an incredibly biased and unreliable organization when it comes to dealing with Israel. I can&#39;t take anything they say about the conflict seriously anymore because their bias has been shown again and again. </p>\n\n<p>At the same time, I want to make clear that I don&#39;t support the settlements at all, and if it were up to me, all the settlers would be kicked out tomorrow. I say that as someone who has direct family members living in settlements. But from the perspective of the Israeli government, it&#39;s a very difficult issue. People move to the occupied territory no matter what the official Israeli position is on the subject, and the government doesn&#39;t have the capacity to deal with 500,000 homeless people. Still, that&#39;s not a good enough excuse, and they should do more.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dude, have you listened to the things members of Likud say? They consider Palestinians to be animals and talk openly about their intent to cleanse them from the land. Their Minister of National Security openly venerates a mass-murderer. These attitudes absolutely shape the actions of the Israeli government, it&#39;s na\u00efve to assume otherwise.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I am aware of how fucked up Likud is. At the same time, I can&#39;t exactly blame people for getting very emotional after the events of October 7th. Fortunately, the IDF is a much more liberal institution than Likud, and has shown itself to have a lot of independence from the government. The horrible stuff some Likud people say is not widely endorsed by Israeli society. Itamar Ben-Gvir is not part of the War Cabinet and has been thoroughly sidelined since October 7th. But the man is a criminal and if he was executed tomorrow I would feel no remorse. Same goes for Netanyahu as far as I&#39;m concerned. </p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Hamas is supported by 75% of Palestinians. They have created an entire government based on violence and death. They consider Israelis to be animals and talk openly about cleansing them from the land. People in Gaza are some of the most thoroughly indoctrinated haters of Jews in the whole world. Key Palestinian leaders worked with Hitler during WW2 and imported lots of antisemitic ideas that they still propagate to this day.
