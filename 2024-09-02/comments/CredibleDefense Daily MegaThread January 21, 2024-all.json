Somalia had threatened war because it saw the deal as an Ethiopian grab of Somali territory. Egypt now offers \"support in case of aggression against one of the Arab countries\" and says it [\"will not allow anyone to threaten Somalia or affect its security\"](https://www.voanews.com/a/president-sisi-says-egypt-will-not-allow-any-threat-to-somalia-or-its-security-/7448892.html).\n\nI can understand that Ethiopia, landlocked since Eritrea became independent in 1993, wants a port (it currently uses Djibouti). Following the Tigray War, they obviously don't want the port to be in the north, where logistics would have to run through or close by Tigray, despite the dramatic improvement of relations with Eritrea in recent years. I don't understand why they would want a naval base, though. Landlocked Ethiopia [does have a navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopian_Navy) based in Djibouti, but particularly given the rather poor showing of the Ethiopian army in the Tigray War and the various insurgencies that Ethiopia still suffers I don't see why they would prioritize it. \n\nEven more surprising to me is that Somalia's government is in any shape to credibly threaten war, particularly against Ethiopia, a regional powerhouse despite their army's recent problems. The Ethiopian army is almost ten times the size of the Somali Armed Forces (~160,000 for Ethiopia, ~15,000 for Somalia), Somalia has its own insurgency in the South, and the northern Somali provinces of Puntland and Somaliland maintain de facto independence of different degrees without Somalia being able to do anything about it. They probably enjoy the support of some of the Ethiopian insurgents, though, so they could try to cause trouble for Ethiopia in areas far away from Somaliland.\n\nEgypt, finally, has bad relations with Ethiopia due to an Ethiopian dam on the Blue Nile that threatens Egypt's water supply. Egypt has in the past demonstrated the capability to intervene in the region, for example in Yemen in the 1960s. They lack recent military experience beyond fighting their own insurgents in the Sinai, though. Still, militarily and economically they are far stronger than any other faction currently involved. What they stand to gain, other than the joy of opposing Ethiopia, is unclear to me; maybe they hope that threats will be sufficient deterrence to cause Ethiopia to back off, which would be a win for Egypt and might go well with the domestic audience.",

The tunnel network is a major issue; its both the crucial asset for Hamas, but destroying them also risks killing the hostages in the process. Sending troops into the network is also slow and dangerous, as it basically creates a level playing field between IDF and Hamas.

China has a current account surplus and capital account deficit, meaning they are net sellers of goods and net buyers of foreign assets. That means if China was transacting in Yuan instead of dollars they would be taking Yuan out of the global financial system. The only way for more Yuan to enter the system would be for China to loan back those funds. But China is naturally against doing that at a large scale, since doing so would cause the Yuan to appreciate, and a good part of their manufacturing competitiveness is based on currency advantage.\n\nMaybe an individual country that runs a bilateral surplus with China (of which there are a few) could store part of their reserves in Chinese assets since they'll have an excess of Yuan (completely setting aside the question if your any more likely to get those assets out of China once they're invested), but because of the structure of global capital flows, as long as China is obsessed with structuring their economy to be incredibly competitive in manufacturing and as a side effect generate a large trade surplus, they'll never be a major store of asset value for other countries.\n\nIf you ever wondered Russia didn't fully divest from the West prior to conflict, its for these exact reason. Global capital flows (mostly driven by China), make it very hard to hold your foreign assets in anything except Western assets.\n\nTo answer your original supposition \"where there's a will there's a way,\" it would be like if you had a mine that went 3,000 ft. straight down, and you partner with a company that owns the elevator that gets you down there. If suddenly you get into an argument with that company and they take away the key to the elevator, you could go around to all the other companies and say 'Can you get us down there,' and they might say 'no, our elevator only goes 100ft., it will take us at least 50 years to develop an elevator that goes that far down.'

There are very good reasons not to keep your assets in yuan, for example, ranging from the asset governance model in Beijing (individual assets are both a lot easier to freeze and the legislation that governs when they can be frozen is elastic enough that eating the wrong dish in October is reason enough to freeze them) to currency controls and the strict governance model of the People's Bank.\n\nHolding assets in USD or eventually USD-denominated property was a pretty big hurdle for oligarchs even pre-war, it was a lot harder than holding it in INR (and obviously a whole lot harder than just holding them in RUB, though ironically still easier than holding them in RMB under some circumstances). The USD not being a glorified drug cartel's token currency in the first place obviously played a huge role. But a big reason for putting up with all of it was that it protected *them* from the actions of hostile or greedy political leadership in Moscow.\n\nThe talk around freezing \"Russian assets\" is a lot more complicated than well, it belongs to citizens who hold Russian citizenship at a bad time but that's no reason to fault them, and confiscating them would just signal that the USD is a bad currency to hold assets in because of abusive state authorities.\n\nFor example, a surprising amount of those assets were transfered through means that effectively amount to money laundering, and not all of it was rendered untouchable by friendly legislation like golden visas or generous foreign direct investment checks and ballances. They are in fact *legally* freezable and the only reason they haven't been frozen was that it was politically useful to turn a blind eye to it.\n\nEdit: FWIW, while the linked article is a textbook case of why a purely historical perspective is often a poor foundation for analysis of contemporary events, it's not entirely without merit, and I'd encourage everyone to read it with a critical eye. Nicholas Mulder is a reputable authority on the history of economic warfare. Unfortunately, this article reflects the bias of his research (hence its obvious, including factual, shortcomings) and it was posted by a user who has a history of posting in bad faith (hence the downvotes) but I wouldn't discard it as just another ill-informed op-ed. It's a good example of why it's simultaneously so important to listen to what historians have to say and to take what they say with the grain of salt warranted by the perspective of someone who is only used to historical, rather than current, uncertainty.",
