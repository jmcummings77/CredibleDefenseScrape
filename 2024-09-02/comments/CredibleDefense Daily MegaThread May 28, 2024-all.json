As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

Formally, Alabuga Polytech is not a college. All students are enrolled in the Yelabuga Polytechnic College, and Polytech on paper - only additional courses. Accordingly, the diploma at graduation is also not from Alabuga. All general education subjects are taught by teachers from the EPK, and on a residual basis. Also, teachers from the EPC cannot boast of a high level of quality of education. As a result, the knowledge of students in different fields remains at the level of the ninth grade of the school.\n\n>Another illustrative story that speaks of the attitude towards potential \"Ilons Masks\". At the beginning of the school year, paintball is played in the economic zone. The event is so large-scale that a whole tug of paintball balls was ordered for it. When she arrived at Alabuga, it turned out that there was no equipment to unload it. Several students had to unload throughout the day, without rest and food.\n\n\u2026\n\n>One of the students claims that instead of the planned team building, simplifying the acquaintance of hundreds of people who have just entered the same college, paintball leads to hazing. Paintball is also designed to develop patriotism among students. According to the plot, the first month the students compete with each other, and then \"feat\" against the fascists, professional paintball players, allegedly reconstructing the battles of the Great War near Stalingrad. A curious detail - the fascist flag looks like the flag of Nazi Germany, but instead of a swastika in a white circle - the symbolism of the NATO bloc.\n\n\n\u2026\n\n>Another punishment that former student Nastya mentions is digging trenches: \"In the end, the results were summed up, and the teams that played the worst, they dug trenches. And it was still raining there, and they didn't let us go home. There, somewhere in the end, someone was already sorry.\" According to another source, about 400 people were digging trenches. Everyone was involved in this, except for those teams that took first and second places in the competition. Students called their parents and complained. Several parents wrote a complaint to the local prosecutor's office. They demanded to figure out what happened to the students during paintball, but \"Alabuga\" provided papers that everything was legal, and the students voluntarily took part in the game and in digging trenches.\n\n\u2026\n\n>In addition to the staged fight against terrorists on the battlefield, students reconstructed the battles of the Great Patriotic War. The best 1st year students are sergeants, the most talented senior students are captains, and generals are managerial staff. Among the latter was Timur Shagivaleev. During the game from Shagivaleev, you could hear that everything did not go according to plan. Sometimes he broke down at the students, yelled at them.\n\n>On one of the game days, after the defeat of Shagivaleev's team, in the evening, Shagivaleev decided to hold a training under his own command. Several girls complained of headache and high blood pressure - they asked to give them a rest, to which Shagivaleev replied: \"What kind of rest?! Who has a headache can go home right away, we don't need such students! It's fucking going on in the country! The country needs heroes!\"\n\n\u2026\n\n\n>Paintball is a revealing story, but not the worst in the context of describing the modern life of Alabuga students.

After all, the bulk of the production of combat UAVs is planned to be organized by their hands.\n\n>Now about 1,000 people are studying at the polytechnic. Several hundred of them are already involved in the assembly of the Shaheds, which are supplied from Iran. First of all, according to the source, we are talking about children from fifteen to seventeen years old who entered college after the ninth grade of school. Initially, the choice in favor of underage students was made because adults are usually final-year students of the college. They were already involved in other projects, were engaged in other important things and there was no point in attracting them. That's not the case anymore. All possible forces are now being transferred to the Shahed assembly project. Some productions are stopped, and some are completely liquidated.\n\n\n\u2026\n\n\n>The salary of the students involved in the production depends on the implementation of the plan. On average, this is an amount in the region of 30-40 thousand rubles. Students receive salaries officially - employment contracts have been concluded with them. But the work schedule approved by the contract does not correspond to reality. Students are not paid extra for processing: \"We also worked on the eighth and ninth of May. Nobody paid us anything extra. Overtime for work on weekends, no one paid anything either,\" says one of the students.\n\n>Students say that sometimes they have to work for several days without sleep and \"almost without food.\" When asked why the students themselves do not rebel against this attitude towards themselves, one of them answers: \"Everyone is afraid.

The reaction: angry calls from Berlin and Washington and the threat to stop supplying anti-aircraft missiles if such an incident were to happen again.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Wow.

Its going to take equipment and frankly there is going to have to be a huge crash program to bring virtually everything in storage up to purring in fields and probably some of the equipment from active line units. And its really not going to be cheap, we are going to have to borrow a lot of money over two years to build a 21st century army to clear Russia from the Donbas.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/15kiq19/comment/jv6yg11/\">CredibleDefense Daily MegaThread August 07, 2023 : </a></p>\n\n<p>Training. I have been saying it for a year. Storm assaults did virtually nothing last year for Russia with far more people and against far less artillery.</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine needs mass, that is hundreds of tanks. It needs to train to work at battalion level and above in a coordinated combined arms fashion.</p>\n\n<p>The two approaches are so diametrically opposed I dont think there really is a discussion to have Anyone thinks Ukraine can run 20 Battles of the Isonzo River type stuff to get nowhere.... knock your socks off.</p>\n</div>",

The country deployed its intelligence agencies to surveil, hack, pressure, smear and allegedly threaten senior ICC staff in an effort to derail the court\u2019s inquiries.\n\nArticle highlights:\n\n* Israel, like the US, Russia and China, is not a member of the ICC. After Palestine\u2019s acceptance as an ICC member in 2015, any alleged war crimes \u2013 committed by those of any nationality \u2013 in occupied Palestinian territories now fell under the ICC jurisdiction.\n\n* One former defence official familiar with Israel\u2019s counter-ICC effort said joining the court had been \u201cperceived as the crossing of a red line\u201d and \u201cperhaps the most aggressive\u201d diplomatic move taken by the Palestinian Authority, which governs the West Bank. \u201cTo be recognised as a state in the UN is nice,\u201d they added. \u201cBut the ICC is a mechanism with teeth.\u201d\n\n* Israeli intelligence captured the communications of numerous ICC officials, including Khan and his predecessor as prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, intercepting phone calls, messages, emails and documents.\n\n* Netanyahu has taken a close interest in the intelligence operations against the ICC, and was described by one intelligence source as being \u201cobsessed\u201d with intercepts about the case. Overseen by his national security advisers, the efforts involved the domestic spy agency, the Shin Bet, as well as the military\u2019s intelligence directorate, Aman, and cyber-intelligence division, Unit 8200. Intelligence gleaned from intercepts was, sources said, disseminated to government ministries of justice, foreign affairs and strategic affairs.\n\n* A covert operation against Bensouda, revealed on Tuesday by the Guardian, was run personally by Netanyahu\u2019s close ally Yossi Cohen, who was at the time the director of Israel\u2019s foreign intelligence agency, the Mossad. At one stage, the spy chief even enlisted the help of the then president of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Joseph Kabila.\n\n* On 16 January 2015, within weeks of Palestine joining, Bensouda opened a preliminary examination into what in the legalese of the court was called \u201cthe situation in Palestine\u201d. The following month, two men who had managed to obtain the prosecutor\u2019s private address turned up at her home in The Hague. Sources familiar with the incident said the men declined to identify themselves when they arrived, but said they wanted to hand-deliver a letter to Bensouda on behalf of an unknown German woman who wanted to thank her. The envelope contained hundreds of dollars in cash and a note with an Israeli phone number.\n\n* When she was prosecutor, Bensouda formally disclosed her encounters with Cohen to a small group within the ICC, with the intention of putting on record her belief that she had been \u201cpersonally threatened\u201d, sources familiar with the disclosures said.\n\n* Five sources familiar with Israel\u2019s intelligence activities said it routinely spied on the phone calls made by Bensouda and her staff with Palestinians. Blocked by Israel from accessing Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, the ICC was forced to conduct much of its research by telephone, which made it more susceptible to surveillance. Thanks to their comprehensive access to Palestinian telecoms infrastructure, the sources said, intelligence operatives could capture the calls without installing spyware on the ICC official\u2019s devices.\n\n* One Israeli intelligence official said they regarded Donald Trump\u2019s administration as more cooperative than that of his Democratic predecessor. The Israelis felt sufficiently comfortable to ask for information from US intelligence about Bensouda, a request the source said would have been \u201cimpossible\u201d during Barack Obama\u2019s tenure.",

We&#39;re fairly far out from a robot dog with an assault rifle being anywhere in competition to be nearly as useful as a human with an assault rifle, or any number of comparably-priced UAVs.</p>\n</div>",

The idea is that if the Russians are vulnerable to American first strike, then they have an extremely strong incentive not to cross the nuclear threshold, because they have much more to lose than the US does.\n\nUnlike Russia, the US has functional and highly capable anti-ballistic missile defense systems like PATRIOT, a redundant set of missile defense early warning radar systems that are based not only on the ground in US territory but also in the air and space domains, as well as ground stations hosted by allies like Canada. Rather than just a handful of OTH ground radar stations within the US borders. Perhaps most importantly, the US fields a powerful nuclear triad (i.e., ICMBs, long range bombers, and nuclear missile submarines) where each separate leg of the stool poses a wholly separate and independent, existential second strike threat to Russia.\n\nThe quality and capabilities of the platforms forming each leg of the triad also far exceed the Russians' correlated capabilities and platforms. The Russians are still flying Tu-160s, which are similar in design and vintage to the US's soon-to-be-retired B1, even as the US is moving on to its *third* generation of stealth bombers when Russia hasn't even produced a single top class stealth plane of any variety yet. From what I've heard, their boomers are also incredibly loud by modern standards and thus easy for US Virginia-class attack subs to keep tabs on. There are also plenty of reports that Russian ICBMs have generally been maintained in a poor state. They invest in building the showy new model of Satan or whatever its called but neglect maintaining the bulk of the legacy missiles which would otherwise provide the core of Russian nuclear deterrence. \"All bling, no basics,\" as Perun famously summarized the RuAF in March 2022.\n\nWe just haven't witnessed the same rot that doomed Russia's pre-2022 military in the early phases of the conventional war in the Russian nuclear forces, but that's only because they have thankfully not been required to participate in the war thus far and there have been no combat failures to provide proof of their status. I have no doubt that they suffer from all the same corruption and mismanagement that plagues the rest of the military, and maybe it's even worse because the officers in the nuclear forces can shield any illegal activities from oversight behind the secrecy around nuclear operations in general, and they can compromise a nuclear capability and without anyone knowing until the nukes start to fly, at which point the officer is probably going to die anyway so why would he care if he gets caught for corruption?",

Patton struggled with armor breakthroughs against prepared fortifications in the Lorraine campaign so this is nothing new. \n\nThat leaves attrition. 5 things stand out. 1) Manpower 2) Anti Air 3) Artillery Ammo 4) Long Range PGMs 5) Drones\n\n3 and 4 can probably be solved with time. ATACMS/PRISM production along with investments opening up in 2025 for artillery shells. Long range PGMs well the JASSM line is hot and original lower range missiles are reaching shelf life. \n\n1 is pretty scary and the only thing I can think about is a draft including women for non combat roles.\n\n5 the US is predictably doing pretty badly on the drone innovation front. Ukraine and European allies should be able to scale and advance tech to keep on par or ahead of the Russians.\n\n2 is my biggest fear and the greatest advantage for Russia. Anti air is the biggest problem imo by far. Batteries are low, missiles stockpiles are low, missiles are expensive and production is far too low. On top of all that, INDOPACOM is a higher priority for air defense than Ukraine/Europe is. I'm not sure how the F-16's will be perform in Ukraine. I'd argue they're one of the bigger wild cards.

I actually think they missed a significant opportunity there.\n\nKherson was a clear demonstration that things weren't sunshine and rainbows for Ukraine. At the time, there were clear signs the Ukrainians were having a rough time, suffering significant casualties and struggling to make progress. In hindsight, the battle showed that Ukraine would struggle against fortified positions, that Ukraine had no effective way of clearing minefields (especially under fire), and it was a huge missed opportunity. If Ukraine had the right tools at the time (imagine how much more effective Storm Shadow would've been at destroying the Antonovski bridge than GMLRS were) they could've killed/captured a large portion of Russia's best remaining forces (they had tens of thousands of VDV holding the Kherson bridgehead). Instead, the Russians were able to withdraw largely unmolested. \n\n>This assumes Russia's theory of victory involves achieving stunning battlefield victories, which, as far as I can tell, we both agree is unlikely to happen.\n\nNo it doesn't, it assumes that Russia plans to capture the entirety of the oblasts that they have already officially annexed into Russia. Which is their stated goal. They've made extremely slow progress towards this goal by grinding battles of attrition with no signs of this changing any time soon. \n\n>I don't think they are so foolish as to continue at this intensity if they couldn't sustain it for as long as needed.\n\nThe current level of intensity is absolutely unsustainable for Russia. But they have the initiative in the conflict, so they can always dial back the intensity if/when things start looking rough. They're continuing the strategy right now, pressing Ukraine on multiple fronts, because it's their best opportunity to do so before large quantities of ammunition begin flowing to Ukraine and the UAF at least partially addresses their dire manpower shortages. \n\n>I dislike the focus on equipment because it often doesn't reflect the true state of the war.\n\nAs I said before, equipment is Russia's primary pain point. Most other inputs for Russia are anywhere from good to excellent, but equipment is one area where they will likely struggle going forward. They've been able to maintain the current rate of attrition by activating vast quantities of materiel from storage, but those expenditures are *waaaay* beyond their ability to replace them through new production. Even as Russia shifts to increase new production as those storage yards are depleted, it will require a significant decrease in fighting intensity as they won't be able to produce anywhere near the thousands of AFVs they're currently losing every year. \n\n>Wasn't Ukraine supposed to deplete Russian artillery in 2023 to the point where they could continue their offensive?\n\nNo? I think you might be referring to their hunting of Russian artillery during the 2023 offensive, but that was to reduce the amount of artillery Russia had locally, not overall. In fact, on paper at least, Russia is running out of artillery slower than other systems like tanks, IFVs, APCs, etc. \n\n>Russia was expected to run out of numerous resources early on?\n\nNot sure what you're referring to exactly with this one. Maybe long-range PGMs? In which case they did in fact need to dramatically decrease expenditures to build up a stockpile while they ramped up production. But just because some loud voices proclaimed that Russia was \"doomed\" as they \"ran out\" of certain things doesn't mean that was the general consensus, let alone what actual experts were saying. \n\n>Artillery shells and manpower are the only factors proven to significantly impact the power balance.\n\nOver the course of 2024 and especially in 2025, Ukraine will greatly reduce the advantage in fires Russia has enjoyed since the war began. Manpower will remain Ukraine's biggest pain point though, much like equipment is for Russia. \n\n>Ukraine should focus on fixing its problems, get off its high horse, and finally admit its faults instead of shifting the blame.\n\nCouldn't agree more. There are many *glaring* issues they still haven't properly addressed that they absolutely need to. It does seem like Syrsky is taking steps in the right direction at least, though not fast enough or significant enough imo. \n\n>Since the counteroffensive, they have tried everything, including trying to spin successes in the Black Sea campaign as major victories (and it failed to resonate).\n\nI mean, thats just because Ukraine needs successes to celebrate at a time when the war is very much not going well for them. That being said, their successes in the Black Sea are cause for celebration and have had a major impact on the war, namely by helping to keep Ukraine's economy from collapsing.\n\nSpeaking personally, Winter 2023-2024 was the point I became most pessimistic about Ukrainian chances in the whole war (save for the first few days). The more information that came out about their disastrous decisions during the 2023 offensive, including continuing assaults *for months* after it was clear there was no point and they were low on manpower, their decision to expend most of their remaining ammunition on that failed offensive despite minimal effects and an uncertain timeline for replenishment of ammunition, etc. the more I became concerned about Ukraine's theory of victory. I still have major doubts and concerns, but things appear much less dire today than they did 4 months ago imo.",

                    "body": "I agree that Ukraine was disorganized, suffered losses, and lacked western equipment, however I think a lot of that also applied to Russia (not specifically Western equipment, but you get what I mean)\n\n>Ukraine lost a lot of experienced troops and equipment fighting a brutal months long battle of attrition in Kherson.\n\nLikewise Russia had lost a significant amount of its experienced troops as well, especially a lot of its more specialized professional units like a large portion of the VDV and nearly the entirety of the 155th Separate Guards Naval Infantry Brigade. Due to the poor planning of the initial invasion, a Russia suffered significant casualties in the first months. If I had to guess, based on Russia forming long convoys on major roads including the infamous 60km long convoy stuck outside Kyiv for many days, that Russia wasn't planning on a conventional war but something more similar to how they handled Crimea. They expected they could seize major population centers, roads, military bases, etc and basically overrun Ukraine before they could mount a resistance. That obviously was not the case, and Russia suffered an enormous amount of casualties because they planned for an entirely different scenario and many of their troops were reportedly entirely unaware they were invading Ukraine in the first place. Ukraine obviously lost a lot of its experienced troops in the first year as well, most notably a very large portion of the Azov unit was stuck inside Mariupol, but Russia didn't come off much better either. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n>Also by that point in time very little in the way of western equipment had arrived, they had only a handful of western artillery systems\n\nI don't think it would have made a massive difference if it had either. I think the real game changers in western equipment are systems like the Patriot air defense & HIMARs rocket systems. They provide extraordinary capabilities compared to what Ukraine otherwise had, or entirely lacked. However these alone aren't enough to allow for a breakthrough. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nOther Western equipment even if it arrived earlier probably wouldn't have made as big of a difference as I believe is often portrayed. The Abrams, Leopards, Challengers, these are good tanks, and they're certainly better than even the more modern Russian counterparts, but they're not super machines. They're still similarly as vulnerable to being immobilized by landmines or drones like Soviet or Russian tanks. They're still vulnerable to artillery. They're still vulnerable to some AGTMs. You can likewise apply this to most other forms of Western equipment, they're superior, but they aren't game changers. This isn't a case of fighting the Zulus with rifles. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd also, they're not in as massive of numbers to make a massive difference either. I haven't kept up with the absolute specifics, but if I remember right the total amount of modern Western tanks stated to be delivered to Ukraine (regardless of if they've arrived or not) is something like 250-300. Its a decently large amount, but considering the scale of the war its just not enough. In the Gulf War there were 1,730 M2 Bradleys deployed on the front with 370 in reserve. 2,024 deployed Abrams with another 1,089 in reserve. During Operation Iraqi Freedom combining the V Corps & both Marine Tank Battalions gives 350 Abrams tanks, though it probably could be higher since I can't find any exact figures on how many total were deployed. Obviously, America's two wars with Iraq are different than Ukraine's current war, I know that well, but this illustrates the amount of equipment needed to wage large conventional wars like this. And even so, America's 350 tanks in 2003 is a pretty light deployment, but that was aided by the ability of America to effectively replenish any losses near instantly if needed and the matter that the conventional invasion was predicted to, and did end rather quickly. Again, its the tempo. I just don't see that waiting for the Western equipment to arrive is worth the cost of Russia digging in and preparing itself. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n>Ukraine didn\u2019t choose to not capitalize on that moment of Russian weakness, they simply couldn\u2019t.\n\nI'd be willing to admit that Ukraine's chance of success if they gambled to push Russia even further in Zaporizhzhia and the Donbas soon after the Kherson/Kharkiv operations is far from certain. It is likewise possible that they could have failed as they did in reality, or compromised themselves to a Russian counteroffensive instead. However its an opportunity that I think is lost by this point. The Zaporizhzhia offensive Ukraine undertook had 7 months of preparation in addition to Western equipment starting to arrive in numbers, and after 6 months of the offensive it amounted to basically nothing. Ukraine had resources at hand, especially given that although they exhausted lives and equipment on the Kherson front, the Kherson front is gone now since crossing the Dnipro for either side is again, a non-starter, which must free up some amount of resources for Ukraine. \n\n&nbsp; \n\nRight now we can't know for certain, but from what I've known I do think it was certainly an option that Ukraine had that they could have taken, but chose not to. Maybe those reasons will become more obvious to me with time. As an example, many people criticize the halting of German forces outside of Dunkirk as a major failure. But in the moment, and even in hindsight it was probably the right call. German units were running on fumes, were extremely outnumbered, armored units were at 50% or higher attrition rate with vehicles and tanks, they were starting to lack air cover, there was mass confusion as to where certain units even were, and the terrain of Flanders & around Calais was marshy and with many canals that would pose an issue to armored maneuver. Maybe this will come out as a similar decision that Ukraine correctly chose, but from what I see Ukraine definitely still had potential to press its advantage at the time.",
                    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I agree that Ukraine was disorganized, suffered losses, and lacked western equipment, however I think a lot of that also applied to Russia (not specifically Western equipment, but you get what I mean)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ukraine lost a lot of experienced troops and equipment fighting a brutal months long battle of attrition in Kherson.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Likewise Russia had lost a significant amount of its experienced troops as well, especially a lot of its more specialized professional units like a large portion of the VDV and nearly the entirety of the 155th Separate Guards Naval Infantry Brigade. Due to the poor planning of the initial invasion, a Russia suffered significant casualties in the first months. If I had to guess, based on Russia forming long convoys on major roads including the infamous 60km long convoy stuck outside Kyiv for many days, that Russia wasn&#39;t planning on a conventional war but something more similar to how they handled Crimea. They expected they could seize major population centers, roads, military bases, etc and basically overrun Ukraine before they could mount a resistance. That obviously was not the case, and Russia suffered an enormous amount of casualties because they planned for an entirely different scenario and many of their troops were reportedly entirely unaware they were invading Ukraine in the first place. Ukraine obviously lost a lot of its experienced troops in the first year as well, most notably a very large portion of the Azov unit was stuck inside Mariupol, but Russia didn&#39;t come off much better either. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Also by that point in time very little in the way of western equipment had arrived, they had only a handful of western artillery systems</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t think it would have made a massive difference if it had either. I think the real game changers in western equipment are systems like the Patriot air defense &amp; HIMARs rocket systems. They provide extraordinary capabilities compared to what Ukraine otherwise had, or entirely lacked. However these alone aren&#39;t enough to allow for a breakthrough. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Other Western equipment even if it arrived earlier probably wouldn&#39;t have made as big of a difference as I believe is often portrayed. The Abrams, Leopards, Challengers, these are good tanks, and they&#39;re certainly better than even the more modern Russian counterparts, but they&#39;re not super machines. They&#39;re still similarly as vulnerable to being immobilized by landmines or drones like Soviet or Russian tanks. They&#39;re still vulnerable to artillery. They&#39;re still vulnerable to some AGTMs. You can likewise apply this to most other forms of Western equipment, they&#39;re superior, but they aren&#39;t game changers. This isn&#39;t a case of fighting the Zulus with rifles. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>And also, they&#39;re not in as massive of numbers to make a massive difference either. I haven&#39;t kept up with the absolute specifics, but if I remember right the total amount of modern Western tanks stated to be delivered to Ukraine (regardless of if they&#39;ve arrived or not) is something like 250-300. Its a decently large amount, but considering the scale of the war its just not enough. In the Gulf War there were 1,730 M2 Bradleys deployed on the front with 370 in reserve. 2,024 deployed Abrams with another 1,089 in reserve. During Operation Iraqi Freedom combining the V Corps &amp; both Marine Tank Battalions gives 350 Abrams tanks, though it probably could be higher since I can&#39;t find any exact figures on how many total were deployed. Obviously, America&#39;s two wars with Iraq are different than Ukraine&#39;s current war, I know that well, but this illustrates the amount of equipment needed to wage large conventional wars like this. And even so, America&#39;s 350 tanks in 2003 is a pretty light deployment, but that was aided by the ability of America to effectively replenish any losses near instantly if needed and the matter that the conventional invasion was predicted to, and did end rather quickly. Again, its the tempo. I just don&#39;t see that waiting for the Western equipment to arrive is worth the cost of Russia digging in and preparing itself. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ukraine didn\u2019t choose to not capitalize on that moment of Russian weakness, they simply couldn\u2019t.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I&#39;d be willing to admit that Ukraine&#39;s chance of success if they gambled to push Russia even further in Zaporizhzhia and the Donbas soon after the Kherson/Kharkiv operations is far from certain. It is likewise possible that they could have failed as they did in reality, or compromised themselves to a Russian counteroffensive instead. However its an opportunity that I think is lost by this point. The Zaporizhzhia offensive Ukraine undertook had 7 months of preparation in addition to Western equipment starting to arrive in numbers, and after 6 months of the offensive it amounted to basically nothing. Ukraine had resources at hand, especially given that although they exhausted lives and equipment on the Kherson front, the Kherson front is gone now since crossing the Dnipro for either side is again, a non-starter, which must free up some amount of resources for Ukraine. </p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; </p>\n\n<p>Right now we can&#39;t know for certain, but from what I&#39;ve known I do think it was certainly an option that Ukraine had that they could have taken, but chose not to. Maybe those reasons will become more obvious to me with time. As an example, many people criticize the halting of German forces outside of Dunkirk as a major failure. But in the moment, and even in hindsight it was probably the right call. German units were running on fumes, were extremely outnumbered, armored units were at 50% or higher attrition rate with vehicles and tanks, they were starting to lack air cover, there was mass confusion as to where certain units even were, and the terrain of Flanders &amp; around Calais was marshy and with many canals that would pose an issue to armored maneuver. Maybe this will come out as a similar decision that Ukraine correctly chose, but from what I see Ukraine definitely still had potential to press its advantage at the time.</p>\n</div>",
