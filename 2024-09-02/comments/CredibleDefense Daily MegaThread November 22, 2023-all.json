        "body": "Ukrainian volunteer Yury Kasyanov complains that people producing drones for the war effort are recruited for the front. He says that this is part of the reason for lag of drones. \n\nHe would like that students or people in other sectors are mobilised to a higher degree. It gives the impression that enterprises working for ministry of defence are over mobilised compared to the rest and this inhibits production for the war effort. As it is describes it almost looks like self sabotage. The ministry needs people and goes looking in places it knows there are people since they are producing for them.\n\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/100001519908195/posts/pfbid02pnTtzbEBJERdQ8YMkGLsJC44H9SuKBJ8FRQPDHrBFFDzPVg5URWqd2aiSUiLtozWl/?app=fbl\n\n\u201c\u201d\u201d\nThere is a debate in society about students who are not accepted into the army. He said, they are our future, who will raise the country after the war, and in general, they are children...\n\nAnd at the same time, all non-students are taken into the army. Even those who are involved in defense projects, and on whom it depends whether drones will be on the front line today or tomorrow, and whether there will be a time \"after the war\" when students will be able to realize themselves.\n\nYesterday there were only a few such egregious cases - subpoenas came to the whole team, which makes hundreds of kamikaze drones a week. They don't have any bookings - where to get bookings if this is a volunteer project?...\n\nThey took into the army a conditional \"Uncle Vanya\", an old turner (don't take young students), to whom all the drone workers in the city were praying... Massive summonses are coming even to enterprises that issue bookings for workers engaged in the production of drones, and which really , right now, making weapons for the army,\n\nMany enterprises - I know - do not want to officially register employees even for defense orders. As soon as you register a person, the Military Commissariat will immediately pick him up. If he is not taken to the front, then he will be taken away from the work process for a couple of weeks to pass the VLK, sit under the offices, listen to the speeches of the Zampolit. Minus two weeks of working time - minus 200 FPV drones at the front.\n\nEnterprises engaged in defense projects can reserve no more than 50% of conscripts. Cultural enterprises, minsotsu, the mass media, not to mention the authorities, can arm everyone, and the defenders who make weapons - only half. Can you imagine?... And if you have a garage workshop for the manufacture of drones, and only four people, one of whom solders, another flies, the third glues, the fourth mills - someone must be sent to the front.\n\nIf you are a large enterprise, and you make many large drones under a contract with the Ministry of Defense, develop production, build hulls, dig underground, recruit people, make them armor (50%), then when the contract ends and the validity of the armor is also (six months) - your the workers will go to the trenches, and the next contract will be fulfilled by no one.\n\nSuch is the truth of life. There are not enough drones not only because there is no money for them, but because there is no one to work for them. And if there is someone to work for, then it is necessary to maintain a huge staff of lawyers in order to fend off the military commissars. Because the military committees have their own war.\n\nThe problem can be solved only by the Ministry of Defense Industry (we do not have it), which will take on its balance sheet all defense enterprises - both private and state, will be engaged in the search for workers for the defense sector, their training, distribution of defense orders, development of production, research and development works .\n\nThe logic of war will force the creation of such a ministry. But no one will work anymore.\n\nhttps://t.me/kasjanovcom\n\u201c\u201d\u201d",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Ukrainian volunteer Yury Kasyanov complains that people producing drones for the war effort are recruited for the front. He says that this is part of the reason for lag of drones. </p>\n\n<p>He would like that students or people in other sectors are mobilised to a higher degree. It gives the impression that enterprises working for ministry of defence are over mobilised compared to the rest and this inhibits production for the war effort. As it is describes it almost looks like self sabotage. The ministry needs people and goes looking in places it knows there are people since they are producing for them.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/100001519908195/posts/pfbid02pnTtzbEBJERdQ8YMkGLsJC44H9SuKBJ8FRQPDHrBFFDzPVg5URWqd2aiSUiLtozWl/?app=fbl\">https://www.facebook.com/100001519908195/posts/pfbid02pnTtzbEBJERdQ8YMkGLsJC44H9SuKBJ8FRQPDHrBFFDzPVg5URWqd2aiSUiLtozWl/?app=fbl</a></p>\n\n<p>\u201c\u201d\u201d\nThere is a debate in society about students who are not accepted into the army. He said, they are our future, who will raise the country after the war, and in general, they are children...</p>\n\n<p>And at the same time, all non-students are taken into the army. Even those who are involved in defense projects, and on whom it depends whether drones will be on the front line today or tomorrow, and whether there will be a time &quot;after the war&quot; when students will be able to realize themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Yesterday there were only a few such egregious cases - subpoenas came to the whole team, which makes hundreds of kamikaze drones a week. They don&#39;t have any bookings - where to get bookings if this is a volunteer project?...</p>\n\n<p>They took into the army a conditional &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot;, an old turner (don&#39;t take young students), to whom all the drone workers in the city were praying... Massive summonses are coming even to enterprises that issue bookings for workers engaged in the production of drones, and which really , right now, making weapons for the army,</p>\n\n<p>Many enterprises - I know - do not want to officially register employees even for defense orders. As soon as you register a person, the Military Commissariat will immediately pick him up. If he is not taken to the front, then he will be taken away from the work process for a couple of weeks to pass the VLK, sit under the offices, listen to the speeches of the Zampolit. Minus two weeks of working time - minus 200 FPV drones at the front.</p>\n\n<p>Enterprises engaged in defense projects can reserve no more than 50% of conscripts. Cultural enterprises, minsotsu, the mass media, not to mention the authorities, can arm everyone, and the defenders who make weapons - only half. Can you imagine?... And if you have a garage workshop for the manufacture of drones, and only four people, one of whom solders, another flies, the third glues, the fourth mills - someone must be sent to the front.</p>\n\n<p>If you are a large enterprise, and you make many large drones under a contract with the Ministry of Defense, develop production, build hulls, dig underground, recruit people, make them armor (50%), then when the contract ends and the validity of the armor is also (six months) - your the workers will go to the trenches, and the next contract will be fulfilled by no one.</p>\n\n<p>Such is the truth of life. There are not enough drones not only because there is no money for them, but because there is no one to work for them. And if there is someone to work for, then it is necessary to maintain a huge staff of lawyers in order to fend off the military commissars. Because the military committees have their own war.</p>\n\n<p>The problem can be solved only by the Ministry of Defense Industry (we do not have it), which will take on its balance sheet all defense enterprises - both private and state, will be engaged in the search for workers for the defense sector, their training, distribution of defense orders, development of production, research and development works .</p>\n\n<p>The logic of war will force the creation of such a ministry.

That would take Brent to the ~$65handle. But few things are monocausal and linear in markets, and the global elasticity of oil has grown slightly over the decades.

In other words, the dip in prices would most likely be temporary until compliance with the agreement resumes at least to some extent. In any case, all of that seems very unlikely to me and a far more likely interpretation is that this is a signaling mechanism to let other members of OPEC+ know that they mean business and want the others to comply and limit supply into global markets.

The official objective of the proposal is to ensure more rotation opportunities for troops currently at the front lines that have not seen rest for 6+ months.\n\nI would say that makes sense. Considering that nearly 160k people serve in the Ukrainian internal police forces, it would allow for an important influx of fresh troops for activities at the front, allowing units of the Ground Forces to replenish their losses, or they could be used to establish new units e.g. in the National Guard.

Fearing an arms race on the peninsula, America convinced South Korea in 1979 to accept limits on its rocketry technology, which can be used for both satellites and ballistic missiles. South Korea instead focused on satellite and imaging technology. As a result its first spy satellite will probably be more sophisticated than its Northern counterpart, being better able to see through cloud cover and at night. South Korea\u2019s launch capability is relatively rudimentary, even though America began easing the restrictions in 2001 and scrapped them in 2021.

Or are you talking about something else?\n\nAnyway, I agree with your first point, and I really don't know how much more Biden can do on his own here. I highly doubt he'll get anything close to the $104b Ukraine/Israel package he was asking for a month ago, but the White House, Congressional Democrats, and Senate Republicans are all on the same page with respect to Ukraine aid - they all want to send more, and they want it sent yesterday. It's the House that's the problem, and Johnson is still kind of a big question mark. Does he actually want to pass something Ukraine-related or is he just yanking everyone's chain? And if yes, *can* he get something passed considering the make-up of the House GOP? This is why it's been so difficult to make this happen, IMO - Biden is a good negotiator, but he doesn't really know the key player he's supposed to be negotiating with, and we don't know how much power the guy actually has in this debate either.",

            "body": ">That is why the argument this was to stop NATO expansion is nonsensical.\n\nI think the people making that argument(and you arguing against it) overwhelmingly focus too much on the military aspects of what NATO entails, and not on other details that matter as much(if not even more).\n\nI'll preface this that I agree with your general point, that no matter what would happen with Ukraine; a decision made to invade was always going to be worse than one where you decide not do(at least in a probabilistic sense). \nSo if Russia *was* successful with its invasion(here I think it's worth also discussing what this entails, many seem to only consider the idea of Russia conquering all of Ukraine; I think that's a drastically different scenario compared to just replacing the leadership/administration(more akin to military coup); then the benefits are quite great indeed, especially if one thinks that west/Europe would not react very strongly. The other alternative is what we have now, which you have already described well; which is really bad for Russian interests overall. From this perspective of Russia wanting xyz things, *not* invading is also a form of risk; but it is much more lesser, and while the benefits are lower it gives you a lot more opportunities. A world where Nordstream2 is operational and where many political parties that are sympathetic to Russia within Europe have come to greater power is a world where further Russian moves(such as an invasion) present less of a risk. Same goes with military preparedness, Russia changed its overall course to facilitate military capabilities a long time ago, in around ~2005 when they almost overnight paid off their IMF debts and maxed out on being fiscally conservative(IIRC the lowest debt to GDP ratio, and certainly the lowest among the bigger powers).\n\nTo return to the initial idea, it's not all about military. If one believes the general principles of 'peaceful evolution theory', which based on Putin's statements from around ~2005 onwards I think is reasonable to assume so; then the 'threat' presented to the regime is multi dimensional, of which military capabilities have perhaps become much less important compared to others; informational warfare, influencing society/culture through various ways, hybrid warfare, etc. Also, I'd say it's noteworthy that this 'theory'; which I think most political elites in the west have called a conspiracy theory, is something that China believes is a thing as well; in fact its beginnings lie in the cold war. I think it's hard to square against the idea especially if you look at what some noteworthy US-based thinkers/insiders have spoken of, especially people like George Kennan, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Paul Wolfowitz, etc. Another point of evidence that points to this being something Russia believes is a thing is to look at their military doctrine, IIRC Kofman has had some articles on that in the past.\n\nThe other big dimension is of course the economic side, I don't really want to get into that much; but it's deeply tied to social/cultural exchange for obvious reasons; and as such can be used to wage hybrid war(not just through sanctions, which is a pretty direct measure). \n\nFrom that POV, it makes sense why Ukraine being in NATO would matter a lot more to Russia compared to Finland. If NATO presented a real, tangible threat to Russia, then obviously Finland would also be on the chopping block and would have to be invaded. I think one can even argue it's in some ways a lot more important location from that perspective. The power plant powering St.Petersburg&Moscow; aka the most important places within Russia for the political elite, is much closer to the Finnish border than to the Ukrainian border. \n\n>it was purely a war conquest and they expected it to be a walk.\n\nTouched upon this before, but it's worth expanding on what you mean by conquest here. There's a difference between installing a puppet regime vs conquering a country through military means. \n\nI'd also pushback against that overall assessment, no matter which approach you think Russia chose. If Russia was simply interested in taking over Ukraine, why did it not do so before? Ukraine was weaker at every point in time between 2022, progressively so as you go further back in time. Let's not forget that tensions surrounding Crimea were already a thing in the 90s and culminated in early 2000s when agreements were made. Furthermore, Russia already breached territorial integrity of Ukraine in that same decade later on(don't exactly remember the date, IIRC around ~2007; will look into it if it's important).",

From this perspective of Russia wanting xyz things, <em>not</em> invading is also a form of risk; but it is much more lesser, and while the benefits are lower it gives you a lot more opportunities. A world where Nordstream2 is operational and where many political parties that are sympathetic to Russia within Europe have come to greater power is a world where further Russian moves(such as an invasion) present less of a risk. Same goes with military preparedness, Russia changed its overall course to facilitate military capabilities a long time ago, in around ~2005 when they almost overnight paid off their IMF debts and maxed out on being fiscally conservative(IIRC the lowest debt to GDP ratio, and certainly the lowest among the bigger powers).</p>\n\n<p>To return to the initial idea, it&#39;s not all about military. If one believes the general principles of &#39;peaceful evolution theory&#39;, which based on Putin&#39;s statements from around ~2005 onwards I think is reasonable to assume so; then the &#39;threat&#39; presented to the regime is multi dimensional, of which military capabilities have perhaps become much less important compared to others; informational warfare, influencing society/culture through various ways, hybrid warfare, etc. Also, I&#39;d say it&#39;s noteworthy that this &#39;theory&#39;; which I think most political elites in the west have called a conspiracy theory, is something that China believes is a thing as well; in fact its beginnings lie in the cold war. I think it&#39;s hard to square against the idea especially if you look at what some noteworthy US-based thinkers/insiders have spoken of, especially people like George Kennan, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Paul Wolfowitz, etc. Another point of evidence that points to this being something Russia believes is a thing is to look at their military doctrine, IIRC Kofman has had some articles on that in the past.</p>\n\n<p>The other big dimension is of course the economic side, I don&#39;t really want to get into that much; but it&#39;s deeply tied to social/cultural exchange for obvious reasons; and as such can be used to wage hybrid war(not just through sanctions, which is a pretty direct measure). </p>\n\n<p>From that POV, it makes sense why Ukraine being in NATO would matter a lot more to Russia compared to Finland. If NATO presented a real, tangible threat to Russia, then obviously Finland would also be on the chopping block and would have to be invaded. I think one can even argue it&#39;s in some ways a lot more important location from that perspective. The power plant powering St.Petersburg&amp;Moscow; aka the most important places within Russia for the political elite, is much closer to the Finnish border than to the Ukrainian border. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>it was purely a war conquest and they expected it to be a walk.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Touched upon this before, but it&#39;s worth expanding on what you mean by conquest here. There&#39;s a difference between installing a puppet regime vs conquering a country through military means. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d also pushback against that overall assessment, no matter which approach you think Russia chose. If Russia was simply interested in taking over Ukraine, why did it not do so before? Ukraine was weaker at every point in time between 2022, progressively so as you go further back in time. Let&#39;s not forget that tensions surrounding Crimea were already a thing in the 90s and culminated in early 2000s when agreements were made. Furthermore, Russia already breached territorial integrity of Ukraine in that same decade later on(don&#39;t exactly remember the date, IIRC around ~2007; will look into it if it&#39;s important).</p>\n</div>",

Mearsheimer makes another claim that he was likely one of the only people to suggest Ukraine should keep its nuclear weapons. This is at least partially correct, as he did say that. He does however, leave out the fact that he also, in the same article, claimed it would be very unlikely for Ukraine to hand their nukes over.

Mearsheimer - Why We Will Soon Miss The Cold War, August 1990](https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/politics/foreign/mearsh.htm)\n\n> The conditions that have made for decades of peace in the West are fast disappearing, as Europe prepares to return to the multi-polar system that, between 1648 and 1945, bred one destructive conflict after another\n\n> ...\n\n> Indeed, who gets nuclear weapons is likely to be the most problematic question facing the new Europe. **Three scenarios of the nuclear future in Europe are possible**.\n\n> ...\n\n>  The \"Current Ownership\" Scenario\n\n> Under this scenario Britain, France, and the **Soviet Union** retain their nuclear weapons, but no new nuclear powers emerge in Europe. **This vision of a nuclear-free zone in Central Europe** with nuclear weapons remaining on the flanks of the Continent, is also popular in Europe, but it, too, **has doubtful prospects**.\n\n> **Germany will prevent it over the long run**. The Germans are not likely to be willing to rely on the Poles or the Czechs to provide their forward defense against a possible direct Soviet conventional attack on their homeland. Nor are the Germans likely to trust the Soviet Union to refrain for all time from nuclear blackmail against a non-nuclear Germany. **Hence they will eventually look to nuclear weapons as the surest means of security, just as NATO has done.**\n\n> **The small states of Eastern Europe will also have strong incentives to acquire nuclear weapons**. Without them they would be open to nuclear blackmail by the Soviet Union, or by Germany if proliferation stopped them.

The Germans are not likely to be willing to rely on the Poles or the Czechs to provide their forward defense against a possible direct Soviet conventional attack on their homeland. Nor are the Germans likely to trust the Soviet Union to refrain for all time from nuclear blackmail against a non-nuclear Germany. <strong>Hence they will eventually look to nuclear weapons as the surest means of security, just as NATO has done.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The small states of Eastern Europe will also have strong incentives to acquire nuclear weapons</strong>. Without them they would be open to nuclear blackmail by the Soviet Union, or by Germany if proliferation stopped them. Even if those major powers did not have nuclear arsenals, no Eastern European state could match German or Soviet conventional strength.</p>\n\n<p>Clearly, then, a scenario in which current ownership continues, without proliferation, <strong>seems very unlikely</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That&#39;s the closest to the &#39;actual&#39; scenario that has happened.</p>\n\n<p>The most likely one, according to him?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The &quot;Nuclear Proliferation&quot; Scenario</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>most probable</strong> scenario in the wake of the Cold War is <strong>further nuclear proliferation in Europe</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I mean, I know most Social Sciences don&#39;t care about being wrong all that much (I guess they get used to it?), but these are some pretty important things to be wrong about - Soviet Union existing (it <strong>broke up a year after this article</strong> was out), Serbia and Albania (or any other EE countries of your choosing) having nuclear weapons, Germans having nuclear weapons, NATO not expanding its membership.</p>\n\n<p>Not only that, there&#39;s 2 other scenarios (I guess he tried to cover <strong>all</strong> the bases since future is hard to predict), which are <em>not even equally wrong</em> - they sound bat*hit insane to today&#39;s readers.</p>\n\n<p>It reads almost like a bad teenage fan fiction with the vocabulary of a college adolescent - give credit where credit is due.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Which brings me to my point - I know you&#39;ve asked about a realist argument against the invasion of Ukraine, and even though I don&#39;t have any &#39;formal or otherwise&#39; IR training, let me save you some time and offer an alternative argument against these kinds of writings in general:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>It&#39;s a bunch of pretentious hogwash that <em>sounds</em> good <strong>while it&#39;s beating around the bush</strong>, but <strong>as soon</strong> as it starts making <strong>concrete</strong> <em>predictions</em>, things start to fall apart - rapidly.

All in all, NATO expansion is not the sole reason for this war, it&#39;s a combination of several factors, but it definitely played a part.</p>\n</div>",
