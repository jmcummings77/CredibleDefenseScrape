        "body": "Could AMRAAM missiles provide stopgap missile defense capability to Ukraine?  \n\n\nAMRAAM missile is, of course, well known as an air-to-air missile.  However, it has been also adapted to be launched from surface as part of the NASAAMS system.  Ukraine has been supplied with several NASAAMS system by both Norway and United States, however the production rate is relatively slow.  In reversal of the situation with Ukraine's current S-300 system, the missiles are plentiful while launchers are scarce.    \n\n\nThis does present several possibilities, namely - is it possible to adapt AMRAAM to be fired from alternative launchers?  We have seen similar processes take place with RIM Sea Sparrow, which has been modified to be launched by SA-11 (Buk) launcher, as well as HARM anti-radiation missile which has been launched from Mig-29 hardpoints.  As far as HARM is concerned, it seems to be primarily used in \"Pre-Briefed\"* mode.\n\n\nThe Drive's Warzone did a fairly in-depth look at issues associated with mounting AIM-120 on Ukrainian aircraft (https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/arming-ukrainian-fighters-with-aim-120-missiles-is-a-complex-proposition), which I would suggest to anybody interested in the topic.\n\nI don't think anybody would be surprised to discover that there are significant difficulties associated with the prospect.  However - it strikes me that some basic functionality may be achieved by launching AIM-120 from the ground in the \"Boresight\" mode. In \"Boresight\" mode, the missile is launched without a radar lock and will lock on to the first thing it detects when activating it's seeker.  The probability of hitting the target is obviously diminished, as AMRAAM radar seeker is considerably less powerful then fighter aircraft radar.

The CP-1001B/AWG HARM Command Launch Computer (CLC) then decides which target to attack, transmits the data to the missile, and launches the AGM-88. TOO mode means that the seeker of the AGM-88 itself has detected a target, and the missile can be fired manually if the radar emission is identified as a threat. In SP and TOO modes, the AGM-88 can even be fired at targets behind the launching aicraft, although this of course significantly reduces the missile's range. The AGM-88 missile has an inbuilt inertial system, so that whenever it has acquired a lock once, it will continue towards the target even if the emitter is shut down (although the CEP is larger in this case). \nhttp://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/m-88.html",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Could AMRAAM missiles provide stopgap missile defense capability to Ukraine?  </p>\n\n<p>AMRAAM missile is, of course, well known as an air-to-air missile.  However, it has been also adapted to be launched from surface as part of the NASAAMS system.  Ukraine has been supplied with several NASAAMS system by both Norway and United States, however the production rate is relatively slow.  In reversal of the situation with Ukraine&#39;s current S-300 system, the missiles are plentiful while launchers are scarce.    </p>\n\n<p>This does present several possibilities, namely - is it possible to adapt AMRAAM to be fired from alternative launchers?  We have seen similar processes take place with RIM Sea Sparrow, which has been modified to be launched by SA-11 (Buk) launcher, as well as HARM anti-radiation missile which has been launched from Mig-29 hardpoints.  As far as HARM is concerned, it seems to be primarily used in &quot;Pre-Briefed&quot;* mode.</p>\n\n<p>The Drive&#39;s Warzone did a fairly in-depth look at issues associated with mounting AIM-120 on Ukrainian aircraft (<a href=\"https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/arming-ukrainian-fighters-with-aim-120-missiles-is-a-complex-proposition\">https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/arming-ukrainian-fighters-with-aim-120-missiles-is-a-complex-proposition</a>), which I would suggest to anybody interested in the topic.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t think anybody would be surprised to discover that there are significant difficulties associated with the prospect.  However - it strikes me that some basic functionality may be achieved by launching AIM-120 from the ground in the &quot;Boresight&quot; mode. In &quot;Boresight&quot; mode, the missile is launched without a radar lock and will lock on to the first thing it detects when activating it&#39;s seeker.  The probability of hitting the target is obviously diminished, as AMRAAM radar seeker is considerably less powerful then fighter aircraft radar.  However - if the launcher can be pointed at the direction of the cruise missile, and no friendly aircraft are in the vicinity, it seems to me that intercept is reasonably possible.  </p>\n\n<p>There exists another option, where Ukrainian AIM-120D missiles equipped with a datalink would receive targeting information from NATO AWACS aircraft.

First, it\u2019s almost certainly the case that they\u2019re getting Cs not Ds. AFAIK the USAF is still mostly using Cs, with Ds just coming online and the successor missiles still in development. Even if Ukraine is getting Ds, it\u2019s not many and still mostly Cs. Second there are physics problems with using the AAMRAM in a ground launch mode. As you point out, it can only be used with the internal seeker (pit bull mode). That\u2019s a major limitation, and likely cuts its range to about 10nmi. Making matters worse, on the deck the MAR for an AAMRAM is as little as 5mi. The lower you go the thicker the earths atmosphere, the thicker the air the less energy a missile has. You\u2019ll notice that most S2A missiles are HUGE especially compared to most A2A. The reason is primarily fuel, an S-300 needs to punch through 10k+ ft of thick air before it can begin to engage a target, while an AAMRAM launched at 30k ft will Loft to 40k or more ft and cruise through thin air before dropping on its target. It can\u2019t do that with the surface launch feature, even tho with the NASAM the AAMRAM gets a second stage booster (which is where some of the post-AAMRAM missiles are going anyway, afaik). But still the limit there in terms of range is significant, your NASAM isn\u2019t yeeting a missile up to 40k ft like an F-15 can. So we\u2019re not looking the 60nmi range of an air launched AAMRAM, and IMO the 30nmi range listed on Wikipedia would be\u2026. generous. Meanwhile the S-300 can reach out past 40nmi and the Sa-11 is comfortable in the 30mi envelope. Soviet SAMs are quite good, and purpose built. The NASAM is not, given it\u2019s a non-feature complete hack of a A2A missile. \n\nAlso reading the NASAM page reminded me of the SLAMRAM program which wanted to build an AAMRAM/Sidewinder launcher for hummers ala the Avenger.

As a result of those abuses, Kyiv will need more than just success on the battlefield to re-establish control, they said. The Russian actions, they added, suggest little interest in negotiating over the occupied areas on the part of President Vladimir Putin, who vowed to secure victory at a military parade in Moscow on Tuesday. \n\n>Russian forces \u201care engaged in filtration operations, torture and extrajudicial killings,\u201d Michael Carpenter, the US permanent representative to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, said by email. \u201cHealing the wounds of war will not be easy.\u201d\n\n> Kremlin officials have denied that Russian forces have perpetrated any human rights abuses in Ukraine while Putin himself has argued that there is no such thing as a Ukrainian national identity. The International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant against the Russian president for alleged war crimes.\n\n>The European assessment underlines how high the stakes are for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as he prepares for a counteroffensive that could be his last chance to break the Kremlin\u2019s grip on large tracts of his country. \n\n> French President Emmanuel Macron is already trying to lay the groundwork for potential negotiations between Ukraine and Russia and other European officials are starting to accept that the moment for talks may be approaching. Any appearance of support for Russian control in occupied areas will increase Putin\u2019s leverage in any negotiations.\n\n>As part of his plans to cement Russian authority over parts of Ukraine, Putin staged referendums in September in four regions which were partly controlled by his forces. The ballots were declared illegal by the United Nations and Russia has failed to establish full control over any the regions and its troops were pushed out of the southern city of Kherson in the fall. \n\n> The Russian strategy involves the systematic repression, torture and murder of Ukrainian officials, and the deportation of thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia, the officials said. The Russians have also conscripted Ukrainian men and forced them to fight their own people.\n\n>The effort to manufacture a culturally Russian population loyal to the Kremlin borrows tactics that were previously deployed in the eastern Donbas region and the Crimean peninsula after they were captured in 2014.\n\n> In those areas, the Kremlin has relocated many Russians while pro-Ukrainians have been jailed or forced to leave and the indigenous Tatar population in Crimea has faced restrictions on the use of their language and their political institutions have been banned.\n\n>In schools across the captured regions, those children who remain are taught a Kremlin-authorized version of history which eliminates their country\u2019s distinct identity. That\u2019s in line with the argument Putin made before the invasion that Ukraine is not a real country. \n\n>Putin says that the four Ukrainian regions are now part of Russia after their illegal annexations and that the local populations are loyal to Moscow. He has argued that the occupied territories are \"historically Russian lands\" and that Kremlin policies are aimed at undoing years of Ukraine's efforts to instill its \"pseudo-values.\" Before the invasion, he argued that Ukraine was an artificial country created in the Soviet era, an interpretation that historians have rejected as unfounded. On Tuesday, he accused Russia\u2019s enemies of seeking to tear his country apart. \n\n>Lyudmyla Huseynova was jailed by Russian forces in 2019 after bringing Ukrainian books to a school for orphans in her home town of Novoazovsk on Ukraine\u2019s southern coast near the pre-2014 border with Russia. She says she was accused of espionage because of pro-Ukrainian posts on social media.\n\n> \u201cI was imprisoned just for my thoughts,\u201d Huseynova, 61, said in a phone interview. \u201cThey undressed me, they touched me, they threatened to rape me \u2014 a woman who looks like their grandmother.\u201d\n\n>She said that younger women who she was in jail with were raped by the Russian guards. Huseynova said that the Russians tried to force her to vote in favor of Russian control during the illegal referendums before she was released as part of a prisoner swap late last year.\n\n> After months of training and arming Ukrainian forces with modern and heavy weaponry, allies are on alert for Ukraine\u2019s upcoming counteroffensive, expected in the coming weeks. But some of Kyiv\u2019s backers are growing skeptical the Ukrainian military will be able to make a decisive breakthrough this year because Russia\u2019s defenses have had time to dig in. Officials also stress that Ukrainian forces have repeatedly surpassed expectations, including last year when it recaptured large swathes of occupied land.\n\n>Publicly, Ukraine\u2019s allies have said negotiations should only happen on its terms, and have vowed to continue supporting the country with military aid. But some European intelligence officials are concerned that strains could emerge between Kyiv\u2019s allies.\n\n>Macron isn\u2019t alone in thinking talks should at least be considered. Asked about his efforts, Italy\u2019s chief of defense Admiral Giuseppe Cavo Dragone said at an Atlantic Council event in April that \u201canything which is changing this bad equilibrium we have over there is welcome and needs to be considered, no matter who is proposing it \u2014 anything is welcome.\u201d\n\n>While attention during the war has often focused on the military dynamics, Russia\u2019s activity behind the front-line is as just significant for the long-term future of Ukraine, the European officials said.\n\n>Its actions in the regions of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia have been well documented, culminating in the International Criminal Court issuing arrest warrants against Putin and Russia\u2019s commissioner for children\u2019s rights, Maria Lvova-Belova, accusing them of illegally deporting hundreds of children from Ukraine. Russia has kidnapped almost 20,000 minors since it launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, Zelenskiy said last month.\n\n> However, European officials are starting to articulate fears about how difficult it may be for Ukraine to govern the occupied regions - if it can reclaim them \u2013 after months of Russian abuses designed to engineer support for the Kremlin.\n\n>The focus on indoctrinating Ukrainian children with Russian propaganda demonstrates the Kremlin\u2019s long-term plans for the territories, the officials said. \n\n> In Kherson region, Russia has established at least 20 detention and torture sites where Ukrainian local government officials and protesters were sent, the European officials said. These torture sites have direct financial links to the Kremlin, according to a team of international lawyers investigating alleged Russian war crimes in Ukraine. Ukrainians involved in administrative roles or civic society have been murdered, arrested or deported.\n\n> Huseynova says a friend of hers, Vasyl Kovalenko, a businessman, was killed for removing flags of so-called separatist Donetsk People\u2019s Republic from public spaces. \u201cMany, many people were arrested and are still in prisons just for having pro-Ukrainian views,\u201d she said.\n\n>Last year, the OSCE documented direct targeting of civilians by Russian forces, attacks on medical facilities, rape, torture, summary executions, looting, and forced deportation of civilians to Russia, including children.\n\n> Moscow has also offered financial inducements to Russians to move to the regions, replacing deported Ukrainians. Those Ukrainians still living in the territories are being pressured to accept Russian passports, with residents in the occupied parts of Kherson region warned that anyone who doesn\u2019t accept one by June will be deported and have their property seized. \n\n>Declining to accept a Russian passport can see Ukrainians in the occupied territories denied access to basic public services. But of those who do accept, some are being forcibly enlisted in the Russian army.\n\n>Yale University Humanitarian Research Lab reported in February that Russia is operating \u201ca large scale, systematic network\u201d of camps that has held at least 6,000 children from Ukraine within Russia-occupied Crimea and across mainland Russia during the past year. The camps appear to be trying to indoctrinate Ukrainian children into the Russian government\u2019s idea of national culture and history, the authors said. \n\n>\u201cLet\u2019s call it what it is,\u201d British Foreign Minister James Cleverly said in a tweet on Thursday. \u201cRussia\u2019s forcible deportation of innocent Ukrainian children is a systematic attempt to erase Ukraine\u2019s future.\u201d",

Even if it's just for parade, equipment still has to be moved around. That means it's got to be transported to the parade (train, then transporter), fueled, transported *back* from the parade, and you need to maintain security throughout that chain. If you're strapped for that kind of resources, just yanking out a T-34 that runs on Diesel out of the nearest museum may not be the worst idea to keep the numbers afloat. That's not even necessarily an indication that they're strapped for logistics *everywhere* -- it's theoretically possible to keep rolling shit through Voronezh towards the West while still having trouble bringing shit *from* Voronezh to Moscow.\n\n2. A large amount of modern equipment makes all that stuff an attractive target for destruction. If anyone's managed to smuggle drones and explosive to Moscow and is in a position to use them on military equipment en route to the parade (presumably the Red Square is safe), bringing in a T-34 is not a bad way to ensure they're not going to use them -- no one's going to waste *that* on a T-34.\n\n3. The Federal government can control information dissemination on domestic channels reasonably well. I've already seen some \"don't panic\" material floating around -- e.g. claims that there's only been a tank in Moscow but the parade in Moscow isn't the only one, there've been tanks at other parades, that this was a deliberately small ceremony because after all our boys are fighting and this is no time to put on a lavish show, the lone T-34 is a symbol of our enduring spirit and so on. Being the laughing stock of the Western interwebs may not be a major concern in the government's PR team. I mean that shipped has sailed after Lavrov's second public speech or so.\n\n4. *Some* equipment may really be available only in limited quantities. Seeing it missing from a grand parade would be further indication of that; seeing it *at* the parade would be an indication that it's not deployed. Parading a lousy T-34 avoids both.\n\n5. The more equipment has to go through, the more the parade lasts, and military equipment is a big public attraction. The more people sit around while their kids drool over tanks, the more they talk to each other. Thousands of people talking to each other in the Red Square for hours is not something the Russian government would want now.\n\n6. Any equipment at the parade is, obviously, equipment that's not in Ukraine. That means anyone whose friends or relatives died in a T-72 spinning turret will blame it on whoever figured they should bring T-90s to Moscow instead of Donbas, because they'd have been perfectly safe in one of those. It doesn't matter if they're right, strictly speaking; people who lost someone dear aren't gonna stop and reason about armour thickness.\n\n7. No modern but hastily-assembled and poorly-maintained equipment in a public setting means no potential for embarrassing malfunction. \n\nI don't know if any of this is true and I hope *none* of it is true, and that this whole charade was the product of a very heated late-night meeting where Gherasimov told Putin that their options are a) a single T-34 or b) private Mikhail Sergheyevich Randomov rolling through the Red Square naked with his very erect penis painted army green so it looks like a cannon. But entertaining possibilities that you don't like is pretty useful at times like these.\n\n(For the record, I also don't like the possibility of seeing Mikhail Sergeyevich Randomov's penis, I understand why the paragraph above could be read that way)",

They funneled lots of money towards more belligerent politicians who insisted that the UK should have more freedom to pursue its economic and foreign policy, which it currently can't because its interests are at odds with those of the EU. \n\nSo in the early days of the war, when both the EU and some of its major players individually (particularly Germany) hesitated over what to do (also the result of deliberate Russian policy!), *of course* being decisively on the side of Ukraine was something that could have scored massive points for British politicians: it meant deliberately and decisely pursuing foreign policy independent of EU policy, which is exactly what a good chunk of their voters wanted. It was probably the first case of British politicians doing what they'd promised to do since... when was the last time even!?\n\nAnother facet of its political warfare game was formeting domestic unrest by propping up more \"nationalist\" figures, in part because they were the most likely to be at odds with the EU, but also because the more moderate political landscape of the nineties and early 00s left more extreme voters under-represented. \n\nWith the notable exceptions of France (unsurprising, for social-historical reasons) and Hungary (utterly baffling), that resulted in awful political outcomes for the current war. Due to the Soviet Union's legacy, no moderate nationalist voice can afford to be pro-Russian, and anyone who tries to be gets shot down left and right because, while there's been a lot of controversy about whether the EU is good or bad, controversy about whether the Soviet Union was awful is loud but numerically insignificant. The latter is largely confined to post-Soviet losers and idealistic Westerners who violently nodded in agreement as they read Marx but were spared the experience of living it out.\n\nI think this underlines the limits of political warfare based on misinformation and division: it can render some existing systems inefficient, but it can't serve to build the consensus you're after. Worse, between its inherently adversarial nature and the inherently limited mechanisms through which a free state can exert control over political parties in another free state, there's always a chance that the party you *don't* want to win will, in fact, win.\n\nFor a long time Western analysts thought the Russian political game of the 2010s was brilliant, but I suspect we will see a revision of this idea in another decade or so. It'll turn out that the Russian political and communication game was in fact very much haphazard, and lacked an overall vision: it sought to disrupt short-term political and social cohesion, and often succeeded.  But it didn't just fail to pursue long-term political support for Russia's foreign interests, it was a policy that was fundamentally unable to do so, because it was based on formenting disent based on contradictory information, rather than building a favourable system.
