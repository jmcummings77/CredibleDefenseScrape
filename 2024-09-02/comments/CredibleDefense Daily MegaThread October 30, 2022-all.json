Worth reading and clearly lays out Russias current overall strategy pretty well though I know that\u2019s been well discussed here. \n\nhttps://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-october-30\n\nKey inflections in ongoing military operations on October 30:\n\nUnconfirmed Russian reports claimed that Russian Lieutenant General Andrey Mordvichev (Commander of the 8th Combined Arms Army of the Southern Military District) replaced\nColonel General Alexander Lapin as Central Military District (CMD) commander as of October 30.\n\nRussian sources continue to make contradictory reports about whether Lapin was fully relieved of command of the CMD or just relieved of command of the Russian operational \u201cCentral Group of Forces\u201d operating in Ukraine.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense and Russian sources claimed that Russian forces repelled Ukrainian assaults on Pershotravneve, Tabaivka, and Berestove in Kharkiv Oblast.\n\nUkrainian sources and geolocated reports indicate that Russian forces destroyed a bridge over the Krasna River in Krasnorichenske, Luhansk Oblast.[16] Russian milbloggers accused Ukrainian forces of destroying the bridge.\n\nA Russian occupation official stated that Russian force are preparing to defend Kherson City by engineering defenses in Bilozerka and Chornobaivka. Ukrainian military official also noted that Russian officials continued to prepare defenses around Kherson City.\n\nUkrainian military officials reported that Russian forces are preparing to withdraw artillery units from unspecified areas on the western bank of the Dnipro River to possibly reinforce other directions.\n\nUkrainian military officials also reported that several hundred Rosgvardia servicemen deployed from the Republic of Chechnya to Kalanchak in southwestern Kherson Oblast.\n\nRussian forces continued to shell Ukrainian positions in Beryslav Raion, Kherson Oblast, and both Ukrainian and Russian sources provided limited information regarding the situation on the Kherson Oblast frontline.\n\nRussian sources claimed that Russian forces captured Vodyane, Donetsk Oblast, (4km northwest of Donetsk International Airport) on October 30. The Ukrainian General Staff\u2019s evening report did not report repelling Russian attacks in this area as it usually does, potentially indicating that the Russian claims are accurate.\n\nRussian sources reported that Russian forces captured Pavlivka, Donetsk Oblast, (2km southwest of Vuhledar) on October 30. Some Russian sources claim that Russian forces control only half of Pavlivka as of October 30. The Ukrainian General Staff\u2019s evening report did not report repelling Russian attacks in this area as it usually does, potentially indicating that the Russian claims are accurate.\n\nRussian forces launched Kh-59 cruise missiles at Ochakiv, Mykolaiv Oblast. Russian sources claimed that Russian forces targeted and destroyed military infrastructure in Ochakiv.\n\nMobilized men from Republic of Komi appealed to Russian authorities with complaints of insufficient military equipment and body armor.\n\nRussia announced its intention to supply 500,000 tons of grain to the \u201cpoorest countries\u201d following its withdrawal from the deal that allowed Ukraine to export its grain. Ukraine announced that it intends to export agricultural products to maintain global food security.\n\nUkrainian military officials reported that Russian forces continued to create conditions in Nova Kakhovka to drive local inhabitants to evacuate.\n\nOccupation authorities in Kherson Oblast announced a dual currency system that allows the use of both rubles and hryvnya, unwinding a months-long effort to enforce rubleization in the oblast.\n\nAlso, I found this interesting, regarding how winter might change things militarily \n\u201cWeather offers another likely periodization of Russian efforts that coincides well with the force-generation timelines discussed above. Fall in Ukraine is generally wet and muddy but not usually so bad as to make mechanized offensives impossible. Winter, on the other hand, is usually the best season for mechanized warfare in Ukraine. Ukrainian land is among the most fertile on earth in part because of the dense network of rivers and streams that irrigate it. That network also breaks up the land and can inhibit mechanized advances by canalizing them along roads (although both Russian and Ukrainian troops are, in principle, trained and equipped to operate on this terrain in any season, Ukrainian troops have been far more successful, in general, in doing so.) When the ground freezes hard, however, most of the streams and some of the rivers also freeze, greatly facilitating cross-country mechanized advances. Spring is the nightmare season for fighting in Ukraine. The thaw swells rivers and streams and turns fields into seas of mud. Mechanized warfare in the spring muddy season is extremely difficult (although, again, not impossible for forces like Ukraine\u2019s and, theoretically, Russia\u2019s, that are properly equipped and trained for it).\n\nThe Russian partial mobilization is thus flowing forces into Ukraine now in a way that is likely meant to stiffen Russian defenses and allow Russian forces to hold their positions against expected Ukrainian counter-offensive operations through the rest of the fall and into the dangerous winter period. If Putin intends to deploy Russian boys about to be conscripted after four or six months of training, he could be setting conditions for Russian forces to resume offensive operations after the end of the spring thaw.\u201d",

Ukrainian military official also noted that Russian officials continued to prepare defenses around Kherson City.</p>\n\n<p>Ukrainian military officials reported that Russian forces are preparing to withdraw artillery units from unspecified areas on the western bank of the Dnipro River to possibly reinforce other directions.</p>\n\n<p>Ukrainian military officials also reported that several hundred Rosgvardia servicemen deployed from the Republic of Chechnya to Kalanchak in southwestern Kherson Oblast.</p>\n\n<p>Russian forces continued to shell Ukrainian positions in Beryslav Raion, Kherson Oblast, and both Ukrainian and Russian sources provided limited information regarding the situation on the Kherson Oblast frontline.</p>\n\n<p>Russian sources claimed that Russian forces captured Vodyane, Donetsk Oblast, (4km northwest of Donetsk International Airport) on October 30. The Ukrainian General Staff\u2019s evening report did not report repelling Russian attacks in this area as it usually does, potentially indicating that the Russian claims are accurate.</p>\n\n<p>Russian sources reported that Russian forces captured Pavlivka, Donetsk Oblast, (2km southwest of Vuhledar) on October 30. Some Russian sources claim that Russian forces control only half of Pavlivka as of October 30. The Ukrainian General Staff\u2019s evening report did not report repelling Russian attacks in this area as it usually does, potentially indicating that the Russian claims are accurate.</p>\n\n<p>Russian forces launched Kh-59 cruise missiles at Ochakiv, Mykolaiv Oblast. Russian sources claimed that Russian forces targeted and destroyed military infrastructure in Ochakiv.</p>\n\n<p>Mobilized men from Republic of Komi appealed to Russian authorities with complaints of insufficient military equipment and body armor.</p>\n\n<p>Russia announced its intention to supply 500,000 tons of grain to the \u201cpoorest countries\u201d following its withdrawal from the deal that allowed Ukraine to export its grain. Ukraine announced that it intends to export agricultural products to maintain global food security.</p>\n\n<p>Ukrainian military officials reported that Russian forces continued to create conditions in Nova Kakhovka to drive local inhabitants to evacuate.</p>\n\n<p>Occupation authorities in Kherson Oblast announced a dual currency system that allows the use of both rubles and hryvnya, unwinding a months-long effort to enforce rubleization in the oblast.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I found this interesting, regarding how winter might change things militarily \n\u201cWeather offers another likely periodization of Russian efforts that coincides well with the force-generation timelines discussed above. Fall in Ukraine is generally wet and muddy but not usually so bad as to make mechanized offensives impossible. Winter, on the other hand, is usually the best season for mechanized warfare in Ukraine. Ukrainian land is among the most fertile on earth in part because of the dense network of rivers and streams that irrigate it. That network also breaks up the land and can inhibit mechanized advances by canalizing them along roads (although both Russian and Ukrainian troops are, in principle, trained and equipped to operate on this terrain in any season, Ukrainian troops have been far more successful, in general, in doing so.) When the ground freezes hard, however, most of the streams and some of the rivers also freeze, greatly facilitating cross-country mechanized advances. Spring is the nightmare season for fighting in Ukraine. The thaw swells rivers and streams and turns fields into seas of mud. Mechanized warfare in the spring muddy season is extremely difficult (although, again, not impossible for forces like Ukraine\u2019s and, theoretically, Russia\u2019s, that are properly equipped and trained for it).</p>\n\n<p>The Russian partial mobilization is thus flowing forces into Ukraine now in a way that is likely meant to stiffen Russian defenses and allow Russian forces to hold their positions against expected Ukrainian counter-offensive operations through the rest of the fall and into the dangerous winter period. If Putin intends to deploy Russian boys about to be conscripted after four or six months of training, he could be setting conditions for Russian forces to resume offensive operations after the end of the spring thaw.\u201d</p>\n</div>",

Mostly internal quibbling but hints at discontent and quotas not being met and poor equipment. \n\nBelies Shoigu\u2019s claims of almost completed mobilisation. I quote [yesterday\u2019s report:](https://notes.citeam.org/ru-dispatch-oct-28-29)\n\n>Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu reported on the implementation of the partial mobilization plan at a meeting with Vladimir Putin. He said that at the initial stage there were problems with the supply of different types of allowances, but now all these problems have been solved. Separately, Shoigu noted that special attention is paid to the training of those called up from the reserve. Currently, 218,000 people are improving their training, and 82 thousand people are already on the front line.\n\n>The dispatch of citizens called up for mobilization was completed on October 28. According to Shoigu\u2019s report, the notification of citizens has been stopped. No additional mobilization tasks are planned. (It is important that Putin\u2019s decree on the end of partial mobilization did not follow). The Federation Council stated that a decree on the end of \u201cpartial\u201d mobilization is not required.\n\n>Military commissariats within the framework of the \u201cspecial military operation\u201d will continue to recruit troops only by accepting volunteers and candidates for military service under contract.\n\n>The press service of the Western Military District said that the mobilization continues in the same mode, it was declared by presidential decree and only by presidential decree can be stopped. Later, they supplemented this statement, saying that the main partial mobilization activities in St. Petersburg were suspended.\n\n\u2026\n\nVolunteer summary on mobilization in the Russian Federation for October 29-30\n\n>Mobilization continues after its \"end\". The 23-year-old Krasnodar citizen was given a summons - he should report to the military registration and enlistment office on November 1. The mayor of Stary Oskol Andrey Chesnokov was asked on VKontakte why the city continues to post summons if the mobilization is over, to which the mayor replied that \"the statement is not a document. We're waiting.\"\n\n\n>The shipment of mobilized people continues in the Volga region and in the Orenburg region. A new echelon of mobilized servicemen after the solemn farewell went from Kazan to the Central Military District.\n\n\n>The Pomorie authorities said that the northerners called up for \"partial\" mobilization can be retrained into another military accounting specialty: they may not participate in the special operation according to the VUS specified in their military ID.\n\n\n>Families of mobilized Muscovites will receive child benefits and other payments in a simplified manner from November 1. The money will be credited to the mother's bank card, and each child is provided with a subsistence allowance.\n\n\n>6 trucks were sent from Naberezhnye Chelny with various assistance for mobilized Tatarstan citizens. Servicemen were sent basic necessities and products, a total of more than 100 tons of cargo worth about 11 million rubles.\n\n\n>\"1st Z WOMEN'S Battalion V\" from the Moscow region raises funds for the purchase of its mobilized husbands, among other things, thermal imagers, quadcopters equipped with thermal imagers, as well as collimator sights. In Khabarovsk Krai, state employees are forced to chip in to the needs of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation by order. Employees need to transfer an amount equal to daily earnings (from 1.5 to 6 thousand rubles) to the needs of Khabarovsk residents fighting in Ukraine. This is stated in a letter from the administration of Khabarovsk sent to the heads of structural units.\n\n\n>A mobilized resident of the Kursk region died of a heart attack. Back on September 22, he was sent to exercises in the Vladimir region, and today his funeral was held. Fedor Vanyukov from Krasnodar went to fight in Ukraine in the spring, signing a contract. During his vacation in September, he complained to doctors who found a bullet in his head. At the end of September, the man was mobilized, and in early October he died. Alexander Zabaluyev, a veteran of the Chechen war mobilized from Volgograd, died in Ukraine on October 24, his funeral was held yesterday.\n\n\n>Another one from a group of 12 prisoners has been identified. According to relatives, Mikhail Naidenko was mobilized from the Belgorod region on September 23-24, after which he was almost immediately sent to the Luhansk region without passing any exercises. Soon the connection with him was lost.\n\n\n>The sister of a 20-year-old mobilized from the Bryansk region said that without a medical commission and combat training as part of the 254th Motor Rifle Regiment (144th Motor Rifle Division of the 20th Combined Arms Army, mobilized soldiers from this division appeared on several videos with prisoners) was thrown to the front line in the area of Liman. Now he and other mobilized \"live and sleep in damp and cold trenches, there is no food and water, eat what they find, what is left of the last brigade, drink water from dirty puddles, the commander of their platoon issues only 1 can for four.\" Since October 8, out of 100 people in the unit, only 30 remained by October 25, the rest were killed or wounded.\n\n\n>The Astra telegram channel continues to monitor the situation with the mobilized prisoners in the Luhansk region. According to their information, about 40 servicemen who refused to return to the front line have been imprisoned for refusing to fight for about a month, and no official charges have been brought against them. They haven't been in touch with their relatives for 7 days.\n\n\n>Rusty weapons were given to those mobilized in Adygea. In the video, the servicemen demonstrate the substandard condition of the received assault rifles. Mobilized from Tomsk built a bathhouse. Someone anonymously brought them building materials as a charity.\n\n\n>The only pediatric neurosurgeon was mobilized in Sterlitamak. While the future head of the dressing department learns to throw grenades and shoot with a machine gun, children have to be taken 150 km to the Republican Hospital in Ufa.\n\n\n>Military pensioner from Sochi Roman Kharitonov spent 10 days under arrest on charges of disobeying the legitimate demands of the security forces. According to him, on the eve of his arrest, he was told to come to the military registration and enlistment office. He called and announced his refusal to mobilize, after which the police came to his house. They handcuffed him and took him to court. Now the pensioner is preparing to appeal the arrest.\n\n\n>Another attempt to set fire to the military registration and enlistment office.

Since I'm now at a keyboard I'll provide a more in-depth explanation:\n\n*First, we do not know of a true account of Ukraine's actual losses due to combat*\n\nI know I said this before, but it bears repeating: Countries have incentives to minimize their own loss figures. While the Russians are notorious about this for the current conflict- they've only publicly acknowledged a few thousand troop losses after stopping sending figures altogether. It seems clear that Russia is trying to control information at home and by not publicly acknowledging their losses, they hope to use that informational control to maintain domestic control.\n\nThere's also the the aspect of willingly concealing information so your enemy cannot use it against you. Having the enemy think that you have more assets than you actually do can make the enemy cautious and take certain desired actions. For example, in WW1, the British lost a brand-new [dreadnought battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Audacious_(1912)) early in WW1, but kept the fact concealed (officially) until after the war both to reveal weakness to the Germans, but to also not impact public morale.\n\nAdditionally, there's also the problem of availability bias. The best sources out there are publicly available pictures, and every now and then we can't even trust those. Official MoD figures tend to be laughably wrong with Russia having claimed to have destroyed the Ukrainian Air Force multiple times over.\n\n*Second, we do not know if all of the recovered vehicles can be returned to service.*\n\nMuch of the equipment abandoned by the Russians just needs fuel and it can be pressed into immediate service. Other vehicles may be stuck while others are damaged to varying degrees. Just posting a \"captured\" caption on Oryx doesn't mean that the vehicles are combat-capable. We can safely assume that many of the captured vehicles are actually being cannibalized for parts to allow other vehicles to return to service.\n\nPerun has a collab [video](https://youtu.be/sNLTE75B0Os) with the Chieftain from a month ago which talks about this in quite a bit of detail.\n\n*Third, we do not know the number of vehicles that Ukraine is able to keep into service regardless of how they entered Ukrainian service in the first place*.\n\nRelated to my second point above, but it's important enough to be a point all on its own. In short, Ukraine may have lost vehicles through mechanical attrition alone. Things break down, but you don't end up on Twitter or Telegram because your tank threw a tread, or because your T-64's engine broke down again. Maintenance of a large number of vehicle systems takes considerable logistical effort, and while we see evidence of tanks being used on the front, we don't have any information as to how many vehicles are awaiting repair back in the depot, or how many vehicles have been relegated to the scrap pile because it would take too much effort to bring it back into service.\n\n*Conclusion*\n\nIt's important that we take what we read and hear about the war in context. Us outside of actual military intelligence don't have intel on the combat and logistical capabilities of the belligerents. All we have is publicly-available imagery and some guessing. \n\nSome of those guesses can be pretty damned good, but we still have some gaps in the data. Oryx and others do a fantastic job in accounting for equipment losses, but they'd be the first ones to caution against drawing these kinds of conclusions about their data.\n\nTheir data is a starting point, but due to the gaps I've identified here, it will likely take years after the war ends before we know whether the Ukrainian active tank numbers were higher in October of 2022 than they were in February of 2022.",

Basically he suggests that the bomber offensive had so depleted SA-2 stocks that Hanoi and other strategic targets were in danger of becoming vulnerable. This helped push them into making some kind of concession (what concessions? To who? In what amount?

Veith undermines Asselin\u2019s argument by suggesting that North Vietnam basically never gave up the war after Paris and that American mistakes in securing the peace led to South Vietnam\u2019s collapse (tho Veith has a political ax to wield and so falls over himself to blame Democrats. More complicated, so know that going in). The question you can then weigh is how much Nixon\u2019s strong man diplomacy really helped end the Vietnam War.  \n\nThe other counter point is Jeffery Herf\u2019s book on the Euromissile crisis. He gets into German opposition to the deployment of Pershing missiles in the 1980s. The larger context here is of Reagan playing the cowboy with nuclear weapons and increasing MRBM deployments to counter the Soviets. A strong signal that the US would match Soviet deployments in both number and quantity. Except in Germany the idea was extremely *unpopular* because most Germans preferred detente and *Ostpolitik* over confrontation. So in that case strongman diplomacy had, probably, the intended effect on the USSR but with the unintended side effect of alienating popular support in a vital ally.
