And perhaps it is not too late to advance a view that, I believe, is not only mine alone but is shared by a number of others with extensive and in most instances more recent experience in Russian matters. The view, bluntly stated, is that expanding NATO would be the most fateful error of American policy in the entire post-cold-war era.\n> \n> \n> Such a decision may be expected to inflame the nationalistic, anti-Western and militaristic tendencies in Russian opinion; to have an adverse effect on the development of Russian democracy; to restore the atmosphere of the cold war to East-West relations, and to impel Russian foreign policy in directions decidedly not to our liking. And, last but not least, it might make it much more difficult, if not impossible, to secure the Russian Duma's ratification of the Start II agreement and to achieve further reductions of nuclear weaponry.\n> \n> It is, of course, unfortunate that Russia should be confronted with such a challenge at a time when its executive power is in a state of high uncertainty and near-paralysis. And it is doubly unfortunate considering the total lack of any necessity for this move. Why, with all the hopeful possibilities engendered by the end of the cold war, should East-West relations become centered on the question of who would be allied with whom and, by implication, against whom in some fanciful, totally unforeseeable and most improbable future military conflict?\n> \n> I am aware, of course, that NATO is conducting talks with the Russian authorities in hopes of making the idea of expansion tolerable and palatable to Russia. One can, in the existing circumstances, only wish these efforts success. But anyone who gives serious attention to the Russian press cannot fail to note that neither the public nor the Government is waiting for the proposed expansion to occur before reacting to it.\n> \n> Russians are little impressed with American assurances that it reflects no hostile intentions. They would see their prestige (always uppermost in the Russian mind) and their security interests as adversely affected. They would, of course, have no choice but to accept expansion as a military fait accompli. But they would continue to regard it as a rebuff by the West and would likely look elsewhere for guarantees of a secure and hopeful future for themselves.   \n\n[Kennan, 1997](https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/05/opinion/a-fateful-error.html)",

In \nthat eventuality, Russia would have to decide whether to \n intervene; a decision Russia does not want to have to face.   </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/08MOSCOW265_a.html\">Bill Burns, 2008</a>    </p>\n\n<p>Not specific to Ukraine, but the argument is roughly as old as the idea of post Cold War NATO expansion itself</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>But something of the highest importance is at stake here. And perhaps it is not too late to advance a view that, I believe, is not only mine alone but is shared by a number of others with extensive and in most instances more recent experience in Russian matters. The view, bluntly stated, is that expanding NATO would be the most fateful error of American policy in the entire post-cold-war era.</p>\n\n<p>Such a decision may be expected to inflame the nationalistic, anti-Western and militaristic tendencies in Russian opinion; to have an adverse effect on the development of Russian democracy; to restore the atmosphere of the cold war to East-West relations, and to impel Russian foreign policy in directions decidedly not to our liking. And, last but not least, it might make it much more difficult, if not impossible, to secure the Russian Duma&#39;s ratification of the Start II agreement and to achieve further reductions of nuclear weaponry.</p>\n\n<p>It is, of course, unfortunate that Russia should be confronted with such a challenge at a time when its executive power is in a state of high uncertainty and near-paralysis. And it is doubly unfortunate considering the total lack of any necessity for this move. Why, with all the hopeful possibilities engendered by the end of the cold war, should East-West relations become centered on the question of who would be allied with whom and, by implication, against whom in some fanciful, totally unforeseeable and most improbable future military conflict?</p>\n\n<p>I am aware, of course, that NATO is conducting talks with the Russian authorities in hopes of making the idea of expansion tolerable and palatable to Russia. One can, in the existing circumstances, only wish these efforts success. But anyone who gives serious attention to the Russian press cannot fail to note that neither the public nor the Government is waiting for the proposed expansion to occur before reacting to it.</p>\n\n<p>Russians are little impressed with American assurances that it reflects no hostile intentions. They would see their prestige (always uppermost in the Russian mind) and their security interests as adversely affected. They would, of course, have no choice but to accept expansion as a military fait accompli. But they would continue to regard it as a rebuff by the West and would likely look elsewhere for guarantees of a secure and hopeful future for themselves.   </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/05/opinion/a-fateful-error.html\">Kennan, 1997</a></p>\n</div>",

Posting from a point of view that considers Israel to be broadly in the right is not against the rules.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Try reading the rules then. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Please do not blindly advocate for a side in a conflict, <strong>or a country in general. Surely there are many patriots here, but this is not the arena</strong> to fight those battles. </p>\n\n<p><strong>No blind partisanship.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I guess there is a disconnect between the rules and how alot of people browsing are interacting. You&#39;re not supposed to say Israel has &quot;POWs and Detainees&quot; while Hamas has &quot;Kidnapped Israeli victims&quot;. That is incredibly biased in favor of one side, but seen as &quot;ok&quot; in this subreddit as an example.</p>\n</div>",
