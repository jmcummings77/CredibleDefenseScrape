Well, it happens a lot. Drones are frequently lost to EW (which can be transported on someone\u2019s back) as well as small arms.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You can add &#39;lost to other drones&#39; as well, ha! Just yesterday went looking around Andrew Perpetua&#39;s Twitter for videos of drone on drone combat and compiled a list with what I believe is all of the drone-on-drone footage from his Twitter page from late 2022 to this month.</p>\n\n<p>Figure this would be as good as time and place as any to plug it as a bit of an expanded piece of trivia regarding this war:</p>\n\n<p><a

With when Japan colonized Korea, they divided the country into the North and the South regions, with the North prioritized on industrialization (concentrated mostly in North Hamgyong, South Hamgyong and Pyongyang) while the South focused on agriculture.\n\nThe post-Korean War rebound was real. Non aligned media in the 1960s called North Korea an \u201ceconomic miracle of the Far East\u201d and compared favorably with post-war Japan\u2019s reconstruction.North Korean GDP per capita in the 1960s was higher than the GDP per capita of China and South Korea. Them and Japan were the best performing East Asian nations for a time by many economic and industrial metrics. North Korea in the 1960s to the 1980s was a confident, industrialized nation. South Korea did not overtake the North until after the mid-1970s.\n\n. By the late 1960s, North Korean rural villages were fully electrified. The per capita electric consumption in the 1970s was 5 times that of China\u2019s! The first Chinese province to be fully electrified was Shandong province in 1996, and nationwide electrification was only achieved in 2015 - the last province being Qingdao.\n\nUrbanization rates were also very high ,reaching close to \\~70% before going back down after the 90s.\n\nBy the late 1980s, 70% of North Korean agriculture was fully mechanized. By 1984, it broke a record of 10 million ton of grain production, almost doubling their food production in just over a decade!\n\nThe North Koreans built the\u00a0[Nampo Dam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nampo_Dam)\u00a0(West Sea Barrage) in just 5 years, from 1981 to 1986, with a cost of $4 BILLION dollars.

Tens of thousands of North Koreans also went and studied in the USSR, Yugoslavia and other eastern bloc countries through exchange programs in the graduate and post graduate level. Hundreds of thousands were trained there in various trades and participated in large scale soviet engeeniring projects (not in the modern understanding of them being used as \"slave\" labourers.\n\nThe main issue is that\u00a0North Korea itself does not have energy self-sufficiency. Its farming activities were highly mechanized, which means that it needs to consume a huge quantity of fossil fuel to sustain the agricultural production. North Korean economy thus became over-dependent on fossil fuel, which it doesn\u2019t produce itself and that extended for their entire industrial sector. This was not a problem when the USSR was able to provide ample supply of cheap oil to the DPRK, however as the USSR became entangled in the war in Afghanistan and the Middle East in the 1980s, its dwindling economy could no longer support the North Korean economy as it used to.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the USSR in the 1990s, fuel export to North Korea plummeted, and the North Koreans soon found themselves in a crisis of energy shortage. Trade plummeted from 53% with the USSR to merely 3% with Russia in 1995.
