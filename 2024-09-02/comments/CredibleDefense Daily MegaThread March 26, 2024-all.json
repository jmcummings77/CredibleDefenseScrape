        "body": "The [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/18/business/media/russia-fake-journalists.html) has a long-form article on Russian disinformation campaigns related to Ukraine. Previously, the [WaPo](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/02/16/russian-disinformation-zelensky-zaluzhny/) had a stellar report, based on the Kremlin's internal documents, on the breadth and depth of these operations. This current report focuses on one such campaign, but with some larger takeaways. Excerpts:\n\n\n>A young man calling himself Mohamed al-Alawi appeared in a YouTube video in August. He described himself as an investigative journalist in Egypt with a big scoop: The mother-in-law of Ukraine\u2019s president had purchased a villa near Angelina Jolie\u2019s in El Gouna, a resort town on the Red Sea.\n\n>The story, it turned out, was not true. Ukraine denied it, and the owner of the villa refuted it. Also disconnected from reality: Alawi\u2019s claim to being a journalist.\n\n>Still, his story caromed through social media and news outlets from Egypt to Nigeria and ultimately to Russia \u2014 which, according to researchers, is where the story all began.\n\n>The story seemed to fade, but not for long. Four months later, two new videos appeared on YouTube. They said Mohamed al-Alawi had been beaten to death in Hurghada, a town about 20 miles south of El Gouna. The suspected killers, according to the videos: Ukraine\u2019s secret service agents.\n\n>These claims were no more factual than the first, but they gave new life to the old lie. Another round of posts and news reports ultimately reached millions of internet users around the world, elevating the narrative so much that it was **even echoed by members of the U.S. Congress** while debating continued military assistance to Ukraine.\n\n>Ever since its forces invaded two years ago, Russia has unleashed a torrent of disinformation to try to discredit Ukraine\u2019s leader, Volodymyr Zelensky, and undermine the country\u2019s support in the West.\n\n>This saga, though, introduced a new gambit: a protracted and elaborately constructed narrative built online around a fictitious character and embellished with seemingly realistic detail and a plot twist worthy of Netflix.\n\n>\u201cThey never brought back a character before,\u201d said Darren Linvill, a professor and director of the Media Forensics Hub at Clemson University, who has extensively studied Russian disinformation.\n\n>The campaign shows how deftly Russia\u2019s information warriors have shifted to new tactics and targets as the war in Ukraine has dragged on, just as Russian forces on the ground in Ukraine have adjusted tactics after devastating battlefield losses.\n\n>Groups with ties to the Kremlin continue to float new narratives when old ones fail to stick or grow stale, using fake or altered videos or recordings and finding or creating new outlets to spread disinformation, including ones purporting to be American news sites.\n\n>The Russians have \u201cdemonstrated adaptability through the war on Ukraine,\u201d Microsoft wrote in a recent report that disclosed Russia\u2019s fraudulent use of recorded messages by famous actors and celebrities on the Cameo app to try to smear Mr. Zelensky as a drug addict.\n\n>**Even when debunked, fabrications like these have proved exceedingly difficult to extinguish entirely.**\n\n>What links the narratives to Russia is not only the content disparaging Ukraine but also the networks that circulate them. They include news outlets and social media accounts that private and government researchers have linked to previous Kremlin campaigns.\n\n>\u201cThey\u2019re trolling for a susceptible (and seemingly abundant) slice of citizens who amplify their garbage enough to muddy the waters of our discourse, and from there our policies,\u201d said Rita Katz, the director of the SITE Intelligence Group, an American company that tracks extremist activity online and investigated the false claims about the villa.\n\n>Within days, reports about the villa appeared on X in French and Romanian, and in English on three different Reddit forums.\n\n>According to Roberta Duffield, director of intelligence for Blackbird.AI, an internet security company, nearly 29 percent of the accounts amplifying the reports appeared to be inauthentic bots, an unusually high number that would normally indicate a coordinated campaign.\n\n>Eight days after the video appeared, Russia state television networks like Channel One, Rossiya 24 and RT (in Arabic and German) reported it as a major revelation uncovered by a renowned Egyptian investigative journalist.\n\n>Still, according to the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, posts about the supposed killing were viewed a million times on X on Dec. 25.\n\n>It also appeared on the website of the Middle East Monitor, or MEMO, operated by a well-known nonprofit organization in London and financed by the government of Qatar. A journalist who once reported from Moscow for The Telegraph of London, Ben Aris, cited it at length on the platform, though, when challenged, he said he had just made note of the rumor. \u201cI don\u2019t have time to check all this stuff myself,\u201d he wrote.\n\n>It appeared in English on a site, Clear Story News, that Mr. Linvill of Clemson\u2019s  Media Forensics Hub had previously linked to Russia\u2019s disinformation efforts. (The site lists no contact information)\n\n>Mr. Linvill described the process as a form of **\u201cnarrative laundering\u201d** \u2014 moving false claims from unknown or not credible sources to ones that, to the unwitting at least, seem more legitimate.\n\n>The ramifications of these campaigns are difficult to measure precisely. There are signs, though, that they resonate even when proved false.\n\n>Senator J.D. Vance, a Republican of Ohio and an outspoken critic of Ukraine aid, seemed to embrace the claim in December during an interview on \u201cWar Room,\u201d the podcast hosted by Stephen K. Bannon, the onetime adviser to former President Donald J. Trump.\n\n>\u201cThere are people who would cut Social Security \u2014 throw our grandparents into poverty \u2014 why?\u201d Mr. Vance said. \u201cSo that one of Zelensky\u2019s ministers can buy a bigger yacht?\u201d\n\n>That prompted a public rebuke this month from a Republican colleague, Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who ridiculed those who repeat unproven allegations.\n\n>\u201cThey\u2019ve heard somebody say that if we pass this bill, that we\u2019re all going to go ride to Kyiv with buckets full of money and let oligarchs buy yachts!\u201d he said of critics of the assistance to Ukraine, in what he later called a reference to Mr. Vance\u2019s comments. \u201cI wonder how the spouses of the estimated 25,000 soldiers in Ukraine who have died feel about that? I mean, really, guys?\u201d\n\nThe NYT also has a fresh report on this disinformation going into overdrive with recent events:\n\n>[Rocked by Deadly Terror Attack, Kremlin Amps Up Disinformation Machine](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/26/world/europe/russia-terror-attack-ukraine.html)\n\nPreviously, the [AP](https://apnews.com/article/russia-election-trump-immigration-disinformation-tiktok-youtube-ce518c6cd101048f896025179ef19997) had reporting on Russian disinformation campaigns around the Mexico border, Texas, and the 'civil war' narrative:\n\n>[Russian disinformation is about immigration. The real aim is to undercut Ukraine aid](https://apnews.com/article/russia-election-trump-immigration-disinformation-tiktok-youtube-ce518c6cd101048f896025179ef19997)\n\n>\n\n\nAnd the NYT again:\n\n>[Spate of Mock News Sites With Russian Ties Pop Up in U.S.](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/07/business/media/russia-us-news-sites.html)\n\n>Into the depleted field of journalism in America, a handful of websites have appeared in recent weeks with names suggesting a focus on news close to home: D.C. Weekly, the New York News Daily, the Chicago Chronicle and a newer sister publication, the Miami Chronicle.\n\n>In fact, they are not local news organizations at all. They are Russian creations, researchers and government officials say, meant to mimic actual news organizations to push Kremlin propaganda by interspersing it among an at-times odd mix of stories about crime, politics and culture.\n\n>While Russia has long sought ways to influence public discourse in the United States, the fake news organizations \u2014 at least five, so far \u2014 represent a technological leap in its efforts to find new platforms to dupe unsuspecting American readers. The sites, the researchers and officials said, could well be the foundations of an online network primed to surface disinformation ahead of the American presidential election in November.\n\n>The campaign, the experts and officials say, appears to involve remnants of the media empire once controlled by Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, a former associate of President Vladimir V. Putin whose troll factory, the Internet Research Agency, interfered in the 2016 presidential election between Donald J. Trump and Hillary Rodham Clinton.",

Trump.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThere are people who would cut Social Security \u2014 throw our grandparents into poverty \u2014 why?\u201d Mr. Vance said. \u201cSo that one of Zelensky\u2019s ministers can buy a bigger yacht?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>That prompted a public rebuke this month from a Republican colleague, Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who ridiculed those who repeat unproven allegations.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ve heard somebody say that if we pass this bill, that we\u2019re all going to go ride to Kyiv with buckets full of money and let oligarchs buy yachts!\u201d he said of critics of the assistance to Ukraine, in what he later called a reference to Mr. Vance\u2019s comments. \u201cI wonder how the spouses of the estimated 25,000 soldiers in Ukraine who have died feel about that? I mean, really, guys?\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The NYT also has a fresh report on this disinformation going into overdrive with recent events:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/26/world/europe/russia-terror-attack-ukraine.html\">Rocked by Deadly Terror Attack, Kremlin Amps Up Disinformation Machine</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Previously, the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-election-trump-immigration-disinformation-tiktok-youtube-ce518c6cd101048f896025179ef19997\">AP</a> had reporting on Russian disinformation campaigns around the Mexico border, Texas, and the &#39;civil war&#39; narrative:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-election-trump-immigration-disinformation-tiktok-youtube-ce518c6cd101048f896025179ef19997\">Russian disinformation is about immigration. The real aim is to undercut Ukraine aid</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And the NYT again:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/07/business/media/russia-us-news-sites.html\">Spate of Mock News Sites With Russian Ties Pop Up in U.S.</a></p>\n\n<p>Into the depleted field of journalism in America, a handful of websites have appeared in recent weeks with names suggesting a focus on news close to home: D.C. Weekly, the New York News Daily, the Chicago Chronicle and a newer sister publication, the Miami Chronicle.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, they are not local news organizations at all. They are Russian creations, researchers and government officials say, meant to mimic actual news organizations to push Kremlin propaganda by interspersing it among an at-times odd mix of stories about crime, politics and culture.</p>\n\n<p>While Russia has long sought ways to influence public discourse in the United States, the fake news organizations \u2014 at least five, so far \u2014 represent a technological leap in its efforts to find new platforms to dupe unsuspecting American readers. The sites, the researchers and officials said, could well be the foundations of an online network primed to surface disinformation ahead of the American presidential election in November.</p>\n\n<p>The campaign, the experts and officials say, appears to involve remnants of the media empire once controlled by Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, a former associate of President Vladimir V. Putin whose troll factory, the Internet Research Agency, interfered in the 2016 presidential election between Donald J. Trump and Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Gee, I wonder why an anti-nuclear group might have bad things to say about a nuclear weapons program?\n\nThe underlying contention is fairly common outside of that article though, but I never understood why everyone kicks off over this. Given the depth of the co-operation between the two countries in nuclear matters basically since the beginning, is it really so unreasonable that we bought a lot of American equipment to use in the deterrent? Like, what's the actual _concern_? Usually people say one or more of these:\n\n1) **The US could pull the plug at any moment.** Yeah, sure, they could in theory do that...but that's probably less likely than an actual nuclear war. Say it happened though, what would the effect on us be? In the long term it's not like we couldn't build our own SLBMs and re-entry vehicles if we had to, so we could regenerate the deterrent there. In the short to medium term we're stuck holding a bunch of Trident (we own 46 missiles now out of the original 58 purchased, having expended 12 in test fires) we suddenly need to maintain ourselves. The [sales agreement](https://www.nuclearinfo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Polaris-Sales-Agreement-1963.pdf) for Polaris, which was extended to cover Trident, includes (Article III, Paragraph 2.e.(iii/iv)) a whole host of things that ought to enable us to do that:\n\n> (iii) construction spares and spare parts adequate in scope and quantity to ensure the continued maintenance of the equipment specified in subparagraph a, b, c, d, e(i) and e(ii) of this paragraph.\n>    \n> (iv) (a) latest available United States technical documentation including specifications, blueprints and manuals covering the missiles and equipment listed in a, b, c, d, e(i) and e(ii)  or this paragraph in sufficient scope and quantity to cover safety requirements and permit successful transport, installation, operation, **and maintenance** by the Government of the United Kingdom of all equipment purchased under the terms of this Agreement.   \n>    \n> latest available United States technical documentation, as may be necessary from time to time in individual cases, to permit manufacture by the Government of the United Kingdom to the extent necessary for the maintenance, repair and modification of the items listed in subparagraph a, b, c, d, e(i) and e(ii) of this paragraph.\n\nAnd it's not like we haven't done that before - [we maintained Polaris](https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/1967-01-18/debates/88c5ce82-0006-4849-8050-004147739936/PolarisMissiles(Maintenance\\)) at Coulport until 1996 and even modified it heavily for Chevaline. Whilst it would **suck**, seriously severely **suck**, withdrawal of American support should not, unless I'm missing something, leave the UK without a nuclear deterrence.\n\n2) **The reliance on the US means we're \"not operationally independent\"**. This is usually an insistence that we couldn't fire Trident without American approval, as Politico asserts in that article:\n\n> \u201cIn practice, though, it is difficult to conceive of any situation in which a prime minister would fire Trident without prior US approval\u2026 the only way that Britain is ever likely to use Trident is to give legitimacy to a US nuclear attack by participating in it,\u201das was the case in the invasion of Iraq.\n\n...but that just doesn't make sense. It's a complaint that we couldn't use the system to first-strike someone; when on earth would we ever want to do that? I can't imagine any scenario in which we end up using Trident outside of a response to an attack on the UK or a close ally, but in that event why would it be difficult to conceive of a situation in which we would need US approval? Either they're on our side in whatever cataclysmic war has necessitated a nuclear response, in which case they either have no objections or already fired back themselves, or they're not...in which case why would we still care about their lack of approval?\n\nSo can't we just enjoy the equivalent to the French deterrent [but for half the cost](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn04079/) and spend the money on something else?\n\n-------------------\n\nSome minor technical difficulties with Politico's article that I thought worth addressing:\n\n> The report makes for striking reading. The UK does not even own its Trident missiles, but rather leases them from the United States\n\nNo; [we bought them](https://www.nuclearinfo.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Polaris-Sales-Agreement-1963.pdf) - 58 of them to be exact, of which 46 remain after test flights. Politico clearly didn't actually read the [White Paper](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a78ebe3e5274a277e690804/DefenceWhitePaper2006_Cm6994.pdf) they're referencing, because it clearly disproves that claim:\n\n> In the 1998 Strategic Defence Review we announced that we had by then purchased 58 Trident D5 missiles. Subsequently, we decided not to take up an option to purchase an additional seven missiles. As a result of a number of test firings, our current holding  has reduced to 50. We believe that no further procurement of Trident D5 missiles will be necessary through its planned in-service life.\n\nThey also claim (because Greenpeace said so) the US can stop us using Trident by turning off the GPS:\n\n> The USA has the ability to deny access to GPS (as well as weather and gravitational data) at any time, rendering that form of navigation and targeting useless if the UK were to launch without US approval.\n\nTrident does not use GPS guidance; it would be pretty poor planning to build your armageddon weapon with the assumption that the satellites still work. It uses [astro-intertial guidance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_guidance#Astro-inertial_guidance) - good luck switching off the stars and physics, yanks!\n\nOne point of agreement though:\n\n> The UK is the only nuclear weapon state that operates a single deterrent capability\n\nThis does suck. We supposedly load some Trident on Vanguard with single warheads configured for low-yield to fill the sub-strategic role but I firmly believe that's not a credible threat, since firing would reveal the Vanguard's position. It sucks, but I think we probably ought to build either an upgraded bomb or a cruise missile that can be used to deter sub-strategic use of nuclear weapons too - for that we genuinely are dependent on the US.",

So this system makes sense if the time between detection by Allied assests and relayed commands to air defenses is too long.</p>\n</div>",

Expanding production of Patriots as much as possible should clearly be a top priority.\n\nThe S400 is not really designed around taking down cruise missiles as much as other Russian \"IADS\" with layers of different SAM systems suitable for threats.

If there is a defined end I think the new law is suggesting three years, then there is an end to their service and people will be more likely to sign up. \n\n2. Mandatory minimum training has to be lengthened. I think the officer said it should be two to three months the new law makes it two.

Some people want to serve in brigades from their area. I know a lot of Marines come from Odessa and a new recruit may want to serve in the Marines for that reason. In the current system they get sent to wherever the general staff needs to fill holes which makes people already nervous to serve not want to serve. \n\n4.
