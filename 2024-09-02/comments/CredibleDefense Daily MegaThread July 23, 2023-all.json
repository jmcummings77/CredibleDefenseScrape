The difference is that today the concentration of forces in this sector generally speaking is enormously greater than in September, there are no Ukrainian formations to be caught by surprise and ready to flee and successes of that kind are in fact extremely unlikely.\n\nI might regret it, but I still don't see Ukrainian positions on the eastern side of the Oskil at risk, at least if the Ukrainians don't decide on their own to withdraw - totally unexpected from them.

I just don\u2019t see why the counteroffensive was seen as a good idea. The situation in which it works is if Ukraine switches tactics(they already have it seems like) and to slowly push back the Russians by destroying enough of their forces or just strain their logistics until it\u2019s untenable, similar to Kherson.</p>\n</div>",

The point is not that bombing does not decrease production, it obviously does. The point is that it is very difficult to stop production and/or keep it low.

In terms of help, the only help that the ROK heavily relies upon is that of the US, and Uncle Sam is never going to abandon the ROK over its current Ukraine policy.\n\nThe DPRK isn't anywhere near the level of Russia in terms of having the resources to sustain a long term conventional war. On paper they have a huge amount of assets at the border, but the DPRK has been strapped for fuel for literally decades, its economy is inefficient and hollowed out, and its industrial capacity is not great. In the event of a ROK-DPRK hostilities, the Korean War 2.0 is very much not going to look like this Russia-Ukraine thing that's going on. In the video, Perun notes that the ROK estimates that the DPRK has ~3months of stockpiles in reserve in the event of a full conventional war. \n\nInstead of DPRK tank columns and Artillery trying to blow their way through the DMZ, it's more likely that the Korean War 2.0 will be characterized by massive artillery and missile duels, ROK/US airpower trying to suppress the DPRK ballistic missile and artillery assets, and missile defense systems trying desperately to prevent nuclear strikes on South Korean urban areas. Instead of the long drawn out affair we are seeing in Ukraine, it will be a supremely nasty, brutish, and short conventional phase and probably without much warning. \n\nIn this threat environment, European aid a few weeks or months down the line isn't going to make or break anything, but even outdated artillery assets right then and there could potentially save lives (we've seen in Ukraine that massed fires are still extremely useful, and older tubes still have their uses). The ROK isn't going to be relying on a web of alliances like European Countries do within NATO - the ROK is primarily concerned with maintaining its close military defense arrangements with the US, with a secondary objective at maintaining a working relationship with Japan (as Perun notes, it isn't likely going to be anything more than that in the near or medium term). On the other hand, a potentially vengeful Russia could arm, fuel, or fund the DPRK - something that could make the conventional phase of the Korean War 2.0 longer, or deadlier than it would have been. For example, a couple of S-300s or just one S-400 system could throw a huge wrench in attempts to achieve air superiority within the first day of hostilities. \n\nWhile I wouldn't go as far as to say that the ROK doesn't see any value in maintaining good relations with Europe, I would say that compared to the value of not having terrible relations with Russia, a potential minor loss European goodwill is a fair exchange from the perspective of the ROK.\n\nTerminology:\n\nDPRK - Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea)\n\nROK - Republic of Korea (South Korea)",

Instead of the long drawn out affair we are seeing in Ukraine, it will be a supremely nasty, brutish, and short conventional phase and probably without much warning. </p>\n\n<p>In this threat environment, European aid a few weeks or months down the line isn&#39;t going to make or break anything, but even outdated artillery assets right then and there could potentially save lives (we&#39;ve seen in Ukraine that massed fires are still extremely useful, and older tubes still have their uses). The ROK isn&#39;t going to be relying on a web of alliances like European Countries do within NATO - the ROK is primarily concerned with maintaining its close military defense arrangements with the US, with a secondary objective at maintaining a working relationship with Japan (as Perun notes, it isn&#39;t likely going to be anything more than that in the near or medium term). On the other hand, a potentially vengeful Russia could arm, fuel, or fund the DPRK - something that could make the conventional phase of the Korean War 2.0 longer, or deadlier than it would have been. For example, a couple of S-300s or just one S-400 system could throw a huge wrench in attempts to achieve air superiority within the first day of hostilities. </p>\n\n<p>While I wouldn&#39;t go as far as to say that the ROK doesn&#39;t see any value in maintaining good relations with Europe, I would say that compared to the value of not having terrible relations with Russia, a potential minor loss European goodwill is a fair exchange from the perspective of the ROK.</p>\n\n<p>Terminology:</p>\n\n<p>DPRK - Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea (North Korea)</p>\n\n<p>ROK - Republic of Korea (South Korea)</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/23/world/europe/weary-soldiersunreliable-munitions-ukraines-many-challenges.html\n\nThe headquarters of one of the battalions in Ukraine\u2019s 53rd Mechanized Brigade smells of fresh cut pine trees. The scents are from the wooden support beams in the labyrinth of trenches that make up most of the unit\u2019s rudimentary base outside the embattled town of Avdiivka.\n\nIn the main command room, flat-screen televisions, computers and satellite internet pipe in images from small drones, as a cadre of Ukrainian soldiers keeps tabs on their portion of the front line.\n\nWhat they mostly see is a violent stalemate.\n\nAs the war enters its 17th month, the fighting has developed a noticeable rhythm. Russia and Ukraine are locked in a deadly back and forth of attacks and counterattacks. Russian artillery no longer has the clear advantage and Ukrainian forces are struggling with staunch Russian defenses, grinding on in their southern offensive, slowed because of dense minefields.\n\nSmall territorial gains come at an outsize cost. Field hospitals that were closed after the battle for the eastern city of Bakhmut have been reopened, volunteers said, and Ukrainian soldiers described a determined foe.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trading our people for their people and they have more people and equipment,\u201d said one Ukrainian commander whose platoon has suffered around 200 percent casualties since Russia launched its full-scale invasion last year.\n\nThis New York Times analysis of the war is based on a dozen visits to the front line and interviews in June and July with Ukrainian soldiers and commanders in the Donetsk and Kharkiv regions, where many of the battles are being fought.\n\nThose visits showed the Ukrainian military facing a litany of new and enduring challenges that have contributed to its slow progress.\n\nUkraine has done well to adapt a defensive war \u2014 wiring Starlink satellite internet, public software and off-the-shelf drones to keep constant tabs on Russian forces from command points. But offensive operations are different: Ukraine has made marginal progress in its ability to coordinate directly between its troops closest to Russian forces on the so-called zero line and those assaulting forward.\n\nUkrainian infantry are focusing more and more on trench assaults, but after suffering tens of thousands of casualties since the war\u2019s start, these ranks are often filled with lesser-trained and older troops. And when Russian forces are driven from a position, they have become more adept at targeting that position with their artillery, ensuring Ukrainian troops cannot stay there long.\n\nAmmunition is in short supply, and there is a mixture of munitions sent from different countries. That has forced Ukrainian artillery units to use more ammunition to hit their targets, Ukrainian soldiers said, because accuracy varies widely between the various shells. In addition, some of the older shells and rockets sent from abroad are damaging their equipment and injuring soldiers. \u201cIt\u2019s a very big problem now,\u201d said Alex, a Ukrainian battalion commander.\n\nFinally, in the summer months, camouflage and greenery remain crucial factors in whether a battlefield operation will be successful. Defending forces almost always have the advantage, whether because of unseen trenches or hidden electronic warfare units that use deceit and concealment to throw off attacking forces.\n\nThe setup the soldier named Valerii was watching in the command center is common among a majority of Ukrainian units fighting in the east. Unlike the United States and other NATO countries that use intricate military communication equipment to monitor the battlefield, Ukrainian troops use less sophisticated, but easier-to-use programs like smartphone messaging apps, private internet chat rooms and small Chinese-made drones to watch the goings on along the front line.\n\nIt is an ad hoc, but effective, communication suite that is overlaid with homegrown Ukrainian software, providing the location of Ukrainian units and suspected positions of Russian forces.\n\nThe downside of this system is that it is almost entirely tethered to Starlink satellite internet. That means when Ukrainian units are assaulting \u2014 absent a Wi-Fi router \u2014 it takes longer to communicate important information like artillery targets because attacking troops have to reach someone with an internet connection to call for support.\n\nUkrainian troops are also contending with Russian forces jamming the radios that soldiers are using to try to reach their comrades with internet.\n\n\u201cMostly we receive coordinates via the internet \u2014 it is secure, and as soon as they are transmitted to us, we use them immediately,\u201d said Anton, the head of an automatic grenade launcher unit.\n\nIn one case in the country\u2019s south this year, soldiers fighting for Ukraine tried to wire Starlink internet to an armored troop transport as they assaulted a Russian position, but the antenna was shot by friendly fire during the attack.\n\nThis month, the system worked as intended. A Ukrainian drone watched as the dirt from a Russian soldier\u2019s shovel piled up next to a trench he was digging: It was a priority target. A new trench meant Russian forces were getting that much closer to Ukrainian lines and would be one more fortification for Ukrainian forces to assault.\n\nThe coordinates for the trench were sent via smartphone, and minutes later explosions from a Mk 19 automatic grenade launcher erupted on either side of the Russian soldier.\n\nThe squad of Ukrainian soldiers from the 59th brigade were soaked through with sweat. It was the end of June and they had performed the same drill \u2014 assaulting a trench used for training, only miles from the front line \u2014 countless times, navigating through the overgrown grass, fake-firing their Kalashnikovs, resting and doing it all over again.\n\nThe aim of the repetition was to make the process mechanical, so when the new group of mobilized soldiers, aged 25 to 40, finally made it to the front line, they would not flinch when it came time to attack a well-defended Russian trench.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t been in active combat yet but we are preparing for it,\u201d said Mykola, one of the younger soldiers in the group.\n\nWith the war in its second year and both armies well-versed in constructing and defending fortifications, assaulting trenches has become one of the most dangerous and necessary tasks for Ukrainian troops trying to retake territory. Training for more specialized skills, such as for snipers, has been sidelined in favor of trench attacks.\n\nAround the eastern city of Bakhmut, which was captured by the Russians in May, Ukrainian forces have made progress on the city\u2019s flanks because Russian forces have had less time to dig in. Some elite Ukrainian units in the area are proficient in attacking Russian trenches with good communication and coordinated assaults.\n\nBut other Ukrainian formations elsewhere on the front have had trouble filling their ranks with the caliber of soldiers capable of carrying out successful trench attacks, given that months of fighting have exhausted their ranks. New replacements are sometimes older recruits who were mobilized.\n\n\u201cHow can you expect a 40-year-old to be a good infantry soldier or machine-gunner?\u201d asked the Ukrainian commander whose platoon had taken dozens of casualties. Youth not only means better physical prowess, but younger soldiers are less likely to question orders.\n\nIn recent days around Bakhmut, Ukrainian casualties have mounted, a byproduct of Ukraine\u2019s strategy to tie up Russian forces around the city to complement the counteroffensive in the country\u2019s south. Russian forces have rushed more artillery units to the area so that even if they lose a trench to a Ukrainian assault, they can quickly shower their lost fortifications with shells, forcing Kyiv\u2019s troops to retreat from newly recaptured ground.\n\nOutside the eastern town of Siversk, a team of Ukrainian troops manning a U.S.-supplied 105 mm howitzer listened to its \u201cneighbor,\u201d a self-propelled howitzer, fire several rounds. Then the 105 mm\u2019s team received its own fire mission, via smartphone and Starlink internet, targeting a Russian mortar team.\n\nThe crew peeled back its camouflage netting, fired twice, and then concealed again.\n\nThe fire mission was successful. But for many Ukrainian artillery units, it is not that simple.\n\nUkrainian artillery crews are navigating an assortment of munitions delivered from countries like Pakistan, Poland, Bulgaria and Iran, forcing gun crews to adjust their aim based on which country the ammunition comes from and sometimes how old it is, even though it is all the same caliber.\n\nFrequent artillery fire almost always brings retaliation. Twenty minutes after a Ukrainian 105 mm fired a salvo, the Russians fired back, showering the area with cluster munitions, a class of shells and rockets that explode and distribute smaller explosives over a wide area. Both Russia and Ukraine have used the weapons, though many countries ban them.\n\nThe Russians used cluster munitions, the gun crew said, because they did not know exactly where the Ukrainians were, so they opted instead to blanket the area with the small exploding bombs with the hopes of hitting their target somewhere among the trees.\n\nOne of the defining features of summer combat in eastern Ukraine is the foliage. Covering a tank or artillery piece with camouflage is called \u201cmasking\u201d by the Ukrainians, and the routine is critical to avoid detection from drones and the artillery fire that is sure to follow. Around Bakhmut, the fields and tree lines are known among Ukrainian troops as the \u201cgreen zone.\u201d",

Russian forces have rushed more artillery units to the area so that even if they lose a trench to a Ukrainian assault, they can quickly shower their lost fortifications with shells, forcing Kyiv\u2019s troops to retreat from newly recaptured ground.</p>\n\n<p>Outside the eastern town of Siversk, a team of Ukrainian troops manning a U.S.-supplied 105 mm howitzer listened to its \u201cneighbor,\u201d a self-propelled howitzer, fire several rounds. Then the 105 mm\u2019s team received its own fire mission, via smartphone and Starlink internet, targeting a Russian mortar team.</p>\n\n<p>The crew peeled back its camouflage netting, fired twice, and then concealed again.</p>\n\n<p>The fire mission was successful. But for many Ukrainian artillery units, it is not that simple.</p>\n\n<p>Ukrainian artillery crews are navigating an assortment of munitions delivered from countries like Pakistan, Poland, Bulgaria and Iran, forcing gun crews to adjust their aim based on which country the ammunition comes from and sometimes how old it is, even though it is all the same caliber.</p>\n\n<p>Frequent artillery fire almost always brings retaliation. Twenty minutes after a Ukrainian 105 mm fired a salvo, the Russians fired back, showering the area with cluster munitions, a class of shells and rockets that explode and distribute smaller explosives over a wide area. Both Russia and Ukraine have used the weapons, though many countries ban them.</p>\n\n<p>The Russians used cluster munitions, the gun crew said, because they did not know exactly where the Ukrainians were, so they opted instead to blanket the area with the small exploding bombs with the hopes of hitting their target somewhere among the trees.</p>\n\n<p>One of the defining features of summer combat in eastern Ukraine is the foliage. Covering a tank or artillery piece with camouflage is called \u201cmasking\u201d by the Ukrainians, and the routine is critical to avoid detection from drones and the artillery fire that is sure to follow. Around Bakhmut, the fields and tree lines are known among Ukrainian troops as the \u201cgreen zone.\u201d</p>\n</div>",

Ukraine reports around 4100 Russian tank losses, versus 2156 from Oryx, whose numbers are generally regarded as necessarily an undercount because they rely on photographic evidence largely submitted by civilians with Ukrainian sympathies. Losses that occur in areas that the Ukrainians have not yet reclaimed are less likely to be documented, because fewer Ukraine-friendly civilians have access to those areas to take pictures. Similarly, vehicles lost in the middle of minefields are less likely to be documented by civilians and thus usually only show up on Oryx if one side or the other releases drone footage that happens to show the vehicle. Vehicles that are disabled and recovered before photographic evidence is taken are not counted, even if the vehicle ends up being a complete loss. Vehicles that are destroyed or disabled in locations that are difficult to spot also may go uncounted, e.g., if a tank was disabled in a treeline in eastern Ukraine a year ago, it may be overgrown by now, even if that territory has since been retaken. And I'm sure there are many other scenarios where losses don't show up on Oryx.\n\nIt's hard to put a number on the scale of the undercount. Even ignoring it, though, the Ukrainians are at worst over reporting the \"true\" tank losses by 90% or so. Which is not as if they are multiplying the real figures by an arbitrary positive number as they go. If Oryx is missing a mere third of the true losses (i.e. they are counting 2/3rds of actual losses so \"true\" losses would be 3234), though, the Ukrainian over count would be only 27% ((4100-3234)/3234). Which given the uncertainties of war seems within the realm of reasonable error rather than an indication of intentional propaganda.

These kind of people are important even in small quantities, you cannot  replace one hundred PhD with one million workers, and you cannot train them overnight \n Before all if this mess they could probably live and work for two or more countries, bringing some expertise and resources back. Now it is strictly one way street, professionals don&#39;t feel safe in Russia anymore. And about science - I work in science, and worked in Russia. Russian science is, by all accounts, is clinically dead, and I suspect it has entered biological death so it is irreversible. In few decades the world will be living with factory grown ai controlled swarm drones, used for all kind of things, from construction to rescue, and Russia (or whatever states will be present on its territory) will be on the same technological level as today, being an object, not a subject of new technological advances.</p>\n</div>",

I can't comprehend how people don't see it as that. \n\nCountries don't go to war to annex a piece of another country (and get away with it). This stuff is not supposed to happen in post-WW2 international order.

That believe that Russia is somehow going to relegate itself into a minor power status or something. Without even considering that maybe the rest of the world sees the West incapable of producing 1 million artillery shells and thinking \"holy shit, we just need to kick in the door\". \n\nOf course the West would eventually gear itself up in any such scenario, but I have strong inklings that it would happen considerably later than my country is overrun. Here in my country we don't see Russia being significantly weakened militarily from all of this. National intelligence says that it takes 3-4 years for Russia to restore pre-war capabilities.
