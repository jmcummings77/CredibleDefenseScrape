Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.'

Defense contractor [Anduril](https://www.anduril.com/) has announced a new infrared sensor system that can be used as an airborne infrared search and track system, or IRST, to help crewed and uncrewed aircraft spot and engage aerial threats including stealthy ones.\n\n[Low-Cost Infrared Search And Track System For Aircraft Unveiled By Anduril | The Warzone | February 2024](https://www.twz.com/air/low-cost-infrared-search-and-track-system-for-aircraft-unveiled-by-anduril)\n\n*Though Anduril is making this formal announcement now, the [Iris family](https://www.anduril.com/hardware/iris) has already been in development for some time. The company told The War Zone that the sensors' capabilities had already been demonstrated in multiple contexts \"through integrations and live-flight tests\" on a variety of aircraft, including tactical combat jet types. Pictures at the top of this story and below shows an Iris sensor integrated on top of the nose of a tactical jet, though Anduril declined to disclose what type or the operator. Anduril has stressed that the exact look of the sensor and the available housing options is already evolving significantly from the test configuration seen here.* \n\n*\"Iris leverages Anduril\u2019s proprietary and proven Computational Pixel Imager (CPI) technology that uses processors in every pixel to reduce noise and enable accurate detections at more extreme ranges than previously thought possible,\" according to a press release from Anduril. \"That capability is facilitated by real-time AI [artificial intelligence] detection and classification that autonomously identifies and tracks hundreds of objects of interest to help operators see potential targets through the noise.\"*\n\n*Iris takes further advantage of Anduril's previous work on its Wide-Area Infrared System for Persistent Surveillance sensor system, or WISP, which also uses the CPI technology. WISP is currently offered primarily for ground-based and shipboard applications, including as part of counter-drone systems.*\n\n*[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJRwIdRpi3g) Anduril video gives a look into the imaging sensor work the company has already done, including with regard to WISP.*\n\n*\"Inherently modular and flexible, Iris offers several configurations across lens type, wavelength, and pixel image format to bring best-in-class imaging performance to any mission set,\" the company's press release adds. \"Iris is adaptable to most aircraft, including Autonomous Air Vehicles (AAVs) and uncrewed platforms, to enable autonomous, artificial intelligence-powered image processing at the edge to detect and track hundreds of targets at long range.\"*\n\n*Anduril told us that Iris is available in a largely self-contained package with its own housing for the sensor that can be adapted as required to fit different aircraft mounting requirements, as well as a \"processing box\" with requisite hardware and software. \"In some cases\" Iris \"can be integrated with existing mission systems,\" according to the company.*\n\n*Altogether, Iris, coupled with CPI technology and the AI-driven processing backend Anduril is offering, seems well suited specifically for use as an IRST system. This is a type of capability that has been seeing a real renaissance in the West, including in the U.S. military, in recent years. The U.S. Navy is acquiring a larger and costlier podded IRST system that utilized a modified drop tank for use on its F/A-18E/F Super Hornets. A similar podded IRST system, called the Legion Pod, has been seen more and more use in the U.S. Air Force, too.*\n\n*What IRST systems 'see' of an aerial target is not impacted by any of that target's features designed to reduce its radar cross section. In other words, stealthy shaping and radar absorbent materials have no impact on an IRST's detection capabilities. However, work done to mitigate an aircraft's infrared signature would have an effect.*\n\n*IRSTs are similarly immune to radio frequency electronic warfare jamming. They also scan passively, reducing the likelihood a target will even know it has been spotted. All of this offers advantages over typical radars, especially in environments where large numbers of stealthy aircraft or cruise missiles or heavy electronic warfare use is expected.*\n\n*In addition, IRSTs can be used to complement radars, offering a passive way to detect targets, which radars can then be cued to further investigate and vice-versa. The overall fusion of sensor information can offer higher fidelity tracks of multiple targets simultaneously and just better situational awareness even in complex future battlespaces.*\n\n*It is worth noting that a single IRST typically can only instantaneously determine bearing to a target by itself, with it being harder to take the information the sensor gathers and figure out the distance to that target. This can be mitigated by networking multiple IRST-equipped platforms together and determining the range via triangulation.*\n\n*In addition, from what we have seen of Iris so far, each individual sensor is more of a 'staring' type with a fixed field of view. Many existing IRSTs use a more cumbersome sensor in some kind of gimbaled or similarly articulating mount to allow it to scan a larger area, often telescopically. As note, of course, Iris is intended to be readily adaptable to different mounting arrangements and it is certainly possible that these sensors could be fitted in a gimbal or something similar depending on customer requirements. Iris also looks to benefit from a relatively compact core that would for more flexibility in integration options overall.*\n\n*At the same time, a 'staring' system could still provide useful functionality as an IRST. An array of these sensors could be positioned elsewhere around a single aircraft to provide more coverage, as well. This would be very broadly akin to the Distributed Aperture System (DAS) found on F-35 fighters. A podded system could also be devised with multiple fixed sensors facing in different directions.*\n\n*A Iris configuration involving multiple individual sensors on a single platform could have functionality as a threat warning system or just to provide additional situational awareness, or even some degree of air-to-ground target detection/targeting capabilities.*\n\n*Iris's compact design, whether integrated directly onto a platform or via a pod, could offer other advantages, such a less need to consume physical space inside and airframe. This could make the system easier to add onto smaller platforms and just more flexible in general.*\n\n*\"We designed Iris primarily for new uncrewed and autonomous systems,\" Anduril told The War Zone. \"As those systems become more widespread, they will need affordable passive sensing solutions that enable long-range detection and discrimination of hundreds of targets simultaneously across all domains, while maintaining high availability and producibility at scale.\"*",

I think people overrate and project Zelensky wanting to hold onto power. He has said multiple times he wants to retreat into private life after the war, and I personally feel its genuine.\n\nMy personal take is there was simply a clash of military styles, Zaluzhny is an excellent peacetime and defensive general everyone loves, and is a believer in capabilities/technology. Syrskyi I believe is underrated- he gets too much flak for being the commander of the Ground Forces, the hardest role. I don't think Zelenskyy cares to hold on to power but thinks for the duration of the war volatile politics will be deadly for Ukraine, and he is promoting many types like Syrskyi, tactical generals not known for charisma but underrated for skill and taking the hard tasks. E.g. people blame his failed defence of Bakhmut that cost many lives but forget Russia incurred 100,000+ casualties there. The sad part of war is sometimes you need a \"butcher\".\n\nIt wouldnt surprise me Zaluzhnyy acquiesced after discussions made it clear the coming year has many very difficult decisions that have to be made and he can retire now in glory and avoid taking any potential fall. Z offered him to stay on the team probably with logistics or communicating with Western allies. Syrskyi gets a reputation for a butcher, and morale will indeed be a huge issue, but I think Z and top leadership saw they need a war bureacracy on par with Russia's at this stage of the war. Its not insurgency level anymore and unpopular decisions need to be made with people willing to take the fall for bad consequences. In that sense I'm in the minority but I have faith in Syrskyi yet",

I don&#39;t think Zelenskyy cares to hold on to power but thinks for the duration of the war volatile politics will be deadly for Ukraine, and he is promoting many types like Syrskyi, tactical generals not known for charisma but underrated for skill and taking the hard tasks. E.g. people blame his failed defence of Bakhmut that cost many lives but forget Russia incurred 100,000+ casualties there. The sad part of war is sometimes you need a &quot;butcher&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>It wouldnt surprise me Zaluzhnyy acquiesced after discussions made it clear the coming year has many very difficult decisions that have to be made and he can retire now in glory and avoid taking any potential fall. Z offered him to stay on the team probably with logistics or communicating with Western allies. Syrskyi gets a reputation for a butcher, and morale will indeed be a huge issue, but I think Z and top leadership saw they need a war bureacracy on par with Russia&#39;s at this stage of the war. Its not insurgency level anymore and unpopular decisions need to be made with people willing to take the fall for bad consequences. In that sense I&#39;m in the minority but I have faith in Syrskyi yet</p>\n</div>",

The status quo is untenable. . . . Decades of investment\u2014including funding, knowledge transfer, and other intangible benefits\u2014from U.S. VCs have helped build and strengthen the PRC\u2019s priority sectors.\u201d\n> \n> **\ufeffIn certain cases, the lawmakers even uncovered internal VC memorandums stating that Chinese investments were more attractive if the company supported the Chinese government's surveillance state or its strategy for technological supremacy, designed to weaken the United States. The lawmakers also lay out how, beyond dollars, these investments provide credibility and know-how to problematic PRC companies.**\n> \n> \ufeffAfter uncovering the billions of dollars and intangible benefits VC firms have provided these companies tied to the CCP\u2019s military and human rights abuses, Chairman Gallagher and Ranking Member Krishnamoorthi recommend the United States immediately:\n> \n> * Restrict U.S. investment in entities sanctioned or red-flagged by the U.S. Government for ties to the PLA, or forced labor and genocide.\n> * Implement additional sectoral outbound investment restrictions in areas related to the PRC\u2019s critical and emerging technologies, military capabilities, and human rights abuses, building upon those recently established through executive action for PRC AI, semiconductor, and quantum computing companies. \n> \n> Read Chairman Gallagher and Ranking Member Krishnamoorthi\u2019s report: \"The CCP's Investors- How American Venture Capital Fuels the PRC Military and Human Rights Abuses\" HERE.",

The report also highlights other investments that may raise significant security or human rights concerns.</p>\n\n<p>In the report, the lawmakers write, \u201cThe Committee\u2019s findings suggest that there are billions of dollars beyond those captured in this report that have flowed into PRC companies that support the PRC\u2019s military, digital authoritarianism, and efforts to develop technological supremacy and undermine American technological leadership. The status quo is untenable. . . . Decades of investment\u2014including funding, knowledge transfer, and other intangible benefits\u2014from U.S. VCs have helped build and strengthen the PRC\u2019s priority sectors.\u201d</p>\n\n<p><strong>\ufeffIn certain cases, the lawmakers even uncovered internal VC memorandums stating that Chinese investments were more attractive if the company supported the Chinese government&#39;s surveillance state or its strategy for technological supremacy, designed to weaken the United States. The lawmakers also lay out how, beyond dollars, these investments provide credibility and know-how to problematic PRC companies.</strong></p>\n\n<p>\ufeffAfter uncovering the billions of dollars and intangible benefits VC firms have provided these companies tied to the CCP\u2019s military and human rights abuses, Chairman Gallagher and Ranking Member Krishnamoorthi recommend the United States immediately:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Restrict U.S. investment in entities sanctioned or red-flagged by the U.S. Government for ties to the PLA, or forced labor and genocide.</li>\n<li>Implement additional sectoral outbound investment restrictions in areas related to the PRC\u2019s critical and emerging technologies, military capabilities, and human rights abuses, building upon those recently established through executive action for PRC AI, semiconductor, and quantum computing companies. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Read Chairman Gallagher and Ranking Member Krishnamoorthi\u2019s report: &quot;The CCP&#39;s Investors- How American Venture Capital Fuels the PRC Military and Human Rights Abuses&quot; HERE.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",
