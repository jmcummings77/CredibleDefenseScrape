Bean-counters are understandably scrutinizing many multi-million dollar deals with private companies that will affect the data their analysts have access to for years.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://federalnewsnetwork.com/inside-ic/2024/05/states-osint-strategy-aims-to-serve-diplomats-demand-for-unclassified-assessments/?readmore=1\">https://federalnewsnetwork.com/inside-ic/2024/05/states-osint-strategy-aims-to-serve-diplomats-demand-for-unclassified-assessments/?readmore=1</a></p>\n</div>",

We know that AIM-120 can use the launching aircraft (or datalink from other aircraft in the case of the AIM-120D) to guide the missile to the target. The idea is that the target aircraft won't know there is a lock as I believe the AMRAAM uses a soft-lock during the initial phase. After the missile goes pitbull, then the target gets a radar lock warning.  \nWhat if instead, the missile uses IR after it goes pitbull? This will for sure delay the time it takes to go pitbull as the IR range is shorter, but the target aircraft will never get a warning, as everything is passive. Or will a IR seeker and the cooling components just make the missile too heavy? Has this ever been mentioned or discussed by official sources?\n\nAlso what would be the brevity code of such missile?

Does that imply that the US would have stopped to contribute to the defense of democracies globally?\n\nMore importantly, is there someone that would take that status away from them?\n\n> The US defence establishment & policies would pretty much be ridiculed heavily both in Europe & Domestically. \n\nAfter the Congress shenanigans, I thought that was already the case. Well, maybe not domestically, but in Europe it certainly is. \n\nHowever, the general sentiment in NATO partners must be closer to anger, or perhaps shock at the realization that the US isn't a reliable partner when the President doesn't have that much power in the face of its internal politics. And yet, here we are: no one serious is talking about NATO breaking up. \n\nThe belief that article 5 is ironclad remains unshaken.\n\n> A Russian victory now or later on will ensure a Trump or Trump-like isolationist victory in at least 2028 if not before that. A European Defence Alliance would pretty much replace NATO & European countries full focus will be on detering & defeating Russia in the 2030s \n\nThe notion that an Ukrainian defeat would push the US to leave NATO is nonsense. It doesn't invalidate the purpose of the alliance in any shape or form. It's purely reputational damage and countries don't take major steps like that just because the other side made jokes to said mean words to them...\n\nOf course that doesn't mean it's impossible to happen, a Trump victory in ~6 months could be the all the catalyst needed for the US to leave NATO. But that could happen with or without Russian victory in Ukraine.\n\nI'm focusing on the US leaving NATO because that's your entire point: you made it clear that all European countries still intend on maintaining an alliance - presumably identical in nature to NATO - in order to defend themselves against Russia. \n\nI'll note however, that you assumed that the US leaving NATO automatically means its dissolution. That's not a reasonable assumption because the purpose of the alliance would remain the same, countries leave organizations when they don't see the point of staying it or keeping the organization alive anymore and we both agree that Europe need that alliance. I also don't see a legitimacy problem just because a member decided to leave on its own accord.\n\nMaybe there would be rebranding and an update to the charter sure, but I don't think Europe would simply throw 75 years of relations into the dumpster just because the US left. What do they have to gain from starting all over under a different name exactly? I can tell you what they would lose: members, starting with Canada, Slovakia and Hungary (unless their politics change a lot), probably Turkey and other European countries that are either butthurt about it, became isolationist or don't see Russia as threatening them personally.\n\n> On to Taiwan now. If America let's Ukraine fall good luck on getting any European Country to support the US against China militarily over Taiwan when they got a more pressing issue of Russia next door.     Expect a massive Anti-War movement in the US as the American public would not accept the US fighting China alone.\n\nWhat does that have to do with NATO breaking up?

                            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>If US allows Russia to win the war in Ukraine it will lose it&#39;s status as a major contributor to defense of democracies globally. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How so? Does that imply that the US would have stopped to contribute to the defense of democracies globally?</p>\n\n<p>More importantly, is there someone that would take that status away from them?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The US defence establishment &amp; policies would pretty much be ridiculed heavily both in Europe &amp; Domestically. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>After the Congress shenanigans, I thought that was already the case. Well, maybe not domestically, but in Europe it certainly is. </p>\n\n<p>However, the general sentiment in NATO partners must be closer to anger, or perhaps shock at the realization that the US isn&#39;t a reliable partner when the President doesn&#39;t have that much power in the face of its internal politics. And yet, here we are: no one serious is talking about NATO breaking up. </p>\n\n<p>The belief that article 5 is ironclad remains unshaken.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>A Russian victory now or later on will ensure a Trump or Trump-like isolationist victory in at least 2028 if not before that. A European Defence Alliance would pretty much replace NATO &amp; European countries full focus will be on detering &amp; defeating Russia in the 2030s </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The notion that an Ukrainian defeat would push the US to leave NATO is nonsense. It doesn&#39;t invalidate the purpose of the alliance in any shape or form. It&#39;s purely reputational damage and countries don&#39;t take major steps like that just because the other side made jokes to said mean words to them...</p>\n\n<p>Of course that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s impossible to happen, a Trump victory in ~6 months could be the all the catalyst needed for the US to leave NATO. But that could happen with or without Russian victory in Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m focusing on the US leaving NATO because that&#39;s your entire point: you made it clear that all European countries still intend on maintaining an alliance - presumably identical in nature to NATO - in order to defend themselves against Russia. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll note however, that you assumed that the US leaving NATO automatically means its dissolution. That&#39;s not a reasonable assumption because the purpose of the alliance would remain the same, countries leave organizations when they don&#39;t see the point of staying it or keeping the organization alive anymore and we both agree that Europe need that alliance. I also don&#39;t see a legitimacy problem just because a member decided to leave on its own accord.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe there would be rebranding and an update to the charter sure, but I don&#39;t think Europe would simply throw 75 years of relations into the dumpster just because the US left. What do they have to gain from starting all over under a different name exactly? I can tell you what they would lose: members, starting with Canada, Slovakia and Hungary (unless their politics change a lot), probably Turkey and other European countries that are either butthurt about it, became isolationist or don&#39;t see Russia as threatening them personally.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>On to Taiwan now. If America let&#39;s Ukraine fall good luck on getting any European Country to support the US against China militarily over Taiwan when they got a more pressing issue of Russia next door.     Expect a massive Anti-War movement in the US as the American public would not accept the US fighting China alone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What does that have to do with NATO breaking up?

Also, China is stepping into the vacuum created by Western company departures, and even if it&#39;s not 1:1 swap, it could be good enough to allow Russia to produce enough to keep the war effort alive indefinitely.</p>\n\n<p>Even if Russia really were that inept at production, countries like Iran and N Korea are already giving Russia arms, and China could follow suit or at least turn a blind(er) eye to smuggling.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s yet another article about how sanctions and oil price &quot;caps&quot; aren&#39;t hobbling Russia as much as once hoped: <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/how-america-inadvertently-created-an-axis-of-evasion-led-by-china-0a9bc477\">https://www.wsj.com/world/how-america-inadvertently-created-an-axis-of-evasion-led-by-china-0a9bc477</a></p>\n\n<p>Lastly, so long as Putin is alive and well, he seems unlikely to be toppled no matter how unpopular the war among ordinary Russians.   Even if he somehow died or something, there is no guarantee his successor would be any less belligerent, and s/he might even be MORE belligerent.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, from what I&#39;ve read, Russia has the human, economic, natural, military, and political resources to fight basically indefinitely.</p>\n\n<p>So how is &quot;time on Ukraine&#39;s side&quot; given these circumstances?</p>\n</div>",

If Russia buckles up for defense, it will need much fewer resources. Defender&#39;s advantage. (This isn&#39;t even going into the vast numbers of mines Russia has used, and can use.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My guess is you have trouble doing this, because you either state russias/putins stated objectives, which are nebulous and at the same time, by their accounts not even remotely archieved (denazification, demilitarization, remove kiev regime bla bla bla). Which means <strong>you</strong> would now have to explain, why they are so miserably behind pace and how they could possibly reach it.</p>\n\n<p>Or the other option (which you shifted into with the quote), is something like &quot;Russia is somewhat happy with the current lines and only needs to play defense&quot;.
