Not anxiety yet, but sadness and disappointment.\n>* Very pronounced misunderstanding, why Ukraine does not surrender, why there is no internal debate about the need to surrender, they are doomed. As it seems to him, the further this all drags on, the more there will be wasted casualties on both sides, and the more expensive will be the \"price\" of a future Russian victory, which he still believes in, and this upsets him greatly.\n>* The same misunderstanding applies to the West: is the desire to crush Russia so strong that they will fight to the last Ukrainian? Disappointment and pain that everything is not going the way it would seem logical to him: there is no increase in disagreements between Western countries, no rise of a more conservative and nationally oriented domestic Western opposition, no rebellion of the masses and so on. So it's all kind of there, but too slow.\n>* The war with Ukraine has finally become perceived as a civil war: Putin blatantly blames the Americans for \"first pulling us apart, dividing us, and then pitting us against each other.\" Another very revealing phrase: \"No one wants the unification of the Russian people.\" There is a sense of fatalism, doom, and loneliness. It's been a long time since Putin has shown himself to be like this. Or maybe never.\n>* Nevertheless, he is not ready for any kind of peace. \"Our goal is not to spin this flywheel of military conflict, but, on the contrary, to end this war\" - this phrase should not be taken as a change of position and willingness to negotiate, it is more a manifestation of internal shock at the fact that the West so \"consumes\" \"our\" Ukraine (yes, that is how he sees it), multiplied by emotional rejection and lack of understanding of external hostility - we came to save, historical truth is ours, but the justice will not prevail. He does not blame himself for anything.\n>* An important evolution: if at the beginning of the war it seemed to Putin that now he took everything into his own hands and reshapes the world, now he feels himself again as a victim of circumstances - the war as a result of systematic efforts of the USA, which brought Russia to this \"stage\" of fratricidal war.\n>* There is no regret for your own actions. \"We had no other way out,\" \"we could not retreat\"... All this is said already with sadness, but without any doubt that we have to go on. \"Chicken Little by Little\" is his view of how Russia will behave in the coming months. That is, to slowly crush and strangle Ukraine, avoiding large-scale fighting. One senses a readiness for a protracted confrontation. Although there is a \"bitter\" emotion about the human casualties, but in his perception the existence of Russia is at stake, and therefore there is no stopping.\n>* There is a noticeable sense of guilt towards the military. The fact that he has to throw them into the \"furnace\" of the war clearly causes him moral pain, and much more pronounced than his sense of responsibility to his mothers. But, of course, he puts the main blame on the West - if they had not supported Kiev, everything would have been over by now.\n>* He is clearly \"wound up\" with an emotional attitude towards the patriots. His words about being moved to tears by the patriotism of young people are a clear indication of how his administration has generally learned to strike the right strings. But at the heart of it is an emerging sense of guilt that he got millions into this war and that it went the way it did. This feeling \"asks\" for collective solidarity and constant external support. Otherwise the burden becomes unbearable. Maybe that's why everything \"truly patriotic\" touches him so much - it makes him feel lighter.\n>* Lastly, there is a clear division in Putin's perception of the real patriots, for whom he has a very reverent attitude and reverence, and the non-patriots, whom he sees as a threat. This, of course, lays the foundation for the development of a more developed and ruthless system of distinguishing between \"friend\" and \"foe\", as well as mechanisms of protection against the latter. In general, it comes down to more mass repression and a more developed state ideology.\n\nNot to make some frivolous equivalence to Hitler, but the attitude described here, of gloomy disappointment, unenthusiastic determination, and absolving his mistakes by claiming that the disastrous choices he made were forced by circumstance, is reminiscent to that of Hitler in 1942, as expressed in [the only candid recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oET1WaG5sFk) made of his voice, where he laments the surprising strength of his opponent but remains certain that he could do no other.",

All this is said already with sadness, but without any doubt that we have to go on. &quot;Chicken Little by Little&quot; is his view of how Russia will behave in the coming months. That is, to slowly crush and strangle Ukraine, avoiding large-scale fighting. One senses a readiness for a protracted confrontation. Although there is a &quot;bitter&quot; emotion about the human casualties, but in his perception the existence of Russia is at stake, and therefore there is no stopping.</li>\n<li>There is a noticeable sense of guilt towards the military. The fact that he has to throw them into the &quot;furnace&quot; of the war clearly causes him moral pain, and much more pronounced than his sense of responsibility to his mothers. But, of course, he puts the main blame on the West - if they had not supported Kiev, everything would have been over by now.</li>\n<li>He is clearly &quot;wound up&quot; with an emotional attitude towards the patriots. His words about being moved to tears by the patriotism of young people are a clear indication of how his administration has generally learned to strike the right strings. But at the heart of it is an emerging sense of guilt that he got millions into this war and that it went the way it did. This feeling &quot;asks&quot; for collective solidarity and constant external support. Otherwise the burden becomes unbearable. Maybe that&#39;s why everything &quot;truly patriotic&quot; touches him so much - it makes him feel lighter.</li>\n<li>Lastly, there is a clear division in Putin&#39;s perception of the real patriots, for whom he has a very reverent attitude and reverence, and the non-patriots, whom he sees as a threat. This, of course, lays the foundation for the development of a more developed and ruthless system of distinguishing between &quot;friend&quot; and &quot;foe&quot;, as well as mechanisms of protection against the latter. In general, it comes down to more mass repression and a more developed state ideology.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Not to make some frivolous equivalence to Hitler, but the attitude described here, of gloomy disappointment, unenthusiastic determination, and absolving his mistakes by claiming that the disastrous choices he made were forced by circumstance, is reminiscent to that of Hitler in 1942, as expressed in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oET1WaG5sFk\">the only candid recording</a> made of his voice, where he laments the surprising strength of his opponent but remains certain that he could do no other.</p>\n</div>",

Wagner appears to be his personal army, loyal to him. The siloviki are not a threat to him, if Wagner purges them all.</p>\n\n<p>For a while he appeared to be courting Kadyrov. Kadyrov has the useful property of running another militia personally loyal to himself. Kadyrov is also important because he, as a Chechen, could instigate instability in Russia, if he senses that his deal with Russia, of quiet for money, is in jeopardy. Prigozhin probably needs more allies, perhaps in slightly less senior ranks of the military, and security services. Members of the services who are disgruntled for one reason or another with the handling of the war so far. Has he publicly sweet talked anyone else recently?</p>\n</div>",

As an example even though there is like $100 billion in \"total Ukraine spending\", note that only about **$23 billion** of that money is for **weapons** sent to Ukraine (with **only about $14 billion** of the $23 billion **actually delivered**, the rest is just \"money committed\" with pending future deliveries). There is a Congressional Research Service pdf (it is kept up to date with monthly updates, see here: https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12040 ).\n\nEveryone thinks Ukraine got $100 billion of weapons, **but it didn't**. Less than 25% of that \"Ukraine money\" is weapons spending, with **less than 15%** of the total being weapons **actually delivered**.\n\nUkraine does get direct cash injection (about $25 billion now afaik), but the rest of the money (the remaining 50%) doesn't go to Ukraine, it is government spending that would happen even if the US didn't help Ukraine (these are various related expenditures).\n\n(2) Because of the RU invasion (and the new super-aggressive Putin posture) the US has to deploy additional forces to NATO's eastern border. **This costs money**, for example just the last $45 billion package (part of the $1.7 trillion Omnibus bill) contained $6.98 billion for USEUCOM (part of the military that maintains those troops at the eastern flank). Note that previous bills contained similar billions for troop deployments/operations. This is a **new, ongoing, and yearly expense**, this is an example of spending that is slotted in Ukraine bills but doesn't actually go to Ukraine, it is just war-related spending.\n\nThese new $7-10 billion **yearly mil expenditures** are a result of **Putin's actions**, he (Putin), **not Ukraine**, necessitates the spending. Note that these troop deployments are quite small because Ukraine has not fallen, but still stands. You don't want to imagine how much it is going to cost if Ukraine were to fall and we'd have the Russians right at Poland's border.\n\nThe US has a choice: send money to Ukraine to blunt the Russians, or spend through the nose if Ukraine is overrun.\n\n(3) Weapons aid is domestic spending, and defense jobs make up 10 percent of U.S. Manufacturing. It's American firms with American workers that get the contracts. The weapons that are sent to Ukraine are usually an older stock that is nearing its expiration date, if not sent to Ukraine the weapons would be discarded, mothballed, or would cost money to properly utilize. Remember those old/junk M113s sent to Ukraine? They were billed as $850 million in Ukraine spending, trust me, nobody in the army wants those M113s.\n\n(4) Some weapons manufacturers get a nice boost of orders because of a successful demo in Ukraine. For example, the US sent $700 million worth of HIMARS (launchers + rockets), but Raytheon is slated to reap $6-10 billion in new Foreign Military Sales because everyone now wants to order HIMARS. You might hate the mil industrial complex, but it employs a lot of people (10% of all US manufacturing). Raytheon is mostly owned by US shareholders, its factories are in the US, etc.",

Putin wants the land, if he bests Ukraine in battle he gets it. Tale as old as time</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

This relationship seems to be the one keeping them afloat. The import and other economic indicators seem to be pretty grim for Russia. Oil sales dropped overall and Russian imports (and one assumes non-oil exports tho I didn't see a graph for that?) dropped by almost 40% overnight, and havn't recovered.

By forcing Russian oil prices lower, China and India buy Russian oil over more expensive alternatives. So Russia exports more bbls, sees a lower price, but at least their total revenue remains constant. They dont enjoy the benefits of higher prices, but dont lose out either. If you accept that hypothetical, the real loser from the price cap is Saudi Arabia.

He could be the big hero if he price matched or undercut Russian oil. We know KSA has a lower cost to market than Russia, and its transportation costs are much less as well.
