                            "body": ">The main feture everyone can agree on for 5th gen is stealthiness, and the Felon doesn't have it\n\nMy understanding is that this is a misinterpretation of what was said in the Sukhoi patent, basically. It's founded on the claim that Sukhoi says the RCS is 0.1 to 1m^2 and that a clean F/A-18 has a 1m^2 RCS too...but the patent actually says that the _average_ RCS is in that range. Without knowing the range of frequencies and aspects they're modelling though that doesn't seem like an especially useful comparison either. There's [this pretty cool webpage](https://basicsaboutaerodynamicsandavionics.wordpress.com/2022/09/26/su-57-radar-scattering-simulation/) which tries to model the RCS across a bunch of frequencies and aspects and that concludes:\n\n> Compared to the F-35, then Su-57 RCS is quite a bit higher through X-band to L-band. Especially, in X-band, the median RCS value in the 40\u00b0 frontal sector of Su-57 is 8 times higher than a clean F-35A and 7 times higher than F-35A loaded with AIM-9X. The average RCS of Su-57 in the same condition is 11 times higher than clean F-35A and 9 times higher than F-35A loaded with AIM-9X. \n\nSo much worse than an F-35, but not 1000x worse. The site also models F-16 and Rafale and gives Su-57 a much smaller value than either. I have no idea if this person is using a proper methodology or whatever but I find it more convincing than the claim of crap RCS based on the patent. Any thoughts?",

In the interview, it's pretty clear he spent quite some time reading Russian military litarerature.\n\nThe TLDR of what he says is:\n\nRussia war theory used to be clausewitzian, but it actually evolved beyond that point, seeing hybrid warfare and non kinetic actions as more powerfull tools. Somewhat confirmed by Georgia and Ukraine 2014, the result is that the massive blunders by the Russian military in 2022 not as military planning, but a pure misunderstanding of the situation, based on the belief Ukraine could be taken without a high-intensity conflict. In this sense, the VDV assault on Kiev wasn't so much a military action, but of a larger attempt to take over Ukraine that was already \"ripe for the taking\" without really engaging in high intensity warfare.\n\nObviously the Russian intelligence services did not actually manage to prepare Ukraine for a \"ripe taking\", and the entire thing devolved into a high intensity conflict.\n\nYou all know the history. His take is: Russian leadership really was that delusional and that the SMO would be a 3 day operation, and this to a large part because they overvaluate different forms of hybrid warfare, which have become central to Russian defense doctrine to a degree we haven't, and we also haven't realised. The wording he uses is \"contournement de la lutte arm\u00e9e\", which translate to \"avoiding/flanking/going around the weaponized fight\".\n\n  \nHe also conjures up an interesting idea where Russia and the West are essentialy fighting two different cyber wars: The west sees it as a war over zero day exploits for critical infrastructure. The Russians see a psychological information battleground.\n\nI'll probably end up buying his book, and I recommend watching the video, as my summary is a summary.",

This is in line with what I have calculated based on previous statements about the scale of production prewar and the increase of it afterwards. The price of Finnish shells is about the half way between Russian and Western European production.</p>\n\n<p>He prefers buying new weapons for Ukraine instead of sending old army stock.</p>\n\n<p>Finland could help Ukraine more if the government funded more aid. For example the Defence Force could activate reserve production agreements with companies for production of war materiel for Ukraine. Those agreements were tested in the last year or so and mostly found to be working, but some deficiencies were found as well and not all agreements covered stuff that remained still relevant on this day and age.</p>\n\n<p>He says that Finland doesn&#39;t send just old weapons but even stuff in development for combat testing.</p>\n\n<p>The Finnish army does not have enough storage space for ammunition after the defence cuts around ten years ago. The army is building new storage capacity in country and in Sweden and Norway.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hs.fi/suomi/art-2000010485351.html\">https://www.hs.fi/suomi/art-2000010485351.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Edit: Here is a longer version of the interview. <a href=\"https://www.sss.fi/2024/06/ukrainan-sota-on-toiminut-testikenttana-suomen-puolustusteollisuuden-innovaatioille-kertoo-puolustusvoimien-sotatalouspaallikko-sttlle/\">https://www.sss.fi/2024/06/ukrainan-sota-on-toiminut-testikenttana-suomen-puolustusteollisuuden-innovaatioille-kertoo-puolustusvoimien-sotatalouspaallikko-sttlle/</a></p>\n</div>",

It's default AA missile is the MICA, which from what I get is a medium range infrared homing missile (as in, longer range than stinger, basic BVR capabilities, but way lower range than an AMRAAM and needs good initial energy to get serious ranges).\n\nSo, in their default setup, these would be good only for hunting cruise missiles and shaheds in the rear, although they could get augmented to Storm shadow carriers.

Very limited avenues for entrance/exit, easy to put lethal defenses in place, hard to locate and map out in the first place, etc.\n\nFor that reason, I expect Hamas is holding every living hostage it can in a tunnel. So the number of hostages above ground is probably relatively low, and they are only there due to lack of available/appropriate tunnels.\n\nFor that reason, it's highly impressive how many hostages Israel has managed to locate and rescue (or in one case fail in attempting to rescue) above ground. It must be a rather high percentage of the total above ground.\n\nThat makes me think that Israel has very good intelligence on the hostages and their locations.

Both civil wars were never formally concluded, yet all countries involved consider themselves sovereign. The only difference is that in China's case, they are an economic behemoth that used it's influence to diplomatically isolate Taiwan. \n\nHowever, the UN never ruled on Taiwan's sovereign status, they only voted to have one or the other in the UN council due to the PRC's insistence, and also the US focusing on rapprochement because of China acting as a counter balance to the USSR. There was never a ruling made that Taiwan belongs to the PRC, only that only one of them could be on the UN, at the behest of the PRC. Therefore in the most important legal sense, Taiwan's de jure sovereign status remains internationally unresolved, and there the PRC had no legal right or claim over the island. \n\nThis status quo does not naturally resolve because China has become more powerful since it's induction into the UN, and it's influence is immense over trade. Individual countries who would have no problem legally recognizing Taiwan do not because they will be economically barred from interacting with China ever again. Other countries, like the US, refrain from recognition because it is a likely red line for Chinese invasion.\n\n\nAnother popular PRC talking point is that the civil war was never properly ended, and therefore the PRC has the right to finish it. This is not an internationally recognized legal reason for new military action, especially 50 years after the last major military action has taken place.\n\nThey will also point to ROC (Republic of China, which is Taiwan's original and legal name) land claims and post civil war RoC war rhetoric and claim that they still claim to be the true China as well. While this was partially true in the past, the reality on the ground in Taiwan is that no one in the citizenry or government has any allusions to even joining China, much less invading it. \n\nThe old wordage in the legislature is from an earlier time 50+ years ago when the original RoC dictator Chiang Kai Shek had also wanted to finish the civil war. But by the 80s and 90s, the RoC began to transform into the liberal democracy known internationally and locally as Taiwan today. The old war rhetoric and land claims in the constitution cannot be removed despite having zero relevance today because their removal is also a red line for the PRC to invade. They cannot declare independence for the same reason. They cannot even legally change their name to Taiwan internally because of fears it could provoke the PRC.\n\nSo in total, legally Taiwan doesn't belong to anyone, but it should be up to the Taiwanese to decide. They have been placed in a legal purgatory by Greater forces such as the PRC and the US, and now they simply want to exercise self-determination and exist peacefully.",
