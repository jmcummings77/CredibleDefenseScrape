      "selftext": "The r/CredibleDefense daily megathread is for asking questions and posting submissions that would not fit the criteria of our post submissions. As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster. Don't abuse it though! If something is not obviously against the rules but you still feel that it should be reviewed, leave a short but descriptive comment while filing the report.",

My short assessment: Ukraine now has a somewhat relevant riverine navy, with both boats with serious armaments (30mm cannon, 40 and 30mm grenade launchers, atgms), and simply a high quantity of small fast boats, able to move a decent amount of personnel (but limited - if any - vehicles). Advantages: The boats are a lot faster and more efficient on the river than any land based vehicles trying to defend against them. By dispersing, concentrating, and moving their riverine forces, Ukraine forces Russia to invest heavily in defences along the entire river - yet Ukraine could still possibly achieve local overmatch by rapid concentration and support from HIMARS and artillery. On the downside, the boats can essentialy only operate on that one river, and even the bigger ones should be outmached by tanks with proper FCS, ATGMs also pose a major threat - the river doesn't offer much places to hide. Furthermore, without the ability to transfer heavy equipment, Ukranians are essentialy limited to raids, and it would be very audacious for them to attempt to setup a bridgehead on the other side.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1) Many of these boats are foreign supplied. How do you assess their value compared to other equipment being sent? Is it a valuable investment?\n\n2) The Dniper is only so wide - the entire river should be in range of tanks/atgms or even heavy MGs on the edge. How come these boats are able to operate at all? The video even mentions the smaller ones aren't protected against 7.62\n\n3) In the same vein: Where do they hide at night / stop to refuel? I can imagine there a safe \"side-arms\" (tributaries) that they can use to refuel, but then the Russians could simply \"lock\" them in that tributary by placing an atgm at the exit?\n\n4) \"Boat with 4 atgms (I imagine TOW/STUGNA) and 30mm canon vs T72B3\" is not a fight I can intuitively grasp. Who would have an edge? How would the range affect the engagement, and what would be the other major factors?",

For some stuff, it\u2019s interesting but not necessarily useful or additive to what Russia already should have known. For instance, month old intel on very active areas like Avdiivka, Bakhmut, Vuhledar and the Svatove-Kreminna front is probably not worth much or anything in terms of tactical decision making today. Locating information seemed to be fairly non-specific and insufficient for targeting in the case of anything one might expect to have remained static, and besides, Ukraine has proven to be adept at dispersal and general strike avoidance (otherwise they would not have maintained their AD at the invasion\u2019s outset) so a month on post-leak, if Russia has not already capitalized on this and taken out targets, they are not likely to at all. In terms of offensive planning, once again, plans change - I doubt the evolution of the plan has been static since a month plus ago; furthermore, this is an area where this leak does not appear to be all that knowledgeable. One can glean what the offensive might look like in terms of prescribed equipment but that wasn\u2019t really a secret. Western deliveries made that plenty clear as did general expectations for what a combined arms offensive would necessarily entail by its nature. The where and when is still very much up in the air beyond \u201cprobably later in the spring or early summer\u201d and \u201cUkraine really wants to break the land bridge\u201d and that was already pretty much the consensus anyway when considering the strategic picture and adoption timelines of western equipment. The foreign intel aspect is broadly a confirmation of what one would expect - the US is trying to enlist further western support through nations like SK, and those nations are going through the expected tough deliberations. \n\nThe biggest piece of info appears to be the SAM angle, but at the same time, Russia was in the process of figuring out this by way of terror strikes. They are essentially reconnaissance in force against the AD network and response rates are indicative of Ukraine\u2019s supply urgency. This was going to be uncovered leak or not. Whether the revelation advances that discovery timeline enough to change Russia\u2019s approach much from its original plan is unclear, as they have already been pursuing this AD attrition policy for a while, indicating they were no stranger to this crunch. There is the silver lining that this will likely increase western urgency to find stopgap measures for the Ukrainians, whereas without the leak this dire situation could have unfolded in silence. More patriots are really the only solution I can think of given the unavailability of S300 ammo and that\u2019s the only system I can see taking on any sort of comparable wide-area protective role. But it will require taking on additional risk for NATO as there\u2019s only so many swaps and spare donations one can do. If Ukraine is to survive the SAM crunch, AD and SAM ammo stocks elsewhere will have to take a hit beyond what was previously deemed acceptable. Contracts for new ammo production and systems procurement should be in place yesterday. One simply will have to brave the temporary drop in air security while those production lines awake.\n\nIn short, I think the value in this leak for Russia lies not in new revelations, but in its confirmations of things broadly suspected, allowing Russia to potentially move forward some decisions it otherwise would have needed to wait on. The amount of time is unclear. Perhaps it pushes forward a renewed push for air superiority by as much as a month or more. Perhaps only a couple weeks, or not at all if constraints internal to Russia are at play. Perhaps it informs some shifting of personnel along the front if Russia thinks they have intel that marginally reduces the need to hedge their bets (though any adjustments by Ukraine would make this moot). Also, Russia still needs to prove it can capably exploit any of this. Knowing is only half the battle, of course. It is unclear if this is truly an actionable leak based on all of these factors.",

That\u2019s probably actually the bigger deals, but is strategic rather than operational. The Turkey report in particular may have interesting consequences for NATO. \n\nAnd then there is the AD stuff. Seeing the numbers spelled out is concerning, but is anyone surprised? Did we think that the S-300s would last forever, given the drone and missile onslaught Ukraine has faced? The fact that NATO has pulled HAWK batteries out of storage for Ukraine should have been the signal that ammo reserves were not doing well. But also how many posts have we seen in these threads talking about the cost disparity between a missile and a drone? Every S-300 or BUK shot at a Shahed was always meant to be a bad trade, that\u2019s the point. They didn\u2019t do a lot of damage, but absorbed a bunch of irreplaceable missiles. These docs suggest that the drone and missile strikes were more calculated than this sub (myself included) gave Russia credit for at the time. \n\nThe above is some nice confirmation for Russia of things they already should have known. ORBAT and unit intel are important components of HHQs, and for a reason. Russia likewise ought to have put 2&2 together Re missile counts. Assuming that it wasn\u2019t Russia who leaked these documents in the first place, which has been an IMO under discussed angle, this should be nice to know, but not new. \n\nAnd I personally am not as doom and gloom RE the AD missile situation as others are. Best assume that Ukraine is now critically short of *all* ex-Soviet ammo types. Probably 5.56 and 7.62 are the only categories where they *dont* have an ammo shortage. The question now is if Washington can get ammo up to the front from another ring swap, or send over its own platforms transferred from other at need fronts. A combination of both most likely.

Apply the golden rule here, would you rather be shot (zero chance of any further help) or be given a chance at survival? I'd always pick the latter in most scenarios (how likely are you to ever be captured in a place that's truly so remote no other human could aid you?).\n\nThat said the biggest problem with special forces in general seems to be a lack of oversight. Every single extreme case should probably be seriously reviewed, even if ultimately we decide that even a terrible act was justified by the context, instead of default allowed.

Apply the golden rule here, would you rather be shot (zero chance of any further help) or be given a chance at survival? I&#39;d always pick the latter in most scenarios (how likely are you to ever be captured in a place that&#39;s truly so remote no other human could aid you?).</p>\n\n<p>That said the biggest problem with special forces in general seems to be a lack of oversight.

            "body": "No.\n\nThe wars in Iraq and Afghanistan reversed the Clinton/Bush admin's push for a post-Cold War peace dividend. The problem was that, outside the Navy, no service really had a reason to exist without the USSR. And the Army in particular had a HUGE Desert Storm problem. They were telling Congress the strategic concept for them would be two regional contingencies at the same time: Iraq and Korea. Congress was smart enough (they had at least one functioning brain cell) to realize that it was unlikely there would be an Iraq 2 at the same time as a Korea 2. Moreover Iraq 1 had been such a stunning triumph that really there was a lot of push to cut R&D, new acquisitions, and push existing platforms into the ARNG. \n\nIraq and Afghanistan reversed this, all the sudden the services were flush with money to meet need.

The problem was that, outside the Navy, no service really had a reason to exist without the USSR. And the Army in particular had a HUGE Desert Storm problem. They were telling Congress the strategic concept for them would be two regional contingencies at the same time: Iraq and Korea. Congress was smart enough (they had at least one functioning brain cell) to realize that it was unlikely there would be an Iraq 2 at the same time as a Korea 2.

It's clear that the US cared enough to gain access to encrypted Israeli leadership conversations, as it likely does or tries to do with most allies. \n\nWhile Bergman is the expert and says the Mossad has never domestically intervened within Israel, *Rise and Kill First* includes multiple examples of IDF lower-level leaders deliberately sabotaging aims of Ariel Sharon internally deemed too reckless and potentially threats to Israel itself. I'm thinking mainly of pilots deliberately not shooting down a plane Mossad agents IDed as carrying Yasser Arafat and Sharon ordered shot down; in truth, the plane carried his pediatrician brother Fathi and 30 wounded Palestinian children on their way to medical treatment in Egypt, so the ordered shootdown would have been a PR disaster. I believe there was at least one other instance of internal deliberate stonewalling of Sharon's wishes. It's clear many in the IDF and intel apparatus at large don't support Netanyahu's desired changes. Could this be another branch of the intelligence state doing the same? \n\nAs far as Bergman's objectivity goes, Bergman is probably the foremost journalist on secrets of the Israeli intelligence state working for an American paper, and his previous work has been excellent, so I think he's pretty credible. He's Israeli and most of his stories are based on Israeli sources, but he has reported on a variety of intel that the government may not have wanted public. He can be very critical of state decisions. However, I have noticed occasional things I think have flimsy substantiation, if any (see: he inserts comments about Arafat's possible bisexuality and HIV status at his time of death into *Rise and Kill First* I'm not sure are credible or merited inclusion, although he acknowledges they're persistent speculation/rumors. Admittedly it's possible Arafat did have sex with men and contracted HIV, but given how homophobic the Palestinian public is, this could be someone taking an opportunity to besmirch their longtime leader). \n\nHebrew speakers, is Bergman's tone less confident than it sounds garbled by Google Translate? The English language thread he posted on this is far less assertive in this supposition. Only reason I do think he is likely pretty confident is that other actually Hebrew-reading Twitter users are repeating his conclusion.\n\nAlso possible, though probably unlikely, this part of the leaked documents is a clever forgery by an adversary (probably Russian) intelligence service.\n\nPersonally, I'm agnostic on this. US intelligence services certainly have been known to come to erroneous conclusions at times, as all intel services do and is inevitable given the sheer quantities of info collected and analyzed, but I also think some journalists tend to underestimate CIA successes and competencies based on the overly bumbling impression given by books like *A Legacy of Ashes.* You rarely hear about successful clandestine operations until decades later, while failed ones can be exposed in near-real time. Given the distrust within US intelligence services of Netanyahu in particular and how the Middle East remains geopolitically relevant, regardless of what the American public thinks, I would think there would be decent CIA analysis quality for Israel.",

The US did successfully assassinate Soleimani and had agents on the ground in Iraq able to confirm his death based off a ring he wore, or shoot him themselves if the drone strike failed. How much this operation depended on Israeli intelligence isn't clear. I do think the US generally has significantly inferior penetration of Iran than Israel does, as demonstrated by Mossad agents being the ones who assassinated Abu Muhammad al-Masri in Tehran. The CIA lost most of its Iranian agents a decade ago after a bug in software used to communicate with handlers allowed Iranian counterintel to hunt most of them down. As for MBS's rise, it seems even his own family members didn't anticipate that. MBN certainly didn't. Unless a source was close to MBS in those early years, knew his ambitions, and believed he could achieve his de facto palace coup, it would have been hard to anticipate. \n\n>they didn't seem to anticipate the risk of ISIS to Iraq\n\nDon't think that can be ascertained from the drawdown happening. The White House doesn't always listen to the CIA. I also don't think you needed to be a CIA analyst to see the risk of the drawdown. I remember my dad shouting it from the rooftops to me, \"Power vacuum! Power vacuum!\" Problem was, sticking with the original drawdown dates was very politically popular policy, even if it was stupid.\n\n>I'm skeptical the head of Mossad was giving direct orders to support protests.\n\nAlmost every Israeli writer on Twitter appears to agree with skepticism being warranted here, as do I. To be fair, the wording of the report is that the leadership \"advocated for\" protest from Mossad agents and the Israeli public at large. That seems somewhat softer than a direct order, but it would be incredibly unusual.",

The CIA lost most of its Iranian agents a decade ago after a bug in software used to communicate with handlers allowed Iranian counterintel to hunt most of them down. As for MBS&#39;s rise, it seems even his own family members didn&#39;t anticipate that. MBN certainly didn&#39;t. Unless a source was close to MBS in those early years, knew his ambitions, and believed he could achieve his de facto palace coup, it would have been hard to anticipate. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>they didn&#39;t seem to anticipate the risk of ISIS to Iraq</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t think that can be ascertained from the drawdown happening. The White House doesn&#39;t always listen to the CIA. I also don&#39;t think you needed to be a CIA analyst to see the risk of the drawdown. I remember my dad shouting it from the rooftops to me, &quot;Power vacuum! Power vacuum!&quot; Problem was, sticking with the original drawdown dates was very politically popular policy, even if it was stupid.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I&#39;m skeptical the head of Mossad was giving direct orders to support protests.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Almost every Israeli writer on Twitter appears to agree with skepticism being warranted here, as do I. To be fair, the wording of the report is that the leadership &quot;advocated for&quot; protest from Mossad agents and the Israeli public at large. That seems somewhat softer than a direct order, but it would be incredibly unusual.</p>\n</div>",

This cycle repeats multiple times. \n\nHard to find anyone out there who isn't complaining that Western aid is reactive rather than proactive. Doesn't mean the goal is to perpetuate the conflict, it's far easier to explain it as Western countries being incredibly slow to react. Keep in mind, many *still* haven't placed orders for more artillery ammunition. \n\n>If the US wanted Ukraine to win quickly, they would have send hundreds of Bradleys and Abrams in 2022.\n\nThat would've provoked a significant escalation from Russia. There's a reason why aid has gotten more and more ambitious over time, as the West is salami-slicing or boiling the frog (whichever analogy you prefer) in terms of Russian red lines.

I don't think teleportation arrays are in use by either side yet. \n\nThe 3:1 ratio is the amount of forces to overcome an opposition force. Anything involving \"and then ukraine pushed for months while Russia re positioned\" is obviously a failed offensive. \n\n> Also the amount of men used for the offensive is not likely to surpass 60k just based off public data. So there still isn\u2019t a 3-1 advantage.\n\nAccording to my math skills, 20 goes into 60 three times.\n\n> From what I understand, there isn\u2019t a lot of equipment to destroy.\n\nFirst time I'm hearing about it.

Ships can be sunk in port, planes killed on runways. Hard to start an imperialistic war for ego when all your ships are sunk and your ports clogged with their wreckage.\n\nAll that said, I don't want to derail this discussion, and if you can't envision a pre-emptive strike on a beligerent nation that is just waiting to get into position so it can attack a neighbor, then perhaps you'll understand that poor readiness indicates that a prolonged war would be difficult for China.

This doesn't mean they can't align but that the US doesn't dictate it. Right now Russia is engaged in the first major land war in Europe which has the EU fairly united in it's opposition to the war. This is a land war on European soil which is adversely effecting the EU. If China decides to provide military support and further enable Russia, they will effectively be making the situation in Europe worse, a situation the the EU has to deal with. If they do that, the EU (and the US) will likely impose economic sanctions. This is China's chance to drive a bit of a wedge between the US and the EU on Asian-Pacific policy. Additionally, China's economy needs access to US and EU markets more than it needs Russia to win the war. This is on top of the Chinese not wanting Chinese manufactured equipment getting captured by Ukrainians and transferred to the West for technical analysis and exploitation.\n\nOn the part of NATO and a lose in Ukraine, keep in mind that Putin is trying to return the geopolitical situation to what it was in mid- 2013. NATO was fine then and it was very prepared to accept the loss of Ukraine just prior to the invasion. They wanted to make it painful for Russian forces by providing Javelins and other small arms (to enable a guerrilla war). When everyone realized that the Russians were showing an impressive lack of competence and the Ukrainians demonstrated they were willing to fight for their country, that's when NATO really stepped up the arms transfers and training. The truth is, Putin could go from here to achieve his maximalist goals but the myth of Russian military might is gone, the Russian military is in shambles and will take a decade or more to reconstitute into a meaningful fighting force, the Russian economy is in some serious long term trouble, and NATO has been revitalized and expanded.
