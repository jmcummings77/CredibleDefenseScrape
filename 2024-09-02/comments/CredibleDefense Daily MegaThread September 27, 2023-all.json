      "selftext": "The r/CredibleDefense daily megathread is for asking questions and posting submissions that would not fit the criteria of our post submissions. As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster. Don't abuse it though! If something is not obviously against the rules but you still feel that it should be reviewed, leave a short but descriptive comment while filing the report.",

This is completely false:\n\na) The ECHR established as early as **2015** if not earlier than Armenia has jurisdiction over the NKR:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiragov_and_Others_v._Armenia\n\nb) In that same case (and cases of Armenian refugees vs Azerbaijan) the ECHR noted that **the lack of a peace treaty is completely irrelevant**, and judgements can still be made.\n\nSo the signing or lack of signing of a peace treaty has **no bearing** on whether Azerbaijan can sue Armenia through the ECHR.

This is completely false:</p>\n\n<p>a) The ECHR established as early as <strong>2015</strong> if not earlier than Armenia has jurisdiction over the NKR:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiragov_and_Others_v._Armenia\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiragov_and_Others_v._Armenia</a></p>\n\n<p>b) In that same case (and cases of Armenian refugees vs Azerbaijan) the ECHR noted that <strong>the lack of a peace treaty is completely irrelevant</strong>, and judgements can still be made.</p>\n\n<p>So the signing or lack of signing of a peace treaty has <strong>no bearing</strong> on whether Azerbaijan can sue Armenia through the ECHR.

        "body": "Someone sent me a link to this Le Monde article and asked me if NATO needs to modernize their training. I figured I'd share my thoughts: \n\n[Ukrainian soldiers trained abroad express discontent: 'I repeatedly told them NATO manuals didn't apply'](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2023/09/27/ukrainian-soldiers-trained-abroad-express-discontent-i-repeatedly-told-them-nato-manuals-didn-t-apply_6140349_4.html) \n\n[Archived version](https://archive.ph/WRREJ)\n\nMy answer is, without much more info, no.\n\nFirst, I want to reiterate that I have no idea how the training provided US, UK, Spain, Germany Poland, and Sweden is actually going, what they're actually teaching, etc. \n\nBut as far as I am concerned, it's going to suck because 1) they can't speak the Ukrainian language and need to do it all through interpreters (which I've been bringing up since the war started as a negative, and which the article addresses) 2) it's incredibly 3-5 weeks. Just those two things make it impossible to be good.   \n\nThat said, let's get into it. \n\nThose foreign militaries are teaching BASIC training but these Ukrainians aren't getting anymore and getting sent to the front. It can't be advanced because it's too short, and it needs to reflect unit equipment, TTPs, and extremely specific theater lessons, and those aren't done in basic training. \n\nI can understand that the Ukrainians troops getting the training want it to be not only advanced and but also laser focused on what they're experiencing now. Which isn't even what they were experiencing over the winter. Which is another thing none of the writers of these types of articles understand, nor many OSINT analysts, because none know much about how military training works. \n\nI do. I was an NCO in the US Marines and US Army in the infantry, and training was a major part of my job. Let me explain how this works, regardless of country because there isn't really another way of doing it. \n\nEach NATO country participating is creating a curriculum that's signed off at the highest levels (likely 2-3 star general), probably with some UAF involvement to sign it off. After that, it's carved in stone, inflexible, the instructors do their duty and follow their orders, teach the curriculum, because they're professionals. Unless the same high level officially authorize changes, it doesn't change. \n\nMore so, it's going to be very generalized too, because graduates (who probably can't even be allowed to fail or even recycled, no matter the cause) aren't being prepped to go to units attacking in the South, anymore than those units going to Avdiivka to defend. They're trying to teach basic combat skills because, to paraphrase many NATO military trainer quotes, its better than nothing.\r  \n\r  \nOne paragraph in this article has me peeved also because Watling from RUSI said something similar. \n\nThe complain is that when they run them through assault drills they don't include taking small arms fire, no incoming artillery, no snipers, no mines, etc. \r  \n\r  \nWell no sh\\_t.\r  \n\r  \nThat's because each one of those encountered during an assault essentially stops the assault and turns into a reaction drill to deal with those individual threats. So they have to stop to work through those problems before continuing. Or they are suppressed to the point they can't do anything. Or they become casualties. Or they retreat. \n\nThat isn't how assaults are taught. Imagine going through the effort to set up a training lane to run students through an assault, start to finish, with all the complicated parts of it that are quite complicated (especially with the language barrier and knowing it's too short) and then having have to stop constantly to throw in a \"React to whatever\" scenario that stops the assault training in it's track the same way it would stop a mission in real life. It would take two damn months to make it to the consolidation phase of the assault...\n\nThe way it actually works, the way all of these NATO militaries train their own people, and how Ukraine trained their own too before they sacrificed training for the war effort, is that the trainees are first taught the individual skills they need to execute the collective task, namely shooting, moving, communicating, first aid, clearing a lane in a minefield, etc. Then they move on to learn small team level individual skills focusing on drills where decision making and teamwork is minimal (basic leapfrogging fire and maneuver, react to sniper, react to indirect fire, clear a trench, clear a room, etc). Then they move on to learn small team tactics of the sort that will necessitate more coordination (like conducting a squad attack), keep progressing all the way up to platoon level. Then they run those under stress, crawl, walk, run, empty weapons, blanks, then live fire, then maybe force on force with MILES or Sims or just blanks against an OPFOR. Maybe at night too, with force on force training especially including various contingency scenarios thrown in as the culminating event to make it tough.\r  \n\r  \nBut that's VERY advanced training, the type done in the unit as it goes through it's half a year or more combat train up. It's not something they will expected to learn in basic training of 3-5 weeks. \n\nAnd don't even get me started on the drone comments. Why would that be involved in basic training trying to teach infantry shit to privates? In real life, if they're spotted by drones outside cover, they're screwed. So what is the point of training on getting spotted by the enemy in basic training? Again, it just leads to a contingency immediate action battle drill. \n\nWhat they need to be taught is camo [like this](https://www.combatsportsupply.com/images/products/detail/P10_CR65_2.jpg)\\* or homemade thermal ponchos [like this](https://twitter.com/Tatarigami_UA/status/1650391631550468096), plus dispersion, how to move carefully and avoiding certain type of areas (the trails they love to use, natural lines of drift), etc. It's probably important to teach them a counter drone drill, like dropping prone, remain frozen in place (move and die), and melting into the vegetation or under cover. Maybe throw in a quick recommendation to shoot at the drones with small arms if they can. What else are they supposed to do?\n\nI'll say it again, as I did way back in May 22. The UAF need to be the ones running training. They need to take responsibility for it, especially since then they can change it themselves and don't need to rely on NATO, who they clearly feel superior to. They need to use Ukrainian instructors following their own curriculum that THEY standardize, bring their equipment with them, and just use NATO for training support. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Something like that was used by the Japanese, North Koreans, Chinese, and Vietnamese all because of aerial recon threat so they didn't get spotted. If the UAF are so worried about that threat, why does their personal camo suck? Why are they blaming the West? Why aren't their company, battalion, and brigade commanders telling them to veg up or get court martialed?",

And when it was recognized they needed training because this offensive showed major problems, NATO bailed them out. \n\nBringing this issue to the fore, giving honest criticism might be enough to force the UA govt and the GenStab to make the sacrifices needed to take over training.

I'm guessing his predecessors since 2014 created some weird traditions with presidential involvement in encirclements, since Mariupol was far from the first time that happened. But it was still on him. \n\nDuring the Donbas offensive, there was lots of circumstantial evidence during it that the UAF weren't allowed to perform an operational maneuver defense, which would be less costly and end up losing about the same amount of terrain they ended up losing, but were instead forced to hold ground, especially bad ground, for some sort of political reasons. Then RUSI outright said later that was the case, political interference prohibited a maneuver defense, which is what the UAF commanders wanted to execute. Though I don't buy the political reason that RUSI offered (protect civilians), it still proves it was political meddling.\n\nZelensky and his govt were the ones who hyped the August Counteroffensive against the South, which was originally only supposed to be against the South (a last minute change cancelled the Tokmak axis and included the Kharkiv counteroffensive). That wasn't a deception plan, that was blatant telegraphing because hyping the offensive gave him something positive to talk about. \n\nZelensky seemed to be the one pushing to hold in Bakhmut, especially when things got bad in January.

So that's twice he did it, two times he deliberately gave up and semblance of surprise so he could use the future offensive for political benefit.\n\nNot to suggest it's all him. For example, I'm pretty sure Zaluzhny got picked up be the Commander in Chief of the UAF primarily because he's very sauve and especially nuanced with the media. \n\nBefore the war, I noticed him blatantly sucking up to NATO, \"I want to be you!\" type of articles written where he kissing butts like a pro. Wow, it was so over the top. He sweet talked NATO and the support we gave the UAF that he really sold the idea that UAF were basically NATO, which has become blatantly obvious since that isn't true, they actually copied little. Why was he saying that?

Many of them had earlier been invited to observe and cover the Joint Efforts 2021 exercise. This may be a sign of General Zaluzhny taking a new approach when it comes to the AFU\u2019s media policies. Considering the importance of quickly and widely disseminating one\u2019s informational narrative in modern-day conflicts, this shift perhaps could not have come soon enough. One of the bloggers, Donbas war veteran Martin Brest, bemoaned the fact that his posts on the Bayraktar UCAV strike received more online attention and reactions than the official press release published by the state-funded General Staff (Facebook.com, October 31).\n\nNote, Zaluzhny took over in July 2021. I don't think this is a coincidence.

But I wouldn't have to, because officers are taught now not to do that sort of thing. \n\nAnd God help the young soldier who tries doing something recklessly brave in combat, an NCO is going to rightfully rip their butt apart because then they risked others who are going to have to expose themselves to enemy fire to recover the idiot after they get hit playing hero. They might not, but that's the mindset today.\n\nI fought with Iraqi Security Forces and many routinely took reckless risks like the old days that were utterly amazing to watch, though incredibly stupid too.

And I&#39;ll especially remind them, &quot;what happens to troop morale and combat effectiveness when you get smoked doing something stupid?&quot; And I&#39;ll remind them that by doing that, they are also undermining me as a small unit leader. But I wouldn&#39;t have to, because officers are taught now not to do that sort of thing. </p>\n\n<p>And God help the young soldier who tries doing something recklessly brave in combat, an NCO is going to rightfully rip their butt apart because then they risked others who are going to have to expose themselves to enemy fire to recover the idiot after they get hit playing hero. They might not, but that&#39;s the mindset today.</p>\n\n<p>I fought with Iraqi Security Forces and many routinely took reckless risks like the old days that were utterly amazing to watch, though incredibly stupid too. But then again, many often used to cower, cry, and utterly lose their s--t in combat too. I think both were the result of culture and poor small unit leadership.</p>\n</div>",

Financially, eVTOLs are basing a core component of solvency in the near-term on carbon credits and penalties. That structurally changes the breakevens, liquidity and payback period analysis for this technology. Now, you can make ardent and valid market distortion arguments. This is a subsidy that won\u2019t benefit the average person at onset for sure. You can even argue the viability of such credits and penalties.

Financially, eVTOLs are basing a core component of solvency in the near-term on carbon credits and penalties. That structurally changes the breakevens, liquidity and payback period analysis for this technology. Now, you can make ardent and valid market distortion arguments. This is a subsidy that won\u2019t benefit the average person at onset for sure. You can even argue the viability of such credits and penalties.

Now, his government is taking the fight more directly to Beijing in a move that could force the US to make some tough choices.\n\n>Marcos this week ordered a \u201cspecial operation\u201d in which his coast guard removed a barrier installed by China at the entrance of the Scarborough Shoal, a chain of reefs and rocks the two sides claim as their own. Footage posted by the Philippine coast guard shows a knife-wielding man in scuba gear slicing through a rope connecting buoys that they say threatened fishermen and was \u201ca clear violation of international law.\u201d\n\n> The move, the coast guard says, is part of a strategy developed over several months to retake the area \u2014 a traditional fishing ground for the Philippines and its neighbors \u2014 which Beijing has effectively controlled since 2012 after a weeks-long standoff with Manila. China Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin quickly warned the Philippines \u201cnot to make provocations or seek troubles.\u201d\n\n> The Philippine coast guard said it intends to sustain patrols in the shoal, though neither Marcos nor his senior defense, military and foreign affairs officials made any statements on the plan on Scarborough Shoal. There are questions about how far Manila is willing to go and whether the US \u2014 which has remained quiet on the latest developments \u2014 would really have its back if the situation escalates. America\u2019s muted response to a crisis over the same shoal more than a decade ago preceded China\u2019s takeover of the area.\n\n> \u201cOur mutual defense treaties would lose most if not all of their credibility if we stayed out of it,\u201d said Carl Schuster, a former operations director at US Pacific Command\u2019s Joint Intelligence Center. \u201cThe US cannot leave the Philippines in the lurch.\u201d\n\n> Officials at the US State Department didn\u2019t immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.\n\n>One thing is clear: the barrier\u2019s removal \u2014 and the coast guard\u2019s suggestion of more action to come \u2014 all but closes the chapter on an era of foreign policy under former President Rodrigo Duterte that veered toward China. And with tensions rising in the South China Sea, it represents a growing assertiveness in the Philippines\u2019 bid to protect its sovereignty from a far bigger and more powerful foe.\n\n> \u201cWhat it marks is a clear change from the Duterte approach of being nice to China and hoping that that would protect the Philippines from problems,\u201d said Bill Hayton, author of The South China Sea: The Struggle for Power in Asia. \u201cThat the Americans clarified its mutual defense treaty means that there\u2019s a bit more willingness on the Philippine side to go toe-to-toe.\u201d\n\n>The Scarborough Shoal, in particular, is a sore point in the Philippines\u2019 alliance with the US. Duterte\u2019s Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin would years later blame the Obama administration for failing to stop China from seizing the shoal in 2012 after the standoff.\n\n>At that time, the Philippines withdrew its vessels from the waters surrounding the reef following negotiations that included the US. Duterte had said China, in turn, didn\u2019t honor an agreement to also pull its ships, and instead occupied the area. And the US did nothing, according to Locsin.\n\n> Crucially, that served as a precursor to President Xi Jinping\u2019s move to build military installations throughout the South China Sea.\n\n> Since Marcos took office last year, Washington and Manila have expanded defense cooperation, with American forces able to access military outposts including some near Taiwan. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in July reiterated the US\u2019s \u201cironclad commitment\u201d to defend the Philippines, saying the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty covers coast guard vessels in the South China Sea.\n\n>The two sides are considering even more access for US troops and are planning joint exercises. The Philippines has also sought new partnerships with US allies like Japan and Australia and is even reportedly weighing the creation of artificial islands to install new command posts.\n\n> That hasn\u2019t stopped Beijing from asserting ownership over nearly all of the resource-rich sea. Nor has the fact those claims were refuted by an international arbitration panel at The Hague in 2016. The run-ins have been rising along with a record number of incursions by Chinese ships. In 2022, China\u2019s coast guard maintained near-daily patrols in the Second Thomas Shoal in the Spratly Islands, where the Philippines maintains a garrison.\n\n> The removal of structures such as a barrier isn\u2019t a new phenomena in the long running dispute between competing Asian claimants, with the dismantling of objects including sovereignty markers more of a common occurrence in the 1990s. Yet the Philippines\u2019 latest move risks angering China, which now has the world\u2019s largest navy by number of warships.\n\n>>\u2018Megaphone Diplomacy\u2019\n\n>Whether China is \u201csending more ships or being more aggressive, there should be an anticipation of a response,\u201d said Rommel Ong, a retired rear admiral in the Philippine Navy. \u201cThis shows what we wanted to do in the last six years but couldn\u2019t do before. It\u2019s going beyond the megaphone diplomacy that we usually do.\u201d\n\n>To be sure, Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo this week said the South China Sea issue is not the only factor in the country\u2019s relationship with China, but that the Philippines seeks to manage dispute peacefully and through the rule of law. Beijing too, won\u2019t be rash, according to Dongshu Liu, assistant professor specializing in Chinese politics at the City University of Hong Kong.\n\n>\u201cChina will probably issue a strong statement, but isn\u2019t likely to take strong action,\u201d the professor said. \u201cChina wants to make sure that the conflict is under control.\u201d\n\n>The Philippines\u2019 newfound assertiveness can be explained, in part, by Southeast Asia\u2019s inability to take a tough stance on the maritime issue, despite countries from Vietnam to Indonesia facing similar situations. China and Southeast Asia have been working on a code of conduct meant to resolve confrontations, though talks have dragged on for two decades.\n\n> Coast Guard Commodore Jay Tarriela, who\u2019s among those at the frontlines of the Philippine operations in South China Sea, expressed confidence in their bid to retake the shoal.\n\n>\u201cI think they are going to have a hard time\u201d figuring out \u201chow to maintain the barrier because we also took away the anchor,\u201d he said.",

It is commonly assumed that in a war with China over Taiwan the US will have many allies willing to offer support and of those many will provide military assistance. The reality is in a scuffle over Taiwan we may receive limited support even from Japan and Australia. [A recent RAND report from 2023 for the Air Force stated they believed only 3 countries would provide limited support in case of a war with Taiwan.](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RRA900/RRA967-2/RAND_RRA967-2.pdf) Singapore, Japan, and Australia. Australia is the most likely to provide military support but the report assesses it that it will likely be minimal. As far as Japan here's two summary quotes from the report in regard to Japan who must work through many legal barriers in order to deploy the SDF beyond defending their own territory.\n\n>This means that such categories as OCA, SEAD, and CSAR/PR are highly unlikely but that DCA, airlift, aerial refueling, and SAR/PR are more possible, depending on the situation.\n\n>For Japan, there are two cases of maritime aggression for which it would be likely to respond. One is a Chinese attack on the Senkaku Islands; the other is an attack on Taiwan. \r\nBecause the former involves a set of islands over which the Japanese government maintains administrative control (and which the United States has declared falls under Article 5 of the U.S.-Japan security treaty), there is no question that Japan would be willing to support operations to defend or retake these islands. Tokyo would consider this an attack on Japan and would support any U.S. activity meant to defend them and turn back Chinese aggression. If the maritime aggression situation involves Taiwan, Japan\u2019s willingness to support any U.S. operation will depend on how the government defines the situation. If it appears limited or Japan is not attacked, Tokyo will likely declare any Chinese aggression against Taiwan as an \u201cimportant influence\u201d situation. As noted, Japanese forces would be legally limited to noncombat, rear-area support operations of U.S. forces in areas where combat is not occurring. Despite recent comments by Japanese officials that have been interpreted as Japan being willing to provide such support, this willingness to support U.S. operations remains uncertain. What Japan is willing to do will depend on the scale of the Chinese attack, how the attack started, and how the public perceives the invasion.122 Even without a direct attack on Japan, if the government perceives an unprovoked assault by China against Taiwan as clear and the threat or risk to Japan is evident, the government will be more willing to support the United States with activities beyond C2ISR, such as airlift and refueling. With all these activities\u2014even with \r\nC2ISR (which is the most likely)\u2014Japan will be willing to conduct them but \u201conly to the extent that [the] SDF is not regarded as directly supporting U.S. combat activities\u201d(which would violate the prohibition on integration with the use of force).123 If support activities are framed as violating this prohibition, then the government will likely be less willing to conduct these actions. Additionally, if a contingency is induced by Taiwan\u2019s behavior (such as declaring Independence), this would \u201csap\u201d government willingness to support U.S.-led efforts.124 Although \r\nTokyo would not be willing to conduct CSAR/PR if the government limits its definition of the situation as having only an \u201cimportant influence\u201d on Japan, it would be willing to conduct SAR/PR, but only in areas where combat is not taking place,125 including both Japanese waters and international waters.\n\nOther articles on the topic from CFR and Responsible Statecraft (who pulled from the WSJ article I actually wanted to read) show a Japan that recognizes the strategic importance of Taiwan to the US but refuses to out and out say that they will provide military support in case of a war with China.\n\n>Taiwan, in particular, has become increasingly relevant, with Japan\u2019s 2021 defense strategy [PDF] emphasizing for the first time the importance of maintaining stability across the Taiwan Strait for Japan\u2019s security. Biden and Suga released a joint statement expressing concern over Chinese behavior towards Taiwan, and Japanese defense officials have called for Japan to defend Taiwan in the event of war. In March 2021, the U.S. defense secretary and Japan\u2019s defense minister agreed that Washington and Tokyo would cooperate closely in any such conflict.\n\nAs always it's important to not make assumptions or believe that things will go your way when fighting an opponent. Right now a war with China is shaping up to be a difficult, probably friendless fight. We'd do well to start planning for that now.",

If the US defends Taiwan, it will be scary, and many people will want to back down, especially after mass casualty incidents. It would be like if Russia and China both intervened directly on behalf of Vietnam. However, if Japan gets involved in the fight as well, people would be pissed off.
