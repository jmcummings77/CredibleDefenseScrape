The deal helped clear the backlog sparked by the start of the war, but the corridor\u2019s closure could slow the next crop getting to market.\n> \n> Russia\u2019s exit from the pact also takes place as Ukraine makes headway in its counteroffensive in the southern part of the country. Massive drone attacks were reported on Tuesday, following the destruction of the main bridge linking Russia to Crimea.

Shipments via the European Union are also causing tensions with its neighbors.\n> \n> The costs of exporting by sea are likely to climb, partly due to higher insurance and freight rates, said Roman Slaston, head of the Ukrainian Agribusiness Club. He remained optimistic shipments could happen, but said it may take a few weeks to prepare.\n> \n> When Russia briefly suspended its involvement in the deal in October, it issued warnings to vessels sailing the corridor.

This might sound favourable to China on paper, as Korea was still an economic success story for most of the time period since then. But there are a few headwinds to consider for China, ranked in order of importance:\n\n(1) China may be stepping into a balance sheet recession, as the linked Reuters article indicates. The commonly cited figure for China's private and public debt figure is 250 to 350% of its GDP. This is actually in line with the level of indebtedness seen in developed economies, but China is, of course, not yet a developed economy. Korea had somewhat of a similar problem with debt that ended in the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, but nowhere near China's scale, the pain was sharp but quick, and the recovery was just as impressive.\n\n(2) Related to #1 above, it is not clear who or what can even help China, if they do step into a prolonged stagnation - it is simply too big. Korea could export its way out of trouble; China has more than 10x the GDP, the same option is not available, just as Japan found out in the 1990s. \n\nThe size may actually be China's biggest limiting factor. I think it is a double-edged sword, because its massive size allows for the creation of a massive, America-style single market where amazing things happen. But ultimately, our prosperity is dependent on the natural resources of this planet and our ability to harness it. Can our world handle another America, but with 4 times the population?\n\n(3) I don't need to dwell too much on demographics, as it is a well-known problem. Just three things need to be pointed out; that China's demographics is far worse than what Korea's was in 1994, China is aging fast relative to its level of wealth, and that #2 above prevents immigration from being the solution for China. Beijing may need to bring in an entire nation's worth of immigrants to make a difference.\n\nNone of this should be a cause for America to rest on its laurels, as its primacy is far from guaranteed - it is stupid to simply invoke the past instances where America saw off challenges from Japan or the USSR. China is far more powerful and has far more potential than any rivals that the US ever had to deal with, and even in the most bearish scenario for China's future economic prospects, it will give America enough heartache to contend with.",

A fun project: go though university course catalogues over that past few decades and see how many remedial math classes are scheduled over the years... it's definitely increasing.\n\nA couple quick ones about K-12:\n\nStudents are taught to depend on calculators way too early.  For example, they start using calculators when working with fractions before they fully understand fractions.  This means they don't get enough practice with fractions... but who cares, says most people: you care because unfamiliarity with regular fractions (number over a number) means when you get to more advanced stuff (functions over functions) where you're not just working with numbers and calculators can't help you, you're fucked.  \n\nSimilarly, student's aren't familiar with \"cancelling\", for example 21/15 being simplified to 7/3: I've seen students these days who don't even really understand that this is possible.  Well, the first day of calculus is limits and the definition of derivative, where you literally have to cancel in the context of functions over functions.  If you don't understand how fractions work, then you have to learn that *and* the new concepts of limits and derivatives: you're behind on the very first day of class.  \n\nI'm not talking about anything fancy: cancelling, common denominators, re-writing quotients over quotients (the explanation of the quotient rule and chain rule in calculus requires this) as a single quotient.  This is shit you should be 100% comfortable with -- and computationally 100% accurate with -- well before the end of elementary school.  No college student should ever add two quotients like this: x/y + w/z = (x+w)/(y+z).  In the same way that you'd never, ever mistakenly think that \"dogs are insects\", you should never, ever be making this mistake. .  You'd never see shit like this in the past.  Now you do.\n\nAnother side effect: you know the story where A&W's 1/3 pound burger failed because people didn't understand that 1/4 pound is less than 1/3 pound?  This is a good example because you're not given a math problem: you see the ad advertising a 1/3 pound burger and you instantaneously think that it's a ripoff because it's more expensive than a quarter pounder.  You might have a calculator right next to you that can tell you otherwise, but you never even think to use it because your unfamiliarity with fractions  means that this first thought is your last.\n\nAnother example:\n\nback in the day, in junior high school, I took a semester (maybe it was a year, I can't remember) of high school geometry.  This was a really important class because, for one thing, it showed a very different side of math, one that's not just computations and formulas.  The entire class was about proving geometric statements from a core set of basic principles.  (For example, when you have two parallel lines and a third line intersecting them, then the opposite angles are equal.)  Who cares, right?  In reality, almost no one... except: it's an amazing setting for learning logical thinking and reasoning.  \n\nWhere else can you learn this as a high school student?  \n\nA computer science class, if done right.. except from what I've seen, most \"computer science\" classes in high school are a total waste of time where students just manipulate html or css; not programming.  \n\nAn English class: this works in theory, you read a story and analyze it, giving reasonings for your conclusions.  But this is a humanity: you can bullshit your way through it in a way that doesn't work in math.  In math, your argument must be 100% solid.\n\nThese days: students do maybe 3 weeks of \"geometry\" in high school, but with zero proofs: maybe they memorize a few facts, but that's it.  It's an enormous sadness that they don't see this side of mathematics (the side in which most professional mathematicians work), and that they enter college with zero logical reasoning skills.\n\nAll this said, our best students are still really great, but I'd bet we're losing a lot of potential talent because K-12 is so terrible (another effect: it's watering down college-level classes as well.  We make our classes easier -- students learn less -- and we give easier grades: a lot of people who shouldn't pass, do.  Here's a thought: employers used to take a high school diploma to mean that a person had some basic knowledge and had the ability to learn new things.  Now, they want a college degree.  How much of this is because a high-school diploma now tells you nothing about the holder?  As college gets watered down, will employers demand graduate degrees?)\n\nAnyway, sorry for the long rant, but IMO this is a major problem for the US.  We won't be seeing serious effects for years, but eventually this will catch up to us UNLESS AI takes care of all our problems within the next 5-10 years (which, as I understand, it might), in which case we can all live like the humans in WALL-E with no care in the world.",

Ramaphosa\u2019s government is increasingly anxious to dissuade him from coming given a looming clash with Pretoria\u2019s legal obligations.  \n\u201cSouth Africa has obvious problems with executing a request to arrest and surrender President Putin\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009it would be inconsistent with our constitution to risk engaging in war with Russia,\u201d Ramaphosa said.  \nAs a member of the ICC, South Africa would risk breaking its own and international law if it sought to avoid arresting Putin, after the court indicted him on war crimes charges over child abductions in Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.  \nThe Rome Statute treaty underpinning the ICC does allow states to consult the court if they encounter problems executing its warrants, the avenue South Africa is now using. Ramaphosa declined to provide details of these consultations in the court papers.  \nPretoria previously used this route after it failed to honour an ICC request to arrest Omar al-Bashir, the former president of Sudan, on a South African visit in 2015. South Africa\u2019s arguments at the time were rebuffed by the court.  \nThe South African leader will again seek to convince Putin to stay away during a Russia-Africa summit in St Petersburg this month, Paul Mashatile, deputy president, has said.  \nThe court papers were revealed in a case brought by South Africa\u2019s main opposition Democratic Alliance to force Ramaphosa\u2019s government to execute the ICC warrant if Putin attends the gathering. Ramaphosa\u2019s office said it never opposed the release of the papers.  \nThe DA said to claim a threat of war from Russia was a \u201cflimsy\u201d and \u201cstrawman\u201d argument \u201cwhen the constitutional principle and both domestic and international law make the merits of this case crystal clear\u201d.  \nAnalysts have questioned whether Putin would want to leave Russia on a long journey to South Africa in the wake of the Wagner mutiny and with the war in Ukraine raging.\u00a0  \nRamaphosa has said that he will announce when a decision is made about Putin\u2019s attendance at the summit.",

He was always obsessed with making Brazil the Arbiter of the World, there is an actual heritage and pride in Brazil's for our history as a neutral party (since the Republic was born in the late 19th century, Brazil only sent a medical mission to WWI and an actual Expeditionary Force in WWII). The botched 1st iteration of the Iran nuclear deal was just another side of this. \n\nAlso, there is actual domestic discomfort about how much pro-US (or rather pro-Trump) Bolsonaro was. There is always a decent sized sector within Brazil that wants us to side with the US no matter that, this discussion is actually a leak from domestic policies, but even for a decent part of this pro-Western sector, Bolsonaro went too deep into Trump's desires, pretty much siding Brazil as a lackey and accepting the end of our leadership in Latin America. So, Lula's started swinging a little too far on the other side, because the 2022 Elections were the first that I remember where foreign policies were actually a debated topic. Often the domestic matters are the only point discussed, but there was real discomfort on the inside with how subservient to Trump Bolsonaro was. Probably Lula mentioned this directly to Biden, consider how much focus the US had on Brazil early on, pretty much disarming a Bolsonaro coup before it took ground and inviting Lula to the White House very early on his term. \n\nBrazil's relations with Europe, specially continental Europe, were always great. France and Germany are two reliable partners in the 21st Century, we usually trust the EU far more than the US. Portugal and Italy are also usual allies. Macron and Sanchez pretty much cheerleads for Lula. Lula can't hold his mouth and he is slowly (very slowly) understanding that the West is pissed off with Russia. He said that he would invite Bush to a barbecue in order to end the Iraq War, he said that he would invite Chavez and Juan Carlos to dinner after the \"Por que no te callas?\", he is probably only understanding now that the West won't take his informal approach as gently now. \n\nNow, where will Brazil stand? It depends a lot. Lula does value the friendship of the EU a lot, on every term he had we had a focus on the Euro-Latin America relationship. Brazil and France actually created a bond that was strong enough for Bolsonaro to target as a part of his weird cultural war. But there's a lot of resentment between him and the US. The reiterated refusals of the US accepting us in the Security Council's permanent seat (even when literally all the other countries were OK with it), the bad blood left after the FTAA debacle, the significant bad blood after the NSA spying scandal, the desire to show he's not Bolsonaro and he won't automatically align with the US no matter that (the OECD refusal also bothers quite a few people, specially with how it happened, with Trump laughing the matter off the agenda after Bolsonaro came with every pride in the world saying that we were accepted), all of this weights. China is usually far more open to giving Brazil a significant leadership role as an emergent power and this was a point that Brazil always butt heads with the US for. Also, I'm sure he really believes the CIA helped the operation that sent him to jail. On the other hand, Lula has good relations with the Democrats. I mean, he had a communication channel with Bush as well (probably more than France after Iraq), but he was close to Obama and had reciprocal warmth with Biden. Brazil is pretty much a needy teenager, we want to hear from the world that we are a very nice cookie and very important to the diplomatic balance. As long as Xi continues to empower Brazil, specially our effort in spreading influence in Subsaharan Africa, Brazil will continue to balance itself as a friend of everyone, but the BRICS give us more. It will take some concessions from the US to shift us all the way back as an ally of the West.",

He said that he would invite Bush to a barbecue in order to end the Iraq War, he said that he would invite Chavez and Juan Carlos to dinner after the &quot;Por que no te callas?&quot;, he is probably only understanding now that the West won&#39;t take his informal approach as gently now. </p>\n\n<p>Now, where will Brazil stand? It depends a lot. Lula does value the friendship of the EU a lot, on every term he had we had a focus on the Euro-Latin America relationship. Brazil and France actually created a bond that was strong enough for Bolsonaro to target as a part of his weird cultural war. But there&#39;s a lot of resentment between him and the US. The reiterated refusals of the US accepting us in the Security Council&#39;s permanent seat (even when literally all the other countries were OK with it), the bad blood left after the FTAA debacle, the significant bad blood after the NSA spying scandal, the desire to show he&#39;s not Bolsonaro and he won&#39;t automatically align with the US no matter that (the OECD refusal also bothers quite a few people, specially with how it happened, with Trump laughing the matter off the agenda after Bolsonaro came with every pride in the world saying that we were accepted), all of this weights. China is usually far more open to giving Brazil a significant leadership role as an emergent power and this was a point that Brazil always butt heads with the US for. Also, I&#39;m sure he really believes the CIA helped the operation that sent him to jail. On the other hand, Lula has good relations with the Democrats. I mean, he had a communication channel with Bush as well (probably more than France after Iraq), but he was close to Obama and had reciprocal warmth with Biden. Brazil is pretty much a needy teenager, we want to hear from the world that we are a very nice cookie and very important to the diplomatic balance. As long as Xi continues to empower Brazil, specially our effort in spreading influence in Subsaharan Africa, Brazil will continue to balance itself as a friend of everyone, but the BRICS give us more. It will take some concessions from the US to shift us all the way back as an ally of the West.</p>\n</div>",

This course explains why many &quot;experts&quot; were surprised by Ukraine fighting and how they are completely wrong on the politics of Ukraine and the Ukrainian identity. </p>\n\n<p>Back to your question, I&#39;m a long time listener of the Ezra Klein show, and at the end of one of his podcasts with a foreign policy expert, Fareed Zakaria, he recommended a book called Wealth and Power. </p>\n\n<p>Podcast: <a href=\"https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS84MkZJMzVQeA/episode/ZWM0NzM1MzEtYmY2NC00YjJkLTg4MjQtMGZkM2NkY2E3NTUx?sa=X&amp;ved=0CAUQkfYCahcKEwjIqtnY4ZiAAxUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAg\">https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS84MkZJMzVQeA/episode/ZWM0NzM1MzEtYmY2NC00YjJkLTg4MjQtMGZkM2NkY2E3NTUx?sa=X&amp;ved=0CAUQkfYCahcKEwjIqtnY4ZiAAxUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAg</a></p>\n\n<p>Book: <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/161758/wealth-and-power-by-orville-schell-and-john-delury/\">https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/161758/wealth-and-power-by-orville-schell-and-john-delury/</a></p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve put that one on my reading list, yet still haven&#39;t gotten to it.</p>\n</div>",

Finding both insufficient on-hand inventories and inadequate production capacity, Hacker explores several approaches the United States could take to maintain its precision-strike advantage. He also challenges current assumptions about munitions production and consumption and assesses how U.S. strategy may need to adapt depending on conflict duration, operational objectives, and other scenario variables.

So it hasn't trained many (and also not being taught to a UAF standard, in terms of realistic theater specific TTPs). So at most, during the roughly 25 weeks that the training was available, they could have trained 15 battalions, which means the entire new 10th Operational Corps didn't even get it. There is a good chance they're not training 3x UAF battalions at a time (same unit is also running UAF basic training plus specialized training, so they're limited on resources and personnel), so it's also possible only five UAF battalions got the training so far.\n\nBesides the nine identified brigades of the 10th Corps is the rest of the UAF, well over a hundred brigades at this point. There were elements of existing units or those that are new and not equipped with western provided equipment, likely the 9th Strategic Reserve Corps. But we don't know who was in that, and there isn't even an abundance of proof that the 9th Corps is even real. But there was definitely some degree of a strategic reserve of existing units. They'd not have had the NATO combined arms training.\n\nMost of the UAF units identified in this offensive on the attack weren't from a reserve, weren't training to go on the offensive, but were on the line fighting defensively through the spring (many since last fall with almost no break at least at the brigade level). They definitely didn't get NATO training. Or likely any training besides minimal done when companies or battalions rotate out of the line for a few weeks. \n\n>No fire rationing, just Popasna-style fires for a month. In scenarios like that, minefields don't matter. \n\nYes they most certainly do. Fires isn't how to breach a minefield.\n\nPopasna took months to fall. They'd been hitting with arty since the war started but didn't start attacking it with ground attacks until April, so a full two months of assaults plus of heavy arty before the retreat was ordered, and only after high explosives essentially wiped out the defenses.\n\nI'm very happy the UAF finally got DPICM but their submunitions are the equivalent of a basic 40mm grenade launcher HEDP round going off, mixed frag (think small hand grenade) and very limited HEAT warhead. In comparison, a 152mm artillery HE shell has about 6,500 grams of high explosives inside, while a DPICM submunition has about 40 grams. DPICM are basically firecrackers in comparison to heavy artillery and will barely scratch well built fortifications.

                    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>Would NATO training and a few amazing tanks really make more of a difference than giving Ukraine a thousand 155 artillery pieces and ten million shells, plus equivalent amounts of mortars?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>NATO training should barely even come up in this discussion except for units that we know got it (like the 47th). </p>\n\n<p>For the most part it means an extremely abbreviated basic training meant only for infantry type junior enlisted, which is being done by about a half a different NATO countries, none to a standardized level, and not using Ukraine War tactics, techniques, procedures (TTPs) or using legit lessons learned to guide the curriculum (a major problem). </p>\n\n<p>Then there is some training on special equipment (artillery, tanks, air defenses, medical, etc) that typically ranges 3-5 weeks and not a Train the Trainer course (which is a problem, those not getting the training are not getting the training). </p>\n\n<p>Then there is a single US Army National Guard brigade who is running a 5 weeks combined arms training course since mid January, which can only train at most 3x UAF battalions at a time. So it hasn&#39;t trained many (and also not being taught to a UAF standard, in terms of realistic theater specific TTPs). So at most, during the roughly 25 weeks that the training was available, they could have trained 15 battalions, which means the entire new 10th Operational Corps didn&#39;t even get it. There is a good chance they&#39;re not training 3x UAF battalions at a time (same unit is also running UAF basic training plus specialized training, so they&#39;re limited on resources and personnel), so it&#39;s also possible only five UAF battalions got the training so far.</p>\n\n<p>Besides the nine identified brigades of the 10th Corps is the rest of the UAF, well over a hundred brigades at this point. There were elements of existing units or those that are new and not equipped with western provided equipment, likely the 9th Strategic Reserve Corps. But we don&#39;t know who was in that, and there isn&#39;t even an abundance of proof that the 9th Corps is even real. But there was definitely some degree of a strategic reserve of existing units. They&#39;d not have had the NATO combined arms training.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the UAF units identified in this offensive on the attack weren&#39;t from a reserve, weren&#39;t training to go on the offensive, but were on the line fighting defensively through the spring (many since last fall with almost no break at least at the brigade level). They definitely didn&#39;t get NATO training. Or likely any training besides minimal done when companies or battalions rotate out of the line for a few weeks. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>No fire rationing, just Popasna-style fires for a month. In scenarios like that, minefields don&#39;t matter. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes they most certainly do. Fires isn&#39;t how to breach a minefield.</p>\n\n<p>Popasna took months to fall. They&#39;d been hitting with arty since the war started but didn&#39;t start attacking it with ground attacks until April, so a full two months of assaults plus of heavy arty before the retreat was ordered, and only after high explosives essentially wiped out the defenses.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m very happy the UAF finally got DPICM but their submunitions are the equivalent of a basic 40mm grenade launcher HEDP round going off, mixed frag (think small hand grenade) and very limited HEAT warhead. In comparison, a 152mm artillery HE shell has about 6,500 grams of high explosives inside, while a DPICM submunition has about 40 grams. DPICM are basically firecrackers in comparison to heavy artillery and will barely scratch well built fortifications. They&#39;ll suppress well, be devastating for troops or possibly vehicles in the open (what it&#39;s intended for), but they cannot replicate a Popasna-type fires campaign.

Perhaps they felt the combination of dominant artillery, Ka-52s, and minefields was too much without wearing down one of those elements. Which makes sense. My understanding of the Great Minefield Disaster is that the L2R plow tank got popped by a Vikhr, the column stopped because green troops went into Oh Sh-- What Now mode, and then the shells started landing before they could get their heads un-effed. Reduction of artillery through sustained counterbattery this past month is a good way to lessen the risk of another Minefield Disaster.</p>\n\n<p>We&#39;ll see.</p>\n</div>",

But that was more of a fluke than anything. In terms of tactical air support, that was the result of a massive collection of air forces who'd prepared for the near impossible task of fighting the Soviet Union at the tactical level then being unleashed against the forward deployed poorly equipped conscript Iraqi Army infantry divisions for nearly two months as part of a larger air campaign that was mostly strategic in nature intending to defeat Saddam by breaking Iraqi morale, triggering chaos and revolt to include by terror tactics (targeting power and water).

Shoigu and Gerasimov are presumably in no more hurry than the rest of us to die in nuclear hellfire. You're also presenting a sort of paradox. Putin is simultaneously so weak that the only way for him to prevent his death is through the use of nuclear weapons but he's also so strong that no one will challenge him using nuclear weapons and dooming Russia to destruction?

And in a reminder of the threats Russia now faces, authorities on Monday said two Ukrainian drones caused explosions that killed two people and damaged the symbolic bridge to Crimea, the peninsula Putin annexed from Ukraine in 2014.\n\n>The implications for the budget will go far beyond the sheer price of fortifying positions in Ukraine that were manned by a group of Wagner fighters estimated at 50,000.\n\n>Building a larger security presence around Moscow \u2014 alongside committing more resources to the war effort \u2014 may prompt the government to increase spending by 5% relative to its current budget plan, according to Bloomberg Economics, meaning an extra 1.3 trillion rubles ($14 billion) of expenditure this year.\n\n>Another likely priority for Putin, as he looks for another six-year term in office, will be to buy off the electorate. A surge of around 12% in real wages accompanied previous election periods, Bloomberg Economics estimates, primarily as a result of pay hikes in the public sector.\n\n>The changing calculus caused by the rebellion will end up swelling what are already some of the biggest-ticket items in a budget that ran a deficit of 2.6 trillion rubles in the first half of 2023, or more than three-quarters of the total targeted by the government for the entire year.\n\n>The fiscal taps have been fully opened this year. Months before the mutiny, Putin announced an increase of 18.5% in the minimum wage from 2024, a hike that will extend to nearly 5 million people in Russia.\n\n>\u201cThere will be other handouts but they are likely to be very precisely targeted to alleviate poverty and reward those fighting in Ukraine and compensate their families,\u201d said Tatiana Orlova of Oxford Economics.\n\n>\u201cThe mutiny deepens fiscal stress and will derail government attempts to stabilize its budget balance. The public wage bill will rise as well to keep core voters\u2019 support heading into elections.\u201d\n\n>Wagner didn\u2019t come cheap before the uprising, with over $3 billion in outlays from the state budget in the past year to finance its military operations in Ukraine and pay its leader Yevgeny Prigozhin\u2019s catering company for supplying food to the army.\n\n>But a response to the critical threat posed to Putin\u2019s 24-year rule will make it a major new drag on the budget, adding to pre-electoral largesse.\n\n>Although the Russian leader still had an enviable approval rating of 76% in early July, according to a Public Opinion Foundation poll, that level of support is the lowest since last September, when the Kremlin announced a partial call-up of men to fight in Ukraine.\n\n>\u201cThe greater sense of uncertainty introduced by Prigozhin\u2019s mutiny might make the Kremlin willing to plough even more resources into buying the people\u2019s fealty to Putin\u2019s system, with the aim of reducing future surprises,\u201d said Ben Noble, associate professor of Russian politics at University College London\u2019s School of Slavonic and East European Studies.\n\n>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if, especially following the mutiny, the Kremlin were aiming for an even higher percentage of votes for Putin and a record turnout in the 2024 election \u2013 but that will be very expensive to secure,\u201d Noble said.\n\n>Redrawing the budget will be a challenge as sanctions and other restrictions imposed by the US and its allies over the invasion chip away at Russia\u2019s earnings from energy exports. Russia is also selling foreign currency while energy revenue is below the target set in the budget.\n\n>Rather than an increase in outlays on the military, \u201crejigging existing spending in favor of the regular army seems a more likely outcome,\u201d Orlova said.\n\n>\u201cThe Wagner episode discourages the state from outsourcing its military activities to private companies,\u201d she said.\n\n>Besides changing how the government calculates taxes on oil, efforts to stabilize public finances have largely relied on one-off measures such as levies on businesses and foreign companies preparing to pull out of the country.\n\n>But a more painful reckoning could be under way.\n\n>On the same day that Putin held extraordinary talks with Prigozhin and Wagner commanders after the uprising, a government meeting featured Finance Minister Anton Siluanov\u2019s suggestion of across-the-board spending cuts of 10% in next year\u2019s budget, according to the Russian business daily Vedomosti.\n\n>The proposal covers so-called unprotected expenditures \u2014 such as outlays on the environment and the economy \u2014 while sparing money earmarked for security and social support, Vedomosti reported.\n\n>Apart from sustaining Russia\u2019s ability to carry on with the war, government policies in the months ahead will filter through the economy in other ways, as a rapid build-up of military production already skews growth.\n\n>A push to stiffen the defenses after Wagner\u2019s march within 200 kilometers (124 miles) of Moscow will require enlisting more men for security forces. The risk is it will worsen labor shortages by crowding out the private sector, which is among reasons why Bloomberg Economics is reducing its estimate of Russia\u2019s potential growth.\n\n>Putin\u2019s priorities will be on display in the budget, adding to the high price tag in an election year.\n\n>\u201cThe pre-election period is a time of high tension for the budget,\u201d said Kirill Rogov, a former Russian government adviser who now heads Re:Russia, a Vienna-based think tank. \u201cSocial spending has to compensate for dissatisfaction with the war.\u201d",

August Pfluger, R-Texas, and Dr. Ami Bera, D-Calif., on Friday introduced the Gray Zone Defense Assessment Act along with Reps. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., and Dean Phillips, D-Minn. This bipartisan legislation directs the United States to develop a playbook to properly counter gray zone aggression and strengthen U.S. national security.\r  \n\r  \n\"The future of warfare is evolving,\" Pfluger said in a news release. \"We risk falling behind the curve if our nation fails to adapt and identify unconventional threats like information warfare, coercive investments and bribery, malign industrial policies, and more. The Gray Zone Defense Act is a critical first step in ensuring that the United States is prepared to assess and counter all threats to our national security.\"\r  \n\r  \n\"International conflicts in the 21st century have transcended traditional warfare boundaries, as demonstrated by Russia's persistent disinformation campaigns and the PRC's use of economic coercion to advance its political objectives,\" said Bera in the release. \"Yet, the United States lacks a unified strategy to counter these threats, resulting in diminished influence and incentivizing our rivals to continue utilizing such tactics. I'm proud to help introduce the bipartisan Gray Zone Defense Act to equip the United States with the necessary tools to evaluate and deter future nonconventional methods.\"\r  \n\r  \n\"Our adversaries routinely exploit the gray zone between statecraft and war to achieve their objectives without provoking an overwhelming military response from the United States and our allies. From China's island building in the South China Sea to Iran's proxy forces destabilizing the Middle East, the U.S. must strategically plan and execute effective, coordinated responses that span the range of our capabilities,\"Issa said. \"This legislation does just that by focusing new attention to shoring up our process and capabilities, particularly within the interagency and the State Department. That's why I'm supporting this important bipartisan effort to enhance our national security.\"\r  \n\r  \n\"The nature of warfare is changing,\" Phillips said. \"We've entered the era of great power competition, and we must ensure the United States is adequately prepared to identify and counter unconventional threats. The Gray Zone Defense Act provides crucial provisions to help the United States coordinate and counter malicious gray zone tactics.\"\r  \n\r  \nThe Gray Zone Defense Act requires the Department of Defense, the State Department, and the Director of National Intelligence to coordinate and evaluate our nation's capacity to respond to gray zone aggression. In addition, the bill requires the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence to conduct an annual assessment of the gray zone threats posed by the People's Republic of China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Cuba, and Syria pose to the United States.\r  \n\r  \nFor two decades, U.S. warfighters have primarily been engaged in countering the threats posed by violent extremists. Asymmetric tactics utilized by these extremist groups have shown our near-peer adversaries in the great-power competition that our nation is susceptible to threats that fall outside of the traditional means of conflict.\r  \n\r  \nSince the shift from countering violent extremism to the great power competition, Russia has used private military companies to illegally seize territories, the People's Republic of China is employing coercive economic practices through their Belt and Road Initiatives, and Iran is using proxies throughout the world to export terrorism and launder money for the regime. All these actions are used as an attempt to secure national objectives in what is now known as the \"Gray Zone.\"\r  \n\r  \nAlthough the definition of the gray zone is fluid, it is widely described as geopolitical, economic, military actions and cyber and information operations that go beyond regular diplomatic and economic activities but fall below the use of kinetic military force. Gray zone aggression has become the preferred method of adversarial governments because it exploits the weaknesses of Western nations and provides plausible deniability to the hostile actor.\r  \n\r  \nTactics utilized in the gray zone include but are not limited to:\r  \n\r  \n\u2022 Information warfare;\r  \n\r  \n\u2022 Encouraging internal strife within targeted countries;\r  \n\r  \n\u2022 Subversive economic practices;\r  \n\r  \n\u2022 Support for domestic and international proxies;\r  \n\r  \n\u2022 Coercive investment and bribery for political aims;\r  \n\r  \n\u2022 Industrial policy designed to monopolize a strategic industry or to destroy such an industry in other nations;\r  \n\r  \n\u2022 Military and paramilitary provocations and operations short of war;\r  \n\r  \n\u2022 Hostage diplomacy;\r  \n\r  \n\u2022 Changes in internationally recognized borders.",

This was the problem of the BEF in both World Wars, which took a massive beating in the early years and then suffered a sharp decline in quality, until the training and replacement systems had caught up with the war. Other nations that did focus on reserves had well-known systems for this and didn't really keep observers guessing too much (Prussia in the Franco-German War of 1870 and to some extent the military system of post-Marian-Reform Roman Republic and the early Roman Empire).\n\nIt also plagued the Japanese and German forces (notably their air forces) in the Second World War. Military skills need to be kept active and Russia's focus was not on that point during its drive for modernization.\n\nDespite what the outward image may have been before the war, Russia did have a fairly limited military budget for the size of its force. A large portion of that was spent on modern equipment, while full training and doctrinal reforms were not made, as these require a silly amount of finances (especially the training, especially for vehicle crews). \n\nThe outcome of this can be seen fairly well in the demise of the BTG. While an interesting idea on paper, the doctrine would have required excellent coordination between the troops and a near-perfect flow of information to leverage the massive firepower that the BTG has to compensate for the lack of infantry. This apparently didn't work and when it didn't work, the soldiers and commands were hard-pressed to adapt.\n\nTo me, this doesn't indicate a force that has trained manpower to spare. Also, if Russia had this focus on training, I think we would have seen an indication of that in other branches. While the army can't be that easily tracked in that regard, we do know that their navy and air force are seriously under-trained by NATO-standards. If their current forces are already undertrained, then their reserves are likely to be in far worse shape. This would preclude a large body of \"deep reserves\" and if that body did exist, I would be confused as to why it hasn't been brought to bear already.\n\nIf I missed something, I'd be happy to see my entire argument destroyed. Right now, most observations seem to indicate few decisive reserves on both sides, but often you do need to dig deep to bring the truth to light and I have no doubt that there are plenty of blind spots in my reasoning.",

New factories are not being built. Old factories are not being restarted. Tanks are not going into wartime production mode. The US is piecing together 31 Abrams hulls to send to Ukraine. There is no ramp-up going on here across NATO in terms of tanks. If more Leopards are to be sent, it will be because European armies are getting cannibalized.

It's still true that they technically have more units but they're currently rationing shells and are reportedly losing the artillery battle right now.\n\nI mean cruise missiles and long-range drones, and glide bombs to some extent. Ukraine is outclassed in all of these in terms of production and generally, in terms of capability. The newer missiles from UK and France outclass old soviet cruise missiles, but these are not in serial production for Ukraine, they will be used, and then they will be gone. Russia is building dozens of cruise missiles every month, according to Ukraine, and the UAF still has no reply to the Geran. They jerry-rig alibaba drones or old soviet recon planes here and there, but they are not as capable and not as numerous as Russia's serial production Gerans.

Russia has orders of magnitude more aircraft, of higher quality, newer generation, and wider operational breadth. There is not one area of air power where Ukraine outclasses Russia, not in fighters, bombers, ground attack, helicopters, etc... The GBAD of both sides minimizes the usefulness of airpower currently, but it's observably true that Ukraine is outclassed. \n\nAs far as EW assets, Ukraine has been outclassed in terms of jamming capability and number of jamming assets.",

I don't know a ton about the subject, I will admit, but I find it hard to believe that China has not turned an eye towards what has happened in Ukraine and reconsidered whether an attempt on Taiwan is really in its national interest. They'll keep talking about it, obviously the narrative is good for nationalistic chest-thumping and rallying the populace, but the actual value of taking Taiwan seems far less than the costs. With the population of Taiwan seemingly unwilling to outright declare independence, I feel as though the status quo will prevail because it works out best for everyone. But who knows, I may be overly optimistic myself. The obsession with the Thucydides trap, this neorealist idea that China and the US must go to war, really bugs the hell out of me honestly because no war is predetermined.
