At least nine people were killed in blasts on Friday in the camp on the outskirts of the city of Goma, local sources said...\n\n> ...DR Congo government spokesman Patrick Muyaya on Friday had also accused \"the Rwandan army and its M23 terrorist supporters\" of being responsible in a statement on X. Rwandan government spokesperson Yolande Makolo described the US comments as \"ridiculous,\" in a post on X. \"How do you come to this absurd conclusion? The RDF, a professional army, would never attack an IDP camp,\" she said. \"Look to the lawless FDLR and Wazalendo supported by the FARDC (the Congolese armed forces), for this kind of atrocity,\" she added.\n\nRwanda, underneath Kagame, has walked a fine line between pursuing their interests in the long-standing Tutsi-Hutu ethnic conflict in the Great Lakes region, to the point where [Burundi deployed troops on their northern border in February](https://www.africaintelligence.com/eastern-africa-and-the-horn/2024/02/28/burundi-militarises-border-as-fears-of-conflict-with-rwanda-grow,110185395-art), and making diplomatic overtures to Western and other international benefactors that have remained largely silent on the current events unfolding.

President Paul Kagame in turn has demanded that the DR Congo act against Hutu forces over ties with the perpetrators of Rwanda's 1994 genocide, which mostly targeted Tutsis.\n\nI think that it's very important to have at least some awareness of the conflict, because both Hutus and Tutsis as well as other ethnicities in the eastern DRC/Great Lakes regions have faced massacres and genocide by various state actors and militias for decades now. Rwanda backs the M23 group, which fights for Tutsi liberation (war crimes against Hutus) in the DRC, while the DRC backs the FDLR which fights for Hutu liberation (Tutsi ethnic cleansing) in the same region.

She cited the former Al Jazeera weekly show Sharia and Life, hosted by Yusuf Qaradawi (an Egyptian cleric who &quot;argues clearly and consistently that hatred of Israel and Jews is Islamically sanctioned&quot;).</p>\n\n<p>The organization held a 2008 on-air birthday party for Samir Kuntar, a Lebanese terrorist convicted of killing four Israelis who was released in July of that year, later admitting that its coverage of Kuntar&#39;s release violated its code of ethics.[146] The organization&#39;s Beirut bureau chief said, &quot;Brother Samir, we wish to celebrate your birthday with you&quot; and called him a &quot;pan-Arab hero.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And another good one, which did happen after the the incident you mentioned. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In late March 2024, Al Jazeera published a story alleging that IDF soldiers have committed rape at al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza. After an investigation by Hamas, it was found that the story was fabricated by a Gazan woman who wanted to &quot;arouse the nation&#39;s favor&quot;. Subsequently, Al Jazeera removed all relevant material without releasing a formal retraction.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

That population is big enough to have a very busy airport. \n\nThe building an airport is typically a 20 year ROI in terms of immediate impacts. So they'll have to build the airport, attract airlines, then convince them that it is worth the long term investment. \n\nHowever, about 5 years after the airport opens, you'll see huge economic ROIs. This is in the form of tourism or being an easy destination to get to. And getting more direct flights helps attract more business travel. Some notable exceptions to direct flights are southeast asia, large Australia, South America, Africa, and Canada. Getting direct flights to any of those places would increase business relations and return 2-5X in economic activity. \n\nThe next thing about airports is attracting airlines to make their airport a hub. When that happens, that increases foot traffic significantly and can increase economic activity/tourism even further. Warsaw is in a pretty good location to server as a hub for eastern Europe. Almost like Denver airport or Atlanta. Obviously, the wars are creating problems, but when the wars end (which they eventually will), that airport would be very well suited to become a major hub. The current airport is just too small to server as a hub. Oh and as a hub, that means more direct flights and more ease of travel to/from Poland. \n\nOh and once airports become successful, they easily sustain themselves, and become very profitable, on landing fees, parking fees, gate fees, and restaurant lease fees. \n\nSo yeah, putting the defense ideas aside, I think it is an extremely good idea for Poland to invest billions of dollars in a large, high end airport with at least 2 parallel runways, with the option to expand to 4 (LAX or ATL layout). \n\nOn the defense side, yeah, having more runways always helps. Especially if they can do parallel ops often. That essentially doubles the throughput of the airport. That can become really important in IFR conditions (clouds) because spacing requirements go up when visual separation isn't available.

I don't think becoming a hub is just a matter of attracting airlines, leaving out how this was supposed to work.

At least keep in mind Europe/EU at some point in the future banning short-haul or domestic flights outright, somehow like France did, is not entirely unconceivable. There's also a \"certain\" global warming side to it. In return I'll concede the Polish economy is better off compared to many in the EU, at least at this time, and that it's still lacking a major airport/hub (Chopin is indeed rather compact) despite being one of the continent's larger countries and economies. Whether that already makes a good case, or whether Prague say, or Budapest, wouldn't make at least as good spots for c*entral* European hubs (Poland is not eastern), well I'm not to decide.\n\nThe actual question was about military value, there I rather tend to be with the OP, feels like pretext. Obviously in case of war any infrastructure helps and lot of it is essential for survival. But central Europe isn't really lacking airfields, let alone military bases. On the contrary, in a world-war-like but still conventional scenario I'd expect the other side to take out (render inoperable) at least the big, public airports that close as one of the first things, if they can. And Warsaw is really close. NATO/US on the operational level not rather using their strongholds in UK, Germany, Italy, apart from carriers, doesn't sound realistic to me.

Here is an emphasized comment by another user about the modified terms hamas \"accepted\".\u00a0 American officials rejected Hamas's claims that it \"agreed\" to the ceasefire proposal presented to it, and according to them the terrorist organization actually returned a counter-answer - which includes changes. The counter offer, the sources told CNN, would require continued negotiations. They noted that Hamas made \"amendments\" to a previous proposal. In fact, Hamas demands in its new proposal to remove the right of veto on the \"heavy\" prisoners. In the Egyptian proposal, both sides have a veto - and thus Israel can actually prevent icons like Marwan Barghouti from being released. Another and particularly problematic section concerns\u00a0Hamas' refusal to release only living hostages in the first phase. Hamas announced that it is ready to release 33 hostages \"dead or alive\". In fact, the proposal says that Israel will only accept 18 hostages if it does not agree to the end of the war - and the other 15 only if it does. In this proposal,\u00a0Hamas refuses to exile its senior officials from Gaza. The keys to freeing prisoners are also different:\u00a0Hamas demands 30 prisoners instead of 20 for each [civilian] hostage, and 50 instead of 40 for each female soldier.\u00a0According to the proposal, which allows \"unobstructed\" movement to the northern Gaza Strip, in fact\u00a0Hamas also demands that armed men be brought into the northern Gaza Strip as well as dual-use materials that could be used as a means of warfare.\u00a0According to the publications in the Arab media of the proposal that Hamas agreed to, and of the previous proposal - these are the other differences between the versions: The proposal that Hamas agreed to includes\u00a042 days at each phase, compared to 40 days\u00a0in the previous proposal. According to the current agreement,\u00a0from the third day the IDF will withdraw completely from Rashid St. east to Salah al-Din St. (after the release of the first three hostages), compared to a withdrawal after seven days in the previous proposal (after the release of all the women). The current agreement states that\u00a0Hamas will release three hostages every week, compared to the release of three hostages every three days in the previous proposal. Another clause that was not included in the previous proposal is that\u00a0on the 22nd day of the first phase, Israel will \" release all prisoners from the Shalit deal who have been re-arrested \". In addition, the proposal to which Hamas said \"yes\" also includes giving permission to at least 50 terrorists to pass through the Rafah crossing from the very first day for medical treatment, instead of an \"agreed number\" of wounded terrorists who will be allowed to pass after the 14th day of the agreement. Another significant change concerns the second stage, and in fact the question of ending the war. The previous agreement spoke of \"completion of the agreement regarding the arrangements required to restore sustainable quiet\". The new agreement, on the other hand, says: \"Declaration of sustainable quiet (cessation of military operations and hostilities) and its entry into force even before the exchange of prisoners.\" The New York Times noted that the parties will probably clash over the meaning of this term. A source in the Middle East said that Hamas sees this term, \"sustainable quiet\", as the end of the war, when Israel stops military operations and withdraws from Gaza. The second source said the parties agreed to this term a few weeks ago, with Israel objecting to any reference to a \"permanent ceasefire\". In the third and final stage of the deal, the new proposal included a clause that was not in the previous one: \" a complete end to the siege on the Gaza Strip \".
