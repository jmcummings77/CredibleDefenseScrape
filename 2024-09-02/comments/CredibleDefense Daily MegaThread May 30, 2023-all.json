As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

Putting the country on more of a war footing in some way, as you say. Russia is currently doing everything it can (obviously), so far as it *doesn't* particularly impinge on day to day life. We might assume the regime can't muster the nation's resources in this fashion, or weather the public backlash, but our guesses about what the Kremlin can and can't do have a poor track record.\n\n1. Risking precious naval and air assets which are currently being conserved. The cost-benefit of this one seems particularly weak, but these things do exist.\n\n1. Chemical weapons. I think there's a tendency to think of them as strictly only useful as terror weapons against civilians, or poorly trained/equipped forces, but that's not really true. Long lived agents would make operating in an area, or with contaminated equipment, very arduous even for well prepared units. There would be a considerable impact on cohesion, and ultimately they *can* be used against civilians.\n\n1. Various kinds of undesirable behaviour outside the conflict zone. Sabotaging underwater cables, radicalising and transferring arms or restricted technology to dangerous groups, nuclear proliferation, political killings. It's not like it would be out of character.\n\nNow, in each case there are obvious costs and risks to the Kremlin, we perhaps assume those are why these things haven't been done. We might even relish the thought of sustained losses to Russian air and naval forces, or of the (presumed) international response that would follow some of those. We might see them as nails in the coffin of Russian chances and perhaps they would be.\n\nBut in each case they will suck for Ukraine or its supporters.

Ryan sat down with Mike Kofman to discuss the state of Russia\u2019s armed forces, the current state of the Western-led effort to train and equip Ukrainian forces and the latest from the battle for Bakhmut. The conversation also touched on the role of the British-supplied Storm Shadow cruise missile, Ukraine\u2019s ability to absorb the F-16, what exactly happened during the recent cross-border attack on Belgorod and revisited concerns about nuclear escalation.\n\nEdit, Summary:\n\nOn the Ukrainian offensive\n\n* Shaping operations started a few weeks ago including probing attacks along the line, the counterattack near Bakhmut to fix Russian forces, the C2/Logistics interdiction campaign that Ukraine has been conducting, and the Belgorod raid. \n\n* Main effort has not begun, Western equipment will not be part of backfill but for main effort. It'll begin when it begins, huge host of factors affecting it. \n\nRussian winter offensive\n\n* State of Russian military is an open question. Has shifted to defensive posture back in April. Given Ukraine an opportunity. \n\n* Tells us only small portion of Russian forces is capable of offensive action, Airborne and naval infantry. No longer capable of large scale combat operations due do degradation in quality of forces. \n\nBakhmut\n\n* Wagner, backed by Russian regulars were pressing Ukr out of Bakhmut but then some kind of event happened and Prigozhin started shitposting and said Wagner would withdraw by May 10. \n\n* Kofman speculates that Wagner was being sabotaged after a Wagner-friendly colonel general in charge of logistics and was providing supplies to Wagner was relieved and shortly after turned up in Wagner uniform. Motive is that winter offensive had failed and Russian military didn't want to be shown up by Wagner. Ironic that **both Russian and Ukrainian military strategies were to exhaust Wagner in Bakhmut**. (emf mine, this is almost unbelievable) \n\n* Ukrainian military launched localized counterattack with already deployed forces such as 3rd Assault Brigade. Russian flanks were in open fields and held by very low quality units. Goal of Syrskyi's \"defensive operation\" unclear. Could be to facilitate retreat, could be to set conditions for later, details unclear but no significant progress made. \n\nState of Russian forces\n\n* Major national recruitment campaign to address manpower issues but no second wave of mobilization. Need to replace casualties, rotate units, and generate forces. Barely stabilized Russian military before winter offensive, now suffering from structural manpower problems. Second wave of mobilization expected. \n\nWestern-trained Ukrainian brigades\n\n* 9 mostly motorized instead of mechanized infantry brigades trained and equipped by west, and three additional brigades available. Some unknown number of brigades being generated from rest of Ukrainian military and \"Offensive Guard\" generated by Ministry of Interior as national guard units. \n\n* Western brigades composed of mobilized personnel and a test of concept that with Western assistance Ukraine can engage in combined arms maneuver. Prospects of success unclear, no predictions other than it won't look like either Kherson or Kharkiv. \n\nStorm shadow\n\n* New capability for Ukrainian armed forces, long range (>200km), hard to intercept, significant payload. Comparable in some ways to ATACMS in terms of effects. Unknown number provided to Ukraine. \n\n* Will illustrate to what extent the challenge of striking Russian logistics/C2 is one of range vs other factors. Shouldn't expect same effect as GMLRS introduction due to Russian adaptation. \n\nF-16s\n\n* Ukraine ultimately needs to transition to Western platforms eventually, question was only of what platform.\n\n* Won't make much of a difference this year or next year. Depends on exactly what aircraft they get and what capabilities those aircraft come with. \n\n* Forget air superiority, not happening. \n\nBelgorod raid\n\n* Looks like GUR-sponsored raid. Lots of back and forth shelling in the region, initial breakthrough made supported by Ukrainian regular forces due to artillery barrage and tank presence. After breakthrough, two units of Russian  advanced in HMMWVs and MaxxPros advanced a few km and made a big spectacle. Russian units were, at least in part, self-avowed neo nazis. \n\n* Should expect to see more similar operations in the future. Operation had two objectives, politically to show vulnerability of Russia proper and militarily to force Russia to more seriously defend it's border and commit forces there instead of holding them in reserve. A lot more information-operation here than actual-operation. \n\n* On use of neo-nazi proxies, understand the purpose of the operation but think that the particular people involved is long-term unhelpful to Ukraine's cause. Evans notes that in major wars it's common for states to make sub-optimal choices, comparison to working with Stalin in WWII. Kofman: Ukrainian leadership should be careful about damaging Western perception of difference in values between Russia and Ukraine. \n\nBack to Bakhmut, was it a good idea? \n\n* Too early to tell, probably will be source of debate for years. Kofman hasn't changed his mind about pretty much any of it. Ukraine's choice to make, main driver was political symbology and contest of wills. Transitioned into a politically significant battle due to sunk-cost fallacies. \n\n* Battle was very costly to Ukrainian forces and Wagner but costs may not show up in upcoming offensive since Ukrainian forces for offensive not committed to this battle. Effects could show up after this summer however, after the offensive. \n\n* Only now that Bakhmut has fallen are Russian forces being fixed there as Wagner rotates out. Could end up being difficult to hold for Russia in the same way that it was difficult to hold for Ukraine. \n\nNuclear stuff\n\n* Perception of acute risk of nuclear escalation has dissipated but that doesn't mean it's gone away. Will likely come back this summer, especially if Ukraine achieves a breakthrough especially because the Russians may actually consider release. \n\n* Can't wish nuclear weapons away, some people have been gasslighting themselves into believing that tactical nuclear weapons have no practical uses and would achieve no battlefield effects. On the other hand, their threat hasn't particularly deterred the US or Europe. \n\n* US doesn't want to teach Russia or other countries that nuclear blackmail is profitable.",

For example, Kiev is about 20km long from north to south. Considering a low estimate for the range at 5km you'd need only 4 of them, if you want to \"surround\" the whole city (26x20km) you need around 20 of them.

For 250 millions you have a direct energy weapon from which enemy drones cannot defend themselves, except the enemy starts building more advanced and hence costlier systems (with stronger laser-resistant materials, etc.), with essentially infinite magazines and a cost per shot that is virtual zero. You can also overlap multiple systems.\n\nAnd this is a lower-estimate scenario, if they're effective at range of about 10km you'd need half of them.\n\nYou can layer the defense with HPM systems discussed above and anti-drone drones like coyote anti-drone missiles that at full rate production will likely [cost a few tens of thousands of dollars](https://twitter.com/AirPowerNEW1/status/1662950021707468801?s=20) (current prototypes at around 100k per piece) for the most difficult targets.\n\nYou're assuming that e.g. every substation need its own DE system, while actually layered DE defenses cover a much larger area than the single infrastructure.",

For 250 millions you have a direct energy weapon from which enemy drones cannot defend themselves, except the enemy starts building more advanced and hence costlier systems (with stronger laser-resistant materials, etc.), with essentially infinite magazines and a cost per shot that is virtual zero. You can also overlap multiple systems.</p>\n\n<p>And this is a lower-estimate scenario, if they&#39;re effective at range of about 10km you&#39;d need half of them.</p>\n\n<p>You can layer the defense with HPM systems discussed above and anti-drone drones like coyote anti-drone missiles that at full rate production will likely <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AirPowerNEW1/status/1662950021707468801?s=20\">cost a few tens of thousands of dollars</a> (current prototypes at around 100k per piece) for the most difficult targets.</p>\n\n<p>You&#39;re assuming that e.g. every substation need its own DE system, while actually layered DE defenses cover a much larger area than the single infrastructure.</p>\n</div>",

In WW2, Germany increased military production even while getting bombed. Factories are big, consist of multiple buildings, can be protected by air defenses, can be repaired if damaged, can be relocated underground or dispersed, and can be far from the front. Like, there are 50 car factories in the US. How is China going to destroy them?\n\nAnd by that logic, missiles are also useless, because you can destroy a missile factory using a stand-off munition as well.\n\nWhy would you need a huge logistics tail to launch Shaheds? The west could easily just fire Shahed-analogs from container ships sailing from the US\u2019s west coast to Japan, then firing over Japan to reach most of eastern and central China, or by dropping them out of cargo planes flying from Alaska.\n\nHow would you even detect launchers? They would be dispersed, with many decoys and stuff, and look just like regular trucks. The US was barely able to destroy any Scud launchers in Desert Storm. In a war between equal powers, with strong IADS and fighter cover, figuring out where anything is within the enemy\u2019s territory will be very hard.\n\nWhy do you need lots of people to launch Shaheds? Why wouldn\u2019t you need that many people to launch larger munitions?\n\nLots of people with RPGs can be useful against tanks in certain conditions, but they aren\u2019t even a good analogy. The RPG people have a hard time detecting tanks from a long way away, while the Shaheds are fired at known targets from 1000-2000 km away. Tanks can use cover, concealment, smoke, and maneuvering to avoid getting hit by RPGs, but stationary infrastructure cannot run or hide. Tanks have powerful optics and may be able to kill infantry before the infantry can fire, and supporting infantry can provide close-protection in urban areas and jungles and stuff, but finding and destroying distributed, mobile Shahed launchers that look just like regular trucks, which are protected by SAMs and fighters, and which are located 1000-2000 km away will be nearly impossible (much less shooting down aircraft which briefly enter the 2000 km range of the Shaheds, dump their load, and flee back to their base which could be very far away). Also, for wealthy countries, infantry are fairly expensive to train, and losing them will reduce future economic output, so you can\u2019t actually trade them against tanks at such lopsided ratios, but Shahed style drones are easily tradable, and the launchers aren\u2019t that expensive and are very hard to kill.",

If so, it's likely that no Switchblade 600 drones from that package have been provided to Ukraine thus far. Previously it took eight months deliver ten drones (first 10 drones were announced in April 2022 and were likely delivered only in January 2023, ie it took 8 months).\n\nContext: the SB600 drones are supplied through the USAI, this means that drones are not drawn from existing stock, but are ordered directly from the defense industry (with new contracts). Specifically, these drones are made by AeroVironment. AeroVironment is a publicly traded company and held an earnings call on March 6, 2023. During this call, they were asked about the drones from the February 2023 USAI package. Their response was that as of March 6, 2023, no orders for these donres had been placed by the US government yet (disappointing :( ).\n\nUSAI deliveries are typically very, very slow.

The Chinese jet was about 400 feet (122 meters) from the US plane, officials said.\n\n>Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington, denounced the US\u2019s frequent \u201cclose-in reconnaissance on China,\u201d saying it \u201cposes a serious danger to China\u2019s national security\u2019 He said in a statement that \u201cthe US\u2019s provocative and dangerous moves are the root cause of maritime security issues. China urges the US to stop such dangerous provocations, and stop deflecting blame on China.\u201d\n\n>The risky interaction comes with the two nuclear-armed powers mired in disagreements, from concerns about each other\u2019s military buildup to the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to curb Beijing\u2019s access to advanced semiconductors.\n\n>And while communication continues between agencies, China has rebuffed US requests for senior-level military talks. On Monday, China\u2019s military reaffirmed its rejection of a Pentagon request for the US and Chinese defense chiefs to meet at an upcoming security conference in Singapore. \n\n>Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin departed Tuesday for Japan, where he\u2019ll meet with government officials before heading to Singapore for the Shangri-La Dialogue.\n\n>The US says that military-to-military communication is necessary to prevent accidents or misunderstandings from spiraling into military conflict. China\u2019s embassy in Washington didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n>A senior US defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity said that the Pentagon doesn\u2019t believe these incidents are the result of Chinese pilots operating independently.

But he did say that \u201cshaping operations\u201d \u2014 that is, strikes that stretch Russian defenses and worry Moscow\u2019s planners about what\u2019s coming next \u2014 have already begun, which means the counteroffensive itself is likely to begin relatively soon.\n\nMYKHAILO PODOLYAK, a Zelenskyy adviser, seemed to confirm that shaping operations started this month in a CNN interview Tuesday. \u201cEverything that is happening now is a precursor to a counterattack, a necessary precondition,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked if he thought Ukraine could push Russia back out by the end of the year, Graham didn\u2019t say \u201cyes.\u201d. What he did say was that the initial priority should be \u201ctaking back some strategic locations.\u201d\n\nThe visit to the Ukrainian capital was Graham\u2019s third since the war began.

Graham believes the U.S. can make enough replacement ATACMS after they\u2019re delivered to Ukraine, even if the Pentagon fears it doesn\u2019t have any to spare.\n\nAnd he wants Congress to agree to a spending package that will send more equipment to Kyiv. It\u2019s unclear, though, if lawmakers will take up a weapons supplemental as they debate how to avoid a debt-limit crisis.\n\nThe senator said he told Zelenskyy: \u201cI will do everything in my power to ensure you have a robust package of weapons and technology to finish the job.\u201d",

Even Batchka-U turret on BMP-3M doesn&#39;t have commander&#39;s thermals, just image intensifiers.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>What does the Ukrainian experience show?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Amphibious operations with these supposedly &#39;amphibious&#39; vehicles don&#39;t work. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Change the dismount method then.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That&#39;s the point of BMP-3 Dragun and Manul IFV.

I don't have a lot info just this [article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1984/03/07/us-aid-to-britain-in-falklands-war-is-detailed/6e50e92e-3f4b-4768-97fb-57b5593994e6/). The satellite probably was useful to the navy but I think it could have functioned without. If anyone has any specifics on how that was used would be very curious. Aviation fuel obviously important and aircraft carriers are part of the navy. Britain doesn't produce much oil so doesn't produce enough aviation fuel. Seems like a leap to say its incapable of global action.\n\nWas Libya a French operation? I thought it was a nato one? I know basically nothing of the war so can't comment on it. France did get involved in Mali a year later and I cand find much on American involved in that.\n\nFinally, it's not like the US never has any allies when it goes to war. There are some in the past 30 years that had 0 allies but not a lot. Having an alliance system is not a bad thing. Could almost argue it is essential for global action. China which has a much bigger military budget and global plans than either Britain or France has much less involvement in global action. Could this be because they have few allies?",

I don&#39;t have a lot info just this <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1984/03/07/us-aid-to-britain-in-falklands-war-is-detailed/6e50e92e-3f4b-4768-97fb-57b5593994e6/\">article</a>. The satellite probably was useful to the navy but I think it could have functioned without. If anyone has any specifics on how that was used would be very curious. Aviation fuel obviously important and aircraft carriers are part of the navy. Britain doesn&#39;t produce much oil so doesn&#39;t produce enough aviation fuel. Seems like a leap to say its incapable of global action.</p>\n\n<p>Was Libya a French operation? I thought it was a nato one? I know basically nothing of the war so can&#39;t comment on it. France did get involved in Mali a year later and I cand find much on American involved in that.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, it&#39;s not like the US never has any allies when it goes to war. There are some in the past 30 years that had 0 allies but not a lot. Having an alliance system is not a bad thing. Could almost argue it is essential for global action. China which has a much bigger military budget and global plans than either Britain or France has much less involvement in global action. Could this be because they have few allies?</p>\n</div>",

Ukraine would need a much larger officer corps than it has now to both keep the frontline maintained and be able to train 1+ million soldiers simultaneously. Just promoting existing soldiers to officer roles haphazardly to create said training infrastructure will just result in a slew of officers unqualified for their roles with little training for the jobs they just got promoted to, a problem the Red Army had in spades in the aftermath of the purges.\n\nNext is civil administration and essential jobs. Ukraine needs soldiers, but it also needs emergency responders, firefighters, policemen, electricians, construction crews, port workers, train loaders, farmers, civil servants, factory workers making the guns and equipment to use at the front, and numerous other workers who are needed more than as soldiers on the frontline. Simply putting everyone in uniform would give you a large army, but if it comes at the expense of essential civilian services needed to keep the country in working order, then you risk implosion from the inside out. Nations like the German Empire ran into this problem where essentially every able-bodied man was sent to the front (Around 20-25% of the total population) and resulted in the collapse of their civil administration. In more complex economies like we have today, total mobilization pretty much can't be done on the same scale as nations did a century ago, nor should it.\n\nAnother factor is that large armies are not safe when amassing large numbers of troops for grand offensives. The world saw Russia's buildup for the initial invasion months before it happened in satellite images, and Russia certainly knows where Ukraine's anticipated counterattack is going to be based on having thousands of recon drones in the sky and satellites imaging the entire country constantly. Even with the best OPSEC in the world, today's technology makes it nearly impossible to hide the amassing of hundreds of thousands/millions of men for a grand offensive, and any formation of that size would be pounded with missiles before it could even start. Think of the Battle of Kursk where the USSR knew exactly where and when Germany would advance on the front, and pounded the German formations 2 days before the offensive even started and prepared extensive defensive fortifications around Kursk just as they've done in Zaporizhzhia.",
