This is what happened. The US was basically irrelevant. We didn't pay people to go die in the streets protesting. We also offered pretty meager support in and after 2014. \n\nAlso, Putin has been clear about his imperialistic view of Ukraine. There is little reason to believe NATO was the deciding factor, especially when he repeatedly refused to negotiate before (and after) the war with the west. Notably, Putin's reaction to Finland joining and basically surrounding west Russia with NATO was a shrug.

They put it together in September, October, and then all sudden, you\u2019ve still got those guys in the field in November? In December, it\u2019s like,\u00a0What are you doing?\u00a0No one exercises that long. What kind of exercise is that?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Interesting bit about the early warning signs of the invasion. This is what convinced me in January that they were going to invade even though it seemed insane. You simply don&#39;t move that much men and equipment for an excersize or a bluff. It&#39;s just too expensive, especially when you&#39;re a country with an economy like Russia&#39;s.</p>\n</div>",

When I assumed that 1200 KIAs could (note the <strong><em>could</em></strong>, that&#39;s important, even if you pretend not to get it) mean 3000 casualties, the W/K would be less than 2. 4800 casualties would be a W/K of 3:1.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It&#39;s not that difficult.</p>\n</div>",

In that case, the roughness of the figure might still be appropriate for the intended usage. Granulating that down to a single action or a single day isn't meaningful though because more likely if you have an estimate of kills you probably also have a solid estimate of casualties (particularly for your own soldiers).

A new order for a Patriot takes more than two years to be delivered, Hayes says. </p>\n\n<p>For NASAMS, six are on order for Ukraine, but \u201cthey won\u2019t see those until starting this summer, probably through next year,\u201d he says. Ukraine has received existing donated NASAMS, and officials have said they are highly effective at targeting Russian cruise missiles and UAVs.</p>\n\n<p>This demand signal does not take into account priorities that will be key for the U.S. in the Indo-Pacific region. For example, Hayes says the company\u2019s Standard Missile-6 is in \u201chuge demand.\u201d The U.S. Navy\u2019s stocks would currently last about seven days in a conflict and \u201cthat doesn\u2019t bode well for a long war,\u201d he says.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Lord have mercy the Pentagon is slow with contracts.</p>\n\n<p>Also ask Spain for their NASAMS and backfill them.</p>\n</div>",

Plus most of the intelligence was very classified and not meant to be divulged in court with a defense lawyer able to challenge every bit of it the same way a lawyer challenges a cop's last certification on using a radar speed gun or when the last time the DWI/DUI breathalyzer was officially calibrated and certified.\n\nWe had the same issue in Iraq during the SOFA turnover, about 4/5 of the detention centers were released because the Iraqis would only transfer over detainees who had sufficient evidence to convict in court. That's why most of the ISIS leadership were in US run camps, we'd captured them once but had to let them go in 09-10.\n\n>Wouldn't basically all of them have come via 'black sites' meaning there's a fair chance they actually did undergo 'advanced interrogation' of some form? These things can definitely be overplayed in reporting mind.\n\nThe advanced interrogations weren't very advanced. It was bracing and shit for the most part. I also know a fact that they were using... sexual favors at Gitmo to entice cooperation. But regardless, until years later, none of the intelligence gathering was done thinking it was to gain a legal conviction, and that was the problem. \n\nWith military tribunals and everyone involved being read in, in terms of classification, they didn't need to follow the rule of law because they weren't trials. But then the defense attorneys, actual military JAG officers following the legal theory that everyone deserves the best defense, chose a tactic to argue that the tribunals were unlawful, and it snowballed from there. \n\nThe US courts got into the matter, public opinion and politicians weighed in etc, and it became a giant shit storm.\n\nBut the whole reason that place existed through 8 years of Obama and now 2+ years under Biden is both know the reality, there are a lot of really bad people that if we release are going to cause major problems. It's easier just to keep the place open at minimal staffing to hold the dregs until they die of old age or something. \n\n>Also apparently it cost $540m a year just to run gitmo with its 650 prisoners. Was it heated by barrels of dollar bills or something??\n\nI have no idea what that number equates to. \n\nGitmo, the base, has nothing to do with the detention center, it's more about a Coast Guard base, and an expensive fuck you to Cuba at this point (haha, we have a base in your country and you can't kick us out). Whereas the detention center is just one small part of the windward side. \n\nDepending if they're still sorting them by security concerns, it might be expensive. There were actually like a half dozen different separate detention centers in the overall Camp Delta footprint, each based on different security concerns. For instance, I was only ever around those in Camp 4 because my unit did security in the guard towers there (that's the one in most photos, the rest were off limits to press), but the really bad guys were in other camps, and they follow Supermax type detention center rules, so that's notoriously expensive. \n\nBut like everything the US does, we spare no expense in wasting money.",

That&#39;s why most of the ISIS leadership were in US run camps, we&#39;d captured them once but had to let them go in 09-10.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Wouldn&#39;t basically all of them have come via &#39;black sites&#39; meaning there&#39;s a fair chance they actually did undergo &#39;advanced interrogation&#39; of some form? These things can definitely be overplayed in reporting mind.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The advanced interrogations weren&#39;t very advanced. It was bracing and shit for the most part. I also know a fact that they were using... sexual favors at Gitmo to entice cooperation. But regardless, until years later, none of the intelligence gathering was done thinking it was to gain a legal conviction, and that was the problem. </p>\n\n<p>With military tribunals and everyone involved being read in, in terms of classification, they didn&#39;t need to follow the rule of law because they weren&#39;t trials. But then the defense attorneys, actual military JAG officers following the legal theory that everyone deserves the best defense, chose a tactic to argue that the tribunals were unlawful, and it snowballed from there. </p>\n\n<p>The US courts got into the matter, public opinion and politicians weighed in etc, and it became a giant shit storm.</p>\n\n<p>But the whole reason that place existed through 8 years of Obama and now 2+ years under Biden is both know the reality, there are a lot of really bad people that if we release are going to cause major problems. It&#39;s easier just to keep the place open at minimal staffing to hold the dregs until they die of old age or something. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Also apparently it cost $540m a year just to run gitmo with its 650 prisoners. Was it heated by barrels of dollar bills or something??</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have no idea what that number equates to. </p>\n\n<p>Gitmo, the base, has nothing to do with the detention center, it&#39;s more about a Coast Guard base, and an expensive fuck you to Cuba at this point (haha, we have a base in your country and you can&#39;t kick us out). Whereas the detention center is just one small part of the windward side. </p>\n\n<p>Depending if they&#39;re still sorting them by security concerns, it might be expensive. There were actually like a half dozen different separate detention centers in the overall Camp Delta footprint, each based on different security concerns. For instance, I was only ever around those in Camp 4 because my unit did security in the guard towers there (that&#39;s the one in most photos, the rest were off limits to press), but the really bad guys were in other camps, and they follow Supermax type detention center rules, so that&#39;s notoriously expensive. </p>\n\n<p>But like everything the US does, we spare no expense in wasting money.</p>\n</div>",
