This is according to the U.S. Air Force's top officer in Europe who also said the U.S. military is now looking to test this capability to see if it might help meet its own demands for additional ways to persistently monitor for, and engage, drone threats.*\n\n*Gen. James Hecker, head of U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), as well as Air Forces Africa (AFAFRICA) and NATO's Allied Air Command, provided the details about Ukraine's acoustic sensor network and related air and missile defense issues at a press roundtable that The War Zone and other outlets attended earlier today. This gathering took place on the sidelines of this year's Air & Space Forces Association Warfare Symposium, which opened today.*\n\n*\"At the unclassified level, Ukraine's done some pretty sophisticated things to get after [a] persistent ISR [intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance]\" picture of \"low altitude objects,\" Hecker explained. This now includes an acoustic sensor system that makes use of microphones designed to pick up and amplify ambient noise, he added.*\n\n*\"Think if you have a series of sensors, think of your cell phone, okay, with power to it, so it doesn't die, right? And then you put a microphone to kind of make the acoustics louder of one-way UAVs that are going overhead,\" Hecker explained. \"And you have \u2026 6,000 of these things all over the country. They've been successful in being able to pick up the one-way UAVs like Shahed 136s and those kinds of things.\"*\n\n*The Ukrainians have been able to use the acoustic sensor data \"to be able to track them and then eventually put that together, get that picture out to a mobile ... team that is further out, that now shoots it down with AAA [anti-aircraft artillery], [which] they train a guy in six hours how to utilize,\" Hecker added.*\n\n*How the acoustic sensor information is disseminated is unclear, but this could very well involve leveraging an existing ad hoc drone spotting network that Ukraine has had in place for some time now that allows volunteers to post alerts via the Telegram online messaging service.*\n\n*Most of Ukraine's counter-drone teams rely heavily on improvised weapon systems typically consisting of various types of machine guns and automatic cannons mounted on different types of light vehicles. Their means of spotting and tracking drones themselves, especially at night, are typically limited to very localized capabilities like night vision and thermal optics, laser pointers, and searchlights.*\n\n*Details about the Ukrainian acoustic sensor network have been \"briefed to several people now, including the Missile Defense Agency,\" Hecker added. \"We're looking at doing some tests to see if that's something we can export out into NATO.\"*\n\n*Hecker said that this kind of acoustic sensor capability could have applications outside of NATO, too, and potentially against other categories of aerial threats beyond drones. It's worth noting that before the widespread adoption of radar, the U.S. military and other armed forces around the world used various types of systems designed to detect incoming aircraft based on their acoustic signature. By the end of World War II, such systems had largely fallen into disuse.*\n\n*However, many modern aerial threats, including small, low-flying drones and cruise missiles, and stealthy crewed and uncrewed aircraft and missiles, present significant challenges to even current-generation radars. Gen. Hecker first mentioned the U.S. military's interest in Ukraine's acoustic sensor network at the roundtable today while talking about challenges NATO is facing in maintaining a persistent ISR picture when it comes to things like kamikaze drones and cruise missiles.*\n\n*\"What it does, you know, when it's airborne, it will give us a persistent picture, ISR picture, down to low altitude, where many of these one-way UAVs and cruise missiles operate at,\" Hecker said about the E-7A Wedgetail airborne early warning and control aircraft that the Air Force and NATO are in the process of acquiring. \"And it has a pretty good capability in the range that it can detect those type of threats.\"*\n\n*\"Unfortunately, they're [the E-7s] not coming off the line starting tomorrow,\" he continued. \"So we have to look for ... interim solutions.\"*\n\n*Acoustic sensors like the ones that Ukraine is now employing could be one such interim solution, and one that is also substantially cheaper to implement than something like a fleet of E-7s.*\n\n*Hecker also mentioned tethered aerostats with \"a payload on it that has the capacity to detect these one-way UAVs\" as something that he was hoping would be \"delivered\" within six months to a year. \"And now you get that for a long time, right? \u2026 it can stay up pretty much nonstop unless the winds get really struggling, and you may have to reel it down for a little bit.\"*\n\n*It's not immediately clear whether he was referring to a capability the U.S. military is planning to deploy in Europe or somewhere else, or something that might be happening elsewhere within NATO. The U.S. government did just recently approve a possible sale of aerostat-based aerial surveillance systems to Poland, which you can read more about here.*\n\n*Hecker specifically cited the use of long-range kamikaze drones by Iranian-backed groups, including the Houthis in Yemen, against U.S. forces on land and at sea across the Middle East in recent weeks as examples of how this threat is already expanding in scale and scope. Just on January 28, a kamikaze drone notably killed three U.S. service members at a forward base called Tower 22 in Jordan near the border with Syria.*",

Their means of spotting and tracking drones themselves, especially at night, are typically limited to very localized capabilities like night vision and thermal optics, laser pointers, and searchlights.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Details about the Ukrainian acoustic sensor network have been &quot;briefed to several people now, including the Missile Defense Agency,&quot; Hecker added. &quot;We&#39;re looking at doing some tests to see if that&#39;s something we can export out into NATO.&quot;</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Hecker said that this kind of acoustic sensor capability could have applications outside of NATO, too, and potentially against other categories of aerial threats beyond drones. It&#39;s worth noting that before the widespread adoption of radar, the U.S. military and other armed forces around the world used various types of systems designed to detect incoming aircraft based on their acoustic signature. By the end of World War II, such systems had largely fallen into disuse.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>However, many modern aerial threats, including small, low-flying drones and cruise missiles, and stealthy crewed and uncrewed aircraft and missiles, present significant challenges to even current-generation radars. Gen. Hecker first mentioned the U.S. military&#39;s interest in Ukraine&#39;s acoustic sensor network at the roundtable today while talking about challenges NATO is facing in maintaining a persistent ISR picture when it comes to things like kamikaze drones and cruise missiles.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>&quot;What it does, you know, when it&#39;s airborne, it will give us a persistent picture, ISR picture, down to low altitude, where many of these one-way UAVs and cruise missiles operate at,&quot; Hecker said about the E-7A Wedgetail airborne early warning and control aircraft that the Air Force and NATO are in the process of acquiring. &quot;And it has a pretty good capability in the range that it can detect those type of threats.&quot;</em></p>\n\n<p><em>&quot;Unfortunately, they&#39;re [the E-7s] not coming off the line starting tomorrow,&quot; he continued. &quot;So we have to look for ... interim solutions.&quot;</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Acoustic sensors like the ones that Ukraine is now employing could be one such interim solution, and one that is also substantially cheaper to implement than something like a fleet of E-7s.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Hecker also mentioned tethered aerostats with &quot;a payload on it that has the capacity to detect these one-way UAVs&quot; as something that he was hoping would be &quot;delivered&quot; within six months to a year. &quot;And now you get that for a long time, right? \u2026 it can stay up pretty much nonstop unless the winds get really struggling, and you may have to reel it down for a little bit.&quot;</em></p>\n\n<p><em>It&#39;s not immediately clear whether he was referring to a capability the U.S. military is planning to deploy in Europe or somewhere else, or something that might be happening elsewhere within NATO. The U.S. government did just recently approve a possible sale of aerostat-based aerial surveillance systems to Poland, which you can read more about here.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Hecker specifically cited the use of long-range kamikaze drones by Iranian-backed groups, including the Houthis in Yemen, against U.S. forces on land and at sea across the Middle East in recent weeks as examples of how this threat is already expanding in scale and scope. Just on January 28, a kamikaze drone notably killed three U.S. service members at a forward base called Tower 22 in Jordan near the border with Syria.</em></p>\n</div>",

Note: this is in no way an analysis of Ukraine\u2019s ability to attack these facilities or sustain the deep strike campaign, it\u2019s just a recap of what has happened thus far in refinery ops. Would like to compete a brief analysis in short order on Russian crude shipments where truly interesting things have been happening since October, and one on nat gas as we are well past the halfway point of winter.</p>\n</div>",

One can imagine the Russian public finding mass flaring a difficult option to swallow.

First, deem all long term supply contracts with European customers force majeure (it is worth pointing out that already RU is in breach of contract by insisting on payment for LTSC gas in roubles) Second impose a single buyer for all RU export gas. The EU buyer would impose a single price (linked to the US Henry Hub to ensure no RU influence over the price) on all RU gas exports. This would inevitably then be a much lower price than current prices (given HH pricing) Clearly Moscow may respond by reducing the amount of natural gas flows into Europe to zero.

I&#39;ve noticed a lot of the pro-Russian Anglosphere puts its own spin on events which often differs from the one you find propagated by pro-state actors in the russosphere, I think a few select English speaking &#39;influencers&#39; play a big role in creating their own stories that are then taken up by their followers, without any coordination with Russia.</p>\n\n<p>Many others are bots rather than trolls, tasked in setting and spreading the framing by sheer mass repetition.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "[Russian Military Objectives and Capacity in Ukraine Through 2024](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/russian-military-objectives-and-capacity-ukraine-through-2024)\n\nNew RUSI report dropped today, and it's actually quite an optimistic one. I've listed some key takeaways below. \n\nRussian Strategic Goals\n* Russia's strategic objective remains the subjugation of Ukraine, and it still believes that's its winning. \n\n* Russian intermediaries have provided surrender terms to Ukraine that remain laughably maximalist: ceding all territory currently held by Russia as well as Kharkiv and in some versions even Odessa, Ukraine must agree not to join NATO, and Ukraine must maintain a head of state approved by Russia. \n\n* Russian plans are to maintain pressure on Ukraine for the next few years to wear the Ukrainian military down to the breaking point, with the ultimate goal of victory in 2026. \n\nRussian Military Capacity\n* RUSI estimates that Russia had 360k troops in Ukraine at the start of the war, rising to 410k in June 2023 and 470k at the start of 2024. \n\n* Russian armed formations are similar at higher levels to the Soviet model (regiments, divisions, and combined arms armies) but have changed at below the regimental level. Battalions are now organized into different line and storm battalions and tend to operate in company groups which fight as small dispersed detachments. \n\n* Russian units are now often rotated out of the line and regenerated once they suffer ~30% casualties. \n\n* Kremlim believes it can sustain the current rate of attrition through 2025. \n\n* RUSI breaks down Russian equipment as follows: 4780 barrel artillery pieces (of which about 1k are SPGs), 1130 MLRS, 2060 tanks, 7080 other AFVs (mostly MTLBs, BMPs, and BTRs), 290 helicopters (110 are attack copters), and 310 jet aircraft. \n\n* Russian equipment is constrained by ammunition availability, especially for 220mm MLRS and 152mm artillery rounds of which supply is intermittent. \n\n* RUSI doesn't expect Russian force quality to improve if the current rate of attrition continues, but Russia is expected to be able to maintain a steady tempo throughout 2024. \n\nRussian Industrial Capacity \n* RUSI believes Russia had about 50 Iskandr missiles in their stockpile and was producing about 6 per month at the start of 2023. Despite the expenditure of dozens of these missiles over 2023 they believe Russia now has about 200 stockpiled. A similar dynamic has been observed with other key missiles including 9M727s and Kh-101s.\n\n* A more coherent and comprehensive approach to enforcing Western sanctions on Russia will be able to disrupt their ability to procure the Western-sourced components essential to the production of more complex weapons like missiles. For now, they can still procure what they need, but prices are about 30% higher than pre-war. \n\n* RUSI believes Russian industry is delivering 1500 tanks and 3000 AFVs to its forces annually. 80% of these deliveries are refurbished and modernized equipment pulled from storage. \n\n* **Russia should be able to maintain a steady supply of these refurbished vehicles through 2024, but in 2025 the quality of the remaining vehicles will slow the speed of refurbishment, and by 2026 Russia will have exhausted most of its available stocks**. They will transition to increased production of new vehicles, but it will be at a significantly slower pace. \n\n* **The most serious limitation for Russia is ammunition production.** To make significant territorial gains in 2025, the Russian MOD thinks they need to manufacture or acquire 4 million 152mm rounds and 1.6 million 122mm rounds in 2024. But Russian industry has reported that they produced 1 million 152mm rounds in 2023 and only expect to produce 1.3 million 152mm rounds and 800k 122mm rounds in 2024. The Russian MOD also thinks those 2024 figures are likely the maximum Russian industry can produce without building new factories and acquiring more raw materials, with a lead time of more than 5 years. RUSI estimates Russian production of artillery ammunition will plateau at 3 million rounds (including MLRS) over the next year or so. \n\n* Russia will have to draw down its approximately 3 million rounds remaining in storage to help bridge the gap, though most of it is in poor condition. **RUSI believes Russia received 2 million 122mm rounds from North Korea.**\n\nConclusions\n* The Russian theory of victory is possible if Ukraine's international partners don't properly resource the AFU in coming years.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/russian-military-objectives-and-capacity-ukraine-through-2024\">Russian Military Objectives and Capacity in Ukraine Through 2024</a></p>\n\n<p>New RUSI report dropped today, and it&#39;s actually quite an optimistic one. I&#39;ve listed some key takeaways below. </p>\n\n<p>Russian Strategic Goals\n* Russia&#39;s strategic objective remains the subjugation of Ukraine, and it still believes that&#39;s its winning. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Russian intermediaries have provided surrender terms to Ukraine that remain laughably maximalist: ceding all territory currently held by Russia as well as Kharkiv and in some versions even Odessa, Ukraine must agree not to join NATO, and Ukraine must maintain a head of state approved by Russia. </p></li>\n<li><p>Russian plans are to maintain pressure on Ukraine for the next few years to wear the Ukrainian military down to the breaking point, with the ultimate goal of victory in 2026. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Russian Military Capacity\n* RUSI estimates that Russia had 360k troops in Ukraine at the start of the war, rising to 410k in June 2023 and 470k at the start of 2024. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Russian armed formations are similar at higher levels to the Soviet model (regiments, divisions, and combined arms armies) but have changed at below the regimental level. Battalions are now organized into different line and storm battalions and tend to operate in company groups which fight as small dispersed detachments. </p></li>\n<li><p>Russian units are now often rotated out of the line and regenerated once they suffer ~30% casualties. </p></li>\n<li><p>Kremlim believes it can sustain the current rate of attrition through 2025. </p></li>\n<li><p>RUSI breaks down Russian equipment as follows: 4780 barrel artillery pieces (of which about 1k are SPGs), 1130 MLRS, 2060 tanks, 7080 other AFVs (mostly MTLBs, BMPs, and BTRs), 290 helicopters (110 are attack copters), and 310 jet aircraft. </p></li>\n<li><p>Russian equipment is constrained by ammunition availability, especially for 220mm MLRS and 152mm artillery rounds of which supply is intermittent. </p></li>\n<li><p>RUSI doesn&#39;t expect Russian force quality to improve if the current rate of attrition continues, but Russia is expected to be able to maintain a steady tempo throughout 2024. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Russian Industrial Capacity \n* RUSI believes Russia had about 50 Iskandr missiles in their stockpile and was producing about 6 per month at the start of 2023. Despite the expenditure of dozens of these missiles over 2023 they believe Russia now has about 200 stockpiled. A similar dynamic has been observed with other key missiles including 9M727s and Kh-101s.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>A more coherent and comprehensive approach to enforcing Western sanctions on Russia will be able to disrupt their ability to procure the Western-sourced components essential to the production of more complex weapons like missiles. For now, they can still procure what they need, but prices are about 30% higher than pre-war. </p></li>\n<li><p>RUSI believes Russian industry is delivering 1500 tanks and 3000 AFVs to its forces annually. 80% of these deliveries are refurbished and modernized equipment pulled from storage. </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Russia should be able to maintain a steady supply of these refurbished vehicles through 2024, but in 2025 the quality of the remaining vehicles will slow the speed of refurbishment, and by 2026 Russia will have exhausted most of its available stocks</strong>. They will transition to increased production of new vehicles, but it will be at a significantly slower pace. </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>The most serious limitation for Russia is ammunition production.</strong> To make significant territorial gains in 2025, the Russian MOD thinks they need to manufacture or acquire 4 million 152mm rounds and 1.6 million 122mm rounds in 2024. But Russian industry has reported that they produced 1 million 152mm rounds in 2023 and only expect to produce 1.3 million 152mm rounds and 800k 122mm rounds in 2024. The Russian MOD also thinks those 2024 figures are likely the maximum Russian industry can produce without building new factories and acquiring more raw materials, with a lead time of more than 5 years. RUSI estimates Russian production of artillery ammunition will plateau at 3 million rounds (including MLRS) over the next year or so. </p></li>\n<li><p>Russia will have to draw down its approximately 3 million rounds remaining in storage to help bridge the gap, though most of it is in poor condition. <strong>RUSI believes Russia received 2 million 122mm rounds from North Korea.</strong></p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Conclusions\n* The Russian theory of victory is possible if Ukraine&#39;s international partners don&#39;t properly resource the AFU in coming years. If they do receive adequate support in terms of both ammunition and training, RUSI doesn&#39;t expect significant Russian gains in 2025. Without those gains, the Russian theory of victory falls apart. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Beyond 2026, attrition of Russian equipment will begin to materially degrade Russian combat power, further undermining the Russian theory of victory. This would be bolstered if Western partners meaningfully attempt to disrupt Russian defense manufacturing. </p></li>\n<li><p>&quot;Adopting an approach that aims to ensure Ukraine&#39;s resistance through 2025 not only undermines the Kremlin&#39;s theory of victory but also provides sufficient time to establish a rational mobilisation and training process for the AFU such that it can begin to qualitatively outmatch Russian forces, even if the latter continue to increase in overall size.

The Russians have went all in. Well, not fully, but far beyond what Ukraine and its Western supporters have done. The only way to overcome that is for the Ukrainians to double down on support for the war, which means accepting more sacrifices (military service, especially in combat arms) while accepting a further erosion of their economy and societal standard of living.

All or free, Ukraine will never be able to pay it back and it's not expected too. \n\nI don't need to guess whether Ukraine or the West have the resolve to do that, they already proved that they don't. \n\nAnd that's where RUSI and a lot of other public supporters of this war are trying to change. They don't like that outcome, they want Ukraine to win despite not knowing what victory means or having a realistic way to achieve. But nevertheless they're desperate and passionate so they're going to say anything and everything hoping other people sitting on the fence will agree with them, and turn the tap back on and give Ukraine what it needs.\n\nThe Afghanistan analogy finally works. We turned the tap off in 2011, at that point the Taliban were absolutely guaranteed to win. But we didn't actually quit supporting the war because everyone was very afraid of the outcome (see 2021 when it happened). To avert that, they supported Afghanistan with the bare minimum for an addition ten years without any strategy for victory or hope for positivity just because the alternative was defeat.\n\nThat's what is happening with Ukraine, whether or not it's true or not doesn't matter, pro-Ukraine supporters are obviously never going to admit it's a lost cause. They'll say what they need to say to keep the war going indefinitely. \n\nSo give as much as possible to Ukraine now and in the future, because Russia will be defeated!",

The entire premise of the RUSI strategy is that they've been hurt so bad so far, that if the present level of attrition continues for two years, despite refurbishing stockpiles and manufacturing new ones, the Russians can't make up. Which means right now the Russian AFV situation is that bad, to frame an entire strategy around it collapsing. \n\nAs a large, powerful, and respected think tank, RUSI has two missions. The first is to promote British military defense funding, period. The more the better, as long as it's directed to what RUSI experts think best (which is what their analysis is meant to do, influence decision makers).

But acquiring those vehicles would have its own associated costs. I'm also not sure where exactly Russia would source older vehicles like this, as it would likely require countries to retire parts of their existing fleets in what, the hope that Russia would provide them with more advanced kit at a later date? Plus, many of the countries that could provide them with such gear are unlikely to do so out of fear of consequences from the West. On top of that, chances are they'd be receiving old outdated equipment that would require extensive refurbishment and/or modernization. That being said, it shouldn't be totally discounted and might make a difference on the margins. \n\n>The draw down rate assumption is especially questionable, since we know a large amount of draw downs have been to equip new units rather than to replenish losses.\n\nTrue, but their point still stands. Russia will have to start cannibalizing parts of its existing force in order to equip its forces in Ukraine and/or equip their forces with increasingly decrepit and ancient gear which will have a tangible impact on their overall combat effectiveness. \n\nPersonally, I think the biggest issue with their drawdown assumption is that it's based off the idea that current attrition rates continue indefinitely.

I've been saying it for years at this point. We essentially have dozens of semi-related plans to procure and provide equipment and munitions to Ukraine rather than a single unified plan that dozens of countries are contributing to. \n\nSide note: my understanding is that in terms of equipment, Ukraine is actually in decent shape for a while to come. Their equipment attrition rates are relatively low and they have a large stockpile to draw from (bolstered by thousands of pieces of captured equipment), on top of what they've received already from the West (hundreds of T-72s, dozens of Western tanks, hundreds of APCs and IFVs). The West needs to do more to provide Ukraine with things like M113s and IFVs in general, but mostly Ukraine is constrained by ammunition availability rather than actual equipment deficiencies.",

You&#39;re free to &quot;mourn&quot; how &quot;credible analysts&quot; have &quot;descended into non-serious drivel&quot;.  And I&#39;m free to show the reader who exactly this is coming from, and how much ground they have to stand on.</p>\n</div>",

They were already set up to do unit rotations, needed them done more in fact, to do a relief in place they are relieved by another unit instead of a subunit within the 110th or that was previously attached (very likely TDF, national guard, and random battalions belonging to other UAF brigades were serving under the 110th Bde command).\n\nIf the 3Rd Assault Bde is counterattacking, they should do it from outside the salient. The idea is to pull the Russians away from the crisis area, where they're strong now, hit them instead in a weak place and force the Russian tactical commander to make the decision to abandon the breakthrough effort to reinforce the collapsing sector that the UAF hit. At that point, the UAF either rush in forces into the crisis area after it's weakened to try to counterattack there to regain the supply routes and lost territory, or using the lull in the aggressive attacks to stabilize the situation with firm defenses, likely to conduct an unfettered retreat. But the point is don't enter the salient when it's at its most vulnerable. \n\nWe saw that in Bakhmut, 3rd Assault Bde launched that attack on the Russian 72nd Bde on the southern flank and that covered the UAF retreat from the remainder of the city, as the Russians were stuck responding to that crisis instead of trying to accomplish some sort of pursuit. \n\nIf there is a counterattack planned, I'm surprised it hasn't happened already. And the 3rd Bde shouldn't be inside the city manning defenses if they're also tasked with attacking, they should be just attacking. \n\nI'm not sure what the hell is going on. In all honesty this should never have gotten this far, Avdiivka was a lost cause for a while now.

The idea is to pull the Russians away from the crisis area, where they&#39;re strong now, hit them instead in a weak place and force the Russian tactical commander to make the decision to abandon the breakthrough effort to reinforce the collapsing sector that the UAF hit. At that point, the UAF either rush in forces into the crisis area after it&#39;s weakened to try to counterattack there to regain the supply routes and lost territory, or using the lull in the aggressive attacks to stabilize the situation with firm defenses, likely to conduct an unfettered retreat. But the point is don&#39;t enter the salient when it&#39;s at its most vulnerable. </p>\n\n<p>We saw that in Bakhmut, 3rd Assault Bde launched that attack on the Russian 72nd Bde on the southern flank and that covered the UAF retreat from the remainder of the city, as the Russians were stuck responding to that crisis instead of trying to accomplish some sort of pursuit. </p>\n\n<p>If there is a counterattack planned, I&#39;m surprised it hasn&#39;t happened already. And the 3rd Bde shouldn&#39;t be inside the city manning defenses if they&#39;re also tasked with attacking, they should be just attacking. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not sure what the hell is going on. In all honesty this should never have gotten this far, Avdiivka was a lost cause for a while now. We&#39;re basically debating whether a junky should more safely shoot up some fentanyl into his arm or between his toes.</p>\n</div>",

So in theory, if Zelensky did want to end the war ASAP, the various Azov and former Right Sector units all need to be...heavily attrited. \n\nI'm definitely not suggesting that's happening. The fact seems to be that the 3rd Assault Bde has turned into one of the better brigades, if for no other reason that the better ones might have suffered too much damage in 2023 to still maintain quality. And that might make them worth using as a \"fire brigade\" similar to how 47th Bde was sent to brigade, which was another very risky decision to send an exhausted brigade with a limited supply of the best offensively capable IFV in the whole UAF on a defensive mission. Yes they tore up the Russians but they also got hurt in the process, that following five months of getting hurt in Robotyne.\n\nBut that's par for the course with the UAF and especially Zelensky. He gets himself focused on defensive operations and ends up committing really good units to hold ground, which grinds them up. That happened in the Donbas, then at Bakhmut, and now in Avdiivka, so probably true of 3rd Assault Bde too. \n\nIf they're available and good, they're going into the shit.",

The US has denied any official contact.\n\nIts interesting what to make of this. One explanation is that its an attempt to bolster arguments against providing aid (i.e. we could just push Ukraine to accept the ceasefire and then wash our hands of this) - certainly the timing - just as the vote is being held would support such a interpretation. \n\nOn the other hand this could also be legitimate - its possible that Putin reads the current situation as being in the strongest position that he will be, and that as time goes the position will deteriorate (or at least there will be significant uncertainty about how the position will develop). This quote in particular I find interesting (from one of the Russian sources):\n\n> \"The Americans didn't believe Putin was genuine about a ceasefire - but he was and is - he is ready to discuss a ceasefire. But equally Putin is also ready to fight on for as long as it takes - and Russia can fight for as long as it takes,\"\n\nIts very emblematic of the messaging that Russia is putting out. \"Russia can fight forever\" - yet at the same time Putin is keen to at least pause the fighting? To me it speaks of a lack of confidence in their own position long term. If the long term trends are in their favor then it would make more sense to give fighting at least another year and see if they can capture more territory or even cause a crisis or even collapse in Ukrainian defence before trying to come to the table and freeze the conflict - and this way potentially gain more concessions than they could today.",
