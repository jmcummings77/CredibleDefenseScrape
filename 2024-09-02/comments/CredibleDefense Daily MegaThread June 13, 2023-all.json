As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

It initially appeared to come from enthusiasts\u2019 Twitter feeds and websites last year when the idea of transferring F-16 fighters to Ukraine from former European NATO countries\u2019 stocks was first mooted, and it popped up again earlier this year.\n\n> While there are likely more used F-16s available, elements in the enthusiast community suggest the F/A-18 might be a better solution because it\u2019s a more rugged design better suited to dispersed and austere airfields as Ukraine is currently being forced to do. The Hornet is also considered a better \u2018all-round\u2019 airplane and easier for training pilots and maintainers than the more \u2018highly-strung\u2019 F-16.\n\n> So has commentary on the Twitter-verse gained so much traction it is now filtering into mainstream media?\n\n> That said, the two writers of the AFR report \u2013 Phil Coorey and Andrew Tillet \u2013 are impeccably credentialled and respected journalists, so there is likely something to the story.\n\n> I am neither an engineer nor a pilot. Nor do I have primary-source knowledge of the conditions in which the approximately 40 remaining Hornets are currently being stored.\n\n> Region asked the ADF if it could comment on the current state of the retired Hornets, and received the following response: \u201cThe RAAF fleet of 71 F/A-18A/B Classic Hornet aircraft, associated spares and support equipment was progressively withdrawn from service from January 2019 to December 2021. Due to commercial-in-confidence considerations, no additional information can be provided on the commercial arrangements for the aircraft.\u201d\n\n> The last squadron of RAAF F/A-18A/Bs was retired in late 2021, while the other three squadrons handed back their jets in 2017, 2018, and 2020 in favour of new F-35As.\n\n> As far back as late 2019 when about half the RAAF\u2019s fleet had already been retired, I saw at least a dozen of the jets crowded tightly together under the old \u2018carport\u2019 shelters but otherwise out in the open at RAAF Williamtown. Even then, many had already been stripped of control surfaces, engines, panels and other components to keep the remaining jets flying.\n\n> From early 2019, Australia handed over at least 20 Hornets to Canada which still flies the similar CF-18A/B model to augment that fleet until its replacement enters service. A large cache of spares, including engines, was reportedly part of that deal. These jets were carefully hand-picked based on their maintenance records and remaining fatigue life. There have also been reports Malaysia took some of the RAAF\u2019s spares stocks to help keep its small fleet of eight F/A-18D Hornets flying.\n\n> Of the 75 Hornets the RAAF acquired, four crashed in service, 11 have been allocated to museums including the Australian War Memorial, plus the 20 that went to Canada. A deal mooted in 2020 to sell the remaining 40 Hornets to RAVN Aerospace (formerly called Air USA) has likely fallen through because that company failed to win a large US Air Force contract in 2021 to provide airborne adversary training services.\n\n> RAVN Aerospace has reportedly paid a deposit for the Hornets, so currently has the purchase rights to the jets. Instead of operating them itself, the company may be looking to act as an intermediatory to pass them on to Ukraine. But, in line with the US\u2019s International Trafficking in Arms Regulations (ITARS), such a move would require approval from the US Government\n\n> The AFR report states: \u201cAn Australian security expert advising the Ukrainian government confirmed negotiations were underway, but a specific deal is yet to be finalised.\u201d It also quotes another source saying the \u201cperfectly good aircraft\u201d could be made \u201coperational within four months\u201d.\n\n> The term \u201cperfectly good\u201d is likely a theoretical one. When withdrawn from service, the Hornet was still a very capable fighter, but most of the airframes delivered between 1984 and 1991 were worn out. The RAAF and its industry partner, Boeing, carefully conducted scheduled maintenance on the jets in their last few years with their specific withdrawal dates in mind. The last \u2018deep maintenance\u2019 of an RAAF Hornet was conducted in June 2020. Plus, the best 20 have already gone to Canada.\n\n> While the remaining jets may theoretically have a couple of years\u2019 service life left in them, that they could be made \u201coperational within four months\u201d appears to be wildly optimistic.\n\n> There is also no workforce in place to perform this work. The RAAF maintainers and engineers at Williamtown have been transferred to the new F-35A, while the Boeing workforce has dispersed, moving on to other aircraft or companies.\n\n> The small Boeing team that prepared the 11 museum Hornets did so at a relatively slow pace over a number of years. But making four jets operational in four months \u2013let alone 40 \u2013 would require a much larger workforce and spares holding.\n\n> One way to re-generate the Hornets could be to transfer them to the US Marine Corps or a European operator such as Spain, Switzerland, or Finland \u2013 which continue to operate them and have maintenance workforces in place \u2013 prior to delivery to Ukraine. But none of this will happen quickly.\n\n> Australia has come under increasing pressure from Ukraine to ramp up its donation of weapons systems and support to aid its war against Russia, and there are reports Prime Minister Anthony Albanese may be preparing a major announcement at July\u2019s NATO Summit in Lithuania.\n\n> There\u2019s no doubt Ukraine needs to bolster its dwindling air combat capabilities, but I\u2019m just not convinced former RAAF Hornets are the best option.",

If you allocate 50 hours of transit time per aircraft to get them to Europe, and another 200 hours of training per aircraft, you have maybe 250 hours of combat time, maximum, per airframe.

That assumes an average sortie length of something stupid like 8 hours. The Hornet doesn't really have the legs for that. With a centreline tank they're probably closer to 2 hours.

As a rapid response/surge strike capability, I think that the hornets could be valuable for their ability to threaten then deliver a lot of precision ordnance anywhere near the Russian border. This surge capability could also provide decent SEAD to a strike made up of other aircraft to break them through SHORAD without requiring the actual strike package to perform then SEAD duty it's self.

The climate at NAS Lemoore and NAS Cecil field isn't actually too different, but i'm not sure if there are any marine squadrons that are only land based. That would probably be the best comparison. \n\n\n> e: our conversation may be being overtaken by events: https://twitter.com/NOELreports/status/1668622736195989506 \n\n\nExciting developments!

The climate at NAS Lemoore and NAS Cecil field isn&#39;t actually too different, but i&#39;m not sure if there are any marine squadrons that are only land based. That would probably be the best comparison. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>e: our conversation may be being overtaken by events: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NOELreports/status/1668622736195989506\">https://twitter.com/NOELreports/status/1668622736195989506</a> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Exciting developments!

Unlike the old brigades, the \"new Western-trained\" ones have not performed well so far in the Southern offensive.\n\nFamiliar story in wars. The prewar trained army is always better than the either the mobilised reserves or those conscripted/volunteering. People with 10 years service in them are always going to be better than new formations until they find their feet. With Ukraine they were often years long veterans of the Donbas.\n\nBoth armies have lost chunks out of their prewar formations. But Ukraine has a structure in place to train and has managed to get about 4 months armoured warfare training into the noobs.\n\nThese guys had crash course training from those operating at the top of the game. They know the theory but they have to learn to apply that theory under fire. They have the Ukrainian old heads around who have done this all before and the training from the worlds leaders in armoured warfare.\n\n>The videos showing compulsory mobilisation in Ukrainian streets are also not inspiring confidence.\n\nMost jobs in the army are non combat. Those kind of people find a way to end up driving trucks, peeling potatoes or shifting stuff round warehouses.\n\nPeople who end up in combat roles in infantry are those idiot enough to really try hard in the fitness tests in basics. Think about it 100 Bradleys, another Hundred Strykers, Marders, CV90s etc. Its only a few thousand people who are the front end with the modern mech infantry.\n\nIf we are going to talk socio economics then this explains why western kit is so expensive. They have to compete with western labour market for people, so its hard hard hard to get enough soldiers. You then get people who really want to be one (sometimes in uncomfortable over keaness) so for the last 50 years they have constantly gone hard on expensive night sights, armour, engines, all that stuff. The equipment is built around small groups of highly motivated and highly trained people.\n\nSo all Ukraine has to do is sift 90 potato peelers and 10 mech infantry from every 100.",

With Ukraine they were often years long veterans of the Donbas.</p>\n\n<p>Both armies have lost chunks out of their prewar formations. But Ukraine has a structure in place to train and has managed to get about 4 months armoured warfare training into the noobs.</p>\n\n<p>These guys had crash course training from those operating at the top of the game. They know the theory but they have to learn to apply that theory under fire. They have the Ukrainian old heads around who have done this all before and the training from the worlds leaders in armoured warfare.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The videos showing compulsory mobilisation in Ukrainian streets are also not inspiring confidence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Most jobs in the army are non combat. Those kind of people find a way to end up driving trucks, peeling potatoes or shifting stuff round warehouses.</p>\n\n<p>People who end up in combat roles in infantry are those idiot enough to really try hard in the fitness tests in basics. Think about it 100 Bradleys, another Hundred Strykers, Marders, CV90s etc. Its only a few thousand people who are the front end with the modern mech infantry.</p>\n\n<p>If we are going to talk socio economics then this explains why western kit is so expensive. They have to compete with western labour market for people, so its hard hard hard to get enough soldiers. You then get people who really want to be one (sometimes in uncomfortable over keaness) so for the last 50 years they have constantly gone hard on expensive night sights, armour, engines, all that stuff. The equipment is built around small groups of highly motivated and highly trained people.</p>\n\n<p>So all Ukraine has to do is sift 90 potato peelers and 10 mech infantry from every 100.</p>\n</div>",

There was no hint that demand for gas would ever start to decline, and indeed, the Russian-European gas trade exceeded all Soviet-era calculations.\n\n> Now, however, the gas trade between Russia and China is likely to end by about 2060 or even earlier as a result of the global energy transition. Any hopes of developing this cooperation further (by increasing supply volumes, extending contracts, and so on) amounts to a risky bet that the transition to renewable energy will not happen as planned. In all likelihood, within a few decades, Power of Siberia 2 will become obsolete.\n\nHere's an interesting analysis of Power of Siberia 2 by Carnegie Politika. Some assumptions are being made, but the four discussed aspects are quite clear:\n\n1. __Capacity__. Power of Siberia 2 has less than one third of the capacity of what Russia used to sell to Europe. What's worse, due to geography, China is the only alternative to Europe.\n\n2. __Price__. For whatever reason, China requires a significant discount on Russian gas, even compared to Turkmenistan. This was already true for Power of Siberia 1. Maybe China doesn't view Russia as reliable. For example, what happens when Putin dies? On the other hand, Europe happily paid premium prices on Russian gas.\n\n3. __Costs__. Power of Siberia 2 is far longer than the European pipelines. Hence the transportation costs are far higher. Russia also needs to somehow buy gas turbins to build the pipeline.\n\n4. __Time__. When the Soviet Union invested in gas pipelines to Europe, gas was viewed as the future. Now, gas is viewed as a transitional source. There is much less time to recoup the investments.

He either is fed a very limited and inaccurate picture of how the war is going(see Girkin's criticism) or wants it to appear that way. Its possible that he purposely stated an arbitrarily high but plausible vehicle loss to justify Russia increasing vehicle production. I may be wrong, but I think we don't have visual evidence to support either side's claim of vehicle kills right now. Ukraine's claimed kills are just as suspect as Russia's.\n\nI will say that I find it highly unlikely Russia has suffered more vehicle losses than Ukraine since the start of this offensive about a week ago, and I've seen plenty of footage released from both sides this past week. It could be that Ukraine is sitting on a mountain of video footage that backs up their claims, but they are usually quick to release video evidence of kills.",

Density creates the economic conditions and political conditions that make rail viable.

But we can see with oil extraction in the US (being the world leader) we can do these things.....just certain regulatory compliance costs need to be put aside.\n\nIf one country takes a few weeks to greenlight a new mining operation while another (the US) takes anywhere from 2-5 years just for NEPA compliance let alone the lawsuits that add more time on....well.... we know where the investment will be made. \n\nAlso there was some issues with people resisting automation which then made firms uncompetative.......\n\n> In fact, it's much easier to raise capital, assuming you have a good expectation of return, in the US than in China.\n\nWhen i mean capital i meant hard assets, factories, refineries, refined materials/inputs, etc. Yes in the US you have greater access to investment funds and it's easier to raise capital sure....\n\nI do consulting, enterprise applications. Had to go to shenzen and was given a tour. One Dutch guy mentioned it took him 3 days to find a place to build a prototype, setup an offshore office, get contracts setup for inputs, then find a place to do full production and he only realized a few months into going into full production that the multiple businesses/locations he worked with where within a few blocks of each other.

Hell NYC in the 1920s was a wild place. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>To get that density without crippling gridlock and massive dysfunction you need extremely high performance public transport, and very high efficiency municipal infrastructure, which is something the US seems not to be able to do anymore</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>First you get density then you get rail, <strong>the reason most places don&#39;t do rail is because there&#39;s not much density</strong>. Density creates the economic conditions and political conditions that make rail viable.  New York was dense prior to the subway, most of these Asian megacities where dense prior to their rail systems. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>you&#39;d be surprised to see that in fact US resource extraction often just got outcompeted</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>i know NEPA basically killed it. But we can see with oil extraction in the US (being the world leader) we can do these things.....just certain regulatory compliance costs need to be put aside.</p>\n\n<p>If one country takes a few weeks to greenlight a new mining operation while another (the US) takes anywhere from 2-5 years just for NEPA compliance let alone the lawsuits that add more time on....well.... we know where the investment will be made. </p>\n\n<p>Also there was some issues with people resisting automation which then made firms uncompetative.......</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In fact, it&#39;s much easier to raise capital, assuming you have a good expectation of return, in the US than in China.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When i mean capital i meant hard assets, factories, refineries, refined materials/inputs, etc. Yes in the US you have greater access to investment funds and it&#39;s easier to raise capital sure....</p>\n\n<p>I do consulting, enterprise applications. Had to go to shenzen and was given a tour. One Dutch guy mentioned it took him 3 days to find a place to build a prototype, setup an offshore office, get contracts setup for inputs, then find a place to do full production and he only realized a few months into going into full production that the multiple businesses/locations he worked with where within a few blocks of each other.

Tokyos transit for example or Swiss roadways and plenty of bridges. \n\nPlenty start with bone issuance for the initial funding. \n\nUsage fees are a good way of using price signals to determine if building something was worth it, the ROI on a bridge barely anyone uses comes out when you find usage fees don\u2019t cover long term maintenance.\n\n>energy is the smallest part of the budget \n\nDepends on the company. But also it\u2019s a single point that if energy costs go down it shifts **every single company** and individual cost downward. It\u2019s one of the few things that we know shifts the supply curve.

This includes items such as radar modes, engagement parameters, etc. But this is no more modifying the software than you changing the settings in Windows via Control Panel.</p>\n\n<p>The claim doesn&#39;t even make basic sense, Patriot has been tested against significantly faster threats than Kinzhal for over two decades, such as Hera which possessed nearly three times the terminal velocity.</p>\n</div>",

It is a beautiful ancient symbol on itself, but unfortunately mutilated beyond reuse due to the usage of it by Nazi Germany. Incidentally, the image from the Bronze age above also has Balkenkreuzes on it.\n\nAnd so I'm not apologizing, but pointing out that a symbol, this symbol, the Balkenkreuz is not necessarily synonymous with Nazi era ideology, which I find is implied here. If there was [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Flag_of_Germany_%281935%E2%80%931945%2C_square_version%29.svg/220px-Flag_of_Germany_%281935%E2%80%931945%2C_square_version%29.svg.png) on their tank, you have more than a valid point.\n\nThe Balkenkreuz as we know it, became fashionable in late WW1, was used throughout WW2 by the German army and precedes the Nazi ideology. The Balkenkreuz was used as a tactical marker, to improve recognition by friendly forces.

Is it possible to calculate a missile's likeliness of hitting something important, similar to the iron dome in Israel? If a missile was aimed to fall upstream in the river by kyiv, can Ukraine see that information and therefore decide to not shoot it down? Would that be easy to do?\n\n2. We see a lot of civilian hits in Ukraine by these missiles. Are we sure that this is Russia missing, or is this possibly a result of missiles being shot down? I know that when a missile is shot down, the warhead doesn't have to detonate, and I wonder if the random civilian hits are sometimes caused by being knocked off course. Or do the missile interceptions usually occur much further out?\n\n3. Are some Russian missile subsets essentially worthless in terms of effective accuracy? Will a s-300 ground attack missile ever realistically hit a target in Kyiv if fired in belarus? Or are those things practically worthless in long range ground attack roles?",

If a missile was aimed to fall upstream in the river by kyiv, can Ukraine see that information and therefore decide to not shoot it down?\n\nUkraine and Israel have vastly different security concerns with these systems. Why would Russians *not* aim a cruise missile worth several platoons' annual salaries at an important target? There's no benefit in diverting that to a river. And since they are satellite guided and often follow very complex paths, you can't see if they are about to miss until very late. Meanwhile, the cruise missiles also take a long time to arrive at their targets, so local air defense crews can (and do) make fairly informed decisions about their interceptor availability and the threat levels of each target.\n\nIsrael, OTOH, faces ballistic targets (so it's possible to predict where they land quickly after they are detected) that have a much shorter flight time (so automation is necessary), and are so imprecise that they basically arrive in random locations around their cities (so the systems sometimes need to intercept to save lives but sometimes it would be a waste). None of these are really true for Russian cruise missiles; they are slow and they are always enough of a threat that it's worth it to intercept.",

A broad front allows the attacker to confuse the location of the main effort, to force the defender to spread itself thin, to fix forces in place, but stress the same for the attacker. The latter tends to only work well when the attacker has a numerical superiority in manpower and equipment, better interior lines of communication, and has a really good grasp of logistics, with enough supplies stockpiled to handle heavy fighting on multiple fronts.\n\nIn this sense, a major attack against Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk oblasts in the south have been anticipated since last July when basically everyone in the Ukrainian govt started talking up a big counteroffensive \"in the south.\" From then the Russians essentially went on the strategic defensive and started HEAVILY building defenses in depth. They expected an attack, and they were ready for it. So it's likely going to be a hard fight, which means more time and heavy losses for Ukraine.\n\nThe east is a different story, it's much more fluid, defenses aren't nearly as formidable, there are still weak points that can be exploited, and it is a strategically important area, it being the reason the current war exists since 2014.

The question is do they have the supplies to handle heavy fighting on multiple fronts and the means to effectively move them.\n\nThat said, I think the smartest thing the Ukrainians can do is wait another month or so and then launch a major attack in the Donbas, punch through LDNR defenses and try to retake a significant amount of Donetsk and cut the supply lines that lead west to the other sectors in the South.

If you recall the Kharkov offensive, there is an argument to be made that the Ukrainians reached their logistical limit and weren't actually stopped by the ad hoc defense that the Russians conducted.

My experience with following conflicts is that the way that leads to the most accurate predictions is to do these things: see what the two sides are claiming and break down what they claim to the simplest elements.

The majority of pacifists either belong to obscure religious sects or are simply humanitarians who object to the taking of life and prefer not to follow their thoughts beyond that point. But there is a minority of intellectual pacifists whose real though unadmitted motive appears to be hatred of western democracy and admiration of totalitarianism. Pacifist propaganda usually boils down to saying that one side is as bad as the other, but if one looks closely at the writings of younger intellectual pacifists, one finds that they do not by any means express impartial disapproval but are directed almost entirely against Britain and the United States. Moreover they do not as a rule condemn violence as such, but only violence used in defence of the western countries. The Russians, unlike the British, are not blamed for defending themselves by warlike means, and indeed all pacifist propaganda of this type avoids mention of Russia or China. It is not claimed, again, that the Indians should abjure violence in their struggle against the British. Pacifist literature abounds with equivocal remarks which, if they mean anything, appear to mean that statesmen of the type of Hitler are preferable to those of the type of Churchill, and that violence is perhaps excusable if it is violent enough. After the fall of France, the French pacifists, faced by a real choice which their English colleagues have not had to make, mostly went over to the Nazis, and in England there appears to have been some small overlap of membership between the Peace Pledge Union and the Blackshirts. Pacifist writers have written in praise of Carlyle, one of the intellectual fathers of Fascism.

                        "body": "Lots and lots of wisdom that is very applicable to the current day\n\n>A nationalist is one who thinks solely, or mainly, in terms of competitive prestige. He may be a positive or a negative nationalist \u2013 that is, he may use his mental energy either in boosting or in denigrating \u2013 but at any rate his thoughts always turn on victories, defeats, triumphs and humiliations. He sees history, especially contemporary history, as the endless rise and decline of great power units, and every event that happens seems to him a demonstration that his own side is on the up-grade and some hated rival is on the down-grade. But finally, it is important not to confuse nationalism with mere worship of success. The nationalist does not go on the principle of simply ganging up with the strongest side. On the contrary, having picked his side, he persuades himself that it is the strongest, and is able to stick to his belief even when the facts are overwhelmingly against him. Nationalism is power hunger tempered by self-deception. Every nationalist is capable of the most flagrant dishonesty, but he is also \u2013 since he is conscious of serving something bigger than himself \u2013 unshakeably certain of being in the right.\n\n...\n\n>Ten or twenty years ago, the form of nationalism most closely corresponding to Communism today was political Catholicism. Its most outstanding exponent \u2013 though he was perhaps an extreme case rather than a typical one \u2013 was G. K. Chesterton. Chesterton was a writer of considerable talent who chose to suppress both his sensibilities and his intellectual honesty in the cause of Roman Catholic propaganda. During the last twenty years or so of his life, his entire output was in reality an endless repetition of the same thing, under its laboured cleverness as simple and boring as \u2018Great is Diana of the Ephesians\u2019. Every book that he wrote, every paragraph, every sentence, every incident in every story, every scrap of dialogue, had to demonstrate beyond possibility of mistake the superiority of the Catholic over the Protestant or the pagan. But Chesterton was not content to think of this superiority as merely intellectual or spiritual: it had to be translated into terms of national prestige and military power, which entailed an ignorant idealization of the Latin countries, especially France. Chesterton had not lived long in France, and his picture of it \u2013 as a land of Catholic peasants incessantly singing the Marseillaise over glasses of red wine \u2013 had about as much relation to reality as Chu Chin Chow has to everyday life in Baghdad. And with this went not only an enormous over-estimation of French military power (both before and after 1914-18 he maintained that France, by itself, was stronger than Germany), but a silly and vulgar glorification of the actual process of war. Chesterton\u2019s battle poems, such as \u2018Lepanto\u2019 or \u2018The Ballad of Saint Barbara\u2019, make \u2018The Charge of the Light Brigade\u2019 read like a pacifist tract: they are perhaps the most tawdry bits of bombast to be found in our language. The interesting thing is that had the romantic rubbish which he habitually wrote about France and the French army been written by somebody else about Britain and the British army, he would have been the first to jeer. In home politics he was a Little Englander, a true hater of jingoism and imperialism, and according to his lights a true friend of democracy. Yet when he looked outwards into the international field, he could forsake his principles without even noticing he was doing so. Thus, his almost mystical belief in the virtues of democracy did not prevent him from admiring Mussolini. Mussolini had destroyed the representative government and the freedom of the press for which Chesterton had struggled so hard at home, but Mussolini was an Italian and had made Italy strong, and that settled the matter. Nor did Chesterton ever find a word to say about imperialism and the conquest of coloured races when they were practised by Italians or Frenchmen. His hold on reality, his literary taste, and even to some extent his moral sense, were dislocated as soon as his nationalistic loyalties were involved.\n\n...\n\n>But for an intellectual, transference has an important function which I have already mentioned shortly in connection with Chesterton. It makes it possible for him to be much more nationalistic \u2013 more vulgar, more silly, more malignant, more dishonest \u2013 than he could ever be on behalf of his native country, or any unit of which he had real knowledge. When one sees the slavish or boastful rubbish that is written about Stalin, the Red army, etc. by fairly intelligent and sensitive people, one realizes that this is only possible because some kind of dislocation has taken place. In societies such as ours, it is unusual for anyone describable as an intellectual to feel a very deep attachment to his own country. Public opinion \u2013 that is, the section of public opinion of which he as an intellectual is aware \u2013 will not allow him to do so. Most of the people surrounding him are sceptical and disaffected, and he may adopt the same attitude from imitativeness or sheer cowardice: in that case he will have abandoned the form of nationalism that lies nearest to hand without getting any closer to a genuinely internationalist outlook. He still feels the need for a Fatherland, and it is natural to look for one somewhere abroad. Having found it, he can wallow unrestrainedly in exactly those emotions from which he believes that he has emancipated himself.

There is no need to multiply instances. The point is that as soon as fear, hatred, jealousy and power worship are involved, the sense of reality becomes unhinged. And, as I have pointed out already, the sense of right and wrong becomes unhinged also. There is no crime, absolutely none, that cannot be condoned when \u2018our\u2019 side commits it. Even if one does not deny that the crime has happened, even if one knows that it is exactly the same crime as one has condemned in some other case, even if one admits in an intellectual sense that it is unjustified \u2013 still one cannot feel that it is wrong.

                        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Lots and lots of wisdom that is very applicable to the current day</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>A nationalist is one who thinks solely, or mainly, in terms of competitive prestige. He may be a positive or a negative nationalist \u2013 that is, he may use his mental energy either in boosting or in denigrating \u2013 but at any rate his thoughts always turn on victories, defeats, triumphs and humiliations. He sees history, especially contemporary history, as the endless rise and decline of great power units, and every event that happens seems to him a demonstration that his own side is on the up-grade and some hated rival is on the down-grade. But finally, it is important not to confuse nationalism with mere worship of success. The nationalist does not go on the principle of simply ganging up with the strongest side. On the contrary, having picked his side, he persuades himself that it is the strongest, and is able to stick to his belief even when the facts are overwhelmingly against him. Nationalism is power hunger tempered by self-deception. Every nationalist is capable of the most flagrant dishonesty, but he is also \u2013 since he is conscious of serving something bigger than himself \u2013 unshakeably certain of being in the right.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ten or twenty years ago, the form of nationalism most closely corresponding to Communism today was political Catholicism. Its most outstanding exponent \u2013 though he was perhaps an extreme case rather than a typical one \u2013 was G. K. Chesterton. Chesterton was a writer of considerable talent who chose to suppress both his sensibilities and his intellectual honesty in the cause of Roman Catholic propaganda. During the last twenty years or so of his life, his entire output was in reality an endless repetition of the same thing, under its laboured cleverness as simple and boring as \u2018Great is Diana of the Ephesians\u2019. Every book that he wrote, every paragraph, every sentence, every incident in every story, every scrap of dialogue, had to demonstrate beyond possibility of mistake the superiority of the Catholic over the Protestant or the pagan. But Chesterton was not content to think of this superiority as merely intellectual or spiritual: it had to be translated into terms of national prestige and military power, which entailed an ignorant idealization of the Latin countries, especially France. Chesterton had not lived long in France, and his picture of it \u2013 as a land of Catholic peasants incessantly singing the Marseillaise over glasses of red wine \u2013 had about as much relation to reality as Chu Chin Chow has to everyday life in Baghdad. And with this went not only an enormous over-estimation of French military power (both before and after 1914-18 he maintained that France, by itself, was stronger than Germany), but a silly and vulgar glorification of the actual process of war. Chesterton\u2019s battle poems, such as \u2018Lepanto\u2019 or \u2018The Ballad of Saint Barbara\u2019, make \u2018The Charge of the Light Brigade\u2019 read like a pacifist tract: they are perhaps the most tawdry bits of bombast to be found in our language. The interesting thing is that had the romantic rubbish which he habitually wrote about France and the French army been written by somebody else about Britain and the British army, he would have been the first to jeer. In home politics he was a Little Englander, a true hater of jingoism and imperialism, and according to his lights a true friend of democracy. Yet when he looked outwards into the international field, he could forsake his principles without even noticing he was doing so. Thus, his almost mystical belief in the virtues of democracy did not prevent him from admiring Mussolini. Mussolini had destroyed the representative government and the freedom of the press for which Chesterton had struggled so hard at home, but Mussolini was an Italian and had made Italy strong, and that settled the matter. Nor did Chesterton ever find a word to say about imperialism and the conquest of coloured races when they were practised by Italians or Frenchmen. His hold on reality, his literary taste, and even to some extent his moral sense, were dislocated as soon as his nationalistic loyalties were involved.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>But for an intellectual, transference has an important function which I have already mentioned shortly in connection with Chesterton. It makes it possible for him to be much more nationalistic \u2013 more vulgar, more silly, more malignant, more dishonest \u2013 than he could ever be on behalf of his native country, or any unit of which he had real knowledge. When one sees the slavish or boastful rubbish that is written about Stalin, the Red army, etc. by fairly intelligent and sensitive people, one realizes that this is only possible because some kind of dislocation has taken place. In societies such as ours, it is unusual for anyone describable as an intellectual to feel a very deep attachment to his own country. Public opinion \u2013 that is, the section of public opinion of which he as an intellectual is aware \u2013 will not allow him to do so. Most of the people surrounding him are sceptical and disaffected, and he may adopt the same attitude from imitativeness or sheer cowardice: in that case he will have abandoned the form of nationalism that lies nearest to hand without getting any closer to a genuinely internationalist outlook. He still feels the need for a Fatherland, and it is natural to look for one somewhere abroad. Having found it, he can wallow unrestrainedly in exactly those emotions from which he believes that he has emancipated himself. God, the King, the Empire, the Union Jack \u2013 all the overthrown idols can reappear under different names, and because they are not recognized for what they are they can be worshipped with a good conscience. Transferred nationalism, like the use of scapegoats, is a way of attaining salvation without altering one\u2019s conduct.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>All of these facts are grossly obvious if one\u2019s emotions do not happen to be involved: but to the kind of person named in each case they are also intolerable, and so they have to be denied, and false theories constructed upon their denial.

This sub is weird sometimes, it's a very legitimate question.\n\nIt's hard to assess how cost effective would tunnels be for Ukraine. \n\nThere are two types of tunnels, defensive and offensive. \n\nISIS, Nusra, Hezbollah and Hamas have utilized defensive tunnels with relatively significant success multiple times. Those are used for safely connect buildings in cities for movement and supplies, plus the ability to surprise enemy forces if they advance past and miss an entrance. They were a significant factor in battles such as the battle of Zavadani where it took almost 3 months for Hezbollah supported by IRGC and Syrian RG, with artillery and airforce support to dislodge Al Nusra from a single surrounded  town (technically they failed, and it ended in a brokered agreement that allows Nusra to withdraw to Idlib.\n\nThere are also good examples of such use by Hezbollah but not as well documented.\n\nThe problem with those is cost effectiveness. They take a long time to build, and so are costly. Hamas and Hezbollah invested many tens to hundreds of millions in building their defensive tunnels complexes. Something you want to do before the war, not during. Furthermore, you're not able to do so anywhere near an active front. And so you'll need to assess which cities sufficiently in the rear will become contested.

Why wouldn't Ukraine just use plain old artillery and HIMARS to deliver such strikes, which would be equivalent 95% of the time. \n\nFurthermore those methods were effective because Syrian and allied forces felt relatively safe to congregate in large numbers relatively near the front, exactly because their enemies lacked precise stand off strike capabilities, amplifying the effectiveness of tunnel bombings against key facilities near the front.\n\nI won't rule out that some offensive tunneling may be useful to some extents on some fronts, especially \"frozen\" but active ones like Marinka and Avdiivka. But then it doesn't seem like Ukraine is planning to push there, and thus it'd be a lot of wasted resources. \n\nLastly there's the threat of detection, which can either undo all the invested resources or even exploited.\n\nOn the grand scheme this war has long ago become a resource/manufacturing war.",
