Or is it the sanctions implemented by the west that make this war unsustainable in the long term?\n\nIn this future hypothetical, where both sides refuse to go on the offensive because of force parity, is that still sustainable for Russia or is even that cost too high in the long term?\n\nI know I'm inviting a lot of speculation, but thats half of what we do on this sub and I'm interested in hearing your guys thoughts.",

Can you point me to the piece of legislation that grants them that?

After the reform, the Israeli judiciary will still have much more power than the UK judicial system (on which Israeli judiciary and law were modeled).\n\nThe core problem with the Israeli judiciary is that just like the UK, it's structured in a way that it's not supposed to act as a constitutional court, as it was not one. When it unilaterally claimed such powers the system was imbalanced. There is no problem with having a constitutional court, but unlike in literally every other democracy, in Israel politicians (and thus the people)  have little to no say in which judges get appointed to the supreme court. After almost 3 decades of judges self nominating judges, the supreme court is almost entirely politically uniform.\n\nImagine if the supreme court in the US was all republican or democrat, and would overturn any decisions by the gov that they did not like. That's the situation in Israel, the left controls the supreme court, so even when the right wins elections, the left rules by obstruction of every gov and parliament action through the power of the supreme court (which in Israel is almost absolute).\n\nThe rule of law is not abandoned, it's quite literally the opposite.",

Now we are looking at the shore controlled by the Russians. We once thought that was unrealistic. Today it\u2019s very real.\u201d\n\n>When Russia seized Crimea in 2014, it also hijacked most of Ukraine\u2019s fleet. Kyiv lost more ships during the capture of its Azov Sea ports Berdyansk and Mariupol last year, although most Black Sea vessels left their bases before they were hit, on the advice of western intelligence, the vice-admiral said.\n\n>Since the war began, however, the US has donated at least 58 patrol boats, enabling Neizhpapa\u2019s force to dominate the Dnipro River and the coastal waters west of it, while Ukrainian sailors are training alongside the British Navy on two Sandown-class minehunters. Three Sea King helicopters, formerly British-owned, are already operating in Ukraine. Next year the Ukrainian navy will receive its first Turkish Ada-class anti-submarine corvette.\n\n>Neizhpapa\u2019s navy would still be vastly outgunned in a traditional sea battle by Russia\u2019s large modern missile frigates and submarines. So he has sought to fight an \u201casymmetric\u201d war in the Black Sea, exploiting surprise, subterfuge and Russian overconfidence.\n\n> \u201cWe have to act in an asymmetrical way against a more powerful enemy. We must use any means to deprive them of their dominance and destroy their fleet,\u201d he said. A key part of his strategy has been the development of fast, uncrewed vessels that streak across the surface of the water laden with explosives to strike at Russian ships in port, a modern equivalent of Sir Francis Drake\u2019s fire ships.\n\n>\u201cEveryone sees how much drones help us on the ground and destroy enemy equipment. So there is a desire to see how they would work at the sea,\u201d he added.\n\n>Three naval drones were last week caught on video tearing into the port of Sevastopol, Crimea\u2019s capital. One hit a defensive boom while two were stopped a few hundred metres away from Russian moorings by machinegun fire, exploding in enormous fireballs. Last October video showed the first such to be more successful, damaging the missile frigate Admiral Makarov and several other ships.\n\n>\u201cThis technology works,\u201d said Neizhpapa. \u201cWe were able to damage several ships using naval drones. Of course, the Russians are learning. We know that they have developed a new system for protecting their ports in response to our use of unmanned maritime vehicles.\u201d\n\n>Neutralising Moscow\u2019s use of Crimea is essential to protecting Ukrainian civilians from barrages of cruise missiles fired from Russia\u2019s Black Sea fleet, taking lives, destroying homes and damaging infrastructure. For his navy to do that, the West must unblock supplies of longer-range missile systems and modern jets, Neizhpapa said.\n\n>\u201cThe Russians use annexed Crimea and move along the entire coast, choosing positions to launch Kalibr missile strikes on Ukrainian cities beyond the range of our systems. That is why we need longer-range missiles \u2014 for example, the Harpoon Block II \u2014 to destroy those ships.\n\n>\u201cBut most importantly, they have air superiority over the Black Sea. Their aircraft are on combat duty there 24/7. We need new aircraft to assert air dominance, not only over our land but also our sea.\u201d\n\n>Neizhpapa, 47, graduated from Sevastopol\u2019s naval academy and has spent much of the past 30 years at sea with Ukraine\u2019s navy, including on joint operations with the Russian Black Sea fleet. He became commander of his country\u2019s navy in 2020.\n\n>The proudest moments in his career are sinking the Moskva, for which he was promoted from rear admiral to vice-admiral, and winning the battle for Snake Island, he said. Despite the shockwaves sent around the world by the sinking the Moskva, it was a routine act of coastal defence, Neizhpapa insisted, carried out without western involvement. Russia \u2014 and the world \u2014 had simply underestimated the Ukrainian navy, he said.\n\n> \u201cThere was no special operation to destroy the Moscow cruiser. I\u2019m not going to tell you how we discovered this group of ships, but I will say that it was all done by the Ukrainian navy alone,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we located this target, we chose the biggest one as the chances of hitting it were the highest. So we used two Neptune cruise missiles on this target. Of course, we understood that it was the Moskva because only the Moskva could possibly be that big.\u201d\n\n>The Moskva had a powerful missile and air defence system, including long-range detection radars, a Fort anti-air missile system, two OSA-M anti-aircraft missile systems, three systems of twin guns, a small anti-aircraft complex with a total of six guns and a 130mm universal artillery gun located on the bow of the ship.\n\n>\u201cFor some reason, none of that worked,\u201d said Neizhpapa. \u201cI think it\u2019s because of their overconfidence. The distance to the target was quite large, more than 100km from the coast. They didn\u2019t know that the Ukrainian navy had a Neptune missile system capable of doing that. They also didn\u2019t know that we could track them at that distance. In both cases they were wrong.\n\n>\u201cThis huge Russian navy thought it was fighting against a Ukrainian navy which doesn\u2019t even exist. I believe they did not see the naval forces of Ukraine as a threat at all.\u201d\n\n>The victory at Snake Island, which straddles sea routes into Odesa and the Dnipro River, allowed Ukraine to negotiate the UN-brokered grain deal with Russia, the vice-admiral said. The Kremlin\u2019s decision to seize Snake Island and maintain a garrison there had been another example of overconfidence, he argued.\n\n>\u201cIt could only be supplied by sea or air, so the navy group was assigned the task of disrupting these communications between Snake Island and occupied Crimea. The Harpoon missile system coped with this task very well.\n\n>\u201cRussian lost one supply vessel, three Raptor boats and one Serna-class landing craft. All of these boats were destroyed by the navy\u2019s Bayraktar UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles]. Directly on the island, we destroyed about five air defence systems, multiple rocket launchers and several pieces of equipment that they were unable to evacuate.\u201d\n\n>After winning back Snake Island, the navy now needs to drive the Russians from the Kinburn Spit to secure the mouth of the Dnipro and allow grain deliveries from the river port of Mykolaiv, Neizhpapa said.\n\n>\u201cThe Kinburn Spit is now under Russian control. There are artillery units there that are constantly shelling our shore in the area of Ochakiv and Pervomayskiy Island. The enemy has set up an airborne defence system on this spit. They are waiting for us to land there, so the entrance to the Dnipro-Bug Canal is now the contact line.\u201d\n\n>Depriving the enemy of the use of Crimea will be the ultimate test for Neizhpapa\u2019s navy.\n\n>\u201cThere are many people in Crimea who are waiting for us to come back. The main thing is that these operations are in process,\u201d he said with a knowing smile. \u201cI even know where.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve been saying for a long time that even if the Ukrainians took Crimea by land, holding it is not going to be worth the effort without a proper navy (even in \u2018peace\u2019 time), and it could be a pyrrhic victory for them. But, have also consistently underestimated the Ukrainian navy through this war, so who knows.",

The Ukrainians aren't trying to make the Russians quit by killing a large number of their soldiers to break their morale. They are trying to reduce the Russian ability to resist a counteroffensive by reducing the resources available to defend against that offensive. In particular, the reserves available to plug any holes in their lines after a Ukrainian penetration. Predicting whether the Russian losses will negatively impact their defense in the coming months is a much more immediate and tractable of a problem than predicting a morale collapse, and the answer is quite clearly yes, these offensives will reduce the Russian capacity for defense. Whether it will do so more than it will reduce the Ukrainian offensive capacity remains to be seen, but I addressed the issue in great detail in my post, and think that the Russians are burning through irreplaceable experienced troops while the Ukrainians sacrifice some of their lower quality troops that would not play a major role in any offensive anyway.\n\n>  It's impossible to know the future decisions that might undermine it, like Russian mobilization or how deep their well is in terms of manpower.

No one credible is claiming favorable loss ratios are the only reason Ukraine should defend Bakhmut. Really, no one credible thinks that loss ratio math alone can be used to evaluate real world combat effectively, which is how Duncan-M is trying to frame the argument he is arguing against. When the argument I and others have made takes into account the strategic and operational context around the loss ratios to explain why Ukraine may be choosing to fight for Bakhmut. Our claim is specifically that the Russians won't continue to sacrifice their troops at the same rate if the Ukrainians retreat, and that the total combat power of the UAF troops lost from the Russians continuing this offensive is less valuable to future Ukrainian efforts than the corresponding Russian loss in combat power. In my post, I explain that context in great detail by analyzing how the \"Soviet-influenced\" elements of the UAF are better suited to defensive trench warfare than for offensive maneuver warfare, and so their losses ultimately pose little threat to Ukrainian offensive power.",

The absence of a reasonable number of troops to fulfill all their military requirements is literally what it means to be short on manpower. The Russians are unable to achieve any significant offensive victories despite committing 300,000 newly mobilized troops. Even taking Bakhmut would be absurdly unimpressive on that scale. So obviously, clearly, inarguably, they do not have sufficient manpower. Just open your eyes and look at a map. The Russian objectives include complete domination of the entirety of Ukraine. Are the Russians controlling Kyiv? No. Ipso facto they do not have sufficient combat power to achieve their objectives.\n\nAnd a single division of [recently mobilized troops that received incredibly substandard training in Belarus with armor that barely qualifies as functional](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-ukraine-mod-belarus-war-combat-unit-1776832) is nowhere near sufficient for a theater of operation with hundreds of thousands of troops committed and an enemy reserve offensive force conservatively numbering in the tens of thousands of soldiers (not even counting any defensive reserves), even if the 2nd MRD is fully staffed to TOE standards as you assume. Which is unlikely, and in fact we have clear evidence to the contrary which I cited in my post, in that elements of the 2nd MRD have been committed to combat already. So the reserve certainly isn't the full division anymore, if it ever was.\n\n> Ukrainian troops in Bahkmut are at the point where if the Russians make one more breakthrough in Ivanivske or Khromove they will be surrounded in Bakhmut.\n\nThat won't matter unless the Russians can hold the positions they take to cut Ukrainian GLOCs and are able to prevent a Ukrainian retreat. Which they will only be able to do if the Ukrainians sit around doing nothing instead of committing their own largely unused reserves to push the Russians back. It seems unlikely that they would do so. Besides, every serious commentator I've seen is saying that the Russian offensive is culminating right now. \n\nTake the ISW daily update from yesterday,\n\n> Ukrainian and Western officials offered various views of the state of the Russian offensive in Bakhmut on March 25, but all are consistent with the assessment that the Russian effort around Bakhmut is likely culminating. The United Kingdom Ministry of Defense (MoD) assessed on March 25 that the Russian offensive against Bakhmut is stalling and that Russian forces may shift their focus to the Avdiivka and Svatove-Kreminna areas.[21] Ukrainian Eastern Group of Forces Spokesperson Colonel Serhiy Cherevaty cautioned that the recent decrease in reported Russian ground assaults near Bakhmut needs further analysis. Cherevaty also stated that unspecified Russian conventional forces are reinforcing Wagner Group forces, suggesting that Russian conventional forces are intervening to prevent the Wagner offensive from culminating prematurely.[22] Cherevaty noted that Russian forces conducted 18 ground attacks near Bakhmut on March 25 but recently conducted 40\u201350 attacks a day in the area, suggesting that exhausted Wagner forces are unable to sustain their prior tempo of operations alone but may increase their tempo to earlier levels with assistance from Russian conventional forces.[23] Ukrainian Armed Forces Commander in Chief General Valery Zaluzhny stated that the Bakhmut situation is stabilizing.[24] These statements are not mutually exclusive, however, and the Russian effort against Bakhmut is likely culminating. Russian forces may continue to attack Bakhmut frequently and aggressively even if the offensive has culminated with little to no success, as ISW has previously assessed, as culmination does not mean the absence of fighting.[25] Russian attacks in and around Bakhmut may resume at high levels without generating significant new gains if conventional Russian forces do, in fact, enter the fray. The commitment of conventional reserves could even prevent the attack from culminating and generate operationally significant advances or persuade Ukrainian forces to withdraw, although ISW regards those eventualities as unlikely at this time.\n\n> Russian forces do not have the degree of fire control over Ukrainian ground lines of communication (GLOCs) to Bakhmut, Avdiivka, and likely other areas of the front that Russian milbloggers claim, further undermining the Russian effort to take Bakhmut. Recent footage shows that Ukrainian forces remain able to drive on the Bakhmut-Chasiv Yar and Bakhmut-Khromove roads despite Russian artillery targeting the Ukrainian vehicles.[26] Russian milbloggers likely based their fire control claims on Russian artillery system ranges, but even Russian ground advances close to these GLOCs have failed to prevent Ukrainian vehicles from using them at least on a small scale. Geolocated footage posted on March 25 shows that Wagner Group forces have crossed the T0504 but remain unable to establish sustained positions that would cut the GLOC.[27]\n\nPerhaps their assessment isn't 100% accurate, but we are a long ways away from the UAF troop concentration in Bakhmut being cut off and compelled to surrender, and the Russians are clearly running out of steam.\n\n>  And then any calculations done about comparable losses will have to be thrown out the window.\n\nOk. Let's talk when that happens instead of just theorizing about something that is an extremely unlikely scenario which depends entirely on the Ukrainian military passively permitting a Russian encirclement and then refusing to fight their way out of that encirclement or to withdraw in advance of it.\n\n>  They are expending precious artillery/mortar ammunition that they are having to ration which makes fighting that much more difficult.\n\nSure, that's called economy of force. The Ukrainians are rationing the munitions they allocate to Bakhmut to preserve them for an offensive. In the end, it doesn't matter if they expend those resources in Bakhmut when doing so destroys more enemy forces than the same munitions would destroy when used in an offensive. That's just an efficient allocation of resources.\n\n>When you say \"no one serious\" that is excluding many serious people that have said it could compromise Ukraine's offensive because of how unfavorable it is. \n\nThat is a pretty extreme misrepresentation of my position, considering I specifically distinguished between the loss ratio being favorable versus the overall strategic situation being favorable. \n\n> Vulhedar is a perfect example of what is favorable. \n\nVuhledar was an unbelievably ridiculous and stupid offensive by the Russians. Each and every time they attempted it. Not every battle is so incredibly one-sided. Not by a long shot. Expecting that level of success in every battle sets an unrealistic standard to hold the Ukrainians to and overstates how one-sided a victory has to be for it to still benefit the Ukrainians. \n\n>  Ukrainians have a defendable position with flanks/supply lines secure and heavily mined approaches.\n\nAnd here you ignore one of the more important aspects of the argument I have repeatedly made and which Nielsen echoed. Bakhmut must be appear to be an appealing target for the Russians to continue their attacks there. If it were an unassailable fortress with no hope for victory, the Russians wouldn't thrown away so many of their valuable and irreplaceable reserves.",

The problem with IR is that while the missiles may have a long range, the tracker actually has a very short range. Maybe 10-15km? At least on the R-27. So any radar guided missile is going to out range the IR head, just because of the physics of the thing. \n\nThe result is you have a capability gap, in that 10-20km bracket you\u2019re looking at the sweet spot for an AAMRAM, at most altitudes and speeds 10km is a pretty hard MAR. It may go down to 7ish on the deck but not much shorter. Inside that range you\u2019re fucked no matter what. So if you put say an F-16 with AAMRAMs against a MIG-29 with -27 ERs (ETs? The naming always confuses me) the mig is going to struggle to develop a contact in IR mode while the 16 will be tossing hugely dangerous missiles. The thing with BVR, where all this really matters, is that first defensive is important. Not deterministic, but you always want to be going offensive while OPFOR is defensive. If you can do your acquire->fire->defensive loop so that you acquire a defensive foe, you\u2019re in a good position. That\u2019s easier to do with the better targeting parameters on the AAMRAM. \n\nWhere the medium range IR missile does well is in a complicated environment where surprise (NOT! Stealth) is possible. The R-27 was developed while the Soviets were moving from high interceptors to ambush dog fighters. The SU-27& MIG-29 were designed first and foremost to attack from unexpected positions with radars off. The SU-27 was designed specifically to kill F-15s by attacking from underneath. The goal was to already have missiles in the air and inside MAR by the time the F-15 pilots realized they were under attack. Because IR missiles don\u2019t trigger RWRs, it\u2019s the perfect ambush weapons. But western doctrine is quite the opposite, and all western aircraft ultimately prefer to fight high, fast, and long range where the AAMRAM is at its best. \n\nLast, the R-27 has been on the out as Russia switched over to its own active radar missile the R-77, updated versions of which may compete with the AIM-120C. The R-77 is a much more dangerous, modern missile. Likewise I\u2019m pretty sure (but would love to be proved wrong) that China has not introduced a new IR missile in the last 10-15 years, despite introducing a slate of new  active radar missiles that may even out compete the -120D. Part of this is the weird niche IR missiles sit in. Part of it is even greater improvements Re: disguising a fighters IR signature. Short range IR missiles get around this because of\u2026 well\u2026 the range. \n\nAs for the Tornado and SEAD, very likely it would do better than what Ukraine is doing. They\u2019re SEAD is very amateurish and limited strongly by technology. Any purpose built platform is going to beat Ukrainian duct tape tech. Importantly, being able to identify record and download radar plots which the Tornado *should* be able to do is huge. And the Brit\u2019s actually (theoretically) train for SEAD, where it seems that Russia only trained for DEAD, and Ukraine trained for neither.

If the idea is to fight high, fast and long range - is it just that at those engagement ranges the poorer acquisition range on an IR seeker makes them too unlikely to hit to be worth carrying over more AMRAAM? Particularly if the launching fighter is going to turn away before the IR seeker acquires and stop providing updates to the missile on where to fly? I guess if the Russian fighters are expecting (or trying) to fight at closer range that problem is ameliorated to some degree.\n\n> Last, the R-27 has been on the out as Russia switched over to its own active radar missile the R-77, updated versions of which may compete with the AIM-120C.

I suspect that this is going to be a topic of analysis for absolutely years from here on out. In theory I suppose the widespread deployment of F-35 and the new standoff weapons with good terminal guidance (meaning SPEAR-3, StormBreaker et al) ought to be able to mount an effective campaign...but then again Ukraine and Russia are both using a lot of older AA tech that the older SEAD kit was supposed to be able to handle, and if it just _can't_ then we probably have quite a few misplaced spending priorities.",

So any radar guided missile is going to out range the IR head, just because of the physics of the thing.</p>\n\n<p>The result is you have a capability gap, in that 10-20km bracket you\u2019re looking at the sweet spot for an AAMRAM, at most altitudes and speeds 10km is a pretty hard MAR. It may go down to 7ish on the deck but not much shorter. Inside that range you\u2019re fucked no matter what. So if you put say an F-16 with AAMRAMs against a MIG-29 with -27 ERs (ETs? The naming always confuses me) the mig is going to struggle to develop a contact in IR mode while the 16 will be tossing hugely dangerous missiles. The thing with BVR, where all this really matters, is that first defensive is important. Not deterministic, but you always want to be going offensive while OPFOR is defensive. If you can do your acquire-&gt;fire-&gt;defensive loop so that you acquire a defensive foe, you\u2019re in a good position. That\u2019s easier to do with the better targeting parameters on the AAMRAM. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>All this makes sense to me in a sort of &quot;why you wouldn&#39;t choose to fly solely with IR headed missiles&quot; context, but less in a &quot;why wouldn&#39;t I choose to fly with <em>both</em> context&quot;. If the idea is to fight high, fast and long range - is it just that at those engagement ranges the poorer acquisition range on an IR seeker makes them too unlikely to hit to be worth carrying over more AMRAAM? Particularly if the launching fighter is going to turn away before the IR seeker acquires and stop providing updates to the missile on where to fly? I guess if the Russian fighters are expecting (or trying) to fight at closer range that problem is ameliorated to some degree.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Last, the R-27 has been on the out as Russia switched over to its own active radar missile the R-77, updated versions of which may compete with the AIM-120C. The R-77 is a much more dangerous, modern missile. Likewise I\u2019m pretty sure (but would love to be proved wrong) that China has not introduced a new IR missile in the last 10-15 years, despite introducing a slate of new active radar missiles that may even out compete the -120D. Part of this is the weird niche IR missiles sit in. Part of it is even greater improvements Re: disguising a fighters IR signature. Short range IR missiles get around this because of\u2026 well\u2026 the range. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I wouldn&#39;t know about the Chinese missiles, but aren&#39;t there IR seeker variants of the R-77? I thought that I had read that. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>As for the Tornado and SEAD, very likely it would do better than what Ukraine is doing. They\u2019re SEAD is very amateurish and limited strongly by technology.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What&#39;re those limitations then? Stealth? But neither F-16 or the F/A-18 Growler fit that bill. Lack of suitably stand-off munitions? Jammers? What is it that they&#39;re missing.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>But the added wrinkle of this war is exactly why the air war has been so limited. Is it technology? Training? Weapons? Or are the S-300/400s and R-37s just that good. I havnt seen a Great answer. It may be that all non-stealth SEAD is just dead, thanks to the quality of enemy systems. With that lens it seems like the Tornado is just inadequate for the future battlefield. Certainly if I was advising the UK I would tell them not to spend another \u00a3 on non-stealth platforms. But on the flip side it may be that British pilots would have done this mission better. It\u2019s just hard to say. The thing we\u2019re seeing in Ukraine shouldn\u2019t happen, if you assume the UKR AF is equal to that of a western one. But it is, and the why is really important.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yeah. I suspect that this is going to be a topic of analysis for absolutely years from here on out. In theory I suppose the widespread deployment of F-35 and the new standoff weapons with good terminal guidance (meaning SPEAR-3, StormBreaker et al) ought to be able to mount an effective campaign...but then again Ukraine and Russia are both using a lot of older AA tech that the older SEAD kit was supposed to be able to handle, and if it just <em>can&#39;t</em> then we probably have quite a few misplaced spending priorities.</p>\n</div>",

They want to imply that DU is toxic and radioactive and therefore &quot;the west&quot; and &quot;nato&quot; is bad.</p>\n\n<p>The Russian strategy is not necessarily based on winning arguments, it&#39;s based on creating doubt and encouraging users to to think &quot;well they&#39;re all as bad as each other&quot;, which slowly has the effect of weakening support for the war.</p>\n\n<p>Russia of course has no such problems because of the ttalitarian nature of their government.</p>\n\n<p>Here is an article about just some of the Russia troll accounts Redit banned a while back.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2018/4/11/17224294/reddit-russia-internet-research-agency\">https://www.vox.com/world/2018/4/11/17224294/reddit-russia-internet-research-agency</a></p>\n\n<p>When scrolling through the accounts one theme became clear - they were taking both sides of all arguments and baiting the other in classic agent provocateur tactics.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m sorry for you and everyone else that you are so ignorant about this topic.
