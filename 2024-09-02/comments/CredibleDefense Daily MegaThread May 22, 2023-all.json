The new security chief is IRGC General Ali Akbar Ahmadian, credited with being one of the masterminds of Iran's assymetrical warfare doctrine.\n\n[Iran\u2019s president appoints new official in powerful security post, replacing longtime incumbent](https://apnews.com/article/iran-supreme-national-security-council-shamkhani-892b335e8492782b19b28a92e066db7f)\r  \n\n>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 Iran\u2019s president on Monday appointed a new official to take over the post of secretary of the country\u2019s Supreme National Security Council, replacing the longtime powerful official Ali Shamkhani after becoming implicated in a recent spy scandal.\r  \n\r  \n>President Ebrahim Raisi issued a decree replacing Shamkhani who has faced persistent corruption allegations \u2014 which he denied \u2014 as well as scrutiny because of close ties with a British-Iranian man hanged on spying charges earlier this year in Iran.\r  \n\r  \n>Shamkhani was a key player in negotiations with the West over Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. He was also in office during the years of tensions that followed then-President Donald Trump\u2019s 2018 decision to unilaterally withdraw America from the accord.\r  \n\r  \n>The decree, reported by the state-run IRNA news agency, offered no explanation for the change. In a message on Twitter on Sunday night, as rumors about his position circulated, Shamkhani cryptically posted a verse by the 14th century Persian poet Mohtasham Kashani.\n\nA [profile](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2012/08/the-irgc-strategic-brain-trust-part-2-ahmadian-hejazi-and-jafari.html) of Ahmadian dating back to 2012:  \n\n>While other senior officers such as Soleimani, Vahidi, and Jafari have been the focus of attention in the West, one of Iran's most talented military strategists is the relatively unknown Rear Admiral Ali Akbar Ahmadian. He was born in 1961 in the town of Babak in Kerman province. An outstanding student, he graduated from high school in Kerman and was admitted to the University of Tehran's medical school in 1979. When the Iran-Iraq War broke out the following September, he left the university and joined the Guards and the Basij militia. After his training, he fought at the front in Khuzestan province.  \n\r  \n>In 1981, a leftist guerrilla group led by Ashraf Dehghani -- a key member of the communist guerrillas who fought the regime of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi -- began to attack government buildings in Bandar Abbas, Iran's main port during the war. Ahmadian and two other Guard officers were dispatched to Bandar Abbas, where they led a successful effort against Dehghani's group. In March 1982, the Iranian Army and the Guards launched the Fath ol-Mobin operation in Khuzestan. Ahmadian took part in the operation, which liberated almost 1,000 square miles that had been occupied by Iraqi forces and essentially eliminated the possibility that Iraq could again attack the strategic towns of Dezful, Shush (Susa), and Andimeshk. After the operation, Guard chief Mohsen Rezaei made Ahmadian a member of the corps' command council and put him in charge of coordinating Guard forces in the provinces of Hormozgan, Kerman, and Sistan and Baluchistan. He was subsequently promoted to chief of staff of the Guard forces in the southeast. The forces under his command took part in several important operations against Iraq.\r  \n\r  \n>In 1984, the Guards created five military districts around Iran; Ahmadian was appointed commander of District 4 and the Nooh (Noah) base in Bandar Abbas. The vast district included the provinces of Fars, Bushehr, Kerman, Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad, Hormozgan, and Yazd. The next year, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ordered the Guards to form their own naval and air force wings, and Ahmadian was put in charge of the Guards' maritime forces. After the war ended in July 1988, he was commissioned as a naval officer and appointed deputy chief of the Iranian Navy, then under the command of Rear Admiral Ali Shamkhani. He also returned to the University of Tehran and graduated as a dentist (he is often accorded the salutation Rear Admiral Dr.). He also received an M.S. in defense sciences from the National Defense University.\r  \n\r  \n>In July 2000, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei appointed Ahmadian chief of staff of the Guards' forces (a position just below that of the Guards' top commander), replacing Brigadier General Hossein Alaei, a popular war hero. (In an article published this January, Alaei implicitly compared Khamenei to the Shah and the present state of affairs to the era immediately before the 1979 Revolution. He was criticized by some hardline Guard officers, including Mohammad Hejazi, and later claimed that his article had been misinterpreted.) Ahmadian was credited as chief of staff with modernizing the Guards' organization and streamlining its operations. For two years, he was also the commander of Imam Hossein University, a Guard-controlled institution that instills ideological \"purity\" in the Guards' officer corps. After Jafari was appointed Guard chief in September 2007, Khamenei named Ahmadian to head the Guards' Strategic Center, a post he still holds.\r  \n\r  \n>Ahmadian is credited as one of the very first senior officers to institutionalize the strategy of asymmetric warfare in Iran's military doctrine. It was under his command that the Guards' navy developed its asymmetric warfare strategy to counter the Bahrain-based U.S. Fifth Fleet. Lessons were learned when the U.S. Navy, together with NATO forces, intervened in the Iran-Iraq War, saying it was protecting Arab nations' oil tankers in the Persian Gulf. They destroyed roughly one quarter of Iran's large warships in just one day, April 18, 1988. The Guards' naval command consequently decided to rely on fast \"swarming\" boats, of which it now has over 1,500, and land-based missiles on the shores of the Persian Gulf. The effectiveness of Iran's asymmetric warfare strategy has already been amply demonstrated in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and particularly in the conflict between Israel and the Lebanese Hezbollah in summer 2006. Indeed, the June 28 Pentagon report referenced in part 1 states, \"Iran's unconventional forces are trained according to its asymmetric warfare doctrine and would present a formidable force while defending Iranian territory.\"\r  \n\r  \n>Like Soleimani, Ahmadian does not often speak publicly. But he is known to be a hardliner who believes that the Guards are justified in intervening in all aspects of national affairs to \"protect the Revolution.\" He has stated this many times, most recently on July 17. He has also said that while the threat of what he calls \"soft power\" has been recognized by the Islamic Republic's leadership, not much attention has been paid to what he calls the \"soft threat\" -- presumably that of Western culture and, more generally, the Internet and social media networks. A collection of some of the many lectures he has given on the subject has been published.",

Didn't see it in the article.\n\nBut thanks for sharing the article, it was well written and quite visceral, if not entirely what this sub is made for. A few small notes on the content of the article:\n\n1. Other than assault actions, the infantry combat is very similar to what it has been in positional fighting ever since the Crimean war. Everything just happens on a much smaller scale, due to the increased dispersion of forces that becomes necessary with the increased lethality of fires. Good communication, even the obviously ad-hoc channels used in the article (Signal and other messenger services) can keep the units cohesive, but it seems to have become a much more private war.\n2. Casualty rates in the combat arms are just as vicious as ever. I wonder how many new faces a maintenance platoon sees going to the trenches each month, while they remain mostly the same old crew.

A few small notes on the content of the article:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Other than assault actions, the infantry combat is very similar to what it has been in positional fighting ever since the Crimean war. Everything just happens on a much smaller scale, due to the increased dispersion of forces that becomes necessary with the increased lethality of fires. Good communication, even the obviously ad-hoc channels used in the article (Signal and other messenger services) can keep the units cohesive, but it seems to have become a much more private war.</li>\n<li>Casualty rates in the combat arms are just as vicious as ever. I wonder how many new faces a maintenance platoon sees going to the trenches each month, while they remain mostly the same old crew.

He added that Biden \u201cmade clear that we are not planning to lift any sanctions on him or on China more broadly.\u201d\n\n>Asked on Sunday whether the US would lift sanctions on Li so he could meet Austin, Biden said: \u201cThat\u2019s under negotiation right now.\u201d\n\n> More broadly, Biden voiced optimism that US-China relations would \u201cbegin to thaw very shortly\u201d after the shooting down of an alleged Chinese spy balloon thwarted positive momentum stemming from a meeting between the US president and Chinese leader Xi Jinping last year. Tensions remain high on a number of fronts, with China accusing the US of seeking to contain its rise by restricting access to advanced technology and supporting Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its territory. \n\n> Despite the heated rhetoric, the White House has started engaging with China on multiple fronts of late.\n\n>US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan met China\u2019s top diplomat Wang Yi in Vienna earlier this month, and China\u2019s Commerce minister Wang Wentao is set to meet this week with both US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo in Washington and US Trade Representative Katherine Tai in Detroit.",

So at this point, any further escalation increases the risk of conflict.\u201d  \n  \n>The new project is being constructed next to Natanz, about 225 kilometers (140 miles) south of Tehran. Natanz has been a point of international concern since its existence became known two decades ago.\r  \n\r  \n>Protected by anti-aircraft batteries, fencing and Iran\u2019s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, the facility sprawls across 2.7 square kilometers (1 square mile) in the country\u2019s arid Central Plateau.  \n\n>Satellite photos taken in April by Planet Labs PBC and analyzed by the AP show Iran burrowing into the K\u016bh-e Kolang Gaz L\u0101, or \u201cPickaxe Mountain,\u201d which is just beyond Natanz\u2019s southern fencing.\r  \n\r  \n>A different set of images analyzed by the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies reveals that four entrances have been dug into the mountainside, two to the east and another two to the west.

Based on the size of the spoil piles and other satellite data, experts at the center told AP that Iran is likely building a facility at a depth of between 80 meters (260 feet) and 100 meters (328 feet). The center\u2019s analysis, which it provided exclusively to AP, is the first to estimate the tunnel system\u2019s depth based on satellite imagery.\r  \n\r  \n>The Institute for Science and International Security, a Washington-based nonprofit long focused on Iran\u2019s nuclear program, suggested last year the tunnels could go even deeper.\r  \n\r  \n>Experts say the size of the construction project indicates Iran likely would be able to use the underground facility to enrich uranium as well \u2014 not just to build centrifuges. Those tube-shaped centrifuges, arranged in large cascades of dozens of machines, rapidly spin uranium gas to enrich it. Additional cascades spinning would allow Iran to quickly enrich uranium under the mountain\u2019s protection.  \n\n>\u201cSo the depth of the facility is a concern because it would be much harder for us. It would be much harder to destroy using conventional weapons, such as like a typical bunker buster bomb,\u201d said Steven De La Fuente, a research associate at the center who led the analysis of the tunnel work.\r  \n\r  \n>The new Natanz facility is likely to be even deeper underground than Iran\u2019s Fordo facility, another enrichment site that was exposed in 2009 by U.S. and other world leaders. That facility sparked fears in the West that Iran was hardening its program from airstrikes.\r  \n\r  \n>Such underground facilities led the U.S. to create the GBU-57 bomb, which can plow through at least 60 meters (200 feet) of earth before detonating, according to the American military. U.S. officials reportedly have discussed using two such bombs in succession to ensure a site is destroyed. It is not clear that such a one-two punch would damage a facility as deep as the one at Natanz.\r  \n\r  \n>With such bombs potentially off the table, the U.S. and its allies are left with fewer options to target the site. If diplomacy fails, sabotage attacks may resume.\r  \n\r  \n>Already, Natanz has been targeted by the Stuxnet virus, believed to be an Israeli and American creation, which destroyed Iranian centrifuges. Israel also is believed to have killed scientists involved in the program, struck facilities with bomb-carrying drones and launched other attacks. Israel\u2019s government declined to comment.\r  \n\r  \n>Experts say such disruptive actions may push Tehran even closer to the bomb \u2014 and put its program even deeper into the mountain where airstrikes, further sabotage and spies may not be able to reach it.\r  \n\r  \n>\u201cSabotage may roll back Iran\u2019s nuclear program in the short-term, but it is not a viable, long-term strategy for guarding against a nuclear-armed Iran,\u201d said Davenport, the nonproliferation expert. \u201cDriving Iran\u2019s nuclear program further underground increases the proliferation risk.\u201d\n\n[https://apnews.com/article/iran-nuclear-natanz-uranium-enrichment-underground-project-04dae673fc937af04e62b65dd78db2e0](https://apnews.com/article/iran-nuclear-natanz-uranium-enrichment-underground-project-04dae673fc937af04e62b65dd78db2e0)",

The struggles among the elites are rarely visible (Prigozhin is a rare exception) until the decisive moment. Personalist autocracies can fail a lot, and I mean a lot, and yet keep the regime stable. See Venezuela as the most prominent example, but also Syria, Belarus, Saddam's regime, and, arguably, Turkey. \n\nThere is a relatively simple recipe for keeping your personalist autocratic leadership stable: pay your police and elites a lot, pay the poorest people a little for basic popular suppor, leverage market economy to avoid catastrophic food shortages, only promote the most loyal unambitious idiots, keep your borders open, so that the people who don't like you simply leave, and, if possible, receive help from more successful autocrats. As long as you keep to these rules, you are mostly invincible. Add some propaganda and random repressions to the mix, and you may even enjoy high ratings.\n\nOn the other hand, autocracies are very stable until they are not. When a significant part of the elites feel that they don't need you anymore, you better be ready to leave. That moment may come without any warning.\n\nOverall, autocracies can survive a lot, even losing wars, without major problems.

It&#39;s going to happen quite slowly, but in 20 years, following current trend lines, who knows who&#39;ll be the technological leaders of the world?  </p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: totalitarian regimes with leaders who serve for life (very possibly the way it&#39;s going to go after Xi Jinping&#39;s precedent) are extremely susceptible to long-term disaster if that leader happens to do a bad job... but to gamble that they&#39;ll collapse instead improving ourselves seems a stupid strategy.</p>\n</div>",
