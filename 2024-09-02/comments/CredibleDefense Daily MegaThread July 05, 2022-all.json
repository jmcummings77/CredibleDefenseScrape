Russia *still* refuses to implement even the most basic wartime measures, like refusing to allow soldiers to quit before their contract is up. Yup, if you\u2019re a Russian private you can just up and leave at any time. They can yell and scream and not pay your combat bonus, but they have to let you go eventually.

The lack of payment to arms manufacturers is unconfirmed at this point, although if it isn't true it begs the question of why the Russian government would need to compel them to take military purchase orders.\n\nI also suspect Russia isn't asking them to work without any form of payment whatsoever. The problem is inflation. Although they've managed to avoid Wiemar style hyperinflation so far, [even the Russian central bank says inflation will average 14% this year](https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/russias-inflation-may-be-close-14-2022-central-bank-head-says-2022-06-16/).

There are anecdotal reports inflation may be reaching up to 25%.   \n\nFor any company to stay profitable in that environment it will need to either increase prices, write into the contract that the final price is tied to inflation, or demand payment in advance. None of those options sound acceptable to the Russian government, so it's choosing instead to force arms manufactures to accept a loss at current or even pre-war prices for their products. That can continue on for a time, especially if they make the central bank loan them money, but eventually that painful bill is going to come due.\n\nThe III Corps isn't just a rumor reported by CIT, a [Ukrainian military commander confirmed it](https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-ato/3512525-russia-keeps-amassing-troops-at-ukraine-border-forms-3rd-army-corps.html).

If and when Russia decides to start conscripting Crimeans it will be near impossible to hide though.\n\nAnd just to head off an expected response, yes I'm aware this is mostly coming from Ukrainian sources. Bit of the nature of the beast, the Russians are loath to admit any problems so we're forced to rely on the Ukrainians for anything but the most basic analysis, which is a problem because they sometimes put out propaganda.

China probably believes they are stuck in the middle income trap if they can\u2019t achieve something like that at least somewhat. </p>\n\n<p>That\u2019s probably desirable for their people, but probably also more of a pie splitting approach that will come at the expense of the US which thinks a rules based globalist environment is favorable, and also depends upon a particular innovation ecosystem around IP ownership and original ip and innovation development being a major source of competitiveness. China does innovate with a different system but it\u2019s usually more oriented to extremely effective recombining of ideas to fit customer/business need in context without ip friction. </p>\n\n<p>Russian aggression as a long term destabilizer to that system is minor in comparison, as China would like to change a lot of the world economy to benefit their strengths and goals.</p>\n</div>",

Taken together, the moves will greatly enhance NATO\u2019s firepower and strengthen its ability to deter Russian aggression. They also could create new risks, which all member states will need to be attentive to.\n\nThe summit\u2019s most significant breakthrough came before it officially began, when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed to support the Nordic countries\u2019 bids to join NATO. In exchange, Erdogan received assurances that both countries would not support Kurdish groups that Turkey considers terrorists \u2014 as well as a pledge from US President Joe Biden to support the sale of new F-16 fighter jets to Turkey.\n\nHowever distasteful to give in to Erdogan\u2019s demands, the price was worth it. Adding Finland and Sweden will significantly upgrade the alliance\u2019s air-defense and intelligence capabilities and help NATO counter Russian activity in the Baltic Sea and the Arctic. It also sends a powerful message to Russian President Vladimir Putin: namely, that his attempt to use the invasion of Ukraine to weaken and divide NATO has done just the opposite.\n\nHaving agreed to move forward with Nordic expansion, the leaders of NATO\u2019s member states will still need to convince their respective legislatures to ratify the deal. In the meantime, the allies should increase intelligence sharing and defense cooperation with Finland and Sweden to deter Russia from taking hostile action while their membership bids are pending.\n\nBeyond expanding to the north, NATO announced other measures that have the potential to transform Europe\u2019s security landscape. Biden said the US will establish a permanent Army headquarters in Poland and rotate more forces to Romania and the Baltic states. Two additional squadrons of US F-35 stealth fighters will be sent to the UK to bolster NATO\u2019s air power. Fully deploying the new assets will double the size of NATO\u2019s defenses on its eastern flank.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the allies can sustain the resolve that was on display in Madrid. US and European officials predict the war in Ukraine is likely to continue for months to come. Support for tougher sanctions against Russia may collapse as energy and food costs mount. It\u2019s also possible that Putin will lash out in retaliation against NATO\u2019s new assertiveness, perhaps by targeting vulnerable Baltic states \u2014 which might test the willingness of the US and Europe to heed their obligations to defend any ally that comes under attack.\n\nThe work of defending Ukraine\u2019s freedom, let alone countering Russian influence in Europe, is far from over. But NATO has so far shown impressive unity and determination in meeting the challenge. For that, Biden and his fellow leaders deserve credit and support",

That\u2019s not even getting into loss of manufacturing capability in 1943 and 1944 </li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In my mind, those losses are far more important than lend-lease was a benefit. They devastated any German potential for successful strategic offensive operations by 1943. However, if you remove both those operations and lend-lease, the USSR situation in 42 and 43 is extremely dire</p>\n</div>",

Germany invaded the USSR with faulty assumptions, and despite its operationally significant victories of June - July 1941, the balance of forces was steadily moving toward the Soviets during the first summer of the war. What saved the Germans from incipient disaster was the rapid succession of encirclements during the early fall, namely [Kiev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kiev_(1941)), the [Sea of Azov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Sea_of_Azov), [Bryansk](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppelschlacht_bei_Wjasma_und_Brjansk#Kessel_von_Brjansk) and finally the largest of all, [Vyazma](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppelschlacht_bei_Wjasma_und_Brjansk#Kessel_von_Wjasma).\n\nThis gave the Germans a second wind which was then lost to a combination of mud, overextended logistics, and attrition. By early December the initiative had swung back in favor of the Soviets, and the latter initiated, first, a relatively narrow Moscow counteroffensive, and then in early January a general, broad-front counteroffensive.\n\nThis winter counteroffensive, after gaining some ground in January, bogged down and frittered away manpower and materiel in a futile attempt to win the war right then and there. Casualty ratios during the first quarter of 1942 were so lopsided in favor of the defending Germans - 1,606,376 Soviet vs 279,534 German KIA/WIA/MIA - that the manpower and materiel balance actually **improved** in favor of the Wehrmacht, despite larger Soviet force generation.\n\nBy May 1942, the initiative was back in German hands, and the latter made good use of it: in a series of localized blows and counterblows they destroyed Soviet force concentrations in the [Kerch Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Kerch_Peninsula#Operation_Bustard_Hunt,_8_May_%E2%80%93_19_May), around [Kharkov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Battle_of_Kharkov), at the [Volkhov bridgehead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2nd_Shock_Army#Military_history), in [Sevastopol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Sevastopol_(1941%E2%80%931942)#Second_Axis_offensive) and around [Bely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battles_of_Rzhev#Operation_Seydlitz). On June 28, they launched their strategic summer offensive, *Blau*, and, contrary to the oft-repeated legend that the Soviets deliberately avoided encirclement, the Red Army lost 326,491 PoW just to Army Groups A and B during July.\n\nWhat saved the Soviets from disaster was the poor decision-making of the Germans, not unlike how their own poor decision-making had thrown a lifeline to the Wehrmacht earlier in the war: beyond its first weeks, *Blau* degenerated in a misbegotten rush to achieve unrealistic territorial objectives at the cost of focusing on the destruction of the Red Army, which is what the Germans had done successfully over the prior 3 months.\n\nUnlike in 1941, in mid-1942 the USSR no longer had the untapped reserves of manpower to make good the kind of losses it suffered in May - July 1942: \\~1 million PoW and over half-a-million KIA, DoW and permanently disabled. Indeed, between early May and early October 1942, the total manpower of the Red Army and Navy fell from 11,469,000 to 10,620,000.\n\nThe failure of the Germans to press their advantage over the full course of the summer, the overextension of Army Groups A and B, and the relative lull in the fighting that occurred in October and the first 18 days of November, coupled with the deployment of Axis minor armies lacking in mobility and AT capabilities on the wings of the German effort at Stalingrad, allowed the Soviets to recuperate during the fall and set up ideal conditions for the successful and devastating Soviet counteroffensive, *Uran*. Note that in areas where such ideal conditions were absent - Army Groups North and Center - the Soviet winter offensives were, not unlike those of early 1942, costly failures.\n\nGerman and Axis losses on the southern wing, however, combined with growing Anglo-American involvement starting with the *Torch* landings of November 8, were sufficient to decisively swing the balance in favor of the Soviets.\n\n>For some reason a country with enormous population under ita control and the industrial base probably bigger than the Soviet could not outproduce them.\n\nWell, there's no great mystery: prior to [early 1942](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Sauckel#General_Plenipotentiary_for_Labour_Deployment) the mobilization of the European labor force by Germany occurred in an ad hoc, ineffective manner, whereas the lion's share of Germany's prime industrial manpower served in the Wehrmacht.

In 1941, the USSR was in the process of general mobilization, with the lion's share of its manpower pool still available - not unlike the situation Germany was in back in late 1939. This was no longer the case in 1942.\n\nThus, the USSR mobilized for military service:\n\n\\-06/22/1941 - 04/30/1942: 15,384,837 men / 313 days = 49,153 per day  \n\\-05/01/1942 - 12/31/1942: 5,328,392 men / 245 days = 21,749 per day  \n\\-01/01/1943 - 12/31/1943: 5,901,436 men / 365 days = 16,168 per day  \n\\-01/01/1944 - 12/31/1944: 4,646,250 men / 366 days = 12,695 per day  \n\\-01/01/1945 - 04/30/1945: 551,243 men / 120 days = 4,594 per day\n\nSource: [*https://liewar*](https://liewar)*,ru/dokumenty/231-velikaya-otechestvennaya-bez-grifa-sekretnosti-kniga-poter.html?start=2* (replace , with .)\n\n>The USSR could have dropped from 11.5 million to 10 million, or even 9 million, but they still had significant manpower reserves - **as confirmed by the fact that they managed to make up the enormous losses suffered until 1945.** So the 1942 manpower bankruptcy would have also been a temporary one.\n\nAlthough it's true that the Red Army replenished its losses until the end of the war - with total strength barely moving from 11,218,122 on 05/01/1942 to 11,365,001 on 05/01/1945 - the means by which it did so differed in its second half.\n\nIn effect, in 1941 and 1942 the Red Army primarily mobilized manpower through regular, centralized call-ups, whereas from 1943 to 1945 it did so primarily by conscripting men from the liberated territories in a somewhat ad hoc manner.\n\nThus, between 11/19/1942 and the end of the war, the Red Army liberated Soviet territories with a 1939 population of [79,972,000](http://www.teatrskazka.com/Raznoe/StatSbornikVOV/StSbVOV01.html#t8). Per my [own estimate](https://forum.axishistory.com/viewtopic.php?p=2377559#p2377559), between 01/01/1943 and 05/01/1945 the USSR provided the Red Army and Navy with a net manpower intake of 9,207,729 personnel: 3,878,126 (42%) came from territories it initially controlled, whereas **5,329,603 (58%) came from liberated territories**.\n\nTo put things in perspective, at the level the Soviets were losing manpower **permanently** in the May - July 1942 period (\\~1.5 million POW/KIA/DOW/crippled), an influx of 3,878,126 men would have covered slightly less than 8 months of losses. But of course the Soviets couldn't have simply mobilized all those men at once, and therefore the Red Army could have been expected to shrink... Which is, in fact, exactly what we observe during that period.\n\n>I just think that a society like the Soviet one was extremely difficult to defeat. (...).  \n>  \n>It seems that the only way to defeat such a society is by depriving it of the means of resistance - either by inflicting casualties that exceed the total replacement pool, or by seizing the production and transportation hubs.\n\nHere I agree with you - the war was only ever going to end with the Soviets in Berlin or with the Germans at the Urals, along with the Japanese in Vladivostok. I would argue, however, that casualty infliction/assets capture are not an either/or proposition, but rather compounding effects: casualties exceeding Soviet replacements would have shrunk the Red Army, therefore facilitating further offensives that would continue shrinking the Red Army **and** capture territory holding production and transportation hubs, as well as population centers.\n\nIn effect, in 1942 the situation stood on a knife's edge: either German success would become self-sustaining in the aforementioned manner, or Soviet success would become self-sustaining the other way around - i.e., through the liberation of territory and population. The latter thankfully happened, but it shouldn't obscure how precarious the situation really was.\n\n>The German army was capable of instances of operational advances 200-400km in depth of enemy territory that were almost impossible to resist. Most European countries could not survive a single such attack. France took two. In Russia the Germans managed to pull off... what, three in 1941 and two in 1942? But that was the end of their logistical and production tether.\n\nI would argue that the Germans didn't need 200 - 400 km advances in 1942, at least not all at once, and not all in the same direction. What the Germans needed was to destroy Soviet force concentrations and capture additional territory and population centers *without overextending*. As such, the advance toward the Volga and into the Caucasus was by far the worst strategic direction into which they could pour their (relatively limited) offensive assets.\n\n>Regarding the WW1 Germany, yes, in the beginning nobody knew what to do. But later **the Hindenburg programme was actually quite efficient and managed to maximise war production** under very difficult circumstances\n\nThis is true, but then so too did Germany in 1942 - 1945.\n\nIn effect, I would argue that Germany's war-industrial effort during WW2 can be separated into three phases:\n\n1. September 1939 - June 1940: Focus on a rapid increase of output - especially ammunition - to fight the French and the British in Western Europe\n2. July 1940 - November 1941: Focus on expanding the total size of the ground forces, a limited expansion of production for a select range of ground forces materiel, and preparations for the demobilization of parts of said ground forces, post-*Barbarossa*, to man the factories needed to fight a war of industrial production focused primarily on air and naval platforms\n3. December 1941 - end of the war: An all-out industrial effort, made possible by the use of slave labor, to maximize immediate production across all categories of armaments and munitions",

It seems like some systems, such as the Krasukha have jamming ranges over 100 miles, though I'd imagine that their effectiveness declines as distance increases. I'd also be interested to learn more about NATO tools and doctrine for countering these kinds of EW threats. I imagine that EW assets are relatively easy to locate when they're active, and it's just a manner of burning through the jamming to put a PGM on target, but I wouldn't be surprised if there's a lot more to it.",

I will cover some of Dugin's proposals, feel free to discuss others or respond to these takes. Personally I skimmed the book back in 2014, and more recently read John Dunlop's summary to refresh.\n\nAs far as I can tell, 90s Dugin is representative of the overall direction/attitude where the Russian \"blob\" went at the end of the 90s (paranoia of USA, small traces of pan-Slavic mythicism, downplaying and likely underestimating Western European integration, subduing the near abroad), but most of the specific proposals went nowhere. Maybe the most important difference is, in contrast to Dugin's \"never ever trust China\" advice, Putin established close relations with Xi and has been getting rid of the Russian China paranoia.\n\nOn the other hand, Dugin's advice to attempt to sever the UK from Europe was definitely followed. Not that it matters *that* much in practice, as (in geopolitically relevant ways) UK has managed to overcome the trade disputes by increasing its role as a contributor to European security, and after February 24, likely won't do what Russia wants it to do for a long long time. The most significant effect, really, is that UK's and EU's economies took minor hits.\n\nDugin proposed a \"Moscow-Berlin axis\" to let Germany dominate Western/central European politics. There are *some* traces of this with the way Russia has almost always used more polite language with EU authorities compared to USA/UK, and Putin himself didn't even oppose Ukraine's EU candidacy when it was granted. Perhaps Moscow-Brussels axis would be a more apt designation. But I still might hesitate to consider this a proactive policy in the way Dugin proposed. This could be more of a risk management decision: as EU's ever closer foreign policy cooperation has made it much more dangerous to Russia, it is worthwhile to put at least the minimum effort (diplomatic conduct with a target audience of the few most dovish power players in the EU) to avoid a total breakdown in relations.\n\nMiddle-Eastern policy was to be solved by another axis with Tehran, which Dugin thought could dominate the Middle East (and that Russia could understand culturally as a fellow conservative Eurasian civilization). Russia has indeed maintained decent ties with Iran. Alas, while Iran has considerable influence in post-war Iraq and runs a lot of militants around the Middle East, due to its competitors it looks less like a winning horse than it did in the 90s. Israel and the Arab states have joined forces and entered a cold war against Tehran (with the last power center Turkey being neutral-ish in this respect but definitely closer to Israel/Arabs). I think this proposal was decent in the 90s, but would have required a much much deeper and earlier investment to get Iran on the path to dominate the region. Probably too late to pull this off anymore.\n\nProbably the most galaxy-brained take in Foundations of Geopolitics, though, was the \"Moscow-Tokyo axis\". Basically, because nuclear bombs, Japan is secretly super resentful of USA, and they would obviously much rather ally with Russia. And this would help contain both USA and China in the Pacific. I don't know how Dugin thought this could ever work out. Would have been interesting to see Moscow attempt this, but alas, they were not complete idiots.",
