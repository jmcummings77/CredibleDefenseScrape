Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

        "body": "There are a couple more bits of reporting today that Iran is seeking to de-escalate tensions with the U.S. and vice versa. The first, from the [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/01/world/middleeast/iran-us-war.html):\n\n>Iran\u2019s Supreme National Security Council held an emergency meeting this week, deeply worried that the United States would retaliate after an Iran-aligned militia in Iraq killed three American soldiers and wounded more than 40 others in Jordan.\n\n>The council, including the president, foreign minister, chiefs of the armed forces and two aides to the country\u2019s supreme leader, debated how to respond to a range of possibilities, from a U.S. attack on Iran, itself, to strikes against the proxy militias that Iran backs in the region, according to three Iranians with knowledge of the council\u2019s deliberations who were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\n>They relayed the plans developed at the Monday meeting to the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the people familiar with the discussion said, and he responded with clear orders: avoid a direct war with the United States and distance Iran from the actions of proxies who had killed Americans \u2014 but prepare to hit back if the United States struck Iran.\n\n>For a repressive, widely unpopular government already struggling with a weak economy, outbursts of mass protest and terrorism, direct conflict with the United States risks not only death and destruction in Iran. It could threaten the theocratic regime\u2019s grip on power.\n\n>Iran\u2019s relationship with its proxies was designed to afford it plausible deniability. Though Iran leads an overall strategy, the extent to which these groups coordinate their actions and take orders from Iran varies widely: Hezbollah is the closest ally; the Iraqi militias have somewhat more autonomy; and the Houthis are an unpredictable wild card, according to analysts and the Iranians interviewed.\n\n>But a war directly involving Iran and the United States has seemed just a misstep away, and that misstep may have arrived when Iraqi militants aligned with Iran conducted the lethal drone attack on U.S. troops in Jordan last Sunday. After more than 100 such attacks on U.S. bases since Oct. 7, it was the first to kill Americans.\n\n>Now Iran is trying to head off that direct war. After a visit from Gen. Ismail Ghaani, commander of the Quds Forces, Kata\u2019ib Hezbollah, a militia that the Pentagon said was likely responsible for the drone attack, issued a statement on Tuesday saying that it would suspend attacks on U.S. forces, that Iran was not involved in its decision-making, and that in fact sometimes Iran disapproved of its attacks on Americans.\n\n>And three years after sidelining a former foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, Mr. Khamenei\u2019s circle once again began consulting him regularly. Mr. Zarif, considered a moderate, is well known to American officials.\n\n>\u201cThey called on Mr. Zarif because he can better analyze the situation for them and explain it to an audience and in this sensitive time they need top foreign policy experts,\u201d said Sassan Karimi, a political analyst in Tehran who co-teaches a university class with Mr. Zarif. \u201cThe goal is to navigate this serious crisis with every tool and in a manner that results in America not attacking Iran.\u201d\n\n>Mr. Khameini has told those close to him that he opposes war with the United States because preserving the Islamic regime\u2019s hold on power is the highest priority, and war would divert the world\u2019s attention from the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, according to a person affiliated with his circle and a military strategist with ties to the Revolutionary Guards.\n\n>War could also have disastrous consequences domestically for ordinary people, and Iran is already plagued by international sanctions, unemployment and corruption. Many Iranians do not want war, fearing it would worsen things. Over the past two decades, they have seen U.S.-led invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, and the civil war in Syria, sow chaos and chronic instability.\n\n>For a government that has repeatedly resorted to violence to crush popular challenges to its rule, conflict risks more internal turmoil. There is dissension even among religious conservatives, and worry that the country\u2019s troubles are insurmountable.\n\n>\u201cThere is not even a glimmer of hope for things improving in the Islamic Republic,\u201d wrote Mehdi Nassiri, a conservative cleric who has broken with the government and turned into a vocal critic, on social media. \u201cToday is better than tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\nThe [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/shadow-war-with-iran-risks-turning-into-a-direct-conflict-6b8eddd9?mod=newsviewer_click) has more details about U.S. strike plans:\n\n>Biden has approved plans for multiday strikes in Iraq and Syria against multiple targets, including Iranian personnel and facilities, according to U.S. officials. But the response, expected to begin as soon as this weekend, will be \u201ctiered,\u201d mixing military actions with other steps that can be adjusted to signal that Washington doesn\u2019t seek further escalation.\n\n>The goal, U.S. officials say, is to get Iran and its proxies to dial back their attacks across the region as the White House and its allies pursue talks on a cease-fire between Hamas and Israel that they hope will de-escalate tensions.\n\n>By signaling its intention well in advance of any strikes, the White House may give Iran time to reposition personnel and equipment, limiting the effectiveness of the U.S. attacks, analysts said. But it could also ease pressure on Tehran to respond.\n\n>Joseph Votel, a retired U.S. Army general and former top Middle East commander, said the U.S. response had to send a message to Iran that would only be effective if it included direct attacks on Iranian targets, along with other strikes on its proxies.\n\n>\u201cThere has to be a very unambiguous message to Iran that we hold them responsible for the actions of these militias,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the targeting has to include some targets that are of value to Iran.\u201d\n\n>The targets don\u2019t need to be inside Iran to deliver the message, he added, but they need to be chosen carefully to avoid sparking a wider war. \u201cThey have the ability to strike back across the region with a fairly robust missile capability,\u201d he said.\n\n>Ali Vaez, director of the Iran Project at the International Crisis Group, a conflict-resolution think tank, said the death of U.S. service members in the Jordan attack has likely forced Biden to choose targets that could result in Iranian casualties.\n\n>\u201cIf they target IRGC assets but minimize fatalities, Iran might not necessarily respond in a way that would then extend the cycle of violence,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if there are IRGC fatalities, it will be hard for them to absorb that cost and not respond.\u201d\n\n\nMeanwhile, [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/02/01/biden-israel-settler-violence-palestinians-executive-order) is reporting that Biden is acting in Israel:\n\n>President Biden on Thursday signed an executive order allowing the U.S. to impose new sanctions on Israeli settlers \u2014 and potentially Israeli politicians and government officials \u2014 involved in violent attacks against Palestinians.\n\n>Why it matters: The unprecedented executive order is the most significant step any U.S. administration has ever taken in response to violence by Israeli settlers against Palestinian civilians in the West Bank.",

Mr. Zarif, considered a moderate, is well known to American officials.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThey called on Mr. Zarif because he can better analyze the situation for them and explain it to an audience and in this sensitive time they need top foreign policy experts,\u201d said Sassan Karimi, a political analyst in Tehran who co-teaches a university class with Mr. Zarif. \u201cThe goal is to navigate this serious crisis with every tool and in a manner that results in America not attacking Iran.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Mr. Khameini has told those close to him that he opposes war with the United States because preserving the Islamic regime\u2019s hold on power is the highest priority, and war would divert the world\u2019s attention from the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, according to a person affiliated with his circle and a military strategist with ties to the Revolutionary Guards.</p>\n\n<p>War could also have disastrous consequences domestically for ordinary people, and Iran is already plagued by international sanctions, unemployment and corruption. Many Iranians do not want war, fearing it would worsen things. Over the past two decades, they have seen U.S.-led invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, and the civil war in Syria, sow chaos and chronic instability.</p>\n\n<p>For a government that has repeatedly resorted to violence to crush popular challenges to its rule, conflict risks more internal turmoil. There is dissension even among religious conservatives, and worry that the country\u2019s troubles are insurmountable.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThere is not even a glimmer of hope for things improving in the Islamic Republic,\u201d wrote Mehdi Nassiri, a conservative cleric who has broken with the government and turned into a vocal critic, on social media. \u201cToday is better than tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/shadow-war-with-iran-risks-turning-into-a-direct-conflict-6b8eddd9?mod=newsviewer_click\">WSJ</a> has more details about U.S. strike plans:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Biden has approved plans for multiday strikes in Iraq and Syria against multiple targets, including Iranian personnel and facilities, according to U.S. officials. But the response, expected to begin as soon as this weekend, will be \u201ctiered,\u201d mixing military actions with other steps that can be adjusted to signal that Washington doesn\u2019t seek further escalation.</p>\n\n<p>The goal, U.S. officials say, is to get Iran and its proxies to dial back their attacks across the region as the White House and its allies pursue talks on a cease-fire between Hamas and Israel that they hope will de-escalate tensions.</p>\n\n<p>By signaling its intention well in advance of any strikes, the White House may give Iran time to reposition personnel and equipment, limiting the effectiveness of the U.S. attacks, analysts said. But it could also ease pressure on Tehran to respond.</p>\n\n<p>Joseph Votel, a retired U.S. Army general and former top Middle East commander, said the U.S. response had to send a message to Iran that would only be effective if it included direct attacks on Iranian targets, along with other strikes on its proxies.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThere has to be a very unambiguous message to Iran that we hold them responsible for the actions of these militias,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the targeting has to include some targets that are of value to Iran.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The targets don\u2019t need to be inside Iran to deliver the message, he added, but they need to be chosen carefully to avoid sparking a wider war. \u201cThey have the ability to strike back across the region with a fairly robust missile capability,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>Ali Vaez, director of the Iran Project at the International Crisis Group, a conflict-resolution think tank, said the death of U.S. service members in the Jordan attack has likely forced Biden to choose targets that could result in Iranian casualties.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf they target IRGC assets but minimize fatalities, Iran might not necessarily respond in a way that would then extend the cycle of violence,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if there are IRGC fatalities, it will be hard for them to absorb that cost and not respond.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/02/01/biden-israel-settler-violence-palestinians-executive-order\">Axios</a> is reporting that Biden is acting in Israel:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>President Biden on Thursday signed an executive order allowing the U.S. to impose new sanctions on Israeli settlers \u2014 and potentially Israeli politicians and government officials \u2014 involved in violent attacks against Palestinians.</p>\n\n<p>Why it matters: The unprecedented executive order is the most significant step any U.S. administration has ever taken in response to violence by Israeli settlers against Palestinian civilians in the West Bank.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Very good in a dogfight, though again the F-16 probably edges it out, but MUCH better in BVR thanks to its higher missile capacity. Again, if they have older radars and a worse data link profile they are probably slightly behind a more modern F-16 in capability. But they also carry twice the AAMRAMs as an F-16. -18s also can use nearly every important US A2G weapon in the arsenal, including LGBs, GPS bombs, and HARMs. THe only issue with weaponry is that while the USAF and Navy share *some* weapons in common, they dont share *all* weapons. So there is some redundancy there that would force Ukraine to double dip if they flew a mixed -16/-18 fleet. Moreover I'm not sure what limitations the Aus models have, if it would be hard to get them to use ordinance built for use by USN *Super*hornets. Lastly, the Aus planes are absolutely in 'rode hard, put away wet' condition. While you probably dont call them trash to the Australian's faces, its actually not a bad summary of their condition. Flight hours will be limited, maint hours will be long. \n\nWould it have helped? Sure something is better than nothing.

The Corps first identified the need for an infantry-controlled loitering munition in 2020, shortly after Azerbaijan used multiple types of one-way attack drones to devastate Armenian forces.*\n\n*Since then, the Marines have stood up several loitering munitions programs, including one called the Organic Precision Fire program that will provide squad and platoon-sized units with loitering munitions. That program is split into two elements: Organic Precision Fire\u2014Infantry and Organic Precision Fire\u2014Mounted, for use on vehicles.*\n\n*The Marine Corps is \u201cgoing pretty aggressively into identifying a lightweight solution for squads,\u201d said Travis Bowden, capabilities integration officer for Organic Precision Fires.*\n\n*Marines in the field will get the weapon \u201csometime in [fiscal year] 2027, Bowden said, though the timeline also depends on how well potential suppliers perform.*\n\n*Use of drones in Ukraine has validated many of the Marine Corps\u2019 assumptions about how to use loitering munitions, Bowden said. Still, he cautioned that the Marines\u2019 global, expeditionary nature means it has different priorities than Ukrainian drone-bombing units with short logistics chains.*\n\n*For one, fuzes, lithium batteries, and other elements of a loitering munition will have to be stored safely on ships and planes traveling anywhere in the world. The variation in climate from the sweltering Pacific to the freezing Arctic could also affect the munitions\u2019 battery life, he said.*\n\n*Changing weather could also affect accuracy, Bowden said. And the jury is still out on whether the service will choose a sophisticated, expensive weapon or a simpler, cheaper model, Bowden said. \u201cThat's why the lessons from Ukraine and other places are giving us some starting points to kind of validate what we're thinking,\u201d he said. Regardless, given the limitations of weather, electronic warfare, and logistics, Bodwen said he does not foresee loitering munitions \u201cdarkening the sky.\u201d*\n\n*Command and control systems will also need to improve for the Marine Corps to use the weapons, he said, including better intelligence collection for identifying targets and greater communications between units to coordinate strikes.*\n\n*Targeting, communications, and weapons will need to \u201cprogress together and mature together in order to realize that full targeting process that we're trying to get to the lowest level,\u201d of command, he said.*\n\n*The Marines\u2019 fielding of another drone, the resupply TRV-150C model, is already providing lessons in drone deployment, said Master Sgt. Christopher Genualdi, capabilities integration officer for aerial delivery and autonomous distribution systems.*\n\n*The Marine Corps announced the initial fielding of six of the large drones in November of last year. The drones are designed to drop-off payloads to Marines deployed in areas where an enemy\u2019s defenses prevent aerial resupply. The drones can fly a payload of 150 pounds about nine miles.*\n\n*The drones are so easy to fly that they are piloted by members of Marine logistics units, rather than dedicated drone pilots, Genualdi said. However, as troops learn to use the system, they\u2019ve discovered that there\u2019s no easy way to keep drones out of the way of other U.S. aircraft and airborne munitions.*\n\n*Units can manually deconflict airspace by verbally informing other units, including Marine aviators, of the drones presence, Genualdi said. Failing that, though, the Marine Corps systems do not easily allow for tracking of both unmanned and manned planes at the same time.*\n\n*\u201cI have a guy who works in the Direct Air Support Center, deconflicting in the airspace,\u201d he said, \u201cbut our systems don't necessarily talk to his.\u201d Genualdi said the issue isn\u2019t insolvable, pointing to successes in the commercial sector for tracking airborne vehicles.*\n\n*\u201cI'm able to go online right now and kind of see every single civilian aircraft,\u201d he said.*\n\n*The Marine Corps is also working through who is supposed to fix the drones when they break. The current repair program consists of contracted repair, in which drones are sent back to dedicated repair centers. In the field, though, Marines may need to learn how to make simple repairs, like swapping out motors. For example, troops qualified at micro-soldering might step into repair drones, Genualdi said.*",

Failing that, though, the Marine Corps systems do not easily allow for tracking of both unmanned and manned planes at the same time.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cI have a guy who works in the Direct Air Support Center, deconflicting in the airspace,\u201d he said, \u201cbut our systems don&#39;t necessarily talk to his.\u201d Genualdi said the issue isn\u2019t insolvable, pointing to successes in the commercial sector for tracking airborne vehicles.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cI&#39;m able to go online right now and kind of see every single civilian aircraft,\u201d he said.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The Marine Corps is also working through who is supposed to fix the drones when they break. The current repair program consists of contracted repair, in which drones are sent back to dedicated repair centers. In the field, though, Marines may need to learn how to make simple repairs, like swapping out motors. For example, troops qualified at micro-soldering might step into repair drones, Genualdi said.</em></p>\n</div>",

It doesn't appear (at a glance) that there is a [UN treaty](https://treaties.un.org/Pages/DB.aspx?path=DB/studies/page2_en.xml) dealing with arms transfers to terrorist groups/militant groups which attack civilians. Yes, this does appear to be an oversight, and it hardly seems just that Russia will not be held accountable for a lot of these egregious actions during the War in the Donbas. \n\nBut it also doesn't come as a shock to me, coming from the perspective of someone with legal training. UN treaties are hardly comprehensive.\n\nFrom skimming [the summary](https://www.icj-cij.org/sites/default/files/case-related/166/166-20240131-sum-01-00-en.pdf) of yesterday's judgement, it appears Ukraine was arguing for a broad definition of \"funds\" in order to fit the MH17 shootdown and other violence committed by Russian-armed groups in Ukraine under the treaty covering the financing of terrorism. I can understand why a majority of the justices were unwilling to stretch the treaty to encompass material support in general.\n\nAs for why the ICJ/World Court did not grant the requests for compensation and ruled against Ukraine on the issue of discrimination against Crimean Tatars, I'll have to finish reading later, but I would imagine issues of evidence and intent play a role.\n\nIn short, the ruling is a bit of a letdown, but makes some sense from a legal perspective and in light of the ICJ still struggling to gain legitimacy and be taken seriously on the international stage. I can see how adopting a more conservative and narrow approach to statutory interpretation might be seen as the better approach towards gaining legitimacy.",

I have few if any real followers (upon inspection only two that I know to be real accounts, David Helms, whom I have tweeted back and forth with about Ukraine, and Delta's corporate account from when I bitched at them about screwing up my flights many years ago), but lately I noticed a dramatic uptick in followers, all of whom display women's names, and all but one in first name/last name format. Everyone from \"Blair Kinsler\" up on the list of followers linked above. None have normal, random usernames like, for example, stult or shake_fist. Not even a male name. About twenty such people have followed me in the past two weeks. I now have a grand total of 31 followers, after 10+ years on twitter, where I admittedly have never been terribly active. \n\nMany of those who followed me over this period first liked various pro-Ukrainian tweets I made in reply to major media figures. To me, this looks like a totally unrestrained and transparent effort to establish a bot net focused on influencing the discourse around Ukraine, possibly even in a pro-Ukrainian direction, because they seem to be amplifying my pro-Ukrainian tweets. Although that could just be to establish pro-Ukrainian credentials before switching to amplifying pro-Russian views in the future. I did not see anything like this uptick in 2014, 2016, or 2020, all of which were years for peak Russian disinformation operations on American social media. \n\nRight now, I am especially wary of disinformation ops because it is a US presidential election year, and especially because this particular election has such enormous portent for international affairs generally and the Russo-Ukrainian War specifically. Even disinfo ops from the people I agree with concern me, because they introduce noise into the discourse that can obscure underlying and unpleasant realities, which I would rather be aware of than insulated from by propaganda. \n\nI'm also concerned that if such transparent bot networks are operating with impunity that Musk's takeover of Twitter and subsequent elimination of most of the content moderation teams there has opened the floodgates for abuse and manipulation. I may only be seeing pro-Ukrainian bot networks because I am a \"useful idiot\" for them in the sense that I promote views friendly to their cause, but it seems likely that other perhaps more subtle bot networks are pushing points of view that I strongly oppose. \n\nHas anyone else observed anything like this?

The news to me isn't so much that these shells will be filled with Hexal or essentially their bragging about Hexal's relative effectiveness, which whilst effective is kind of a big mixed bag situation... **But more that their \"mobilization\" shells are** ***not*** **going to be filled with Hexal but instead with regular TNT** or perhaps some other mix.\n\nThis probably represents a constraint in further expanding their shell production. It's faster to start using more readily available fillers, perhaps fillers that you can also source externally via your partners than to further increase the already prior increased and likely stretched to the limit domestic production of A-X-12.\n\nTNT is also just cheaper, and why bother wasting money on artillery rounds that are going to be fired in extremely high volume anyway? I can see the justification for it, even if I think this is less a move of principle and more a move of convenience/necessity. \n\nIt's also worth noting that the reason they have a different colour pallete is also because Russia have changed the production composition to avoid their typical grey casings, the traditional casings are meant for long term storage and to extend shelf life, which is kind of irrelevant for shells that are likely going to be shipped to the front line and fired within the month. There would also be some degree of weight savings, although I've got no reference as to whether removing this process is significant or not, this could be partly responsible for the \"slight increase in flight range\" that was mentioned. \n\nNot sure what the cost and time savings on production or aerodynamic/weight benefits would be like for removing this step of the process, but it's clearly enough of a difference that Russia have chosen to do it, although I'd guess the real motivator is going to be cost and production volume, any weight or range bonuses will likely be an incidental consequence of those decisions. \n\n>This fact, coupled with the fact that these ammunition are intended for the 152-mm 2S3 \u201cAkatsiya\u201d and D-20 guns, as well as the 122-mm 2S1 \u201cGvozdika\u201d and D-30 guns, which are being restored from storage, indicates their \u201cmobilization\u201d nature of production .\n\nWouldn't surprise me if they're restoring so many new artillery pieces from storage that the pressure from high volume firing of these pieces is posing a serious issue when it comes to keeping the guns supplied.
