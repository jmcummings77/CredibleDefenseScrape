Which may end up being another cause of problems, as there is a serious risk that it will be rushed, unstudied in its details and uncoordinated with other units and artillery, with the ensuing problems.\n\nThis is not the first time such problems have occurred. I heard that similar problems occurred last December near Terny (in the Kreminna sector) in the positions of the 97th Mech Battalion of the 60th Mechanized Brigade, and those with a certain knowledge of the history of this war will recall the case of the 115th Mechanized Brigade in Severodonetsk in May 2022. \n\nWhen, as it looks like regarding this case, the problems concern the command of the brigade, it's crucial that the HQ staff, with the brigade commander first and foremost, pay the consequences in terms of their careers. It's nothing irreparable, but the important thing is to treasure the mistakes to avoid committing them in the future.\n\nTranslation with DeepL.

A group of f****ts went to the rear and penetrated into Krokhmalne itself. They destroyed the SP [observation point] with its personnel and went back. By the way, the SP looked more like the military appeared here yesterday, not 10 months ago (at that time) - trenches to the waist, wood just lying over the dugout, only demystifying it.\n\n>\ud83d\uddfa This section is under the responsibility of the 103rd OBrTrO [TDF Brigade]. At the end of 2023, the Katsaps [Russians] pushed our guys away from the [Kupyansk-Svatove] railroad. Neither we nor the neighboring units knew about it.\n\n>\ud83d\udca5 The situation deteriorated on January 18, when a significant section of the front collapsed. One of the battalions of the 103rd did not even know about it, and was, to put it mildly, surprised when the f**kers started to climb in their rear. Approximately, at least 11 SPs and POCs [platoon-strongholds] were lost during that day. Neighboring units learned about the failure of the front when they saw the changes on the [DeepState's] map. I think it is unnecessary to explain how Kyslivka and Kotlyarivka felt. At the same time, the brigade leadership tried to hide the losses as much as possible. When we started passing on information about the failure through our connections, everyone was surprised. Moreover, many officers denied the information.\n\n>\ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddfa The enemy did not stop there, and around January 27, they attacked Tabaivka again, this time. Eventually, the Katsaps managed to capture the village, but due to its geography and lack of buildings, they were unable to gain a foothold. This time, the situation there was closely monitored by everyone, which did not allow the enemy to develop success in Pishchane or Berestove.\n\n>\ud83d\udd04 These events are reminiscent of the enemy's summer breakthrough near Novojehorivka and Nadiya. Since no conclusions were drawn at the level of the operational and tactical command of the troops, the events were repeated in Tabaivka and Krokhmalne.\n\n>\ud83e\udd81 The media reported that the brigade commander of the 103rd Brigade was suspended, and our friends also confirm this fact. His further fate is unknown, as well as there is no official news on this matter. The enemy's plans in this area were known in advance.\n\n>\ud83e\udee1 Many thanks directly to the soldiers of the 103rd Brigade and other units of the Defense Forces, who made great efforts to stop the enemy's attack and continue to hold it back.\n\n>\ud83d\udd04 Conclusions should be drawn from this and should not be repeated. Those responsible for failures and losses should be held accountable, and not, as is the case with the classics, appointed to some much higher positions. The actions of one person should not be higher than the lives of soldiers, who are the most valuable thing we have.",

This time, the situation there was closely monitored by everyone, which did not allow the enemy to develop success in Pishchane or Berestove.</p>\n\n<p>\ud83d\udd04 These events are reminiscent of the enemy&#39;s summer breakthrough near Novojehorivka and Nadiya. Since no conclusions were drawn at the level of the operational and tactical command of the troops, the events were repeated in Tabaivka and Krokhmalne.</p>\n\n<p>\ud83e\udd81 The media reported that the brigade commander of the 103rd Brigade was suspended, and our friends also confirm this fact. His further fate is unknown, as well as there is no official news on this matter. The enemy&#39;s plans in this area were known in advance.</p>\n\n<p>\ud83e\udee1 Many thanks directly to the soldiers of the 103rd Brigade and other units of the Defense Forces, who made great efforts to stop the enemy&#39;s attack and continue to hold it back.</p>\n\n<p>\ud83d\udd04 Conclusions should be drawn from this and should not be repeated. Those responsible for failures and losses should be held accountable, and not, as is the case with the classics, appointed to some much higher positions. The actions of one person should not be higher than the lives of soldiers, who are the most valuable thing we have.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

The weather was bad in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol that autumn, with wind and heavy rain.

The builders installed them upside down, or protruding from walls. Front doors were removed. Water leaked in and froze. There was no heating until late February. \u201cMost of the furniture people had was ruined, the floors all swelled and buckled,\u201d says Maksim.\n\n>R-Stroy had only been founded a few months before. It is run by two former state gas contractors, the director of a hospital construction company and a former regional official.\n\n>Almost a year after the work began, with Maksim\u2019s block regularly flooding when it rained, residents were still fighting to get R-Stroy to fix their building \u2014 and the further damage that its workers caused.\n\n> When Russian forces took control of Mariupol in May 2022, the UN estimated that 90 per cent of the residential buildings had been damaged or destroyed.\n\n>About 100,000 of the 430,000 people who lived in the city before the war remained. Ukrainian officials say 25,000 died during the two-month siege, although some estimates suggest the figure could be three times higher. Hundreds of thousands fled to Russia, to other parts of Ukraine, or into Europe.\n\n>The Russian government falsely claims the destruction of Mariupol was the work of \u201cUkrainian Nazis\u201d. But human rights groups have documented Russia\u2019s war crimes. The bombing of a theatre, a key shelter, killed hundreds. A strike on a maternity ward left pregnant women in the rubble. With investigators unable to access the city, and with Moscow racing to plaster over the horrors of the war, it\u2019s feared more Russian atrocities may remain undiscovered. \u201cRussia is trying to destroy all evidence of its war crimes,\u201d says Dmytro Lubinets, Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights.\n\n> Many of those who remained once the fighting subsided were elderly, some with younger family members staying to take care of them. Some believed Moscow\u2019s promises; others were reluctant to leave, fearing they would lose their homes and with it their only wealth.\n\n>By the summer of 2022, the residents of Mariupol were adjusting to life under Russian occupation and attempting to rebuild their lives. Nearly two years later, many are still waiting.\n\n> Two weeks before the last Ukrainian fighters had surrendered, Russia announced a master plan for the city, produced by the Russian Ministry of Construction and the Moscow-based Unified Research and Design Institute.\n\n> It set out a vision for Mariupol\u2019s reconstruction from 2022 through to 2035. The city\u2019s population would double to 212,000 inhabitants in the remaining months of 2022, then grow to 350,000 by 2025 and half a million by 2035. \n\n\n> The document was a sham.\n\n>The Russian model was based on outdated Ukrainian plans produced prior to 2016 and taking into account none of the changes that had taken place since.\n\n>In the years leading up to the war, the city had streamlined bureaucracy, invested in services and infrastructure and created new public spaces. Though there was much left to do, Mariupol had become significantly more modern \u2014 and European. Vadym Boychenko, the Ukrainian mayor of Mariupol who is now in exile says: \u201cThe Russians are dragging us back to Soviet times.\u201d\n\n>The reconstruction work was loudly celebrated in Russian state media and by Russian YouTubers. They spoke proudly of a restored tram system and a fleet of new buses that had arrived from St Petersburg. Soon, swiftly-built apartment complexes were being shown off to the public.\n\n>Oleg Morgun, head of the Russian administration in Mariupol, posted photos on Telegram of himself inspecting buildings or discussing the gritting of roads. His posts portrayed life returning to normal, with Russian companies sponsoring trips to the zoo for local children and Russian Victory Day celebrations.\n\n> In March 2023, Putin visited Mariupol. Widely reported in Russian and western media, the trip attempted to normalise Russian control of the region. He toured rebuilt sites, as well as the newly constructed Nevsky neighbourhood on the city\u2019s western edge. A video published by the Kremlin showed Russia\u2019s president meeting happy residents.\n\n>In the background, a woman can be heard shouting: \u201cIt\u2019s not real! It\u2019s all for show!\u201d The shouting was quickly edited out.\n\n>Watching from afar, exiled Ukrainian civil servants were devastated. The Russian authorities boasting about new schools and kindergartens were putting the finishing touches to facilities constructed by the Ukrainians. The new buses and trams, with \u201cMariupol and St Petersburg, twin cities\u201d on the side, were rebranded Ukrainian models bought just before the war. \u201cIt\u2019s our tram, it\u2019s even with our registration number,\u201d says Mykyta Biriukov, Mariupol\u2019s former deputy director of transport.\n\n>Now without enough drivers, the buses ran intermittently. The heating didn\u2019t work, leaving passengers to complain that during winter it was warmer outside than on board, Biriukov says. Only part of the tram network was restored, its routes set up with no thought to where people needed to go.\n\n> The rebuilding of Mariupol is a classic Russian \u201cmega-project,\u201d says Shumanov. Projects of this sort receive massive state budgets and are expected to be completed in minimal time. Realities on the ground, like the number of available contractors, are often ignored, leading to problems with the work. \u201cThere\u2019s also a total lack of transparency around the way the money is spent, creating seriously fertile ground for corruption,\u201d Shumanov says.\n\n> Across the city, residents have shared major problems with their homes on social media. Their accounts are likely to be just the \u201ctip of the iceberg,\u201d Shumanov says, as Russia controls the newly-occupied territories with an iron grip and most people fear speaking out. The videos portray the dereliction in which people live, but also the ways in which the so-called reconstruction has made a difficult situation worse.\n\n>Not far from the fake Crimean villages built to impress Catherine the Great, cracks were starting to show in Russia\u2019s Potemkin facade.\n\n> In 2001, 21-year-old Repik founded R-Pharm with $40,000 of capital \u2014 half provided by his mother. He is now worth an estimated $2.4bn. In the first six months of 2021, the company sealed more contracts with the Russian government than any other firm, worth Rbs51bn, or 13 per cent of total government spending on tenders.\n\nAn accompanying [AP](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-erasing-mariupol-499dceae43ed77f2ebfe750ea99b9ad9) investigation from 2022 which looked at civilian deaths and destruction of the city.",

Nearly two years later, many are still waiting.</p>\n\n<p>Two weeks before the last Ukrainian fighters had surrendered, Russia announced a master plan for the city, produced by the Russian Ministry of Construction and the Moscow-based Unified Research and Design Institute.</p>\n\n<p>It set out a vision for Mariupol\u2019s reconstruction from 2022 through to 2035. The city\u2019s population would double to 212,000 inhabitants in the remaining months of 2022, then grow to 350,000 by 2025 and half a million by 2035. </p>\n\n<p>The document was a sham.</p>\n\n<p>The Russian model was based on outdated Ukrainian plans produced prior to 2016 and taking into account none of the changes that had taken place since.</p>\n\n<p>In the years leading up to the war, the city had streamlined bureaucracy, invested in services and infrastructure and created new public spaces. Though there was much left to do, Mariupol had become significantly more modern \u2014 and European. Vadym Boychenko, the Ukrainian mayor of Mariupol who is now in exile says: \u201cThe Russians are dragging us back to Soviet times.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The reconstruction work was loudly celebrated in Russian state media and by Russian YouTubers. They spoke proudly of a restored tram system and a fleet of new buses that had arrived from St Petersburg. Soon, swiftly-built apartment complexes were being shown off to the public.</p>\n\n<p>Oleg Morgun, head of the Russian administration in Mariupol, posted photos on Telegram of himself inspecting buildings or discussing the gritting of roads. His posts portrayed life returning to normal, with Russian companies sponsoring trips to the zoo for local children and Russian Victory Day celebrations.</p>\n\n<p>In March 2023, Putin visited Mariupol. Widely reported in Russian and western media, the trip attempted to normalise Russian control of the region. He toured rebuilt sites, as well as the newly constructed Nevsky neighbourhood on the city\u2019s western edge. A video published by the Kremlin showed Russia\u2019s president meeting happy residents.</p>\n\n<p>In the background, a woman can be heard shouting: \u201cIt\u2019s not real! It\u2019s all for show!\u201d The shouting was quickly edited out.</p>\n\n<p>Watching from afar, exiled Ukrainian civil servants were devastated. The Russian authorities boasting about new schools and kindergartens were putting the finishing touches to facilities constructed by the Ukrainians. The new buses and trams, with \u201cMariupol and St Petersburg, twin cities\u201d on the side, were rebranded Ukrainian models bought just before the war. \u201cIt\u2019s our tram, it\u2019s even with our registration number,\u201d says Mykyta Biriukov, Mariupol\u2019s former deputy director of transport.</p>\n\n<p>Now without enough drivers, the buses ran intermittently. The heating didn\u2019t work, leaving passengers to complain that during winter it was warmer outside than on board, Biriukov says. Only part of the tram network was restored, its routes set up with no thought to where people needed to go.</p>\n\n<p>The rebuilding of Mariupol is a classic Russian \u201cmega-project,\u201d says Shumanov. Projects of this sort receive massive state budgets and are expected to be completed in minimal time. Realities on the ground, like the number of available contractors, are often ignored, leading to problems with the work. \u201cThere\u2019s also a total lack of transparency around the way the money is spent, creating seriously fertile ground for corruption,\u201d Shumanov says.</p>\n\n<p>Across the city, residents have shared major problems with their homes on social media. Their accounts are likely to be just the \u201ctip of the iceberg,\u201d Shumanov says, as Russia controls the newly-occupied territories with an iron grip and most people fear speaking out. The videos portray the dereliction in which people live, but also the ways in which the so-called reconstruction has made a difficult situation worse.</p>\n\n<p>Not far from the fake Crimean villages built to impress Catherine the Great, cracks were starting to show in Russia\u2019s Potemkin facade.</p>\n\n<p>In 2001, 21-year-old Repik founded R-Pharm with $40,000 of capital \u2014 half provided by his mother. He is now worth an estimated $2.4bn. In the first six months of 2021, the company sealed more contracts with the Russian government than any other firm, worth Rbs51bn, or 13 per cent of total government spending on tenders.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>An accompanying <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-erasing-mariupol-499dceae43ed77f2ebfe750ea99b9ad9\">AP</a> investigation from 2022 which looked at civilian deaths and destruction of the city.</p>\n</div>",

When I was in the Army I was a sniper. Allow me to explain.\n\nThe -FC optic allows shooters to do less than what snipers have been able to already far cheaper do for decades. Lase a target to get the range. Get density altitude. Use a computerized ballistic calculator to find out where to aim based on the range and DA by being given a holdover or under. But the -FC does it in one package and is faster than most setups a sniper could use, as most use separate laser range finders, handheld ballistic computers, handheld weather meters providing DA, etched reticles for holds, etc. \n\nSo those provide part of the \"Dope,\" which are the variables one needs to know for long range engagements to calculate external ballistics (what happens to bullet after it leaves the barrel but before it hits the target).

Lase a target to get the range. Get density altitude. Use a computerized ballistic calculator to find out where to aim based on the range and DA by being given a holdover or under. But the -FC does it in one package and is faster than most setups a sniper could use, as most use separate laser range finders, handheld ballistic computers, handheld weather meters providing DA, etched reticles for holds, etc. </p>\n\n<p>So those provide part of the &quot;Dope,&quot; which are the variables one needs to know for long range engagements to calculate external ballistics (what happens to bullet after it leaves the barrel but before it hits the target).

Two, SOCOM has been prepping to fight Near Peer just as much as Big Army since 2014. Third, SOCOM didn't want NGSW because the people in SOCOM who are the ones whose opinions matter (senior NCO trigger pullers and absolute subject matter experts) don't think the opinions of people like [Robert Scales](https://taskandpurpose.com/news/army-next-generation-rifle-caliber/) are worth shit, despite US Army and USMC general officers lapping up his crap.\n\nWhich is the reason for the disconnect. A bunch of general officers who haven't even been issued a rifle in almost 30 years, who were so far removed from the tactical side of the latest 20 years that many still think the bayonet is relevant, who haven't participated in small unit tactics since they were captains back in the early 90s, made all the decisions for the NGSW.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Yeah, agreed, but kind of out of scope for what we're discussing.\n\nit absolutely isn't. It's the same officers who pushed NGSW that ignored the updated armor threat, where AT4 cannot reliably kill modern tanks. Which means we only have Javelins in the US Army's infantry platoon capable of killing them, and only two per, which means the Ukrainians were FAR more capable of killing armor than we are.\n\nSince the entire point of NGSW was to increase lethality against a Near Peer threat, aka Russia and China, that was a pretty stupid decision to ignore the important weapon that actually matters and prioritize the one that doesn't at all.\n\nThis war proved NGSW is stupid. Both sides wear ballistic plates, nobody gives a shit if their infantry can't penetrate plates or can't hit enemy out to 600 meters.",

Third, SOCOM didn&#39;t want NGSW because the people in SOCOM who are the ones whose opinions matter (senior NCO trigger pullers and absolute subject matter experts) don&#39;t think the opinions of people like <a href=\"https://taskandpurpose.com/news/army-next-generation-rifle-caliber/\">Robert Scales</a> are worth shit, despite US Army and USMC general officers lapping up his crap.</p>\n\n<p>Which is the reason for the disconnect. A bunch of general officers who haven&#39;t even been issued a rifle in almost 30 years, who were so far removed from the tactical side of the latest 20 years that many still think the bayonet is relevant, who haven&#39;t participated in small unit tactics since they were captains back in the early 90s, made all the decisions for the NGSW.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yeah, agreed, but kind of out of scope for what we&#39;re discussing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>it absolutely isn&#39;t. It&#39;s the same officers who pushed NGSW that ignored the updated armor threat, where AT4 cannot reliably kill modern tanks. Which means we only have Javelins in the US Army&#39;s infantry platoon capable of killing them, and only two per, which means the Ukrainians were FAR more capable of killing armor than we are.</p>\n\n<p>Since the entire point of NGSW was to increase lethality against a Near Peer threat, aka Russia and China, that was a pretty stupid decision to ignore the important weapon that actually matters and prioritize the one that doesn&#39;t at all.</p>\n\n<p>This war proved NGSW is stupid. Both sides wear ballistic plates, nobody gives a shit if their infantry can&#39;t penetrate plates or can&#39;t hit enemy out to 600 meters.</p>\n</div>",

Between  measures like taking cover, using proper individual movement techniques when exposed (to include crawling), using camouflage,, etc, so the enemy often doesn't make it easy for the Average Joe infantryman to spot them. Those that do win the Darwin Award early on. When the enemy are spotted at a distance it's usually because they are at an angle that they didn't think the enemy could see them, meaning an exposed flank. Often too they are moving, making hitting them that much harder.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* As I mentioned before, making hits at long range is very challenging, beyond just having a scope that does the ballistic calculations which is just one aspect. Hence why specially trained and equipped snipers dominate that range, and machine gunners.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Most of the body isn't covered by ballistic plates, actually most of the torso isn't even covered. And the plates only work when the wearer is fully exposed frontally or rearwards to the threat, the more angled the wearer, the less they protect. Often in combat when you're getting shot at, especially early on in a firefight when you're out of cover and at the most risk, you will be angled to the threat. Especially since so much of infantry small unit tactics is based on trying to gain those angles on the enemy, to keep trying to outflank them, hit them from exposed sides they aren't paying attention to, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Even when enemy don't wear ballistic plates, small arms don't do much killing. Most of what they do is suppression, to fix an enemy in place to try to maneuver to either break contract or more likely to assault them or to bring in heavier fires to kill them. If hits are possible, that's awesome, because nothing suppresses the enemy better than when they get hit. But near misses are often just as good. But this is a reason small caliber high velocity cartridges are great, they don't recoil much and large load outs are possible in comparison to something like 7.62 NATO or 6.8 NGSW, that has bulky, heavy, high recoiling ammo. The overall load out will be smaller unless they deliberately give up mobility, and slow follow up shots, especially for anyone who isn't an expert shooter who is well trained in recoil mitigation techniques.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The weapon systems that the infantry most fear are heavy weapons, because they have the highest hit probability (large kill radius) and because they cause the most devastating wounds (those who are hit often have multiple severe wounds). If you're trying to kill the enemy, you want to use HE against them too. So most well thought out tactics put less emphasis on scoring kills with small arms and more using them to enable kills with heavy weapons.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* If you are wearing plates, and the enemy shoots at you at long range, your day is going to be ruined even if the plates aren't penetrated. At a minimum, you'll be suppressed, forced to take cover as you are being shot at. Even if you get pegged in the plate and the bullet is stopped, that's going to create a significant emotional event that's going to impede thought process and aggression. Because so much of the body isn't covered by plates, and because you'll likely not be 100% frontally or rearwards facing your opponent, there is a VERY high chance you get shot somewhere that is exposed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* When small arms do kill at range, often it's the result of special circumstances. A sniper or designated marksman that knows what they're doing, especially if they have thermal optic that can more easily spot targets. A machine gunner whose cone of fire makes up for lack of precision to score hits, especially on moving targets.

Sure, the Ukrainians would keep this info quiet until they're withdrawn, but... none of the lines outside of the breakout have shifted **at all**.\n\nI'm starting to suspect no withdrawal has actually began, and if it did begin, it began only recently.\n\nI'll also append some much more detailed analysis:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/1alv5ww/credibledefense_daily_megathread_february_08_2024/kpicqi0/",

It was they who faced and initially repelled the first action of the Ukrainian counteroffensive, namely the mechanized convoy of the Ukrainian 23rd Mechanized Brigade in the direction of Novodarivka on 4 June 2023. \n\nThe reinforcements that arrived were mainly those that were deployed in Kherson, which is a sector that has only been warming up since early August, so I would say that up to that point the Russian units deployed along the Dnipro River could be considered reserves. \n\nIf I recall correctly some units such as the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade and 177 Naval Infantry Regiment and the 22nd and 45th Spetsnaz GRU Brigades were deployed along the axis from Kamyanske to Polohy as early as around March 2023, in anticipation of the counteroffensive. \n\nThen, at the end of June, the 34th Mountain Brigade of the 49th Army and the 247th Air Assault Regiment of the 7th VDV Division were sent to the Velyka Novosilka sector and the 11th and 83rd VDV Brigades to the Bakhmut sector, and at the end of July the 56th and 108th Air Assault Regiments of the 7th VDV Division to the Orikhiv sector. All of them from Kherson. \n\nThere were indeed lateral redeployments later: the 71st Regiment Motorized of the 42nd MRD (58th Army) was sent to the Orikhiv sector from Velyka Novosilka in late August, together with the 247th Air Assault Regiment. Elements of the 177th NIR also likely fought in Robotyne, and later in October the 136th Motorized Brigade (58th Army) arrived around Robotyne from the Velyka Novosilka sector that had cooled down, to relieve the battered subunits of the 42nd Motorized Division. \n\nThis is not considering the regiments of the Territorial Forces: in the Orikhiv sector, in addition to the 1430th that was already there, the 1429th, 1441st, 1455th, 387th, 1152nd, 1251st, etc. arrived in the following weeks/months... In addition to several BARS detachments.\n\nA very important matter to consider is the fact that from the Kharkiv counteroffensive to, for several of them, even late spring 2023, most of the formations of the Western and Central Military Districts were in Belarus to reconstitute themselves. Their return made it possible, over the summer, to send the 98th VDV Division and 31st VDV Brigade to Bakhmut and then the 76th VDV Division to the Orikhiv sector, as well as heating things up in the north-eastern front. Let's recall that Russia deployed its first new formation just in August 2023, namely the 70th Motorized Division of the 18th Army in Kherson (excluding the 3rd Corps during the late summer 2022). Beside the Territorial Forces, in late 2022 and in the first part of 2023, Russian efforts were focused on bringing existing formations to full strength, both by replenishing existing battalions and attaching new ones to brigades/regiments, after in the second half of 2022 most regular Russian units were manned for a fraction of their theoretical levels. Add to that the creation of several reserve regiments of 1st and 2nd Corps, which were then sent to the South to reinforce the front line against the counteroffensive.",

The main limiter for small drones in Ukraine (for both sides) is communications with their controller. Russia is already using jamming as their main anti-drone tool, since it's easy to use & deploy and very effective against consumer-grade hardware. But with drone technology getting more mature and more standardized (Ukraine has recently created a new \"drone\" branch of their military to coordinate drone efforts), autonomous drone guidance is probably in very late testing stages, if not deployed already. Even in a reduced capacity, a human controller could fly a drone to where they can see the target, then let the drone take over in the final strike. This would work very well against static targets like towed artillery and probably also well against larger targets like trucks and tanks. A more advanced system could identify targets all on it's own, perhaps after it flies to the coordinates of a known enemy asset. This would mean that local-area jamming becomes less effective as the drone flying into the jammed area wouldn't mean it couldn't hit its target, and the range of drones could be extended since they no longer need to maintain line-of-sight to the their controllers as they dive towards the ground. Additionally, better software is a massive force-multiplier, since one firmware update for a common drone type can be copied essentially for free to every current and future drone it's compatible with.\n\nHow does Russia counter this threat? First of all, they will start moving assets back beyond what was once the maximum range of Ukrainian drones, and move jammers forwards to block access to Russian lines before targets become visible (of course, those jammers are themselves targets, but that's a price they may have to pay). Second, they shift defenses towards hard-kill measures, starting with improved netting and trench-covers to catch drones before they strike, and eventually moving towards smaller AA systems than can be deployed widely along the front line. The latter option seems further away (and more expensive), but conceptually consumer-grade drones are delicate and slow enough to be vulnerable to small-arms fire at close range. WWII-style quad mounts could see some kind of a comeback (perhaps even 14.5mm? It's a Russian cartridge that has a history of AA use after all), potentially with their own software upgrades providing lead and drop estimates to their operator.",
