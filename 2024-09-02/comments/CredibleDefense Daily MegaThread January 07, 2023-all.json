I think this might be really optimistic, I tried to gather together who could deliver Leopard tanks, but a lot of this is probably not extraordinarily accurate.\n\nI am in serious doubt that the 2A6 or 2A7 versions would go to Ukraine. That leaves 2A4 and 2A5 (I don't think anyone is using 2A3 anymore). Last I heard, all the German 2A5 were upgraded to 2A6 which kind of knocks the Bundeswehr out of the running.\n\nAFAIK, active users of the 2A4 are\nSpain, Turkey, Switzerland, Austria, Canada, Finland, Greecy, Hungary, Indonesia, Poland and Norway.\n\nSpain has around 100 I think which would be a great source BUT there is the question of the state they are in. There was a story about Spain sending theres but from what I read, they were in a deplorable state. This doesn't mean the remaining 2A4s are in a similar state, but I just honestly don't know. This is true for all of these countries by the way.\n\nNext is Turkey with more than 300 tanks, who I don't think is gonna donate tanks to Ukraine, as I understand it, they are trying to set themselves up as a neutral third party so I wouldn't expect much.\n\nSwitzerland (~200 tanks) is neutral and blocked deliveries of other weapons to Ukraine, don't expect much there.  \n  \nAustria has around 50 2A4s, but essentially \"see Switzerland\".  \n  \nCanada with 60 tanks and I think they might be willing to hand a few over, but probably not enough to merit the extra supply chain. If they send 6, that's a significant chunk of their armored power.  \n  \nFinland is also another big possibility. They have ~130 2A4s I think and they are VERY willing to help Ukraine because it goes against their greatest threat. At the same time, they also have a massive landborder with Russia and are not in NATO yet (they have some promises from UK and US AFAIK). So while they probably wouldn't send a 100, they are definetly in the running.  \n  \nGreece with almost 200 tanks has Turkey to worry about, which is why they have so many in the first place. I wouldn't expect more than a token force.  \n  \nHungary with their 10 tanks is Hungary and probably won't do shit unless there is a regime change.  \n  \nIndonesia probably doesn't want to get involved.  \n  \nPoland is interesting. Poland has about a 100 2A4s but their government made some moves that startled me. Maybe I misunderstood some of it. First, when Germany talked about the \"Ringtausch\", they wanted 2A7s for Tanks and IFVs from the 70s. This seems to me as if it was designed to make sure there wasn't a deal because they knew they would never get it. If they did think it was reasonable, it seems as if they were trying to heavily profit by helping Ukraine.  \nWhen Germany tried to set up a repair center for it's PZH 2000 in Poland, the Polish government asked for the transfer of technology. Now, German companies are incredibly reluctant to do this and I'm pretty sure the Polish government know this. Again either they knew it would be a deal breaker or they thought it was reasonable and tried to profit off helping Ukraine again. I get that they are probably trying to set up their own arms industry but it was still a weird move in my mind.   \nTL;DR: If other countries send Leos, I assume Poland will send some as well, but I have no idea what they will want in exchange or the condition of the vehicles. If I had to guess, I think they would probably send 30-40 tanks.  \n  \nAs for Norway, they don't have that many but they might send a few I guess.\n  \n\nFor the 2A5s, you I think only Poland is currently using them? See the same there. Sweden has a tank which I think is based on the 2A5 and I think they might be willing to send some.  \n  \nSo from active stocks, it's not a huge amount that might be willing/available.  \n  \nI think more interesting is the above plus whatever the producer has sitting around in warehouses. AFAIK there are a bunch of tanks sitting around waiting to be modernized. These might be diverted. I would hope that at the start of the war, Krauss-Maffei not only upgraded their production capabilities, and did a thorough inventory of what they had lying around.  \n   \n   \n  \n\nTL;DR: If they get more than 100 Leopards 2, I would be surprised. If they get more than 150, I'd be astonished.",

                "body": "Some Russian milbloggers did a good overview here:\n\nhttps://.me/milinfolive/95213\n\nThey basically say a few hundred Leopard 2A4s but they don't expect more modern versions to be sent:\n\nAgainst the background of the desire of several states at once to provide Ukraine with their Leopard 2 tanks, we will give some general statistics on the total number of tanks of this type among countries that either actively support the Armed Forces of Ukraine with the supply of armored vehicles, or have publicly expressed a desire to do so, and also express our thoughts on this matter.\n\nFirst of all, it is worth starting, of course, with Germany. At the end of 2021, the Bundeswehr had approximately 285 Leopard 2 tanks of modifications 2A5, 2A6 and 2A7 / 2A7V (of which only about 180 were in combat readiness). In addition, Rheinmetall has some stock (approximately 50 units) of obsolete Leopard 2A4s.\n\nThe next major operator of the Leopards is Poland. At the moment, its ground forces have approximately 250 Leopard 2 tanks, of which 126 are in the 2A4 modification, 16 in the 2PL modification, and 105 in the 2A5 modification. According to plans for the near future, Poland plans to withdraw all of its Leopards from service and replace them with the American \u041c1\u04102 Abrams SEP v.3 and South Korean K2 Black Panthers.\n\nSpain is armed with 327 Leopard 2 tanks at once, of which 219 are in the 2E (2A6 +) modification and 108 in the 2A4 modification (most of them are in storage).\n\nNext on the list is Finland. The defense forces of this state are armed with about 200 Leopard 2 units, of which about 100 are in the 2A4 modification (mostly in storage) and about 100 in the 2A6 modification.\n\nOf particular note are Turkey with its 316 Leopard 2A4 units, 84 of which are being upgraded to the Leopard 2A4TR variant, and Greece with 170 Leopard 2A6HELs and approximately 180 Leopard 2A4s.\n\nFrom the largest owners of Leopards, let's move on to a brief mention of other countries.\n\nSweden: 120 Leopard 2S (Stridsvagn 122, upgraded 2A5).\n\nNorway: 52 Leopard 2A4NO units, of which only 36 are in service (the rest are in storage). Starting in 2025, all current Leopards are planned to be replaced by either the K2 Black Panther or the Leopard 2A7.\n\nDenmark: 44 Leopard 2 tanks, of which 26 units are in the 2A7M+DK modification and another 18 in the 2A5DK modification, also being upgraded to the 2A7M+DK level.\n\nCanada: Approximately 40 Leopard 2 tanks in service, of which 20 are 2A4M CAN and 20 are 2A6M CAN. About 40 more Leopard 2A4 units are used as training vehicles or converted into ARVs.\n\nPortugal: 37 Leopard 2A6PO, since 2026 it is planned to modernize all tanks, including the installation of active protection systems (KAZ).\n\nOther operators of Leopard 2 tanks of various modifications are not taken into account in this analysis, since they either did not supply or announced the supply of armored vehicles to Ukraine (Austria, Switzerland, Chile, Singapore, Qatar), or they themselves had just received Leopard 2 tanks under a contract or in exchange deliveries of USSR armored vehicles to Ukraine (Hungary, Czech Republic)\n\n\nConclusions on the published list of countries with \"Leopards\":\n\n1. First of all, it should be understood that Western armies will not be ready to part with their most advanced modifications of the Leopard 2 tanks (2A5, 2A6, 2A7). Most of all, this concerns the small armies of the small states of Europe. In addition, most countries that have even obsolete Leopard 2A4s in service will also not be ready to part with them to the detriment of their own defense capability.\n\n2. As an example, we can cite such countries as Turkey and Greece, which, although they have an impressive fleet of Leopard 2 tanks, are also unlikely to transfer some of them to Kyiv for various reasons. The main reason here will be the damage to the defense capability of these two states, which are in a state of \"cold war\". Recall that in exchange for the supply of obsolete Soviet armored vehicles to Kyiv, Greece negotiated replacement supplies of German equipment for itself. Turkey, in addition to the presence of a smoldering conflict in Syria, and despite its supply of armored vehicles and drones to Ukraine, is still trying to balance on the edge and maintain its external neutrality and relations with Russia, acting as a platform for various exchanges and negotiations.\n\n3. Thus, in the near future, Ukraine can expect to receive Leopard 2 tanks, most likely only 2A4 modifications and removed from storage for the most part. In this case, it will potentially be possible to talk about a maximum of a couple of hundred vehicles (Rheinmetall stocks, warehouses of the armies of Spain and Finland). In the medium term, as the Leopards are replaced by American and Korean tanks, Poland may also join the supply.",

                "body": "In the US, we just had an election. This week the newly composed House of Representatives met for the first time, they usually knock out some easy paperwork the first week of the year to kick things off. Typically the leader of the majority party (simple majority, so 50%+1. Think the number for the full body is 218 representatives, not hard given its a two party system) is elected Speaker by their full party, minus the opposition who always votes no. Its a very symbolic vote. In the US typically any concessions that need to be made to keep the majority party unified behind a candidate is done over the Xmas break OR one candidate bows out, and they rally behind a new one. More likely tho if a Speaker falls its mid term, so a different process. \n\nAnyway, this time it was very contentious. For the first time in 100 years, the party leader of the majority FAILED to win the office on the first ballot (that is, during the typically ceremonial vote). This is because a group of 20 insurgents on the far right of the Republican party used the very slim margin in the House (10 votes between Rs & Ds) to block their party's leader from becoming Speaker. This led to a pretty emotional fight on the floor of the House and 15 rounds of voting before the leader, Kevin McCarthy, was finally elected. It hasn't taken this long to vote for a speaker since the 19th century and the debates over slavery. \n\nReportedly to win reelection McCarthy had to give up a lot of things to placate the radicals in his caucus. This includes a one-vote threshold for a motion to vacate his office. This is basically like a vote-of-no-confidence in a parliamentary government. In the past the threshold has been a majority of the majority, if 50%+1 of your party say youre out, youre out. The one vote threshold means that now any one of the 20 can hold him hostage over a piece of legislation and reignite this Speaker battle at any time. Additionally, the insurgents will be given powerful position on legislative committees, more seats on the Rules Committee which sets up how the whole House works every term, the ability to amend bills after they hit the floor (it seems like a technical point, but this is a HUGE deal as the Speaker's real power is in having a chokehold on the legislation that actually gets voted on. It also makes it more likely last minute changes can be made to win votes, rewarding holdouts who take things to the limit). They also secured a promise on several key bills. This includes a general spending freeze for the US government in FY 2024, and probably also FY2025. And an unspecified amount of austerity attached to the debt ceiling bill, which is a must pass bill that authorizes the Treasury to take out loans. Without it not only would the government shut down, but the US would *maybe* default on its sovereign debt (there are some legal theories that that cant actually happen, but its the kind of thing you dont want to theorize over, ya know?) \n\nIn relation to this forum, the insurgents are probably the loudest Ukraine skeptic group in the US government. They have opposed the war, and generally they are very isolationist. The concessions theyve won, including the spending freeze and the ability to amend legislation, would give them a good opportunity to slice down or even eliminate Ukraine aid. Or control the kinds of aid that gets sent. Or any number of horrid things. Furthermore the level of defense spending cuts lines up more or less with the amount thats been spent *so far* on the war, theyre talking about \\~$75b in overall cuts. IIRC the US has given about $40b over the last year? Keep in mind two things, the DoD gave away a lot of stuff that it now needs to buy back, and almost certainly things like expanding munitions production is coming out of the general budget not already appropriated Ukraine dollars. Thats going to cost a lot of money. Second, the DoD is both developing new autonomous systems AND trying to expand and retool to meet the threat from China. Were entering a period where theoretically the spending was going to go up *anyway*. So a cap is already bad, it means they wont be able to meet all these needs. AND it places the institution in a position where it may become a lot more conservative about what it will allow the White House to send. The Army is okay with sending Bradleys because it thinks itll get something new soon to replace it. The USMC is okay sending howitzers because it thinks itll be getting lots more HIMARS. If suddenly that math changes, you may not see the same kinds of packages go out. Maybe, a lot of this is speculation. \n\nAlso keep the big picture in mind, the House is 1/3rd of the legislative process. The Senate and WH remain unified and (mostly) free from chaos. Anything the House tries to do will have to go through them before becoming law. But the real (and likely) nightmare scenario is one where the choices are A) pay the nation's debts, B) cut what little discretionary social spending the US has or C) cut military spending. The insurgents are exactly the kind of people who will use Ukraine and a sovereign debt default to try and fuck the WH. This will almost certainly politicize war aid, which has previously been pretty widely supported.",

It 1000% depends on what is hit, and where.  \n\n\nDerail and destroy a locomotive? - Run 'light power' down and hook up / go.  \nDestroy a locomotive? - Lift off rails via crane, see above.  \n\n\nCan't move ahead? Run light power down, attach to train to reverse, put work train on and repair or repair from the other side.  \n\n\nDestroy / damage track? Next question is, how much track and where? If it's one section of track, it can be replaced by a crew within an hour. Maybe you end up with a speed restriction, but it's still manageable until further repairs can be made. Continuous-Welded-Rail is really neat, you can lay IIRC several thousand feet per day. Jointed rail is slower sure, but you can swap track out in an hour.\n\nThe time to resolve is 100% dependent on how accessible the track is, especially to roads.  How much damage plays a part, but the easier it is to access, the easier things are to fix. \n\nThe big thing is, one major attack is less valuable than multiple small attacks. The more smaller attacks, the more track inspections, the more fatigue of work crews, and most importantly, jamming the network up.\n\nTrains are not trucks, Operation Stack doesn't apply. Block a track for a day, and you have delays for 2-3 more. It's a death of a thousand cuts. \n\nThe real weak points are not tracks, nor trains, nor rolling stock.\n\nThe weak points are as follows:\n\n1. Bridges - Bridges take longer to repair, and even a temporary repair may end up with speed or load restrictions.\n2. Turnouts -  Those Y sections are much harder and more expensive to make, also take a long time to replace.\n3. Railroad signaling - It's a way to immediately slow, or close a line down. Losing trackside communication and that level of management / traffic control is quite a big deal.  That is also components that sure, can be fixed quickly, but there is a lot less 'Make do and Mend'. It also ties up maintenance and signal forces to inspect and repair.\n4. Rail yards - More valuable. Lots of tracks, slows down switching, has a lot of complexity in design, and also causes a lot less track to be available to put cars, causing almost a ground stop effect. Also, see point 3 with regards to signaling.\n\n Really, attacking rail lines and hoping to grind the network to a halt needs to be done in a wide way.  That little damage can add up. I've seen trains held up for -days- due to major derailments or failures. That was on single points of failure in a country with a lot less routes. (2 to be exact trans continental, with 1 choke point, even outside that point it could be difficult).\n\nWith Ukraine, there is a lot of track, and a lot of in a way 'Redundant' track in comparison.  What a lot of little delays, or a lucky hit will do is cause Russia's feed of supplies to slow down, either via re-routing, delays or damage. It's an attritional thing. However one, that must be frequent.  Causing 5 individual 1 hour delays might take a day to get back, even though the track is repaired. \n\nIf I was in Ukraine's position, I would be attempting to sabotage via Partisans / SOF/Artillery sections of track, even if not in use to wear down maintenance forces and cause delays, as well as looking at attacking via Artillery or other indirect means Rail yards, and turn outs. Even damaging sidings will help a lot more as it causes greater traffic management headaches.\n\nHowever such a strategy is not a short term one and done, but must be frequent to give a death of a thousand cuts.",

                "body": ">  with talks starting before Christmas,\n\nThere were several big articles [in the Economist](https://www.economist.com/ukraines-fateful-winter) on December 15th that profiled Zelensky and Zaluzhny and various other aspects of the war. Zaluzhny very explicitly asked for more armored vehicles and tanks.\n\n> General Zaluzhny, who is raising a new army corps, reels off a wishlist. \u201cI know that I can beat this enemy,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I need resources. I need 300 tanks, 600-700 IFVs [infantry fighting vehicles], 500 Howitzers.\u201d\n\nTo me, most of the requests in those articles seemed somewhat performative. The articles didn't have the same air of genuine desperation that accompanied many of the earlier requests for assistance, and seemed more focused on shaping the information space than on drumming up western support. Which would make sense if the Ukrainian leaders were already confident they'd receive the support they were asking for, and the public requests were just setting conditions for the west to be able to fulfill those requests. \n\nThere were reports of tension between Biden and Zelensky after Zelensky publicly criticized the support provided by the US and its partners back in July, which Zelenksy apparently went well out of his way to smooth over for obvious reasons. As part of that conversation, he likely agreed to coordinate his public requests with the Biden admin in advance of making them, so that he doesn't accidentally put the administration in an awkward position that ends up making it harder to support the Ukrainians. Meaning the actual decision was likely made before Zelensky and his team made any public requests for more AFVs/tanks.\n\nIt would also make sense that the articles were in part meant to contribute to a disinformation campaign intended to obfuscate their operational plans for the near future. Clearly the Ukrainians are husbanding resources in preparation for an offensive campaign either in the winter if the ground freezes for long enough, or in the spring if not.\n\n> \u201cWith this kind of resource I can\u2019t conduct new big operations, even though **we are working on one right now**,\u201d says General Zaluzhny. [...]\n\n> \u201cI know how many combat units I have right now, how many combat units I have to create by the end of the year\u2014and, most important, not to touch them in any way now. No matter how hard it is,\u201d says General Zaluzhny. [...] \u201cMay the soldiers in the trenches forgive me,\u201d says General Zaluzhny. \u201c**It\u2019s more important to focus on the accumulation of resources right now for the more protracted and heavier battles that may begin next year**.\u201d  [...]\n\n> Advancing 84km south through Zaporizhia province to Melitopol would suffice, says General Zaluzhny, because it would put HIMARS launchers within range of Russian supply lines to the peninsula, making the enemy\u2019s positions untenable\n\nThey do not outright state this, but seem to imply that they can't quite take Melitopol without more AFVs and tanks, which in turn means they can't retake Crimea. Notably, the terrain around Melitopol really does demand a strong armored push, so Zaluzhny suggesting that is his plan in the context of a discussion about the need for more armor strongly implies a connection between an offensive on Melitopol and the need for western tanks. \n\nConversely, the Pentagon has explicitly stated on multiple occasions that the Ukrainians already have everything they need to retake Crimea. So why the difference? Is the US lying? Are the Ukrainians? Or are there genuine differences of opinion between them about what is needed?My bet is disinformation built on careful splitting of hairs. Technically, the Ukrainians do have everything they need to retake Crimea, but it is equally true that they objectively will need the capabilities provided by western armor going forward. So technically neither the US nor the Ukrainians are lying. \n\nMy theory is that the Ukrainians are only connecting this request to the potential for a new offensive to mislead the Russians, by lulling them into a false sense of security. That would mean the Ukrainians currently have sufficient capabilities to drive the Russians out of the south, and are preparing to do so once the mud season isn't an issue. In the meantime, they want to give the impression to the Russians that they might not attack, or that they might not have sufficient resources if they do, in order to encourage them not to defend effectively against such an offensive. \n\nI also suspect Zaluzhny's real concern is that an offensive puts many of their armored assets at risk, and so even if their existing quantities are sufficient for the next campaign, they won't be sufficient to maintain subsequent offensives after that campaign if losses are high. The UAF will need to transition to NATO standard equipment eventually in any case, even if only to maintain an effective deterrent against Russia in the post-war era. As in, they aren't trying to hustle some extra gear from donors to make a quick buck or something, it's a perfectly valid and genuine request for support. It's just not a precondition for that next offensive, and Zelensky and co. only implied that connection as part of a broader campaign to mislead the Russians about the timing and direction of the planned attack.",

This happened because this was a cycle where US-China relations were very cordial (to a level where such a thing to sign the document ahead of the US even happened). There is a reason why the collective narrative of How/Who Lost China happened when PRC formed.  \n\nJust 20 years after top-level considerations of nuking China (Korean War) both entities came together again and this next cycle lasted 4 decades till today and changed the world essentially. \n\nIndia-US relations had best phase in 50s till early 60s (about a decade), then 70s, 80s were counter (one may call it neutral but it would be putting massive makeup on the term neutral). 90s saw India open up economically but politically it was still in bad cycle with India-Pakistan war and Nuclear test sanctions (which were just addons to even longer list of Dual-use tech sanctions from decades prior, even Russians couldn't help India with its peaceful Space program with things like Cryo tech due to US-Russian treaty obligations and India like China wasn't in contention for the ISS). \n\nBush in mid 00s ushered in the next positive cycle in US-India relations and it was again because India freaked out at the economic led power asymmetry with China. 2010s happened because India grew weaker relative to China, not because India really really wanted to do it this way.\n\n\nMeaning in net simplistic terms, US-China have had more number of years being on good pages of each other as State entities (with higher Peaks even) than US-India have had and this despite US nearly nuking the bejesus out of China and actually having fought with them in an active War. \n\nThis is not a US thing, this is an India thing. India doesn't like being told what to do (to a far far greater degree than possibly any country in the world). Meaning India-West relations were, are and going to be driven by India not what the West thinks of itself or India-West. \n\nIndia considers itself as a World Pole and this was so even when it was a nobody post Independence. The idea that when it's near parity to in real terms a Superpower Pole that it will just treat Western states as equal is farcical prior presumption. It will behave as a hegemon, regional or in any domain it's feasible because that would be the actual weight of its power & leverage.\n\nAnd because of the Governance System it has it means its people are far more involved in directing its State/Govt direction. \n\nThe Chinese Govt didn't publicize the 12 Land Border Ratifications it had done where only Once did they get more than 50% of the originally claimed territory, mostly they got around 5-20%. This was done to prevent grass root Nationalist pressure on the Govt because giving up historic Chinese territory is not something that Chinese people think is okay since CPC is transient in the historic Chinese context, they are just custodians of the Chinese Civilisation State and giving up historic lands isn't going to be treated with applause to put it mildly by the People.\n\nThere is a reason why India and Japan have a horrible track record of territorial dispute resolution. It is because the system they have narrows the operating room their Govt's have since people would create pressure and political parties will take advantage domestically. This is why India-China border is unresolved, it is because India simply could not accept even a deal that was favorable to India, twice.\n\n> I can- in this small Midwestern city\n\nYou conflate Indian background diaspora with India, that is your mistake.  \nIndia & Indians are not and won't be unsympathetic to people of Indian background around the world but there is a hierarchy to seeking Justice and getting Cathartic Justice trumps caring about the wellbeing of negligible scale 5th generation Indian background person.   \n\nIndia comes first, 10th and 99th and 999th and so on for Indians and Indian State not your midwestern Indian background doctor or chef. \n\n>  Rishi Sunak\n\nYou again do not understand how collective society level psyche works.  \nA person is irrelevant. UK and the West were collectively responsible and those State entities still exist today (& are even reaping benefits on the backs of their Western Colonialism phase) same for their collective societies.  \n\nRishi Sunak is not \"Indian\" and neither is he the UK or the West just like 1 Indian is not India. \nThe collective experience carries its own momentum and trumps all and with India the collective is powerful. As said it will not forget the experience and pain of its Western Coloiniams for 1000 years or till it has had Cathartic Justice because that is what all entities with trauma seek before they can truly move on. \n\n> Where is the real point of friction between India and the west here?\n\nThe 1st comment listed it. The Western Colonialism.\n\nIt was never reconciled, there was no Cathartic Justice. And no collective society can simply & casually move on with that sort of trauma and not do something about it. It will spill over, just the timing is unclear and for now it's as mentioned in latent condition because India is dealing with other higher priority issues, like surviving and making a living.\n\nTrade, economics, blocks are lower hierarchy things that can move the needle momentarily for sure but not on their own sufficient enough.\n\nThe scar of Colonialism trumps all this. \n\nThen there is the bit mentioned about India being a Pole. It is not going to tolerate US and Western Navies in Indian Ocean (& especially the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal). This is simply the Geo in Geopolitics. This on its own is sufficient even if there was no Historical baggage of Colonialism present.   \nIt is not just Ocean/Naval related, this has global strategic scale effects, India will be coming to Western Hemisphere and there is nothing US would be able to do at that time, other than what Asian countries currently do when US trots around them now, i.e. it will push back. \n\nThird is Civilisational. \nIndia is on a socio-cultural spectrum closer to China and other old Asian cultures/polities than the West. \nFamily and social values are collectivist with treating the Govt/State as a guardian/parent figure (this manifests itself in different ways and Westerners falsely lob India as Western values adjacent when the opposite is true).  \n\nIndian Civilisation paradigm is ultra malleable, it can accommodate & live alongside Western cultural tropes but fundamentally it is not part of Western Civilisation. This clash is at the fundamental society level. Indian thinking/psyche is not the same as Western collective psyche from a People's Perspective.\n\nThis is not related to the People just want prosperity & what's good for their children narratives, it's a nuanced version of this since obviously there are Universals like these since even Chinese or North Korean or Fijian persons think that. But not literally every human is the same in these society collectives, meaning after normalization for the parity traits, the differences are what matter and Indians are not Westerners.  \nThat also alone is enough of a difference. \n\nThese 3 are just some of the fundamental underlying difference-making paradigms. On top of this will be layers of things like trade, politics, etc.\n\nWest is not India's friend or ally and vice-versa. India is a Pole in waiting and it will behave like a Pole when it is so and that means West won't be the West as we understand in modern world, i.e. it's different when an entity is 40% of the planet and when same entity then is 15%. \n\nThe level of changes that happen with that is massive.",

Still better use of logistical capacity and manpower than on BMP-1 by miles.\n\nOn the plus both Marder and Bradley are much better protected than what Ukraine have for the role now. They weigh 10t+ more than BMP-2 for a reason, on top of blast protection lessons learn from War on Terror. ERA pack gives a chance to defeat some of the most prevalent Russian AT weapons too, especially in close fights.\n\nBut I expect them initially to fill reconnaissance support role shuttling scout teams fight for information if needed.

Still better use of logistical capacity and manpower than on BMP-1 by miles.</p>\n\n<p>On the plus both Marder and Bradley are much better protected than what Ukraine have for the role now. They weigh 10t+ more than BMP-2 for a reason, on top of blast protection lessons learn from War on Terror. ERA pack gives a chance to defeat some of the most prevalent Russian AT weapons too, especially in close fights.</p>\n\n<p>But I expect them initially to fill reconnaissance support role shuttling scout teams fight for information if needed. The problem as always will be they&#39;ll never get large enough number soon enough.</p>\n\n<p>AMX-10RC is... AMX-10RC, having a car with gun get to the fight is better than a tank failed to make it to the fight. That&#39;s the rationale, probably.</p>\n</div>",

You're right that the optics are superior (depending on version) but at the range where superior optics play the deciding factor, the 25mm gun on the bradley is going to have trouble with the armor on a T-72. We're talking 3-4km here. \n\nThe TOW missiles are interesting and will have no problem with a T-72, but the way we've seen both Russians and Ukrainians using TOWs makes me wonder what tactics the Bradley crews will deploy.

A Bradley is a big tall fat target that would silhouette itself against the Ukrainian steppe, and a 125mm tank round travels a lot faster than a TOW missile. How long can a Bradley afford to sit in the open shooting TOWs at T-72s?
