            "body": "> This could make it significantly more likely for sweden to send Gripen fighters. \n\nThat may be understating the case. There were reports back in August that the Ukrainians were already training on Gripens, and Gripen is ready to transfer aircraft on very short notice once given approval. [Gripen conversion training plus combat training takes around 20 weeks.](https://www.saab.com/newsroom/press-releases/2023/saab-completes-operational-training-of-brazilian-pilots-to-fly-gripen) (there have been around 25 weeks since the end of August, for reference). The prerequisite of NATO membership has been clear for a long time and it's also been clear that it would happen eventually, so presumably a lot of the prep work has already been completed and there shouldn't be much if any delay getting them deployed.\n\nIn terms of the context around numbers, I think we can infer from what's been made public that Sweden intends to transfer fighters from their air force's active inventory rather than new production, which is why they decided NATO membership was a prerequisite, so they can rely on NATO allies to backfill the gap that leaves in their air defenses in the short term. [Gripen has announced they already have hulls ready to replace any transferred to Ukraine, and they should be able to replace the lost inventory very quickly](https://www-aftonbladet-se.translate.goog/nyheter/a/O8wx8A/trycket-okar-om-jas-till-ukraina?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp). Sweden maintains around 100 Gripens in active service, with some additional number in conversion or awaiting decommissioning at any given point in time. The number of pilots Ukraine can allocate to Gripen training is probably substantially less than 100, so even if Sweden were contemplating the enormous act of charity that donating all 100 aircraft would be, the number Ukraine can meaningfully absorb is a greater limiting factor. So I doubt we will see more than 6-12 transferred in the first batch. But that should be enough to start making a difference in the tactical air situation.   \n\nPresumably they will be transferring some of their older C/D models (probably the one-seater C model) rather than the updated E/F models, which Sweden has only just begun to adopt over the past couple of years. From what I understand, most of the Cs have been updated to the E standard, so the only downside is that those air frames will have more hours on them than the more recently produced models. In any case, either C/D or E/F variants will give Ukraine access to a range of targeting pods, ECM pods, and precision weapons that are currently either not available or only available with limited capabilities because they have been retrofitted for compatibility with Ukraine's legacy Soviet-era air frames. Perhaps not as wide a range of options as F-16s offer, but still some *extremely* useful items like the Meteor air-to-air missile, which, while *very* expensive, almost certainly would allow the Ukrainians to push Russian fast aviation farther away from the front by holding them at risk of engagement with a powerful beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile, preventing them from dropping glide bombs with impunity. Considering the enormous quantity of munitions the VKS dropped on Avdiivka, that seems like a huge benefit.",

Its probably the *only* western missile currently in service that can go toe to toe with the R-37s launched from a MiG-31 (which should give the missile its best flight profile). On paper the R-37 should still have a slight range advantage, but not insurmountable by any means. The question is how many Meteors will Ukraine really get? Here I think we again see the real weakness in European arms manufacturing. MBDA has sold missile in the low hundreds to European partners, meanwhile Raytheon has sold *thousands* of -120s to those same partners in that same period of time. I think Germany recently bought 1k -120s just for itself. May suggest a future supply problem, especially if Europe has not yet gotten off its ass to start manufacturing more of them. Also begs the question, why hasn't the Meteor already been given the -120ER treatment for ground launch? Another interesting wrinkle. \n\nGripen could lead to a real transformation of the conflict, or could just as likely be another vaporwaffen. Assuming they even get sent at all, we shall see.

But were talking here about where the missiles will end up at the end of an engagement. More importantly, the R-37 has longer range (and much longer when guided by AWACS) and so will fire first. This lets the MiG, or whatever, maintain a high energy and altitude state. The issue with the -120C is that the gap was too large, and so the defending aircraft had to stop its attack before it could respond with its own missile. The Meteor closes that range gap significantly, and may open up the possibility that the UAF pilot can return their shot before defending, which is huge. BUT! because the R-37 has that range advantage theyre more likely to get off a first shot, to guide their missile in longer, and to *force* the UAF pilot to break lock and defend rather than guiding in their missile. And that typically will mean the defending aircraft has to abandon their altitude advantage and situational awareness. \n\nSo the flight characteristics of each missile in a low energy state at the end of a shot are important, but only insofar as you want to kill the enemy with that missile. Just as important is forcing your enemy to either go cold and defensive, which lets the attacker set up a second even more dangerous follow up shot, or forces the enemy to just pack it in and go home all together which grants you air superiority. \n\nMeteor narrows this gap, but doesn't solve it. Moreover if supplies sent to Ukraine remain limited, it may force UAF pilots into being more conservative with their shots and, as a result, abandoning attacks rather than risk wasting missiles. There are a hundred variables to consider, Meteor solves a few but not all.

                    "body": "> Without it, I dont know that the Gripen can give the Ukrainians more than the F-16 does\n\nI can think of three minor advantages. First, slightly lower operational costs per flight hour (something like $3000/hour compared to $5000/hour for an F-16, with later generation fighters like F-35s costing more on the order of $25-35k/hour), which is a nice bonus for a cash-strapped country and will make their limited air force budget stretch all that much further, but is of course only a marginal advantage over the Viper.\n\nSecond, rough runway capabilities, which although not strictly necessary given how many long, straight roads capable of serving as ad hoc runways and how many fully developed airports Ukraine has. But F-16s are apparently requiring the Ukrainians to refinish their existing air force runways, which otherwise are apparently not sufficiently smooth for the relatively delicate Vipers. Presumably that's forced the UAF to refinish multiple runways at multiple airports so that they don't tip off the Russians where the F-16s will be based, and may require them to do so on an ongoing basis. Although the costs of paving runways are of course trivial in the context of fighter aircraft with fixed costs in the tens of millions of dollars to purchase and millions more in variable costs to operate. The runway requirements will also force Ukraine to be prepared to refinish any runways quickly if the Russians drop cratering munitions.\n\nThird, the relative logistical simplicity of sourcing the planes and training from a single nation rather than a convoluted international alliance which struggles with coordination and capacity. Already, as I mentioned above, the Ukrainian pilots should have completed Gripen training while F-16 training remains ongoing, despite the actual commitment to deliver F-16s occurring *before* any Gripen commitment. That is in no small part because the F-16 timelines are limited by the US's preexisting training cycles. Similarly, the Ukrainians won't need to worry about scraping together enough comparable variant and vintage planes that can be logistically supported easily as a single type from multiple international partners. The Swedes will just provide a single tranche of planes built and maintained to a single common configuration standard, ensuring relative simplicity of maintenance and training for both pilots and ground crew. They also do not need to worry about a fragile multinational alliance collapsing without delivering sufficient capabilities, which seems like a real danger given the possible appointment of Geert Wilders as Dutch PM and the possible election of Donald Trump as US President, because the Netherlands and the US are the two most important nations currently supporting the F-16 program (yes, Denmark and other nations are participating but the bulk of the responsibility for training has fallen on the US and the Dutch, and the majority of planes committed for donation are coming from the Netherlands). \n\nBut yeah, those are minor advantages. The real advantage is simply quantity. Only a limited quantity of F-16s are available which Ukraine's partners are ready, willing, and able to hand over on short notice. Whatever that number is, it's pretty much guaranteed to be less than what Ukraine would want in an ideal universe. From the numbers being discussed publicly, Ukraine is unlikely to receive more than a handful of Vipers this year, and there are likely no more than 61 in total available for donation over the next several years. In that context, even a single squadron of Gripens (say approximately 12-24 aircraft) would be an incredibly valuable asset, especially if delivered sooner rather than later, during the period when only a handful of F-16s will be available.",

        "body": "On artillery ammunition and its availability, I recently read [this article](https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/02/west-underestimating-ukraines-artillery-needs/394392/) about Ukrainian artillery ammunition needs, and despite the tone of it being fairly gloomy I came away thinking that taking all available sources of ammunition the situation in 2024 might not be so desperate as I had thought it was. The article cites [this paper](https://admin.govexec.com/media/general/2024/2/paper_munition_ukraine_gressel_welsch_v3final.pdf) which I read through the magic of Google Translate. The paper asserts:\n\n* Expected production in the USA for 2024 is ~500,000 rounds of 155mm  \n* Expected delivery from the EU (including from overseas facilities owned by Nammo/Rheinmetall) for 2024 is ~800,000 of 155mm\n\nSo a potential (though of course, a very great deal relies on the US political process) of around 1.3 million rounds of 155mm from those two sources. The UK is also increasing its production - figures from the UK are extremely hard to come by but last time I attempted to derive a figure I settled on them having a target of something like ~400k rounds of 155mm for 2025, or about a third of what the US and EU plan to produce. I base that on a combination of our ammunition framework as originally signed targeting [100k \"large calibre\"](https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2020/11/30/bae-systems-gets-32-billion-deal-so-british-forces-can-reload/) rounds, which I assume is split evenly between 105mm and 155mm and the planned [eight fold increase in production capacity](https://des.mod.uk/des-places-new-order-to-increase-155mm-shells-stockpile-for-british-army/). Assuming we're roughly in the same place in our ramp-up journey then that might equate to something like ~150k rounds produced over the course of 2024. Then there's also the potential of [up to 800k large calibre rounds](https://www.thedefensepost.com/2024/02/19/czech-republic-artillery-rounds/) that Czechia is advertising having located and needing funding for, in total something like 2.25 million rounds potentially available in the \"nothing stops us doing this but political will\" sense.

I know Ukraine's got a horrifying mix now of 105mm/122mm guns and 120mm mortars in service filling the lighter end of the spectrum for tube artillery - is supply of munitions for those systems in a better place?

I can find almost no information at all.   \n* Similarly rocket artillery ammunition - I read that the US produces about 14,000 rounds of GMLRS annually but obviously M270/HiMARS aren't the only rocket artillery that Ukraine owns.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>On artillery ammunition and its availability, I recently read <a href=\"https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/02/west-underestimating-ukraines-artillery-needs/394392/\">this article</a> about Ukrainian artillery ammunition needs, and despite the tone of it being fairly gloomy I came away thinking that taking all available sources of ammunition the situation in 2024 might not be so desperate as I had thought it was. The article cites <a href=\"https://admin.govexec.com/media/general/2024/2/paper_munition_ukraine_gressel_welsch_v3final.pdf\">this paper</a> which I read through the magic of Google Translate. The paper asserts:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Expected production in the USA for 2024 is ~500,000 rounds of 155mm<br/></li>\n<li>Expected delivery from the EU (including from overseas facilities owned by Nammo/Rheinmetall) for 2024 is ~800,000 of 155mm</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So a potential (though of course, a very great deal relies on the US political process) of around 1.3 million rounds of 155mm from those two sources. The UK is also increasing its production - figures from the UK are extremely hard to come by but last time I attempted to derive a figure I settled on them having a target of something like ~400k rounds of 155mm for 2025, or about a third of what the US and EU plan to produce. I base that on a combination of our ammunition framework as originally signed targeting <a href=\"https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2020/11/30/bae-systems-gets-32-billion-deal-so-british-forces-can-reload/\">100k &quot;large calibre&quot;</a> rounds, which I assume is split evenly between 105mm and 155mm and the planned <a href=\"https://des.mod.uk/des-places-new-order-to-increase-155mm-shells-stockpile-for-british-army/\">eight fold increase in production capacity</a>. Assuming we&#39;re roughly in the same place in our ramp-up journey then that might equate to something like ~150k rounds produced over the course of 2024. Then there&#39;s also the potential of <a href=\"https://www.thedefensepost.com/2024/02/19/czech-republic-artillery-rounds/\">up to 800k large calibre rounds</a> that Czechia is advertising having located and needing funding for, in total something like 2.25 million rounds potentially available in the &quot;nothing stops us doing this but political will&quot; sense.

If Europe invests in its own security to a degree that it is completely self sufficient, then there is no point in allowing US primacy on the continent. Why host US military bases, why pay for US's MIC in that case?\n\nThere's also a lot of ways that security infrastructure could look like, France is really the only country that has paved its own way in terms of security. Would it make sense for other European countries to chart the same course? That's something that hearkens back to pre-WW2 security infrastructures, and the EU project was made to *counter* the effect of national projects.\n\nThe other option is a unified EU command, that has been opposed most prominently by UK(US's strongest ally), and also by US through its strong political lobbying. A unified EU MIC is not in the interest of US. Is it in the interest of EU? Sure one can argue that, but at the same time when there's so many pressures and bureaucratic stops to go through it's just not feasible, easier to rely on the US infrastructure.\n\nAs far as NATO spending is concerned, this is another point that is not very attractive to European members because the cost-benefits are low for most of them. If you are an European country, spending any money on NATO is overwhelmingly going to be invested into securing your borders, especially the closer you are to Russia. If you are USA, all of that spending is allowing you to work on security at global scale, which brings in bunch of economic benefits. Basically when US spends say 2% of its GDP on NATO, they get out a lot more out of it than just security. Poland, Estonia, or Portugal; or some other country isn't going to be using that funding to secure Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, fund security structures in Sudan, etc.",

Why host US military bases, why pay for US&#39;s MIC in that case?</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s also a lot of ways that security infrastructure could look like, France is really the only country that has paved its own way in terms of security. Would it make sense for other European countries to chart the same course? That&#39;s something that hearkens back to pre-WW2 security infrastructures, and the EU project was made to <em>counter</em> the effect of national projects.</p>\n\n<p>The other option is a unified EU command, that has been opposed most prominently by UK(US&#39;s strongest ally), and also by US through its strong political lobbying. A unified EU MIC is not in the interest of US. Is it in the interest of EU? Sure one can argue that, but at the same time when there&#39;s so many pressures and bureaucratic stops to go through it&#39;s just not feasible, easier to rely on the US infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>As far as NATO spending is concerned, this is another point that is not very attractive to European members because the cost-benefits are low for most of them. If you are an European country, spending any money on NATO is overwhelmingly going to be invested into securing your borders, especially the closer you are to Russia. If you are USA, all of that spending is allowing you to work on security at global scale, which brings in bunch of economic benefits. Basically when US spends say 2% of its GDP on NATO, they get out a lot more out of it than just security. Poland, Estonia, or Portugal; or some other country isn&#39;t going to be using that funding to secure Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, fund security structures in Sudan, etc.</p>\n</div>",

The situation practically begs for it... aside from the whole nuclear threats thing.</p>\n\n<p>Letting Russia destroy Ukraine will put European security in a much more precarious position. And Ukraine losing is a real possibility, even if Trump doesn&#39;t win. But there is a significant chance that Trump does win and that he acts in an anti-NATO way once he&#39;s in there.</p>\n</div>",

Wrote a small note about it yesterday. On the big picture, look, it's the job of certain people to prepare for downside risks. It's worth noting that the voices that are generally the loudest in saying Russia is ramping up industrial production and its war economy are also the loudest in saying the West has nothing to fear. That's simple ideological positioning. Further, as the Houthis are showing, there really doesn't need to be a whole lot of military might expended to sow chaos.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Outside of the big picture, understood this meeting to be mostly centered around boring technical matters of how to appropriate funds going forward and have better coordination. Wrote a small note about it yesterday. On the big picture, look, it&#39;s the job of certain people to prepare for downside risks. It&#39;s worth noting that the voices that are generally the loudest in saying Russia is ramping up industrial production and its war economy are also the loudest in saying the West has nothing to fear. That&#39;s simple ideological positioning. Further, as the Houthis are showing, there really doesn&#39;t need to be a whole lot of military might expended to sow chaos.

Now, the line between private enterprises and the state were always blurred in Russia, but it's probably been eradicated at this point. Still, as far as the state goes, Russia reintroduced damper payments to the refining sector in November, and backdated them to October. That cost the government $4.5bn last year per Platts as there was no MET setoff against it. So, the tax arbitrage you spoke about not only has existed in reverse for some time, it's fairly significantly inversely related. Most refining in Russia is done by integrated O&G companies, and the reverse excise tax for crude oil already creates a perverse environment for extraction relative to downstream (E&P is still more lucrative on an absolute basis, no arguments there.) Also, not to get too deep in the weeds here, but the huge tax overhaul that everyone was awaiting for 20 years started as of Jan 1 of this year. Under that new regime, there are a myriad of tax breaks related to capex for refiners. There are also major tax breaks for refiners exposed to sanctions, which is essentially all of them. Secondly, and this relates to the point you're making further down in relation to the Saudi's, if you strip out all the tax intricacies and high interest rate issues, crack spreads in Russia have never been higher and netbacks in the upstream sector have never been lower. The last netback rate on a nationwide weighted basis in December from Argus was $15/bbl. The crack purely for gasoline in Russia's new export markets is ~$25/bbl. So, whether you look at EBITDA, VCM or OCM, refineries on a purely operational basis have the highest margin business bar none. This is not only because of high cracks due to a tight market elsewhere, it's also because of decades of tough environmental standards that have caused mothballing of refineries in the West. Now, obviously the Red Sea attacks are affecting spreads both in dark and light products, but that's an extraneous event that's going to be temporary. If you look at moving windows through force majeure events, yes it increases market inefficiencies, but only for very temporary periods. All in all, to say, don't discount the cost basis of an export ban on refined products for the state, or for the integrated majors.",

Despite extreme measures by the government to keep the rouble from being sold at market value (including large foreign currency reserve injections) inflation is still extremely high and the value of the rouble has fallen precipitously, forcing the central bank to keep interest rates near 20%.

Much of their production now is simply refurbishing ancient Soviet kit and sending it to the battlefield, typically without modernizing it in any meaningful way. But they're limited in this as well, once that stockpile of old gear dries up they're going to have to devote way more capacity to building new equipment which will be unlikely to keep up with demand. In other words, Russia is likely to deplete most of their old equipment reserves in early 2026 and their military effectiveness will degrade significantly once that happens. \n\n>On top of that the civilian population enjoys the same level of comfort that it did before the war,\n\nIt does not, they've had to live with import substitution which has worked out alright, but they're paying more now for inferior products than they were pre-war. Many Russians have benefitted from the government dumping money on war production and paying exorbitant sums to get men to sign up for the war, but that doesn't come without a cost: as I've noted inflation is high and government spending is unsustainable (government is spending somewhere around 8% of GDP and 40% of the annual budget on the war), the government is rapidly depleting the sovereign wealth fund (meant to fund pensions, infrastructure improvements, etc) which took decades to build, Russian domestic manufacturing outside of war goods is in a terrible state, and Russia is going to be increasingly hurt by the transition to green energy in the coming decades as their economy is overly reliant on fossil fuels (which Putin should've focused on instead of trying to rebuild the Russian Empire).\n\n>So when is Russia going to start hurting and what form is that hurt going to take, in your opinion?\n\nIt's hard to argue Russia isn't *already* hurting from the war as I've noted. Sure they've been able to insulate the public from much of the costs so far, but they can only keep up the charade for so long. Even in a best case scenario for Russia where they win the war, do you have any idea how expensive reconstruction of the territories they capture is going to cost? How expensive rebuilding their military will be? Their oil and gas revenues, which are such a huge portion of the budget, aren't going to return to pre-war levels for a very long time since China isn't going to buy gas anywhere near the prices Europe was, or in the quantities they were, and building the pipeline infrastructure needed for that will cost tens of billions of dollars and take many years before they'll even start benefitting the budget again. And none of that even touches on how the war is exacerbating Russia's demographic nightmare. \n\nI think you're grossly underestimating just how costly this war has been and will be for Russia. No, the sanctions didn't cripple Russia overnight, but they're only going to get more painful over time, not less.",

Instead, asking him about Russian casualty numbers, or asking him about the performance or the army, etc. would be a better approach, because even if he makes up numbers or rhetoric for those--it's something that's much more relevant for the Russian audience, and thus it's harder to navigate around as specific information.\n\nMark Galeotti, also made a point on his recent podcast dealing with Navalny's death; that any reprisal from the west that would include say additional sanctions, or increased military aid, etc. in the name of Navalny's death would be a terrible approach, because if you want to tap into the Russian market that is concerned with the war; putting a bunch of things that will hurt Russia/Russians to Navalny's name does the opposite. Instead he gives an alternative into funding media outlets or organizations that report on things ordinary Russians are concerned with, not necessarily to report falsehoods(as the Russian approach) but to state the truth of the matter.

Hard to quantify that sort of thing, but we do have plenty of examples of it doing the opposite of its intent.

Either the hatch is closed and the driver is cooked, or the fire inside the turret is higher up.

Most likely not, since the turret changes position between two of the images, and the hatches are open. If the hatches were blown open, smoke should be pouring out of more areas and the entire turret roof should be deformed. \n\nAnother interesting detail is the side-skirt mounted ERA. It doesn't look like the US standard ERA package, but with the image provided it's hard to tell (I've also never seen a top down drone view of the ERA before, but it's definitely not the style used on the later A2 SEPs)",

The idea is that we can directly help Ukraine, protect their rear assets, free up Ukrainian resources, while keeping our intervention so low as to not lead to an escalation with Russia. The problem is that it is an impossible pipe-dream. \n\nSo the goal is to shoot down drones and missiles targeting Ukraine west of Kyiv. What does this require?\n\nIt requires early warning radars and air defense radars all the way to North-Western Ukraine, it requires mobile air defenses to cover a large area with thousands of possible approaches. NATO air defense is overwhelmingly aircraft-based. As opposed to ground-based. This means that the alliance will need to fly aircrafts deep into Ukrainian air space. \n\nThe distance from the closest NATO-based airbase in Rzeszow in Eastern Poland to Kyiv is 600 KM. 600!!! It is impossible to provide air defense to Kyiv without maintaining an airbase inside Ukraine.\n\nBut obviously that NATO airbase inside Ukraine would be a massive target for Russia, so the alliance would have to bring in a massive amount of men and equipment to protect, supply, maintain the airbase, to men and maintain the radar installations, to plan all the maneuvers, to deconflict and co-ordinate with Ukrainian air defense and air force. We are talking about tens of thousands of boots on the ground.\n\nAnd then what, after expending billions and at least a year building these air defense installations, you are there to just shoot down drones and missiles. OK.\n\nBut what about Russian aircraft (carrying missiles) that are approaching the Ukrainian border, do you shoot them down? Or do you just shoot down the missiles it launches? How do you make sure accidents don't happen?\n\nWhat do you do with Russian air defense assets in Russia and Belarus that are very much willing to shoot down your aicrafts flying inside Ukraine? Do you leave them be? Do you actually destroy them so you could carry out your mission of shooting down missiles and drones?\n\nThe issue with the \"very limited intervention\" is that even this very limited intervention requires a massive direct effort to have even the basic capability of defending Kyiv from above. If you don't target Russian aircrafts, radars and air defense installations, you are going to get shot down. If you do target them, you are very much not in a very limited intervention-mode anymore.\n\n  \nThe reason many people have advocated for such a limited no-fly-zone is because they absolutely expect and want the war to escalate. Once this limited intervention gets bombed, the hope is that the West has no other option but to actually get involved in full scale.\n\nI am for a total intervention. I think NATO should prepare its forces and make Russia the ultimatum to withdraw from Ukraine or NATO will do it for them. I personally think that Russia should be destroyed, they have forfeited their sovereign right to foreign policy by being genocidal imperialists.\n\nBut for the love of everything that is sacred, let's make it as a conscious foreign policy decision and prepare accordingly, and not get dragged into the war unprepared in the most useless way possible.",
