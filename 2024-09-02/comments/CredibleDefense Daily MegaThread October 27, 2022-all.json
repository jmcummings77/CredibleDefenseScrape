Biden has already said as much and I agree with his assessment, this is now an ideological war between democracy and fascism that will set the tone for the 2020s. America views defending Ukraine to maximalist positions as vital for these reasons, 1: To restore US diplomatic integrity by showing deep commitment to its allies and to democratic peace theory 2: To reinforce the post-ww2 world order that largely saw the use of war for territorial conquest as discredited, and to reinforce democracy globally. 3: Prevent the normalization of nuclear blackmail.\n\nA failure in the first category (IE, changing course on support for Ukraine) means that the US will lose its position as a leading state among world democracies. A failure in the second category (IE, Russia taking territory for Ukraine in a peace settlement) could lead to a rise in global fascism and a return to pre-ww2 global order. A failure in the third category (allowing Russia to use nuclear weapons) dramatically increases the odds of limited nuclear war in the future, and will certainly lead to a new nuclear arms race and rise of nuclear proliferation.",

OP Desert Storm notwithstanding, the whole reason casualty estimates were so high was due to expectations of difficulty breaking through the Saddam Line (which many thought could take weeks to months, and tens of thousands of US mil casualties). \n\nThe fact that they've made breakthroughs at all is a pretty strong testament to UAF effectiveness, the entire Russian operational scheme of maneuver since late July was to reinforce the Kherson bridgehead and make such breakthroughs impossible. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Russia's artillery advantage is still decisive\n\nWhile repeated ad nauseam, Russia artillery advantage needs to be taken with a grain of salt. \n\nIn terms of paper strength, Ukraine brigades actually possess identical artillery numbers as Russian brigades (which are the building blocks of their BTGs). When adding up the equivalent of maneuver battalions, the Russians supposedly entered the war with \\~120 BTGs. The UAF had \\~30 active and reserve brigades before the war started (not counting TDF, who don't possess arty), which comes out to \\~90-120 maneuver battalions (number of maneuver battalions vary per brigade type). \n\nWhere the Russians did have an advantage was operational level artillery units. Both sides had brigades of artillery (usually heavier calibers, more rocket types) attached to higher commands. The Ukrainians only had four of those, one for each of their four operational commands. In comparison, the Russians had one for every CAA/Tank Army/Army Corps, a hell of a lot more than only four. With those, the Russians would likely have exceeded the UAF with tube arty.  \n\nEffective strength obviously differed from TO&E, but we'll not know for years to come what the actual unit by unit readiness levels of both sides were before this war, let alone as it progressed. In comparison to other known poor readiness rates, I think its fair to assume Russia entered this war with fewer tubes and rocket launchers than they were supposed to have, and have lost A LOT since it's started. The Ukrainians too would have lost many, but its unlikely they lost as much as the Russians. \n\nRealistically, artillery dominance would likely come down to two things unrelated to total numbers: strategic level logistics, tactical and operational level logistics, and massing. \n\nFor strategic level supply, the big issue was fire rates in this war are OUSTANDINGLY HIGH. That was true of most wars, the 1973 Yom Kippur War also astounded NATO and Warsaw Pact to the point everything had to be rewritten to consider that combat units would fire more than \"the book\" said they were supposed to. But this war has absolutely blown away those revised estimates too, neither side are exercising much in the way of fire discipline. For the Ukrainians, that meant they exhausted their supplies of various tube and rocket artillery much earlier than they anticipated, which was the reason they were augmented by 105 and 155mm NATO artillery, to feed in additional gun types so they could assist with ammo, while also using various NATO countries to give up their existing COMBLOC ammo. Suffice to say, Ukraine suffers from this problem more than Russia. \n\nLogistics at the tactical and operational level means the ability to get arty rounds to the battlefield. Russia did this HORRIBLY in the first phase, which is why they were rightly accused of barely using combined arms warfare outside static battlefields (attempted sieges). They got better in the next phases, especially the Donbas fighting when they suffered very little attrition to their supply lines, which were strategically very close to Russia, and tactically close enough to the rail stations that they build a large number of badly sited ammo supply points that were targeted in when the \"HIMARS O'Clock\" interdiction campaign started. Prior to that, the Russians definitely outsupplied the Ukrainians locally, who had exhausted the stores of ammo left for OC-E in case of war, and were reliant on ammo being shipped to the ass end of Ukraine from other parts of the country or from NATO countries, a VERY long supply line. \n\nLastly, there comes massing. Russia massed most of its forces in Ukraine in the Donbas. Those units came with their artillery. Ukraine did not mass most of its forces in the Donbas, it tried various counteroffensives in other fronts (Kharkiv, Kherson) trying to unbalance the Russians, which worked to some degree. However, if UAF units aren't there, their arty isn't either. The UAF compensated by sending additional TDF brigades to the fight. Unfortunately, TDF doesn't have artillery. Because the UAF was doing a positional defense, they were required to defend everywhere, especially since they didn't know where the Russians would attack. Because the Russians were on the attack, they could mass units at the attack point, which meant they could mass their guns too. And lastly, because the battle of the Donbas was a salient battle, with the UAF inside it, it meant the Russians were surrounding them, which meant even more Russian arty batteries could range any given point than normal. \n\nHowever, none of those three factors favor Russia in the Kherson front. Their overall supply of artillery ammo isn't finite and will become a factor sooner than later (though maybe not at the moment). The Russian supply lines are longest there, and hampered greatly by the interdiction of the Dnieper crossing points. And while they're massing, so are the UAF, likely more than the Russians are.",

Add another \\~30,000 or so (at any given time) for L/DNR, plus another \\~3,000 Wagner mercs, and maybe \\~5,000 Chechens. But let's be EXTREMELY generous and say the Russians had 200,000 in Ukraine, which they didn't, but let's just be extremely liberal and give them that. \n\nThe UAF started out with roughly \\~240,000 troops in all branches of their armed forces, not counting paramilitary forces who also perform combat roles. After the war started, they've gained multiple hundreds of thousands more by activating their reserve and taking volunteers to form the Territorial Defense Force, which doubled the number of maneuver brigades the UAF possessed. Yep, most of them weren't trained, but as [this article shows](https://mwi.usma.edu/time-is-not-on-kyivs-side-training-weapons-and-attrition-in-ukraine/) that didn't stop the UAF from sending them to the front lines. \n\nThe fact of the matter is that the Russians are notoriously undermanned in Ukraine, to the point every time they reinforce one location they weaken another. A significant portion of the line is barely manned at all (though even the UAF doesn't have the manpower and units needed to come close to manning a front line that was nearly 1,000 km long until losing Kharkiv).  \n\nThe Donbas offensive April-Sep favored Russia mostly because they reduced other fronts in the theater to economy of force defensive ops while massing in the Donbas, while the UAF sent only the bare minimum initially (though heavily reinforced it in July-August after losses), as the UAF was keen on performing counteroffensives in Kharkiv (April-May) and Kherson (May-June) concurrently while defending the Russian main effort in the Donbas. \n\nAnd even then, as Michael Kofman and others had pointed out, the Russian superiority was often localized. The UAF don't know exactly where the Russians are going to attack and couldn't mass in any one location unless they sacrificed others (like when they foolishly held Severondonetsk). By being on the offensive, the Russians control where they want to attack, numerous locations all around the overall salient, which meant they had the luxury of massing whenever they wanted. That led to situations where sometimes the overall force comparison might be somewhat equal but the Russians might have a localized advantage of up to 10:1.\n\nCount the brigades: \n\n[Jomini of the West map, Donbas, Jun 27](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FWTMGKvX0Ag8n5H?format=jpg&name=4096x4096) \n\n[Jomini of the West map, Donbas, Aug 16](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FaUv6-RWYAAQN8u?format=jpg&name=4096x4096) \n\nAnd mobilization does help, making the decision to do it on Feb 24 is a chief reason the Ukrainians are still in the fight.
