Natalia Humeniuk, the head of the press center of the Southern Defense Forces, announced this on the &quot;We Are Ukraine&quot; television channel.  </p>\n\n<p>She noted that Ukrainian fighters understand the military potential of the enemy in the south and are working to destroy it. &quot;We are not inclined to underestimate the enemy; we understand the specifics of the formation of this group (in the south), we understand its capabilities and potential, and we are methodically working to minimize these capabilities and possibilities,&quot; said Humeniuk.  </p>\n\n<p>She explained that this is what the Ukrainian counteroffensive entails, which is already underway, namely, reducing the enemy&#39;s capabilities.  </p>\n\n<p>&quot;This is precisely the same counteroffensive that everyone is waiting for, when it will start, when we can finally remove, when we can show and reveal. And it is quietly progressing with small but confident steps. And it is progressing to the point where the enemy&#39;s capabilities are being destroyed: ammunition depots disappear, equipment assembly points explode, and personnel concentration areas are targeted. And even this somewhat disorganized group (of the enemy) becomes completely scattered,&quot; explained the representative of the Southern Defense Forces.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

        "body": "**The Milley Doctrine**\n\n>On the plane ride home, I asked Chairman Milley about the frustration I hear back in Washington about his very public and not very optimistic prognoses for Ukraine\u2019s military. Since the fall, he had been saying that Ukraine could not win this war militarily and that it would, at some point, have to come to the negotiating table. (Though, to be fair, he has also said that Russia can\u2019t win the war militarily, either.) \u201cIt feels like Milley\u2019s analysis is our policy,\u201d one D.C. think tank chief complained to me privately. \u201cWhy are you so negative publicly?\u201d they wondered aloud, as if addressing the Chairman himself. \u201cWhether it\u2019s true or not, how does it help? What are you trying to achieve with the negative comments? I\u2019m glad he\u2019s been told privately to knock it off.\u201d\n\n>\u201cWell, first of all, I don\u2019t think in terms of optimist or pessimist or defeatist, I think in terms of realist,\u201d Milley said\u2014or, rather, shouted over the scream of the engines. \u201cI\u2019m a soldier and I try to deal in realistic analysis of a lot of the military factors that go into the conduct of battle and war. It\u2019s based off of intelligence analysis. I\u2019m not trying to project defeatism or optimism. I\u2019m just trying to be realistic. I personally think that the Ukrainians have done extraordinarily well. I think the Ukrainians have fundamentally defeated the Russian army.\u201d (According to his staff, it\u2019s not just intelligence that Milley uses to understand what is happening in the world. A voracious reader who starts his day by reading the morning press at the very #thistown hour of 4 a.m., he also supplements his information diet with a healthy, steady dose of Twitter.)\n\n>Think about that, Milley continued. \u201cHere\u2019s a country the size of Ukraine, and, over the last year, from a cold start in February of last year, they have prevented the Russian army, the\u00a0Russian military, from achieving their strategic objectives. That\u2019s an incredible military feat, it really is.\u201d\u00a0\n\n>We were sitting in the back of the plane, the A.F.P. reporter and I on the couch, Chairman Milley at his desk. We finally had a moment to speak to him on the record before he had to hop on the phone with the head of the French military and talk Sudan. We had been treated to a long and off-the-record explanation, complete with a military map, of what had happened in the first year of the war and what awaited Ukraine in the coming months.\u00a0\n\n>After the conversations I had at the Ramstein forum, though, it was hard to fault Milley for being pessimistic. Various Western officials, both military and civilian, worried aloud about Ukraine\u2019s spring offensive. Russia has built a web of trenches so massive, they can be\u00a0seen from space. Any military analyst will tell you that taking territory is a far costlier proposition than defending it, but the chatter at Ramstein was that Ukraine was about to walk into a buzzsaw. If Ukraine attacked to the southeast toward the Azov Sea, as has been widely and\u00a0publicly\u00a0speculated, aiming to retake Melitopol and cut Russian supply lines between Crimea and mainland Russia, the country would be going after some of the most heavily fortified\u2014and most strategically important\u2014Russian installations. This breaching operation, as it is known in the military, is one of the hardest and bloodiest maneuvers to pull off in general, and the Ukrainians have already been bled for over a year of brutal fighting. One Ukrainian journalist approached me on the patio at Ramstein and, wringing his hands, asked me what the talk was in Washington. What would run out first, he wondered aloud, America\u2019s appetite to support Ukraine\u2014or Ukrainian men of military age? Because the latter scenario, he added, was fast approaching.\n\n>Most reporting has focused on astronomical Russian casualties, but some U.S. officials have estimated that Ukraine has lost some 200,000 soldiers to death and injury in the last 14 months. The fighting ahead would be even bloodier. The U.S. military generally prepares for a casualty ratio of 3:1 when planning a breaching operation, with the attacking side bearing the brunt of the bloodshed. But one official at Ramstein told me it might be even worse: 50,000 Ukrainian casualties in the first two months alone. Another speculated that half of both armies in the area of the offensive would be wiped out in a matter of months. And would Ukraine even succeed? Everyone hoped so, but the jitters were palpable. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to the next meeting [of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group] in June when we have some results from the Ukrainian offensive,\u201d the European official told me.\u00a0\n\n>**The Rules-Based Order**\n\n>As we approached Andrews in the early evening, I asked Milley if he thought Ukraine could win the war according to their own definition of victory, and the Chairman, who speaks in tomes, was determined to strike a more optimistic tone, especially after my first question. \u201cIf Putin wins, if Putin is successful, then China learns a lesson, Iran learns a lesson, and the rules-based order goes up in smoke,\u201d he said. He then noted that this rules-based order\u2014the status quo that Putin and\u00a0Xi Jinping\u00a0have endlessly critiqued\u2014has helped avoid the sort of great-power war that consumed the world in the last century.\u00a0\n\n>\u201cFor Ukraine, it\u2019s an existential fight for their own freedom,\u201d he noted. \u201cBut for NA\u0422O in Europe and for for the United States and other countries, it\u2019s about the rules. That\u2019s the purpose. So then the question becomes, okay, if that\u2019s what it\u2019s about, how do you know when you win and what is winning? Winning, according to President Biden and all of the senior political leaders of Europe, is that Ukraine, at the end of the day, must remain a free, independent, sovereign country with its territory intact. If that is true, if that happens, then the rules-based order is upheld and Putin is defeated.\u201d\u00a0\n\n>\u201cOf course, we want Ukraine to win,\u201d he went on. \u201cWe\u2019re not sinking billions upon billions upon billions of dollars in Ukraine just to think otherwise. We want them to win. They\u00a0must\u00a0win. And we are going to do everything we need to do to help them win because the purpose is so important to the United States and NATO and Europe.\u201d\n\nGreat article.

Obviously nothing close to 100% can serve, but there are plenty of historical examples of nations sustaining multiple times as many casualties as Ukraine has sustained and still able to fight.

And so the founding team endeavored to build our business around elite, genre-defining journalists\u2014pros in the prime of their careers who saw their subjects and audiences at an eye-to-eye level.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/dylan-byers-julia-ioffe-puck-news/\">https://www.thewrap.com/dylan-byers-julia-ioffe-puck-news/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2021/08/04/puck-media-startup\">https://www.axios.com/2021/08/04/puck-media-startup</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-09-13/a-new-media-startup-treats-reporters-like-social-media-influencers\">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-09-13/a-new-media-startup-treats-reporters-like-social-media-influencers</a> \n(note: &quot;like social media influencers&quot; here appears to be a clickbaity way of saying what&#39;s in the story-of-puck quote above)</p>\n\n<p>tl;dr - new media outlet focused on hiring high-quality veteran reporters who produce quality content to attract subscribers willing to pay $100-$250 a year.

Ordnance goods (ammunition, artillery shells, mines, assorted explosives) provided amounted to 53 percent of total domestic consumption. One item typical of many was a tire plant that was lifted bodily from the Ford Company's River Rouge Plant and transferred to the USSR. The 1947 money value of the supplies and services amounted to about $11.3 billion ($180 billion in the 2020 money value).\n\nOh yeah. \n\nWe don't believe that Russia is incapable of mass-producing most weapons. We know that they are incapable of mass-producing most weapons. \n\nThey rely on Iranian drones. They need Iranian shells. They begged Egypt for shells and powder and they try to get North Korean supplies. \n\nThey can produce / refurbish around 400 tanks a year. They lost 1900+ in one year. \n\nWhy do you think Wagner is begging the MOD for more shells?",

So in short, there are many parallels which only work to a limited extent, as the comparisons utterly break down at one point or another.\n\nWinter War: A bombastic Russian invasion of a neutral and smaller neighboring country in poor weather conditions breaks down and suffers horrendous losses, particularly to on-road ambushes. Volunteers from around the world flock to fight for the underdog, but having a limited impact. Parallels are strong for the initial month of the war, but since the size discrepancy is not 40:1, but 4:1, as Ukraine possesses much more heavy equipment than Finland ever did and as Ukraine receives a lot of Western aid, instead of the underdog having to succumb to the sheer mass of Russian invasion, manages to significantly extend the war and the parallels don't really work anymore.\n\nFirst Chechen War: goes a bit like the Winter War with more urban fighting, but with an even greater size discrepancy, but also an indescribably poor Russian army morale and leadership wise. Even worse than the current war, by a significant margin in fact. But these were two Soviet-tradition armies, with the defender in large part resorting to a more partisan/guerilla approach. But Chechnya lacks the population, geographic depth, equipment and foreign aid that Ukraine has. And Russia is despite their poor showing much more capable than they were in Chechnya.\n\nWorld War II Eastern front: The ebbs and flows of the war are reminiscent of that war. The invader has initial success in maneuver warfare, but does not manage the initial goals and is pushed away from the capital. The defender launches a counter-offensive, and then the invader goes again, and then the defender again. But the sheer scope of World War II was just so much greater, in men, distance, equipment, ammunition expenditure, death.... that the parallels break down. Also operation Barbarossa was certainly more successful than whatever the Russians did. I just wonder why Hitler didn't ask Stalin for a truce in 1943 on the Dniepr line. After all Germany still occupied swaths of Soviet territory - must've been winning.\n\nSecond Nagorno-Karabakh War: drones, some new top-end technology and a bunch of Soviet-era legacy hardware. High intensity warfare, highly recorded (though perhaps under-reported). But it \"was\" short and much more limited in scale, by small countries.\n\nThe future: drones, real-time targeting, EW, cyber attacks, hybrid warfare everywhere.

One is accurate and timely intelligence. Two is accurate mid-range weaponry.   \n\n\nRussia has cruise missiles for long range attacks, but those can only ever have a limited amount of effect on the battlefield. Russia is severely deficient in intelligence and monitoring and the ability for units near the front to act on it.   \n\n\nAs much as Kherson was a bit of Ukraine slamming their head against a wall until the camel's back finally broke, it would have never gone anywhere if it weren't for having intelligence and accurate rockets and artillery to take advantage of the intelligence and shape the Russian's ability to support their troops.   \n\n\nOn the other hand, Kharkiv was another success for intelligence, mobility, new western training and taking advantage of their opponents weaknesses.   \n\n\nRussia has improved their situation, sure. Without Kherson they are now able to more densely man the entire front, and they have layers of mines and dug in defenses. So it will be no cake walk for Ukraine, thats for sure. But I just wanted to point out that the situation is also relatively better for Ukraine than it is for Russia. Unfortunately, though as we know, defending is easier than going on offense.
