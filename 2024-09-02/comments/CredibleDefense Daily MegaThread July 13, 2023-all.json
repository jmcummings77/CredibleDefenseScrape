Most have no status under Russian law.</p>\n\n<p><strong>And Russia is planning to hold possibly thousands more. A Russian government document obtained by The Associated Press dating to January outlined plans to create 25 new prison colonies and six other detention centers in occupied Ukraine by 2026.</strong></p>\n\n<p>In addition, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree in May allowing Russia to send people from territories with martial law, which includes all of occupied Ukraine, to those without, such as Russia. This makes it easier to deport Ukrainians who resist Russian occupation deep into Russia indefinitely, which has happened in multiple cases documented by the AP.</p>\n\n<p>Many civilians are picked up for alleged transgressions as minor as speaking Ukrainian or simply being a young man in an occupied region, and are often held without charge. Others are charged as terrorists, combatants, or people who \u201cresist the special military operation.\u201d <strong>Hundreds are used for slave labor by Russia\u2019s military, for digging trenches and other fortifications, as well as mass graves.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Torture is routine, including repeated electrical shocks, beatings that crack skulls and fracture ribs, and simulated suffocation. Many former prisoners told the AP they witnessed deaths.</strong> A United Nations report from late June documented 77 summary executions of civilian captives and the death of one man due to torture.</p>\n</div>",

Bulgaria has significant reserves of Soviet armored vehicles, but a lot may need significant refurbishment. Further swaps/deals may help bring the Bulgarian military in line with NATO standards. We&#39;ll have to see if this prospective deal goes through first, however.</p>\n</div>",

India is presenting itself as a key partner in Asia for Washington and its allies as China asserts itself over Taiwan. To draw New Delhi closer they are offering sophisticated weapons platforms and investments. \n\n>The two countries are already building Scorpene submarines and the last of six boats being manufactured by India\u2019s Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Ltd will be ready early next year.

The US is not a signatory of the Oslo Convention on Cluster Munition (neither are Russia or Ukraine, for that matter). Opposition from the US, Russia, China, Brazil, India and Pakistan is actually the main reason why the Oslo Convention doesn't have the same internationally-recognised (and generally good compliance) of the CCWC.\n\nThe US largely wants to dispose of these *particular* cluster munitions because they developed better ones, there are some limits to their use that were legally imposed years ago which are tied to failure rates, and because, logistical concerns aside (e.g. easing pressure off other ammunition types) there's a huge stockpile that's nearing the end of its useful life, the US isn't involved in any war where it can use them, and you can't just leave explosive ammo lying around, you have to dispose of it *some* way. \n\nSome of the US' allies are obviously going to play the concern game because they *are* signatories of the Oslo convention, but that's largely in order to appease their internal audience. I've written about this before so I'm not gonna bore y'all with it but like its elder cousin, the Ottawa Treaty, the one about antipersonnel mines, the Oslo Convention has a complicated standing, because it was not developed within the UN's disarmament framework. I think the war in Ukraine will confine this sort of treaties to quasi-irrelevance. Bad press was a good impetus for signing the treaty back when it was largely about foreign wars from overseas, but not when it hits (no pun intended) close to home. And, since it falls outside the scope of established UN monitoring and enforcement mechanisms (which are themselves fairly feeble) these treaties are largely enforced through angry op-eds from NGO leads and passive-aggressive letters from foreign ministers -- nasty during peacetime but nothing anyone loses sleep over in a war.",

Opposition from the US, Russia, China, Brazil, India and Pakistan is actually the main reason why the Oslo Convention doesn&#39;t have the same internationally-recognised (and generally good compliance) of the CCWC.</p>\n\n<p>The US largely wants to dispose of these <em>particular</em> cluster munitions because they developed better ones, there are some limits to their use that were legally imposed years ago which are tied to failure rates, and because, logistical concerns aside (e.g. easing pressure off other ammunition types) there&#39;s a huge stockpile that&#39;s nearing the end of its useful life, the US isn&#39;t involved in any war where it can use them, and you can&#39;t just leave explosive ammo lying around, you have to dispose of it <em>some</em> way. </p>\n\n<p>Some of the US&#39; allies are obviously going to play the concern game because they <em>are</em> signatories of the Oslo convention, but that&#39;s largely in order to appease their internal audience. I&#39;ve written about this before so I&#39;m not gonna bore y&#39;all with it but like its elder cousin, the Ottawa Treaty, the one about antipersonnel mines, the Oslo Convention has a complicated standing, because it was not developed within the UN&#39;s disarmament framework. I think the war in Ukraine will confine this sort of treaties to quasi-irrelevance. Bad press was a good impetus for signing the treaty back when it was largely about foreign wars from overseas, but not when it hits (no pun intended) close to home. And, since it falls outside the scope of established UN monitoring and enforcement mechanisms (which are themselves fairly feeble) these treaties are largely enforced through angry op-eds from NGO leads and passive-aggressive letters from foreign ministers -- nasty during peacetime but nothing anyone loses sleep over in a war.</p>\n</div>",

This should be achieved through the ASAP, which responds directly to the Council&#39;s call to deliver ammunition urgently, and if requested missiles too, to Ukraine and to help member states restock their supplies.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20230711IPR02613/meps-approve-plans-to-provide-more-ammunition-for-ukraine\">https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20230711IPR02613/meps-approve-plans-to-provide-more-ammunition-for-ukraine</a></p>\n\n<p>This plan has been talked about for months, and it is still not in action, it is waiting for approval from the European Council. </p>\n\n<p>So. Very. Sluggish.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "Further reporting, this time from the Washington Post, of anger at Zelensky's tweet\n\n**Zelensky\u2019s angry tweet on NATO membership nearly backfired** - The Ukrainian president\u2019s fiery response to NATO\u2019s conditions-based pledge in Vilnius touched off a scramble \u2014 and brief consideration of watering down what Kyiv would be offered, officials said    \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/07/13/zelensky-ukraine-nato-invitation/    \nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20230713181642/https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/07/13/zelensky-ukraine-nato-invitation/\n\n> JAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s confrontational tweet this week challenging NATO leaders on the glacial pace of his war-torn country\u2019s admission into the alliance so roiled the White House that U.S. officials involved with the process considered scaling back the \u201cinvitation\u201d for Kyiv to join, according to six people familiar with the matter.\n\n> Ultimately, the United States and its allies agreed they would preserve the declaration\u2019s language as eventually presented Tuesday at the NATO summit in Vilnius, Lithuania. The declaration lacks a timeline for Ukraine\u2019s membership into the bloc but was the product of hard-won efforts to move the Biden administration and other European leaders to grant more-specific offers to Kyiv amid Russia\u2019s ongoing invasion.\n\n> The incident illustrates the frustration inside NATO with Zelensky\u2019s pressure tactics, where even some of his strongest backers questioned this week whether he was serving Ukraine\u2019s interests with his outburst. At the same time, the backroom scramble it set off shows how little the alliance can do about it: NATO nations are all-in on the war effort, and many member states remain deeply sympathetic to Zelensky\u2019s demands for a deeper level of support. And while many officials expressed annoyance with the tweet, there was an understanding that the leader of an embattled nation must demonstrate he will do anything to extract the maximum on behalf of his people.\n\n> Zelensky\u2019s missive, launched as NATO leaders were gathering for the two-day summit, denounced as \u201cunprecedented and absurd\u201d what was then a draft of the membership language.\n\n> The Ukrainian leader\u2019s public rebuke of the alliance stunned those assembled in the summit venue, an exposition hall on the outskirts of the Lithuanian capital, leaving the U.S. delegation \u201cfurious,\u201d according to one official familiar with the situation. Like others, the person spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive talks.\n\n> Ambassadors, ministers and other senior policymakers held informal talks about how the alliance should respond. U.S. officials raised the possibility of revisiting or striking the passage to which Zelensky had so forcefully objected: \u201cWe will be in a position to extend an invitation to Ukraine to join the Alliance when Allies agree and conditions are met,\u201d according to European officials involved in the negotiations.\n\n> Although Washington has given Kyiv billions of dollars worth of military aid and other support since the war began early last year, President Biden has favored a cautious approach, fearful that doing too much too quickly could risk escalating the crisis and drawing NATO into direct conflict with Russia. Biden attended the Vilnius summit with his secretary of state, Antony Blinken, who has traveled on to Jakarta, Indonesia, for a meeting of foreign ministers from Southeast Asia.\n\n> At a summit in Bucharest, Romania, in 2008, Ukraine and Georgia were offered eventual NATO membership, provided they fulfilled a slew of requirements first. Ukrainians complain that 15 years later, they are still facing a host of reform demands, many of which aren\u2019t specific.\n\n> A U.S. official familiar with the conversations acknowledged that revisions to the declaration had been considered, saying the Biden administration was sensitive to Zelensky\u2019s concerns and had hoped they might address them somehow.\n\n> Three other senior policymakers, however, two of whom were direct participants in the talks, said their strong perception was that the United States was getting ready to water down the document\u2019s language \u2014 to make it less welcoming to a speedy Ukrainian accession to the alliance.\n\n> \u201cSome wanted to withdraw the reference to \u2018invitation,\u2019\u201d or find another place to put that word, said one of the senior policymakers, a NATO diplomat who took part in the talks.\n\n> Spokespeople for the White House and the Ukrainian presidency did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\n> Another senior NATO diplomat who took part in the frantic negotiations said that, although \u201cseveral people\u201d supported removing the phrasing that had upset Zelensky, the U.S. delegation \u201cdid not specifically want to take that promise\u201d of an invitation out of the declaration. There was a consensus that reworking the document would delay its release and, \u201cin the end, those most concerned about the Ukrainian reaction came to the conclusion that it would be better to stick with the text\u201d as drafted.\n\n> \u201cIt sends a very clear and strong message,\u201d this person said, \u201cboth to Ukraine and Russia.\u201d\n\n> **French President Emmanuel Macron, backed by the Central European and Baltic nations, pushed to keep the language originally agreed upon.** Those leaders saw it as the strongest possible offer to Ukraine given reluctance by the United States, Germany and others to go further for fear that doing so would draw the alliance into a direct confrontation with Russia. NATO leaders also announced wide-ranging packages of military assistance for Kyiv.\n\n> \u201cWe landed. The outcome was the best possible,\u201d the diplomat said.\n\n> By the time NATO ambassadors formally discussed how to respond to Zelensky\u2019s tweet, the United States was back on board with the declaration\u2019s original wording, the policymakers said.\n\n> Inside the leaders\u2019 room, there was more back and forth with advisers than is typical for these types of highly scripted summits, officials said. At one point, the White House national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, entered the room and pulled Biden away from the table, appearing to be talking the president through something, one official said.\n\n> Zelensky later softened his tone, expressing gratitude during the in-person meetings in Vilnius and urging for as speedy a Ukrainian accession to the alliance as possible.\n\n> On Wednesday, a day after the tense negotiations, the head of Zelensky\u2019s presidential office, Andriy Yermak, was observed having an intense conversation with Sullivan during the first meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Council, a newly established consultative body created for Ukraine to convene NATO ambassadors and discuss its security concerns.\n\n> Yermak, said one person who witnessed the conversation, appeared as though he was trying to argue. Sullivan, this person said, \u201clooked determined.\u201d The exchange lasted about 30 minutes.\n\n> The tense effort to hold the line on Ukraine\u2019s behalf left some of Kyiv\u2019s strongest advocates exhausted and exasperated.\n\n> \u201cIt was not fun,\u201d said a senior NATO policymaker familiar with the talks.",

Like others, the person spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive talks.</p>\n\n<p>Ambassadors, ministers and other senior policymakers held informal talks about how the alliance should respond. U.S. officials raised the possibility of revisiting or striking the passage to which Zelensky had so forcefully objected: \u201cWe will be in a position to extend an invitation to Ukraine to join the Alliance when Allies agree and conditions are met,\u201d according to European officials involved in the negotiations.</p>\n\n<p>Although Washington has given Kyiv billions of dollars worth of military aid and other support since the war began early last year, President Biden has favored a cautious approach, fearful that doing too much too quickly could risk escalating the crisis and drawing NATO into direct conflict with Russia. Biden attended the Vilnius summit with his secretary of state, Antony Blinken, who has traveled on to Jakarta, Indonesia, for a meeting of foreign ministers from Southeast Asia.</p>\n\n<p>At a summit in Bucharest, Romania, in 2008, Ukraine and Georgia were offered eventual NATO membership, provided they fulfilled a slew of requirements first. Ukrainians complain that 15 years later, they are still facing a host of reform demands, many of which aren\u2019t specific.</p>\n\n<p>A U.S. official familiar with the conversations acknowledged that revisions to the declaration had been considered, saying the Biden administration was sensitive to Zelensky\u2019s concerns and had hoped they might address them somehow.</p>\n\n<p>Three other senior policymakers, however, two of whom were direct participants in the talks, said their strong perception was that the United States was getting ready to water down the document\u2019s language \u2014 to make it less welcoming to a speedy Ukrainian accession to the alliance.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSome wanted to withdraw the reference to \u2018invitation,\u2019\u201d or find another place to put that word, said one of the senior policymakers, a NATO diplomat who took part in the talks.</p>\n\n<p>Spokespeople for the White House and the Ukrainian presidency did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>\n\n<p>Another senior NATO diplomat who took part in the frantic negotiations said that, although \u201cseveral people\u201d supported removing the phrasing that had upset Zelensky, the U.S. delegation \u201cdid not specifically want to take that promise\u201d of an invitation out of the declaration. There was a consensus that reworking the document would delay its release and, \u201cin the end, those most concerned about the Ukrainian reaction came to the conclusion that it would be better to stick with the text\u201d as drafted.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt sends a very clear and strong message,\u201d this person said, \u201cboth to Ukraine and Russia.\u201d</p>\n\n<p><strong>French President Emmanuel Macron, backed by the Central European and Baltic nations, pushed to keep the language originally agreed upon.</strong> Those leaders saw it as the strongest possible offer to Ukraine given reluctance by the United States, Germany and others to go further for fear that doing so would draw the alliance into a direct confrontation with Russia. NATO leaders also announced wide-ranging packages of military assistance for Kyiv.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe landed. The outcome was the best possible,\u201d the diplomat said.</p>\n\n<p>By the time NATO ambassadors formally discussed how to respond to Zelensky\u2019s tweet, the United States was back on board with the declaration\u2019s original wording, the policymakers said.</p>\n\n<p>Inside the leaders\u2019 room, there was more back and forth with advisers than is typical for these types of highly scripted summits, officials said. At one point, the White House national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, entered the room and pulled Biden away from the table, appearing to be talking the president through something, one official said.</p>\n\n<p>Zelensky later softened his tone, expressing gratitude during the in-person meetings in Vilnius and urging for as speedy a Ukrainian accession to the alliance as possible.</p>\n\n<p>On Wednesday, a day after the tense negotiations, the head of Zelensky\u2019s presidential office, Andriy Yermak, was observed having an intense conversation with Sullivan during the first meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Council, a newly established consultative body created for Ukraine to convene NATO ambassadors and discuss its security concerns.</p>\n\n<p>Yermak, said one person who witnessed the conversation, appeared as though he was trying to argue. Sullivan, this person said, \u201clooked determined.\u201d The exchange lasted about 30 minutes.</p>\n\n<p>The tense effort to hold the line on Ukraine\u2019s behalf left some of Kyiv\u2019s strongest advocates exhausted and exasperated.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt was not fun,\u201d said a senior NATO policymaker familiar with the talks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

It's good that we have the Ministry of Digital Transformation, which sometimes replaces the Ministry of Defense. It purchases FPVs as part of the Army of Drones project.

So giving FPV type killer drones to the infantry squad and platoons was not a priority until fairly recently. After all, they can call in support with PGM bombs, artillery, and mortars, right? However, the decision to field them was already progressing by the time this war started, which is why Switchblade 600 already exists. And even then, the priority was anti-personnel, not anti-tank (which is why the first Switchblades 300 issued and used back in the late 2010s against ISIS were anti-personnel). Switchblade 600 is a Javelin warhead stuck in a kamikaze loitering drone, rated to kill basically everything on the battlefield. Not only is Switchblade more powerful than what the Ukrainians build themselves, its also far far far more secure than a DGI drone with an RPG warhead strapped to it. However, its far more expensive too, the control systems are supposedly more complicated or less intuitive than a hasty rigged quadchopper drone with an IED rigged to it flown by a former civilian drone enthusiast who joined the UAF. More than being expensive, there was never a plan to dramatically increase production of them, so there aren't many. \n\nThe manufacturer who designs them wont spend the many millions, potentially billions, out of pocket to increase production capacity to make more based on a hunch that they're be purchased, defense industry rightfully wont take a shit without a contract, because if they do they can be screwed. Artillery ammo was the same way, nobody was going to get massive loans to devote to expansion on the hopes that their rounds would be purchased for a year or two before this war ends. They want a ten year contract so they know their investments pay off. \n\nSo to get more Switchblades or the illusive Phoenix Ghost or anything else first requires a contract, which means Congress first needs to open up funding, and then the manufacturer needs time to increase capacity (construction, more equipment, more employees, more difficult supply chain, etc). Then after roughly a year or so, production amounts increase until they reach max production capacity pumping out the number stipulated in the contract. \n\nCivilian off-the-shelf drone manufacturing is even more difficult. Namely because so many of the manufacturers (especially the ones most commonly used in Ukraine) aren't even made in America, worse are made in the PRC, and worse than that have already been [banned from purchase by the US govt](https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/11/us-order-foreign-drones/), because China isn't trustworthy and neither are their drones, which have pretty significant [security issues](https://dronedj.com/2023/03/05/german-research-finds-security-flaws-in-four-leading-dji-drones/). \n\nSecurity issues Ukraine ignores, forcing them to lose more drones, at which point they and their supporters demand more. \n\nYeah, there are American clone companies who make commercial drones too, and the US is buying from them, as are other govts and organizations, to send them to Ukraine. But there are only a limited number they can build, and to build more requires the US govt to go through all the complicated abovementioned steps to expand production.\n\nThe analogy of a ocean liner ship is often used to describe the defense industry, they don't turn slowly.

To motivate people to conduct such heinous acts you need ideologues goading emotionally vulnerable people and provide them with resources to conduct such attacks.
