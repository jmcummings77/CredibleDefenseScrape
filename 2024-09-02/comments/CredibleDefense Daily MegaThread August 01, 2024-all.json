Following the attack, significant fires were reported at these locations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Russian sources also confirmed the use of Neptune-MG missiles.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Despite the clear evidence of damage, the Russian Ministry of Defense issued an official press release denying any significant impact on their military facilities, claiming that the missiles were intercepted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The target was ~100km from the current borders, so there&#39;s currently no intel on whether they&#39;re standard Neptunes, or the <a href=\"https://www.armyrecognition.com/news/navy-news/2024/ukraine-plans-to-expand-operational-range-of-neptune-anti-ship-missile-system-to-1000-km#google_vignette\">&quot;Long Neptune&quot; variant</a> rumoured to be in development.</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine announced in late 2023 their plan to extend the operational range of its Neptune anti-ship missile system from 300 km to 1000 km and increase its production by ten times. This announcement came meeting between the US Congress National Defense Strategy Committee and the Ukrainian Minister of Strategic Industries.</p>\n</div>",

These missiles, previously donated to Ukraine in undisclosed quantities, have proven highly effective as surface-to-air interceptors against small UAVs like the Russian Orlan-10.*\n\n*A key detail of this contract is the three-year timeline required to ramp up Martlet missile production. This delay underscores the broader issue facing Western nations in quickly replenishing their arsenals, particularly as the UK continues to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression.*\n\n*While the specific number of ordered Martlets remains undisclosed, the deal's total value is GBP 176 million (approximately USD 227 million). The first deliveries to the British Armed Forces are expected to commence in 2027. To meet this contract, Thales UK will expand its workforce by 135 employees, adding to the current 800 staff members in Belfast, Northern Ireland.*\n\n*Andy Start, Chief Executive of Defence Equipment and Support at the UK government, emphasized that this contract aims to ensure a continuous supply of Martlets, minimizing long lead times and production delays.
