He also notes that the government pays little heed to the BND's assessments and generally doesn't rely on it much. Individual agents apparently have a rather realistic picture of Russia, but keep their mouths shut in order to not jeopardise their careers.\n\nOverall his assessment is far more critical of the German government and its uncritical approach to Russia than the BND itself.",

You are relaying that colonizer\u2019s worldview as if it were some profound thought.\n\nIf this was 270 years ago, you would have made this exact same argument about Lithuania\u2019s control of Ukraine.\n\nIf this was 170 years ago, you would have made this exact same argument about the Kingdom of Prussia\u2019s control of Ukraine.\n\nRussia\u2019s expansionist wars of colonialist aggression over the last hundred years do not \u201cexplain the NATO thing.\u201d What was Russia\u2019s excuse then, when NATO wasn\u2019t around for colonizing Ukraine?\n\nI could go on. So why aren\u2019t you currently making precisely the same, say, equally reductionist and assinine argument about Ukraine and Prussia, or Ukraine and Lithuania?

Once you deny the existence of that country, you can do anything you want to the country.</p>\n\n<p>What you are describing is in fact a view of Ukraine from the imperial lens. It\u2019s a classic case of what Timothy Snyder would call Westerners trivializing 1,000 years of Ukrainian history to fit Russia\u2019s view of the conflict. You are relaying that colonizer\u2019s worldview as if it were some profound thought.</p>\n\n<p>If this was 270 years ago, you would have made this exact same argument about Lithuania\u2019s control of Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>If this was 170 years ago, you would have made this exact same argument about the Kingdom of Prussia\u2019s control of Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>Russia\u2019s expansionist wars of colonialist aggression over the last hundred years do not \u201cexplain the NATO thing.\u201d What was Russia\u2019s excuse then, when NATO wasn\u2019t around for colonizing Ukraine?</p>\n\n<p>I could go on. So why aren\u2019t you currently making precisely the same, say, equally reductionist and assinine argument about Ukraine and Prussia, or Ukraine and Lithuania? Because you are merely choosing to reflect and legitimize their  their current and colonizer.</p>\n\n<p>That\u2019s just lazy. Why don\u2019t you make the same argument about the Prussian empire? Spruce the argument up a little.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I suggest you do not triviliaze the Ukrainian war for independence as some trite geopolitical meme where you shoehorn China\u2019s communist revolution into the mix, while adopting the colonial perspective of their destroyer. Instead of asking what Russia thinks about the current conflict, why don\u2019t you become informed about and reflect <em>the colonized\u2019s perspective</em>. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/BCART2T7Ei4\">https://youtu.be/BCART2T7Ei4</a></p>\n</div>",

The challenge for the United States and its allies will be to improve their ability to thwart Russian evasion schemes \u2014 something at which they have a spotty record to date.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the context of what OP was saying, Russian ability to support near-term production from old factories isn&#39;t relevant, what&#39;s relevant is their ability to support R&amp;D, sustain exports and modernize their facilities.

As I see it, a natural line of defense can be rewritten as \"terrain that gives the defenders an advantage\". \nSo a lot of the \"lines of defense\" lie along rivers. This is because crossing a river is harder than not crossing a river. \n\n1) It'll slow down any advance. Tanks and APCs can't just go across (yes there are amphibious vehicles, but even these are slow in water). \n\n2) You are sitting in the open. Any attempt at crossing exposes you as there is no cover on a river so you have to get across quickly and stopping to return fire is probably a bad idea.\n\n3) All your shit gets funneled through small crossings. Be it bridges, pontoons or whatever, EVERYTHING has to go through these points, which are often far apart. Which means the enemy has either knows where you are going to be (fixed bridges), or when they find your pontoon, they know you can't just move it somewhere else. Thus they can move reinforcements there and also drop a bunch of artillery on you.\n\nEven if you manage to secure a bridgehead, all your resupply still has to cross that river meaning it's open to interception. If that supply line gets cut, getting back across is also difficult.\n\n4) On the other side, you are usually surrounded as the enemy will often be on 3 sides of you.\n\nThen you have forests, which are also harder to move through and can hide a lot of enemy troops. If you just blast past them, you might get hit in the rear.\n\nI would argue that another important point of a \"line of defense\" are urban areas, which I guess act as anchors. In a large sprawling urban area, you can hide a LOT of troops and they might even have shelter against the elements (depending on the state of the city). These urban areas usually have good infrastructure, meaning that the defenders can move their troops around within this area fairly quickly (they also have shorter lines of communication within the area, rather than outside). Not to mention they will have a lot of cover in all the buildings and unless you clear all of them, you are going to get shot in the back.\n\nI think people with experience can look at a map and see such features, which make defense easier.",

(Complete ceasure of all trade with Russia, secondary sanctions on <em>entire</em> countries that don&#39;t ban trading with Russia, Freezing Russian reserves etc.) The cost of China pursing a aggressive policy against Russia to just maybe stop the war in Ukraine would far outweigh not doing anything and trying to mitigate the impact it has domestically imo.</p>\n</div>",

But what made the Germans effective is they staffed those units primarily with German NCOs and officers. It's pretty hard to fight like shit or quit if motivated fanatics are supervising who regularly use brutal means to keep the troops in line.\n\nBut Russia has dogshit left for junior leadership, not enough for their own units, let alone to staff units filled with ethnic Ukrainians. \n\nHowever, conscripting them into the RuAF and sending them to the ass end of Russia acts almost like a long term filtration camp.

Do you have examples? \n\n>The reason why I'm a little skeptical of this list is that pretty much all sources agree that Russia has a significant advantage in both fires and personnel on this front, which would be surprising if every single unit you noted was there in full. \n\nI have no clue what the Russians actually have there but it doesn't sound impressive. Jack Watling's description when he was on Kofman's podcast had me very interested but also laughing a bit at the crazy steps the Russians are taking in order to conduct deliberate attacks in Bakhmut, which could never work for nearly anything else.\n\nThe assault groups are supposedly brigade based as I described. I\nThough it's probably likely a bunch of their CAA level separate artillery brigades and regiments are supporting the Bakhmut fight (the Russians have many of those, especially compared to the Ukrainians, which is there the mismatch exists). \n\n But I really don't trust anything giving ratios, unless someone can provide an exact ORBAT for the Russians. Frankly, I don't buy 10:1 fires ratio in Bakhmut as some reports are saying, which harkens to the worst times in the Donbas offensive in the mid summer, especially when the MLR was often held by TDF who don't even possess organic arty, or how the UAF were galavanting in Kharkiv and Kherson too. \n\nBut now all but the three TDF/Nat'l Guard Bdes I mentioned possess their own organic arty, at least on paper, and it's been reported not only in MilitaryLand but also the news from a month ago or more that the 40th Artillery Bde is in the right there too. The fact that the 40th was sent indicates Bakhmut's strategic importance, those limited arty brigades are at least as important as HIMARS/M270 batteries.

They list pretty much every other reason, especially those negative. Kofman typically brings up politics as the reason whereas Perun said he thinks the Russians are trying to win a battle of attrition. Either might be totally right, together they might be right because I don't think there is any single reason any operation is performed, though usually there is a primary reason. \n\nI could be wrong about the motive, but even if I'm wrong then even inadvertently the Bakhmut offensive has acted as a fixing action. There is no reason at all there should be this amount of focus on that city, and it's only happening because the Russians are attacking there.

But some Western officials now doubt the Kremlin was responsible.</p>\n\n<p>With winter approaching, it appeared the Kremlin intended to strangle the flow of energy to millions across the continent, an act of \u201cblackmail,\u201d some leaders said, designed to threaten countries into withdrawing their financial and military support for Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>But now, after months of investigation, numerous officials privately say that Russia may not be to blame after all for the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThere is no evidence at this point that Russia was behind the sabotage,\u201d said one European official, echoing the assessment of 23 diplomatic and intelligence officials in nine countries interviewed in recent weeks.</p>\n\n<p>Some went so far as to say they didn\u2019t think Russia was responsible. Others who still consider Russia a prime suspect said positively attributing the attack \u2014 to any country \u2014 may be impossible.</p>\n\n<p>An official with the German government, which is conducting its own investigation, said explosives appear to have been placed on the outside of the structures.</p>\n\n<p>But even those with inside knowledge of the forensic details don\u2019t conclusively tie Russia to the attack, officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to share information about the progress of the investigation, some of which is based on classified intelligence.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The United States routinely intercepts the communications of Russian officials and military forces, a clandestine intelligence effort that helped accurately forecast Moscow\u2019s February invasion of Ukraine. But so far, analysts have not heard or read statements from the Russian side taking credit or suggesting that they\u2019re trying to cover up their involvement, officials said.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Once it&#39;s blown up, there&#39;s no longer the incentive of potential future deliveries to push Europe to back down.</p>\n\n<p>Same with the gaz going through Ukraine: Nordstream going down means that the pipelines they have control over become more relevant.</p>\n</div>",
