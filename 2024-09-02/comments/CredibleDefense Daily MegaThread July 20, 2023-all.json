        "body": "Part 1 of *The Russia Contingency* podcast featuring Mike Kofman and Rob Lee's discussion of their takeaways from the first month and a half of the Ukrainian counter-offensive dropped today. Part 2 is now available, and I'll draft notes as soon as I get time to listen to it hopefully later this evening. \n\nKey Takeaways:\n\n* Russia is defending in a highly competent manner along the front. They were caught completely unprepared during the Kharkiv offensive and learned many lessons from that. Southern lines are entrenched at the divisional and even combined arms army level. \n\n\n* They're fighting according to doctrine (multiple layers of minefields and trenches, presighted artillery, frontline troops have lots of AT weapons, semi-regular counterattacks, escheloned lines) but employing even more mines than doctrine calls for. They're mixing AT and AP mines, double or even triple stacking AT mines to knock out Ukrainian mine rolling vehicles, and specifically targeting Ukrainian engineering vehicles. They also regularly disperse new mines with their MLRS delivery vehicles, including behind lines Ukrainians have taken, especially roads used to resupply Ukrainian forces. \n\n\n* Russia is working hard to mitigate the weaknesses of their lower quality units. They have \"expendable\" troops holding first line trenches and less important areas, bolstered by higher quality units who are holding key parts of the line and used to launch counterattacks. Spetsnaz are being used extensively I'm this role, and are highly effective with ATGMs. By mixing units, lower quality forces are less likely to break. Marine infantry and more highly trained Motorized rifle units are also being used in similar role. \n\n\n* The mystery of why Ukraine didn't press Russian forces harder during Kherson withdrawal was answered, it was because Russia used tons of mines there as well. Some of the last equipment that they withdrew were mine-laying MLRS vehicles. \n\n\n* Russia is noticeably conserving artillery usage, giving Ukraine a relative but not decisive advantage in tube artillery. Russia still has an advantage in MLRS though Ukraine likely has an advantage in PGMs and long range precision strikes. Kofman stresses that overall Ukrainian fires advantage is *not* decisive and its limited by their supply of munitions from the West. \n\n\n* Ukraine has serious misteps in first days of the offensive, which were costly. Ukraine has a mix of newly raised \"NATO-trained and equipped\" units and more experienced units fighting in the South. The experienced units have taken most of the ground Ukraine has captured thus far. \n\n\n* Ukraine's big gamble in this offensive was forming those brand new \"NATO\" brigades. During Russian Winter offensive, Ukraine used highly experienced units like the 93rd Mechanized and 3rd Assault Brigade to hold off the Russian offensive while new brigades were formed. They suffered significant losses and weren't able to rest and refit before this offensive as a result. Unfortunately the newly formed \"NATO\" brigades haven't lived up to expectations and have underperformed thus far. Importantly, the whole units were brand new, including support, artillery, and infantry formations. As such, there's a seeming lack of unit cohesion among these new units and the accelerated training timeline didn't give them enough time to learn capabilities of new equipment or how best to employ them in combined arms operations. \n\n\n* The first days of the offensive revealed a number of issues with the new brigades related to reconnaissance of their routes and for their artillery, poor coordination with neighboring units, trouble finding the right targets, problems with engineering, poor coordination with the units whose positions they were taking (i.e. where minefields and terrain features were located), some units got lost at night and others didn't travel down lanes that been cleared of mines. One brigade's advance was apparently delayed by several hours and instead of attacking at night using their superior night fighting capabilities, they attacked at dawn instead. This delay also meant that the Russian units who had been bombarded by Ukrainian artillery were no longer suppressed when they did advance, leading to heavy losses from ATGMs. There was also a lack of a proper \"Plan B\" once they started running into these issues. Most of these problems wouldn't have occurred with more experienced units. \n\n\n* In the first days of the offensive, mines were a problem but the advance was really more blunted by Russian artillery and ATGMs. **The failures of these new units in the first days of the offensive squandered the Ukrainian element of surprise and gave them precious time to react.**\n\n\n* They are very clearly referring to the shitshow that was the assault by the 47th Brigade, where they lost multiple Leopards, Bradleys, and engineering vehicles. \n\n\n* Kofman: Ukraine has proven itself highly skilled on the defense, but its struggled offensively the whole war, especially at scaling up operations beyond the company level. This offensive, while using brigades on paper, was handled more as a series of company or reinforced company-level assaults launched largely independent of one another.",

Just finished up with Part 2, here are my key takeaways:[^^^brought ^^^to ^^^you ^^^as ^^^always ^^^by ^^^the ^^^Lemmy](https://sh.itjust.works/post/1468839)\n\nThe counteroffensive was practically prosecuted by company-sized elements. This resulted from the Ukrainian military's struggles with coordinating actions above the battalion level. The military tends to rely on sequencing rather than coordination and struggles to deal with setbacks.\n\nDearth of experienced officers and veterans as a result of losses and massive expansion of the army. Leaders were unwilling to give up valuable personnel for staffing the new brigades. Stars who did go came with drawbacks of their own--see 47th Brigade. New brigades struggled to attract talent due to these factors. \n\nNeed to take a critical look at the idea of standing up wholly new brigades as opposed to having continued to work and train within existing forces. More experienced brigades have shown better results than newer force organizations across all three theaters. The jury is still out on the new brigades, but the concept needs scrutiny.\n\n\"You go to war with the army you have\", but you also have to use the army you have, not the army you would like to have. Ukraine relies on artillery fires to enable their maneuver. Trying to adapt to a radically different doctrine put the Ukrainian military in a difficult position. Western maneuver doctrine has advantages but does not necessarily work for Ukraine given what they have available.\n\nPulling back veterans for counteroffensive training, then supplementing them with newer troops as support would have been a better strategy, *even if doing so means pulling out of Bakhmut quicker*.\n\nThe early hours of the counteroffensive were crucial--most artillery, least prepared Russian forces, etc., etc. Veteran brigades might have been able to push through the stumbling blocks that derailed the newer personnel that were at the tip of the spear.\n\nRob Lee offers a bit of nuance to a surprisingly unambiguous Kofman. There is no risk-free option here. If Ukraine had tried to pull back veteran units over the winter, there's a real possibility that they would have lost more terrain elsewhere.\n\nThis is a very good Russian defense. Even with veteran brigades and fully equipped troops, it's not clear that the counteroffensive could have reached all the way to Melitopol, or even to the main defensive line. No guarantee the alternative would\n\nBack to Kofman. Against such a prepared defense, a combined arms offensive was unlikely to succeed without enabling factors like air superiority. In fact, even most Western militaries lack the resources to perform such an operation without the US leading the way in the integrating role.\n\nThe offensive is far from over. Just because the initial offensive was unsuccessful, doesn't mean the whole offensive will be a failure. New brigades have combat experience, will make changes. There is going to be tactical adaptation. \n\nUkrainian fighting is dependent on infantry advances. Platform-based demining is less important than man-portable demining equipment. Present Ukrainian techniques clear narrow lanes that choke logistics and cannot permit vehicles. Infantry systems like APOBs would be much more effective and efficient.\n\nCurrent fires are not meant to pull apart command and control, though some Storm Shadows have been used to that effect Attrition has worked for Ukraine in the past. and it may work here.\n\nDon't expect mechanized maneuver to make a sudden appearance anytime soon. Ukrainian tankers have learned that massing armor is a lethal mistake. Most tanks on both sides are used in indirect fire and infantry support roles. Anti-tank roles are carried out by infantry and artillery. Tanks operate in pairs, one firing and the other providing overwatch and support. Tank brigades seem to be nascent and not present in this fight. Even a substantial breakthrough will struggle to gain momentum. Western expectations of how Ukraine will employ its forces don't align with Ukrainian takeaways from the last year and a half of war.\n\nRob Lee: Relative attritional balances are hard to predict from OSINT data. **The side on the offensive tends to take heavier losses and that is likely true in this case**, but open source data on losses shows clear successes in Ukrainian counterbattery and high-value targeting. Ukrainian ability to field UAVs behind Russian lines is a positive sign. But a significant breakthrough is far from guaranteed.\n\nRussia has enough UAVs to maintain constant overwatch of the frontline. Able to interdict masses of armor. Lower fires does not necessarily mean Russia is running out of shells--they are holding them in reserve for when they see the most threat.\n\nTerrain is very good for observation and therefore long-range ATGMs. Russian helicopters and glide bombs are another pain point. \n\nInfantry advances reduce casualties, but slow everything down. Places a heavy burden on individual soldiers due to the inability for vehicles to penetrate with infantry. 47th Brigade has begun advancing after pivoting to infantry advance, but this is measured in hundreds of meters. \n\nThe major constraint is artillery ammunition. If there is not a quick enough advance, Ukraine will run out of shells before they reach their objectives.\n\nUkraine continues to hold an advantage in small squad tactics.\n\nKofman: DPICMs are all about the numbers. Buys the Ukrainian army time to fight into the fall. Sense is that Ukrainians are determined, learning. They are nasty weapons, but there is no other stockpile to be given to Ukraine.\n\n**Just because the West stops giving Ukraine the capacity to stop the war, does not mean that Russia will suddenly stop the war**. If anything, they will try to press their advantage even harder. **The position that Ukraine should get Western support until the first unsuccessful offensive does not make any sense.** \n\nUkraine needs nightfighting capabilities, man-portable capabilities, and to push those things all the way down, even to units that may not be part of the traditional army structure like National Guard.\n\nEnds by recommending a series of articles that [Kofman has also shared here](https://twitter.com/KofmanMichael/status/1681592680021733376).",

Tank brigades seem to be nascent and not present in this fight. Even a substantial breakthrough will struggle to gain momentum. Western expectations of how Ukraine will employ its forces don&#39;t align with Ukrainian takeaways from the last year and a half of war.</p>\n\n<p>Rob Lee: Relative attritional balances are hard to predict from OSINT data. <strong>The side on the offensive tends to take heavier losses and that is likely true in this case</strong>, but open source data on losses shows clear successes in Ukrainian counterbattery and high-value targeting. Ukrainian ability to field UAVs behind Russian lines is a positive sign. But a significant breakthrough is far from guaranteed.</p>\n\n<p>Russia has enough UAVs to maintain constant overwatch of the frontline. Able to interdict masses of armor. Lower fires does not necessarily mean Russia is running out of shells--they are holding them in reserve for when they see the most threat.</p>\n\n<p>Terrain is very good for observation and therefore long-range ATGMs. Russian helicopters and glide bombs are another pain point. </p>\n\n<p>Infantry advances reduce casualties, but slow everything down. Places a heavy burden on individual soldiers due to the inability for vehicles to penetrate with infantry. 47th Brigade has begun advancing after pivoting to infantry advance, but this is measured in hundreds of meters. </p>\n\n<p>The major constraint is artillery ammunition. If there is not a quick enough advance, Ukraine will run out of shells before they reach their objectives.</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine continues to hold an advantage in small squad tactics.</p>\n\n<p>Kofman: DPICMs are all about the numbers. Buys the Ukrainian army time to fight into the fall. Sense is that Ukrainians are determined, learning. They are nasty weapons, but there is no other stockpile to be given to Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Just because the West stops giving Ukraine the capacity to stop the war, does not mean that Russia will suddenly stop the war</strong>. If anything, they will try to press their advantage even harder. <strong>The position that Ukraine should get Western support until the first unsuccessful offensive does not make any sense.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Ukraine needs nightfighting capabilities, man-portable capabilities, and to push those things all the way down, even to units that may not be part of the traditional army structure like National Guard.</p>\n\n<p>Ends by recommending a series of articles that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KofmanMichael/status/1681592680021733376\">Kofman has also shared here</a>.</p>\n</div>",

If not, maybe they stretched themselves too wide conducting too many actual breaches and not enough very limited attacks as feints and fixing operations. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>These actually work quite okay for what I know.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t mean work in theory, I mean in practice. These were cooked up and fielded with limited live testing. They&#39;re ungodly heavy, they often don&#39;t work, their range is shit, they still often don&#39;t detonate all the mines, and if there were you can&#39;t proof the lane with a mine detector because metal bits of shit go everywhere. Plus there is no clearcut doctrine that goes with them, there aren&#39;t many of them built, they are not easy to get resupplied (not common in supply system.  </p>\n\n<p>From what I heard when I was in and afterwards the US Army engineers issued them in Afghanistan and training have said they&#39;re best for getting through thick brush or light wire obstacles, not actual minefields.</p>\n</div>",

                        "body": "Ukraine has MORE artillery than the US Army would. They have a buttload more PGM's than the US Army has had access to in previous wars. \n\nBut the US Army wouldn't fight the way the Ukrainians do and I'm not talking about air support, which the US Army doesn't really even train with much and doesn't include as a necessity for tactical level operations, especially not at the brigade level unless you're just talking about division level aviation brigade helicopter support, which might include attack aviation (AH-64). \n\nSo take a US Army corps of armored brigade combat teams, the closest analogue to the Ukrainian motorized infantry, mechanized infantry, air assault, and tank brigades, and switch them. \n\nIt would have planned the battles totally different. Far less breaching attempts over a broad front, more fixing operations, feints, and with the main effort massed to an ungodly amount. \n\nThey might have bungled the breach, that's still hard as hell, but not made the same amateur mistakes because a US Army company commander would have already done it many more times in training than his counterpart in Ukraine. \n\nThe typical Ukraine battalion and brigade commander probably never trained on it legitimately (no real combined arms unit training has been done in Ukraine since the war started, and it wasn't a task they did much before). Whereas the US Army equivalent had been doing it extensively since the GWOT \"ended\" in 2014, where they switched to Near Peer focus v. Russia before Afghan deployments were even over. So a full decade, including multiple NTC rotations and potentially other large scale exercises where they were involved as commander, staff, or other role. \n\nIn terms of higher level officers, Ukrainian colonels on staffs and various general officers that are command and staff officers, they'd probably not seriously practiced it since the Soviet Union dissolved, and they'd been using Soviet 70s era tactics that are quite different from the US Army (the Soviet Armed Forces didn't really update their tactical level doctrine from the 80-early 90ss onward).  US Army colonels and generals still have the 10 years of planning this, plus you have the dinosaurs like the 4 stars who are old Cold Warriors, who lived, ate, breathed fighting the Russians in a major mechanized war. They literally wrote the book on the combined arms breach. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Teaching the Ukrainians to follow the \"standard US Army approach to breaching operations\" seems almost asinine considering the equipment they are operating and the level of defence/technology they are facing. \n\nFirst, that definitely didn't happen. Since January, at most, 15x Ukrainian battalions were trained by the US Army National Guard on mechanized combined arms operations, focusing on offensive ops, with the culminating exercise being the combined arms breach. It was taught by an infantry BCT, not from an armored, so the trainers literally aren't even tankers/mech infantry. It was done to such an abbreviated and basic manner it didn't include any fancy TTPs, let alone the ones a US Army Armored Brigade would use. it barely trained the company and battalion leadership. It did not at all train the Ukrainian brigade command and staff or higher, who are the ones most needing that type of training. \n\nAs for the approach the US pushed on them to follow were called the fundamentals for a reason, because they're primary rules period, end of story. \n\nIf your ground force wants to get through an obstacle belt that is defended, be it a mined wire infantry obstacle or the one in front of Tokmat you need to suppress enemy around the breach area, obscure the point of breach, reduce the obstacles, and assault the defenses. \n\nA super useful acronym to know.

                        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Ukraine has MORE artillery than the US Army would. They have a buttload more PGM&#39;s than the US Army has had access to in previous wars. </p>\n\n<p>But the US Army wouldn&#39;t fight the way the Ukrainians do and I&#39;m not talking about air support, which the US Army doesn&#39;t really even train with much and doesn&#39;t include as a necessity for tactical level operations, especially not at the brigade level unless you&#39;re just talking about division level aviation brigade helicopter support, which might include attack aviation (AH-64). </p>\n\n<p>So take a US Army corps of armored brigade combat teams, the closest analogue to the Ukrainian motorized infantry, mechanized infantry, air assault, and tank brigades, and switch them. </p>\n\n<p>It would have planned the battles totally different. Far less breaching attempts over a broad front, more fixing operations, feints, and with the main effort massed to an ungodly amount. </p>\n\n<p>They might have bungled the breach, that&#39;s still hard as hell, but not made the same amateur mistakes because a US Army company commander would have already done it many more times in training than his counterpart in Ukraine. </p>\n\n<p>The typical Ukraine battalion and brigade commander probably never trained on it legitimately (no real combined arms unit training has been done in Ukraine since the war started, and it wasn&#39;t a task they did much before). Whereas the US Army equivalent had been doing it extensively since the GWOT &quot;ended&quot; in 2014, where they switched to Near Peer focus v. Russia before Afghan deployments were even over. So a full decade, including multiple NTC rotations and potentially other large scale exercises where they were involved as commander, staff, or other role. </p>\n\n<p>In terms of higher level officers, Ukrainian colonels on staffs and various general officers that are command and staff officers, they&#39;d probably not seriously practiced it since the Soviet Union dissolved, and they&#39;d been using Soviet 70s era tactics that are quite different from the US Army (the Soviet Armed Forces didn&#39;t really update their tactical level doctrine from the 80-early 90ss onward).  US Army colonels and generals still have the 10 years of planning this, plus you have the dinosaurs like the 4 stars who are old Cold Warriors, who lived, ate, breathed fighting the Russians in a major mechanized war. They literally wrote the book on the combined arms breach. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Teaching the Ukrainians to follow the &quot;standard US Army approach to breaching operations&quot; seems almost asinine considering the equipment they are operating and the level of defence/technology they are facing. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>First, that definitely didn&#39;t happen. Since January, at most, 15x Ukrainian battalions were trained by the US Army National Guard on mechanized combined arms operations, focusing on offensive ops, with the culminating exercise being the combined arms breach. It was taught by an infantry BCT, not from an armored, so the trainers literally aren&#39;t even tankers/mech infantry. It was done to such an abbreviated and basic manner it didn&#39;t include any fancy TTPs, let alone the ones a US Army Armored Brigade would use. it barely trained the company and battalion leadership. It did not at all train the Ukrainian brigade command and staff or higher, who are the ones most needing that type of training. </p>\n\n<p>As for the approach the US pushed on them to follow were called the fundamentals for a reason, because they&#39;re primary rules period, end of story. </p>\n\n<p>If your ground force wants to get through an obstacle belt that is defended, be it a mined wire infantry obstacle or the one in front of Tokmat you need to suppress enemy around the breach area, obscure the point of breach, reduce the obstacles, and assault the defenses. </p>\n\n<p>A super useful acronym to know. How many of the barely trained UAF lieutenants know it? How many captains promoted because they survived know it? How many battalion commanders who hadn&#39;t done it in the Donbas War and hadn&#39;t done it in this one, at least not correctly, know it? How many of the &quot;we&#39;ll take anyone breathing&quot; brigade commanders know it, many of whom were pulled out of retirement not having served since they were Soviet reserve officers?  </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>That&#39;s exactly why we see Ukraine proceeding with infantry centric assaults now.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He didn&#39;t say that was because they prefer those, its because that&#39;s all they can do at this point. </p>\n\n<p>When he and the other analysts in his per group say the Ukrainians can&#39;t scale operations, it means they can&#39;t do multiple simultaneous successful operations at the battalion or brigade level or higher, with those HQs running them.

Green units will SNAFU/FUBAR  things. Missing a turn is also an age old military mistake. \n\nOne must crawl before walking, walk before running, etc. Such errors will subside, unit by unit, (just as they likely are for the Russians). What I\u2019m not sure will subside is the inability to make mobile advances.

Green units will SNAFU/FUBAR  things. Missing a turn is also an age old military mistake. </p>\n\n<p>One must crawl before walking, walk before running, etc. Such errors will subside, unit by unit, (just as they likely are for the Russians). What I\u2019m not sure will subside is the inability to make mobile advances.

        "body": "Using the new thread to answer the interesting question from u/Duncan-M who on yesterday's thread had asked if I had any idea about the brigades from the 10th Operational Corps not yet deployed to the front and about the Ukrainian brigades who may be currently in the strategic reserve. I will try to answer with what I am aware of - there may of course have been news that I am not informed about.\n\nThe 10th Corps has been officially created, although I wonder if the brigades part of it have changed or if it's more of a \"formal\" formation - because for example the 21st Mech Brigade with CV90s is along the Zherebets (a new video came out a few hours ago), same for the 32nd Mech in Svatove, while most of the Corps' brigades are in the South. In the South there are the 116/117/118th Mech Brigades that according to Rybar (yes, sometimes by mistake he manages to get it right) are around Kamyanske ready to support the 128th Mountain Brigade. The AS-90 destroyed earlier this month in Mali Shcherbaky (in the rear of the sector) may be from the 117th in fact. In the Orikhiv sector the first brigades of the Offensive Guard (Azov, Spartan, Kara-Dag) have been deployed. Their deployment could be consistent with a new Ukrainian strategy aimed at using smallish infantry groups to conquer tree lines and trenches while minimizing mechanized assaults, although I saw that they also have demining equipments. Maybe more Offensive Guard brigades will be added (each has its own role, for example the Lyut Brigade, of which little is known yet, is made up of former policemen and specialized for urban combat). In the area there is also the 46th Airmobile Brigade which was refitted after Soledar but has yet to see action. In Velyka Novosilka the first elements of the 38th Marine Brigade were reportedly spotted, in theory the 82nd Air Assault Brigade could be in the area as well if they are not in Orikhiv (they released footage of them carrying out an attack on a Russian position using a FPV drone).\n\nAn interesting issue is that of the Ukrainian tank brigades. The 1st, 3rd, and 4th are deployed in the South, around Velyka Novosilka, but have yet to see action on the frontlines afaik, particularly their mechanized battalions. Perhaps they could \"lend\" tank units to other brigades, since large-scale armored attacks are not likely to be planned at the moment. The 17th Tank Brigade is in the rear in Bakhmut. The 5th Tank Brigade was never actually activated. There is a tank battalion of the 3rd Tank Brigade in the Kupyansk sector supporting the 14th and new 88th Mech Brigades. Also the new 48th and 49th Artillery Brigades have yet to show up. \n\nThe 60th Mech Brigade is deployed in Kharkiv on the border with Belgorod Oblast. The 61st, 62nd, and 115th Mech Brigades have not seen action for months and almost nothing is known about them, except that the 61st recently received T-72EAs and RM-70s. I think they are the Ukrainian strategic reserve to be sent to the most needy sectors. Even if I am not aware about their readiness status (for instance, they may not have their battalions fully equipped).\n\nThen there is the new 78th Air Assault Regiment, which is supposed to be the only Ukrainian unit actually specialized in air assault (and not in name only, even if I saw that the 71st Jager Brigade which is part of the Air Assault Forces recently trained with helicopters). The Kraken Regiment remains in the rear of Kharkiv. The 13th Jager Brigade was being formed and I think it could be ready (elements of the brigade were trained in Norway) - I think they might be an operational reserve for Kreminna? Or they may be deployed elsewhere, we'll see.\n\nThere are the 41/43/44th Mech Brigades still being formed, just like the 141/143/144th Rifle Brigades. In my opinion, these latter brigades are an innovation to improve the role of the TDF by creating lightly armored brigades specialized in defensive roles in \"hot\" sectors to relieve the veteran Ukrainian brigades. There have been several instances in the last months where TD brigades have complained about being deployed elsewhere (e.g. if I recall correctly the 129th TD Brigade from Kryvyi Rih deployed near Avdiivka for months), because as far as I heard once, their contract states that they should be deployed to defend their own oblast. This obviously makes no sense after April 2022 (save for the TD brigades from Chernihiv/Sumy etc.) and in general I think that as many TD brigades as possible should be improved and reformed: their pool of men is very large and should be used as efficiently as possible. The various TD brigades support the actions of the mechanized ones and are occasionally moved where needed. According to Russian sources a battalion of the 115th TD Brigade from Zhytomyr might be around Avdiivka (until now it had always been one of the brigades guarding the Belarusian border), although there is no confirmation.\n\nThe 142nd Rifle Brigade was deployed to Avdiivka to replace the battalions of the 35/36th Marine Brigades sent to Velyka Novosilka. I think the model the rifle brigades are inspired by is the Separate Presidential Brigade, I wonder if they will receive armored vehicles at this stage though. There is also the Consolidated Rifle Brigade being created which is made up of volunteer/mobilized ground personnel from the Air Force. \n\nThere are the many separate rifle battalions but I don't know much about them, I think the purpose is to aggregate them into these new brigades. Then there are other \"particular\" brigades like the 1st Special Purpose Brigade which is supposed to be in Kreminna and the 101st Brigade for the Protection of the General Staff which was around Bakhmut and not much has been known about it since April.",

To some extent, these campaigns simply make the Russians look incompetent and do not have that much of an effect because the disinformation is so easily identified.

                    "body": "Radar, above and beyond the best US feature. US planes have for decades been able to look first, find first, shoot first. Older Migs and Flankers struggle with smaller, less efficient radars. That means that while you may have theoretical range, if you struggle to acquire youre targets you may not be able to make best use of that added engagement distance. The only Russian plane that doesnt suffer from this issue is the MiG-31, and weve seen the result. The with Radar, as I understand it, is that for fighter-sized radars physical size and emitter density on the array matters a TON for range and resolution. Russians have always struggled with emitters. \n\nAmericans likely have a numbers advantage in key missile groups, with there being a TON of AIM-120Cs out in the world while the R77-1 and -2 are relatively rare and much sought after. F-15s can bring up something stupid like 15 AIM-120s and sustain that for a very long time, while the Russians have to be more picky with how they employ the good missiles. In BVR combat, shooting first is probably the most important single advantage you can have. \n\nAmerican airframes are very good overall. The F-15 has never been lost in air to air combat, the F-16 may be even better in a dog fight than the very good Su-27, and so on. American plans are well built, designed intelligently, AND are maintained by highly motivated and skilled crews. So good capabilities in the air, frequent sortie rates, fewer operation (non-enemy) losses.\n\nAmerican airborne control (AWACs) is plentiful and high quality, as is its tanker fleet. American pilots practice regularly at tanker ops. These kind of logistics things seem nice, you can extend the range of the aircraft which is cool. BUT tanker ops are one of the secrets to the big knockout air operations the US likes. You only get about 2hrs flight time in most jets, a little more with tanks but every tank you bring up is a bomb sitting on the runway. Taking off and rallying a fist of aircraft around a central area takes a long time, and requires a TON of coordination. Everything is timed off so that your SEAD and long range strikes hit and knock the lights out just seconds or minutes before other planes with other ordinance hit their targets. To do that you need tankers just sitting over friendly airfields keeping the first flights up ready to go while the back flights get into position. This was supposedly a huge problem with the initial Russian air attack, which went in staggered because the RuAF is not great at tankering, and lacks the airframes it needs to do it right. \n\nAmerican aircraft and pilots are GREAT at CAS, and their airframes are flexible enough to do both CAS and CAP. Yeah sure you can put a bomb on a flanker but why would you? Its like putting a trailer hitch on a 911 Porsche. Anyone who does should not be allowed within 100ft of one. Same with the Mig-29 and -31. Russia does CAS with very good dedicated platforms like the Su-24s and -25s. Except like the A-10 *they* dont do CAP. At all. So you have this awkward truffle shuffle. Expecting enemy aircraft, send up your good interceptors. Trying to bomb a target? Send in the CAS. But no one airframe, no one pilot, can do both. An F-16 or an F-18 can do both. This means naturally theyre not as good at the one job, and with bombs they fly like pigs. But then an F-16 can bring a HARM with it on every operation and fling it off if a SAM ambushes them (and this is, btw, pretty widely accepted SOP. So much so that you can set the HARM on most US planes to automatically flip engagement modes from ground or air attack to HARM so the pilot just has to depress the firing switch and engage the SAM. Learned that nifty fact from DCS). Su-35, good as it is, cant do that. AFAIK it cant fire a long range ground attack PGM or an antishipping missile either, F-15s, -16s, -18s, and -35s can do that in the morning, then fly CAP in the afternoon. \n\nLast, probably the most important, the average training and experience of American pilots is some of the best in the world. You dont get a chance to fly in combat until you hit the, IIRC, 2.5yr mark. A year in selection, a year in US training, a few months in with-unit training. Because of the significant investment you most likely wont even get a shot at flying in a combat unit unless you committed to a longer term contract, USAF doesn't want to spend 2+ years training you just for you to bail at four years. So most pilots who get in stay for the long haul, and taking a second tour on those long contracts is pretty common. So youre looking at guys with 4-5yrs avg service, but a lot longer is just as common! Thats itself pretty rare, Russia and China both AFAIK get pilots into the chair in about half the time. Russia also, because of maint problems, struggles to get flying hours in whereas in the USAF you *must* grind hours, not just to keep your qualification but because there is a longterm pay thing (its called gating) which depends on your hours flown. You want a bigger paycheck right? The US *also* has some of the most realistic training facilities in the world with Red Flag in Nevada. They can conduct entirely simulated air wars out there, and record everything that happens for later processing. Other places have similar facilities, but in the US we have both the space (it occurs over like half of Nevada, and is linked to some test ranges in New Mexico as well as the NTC at Ft. Irwin if you wanna impress the mud boys), the technology, and the money to develop such a sophisticated facility. And keep it going. With captured 'enemy' aircraft in aggressor squadrons. And simulate entire combined arms operations in it. There was an interview I read from an F-15 pilot during Desert Storm who had done two Red Flag ops in the 1980s. He said he was fighting a Mig-21, chased it into a dive. He said that as he watched the MiG smash into the ground he realized that 1) he knew that pilot had no chance of pulling out of that dive, and 2) guessed the enemy pilot *didnt* know that. Put another way, he knew the *other guys plane* better than they did. I dont think there are many RuAF pilots, or PLAAF pilots, who can claim to know the F-15 or -16 that well. \n\nBut lets not get *too* chauvinistic here about cool military tech. For anyone with eyes in their head and a brain with thoughts, the biggest takeaway from Ukraine should be (IMO) that the west no longer enjoys unchallenged technological superiority. Maybe we never did. Or maybe we lost it. But neither China nor Russia are going to go down like the Iraqis did, best to assume that theyre 90% tech wise if not quite there yet with quantity (tho, to be fair, China is not lacking in quantity either).",
                    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Radar, above and beyond the best US feature. US planes have for decades been able to look first, find first, shoot first. Older Migs and Flankers struggle with smaller, less efficient radars. That means that while you may have theoretical range, if you struggle to acquire youre targets you may not be able to make best use of that added engagement distance. The only Russian plane that doesnt suffer from this issue is the MiG-31, and weve seen the result. The with Radar, as I understand it, is that for fighter-sized radars physical size and emitter density on the array matters a TON for range and resolution. Russians have always struggled with emitters. </p>\n\n<p>Americans likely have a numbers advantage in key missile groups, with there being a TON of AIM-120Cs out in the world while the R77-1 and -2 are relatively rare and much sought after. F-15s can bring up something stupid like 15 AIM-120s and sustain that for a very long time, while the Russians have to be more picky with how they employ the good missiles. In BVR combat, shooting first is probably the most important single advantage you can have. </p>\n\n<p>American airframes are very good overall. The F-15 has never been lost in air to air combat, the F-16 may be even better in a dog fight than the very good Su-27, and so on. American plans are well built, designed intelligently, AND are maintained by highly motivated and skilled crews. So good capabilities in the air, frequent sortie rates, fewer operation (non-enemy) losses.</p>\n\n<p>American airborne control (AWACs) is plentiful and high quality, as is its tanker fleet. American pilots practice regularly at tanker ops. These kind of logistics things seem nice, you can extend the range of the aircraft which is cool. BUT tanker ops are one of the secrets to the big knockout air operations the US likes. You only get about 2hrs flight time in most jets, a little more with tanks but every tank you bring up is a bomb sitting on the runway. Taking off and rallying a fist of aircraft around a central area takes a long time, and requires a TON of coordination. Everything is timed off so that your SEAD and long range strikes hit and knock the lights out just seconds or minutes before other planes with other ordinance hit their targets. To do that you need tankers just sitting over friendly airfields keeping the first flights up ready to go while the back flights get into position. This was supposedly a huge problem with the initial Russian air attack, which went in staggered because the RuAF is not great at tankering, and lacks the airframes it needs to do it right. </p>\n\n<p>American aircraft and pilots are GREAT at CAS, and their airframes are flexible enough to do both CAS and CAP. Yeah sure you can put a bomb on a flanker but why would you? Its like putting a trailer hitch on a 911 Porsche. Anyone who does should not be allowed within 100ft of one. Same with the Mig-29 and -31. Russia does CAS with very good dedicated platforms like the Su-24s and -25s. Except like the A-10 <em>they</em> dont do CAP. At all. So you have this awkward truffle shuffle. Expecting enemy aircraft, send up your good interceptors. Trying to bomb a target? Send in the CAS. But no one airframe, no one pilot, can do both. An F-16 or an F-18 can do both. This means naturally theyre not as good at the one job, and with bombs they fly like pigs. But then an F-16 can bring a HARM with it on every operation and fling it off if a SAM ambushes them (and this is, btw, pretty widely accepted SOP. So much so that you can set the HARM on most US planes to automatically flip engagement modes from ground or air attack to HARM so the pilot just has to depress the firing switch and engage the SAM. Learned that nifty fact from DCS). Su-35, good as it is, cant do that. AFAIK it cant fire a long range ground attack PGM or an antishipping missile either, F-15s, -16s, -18s, and -35s can do that in the morning, then fly CAP in the afternoon. </p>\n\n<p>Last, probably the most important, the average training and experience of American pilots is some of the best in the world. You dont get a chance to fly in combat until you hit the, IIRC, 2.5yr mark. A year in selection, a year in US training, a few months in with-unit training. Because of the significant investment you most likely wont even get a shot at flying in a combat unit unless you committed to a longer term contract, USAF doesn&#39;t want to spend 2+ years training you just for you to bail at four years. So most pilots who get in stay for the long haul, and taking a second tour on those long contracts is pretty common. So youre looking at guys with 4-5yrs avg service, but a lot longer is just as common! Thats itself pretty rare, Russia and China both AFAIK get pilots into the chair in about half the time. Russia also, because of maint problems, struggles to get flying hours in whereas in the USAF you <em>must</em> grind hours, not just to keep your qualification but because there is a longterm pay thing (its called gating) which depends on your hours flown. You want a bigger paycheck right? The US <em>also</em> has some of the most realistic training facilities in the world with Red Flag in Nevada. They can conduct entirely simulated air wars out there, and record everything that happens for later processing. Other places have similar facilities, but in the US we have both the space (it occurs over like half of Nevada, and is linked to some test ranges in New Mexico as well as the NTC at Ft. Irwin if you wanna impress the mud boys), the technology, and the money to develop such a sophisticated facility. And keep it going. With captured &#39;enemy&#39; aircraft in aggressor squadrons. And simulate entire combined arms operations in it. There was an interview I read from an F-15 pilot during Desert Storm who had done two Red Flag ops in the 1980s.

I haven&#39;t personally read anything commenting on this but I would wager the ramifications on of Iran/Turkey relations would be far more important if it is being taken into major consideration.</p>\n</div>",

Those weaknesses include poor morale, poor generalship and \u201cdisarray\u201d among its political and military leadership.\n\n>\u201cIt is going to be a tough slog, but we\u2019re going to do everything we can as an intelligence agency to provide the kind of intelligence support and sharing that\u2019s going to help the Ukrainians to make progress,\u201d Burns said.\n\n>Burns said that mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin\u2019s mutiny in June had \u201cexposed some of the significant weaknesses in the system that Putin has built.\u201d\n\n> \u201cFor a lot of Russians watching this used to this image of Putin as the arbiter of order, the question was does the emperor have no clothes or at least why does it take so long for him to get dressed,\u201d Burns said.\n\n>Burns\u2019 comments echoed remarks earlier this week by Sir Richard Moore, the head of Britain\u2019s Secret Intelligence Service, known at MI6. Moore said that Putin\u2019s government was beset by \u201cvenality, infighting and callous incompetence\u201d and that the aftermath of Prigozhin\u2019s mutiny had been \u201chumiliating\u201d to Putin. \n\n>Putin will likely try to avoid giving the impression that he is overreacting to the mutiny, while trying to extract what he can of value from Prigozhin\u2019s Wagner network, Burns said. Still, Burns said Prigozhin is likely to see retribution from Putin at some point.\n\n>\u201cPutin is the ultimate apostle of payback,\u201d Burns said. \u201cIf I were Prigozhin, I wouldn\u2019t fire my food taster.\u201d\n\n>Burns said the mutiny presented a \u201conce-in-a-generation opportunity\u201d for CIA recruitment in Russia. The agency recently made its first video post on Telegram, the social media and messaging site developed and widely used in Russia, to let Russians know how to contact it on the \u201cdark web.\u201d Burns said the video was viewed 2.5 million times in the week after it was posted. \n\n>Burns, a diplomat before becoming the CIA chief, has emerged as a key back-channel for the Biden administration\u2019s thorny relationships with Russia and China. He went to Moscow before Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in an attempt to talk Putin\u2019s government out of attacking and, more recently, traveled to Beijing in a bid to keep intelligence channels with China open.\n\n>Burns said that CIA has \u201cmade progress\u201d in rebuilding its intelligence network in China after setbacks in the country. \u201cWe\u2019ve made progress and we\u2019re working very hard over recent years to ensure that we have a strong human intelligence capability to complement what we can do through other methods,\u201d Burns said.\n\n>CIA launched a China Mission Center in 2021 to hone the agency\u2019s focus on \u201can increasingly adversarial Chinese government.\u201d \n\n>Burns added that Chinese President Xi Jinping and his military leadership likely \u201chave doubts about whether they could pull off a successful full-scale invasion of Taiwan at an acceptable cost to them,\u201d Burns said. Putin\u2019s experience in Ukraine has \u201cprobably reinforced some of those doubts,\u201d he said.\n\nDidn\u2019t see it get shared here so article on comments from Moore (excerpt on Russia specific parts): \n\n>[Britain\u2019s MI6 chief says his spies are using AI to disrupt flow of weapons to Russia](https://apnews.com/article/mi6-spy-chief-moore-prague-russia-iran-cfb837ebdfa3db8043dc655cbf3573d5)\n\n> British spies are already using artificial intelligence to hamper the supply of weapons to Russia, the head of Britain\u2019s MI6 agency said Wednesday, predicting that Western intelligence agencies will increasingly have to focus on tracking the malign use of AI by hostile states.\n\n>In a rare public speech, Richard Moore also urged Russians who oppose the invasion of Ukraine to spy for Britain, saying others had already done so since the war began.\n\n>\u201cOur door is always open,\u201d he said.\n\n> Moore also told an audience at the British ambassador\u2019s residence in Prague that Russia\u2019s military campaign in Ukraine had run out of steam and \u201cthere appears to be little prospect of the Russian forces regaining momentum.\u201d\n\n>He said Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive was proving \u201ca hard grind\u201d against strong Russian defenses, but he was optimistic it would succeed.\n\n>Moore said the government of President Vladimir Putin was beset by \u201cvenality, infighting and callous incompetence\u201d and the mutiny by Wagner Group mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin had \u201cexposed the inexorable decay of the unstable autocracy over which Putin presides.\u201d\n\n>He said Putin was \u201cunder pressure\u201d after the brief rebellion and the \u201chumiliating\u201d deal he struck with the help of Belarus to end it.

        "body": "[Ukraine\u2019s new Bradley Fighting Vehicles face damage and quick repairs](https://washingtonpost.com/world/2023/07/20/bradley-ukraine-war-vehicles/):\n\n>The Ukrainian commander of the Bradley infantry fighting vehicle was unloading troops at the front and then planned to transport three injured soldiers back to a field hospital. \u201cBut in that one minute, you suddenly have 30, 40, 50 shells flying in \u2014 everything explodes, soil is flying around, everything lights up,\u201d said the commander, who asked to be identified by his call sign, CZ, in keeping with Ukrainian military protocol.  \n>  \n>The Bradley \u2014 a heavily armed troop transporter that can destroy other armored vehicles \u2014 was damaged by shrapnel, but CZ and his crew survived. In the opening month of Ukraine\u2019s long-anticipated counteroffensive, newly provided Bradleys and German Leopard tanks \u2014 predictably \u2014 have taken hits.  \n>  \n>About a dozen Bradleys have been destroyed, a senior U.S. defense official said. Data from Oryx, a military analysis site that counts losses it has visually confirmed, shows that a couple dozen more have been damaged to varying degrees. Many have been fixed and returned to the battlefield. Some must be sent to Poland for more extensive repairs.  \n>  \n>CZ\u2019s vehicle is now nestled in a wooded area in Ukraine\u2019s southeastern Zaporizhzhia region, one of several secret locations near the front line where the 47th Mechanized Brigade rushes to repair its new Western weaponry.  \n>  \n>The 47th Brigade, the only unit known to have received the Bradleys, was set to get 99 before the start of the counteroffensive, according to leaked U.S. intelligence documents. The United States has committed 190 Bradleys overall, with more than half delivered to operational units in Ukraine, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.  \n>  \n>The U.S. military typically considers a vehicle destroyed when it cannot be salvaged or refurbished after what is commonly called a \u201ccatastrophic kill,\u201d though some parts could still be stripped. Damaged vehicles can be recovered and repaired to working condition.  \n>  \n>Losses of equipment were expected \u2014 and have not rattled Ukrainian commanders who said any hopes that the new weaponry would overwhelm the Russians were misplaced. In a recent interview with The Washington Post, Gen. Valery Zaluzhny, Ukraine\u2019s military chief, said Kyiv didn\u2019t get the vehicles to ride them in parades, and on the battlefield, they\u2019re targets. \u201cYes, we lose them. Not much, let\u2019s say, but there are losses. You can\u2019t get away from that,\u201d he said.  \n>  \n>\u201cIt\u2019s a normal phenomenon,\u201d Zaluzhny said. \u201cDon\u2019t treat the Leopard as a panacea \u2014 that a battalion of Leopards will decide the outcome of this war. Why all of a sudden? Who\u2019s the one who decided that it\u2019s going to solve it?\u201d  \n>  \n>But even amid the early damage, Ukrainian troops have experienced the benefits of the new equipment. In the biggest plus, soldiers said, the Bradley protects everyone inside \u2014 typically, soldiers suffer just minor injuries if the vehicle hits an antitank mine, for example. Each Bradley is designed to carry a three-person crew and six soldiers as passengers.  \n>  \n>In a post on Facebook, Oleg Sentsov, a Ukrainian filmmaker and platoon commander in the 47th Brigade, wrote that he came under heavy artillery fire on a combat mission over the weekend.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://washingtonpost.com/world/2023/07/20/bradley-ukraine-war-vehicles/\">Ukraine\u2019s new Bradley Fighting Vehicles face damage and quick repairs</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Ukrainian commander of the Bradley infantry fighting vehicle was unloading troops at the front and then planned to transport three injured soldiers back to a field hospital. \u201cBut in that one minute, you suddenly have 30, 40, 50 shells flying in \u2014 everything explodes, soil is flying around, everything lights up,\u201d said the commander, who asked to be identified by his call sign, CZ, in keeping with Ukrainian military protocol.  </p>\n\n<p>The Bradley \u2014 a heavily armed troop transporter that can destroy other armored vehicles \u2014 was damaged by shrapnel, but CZ and his crew survived. In the opening month of Ukraine\u2019s long-anticipated counteroffensive, newly provided Bradleys and German Leopard tanks \u2014 predictably \u2014 have taken hits.  </p>\n\n<p>About a dozen Bradleys have been destroyed, a senior U.S. defense official said. Data from Oryx, a military analysis site that counts losses it has visually confirmed, shows that a couple dozen more have been damaged to varying degrees. Many have been fixed and returned to the battlefield. Some must be sent to Poland for more extensive repairs.  </p>\n\n<p>CZ\u2019s vehicle is now nestled in a wooded area in Ukraine\u2019s southeastern Zaporizhzhia region, one of several secret locations near the front line where the 47th Mechanized Brigade rushes to repair its new Western weaponry.  </p>\n\n<p>The 47th Brigade, the only unit known to have received the Bradleys, was set to get 99 before the start of the counteroffensive, according to leaked U.S. intelligence documents. The United States has committed 190 Bradleys overall, with more than half delivered to operational units in Ukraine, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.  </p>\n\n<p>The U.S. military typically considers a vehicle destroyed when it cannot be salvaged or refurbished after what is commonly called a \u201ccatastrophic kill,\u201d though some parts could still be stripped. Damaged vehicles can be recovered and repaired to working condition.  </p>\n\n<p>Losses of equipment were expected \u2014 and have not rattled Ukrainian commanders who said any hopes that the new weaponry would overwhelm the Russians were misplaced. In a recent interview with The Washington Post, Gen. Valery Zaluzhny, Ukraine\u2019s military chief, said Kyiv didn\u2019t get the vehicles to ride them in parades, and on the battlefield, they\u2019re targets. \u201cYes, we lose them. Not much, let\u2019s say, but there are losses. You can\u2019t get away from that,\u201d he said.  </p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a normal phenomenon,\u201d Zaluzhny said. \u201cDon\u2019t treat the Leopard as a panacea \u2014 that a battalion of Leopards will decide the outcome of this war. Why all of a sudden? Who\u2019s the one who decided that it\u2019s going to solve it?\u201d  </p>\n\n<p>But even amid the early damage, Ukrainian troops have experienced the benefits of the new equipment. In the biggest plus, soldiers said, the Bradley protects everyone inside \u2014 typically, soldiers suffer just minor injuries if the vehicle hits an antitank mine, for example. Each Bradley is designed to carry a three-person crew and six soldiers as passengers.  </p>\n\n<p>In a post on Facebook, Oleg Sentsov, a Ukrainian filmmaker and platoon commander in the 47th Brigade, wrote that he came under heavy artillery fire on a combat mission over the weekend. Sentsov and others were wounded by shrapnel, but \u201cBradley saved our lives again,\u201d he said.  </p>\n\n<p>However, \u201cthere are a lot, a lot, a lot of mines \u2014 not thousands, but hundreds of thousands,\u201d CZ said.  </p>\n\n<p>And Bradleys will stop because of damaged tracks depending on what kind of mine they run into, limiting the Ukrainians\u2019 ability to breach the Russians\u2019 defenses with them. Most of the Bradleys getting repaired \u2014 reporters from The Post saw at least six at the wooded location they visited \u2014 were damaged by mine explosions.  </p>\n\n<p>The fighting vehicles were meant to be used in a strategy called combined arms, in which infantry, armor and aviation units work in concert to protect one another and inflict maximum violence.

It's legal to burn the Qura'an, it's legal to call Muhammad a pedo. The third thing, however, is *not* legal, it would likely fall under the actually quite broad hate speech legislation.

With a worsening economic reality for a lot of Europeans and Americans going forward, \"selling\" the Ukraine war to the voting public will be more difficult *especially* if the war bogs down to a complete stalemate at the front.\n\n\n2 - It presumes that the stockpiles and boneyards of the friends of Ukraine is infinite. You say that there is a lot left to give, but it is more important to ask who will give it. The most charitable states, the ones who has given the largest % of their total hardware has been the likes of Poland and the Baltics. The US. spending sounds impressive on paper, but when you take into account what they have in stocks, their unwillingness to \"cross red lines\", and being hesistant to provide supposedly logistically demanding equipment, the US. is not really a charitable donor.

You say that there is a lot left to give, but it is more important to ask who will give it. The most charitable states, the ones who has given the largest % of their total hardware has been the likes of Poland and the Baltics. The US. spending sounds impressive on paper, but when you take into account what they have in stocks, their unwillingness to &quot;cross red lines&quot;, and being hesistant to provide supposedly logistically demanding equipment, the US. is not really a charitable donor.

Which I don't at all agree with. \n\nOne, Ukraine was the one trying throughout the war for quick attacks (Kharkiv, Kherson, Kharkiv again, Kherson again, then the South and Bakhmut). \n\nIf they're trying to quickly punch through a minefield and defenses behind it, and not spend 3 months trying to move 10 km, they need to follow the basic fundamentals, which are the only things that the US top brass would likely have been trying to get them to do. \n\nLearn how combined arms warfare works, especially at the battalion to corps level. Train train train, rehearse rehearse rehearse. Mass forces instead of dispersing on a broad front (hit with closed fist, not open hand). \n\nIn terms of a Ukraine way of war, that's mostly a holdover from the Soviet way of war (which is why their doctrine and their TOE so closely matches Russian approach), but also because if they aren't competent enough to conduct large scale tactical and lower scale operational level combined arms warfare they won't have any other option than fires centric (which is also why the Russians rely on it too).

Not even close. NATO might have provided some equipment and some VERY abbreviated and likely substandard training, but I guarantee nobody in a top NATO military were telling the Ukrainians they should minimize training, etc. Those have been Ukrainian choices from the earliest part of the war, during the 2014-5 war, and used throughout their Soviet period where they didn't prioritize training either.

                        "body": "That's a fair point but practically speaking I don't think they have enough mines to cover the entire shipping lane, especially not at a distance sufficient to offset torpedoes. \n\nModern torpedoes can be pretty long range, with [Russia's primary sub torpedo having a range of 50km, for example.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_53_torpedo#UGST) Given that the targets would be civilian ships, and so slow, large, loud, and likely not equipped with torpedo countermeasures when compared to warships, the torpedoes would likely perform well even at the outermost limits of their range. 50km off the shipping lanes puts you into pretty deep water in the southern Black Sea, where mining is more of a challenge. Even if the Ukrainians constrain themselves to mining a 50km buffer off of the Ukrainian and Moldovan coastlines on the assumption that Russia won't attack any shipping in NATO waters and so the ships would be safe within Turkish, Bulgarian, and Romanian territorial waters until they reached Moldova, that still leaves a 175km long stretch of the Black Sea they would need to mine. Granted it's a pretty shallow stretch, with depths between 50m and 200m, so easier to mine from that perspective.\n\nFor purposes of a rough order of magnitude estimate to try to find a lower bound for how many mines it would take to achieve Ukraine's strategic objectives here, let's call it an average of 50m deep for 175km, or an 8,750,000m^2 2D slice of the Black Sea demarcating the maximum torpedo range boundary from the coastline, including all depths up to the surface.\n\nHow many mines would it take to cover that area? Depends on the mines, and I'm not sure precisely what type of mines the Ukrainians have, but from the few examples of drifting mines that have shown up in the news, it seems they have some form of dirt cheap moored contact mine. Which are the classic, old school spikey looking balls on chains everyone thinks of when they think of naval mines. Contact means that a ship's hull has to actually hit the thing to set it off, unlike influence mines, which can trigger based on sensor feedback and thus are able to cover a somewhat larger area. Although even influence mines are still more or less restricted to hitting things directly above them. It takes really fancy things like the US's retired Mk 47 CAPTOR mines (basically a torpedo with an anchor and an extra sensor package to trigger the torpedo) to cover a larger area, and even the US does not have a current capability for mobile mines after retiring CAPTOR, [although a replacement is in the works.](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/25235/the-u-s-is-getting-back-into-naval-mine-warfare-with-new-sub-launched-and-air-dropped-types)\n\nThe moored contact mines Ukraine has are by contrast of somewhat limited utility against submarines, because the mines need to be set at random depths rather than just at the surface. Or rather than limited utility, another way to look at it is that you need a much larger number of them to cover the same area of the ocean, simply because you need to account for the third dimension of depth. Bottom line is that you don't need just a surface level string of mines to cover the shipping lanes, you need a really long wall that is of varying height. Or at least, you need to mine such a large percentage of that space that it dissuades the Russians from risking the minefield anyway.\n\nYou can effectively think of a contact mine's \"range\" at the surface as the maximum width of the enemy vessel's hull, which is 9.9m for a Kilo. Call it 10 to make the math easy. Since we have to make this 3D for subs, we have to take into account the Kilo's total vertical height, which is about 16m including the sail, which isn't as wide as the rest of the hull but not so much smaller that it's worth accounting for in a rough order of magnitude estimate like this. The mast probably adds another 7.5m, but is much slimmer so I'm just ignoring it for similar reasons. So that adds up to an area of 160m^2 of the Kilo's bow which is at risk of hitting a mine when traveling through a minefield in a straight line. I'm also ignoring the effects of the sub turning because again this is a ROM estimate. That means it would take around 54,688 contact mines to cover 100% of the 8.75 million meters square area required to screen shipping along the coast that I described above. Not that you need to cover 100% to deny area access, nor that every mine would be placed exactly as part of a continuous wall rather than placed randomly throughout the potential theater of operations, but the 100% figure is a good rough baseline for figuring out the chances of a sub hitting any of the mines when crossing the minefield at any random point.\n\n[To get a sense of the scale of mines Ukraine has deployed thus far, Russia reported having mapped out 370 Ukrainian naval mines last year in the Black Sea.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/11/sea-mines-ukraine-waters-russia-war-black-sea) Assuming the Russians have only detected 10% and the Ukrainians have not massively increased the number deployed, then there would be around 3700 Ukrainian mines in the Black Sea. Let's say they've added another 1700 in the last year. These figures include mines intended to fend off amphibious invasion. Even assuming 100% of those existing mines were instead deployed to protect shipping, that would still only hold the Kilos something like 10% at risk for crossing the 50km range line, not even taking into account the Kilo's ability to detect and evade or disable moored contact mines. Moored contact mines are relatively easy to detect and disable since they are harder to set off by accident than influence mines and they are easier to detect with sonar than bottom mines.\n\n10%, and that's with a wildly optimistic number of mines not detected by Russia, a correspondingly wildly optimistic estimate of how many additional mines they've been able to lay down, ignoring alternative demands for mines like protecting against amphibious assault, assuming the Ukrainians would be able to lay down the minefield without the Russians destroying the minelayers, and assuming the Russians do not posses any capacity to demine the minefields, even with total freedom of action at depths. The subs also could likely afford to proceed very slowly through the minefields with divers clearing the way because there are no other Ukrainian naval assets that can hold them at threat as they do so.\n\nAll of which suggests that 10% may be a vast overestimate of what Ukraine could cover currently. And yet that vastly overestimated 10% risk seems too low to deter Russia, because they only really need to sink one ship to get the point across, so it's not like they'd need to risk crossing the minefield repeatedly. Plus the risk is mostly concentrated in the first crossing, when a clear path needs to be found. Once it's found, they simply need to monitor for additional mining activity in the area to know if their clear route has potentially been compromised and needs to be recleared. Even losing one Kilo to mines would probably be worth the benefits gained from denying Ukraine grain revenue. At least from Putin and the other Russian leaders' perspectives. \n\nAnd the Russians only need to sink one commercial ship because the threat to shipping doesn't need to be particularly large to prevent insurance companies from insuring ships traveling to Ukraine. Even a single digit chance of any given ship being sunk is likely high enough to dissuade insurers, particularly because there are enormous, difficult-to-quantify uncertainties around any risk assessment that depends on how two national navies perform against each other during a war.\n\nEdit: oh, and I forgot, but the 175km line I described is actually just barely outside of Ukrainian and Moldovan [territorial waters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_waters), which extend to 24 nautical miles out from the coast, which is around 45km, and so is less than the 50km UGST torpedo range. Which is important because Ukraine can legally mine international waters because they are at war, otherwise it would be illegal. It would also potentially be illegal for them to mine *within* Moldova's territorial waters as a neutral state to the current conflict, but placing the minefields closer to the 50km range around Moldova sidesteps the issue. But also makes the minefield placement more predictable from the Russians' perspective.",
                        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>That&#39;s a fair point but practically speaking I don&#39;t think they have enough mines to cover the entire shipping lane, especially not at a distance sufficient to offset torpedoes. </p>\n\n<p>Modern torpedoes can be pretty long range, with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_53_torpedo#UGST\">Russia&#39;s primary sub torpedo having a range of 50km, for example.</a> Given that the targets would be civilian ships, and so slow, large, loud, and likely not equipped with torpedo countermeasures when compared to warships, the torpedoes would likely perform well even at the outermost limits of their range. 50km off the shipping lanes puts you into pretty deep water in the southern Black Sea, where mining is more of a challenge. Even if the Ukrainians constrain themselves to mining a 50km buffer off of the Ukrainian and Moldovan coastlines on the assumption that Russia won&#39;t attack any shipping in NATO waters and so the ships would be safe within Turkish, Bulgarian, and Romanian territorial waters until they reached Moldova, that still leaves a 175km long stretch of the Black Sea they would need to mine. Granted it&#39;s a pretty shallow stretch, with depths between 50m and 200m, so easier to mine from that perspective.</p>\n\n<p>For purposes of a rough order of magnitude estimate to try to find a lower bound for how many mines it would take to achieve Ukraine&#39;s strategic objectives here, let&#39;s call it an average of 50m deep for 175km, or an 8,750,000m<sup>2</sup> 2D slice of the Black Sea demarcating the maximum torpedo range boundary from the coastline, including all depths up to the surface.</p>\n\n<p>How many mines would it take to cover that area? Depends on the mines, and I&#39;m not sure precisely what type of mines the Ukrainians have, but from the few examples of drifting mines that have shown up in the news, it seems they have some form of dirt cheap moored contact mine. Which are the classic, old school spikey looking balls on chains everyone thinks of when they think of naval mines. Contact means that a ship&#39;s hull has to actually hit the thing to set it off, unlike influence mines, which can trigger based on sensor feedback and thus are able to cover a somewhat larger area. Although even influence mines are still more or less restricted to hitting things directly above them. It takes really fancy things like the US&#39;s retired Mk 47 CAPTOR mines (basically a torpedo with an anchor and an extra sensor package to trigger the torpedo) to cover a larger area, and even the US does not have a current capability for mobile mines after retiring CAPTOR, <a href=\"https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/25235/the-u-s-is-getting-back-into-naval-mine-warfare-with-new-sub-launched-and-air-dropped-types\">although a replacement is in the works.</a></p>\n\n<p>The moored contact mines Ukraine has are by contrast of somewhat limited utility against submarines, because the mines need to be set at random depths rather than just at the surface. Or rather than limited utility, another way to look at it is that you need a much larger number of them to cover the same area of the ocean, simply because you need to account for the third dimension of depth. Bottom line is that you don&#39;t need just a surface level string of mines to cover the shipping lanes, you need a really long wall that is of varying height. Or at least, you need to mine such a large percentage of that space that it dissuades the Russians from risking the minefield anyway.</p>\n\n<p>You can effectively think of a contact mine&#39;s &quot;range&quot; at the surface as the maximum width of the enemy vessel&#39;s hull, which is 9.9m for a Kilo. Call it 10 to make the math easy. Since we have to make this 3D for subs, we have to take into account the Kilo&#39;s total vertical height, which is about 16m including the sail, which isn&#39;t as wide as the rest of the hull but not so much smaller that it&#39;s worth accounting for in a rough order of magnitude estimate like this. The mast probably adds another 7.5m, but is much slimmer so I&#39;m just ignoring it for similar reasons. So that adds up to an area of 160m<sup>2</sup> of the Kilo&#39;s bow which is at risk of hitting a mine when traveling through a minefield in a straight line. I&#39;m also ignoring the effects of the sub turning because again this is a ROM estimate. That means it would take around 54,688 contact mines to cover 100% of the 8.75 million meters square area required to screen shipping along the coast that I described above.

The idea of Ukraine using F-16s flown by freshly trained pilots to execute SEAD against Russia is a non-starter.
