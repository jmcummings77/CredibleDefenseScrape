Obviously there are error bars and possible bias in such reports etc. [You can see visualization here](https://taw.github.io/open-source-adventures/episode-51/).\n\nIt's some combination of Russia running low on combat vehicles, being a lot more careful with the vehicles they have remaining, and getting tons of freshly mobilized cannon fodder and happily throwing their lives away, September-October having a lot of captures in big offensives, weather restricting mechanized operations more than infantry operations etc.\n\nAnyway, there's an interesting thing to consider:\n\nFor vehicles we have independent source like Oryx so we can know Ukrainian data is fairly reliable if we assume Oryx gets some % of the total, Ukrainian data as a time series has peak correlation of about 0.3 with Oryx numbers 7 days later.\n\nFor personnel lost we didn't have any independent confirmation yet, so for all we knew they could be really off, but an independent confirmation is coming. When next wave of mobilization happens, that's more or less when Russia lost 300k KIA + WIA + noncombat losses between waves. If it happens soon like February or March, this strongly implies that Russia is taking massive personnel losses. If they can make it to late summer without another wave of mobilization or such, then maybe Ukrainian numbers are significantly biased.\n\nUkraine claims they're killing ~15k Russians per month post-mobilization, so that's maybe 50k total Russian personnel losses in combat per month, so it would take 6 months to physically eliminate all of them. Or a bit less as they surely suffer a lot of non-combat attrition as well. Then again, they also have some recruitment between waves like inmates, occasional vatnik volunteers, forced mobilization of occupied population in violation of Geneva Conventions etc.\n\nThe first wave was end of September, so 6 months would be end of March.\n\nAlso Arestovych claimed that it would take 3 months for Russia to need another mobilization wave, but he's been consistently rather optimistic with his timelines, and I don't see how that would even add up, even assuming Ukrainian MOD data is perfectly fine and throwing significant noncombat losses on top of that.\n\nWhatever the date is, it will be our first independent data source for Russian personnel losses.",

That may be enough for the economy to level off or grow slightly next year, after a more than 30% contraction this year, he said.\n\n>>\u201cWe see that the economy \u2014 and this is an amazing thing \u2014 shows adaptability, resilience and flexibility,\u201d Pyshnyi said in his office in downtown Kyiv last week as air-raid sirens sounded across the capital. \u201cUkrainians are modeling unique behavior in unprecedentedly stressful situations.\u201d\n\n>Even with the Economy Ministry questioning whether next year\u2019s growth forecasts will materialize, Pyshnyi said there is reason for optimism. He attributed a slower-than-expected decline in the third quarter to the efficiency of air-defense systems, relatively quick repairs to the power grid, and the unbreakable will of the people.\n\n>In the best-case scenario, the central bank sees the economy expanding as much as by 1% next year, matching the International Monetary Fund\u2019s outlook, according to Pyshnyi.\n\n>>\u201cWe\u2019ve already discussed that this resilience driver should be taken into account\u201d by the central bank\u2019s research staff, he said. \u201cWe are kind of a laboratory\u201d that the world can study to improve forecasting, he said.\n\n\n>One indication that households and business are learning to cope with the war\u2019s impact is monthly increases in payment-card transactions despite increasingly frequent power outages, Pyshnyi said. Another is the number of diesel generators imported this year. Some 500,000 are helping the country continue working in the face of hours-long blackouts, according to the Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal. \n\n>Even with the higher cost of using diesel generators, year-end consumer inflation will probably come in at about 28%, below the current 30% forecast, Pyshnyi said. \n\n> The \u201ctendency toward improvement,\u201d however, is no reason to cut interest rates yet, he said, as the monetary policy committee has a unanimous understanding that the balance of inflation risk is upward. Price growth is likely to accelerate in the first quarter, before starting to slow in the second quarter, he said.\n\n>> \u201cAs of today, we don\u2019t see grounds for revising the key policy rate in the coming four months,\u201d he said. \n\n>A key driver for the economy next year will be unlocking billions of dollars in loans from the International Monetary Fund, he said. \n\n>The government in Kyiv plans to work with an IMF mission in February and move to review the provisional program the following month. Part of the discussion is whether the Washington-based lender will stick to its tenet of not lending funds to countries at war. Pyshnyi said there was a chance to come to an agreement.\n\n>>\u201cThe discussion taking place now within the International Monetary Fund gives us optimism,\u201d Pyshnyi said. \u201cWe are now rewriting rules. This full-scale war should force a rethinking of regulations and approaches not only in international financial organizations, but also in international politics.\u201d\n\nA few thoughts:\n\n1. GDP is a really imperfect tool of measuring the damage done to economies such as Russia\u2019s and Ukraine\u2019s.\n2. Even still, on first blush these forecasts seem optimistic to me personally, but I\u2019ve habitually overestimated the Russian economy and underestimated Ukrainian resilience throughout this war, so perhaps it\u2019s attainable. Still skeptical, though.\n3. The damage done to Ukraine\u2019s fundamentally agrarian economy may be the catalyst for a transformation towards a more services based economy which would make it a key EU partner.

Don&#39;t get involved if you don&#39;t want a discussion.</p>\n\n<p>Your linked article doesn&#39;t specifically discuss what we&#39;re discussing. It&#39;s not just about not using the Euro.</p>\n</div>",

Most forums tend to push towards the most extreme views. People get a dopamine hit or \"buzz\" of off saying stuff that is popular, they also get a buzz of off seeing their views repeated back to them in a popular forum. So you get these kind of emotional bandwagons that are just people addicted to repeating hot takes and getting up votes for them. Its the same neurological addiction pathways active in gambling or computer gaming. As much as dopamine is a please hormone, it also teaches the brain where to lay down more axions thus creating habitual pathways people keep returning too. \n\nMost people can see it in the opposite politics too them. Few see it in their own behaviours. \n\nPeople post the most populist \"Russia dumb\" takes and everyone gets in to agree with FOMO, fear of missing out on a trend.",

If I could press a button and make the world's standard of living and general legal structure the same as what the average American experiences, I'd do so in a heartbeat. \n\nStatistically speaking, some Europeans' lives would get worse- the same applies for some people in Australia/Japan/South Korea/\"the West\". Others in those countries would see their lives improve.\n\n*Almost everyone in Africa would be living better.* Almost everyone in Asia, almost everyone in South America. This is fairly self-evident.\n\nBut what would they say about that in China, or North Korea? Sure, the average GDP might rise- but they'd argue that it'd be \"chaos\", that our \"freedoms\" aren't worth that much, that a more directly controlling government is better.\n\nWhat we see there is a *value difference.* The different groups have different baseline ideas about what's good and bad. I think my country is above average in the world by my country's own standards. Not every country has this privilege, to be clear- you go to a place like Honduras or Venezuela, and they'll often tell you they wish they could be anywhere else.\n\nNow go to Russia. Heck, [look at their propaganda aimed at convincing people not to move to America.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFrLRRygt7M) Exaggerated and ridiculous as it may be, the *messaging* is clear: anti-LGBT, anti-vegetarian, anti-affirmative action, anti-childfree. Anti-freedom to a small extent, too- or at the very least, anti-the West's version of freedom, where equality is supported by the government and alternative lifestyles are respected.\n\nUkraine was moving to the West. If you're a typical (or perhaps stereotypical) Russian, are you going to think that's a good thing? Or a bad thing?\n\nMost great powers think that the world is better wherever they go, whenever they control things. The people living in the conquered country are \"wrong\", they must be \"taught\". \"Be traditional, don't deviate\"- or perhaps \"Deviate, don't be traditional\", when a liberal country is invading a conservative one.\n\nIn the eyes of a man like Putin, if he keeps Ukraine from becoming more like the West, he's doing them a favor. His culture has the best ideas, he's spreading it to them, he's keeping away the gays and keeping the faith and keeping the Russian manliness and keeping the respect for tradition.\n\nWe think all that's awful! So we're supporting the other side of the war.\n\n---\n\nHaving said all that, I want to point out something rather important.\n\nThis pattern with the great powers is starting to see a shift, courtesy of the West.\n\nIn the past few generations, we've seen a major change in how Western powers interact with each other. In WWII, Germany sought to gain more land for their people. In years past, Britain and France warred with each other over global influence.\n\nNowadays, we're realizing something rather important: globalization has reached a point where the cultures of our countries are more or less compatible. Countries in the EU all have the same basic respect for human rights, freedom, and democracy. There's a bit of a spectrum here- Hungary being at the bottom- but broadly speaking, even they're a democracy with decent rights compared to the world at large.\n\nSo now, we're trying something rather new. North America, Europe, Australia, Japan, South Korea, and others- we're all realizing that if we're just friends with each other, we can completely outcompete our rivals. This is *uniquely easy for us-* we respect individual freedom and diversity (to varying extents), so it's easy to accept people doing things differently in different countries. **Instead of conquering countries, we just show off how much better our lives are.** Then countries in the world that are interested in that lifestyle make changes on their own, and then we grow closer to them until they formally join our structures. You could call it a \"soft empire\", built on shared values instead of shared governance.\n\nThis was happening to Ukraine, as it did in so many other Soviet bloc countries, when Russia invaded. In Putin's eyes, the liberal Western lifestyle is a dangerous temptation away from traditional values. If he does nothing, Ukraine will be lost. If he can at least \"save\" the Russian-speaking population of Ukraine, then he'll have done \"good\". The West needs to be \"punished\" for their cynical, godless evils like being pro-LGBT or abandoning traditional roles and beliefs- even if it hurts Russia.\n\nAs they say, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. More often than not, confusing actions by a villainous world leader can be explained by a combination of values differences and the sunk cost fallacy (or rather, the fact that a sunk cost for no gain is political suicide in every country).",

The people living in the conquered country are &quot;wrong&quot;, they must be &quot;taught&quot;. &quot;Be traditional, don&#39;t deviate&quot;- or perhaps &quot;Deviate, don&#39;t be traditional&quot;, when a liberal country is invading a conservative one.</p>\n\n<p>In the eyes of a man like Putin, if he keeps Ukraine from becoming more like the West, he&#39;s doing them a favor. His culture has the best ideas, he&#39;s spreading it to them, he&#39;s keeping away the gays and keeping the faith and keeping the Russian manliness and keeping the respect for tradition.</p>\n\n<p>We think all that&#39;s awful! So we&#39;re supporting the other side of the war.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Having said all that, I want to point out something rather important.</p>\n\n<p>This pattern with the great powers is starting to see a shift, courtesy of the West.</p>\n\n<p>In the past few generations, we&#39;ve seen a major change in how Western powers interact with each other. In WWII, Germany sought to gain more land for their people. In years past, Britain and France warred with each other over global influence.</p>\n\n<p>Nowadays, we&#39;re realizing something rather important: globalization has reached a point where the cultures of our countries are more or less compatible. Countries in the EU all have the same basic respect for human rights, freedom, and democracy. There&#39;s a bit of a spectrum here- Hungary being at the bottom- but broadly speaking, even they&#39;re a democracy with decent rights compared to the world at large.</p>\n\n<p>So now, we&#39;re trying something rather new. North America, Europe, Australia, Japan, South Korea, and others- we&#39;re all realizing that if we&#39;re just friends with each other, we can completely outcompete our rivals. This is <em>uniquely easy for us-</em> we respect individual freedom and diversity (to varying extents), so it&#39;s easy to accept people doing things differently in different countries. <strong>Instead of conquering countries, we just show off how much better our lives are.</strong> Then countries in the world that are interested in that lifestyle make changes on their own, and then we grow closer to them until they formally join our structures. You could call it a &quot;soft empire&quot;, built on shared values instead of shared governance.</p>\n\n<p>This was happening to Ukraine, as it did in so many other Soviet bloc countries, when Russia invaded. In Putin&#39;s eyes, the liberal Western lifestyle is a dangerous temptation away from traditional values. If he does nothing, Ukraine will be lost. If he can at least &quot;save&quot; the Russian-speaking population of Ukraine, then he&#39;ll have done &quot;good&quot;. The West needs to be &quot;punished&quot; for their cynical, godless evils like being pro-LGBT or abandoning traditional roles and beliefs- even if it hurts Russia.</p>\n\n<p>As they say, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. More often than not, confusing actions by a villainous world leader can be explained by a combination of values differences and the sunk cost fallacy (or rather, the fact that a sunk cost for no gain is political suicide in every country).</p>\n</div>",

            "body": "It's a cultural thing, and this person on Twitter wrote a long article about it, I recommend reading it there with pictures etc. \n\n\nhttps://twitter.com/kamilkazani/status/1516162437455654913\n\nSome Western analysts unfamiliar with Eastern European cultural context perceive Z-war as an accident. They presume that Russian invasion results from some sort of \"misunderstanding\" or mistake which can be resolved via negotiations\ud83e\uddf5\n\nThat's a textbook example of wishful thinking. Why would such a renowned analyst as Luttwak argue that \"the war need not continue\"? Because *he* doesn't need it to continue. I don't need it -> Nobody needs it -> A peaceful settlement is possible. But that's not how it works\n\nYou may want to stop this war ASAP, but it's not up to you to decide. It's up to Russia which invaded Ukraine for a reason. And this reason remains irrespective of Putin or Zelensky, CSTO or NATO, Siloviki or Mail. It's not a war of regimes. It's a war of memes\n\nThe motivation behind Z-war is not \"security\", \"alliances\" or even political affiliation. It's the need to extinguish wrong cultural memes and  impose correct ones. That's why Z-war has such a wide popular support and why Russians so easily agreed for a total war against Ukraine\n\nArrogant it may sound, I think that in order to understand  cultural context, you need to consume content in a language of the country. Those analysts who consume content in Russian typically view Z-war as inevitable. They saw it coming. But those who don't, are usually surprised\n\n\"Z-war happened because Russia never accepted existence of Ukraine in the first place. And by \"Russia\" I mean not only the state, but also the people, especially the cultural elites. It was the so much glorified cultural elite that prepared this war rather than ignorant masses\n\nThey argued or implied that Ukraine is a fake nation with fake/inferior culture and history. In other words, the real problem is that Ukrainians stick to inferior memes. Worst of all, they could have upgraded and accepted superior, Russian memes, but they refuse to\n\nRussian invasion of Ukraine can be understood only in cultural context. Kremlin didn't plan for a war, it planned to \"liberate\" Ukraine, save it by imposing the correct memes. But it turned out that Ukrainians didn't want to be saved. That's how Special Operation turned into war\n\nInitial Kremlin's assumption was that Ukraine isn't irredeemable. It's a country of somewhat inferior Russians controlled by the \"Nazis\"  who  brainwashed the rest into submission. But what Ukrainians secretly want is to drop the farce of \"Ukraine\" and become normal (=Russian)\n\nTo understand the logic behind Z-invasion you have to keep in mind that Russianness = normality. When you are Russified you just become normal. Z-invasion was planned as a gift or humanitarian operation. That's why Ukrainian resistance is so shocking. They don't want to be norma\n\nUkrainian ingratitude and refusal to become Russians explains the rapid escalation of violence by the Russian military.\n\nLet me quote a correspondent of \"All-Russian TV and Radio Broadcasting Company\" with 577 158 followers:\n\n\"Mariupol. The Apocalypse District. Should we show it to the entire world?\n\nYes. Let Kiev, Lvov, Poltava, Ternopol see: if a city doesn't surrender, it will be destroyed\"\n\nOr this guy very close to the Kremlin:\n\n\"When Zdolbunov is bombed, I won't feel bad. They signed out from the Russian nation. And in order to sign into the Russians again, Ukraine will pay a huge price. I think the same of Harkov, Kiev, Dniepropetrovsk, Rovno and Ivano-Frankovsk\"\n\nTo be fair Russia always fought like this - with extreme disregard towards any ethical or legal norms. But since it launched most of its total wars against non-White/non-Christian people like the Syrian Sunni, nobody cared (I cropped the photo, it's much worse). But why Ukraine?\n\nWe can start our discussion with Brodsky. He's relatively well known in the West largely due to winning a Nobel prize in literature. But his cultural influence is probably underestimated there. Brodsky was not just a poet, he was *the* last great poet of Russian literary canon\n\nAfter being persecuted by the Soviet authorities, Brodsky emigrated to the US. He was showered with prizes, honours and awards. Here he won the Nobel Prize and became the US Poet Laureate. Both his literary talents and victimhood record helped a lot in his American career\n\nThat's a poem Brodsky read in Palo Alto in 1992. Although written and published in the US, the poem \"On Ukrainian independence\" is probably the most widely quoted and impactful political manifesto of the post-Soviet Russia. It's *super* nationalist\n\nWhich translation of Brodsky's \"On Ukrainian independence\" shall I give? I chose this one. It's not literal, it's much better. A literal translation would be suboptimal for an audience with  different cultural background, while this one is understandable\n\nIn this poem Brodsky sends multiple messages to Ukrainians (called with slur \"Khokhly\"). He:\n\n1. Tells Ukrainians to go fuck themselves\n2. Predicts: \"you, scum will be gangbanged by Poles and Germans\"\n3. Wonders if he should spit in Dnieper in order to make it flow backwards\n\nBrodsky called his poem \"risky\". And yet, it correctly reflected attitude of much of Russian society towards Ukraine. After 2014 it became especially relevant and was repeatedly endorsed by the media and authorities like the Russian parliament newspaper\n\nWhat I find more interesting however, is the two final lines of Brodsky's poem.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>It&#39;s a cultural thing, and this person on Twitter wrote a long article about it, I recommend reading it there with pictures etc. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kamilkazani/status/1516162437455654913\">https://twitter.com/kamilkazani/status/1516162437455654913</a></p>\n\n<p>Some Western analysts unfamiliar with Eastern European cultural context perceive Z-war as an accident. They presume that Russian invasion results from some sort of &quot;misunderstanding&quot; or mistake which can be resolved via negotiations\ud83e\uddf5</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s a textbook example of wishful thinking. Why would such a renowned analyst as Luttwak argue that &quot;the war need not continue&quot;? Because <em>he</em> doesn&#39;t need it to continue. I don&#39;t need it -&gt; Nobody needs it -&gt; A peaceful settlement is possible. But that&#39;s not how it works</p>\n\n<p>You may want to stop this war ASAP, but it&#39;s not up to you to decide. It&#39;s up to Russia which invaded Ukraine for a reason. And this reason remains irrespective of Putin or Zelensky, CSTO or NATO, Siloviki or Mail. It&#39;s not a war of regimes. It&#39;s a war of memes</p>\n\n<p>The motivation behind Z-war is not &quot;security&quot;, &quot;alliances&quot; or even political affiliation. It&#39;s the need to extinguish wrong cultural memes and  impose correct ones. That&#39;s why Z-war has such a wide popular support and why Russians so easily agreed for a total war against Ukraine</p>\n\n<p>Arrogant it may sound, I think that in order to understand  cultural context, you need to consume content in a language of the country. Those analysts who consume content in Russian typically view Z-war as inevitable. They saw it coming. But those who don&#39;t, are usually surprised</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Z-war happened because Russia never accepted existence of Ukraine in the first place. And by &quot;Russia&quot; I mean not only the state, but also the people, especially the cultural elites. It was the so much glorified cultural elite that prepared this war rather than ignorant masses</p>\n\n<p>They argued or implied that Ukraine is a fake nation with fake/inferior culture and history. In other words, the real problem is that Ukrainians stick to inferior memes. Worst of all, they could have upgraded and accepted superior, Russian memes, but they refuse to</p>\n\n<p>Russian invasion of Ukraine can be understood only in cultural context. Kremlin didn&#39;t plan for a war, it planned to &quot;liberate&quot; Ukraine, save it by imposing the correct memes. But it turned out that Ukrainians didn&#39;t want to be saved. That&#39;s how Special Operation turned into war</p>\n\n<p>Initial Kremlin&#39;s assumption was that Ukraine isn&#39;t irredeemable. It&#39;s a country of somewhat inferior Russians controlled by the &quot;Nazis&quot;  who  brainwashed the rest into submission. But what Ukrainians secretly want is to drop the farce of &quot;Ukraine&quot; and become normal (=Russian)</p>\n\n<p>To understand the logic behind Z-invasion you have to keep in mind that Russianness = normality. When you are Russified you just become normal. Z-invasion was planned as a gift or humanitarian operation. That&#39;s why Ukrainian resistance is so shocking. They don&#39;t want to be norma</p>\n\n<p>Ukrainian ingratitude and refusal to become Russians explains the rapid escalation of violence by the Russian military.</p>\n\n<p>Let me quote a correspondent of &quot;All-Russian TV and Radio Broadcasting Company&quot; with 577 158 followers:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Mariupol. The Apocalypse District. Should we show it to the entire world?</p>\n\n<p>Yes. Let Kiev, Lvov, Poltava, Ternopol see: if a city doesn&#39;t surrender, it will be destroyed&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Or this guy very close to the Kremlin:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;When Zdolbunov is bombed, I won&#39;t feel bad. They signed out from the Russian nation. And in order to sign into the Russians again, Ukraine will pay a huge price. I think the same of Harkov, Kiev, Dniepropetrovsk, Rovno and Ivano-Frankovsk&quot;</p>\n\n<p>To be fair Russia always fought like this - with extreme disregard towards any ethical or legal norms. But since it launched most of its total wars against non-White/non-Christian people like the Syrian Sunni, nobody cared (I cropped the photo, it&#39;s much worse). But why Ukraine?</p>\n\n<p>We can start our discussion with Brodsky. He&#39;s relatively well known in the West largely due to winning a Nobel prize in literature. But his cultural influence is probably underestimated there. Brodsky was not just a poet, he was <em>the</em> last great poet of Russian literary canon</p>\n\n<p>After being persecuted by the Soviet authorities, Brodsky emigrated to the US. He was showered with prizes, honours and awards. Here he won the Nobel Prize and became the US Poet Laureate. Both his literary talents and victimhood record helped a lot in his American career</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s a poem Brodsky read in Palo Alto in 1992. Although written and published in the US, the poem &quot;On Ukrainian independence&quot; is probably the most widely quoted and impactful political manifesto of the post-Soviet Russia. It&#39;s <em>super</em> nationalist</p>\n\n<p>Which translation of Brodsky&#39;s &quot;On Ukrainian independence&quot; shall I give? I chose this one. It&#39;s not literal, it&#39;s much better. A literal translation would be suboptimal for an audience with  different cultural background, while this one is understandable</p>\n\n<p>In this poem Brodsky sends multiple messages to Ukrainians (called with slur &quot;Khokhly&quot;). He:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Tells Ukrainians to go fuck themselves</li>\n<li>Predicts: &quot;you, scum will be gangbanged by Poles and Germans&quot;</li>\n<li>Wonders if he should spit in Dnieper in order to make it flow backwards</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Brodsky called his poem &quot;risky&quot;. And yet, it correctly reflected attitude of much of Russian society towards Ukraine. After 2014 it became especially relevant and was repeatedly endorsed by the media and authorities like the Russian parliament newspaper</p>\n\n<p>What I find more interesting however, is the two final lines of Brodsky&#39;s poem. They literally tell to Ukrainians:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;When you are dying and scratching your deathbed, you&#39;ll be wheezing Alexander&#39;s lines and not the Taras&#39; bullshit&quot;</p>\n\n<p>What does he mean by that?</p>\n\n<p>Brodsky is referring to Alexander Pushkin and Taras Shevchenko:  national poets of Russia and Ukraine respectively.

Whenever I try to write anything on the subject it inevitably turns into an uncontrollable wall of text just because it is too complex to simplify, and I have no time for that at the moment. But I will try to be extra concise and simple. \n\nRussia as a state and its national traits come from a source much older than Pushkin. It has born from the Muscovite autocracy that had a sort of a head start after a fall-off of the Mongol control and a population\\elite with a stronger focus on obedience and subjugation than its neighbors. There were many culturally and even ethnically (tribally) different Rus city-states (such as Novgorod, Pskov, Ryazan, etc.) that were ultimately subjugated by Muscovy. Its impulse for conquest and subjugation continued and never ceased. I would also largely agree with Galeev on the thesis that the (increase of) centralization\\globalization of the subjugated former-Rus peoples and creation of a modern \"Russky\" person was enabled by the formation of a more standardized language and creation of literature.

There were many culturally and even ethnically (tribally) different Rus city-states (such as Novgorod, Pskov, Ryazan, etc.) that were ultimately subjugated by Muscovy. Its impulse for conquest and subjugation continued and never ceased. I would also largely agree with Galeev on the thesis that the (increase of) centralization\\globalization of the subjugated former-Rus peoples and creation of a modern &quot;Russky&quot; person was enabled by the formation of a more standardized language and creation of literature.

It has twice the population of Europe. 14,000 people is a tiny number in comparison to China. The fact that a national news outlet like Xinhua covered a lockdown involving 14,000, people in a country of 1.4 billion, gives you an idea of how rare this was at the time.\n\nThe \"Social Welfare Institutes\" you reference are elderly care homes.

In Taiwan, the government used cell phone location data to track down close contacts of infected people, who then underwent mandatory quarantine.\n\nThe basic fact is that in China, from about April 2020 into 2022, you could go about your life pretty much as normal, going to work in person, eating at restaurants, going to bars, sports events, concerts, etc., and going on vacation within the country.

In this context it has been reasonable for the West to stick to the existing level of support, as evidently it has been working and has not caused Russia to do something really stupid (and escalate).

The area in modern Ukraine had a distinctly different path than the area around the Grand Duchy of Moscow. The forerunners to the modern Ukrainian identity, distinct from the Kievan Rus, is the Cossack Hetmanate, which suffered a fate that Russia appears to desire a repeat of. Even after being subsumed by the Russian Empire (i.e., Muscovy), the Ukrainian identity remained distinct, such that it reemerged in the immediate aftermath of the collapse of the Russian Empire. The USSR reincorporated Ukraine into a Russo-centric Empire based out of Moscow, but also formalized the Ukrainian identity with its pseudo-federal model. \n\n\nSo, to basically, modern Ukrainian and Russian are both descendants of the old Kievan Rus distinguished by differing histories and political realities over centuries. The Russian perspective is that it is the rightful inheritor of the Kievan Rus legacy, and that Ukrainian is an unfortunate splinter created by (and continuing to exist as a result of) foreign meddling. The Ukrainian perspective is that its existence is legitimate, and the Russian perspective is Moscovite chauvinism. \n\n\nTL;DR: it's complicated, and those complications ultimately produced the conflict we're witnessing (along with a lot of other confounding factors).\n\n\nW.r.t. Khrushchev - he was born and raised in Western Russia, only bring assigned to Ukraine when he was 44. He'd likely consider himself Russian. A Ukrainian nationalist would likely consider him another in a long line of Moscovite governors.\n\n\nEdit: Wikipedia once again offers a good high level summary of events https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_nationalism",

Even after being subsumed by the Russian Empire (i.e., Muscovy), the Ukrainian identity remained distinct, such that it reemerged in the immediate aftermath of the collapse of the Russian Empire. The USSR reincorporated Ukraine into a Russo-centric Empire based out of Moscow, but also formalized the Ukrainian identity with its pseudo-federal model. </p>\n\n<p>So, to basically, modern Ukrainian and Russian are both descendants of the old Kievan Rus distinguished by differing histories and political realities over centuries. The Russian perspective is that it is the rightful inheritor of the Kievan Rus legacy, and that Ukrainian is an unfortunate splinter created by (and continuing to exist as a result of) foreign meddling. The Ukrainian perspective is that its existence is legitimate, and the Russian perspective is Moscovite chauvinism. </p>\n\n<p>TL;DR: it&#39;s complicated, and those complications ultimately produced the conflict we&#39;re witnessing (along with a lot of other confounding factors).</p>\n\n<p>W.r.t. Khrushchev - he was born and raised in Western Russia, only bring assigned to Ukraine when he was 44. He&#39;d likely consider himself Russian. A Ukrainian nationalist would likely consider him another in a long line of Moscovite governors.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Wikipedia once again offers a good high level summary of events <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_nationalism\">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_nationalism</a></p>\n</div>",
