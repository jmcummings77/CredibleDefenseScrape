The missile was first reported yesterday to have struck civilians. Sometime last night/this morning, a bunch of Ukrainian telegrams started writing about a tragedy that occurred. Today, photos of dead soldiers from the strike began emerging, and Ukraine officially recognized that elements of the 128th brigade were hit. Preliminary casualty estimates are at least 20 soldiers of the 128th were killed, and presumably many were wounded:\n\n[https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2023/11/4/7427221/](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2023/11/4/7427221/) (Russia attacks Ukrainian soldiers who had gathered for awards ceremony: over 20 fighters killed)\n\n[https://nitter.poast.org/IAPonomarenko/status/1720885948026650810#m](https://nitter.poast.org/IAPonomarenko/status/1720885948026650810#m)\n\n[https://nitter.poast.org/Militarylandnet/status/1720889753254375637#m](https://nitter.poast.org/Militarylandnet/status/1720889753254375637#m)\n\nThis event is especially notable in how preventable it was. Some Ukrainian officer decided that having an awards ceremony 18km from the frontlines would be fine, despite evidence of Russia's ISR/drone capabilities. Ukraine lost at least a platoon's worth of some of their best soldiers in a sloppy and what some are calling a \"Soviet-style\" mistake.

Something pointed out by one person sharing it is that [\"Obviously there's IDF troops on the ground outside tanks in Gaza, there's photos \\(from the military, albeit\\), but almost every single video that actually comes out of the fighting, it's Israeli troops just driving around in tanks with no one else around. What's the plan here?\"](https://twitter.com/Seamus_Malek/status/1720863083940487520)\n\nFar as I can tell, no need for a content warning besides general \"this is footage of a war\", I can't see any specific gore or blood or whatever.

Impossible to say whether an attack is successful for many of these, the Namer attack for example the obvious question is \"wheres the footage of the aftermath\". In cases like the Caterpillar you can clearly see an effect, in that its been abandoned and therefore someone can climb up on it to put a flag on, but for a lot of these you don't have any clear sign of the actual effect.\n\n[The actual footage, which includes the Namer attack in the linked tweet above.](https://twitter.com/ME_1948_Updates/status/1720858073911443876?s=20) Notable is what I *think* may be the use of a rifle grenade at one point, and a *very* close range attack on a Namer. Also an abandoned Caterpillar that gets used as a flagpost. Furthermore, the *environment* is particularly incredible, really getting across the destroyed urban environment. Fighters rushing between positions, using fences as concealment, popping out to fire a RPG down a tenfoot, etc etc.\n\nI post this stuff in spite of the caveats because I think its interesting.

They cited conflict in the Middle East and Europe and threats in Asia.\n\n>Sullivan called the blockade \u201ca national security suicide mission,\u201d and said the Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin were loving it.\n\n>\u201cHow dumb can we be?\u201d he asked, pointing out that hundreds of officers are caught in limbo instead of doing the jobs they were trained and promoted for, commanding the American armed forces. \n\n>Many of the nominated generals and admirals whose Senate confirmations have been stymied, Sullivan warned, will soon choose to quit and join the private sector, where they can make more money.\n\n>US Marine Corps Commandant Eric Smith was hospitalized after an apparent heart attack last Sunday, highlighting stress on senior officers as he led the service branch without a confirmed assistant commandant.\n\n\n>Senate Republicans plan to hold a special meeting to discuss the issue this coming week. Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television\u2019s \u201cBalance of Power\u201d that the two GOP senators\u2019 comments are \u201ca good sign that maybe we\u2019re heading in the right direction\u201d to end the blockade. \n\n>Still, most Republicans want to avoid voting on a resolution to bypass Tuberville, which Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he plans to bring to the Senate floor. That resolution, which would bundle the nominations to shorten the time for processing them, would require 60 votes, but set a precedent eroding the power of every individual senator to gum up the works to get the attention of the administration.\n\n>\u201cVote what you think your constituents would want you to vote,\u201d said Tuberville, who argues that he is representing voters who oppose abortion, also a priority for many party activists who play a critical role in Republican primaries.\n\n>Tuberville objects to US military travel and leave policies adopted after the Supreme Court overturned the Roe v. Wade constitutional right to an abortion. The policies allow service members and their families to go to states where the procedure is legal.\n\n\n>There\u2019s a parallel fight over funding Ukraine, with Republican leader Mitch McConnell joining the party\u2019s hawks to urge the Senate daily to back more Ukraine aid as part of a broad national security emergency package.

He also pried apart Biden\u2019s emergency national security funding request so that the House last week could separately handle Israel aid, which is more popular with the Republican populist wing.\n\n>But Johnson assured Senate Republicans in a private meeting this week that he considered Ukraine assistance a priority, lawmakers said.\n\n>The new speaker told reporters Thursday that the House would move to funding Ukraine next, though with provisions tying it to Republican demands on border security.\n\n>McConnell has also said the key to unlocking a broad national security package including Ukraine is getting a strong border package.

If you pay any attention to the various combat footage subreddits, or have a list on Twitter devoted to the subject, you'll have seen the massive fields of craters that the Soviet-style bombardments produce. \n\nSoviet style fires are effective when employed en masse, but they are tremendously challenging from a logistics perspective. Soviet fires are not designed for a long, grinding attritional war, because they not only burn through artillery shells at a massive rate, but they also burn through barrels.

            "body": "One of Andrew Perpetua's favorite refrains is (paraphrasing) \"The biggest misconception is that offense requires more resources than defense. It's actually the other way around.\"\n\nJust yesterday on his livestream, he said that conditions were unfavorable for Ukraine in this offensive because Russia has more men and more artillery. Russia's goal is to keep launching probing attacks until they attrit Ukrainian artillery stocks to the point where Ukraine is no longer able to effectively defend. And the situation is made worse by the fact that Ukraine burned through a lot of shells during its offensive.\n\nBut, if we combine the two points together, then Ukraine would have been in an even worse place today if they spent the whole year on the defensive, right? Because it takes more resources to defend than to attack?\n\nHe seems to be flip-flopping back and forth on this. Both points can make sense in isolation, but they cannot both be true at the same time.\n\nEDIT: I'm going to walk a lot of what I said because I rewatched some of the livestream from yesterday, and I think that Andrew Perpetua's point is that defense puts a higher strain on your supply lines.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>One of Andrew Perpetua&#39;s favorite refrains is (paraphrasing) &quot;The biggest misconception is that offense requires more resources than defense. It&#39;s actually the other way around.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Just yesterday on his livestream, he said that conditions were unfavorable for Ukraine in this offensive because Russia has more men and more artillery. Russia&#39;s goal is to keep launching probing attacks until they attrit Ukrainian artillery stocks to the point where Ukraine is no longer able to effectively defend. And the situation is made worse by the fact that Ukraine burned through a lot of shells during its offensive.</p>\n\n<p>But, if we combine the two points together, then Ukraine would have been in an even worse place today if they spent the whole year on the defensive, right? Because it takes more resources to defend than to attack?</p>\n\n<p>He seems to be flip-flopping back and forth on this. Both points can make sense in isolation, but they cannot both be true at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I&#39;m going to walk a lot of what I said because I rewatched some of the livestream from yesterday, and I think that Andrew Perpetua&#39;s point is that defense puts a higher strain on your supply lines. The defender (unlike the attacker) doesn&#39;t know ahead of time which point(s) on the front will need supplies, which means that they need to be able to supply any point at any time. This does not necessarily mean that they will burn through their resources at a higher clip than the attacker.</p>\n</div>",

He commented this in an AMA on this sub, but I feel as if it deserves to also be discussed in the daily thread(where there is more engagement). Here is a link to the original AMA: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/17nh832/comment/k7rxov8/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/17nh832/comment/k7rxov8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nQuestion:\n\n>There have been voices raising concern about ukrainian manpower issues. According to them there are very few volounteers and compelled conscription has to be relied upon more and more. The average age of an ukrainian soldier right now is said to hover around 43 years old.How does it look like from the local perspective? Do you observe any discontent because of draft? Are there any signs that the recruitment pool is becoming spent?\n\nAnswer:\n\n>There is a lot of tension around this issue.  \n>  \n>The high casualties Ukraine has incurred have forced them to conscript many people who do not want to fight. I know someone who is so scared of being conscripted, that he avoids going outside, and when he does, he carries a can of pepper spray in case draft officers attempt to force him to the local conscription office. There are telegram channels in many Ukrainian cities, that collectively monitor the movement and activity of draft officers, to help warn people when they are handing out draft papers in places like metro stations and supermarkets.  \n>  \n>The people who tend to be conscripted are generally very poor, and hold a great amount of resentment towards draft officers and the upper class, as there have been many reports of wealthy people bribing these officers with substantial amounts of money for fake medical forms that exempt them from the draft.\n\nAside from the obvious issue of declining morale, this indicates anything but Ukraine having healthy conscription numbers in the future. In fact, it indicates serious problems with both the quantity and quality of Ukraine's actual conscription pool. It seems to me that barring a significant territorial victory at the front, the amount of people Ukraine successfully conscripts per unit time will only decrease, and the morale/quality of those draftees will also only decrease.\n\nThis becomes less an issue of how many bodies does Ukraine have to conscript from(see my comment [https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/17mtfsi/comment/k7ra5w5/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/17mtfsi/comment/k7ra5w5/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for what this number realistically looks like for Ukraine), and more of an issue of even if Ukraine had this many bodies to conscript from, what percentage of people can they actually conscript without causing significant domestic unrest. If the war goes on in its current form, I see this percentage only dropping.\n\nThe reasons for this are obvious, as we can ask questions like: What are the effects if Ukraine runs out of poor people to conscript and starts to crack down on wealthy draft dodgers? What are the effects if Ukraine starts to conscript 50+ year olds and 20-25 year olds if they start running out of middle aged men?

The problem in Gaza has existed already and has been exacerbated by Israel's withdrawal. Had Israel not eradicated the threat in the WB, the massacre of 07/10 would have been much larger. Not smaller.\n\nLebanon is already as much challenging as Iran can make it, removing Gaza as a threat will make Israel's position stronger, as Hezbollah will have less pretext to engage, and a two front war will become impossible. \n\nIran, Hezbollah and the entire anti Israel axis is desperate for a cease fire that will save Hamas.

The problem in Gaza has existed already and has been exacerbated by Israel&#39;s withdrawal. Had Israel not eradicated the threat in the WB, the massacre of 07/10 would have been much larger.

She already beat back an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/01/us/politics/house-republicans-democrats-expulsion-censure.html\">attempt to censure her</a> in the House this week over her comments on the war and is facing <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/02/us/politics/rashida-tlaib-israel-ads.html\">attack ads from a Democratic pro-Israel group.</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It&#39;s just one voice, but of note is the tenacity with which it persists.</p>\n\n<p>What&#39;s the future of &#39;alternative&#39; worldviews in the Democratic party, given that some Muslim minorities have apparently been vocal enough that major news outlets have picked up their promises to not vote for Biden in 2024?</p>\n\n<p>I personally find pandering to blocks that apparently can quickly unify with &#39;extreme&#39; stances on issues, and somewhat possibly, threaten the reelection, to be a bit risky.

You can see that although some material has been removed, it's not a lot (APFSDS darts are only ~30mm across and the pole is hollow) and the projectile appears to have remained intact, albeit probably on a less stable trajectory.

Instead of submitting Khorenko's application for dismissal to Zaluzhny, it seems Zelensky went behind their backs and dismissed Khorenko without both of them knowing. I don't know what the standard process of dismissal in Ukraine is, but the commander of the SSO finding out he's been fired through one of Zelensky's video addresses/mass media definitely seems to be nonstandard.\n\nThe question is if Zelensky believes Khorenko is doing a poor job and dismissed him because of that or for other reasons. The fact that Khorenko had Zaluzhny's full approval makes me think his dismissal is more politically motivated than anything else.

This also seems to represent a widening of the chasm between Zelensky and Zaluzhny, as Zelensky is obviously not happy about Zaluzhny's interview completely undermining his office's messaging(see comment below), In short, this could be Zelensky's attempt to curtail Zaluzhny's growing influence(see TIME article) by replacing leadership that Zaluzhny approves of with people that share Zelensky's views on the war.\n\nThis is more evidence of growing domestic/political unrest behind the scenes in Ukraine. Last year, this wasn't an issue as Ukraine had pulled off terrific victories at Kharkiv and Kherson. The idea that Ukraine just needed to pull a Kharkiv one more time around Zaporozhia to liberate Crimea was the entire selling point behind the counteroffensive. After having gone on an extremely bloody counteroffensive for no significant progress and now facing a renewed Russian offensive, glimpses of Ukrainian political unrest are increasingly falling through the cracks or being exposed entirely(Zaluzhny's economist interview is an example of the band-aid being ripped off).",

Biden administration officials also are worried that Ukraine is running out of forces, while Russia has a seemingly endless supply, officials said. Ukraine is also struggling with recruiting and has recently seen public protests about some of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s open-ended conscription requirements.\n* Some U.S. military officials have privately begun using the term \u201cstalemate\u201d to describe the current battle in Ukraine, with some saying it may come down to which side can maintain a military force the longest.\n* President Joe Biden has been intensely focused on Ukraine\u2019s depleting military forces, according to two people familiar with the matter. \r\r  \n\"Manpower is at the top of the administration\u2019s concerns right now,\u201d one said.

That\u2019s a significant change from just three months ago when 24% of Americans said they felt that way. The poll also found that 33% of Americans think the U.S. is doing the right amount for Ukraine, while 25% said the U.S. is not doing enough. \n\nWith the failure of Ukraine's counter-offensive to break Russia's land bridge, the messaging is pivoting into ending the costly war. The word that is starting to float now is \"stalemate\". I believe that we will hear and read more and more along this line of topic in the next few weeks. This is how PR messaging works. Unknown officials will release some info in the press and see what kind of reactions it will induce. If it has a positive acceptance, then they move on to semi-official press releases and so on.

The poll also found that 33% of Americans think the U.S. is doing the right amount for Ukraine, while 25% said the U.S. is not doing enough. </p>\n\n<p>With the failure of Ukraine&#39;s counter-offensive to break Russia&#39;s land bridge, the messaging is pivoting into ending the costly war. The word that is starting to float now is &quot;stalemate&quot;. I believe that we will hear and read more and more along this line of topic in the next few weeks. This is how PR messaging works. Unknown officials will release some info in the press and see what kind of reactions it will induce. If it has a positive acceptance, then they move on to semi-official press releases and so on. If it faces a negative response, then they kill the messaging and move on to the next plan.</p>\n</div>",

I mean, seriously, \"If Russia attacked the Baltics and Poland, Poland would be extremely happy\", that's an actual quote from one of the comments.\n\nAnyway, first of all, we have to define what \"opening a second front\" means. A full scale invasion on an EU country seems completely out of question. Russian army is currently bogged-down in Ukraine and they can't use the troops that are needed there.\n\nIt would be technically possible for Russia to mount some kind of limited, hybrid-war style incursion into, say, the Baltics. But the main question is: what would it accomplish? Right now, NATO is united, and there's little doubt that the Allies would have intervened and helped repel the incursion.\n\nIn this scenario, Russian aggression would be perceived as yet another confirmation that it is a threat, and it would give the West incentive to increase the aid for Ukraine. This isn't a good outcome for Russia.\n\nThe real worry is about the future. NATO works as a deterrent only if it's credible, just existing on paper is not enough. If you want an example, look at Armenia. Armenia is a member of CSTO, which is a military alliance that includes Russia. There's no doubt that Russia is a much stronger country than Azerbaijan. But despite their official commitments, they don't seem too interested in defending Armenia. And because of that, the alliance doesn't work as a deterrent against Azerbaijan.\n\nIt's possible that in the future the credibility of NATO would be undermined, e.g. by isolationist leaders. If there's a strong doubt whether the West is interested in defending the eastern flank, then there's an incentive for Russia to try *something*. \n\nI would also note that politicians are generally wary of escalation. Conflicts between great powers tend to be confined to a limited theater. The Korean War didn't escalate into WW3 even though it involved troops from China and the USSR on one side, and NATO on the other. The Sino-Soviet border conflict didn't escalate into a full-scale war. India and Pakistan didn't nuke each other. Hell, even this conflict is an example of that.
