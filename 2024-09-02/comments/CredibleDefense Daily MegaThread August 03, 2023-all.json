In Soviet times, the then Siberian Military District (the main ancestor of today's CMD) was among the weakest in peacetime and was tasked with creating wartime reserves.

In all, according to the Russians, the aim is to create 5 divisions and 26 brigades in the armed forces (I'm pretty sure this figure includes non-maneuver brigades, like Air Force's brigades). That seems a bit of a downward plan compared to the plans of the winter when they said they wanted to create 3 motorized divisions, 2 VDV divisions, 5 artillery divisions as well as forming 7 motorized divisions from as many existing motorized brigades and expanding their 5 naval infantry brigades into as many divisions.

Now it's the first time Russia is beginning to create complex formations such as combined arms armies (which need lots of senior officers), with the exception of the 3rd Corps formed by volunteers last summer, which despite good equipment has always performed very poorly in every sector. \n\nThese new formations as far as I read are supposed to come into action by next year, so no extremely rushed thing. Although personally I am skeptical about the chances of getting enough personnel in first place, when the current monthly enlistment flow - sizeable, but limited in relation to Russian needs - is mainly used to replenish existing units. I definitely see the need for a second major wave of mobilization. On equipment, too, there is a lot to wonder about. In theory, hundreds and hundreds of tanks and IFVs would be needed for all these new formations. It will be an opportunity to see how true or not the Russian reports about multiplied production/refurbishment capacities during 2023 are. Another issue will be providing enough shells (proportioned to the needs from their way of doing war) to organic artillery units of the new formations.\n\nIn recent months the Russian MoD seems to have been giving away T-80BVs from the storage to whatever units needed them and from whatever military district - until then such tank was used by formations from the EMD or the Arctic Fleet and by the 4th GTD.

        "body": "A [new episode of War on the Rocks](https://warontherocks.com/2023/08/zooming-out-on-ukraines-offensive/) featuring Michael Kofman dropped today. \n\nKey takeaways:\n\n* Kofman reiterated his previous position that the Ukrainian decision to fight for Bakhmut was a strategic failure: -> he claims that the overall casualty ratio for the battle was 3-to-1 or perhaps even as high as 4-to-1 in Ukraine's favor, but they traded the lives of their professional units largely in exchange for Wagner convicts. He further argues that if Ukraine had pulled back earlier, Wagner would've had no luck advancing further into the heights around Chashiv Yar and they would've been stuck holding the poor terrain of Bakhmut. On top of that, the highly skilled, well experienced Ukrainian units that were stuck defending Bakhmut weren't able to rest and refit in time for the Ukrainian offensive where they likely would've been highly effective (veteran Ukrainian units have made most of the advances as part of ongoing offensive). Beyond all of that, the decision to hold Bakhmut meant that Russia seized the initiative from Ukraine, and allowed the majority of the Russian army (who weren't involved in the fighting at Bakhmut) to deeply entrench in the South at the level of the Combined Arms Army. \n\n* Kofman also heavily criticized the decision to equip brand new units with Western kit. These units were made up of mostly mobilized personnel with no prior military service, and led by a hodgepodge of commanders pulled from other units. They were given a rushed training regimen on Western-style combined arms, but without enough time to learn how to operate cohesive and without the airpower that this doctrine relies on. Worse than that, these units were then sent to attack the most heavily fortified Russian positions in the entire theater as their first operations as a unit, with no knowledge of the terrain. The whole scheme was flawed from the get go, and the performance of these units has been pretty abysmal as a result. \n\n* He seemingly implies that Western decisionmakers had a key role in shaping this offensive in a way that was likely to prove ineffective. 3 months of training in Western style training was insufficient to teach these units how to conduct a Western style advance, especially without the enablers the West enjoys like air superiority. Instead Western policymakers should have met the Ukrainian military where they are, supporting them in how they already know how to fight by ramping up Western military industrial capacity in order to properly supply the Ukrainian method of fighting. \n\n* Kofman thinks it would've made much more sense to pull some of their veteran units off the line and retrain them on Western kit, arguing that their experience would mesh well with the new capabilities of the Western gear. Beyond that, instead of forming brand new units, Ukraine should have just continued its practice of building up existing formations by adding new battalions as they would be integrated into command structures and logistical arrangements that were already experienced and effective. \n\n* **Kofman seemingly suggests that *political* decisionmakers are influencing military strategy** such as the decision to hold Bakhmut despite unfavorable conditions.* Exact quote: \"What makes anyone assume that some of the core decisions being made are being driven by military strategy born of the general staff versus political leadership...\" \n\n* Suggests that the counteroffensive actually started in mid-May, but only in earnest in early June. \n\n* The Ukrainian offensive involves three separate lines of advances, the main effort is pushing South from Orikhiv down to Melitopol, a supportimg axis pushing south from Velkya Novosilka down to Berdiansk, and a fixing action around Bakhmut. The Bakhmut effort involves some of Ukraine's most experienced units and has proven most successful, but is strategically irrelevant. Behind the existing Russian lines, they have defensive fortifications they can fall back to. \n\n* Ukraine's offensive in the South and around Bakhmut left them weak around Svatove-Kreminna, which Russia exploited. A new Western Brigade there proved weak on the defense and was forced to retreat repeatedly, requiring the repositioning of other units to plug the gaps. \n\n* A fair criticism of the offensive is that it was too broadly focused, which didn't allow Ukraine to obtain true artillery dominance on a single axis of advance, instead enjoying just modest advantages on several. This diffusion of effort is exactly the same problem that Kofman criticized Russia for in their Winter Offensive. \n\n* Over the past 5 days there's been a renewed Ukrainian effort to push South of Orikhiv with much of the fighting around Robotyne. \n\n* He believes the original plan was for IX Corps to break through the Russian front lines in the South and reached or possibly even breached the Russian main defensive line. X Corps was then supposed to follow up this advance and breakthrough the Russian main line, and then the reserves would've been introduced to develop momentum and push potentially all the way to the coast. This obviously didn't happen. \n\n* Instead, the IX Corps struggled to make headway and the X Corps has been introduced in an attempt to reach the main Russian line of defense. The Ukrainian hope is that Russia will run out of reserves to plug holes in their defense, and while Kofman has seen some evidence of Russia utilizing some of its reserves already, the fighting of the last 4-5 days doesn't look much different from that of the past 7 weeks. They've only made modest gains, attaining limited ground around Robotyne. The newer brigades of X Corps haven't done well, similar to the other new Western brigades. \n\n* He thinks the Russian forces have been on the wrong end of the attritional curve during the offensive, but have an easier task defending. Ukraine has been winning the artillery battle and counterbattery battle, especially as a result of the use of HIMARS at the tactical level. Storm Shadows used for deep strikes to target Russian command and control doesn't seem to have much of an impact on Russia's ability to defend. The Russian side is clearly being worn down, as a result of the fighting, but the fighting is now a slog. \n\n* The main question of the offensive is will Ukraine be able to deplete Russian front line units enough to enable a breakthrough, without depleting their own forces too much in the process. He's unsure Ukraine will be able to make enough progress to achieve any of its strategic objectives with this offensive, and he's become more pessimistic having seen the results of the last two months. \n\nPersonal note: Kofman sounds exasperated and frustrated during this podcast. He explicitly says he's more pessimistic about Ukrainian chances after seeing how things have played out over the past two months. Hard to blame him either, this offensive really hasn't lived up to the hype at all and may very well be Ukraine's last, best hope of achieving some of its key objectives in the war. We may have already seem the high water mark of Western support, and it was squandered in no small part due to Western influence on Ukrainian strategy, but also potentially by political decisions made by the Zelensky government.",

If urban terrain is damaged/destroyed, politically they get more support globally and Russian gets more blame, and militarily they benefit from defending urban terrain, which is a force multiplier.</p>\n</div>",

The US has more, but its clearly reluctant to send Abrams tanks with DU armor (it doesn't have many \"export\" versions of the Abrams available despite hundreds of older models sitting in storage) and the US doesn't want to feel like Europe isn't taking the lead in a conflict in their backyard. \n\n> West can't even last a year and a half to prevent a defeat in Europe and will tuck tail after the first setback?\n\nThat's not what I said or what Kofman believes.

But I think that for a country like China, which is pursuing a technology decoupling from the West (partially helped by the U.S.), that's a cost they may be willing to bear. Not absolutely, and it would hurt, yes. But between COVID, U.S. decoupling from China, and now the war, China is looking to become self sufficient, and they're doing a fairly decent job at it. Plus, Taiwan lacks the strategic depth that Ukraine has, meaning the risk of a high manpower cost from a long war is lower (though not impossible - I will concede that even places with little strategic depth have become grinding killzones).",

But I think that for a country like China, which is pursuing a technology decoupling from the West (partially helped by the U.S.), that&#39;s a cost they may be willing to bear. Not absolutely, and it would hurt, yes. But between COVID, U.S. decoupling from China, and now the war, China is looking to become self sufficient, and they&#39;re doing a fairly decent job at it. Plus, Taiwan lacks the strategic depth that Ukraine has, meaning the risk of a high manpower cost from a long war is lower (though not impossible - I will concede that even places with little strategic depth have become grinding killzones).</p>\n</div>",

It\u2019s Western weaponry that blunted the initial invasion, it\u2019s western weaponry that\u2019s helped equalise the massive artillery differential. \n\nFor sure, there are issues with logistics and production and European armies can\u2019t keep up with high intensity war without US support.\n\nBut what army can? Russia can\u2019t. It would be highly surprising if Turkey or Iran could do better. Unless European nations start fighting each other, China seems like the only possible threat that could.

Instead Western policymakers should have met the Ukrainian military where they are, supporting them in how they already know how to fight by ramping up Western military industrial capacity in order to properly supply the Ukrainian method of fighting.\n\nJack Watling implied the same. I wonder what their proof is because this doesn't even make sense. \n\nIn terms of how the Ukrainians fight, again, look at Kharkiv in May. Look at Kherson in June. Look at Kherson in September. Look at Kharkiv in September. This is how they fight, offensively. \n\nAgain, the Ukrainians did this EXACT same thing last year in Kherson, they sent unprepared units on the offensive to conduct combined arms breaching operations, thinking they were going to breakthrough quickly and didn't. We definitely weren't the cause last time, why would we be the cause this time? \n\nIn terms of alternatives, the Ukrainians are never going to have had the ammo resupply to win through fires and incremental advances. That runs counter to Western supporters who don't want to wait a decade. It can't be supplied in 2023 and potentially not in 2024 (developing ammo production increases aren't expected to start peaking until another year).

That runs totally counter to all major NATO militaries and how they think. \n\nMore so, [there is evidence](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-officials-advise-ukraine-wait-offensive-official-says-2023-01-20/) that the Ukrainians were already planning something bigger and sooner and it was NATO who had to get them to throttle back to be better prepared.  \n\nThe only thing we were responsible for was for running the mediocre at best combined arms training that didn't start until late January.

And NATO shouldn't be the ones held responsible for not setting up training outside of Ukraine when the Ukrainians wont even set up that training inside Ukraine. And I'm not talking about battalion and above maneuver centric mechanized training. Why can't the Ukrainians even provide staff training for their officers? Why didn't they create what was needed to provide initial training? Because its not a priority for them, its something they can pawn off on the West.  \n\nThe closest I could find of evidence to back up Kofman's and Watling's claim, that NATO was responsible for pushing this offensive to be done as it was, was [this CNN article](https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/24/politics/ukraine-shift-tactics-bakhmut/index.html). However, the focus on it was to stop fighting in Bakhmut and prepare for a summer offensive that they were already planning (see Reuters article). The whole point of the early January unlocking of western military equipment, especially AFV, and standing up combined arms training, was to make the summer offensive more successful. It wasn't actually some nefarious plot, it was trying to get the Ukrainians to focus on the very offensive they were already talking up since 2022, a major spring-summer strategic offensive to get back to the Feb 23, 2022 lines, which is even what Zaluzhny was [talking about in December '22](https://www.economist.com/zaluzhny-transcript). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Kofman seemingly suggests that political decisionmakers are influencing military strategy such as the decision to hold Bakhmut despite unfavorable conditions.\\* Exact quote: \"What makes anyone assume that some of the core decisions being made are being driven by military strategy born of the general staff versus political leadership...\"\n\nIt was definitely a strategic level decision made in Kyiv, because they pulled strategic reserves to reinforce and had to make other decisions of national importance. So the decision was either Zelensky's pressed on the military, or the military's that was pressed on Zelensky's. \n\nThere is no **valid** military reason to hold Bakhmut besides attrition, and that was bunk, Zaluzhny would have to be a total idiot to not realize that the attrition rate favored the side using disposable troops. \n\nOtherwise, are we to believe the top military leadership of the UAF are no longer focusing on military operational and strategic thinking but are giving military advise to the President of Ukraine focusing on national politics? \n\nOr maybe politicians are making political decisions. \n\n*Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth.*\n\nZelensky made the call.",
            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>He seemingly implies that Western decisionmakers had a key role in shaping this offensive in a way that was likely to prove ineffective. 3 months of training in Western style training was insufficient to teach these units how to conduct a Western style advance, especially without the enablers the West enjoys like air superiority. Instead Western policymakers should have met the Ukrainian military where they are, supporting them in how they already know how to fight by ramping up Western military industrial capacity in order to properly supply the Ukrainian method of fighting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Jack Watling implied the same. I wonder what their proof is because this doesn&#39;t even make sense. </p>\n\n<p>In terms of how the Ukrainians fight, again, look at Kharkiv in May. Look at Kherson in June. Look at Kherson in September. Look at Kharkiv in September. This is how they fight, offensively. </p>\n\n<p>Again, the Ukrainians did this EXACT same thing last year in Kherson, they sent unprepared units on the offensive to conduct combined arms breaching operations, thinking they were going to breakthrough quickly and didn&#39;t. We definitely weren&#39;t the cause last time, why would we be the cause this time? </p>\n\n<p>In terms of alternatives, the Ukrainians are never going to have had the ammo resupply to win through fires and incremental advances.

Its now confirmed that these new brigades organized a battalion around 'on hand' BMPs and are rotating a portion of forces through to 'see the elephant', while the majority of the brigade receives more modern equipment and training. For example, the 44th is mostly in Poland training on their brand new KTO Rosomaks and some Finnish APCs: Their tank battalion will be Leo 1s and their artillery will be (primarily/initially) refurbished (by Poland) 152mm SPGs. \n\nI have seen no new brigades announced since the 141, 143 and 144 RRB now in training, as the UAF appear to have shifted new unit formation to independent infantry battalions, of which there are currently well over 40 on line or in training. There could be a number of reasons for this shift, some good, some not so good. It could be that with an active offensive under way, the UAF hasn't the personnel/materials/ leadership to be forming new brigades at the moment; As likely, the pace of forming armor, artillery, and recon battalions or engineering/medical/logistics groups can't keep pace with the new infantry battalions, so Ukraine is producing the less integrated units. Third, it may be a side effect of the practice of forming brigades from pre-trained units, rather than green troops. Finally, it may be a simple realization that the existing veteran brigades can provide C3 for more than the initial 3+1 battalions- most of the pre war brigades have a 4th infantry battalion attached, and some have a fifth- The result has been significantly greater staying power and reliability for the existing brigades. And some points in the line don't need a whole brigade.  Probably a combination of them all. \n\nI was puzzled that so many Territorial Brigades are off the line. I was expecting to see several rotate into the Luhansk/Kremina line but they got green OMBs there instead. Apparently, many veteran TDBs haven't been available because they are in extended training and gearing up. more than a few are mounting battalions or whole brigades, and together with significantly more grenade launchers, HMGs and mortars, are transitioning into larger versions of the old Motorized divisions (which have transitioned into small mech brigades). Mostly we are talking truck transport, but all the units are getting some level of 'protected' cover (not true mech, but MRAPS , IMVs and armored hummers,). Currently inconvenient, but quite beneficial in the long run.\n\n155mm Artillery keeps trickling in with more M777s and M-109L, and  active delivery contracts for Krabs, Zusanas, ect, but I don't see a pathway for more medium guns. I think the allies have gone about as far as they can with towed  105mms, and the supply of 2S1s parked for lack of ammo have pretty much cycled back in. Some more French AMX 10 RCs may come in, and perhaps we may finally see the Stryker AGSs shipped over (probably not), but are they planning on making due with self propelled 120mm howitzers?\n\nFinal note I even the International Legion is gearing up, as they just deployed their 1st Mechanized Battalion to the line. Dettails to follow.\n I've got a whole rank about ammo supplies , but I'll save that for a different post.\n\nEdit: I still have no idea where the 13th Jager has gotten off to, or what they are armed with. The last reliable info is from May, when they were training in Norway.  I'm starting to think of them as the IXth Roman Legion.",

It's a command approach that decentralizes decision making, giving subordinates a mission and then offering them support you control to pull it off. Whereas Directive Command involves the higher commanders doing the planning and then telling subordinate that their piece is.\n\nSo say the 150th Mech Brigade of the UAF is tasked with securing a breakthrough in three different towns, the brigade tasks one of them, the 101st Mechanized Infantry Battalion, to attack Examplivol. \n\nIf the commander uses Mission Command he'll give a very basic order that includes the overall commander's intent, mission objective, and timelines.\n\n\"Operating as part of the larger offensive against the Tokmak axis, the 150th is launching three simultaneous attacks against three villages to secure a breakthrough. The 101st Bn will attack Examplivol no earlier than 0200 on June 6, no later than 0600.\"\n\nThen the higher command gives additional coordination instructions and info. Like the 101st will have access to a full battalion of artillery, electronic warfare support, ADA, etc.\n\nThen it's on the 101st commander to figure out how to do it and even back brief the 150th Brigade commander on his plan, get it approved. At which point the artillery battalion gets told they'll be directly supporting the 101st and will take all fire commands for them.\n\nHowever, the problem with this is it requires a legit culture that supports delegating authority, trusting subordinates, accepting if they make mistakes. It requires a system where the subordinates are very well trained to the same degree as the senior command and staff, because they need to agree on doctrine and how to execute orders: the commander delegates to the subordinate because the subordinate would basically make the same good decision the higher level commander would. It requires subordinate units to have not only knowledgeable commanders, but also the staff who can do complex combined arms planning.\n\nUnfortunately, the Ukrainians aren't really there. The culture for Mission Command isn't as strong as propaganda suggests. Training isn't standardized and skill isn't equal. And battalion level staff is pretty lacking in size and skill. So they tend to favor centralized Directives Command.\n\nWhich would be the 150th Bde (or potentially an even higher level command echelon) doing all the planning for the attack on Examplivol, then telling 101st Battalion they will attack at 0525 on a route provided to them, being supported by fires the brigade coordinates with their artillery that goes from 0500-0523. But because the brigade command and staff can't coordinate anything more complex, they end up only supporting one attack at a time. When 101st is done at Examplivol, the 94th Bn attacks Othertiv. And when they're done, the 53rd Bn attacks Badplanol. But because the 101st Bn attack fails, they end up cancelling or delaying the others because the brigade staff is focused on saving the 101st from a mass casualty event. But the 94th didn't get the word to delay, so they attack Othertiv anyway, but with no artillery support because that did get cancelled and redirected to help extract the 101st from a giant kill zone they're stuck in.\n\nBut then the 94th makes success, they struck a weak point without even knowing. Can they exploit it? No. The brigade is too busy still dealing with the 101st, so by the time the 94th can be reinforced the Russians are already counterattacking too, driving the 94th back.\n\nAnd so it goes...",

With Ukraine seeming to make this choice when armored column thrusts didn't work out in June, I personally predict that serious territorial gains for Ukraine will only happen if Russian resistance collapse or Ukraine runs out of artillery munitions (saw an interview here a while back of I think a Ukrainian artillery commander, who said \"phase 1\" of the offensive could be extended due to the delivery of cluster munitions).",

        "body": "[Two U.S. Navy Sailors Charged With Helping Chinese](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/03/us/politics/navy-sailors-spy-china.html?smid=nytcore-android-share)\n\nTwo Navy sailors in Southern California were arrested and accused of providing military secrets and sensitive information to Chinese intelligence officers, according to a pair of federal indictments unsealed on Thursday.\n\nJinchao Wei, known as Patrick Wei, 22, was charged with spying for the Chinese under the Espionage Act. Mr. Wei serves aboard the Essex, an amphibious assault ship moored at Naval Base San Diego, which is the home of the Pacific Fleet. As a machinist\u2019s mate, investigators said, he had clearance that gave him access to sensitive national security information.\n\nThe second sailor, Petty Officer Wenheng Zhao, 26, also known as Thomas, was charged with taking bribes in exchange for providing sensitive U.S. military information to a Chinese intelligence officer posing as an economic researcher. Mr. Zhao worked at the Naval Base Ventura County in Port Hueneme, which is home to several aircraft squadrons and the service\u2019s naval construction battalions in the Pacific.\n\nThe charges appear to reflect the Chinese government\u2019s deep interest in the Navy\u2019s Pacific Fleet and other aspects of the American military\u2019s operations in that region, part of a broader effort by China to steal American corporate and national security secrets. Already, the extent of Chinese spying, including cyberbreaches, has prompted top national security officials to sound the alarm. In testimony before Congress this year, the F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray warned, \u201cThere\u2019s no country that presents a more significant threat to our innovation, our ideas our economic security, our national security than the Chinese government.\u201d\n\nIn a news conference in San Diego on Thursday, Randy S.

Mr. Wei serves aboard the Essex, an amphibious assault ship moored at Naval Base San Diego, which is the home of the Pacific Fleet. As a machinist\u2019s mate, investigators said, he had clearance that gave him access to sensitive national security information.</p>\n\n<p>The second sailor, Petty Officer Wenheng Zhao, 26, also known as Thomas, was charged with taking bribes in exchange for providing sensitive U.S. military information to a Chinese intelligence officer posing as an economic researcher. Mr. Zhao worked at the Naval Base Ventura County in Port Hueneme, which is home to several aircraft squadrons and the service\u2019s naval construction battalions in the Pacific.</p>\n\n<p>The charges appear to reflect the Chinese government\u2019s deep interest in the Navy\u2019s Pacific Fleet and other aspects of the American military\u2019s operations in that region, part of a broader effort by China to steal American corporate and national security secrets. Already, the extent of Chinese spying, including cyberbreaches, has prompted top national security officials to sound the alarm. In testimony before Congress this year, the F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray warned, \u201cThere\u2019s no country that presents a more significant threat to our innovation, our ideas our economic security, our national security than the Chinese government.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In a news conference in San Diego on Thursday, Randy S. Grossman, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of California, said that Mr. Wei, 22, a naturalized citizen, chose to \u201cbetray his newly adopted country,\u201d rather than report inappropriate contact from a Chinese intelligence officer.</p>\n\n<p>Mr. Grossman said the section of the Espionage Act under which Mr. Wei was charged has been used just a handful of times in the past few years, underscoring the seriousness of the crime.

Pouring weapons into Ukraine so that the people who want to defend their democracy have the means to do so is working great, and has already resulted in a defeat for authoritarianism, with the only remaining question the scale of the defeat. Any society under assault from some authoritarian should know that the same offer is open to them if they&#39;re interested in defending themselves.</p>\n\n<p>We should also be focused on increasing living standards in democracies so that it&#39;s dramatically more desirable to live there than under some dictator. We aren&#39;t going bring democracy to Russia with an invasion. There&#39;s a pattern here. We had democracy in Western Europe, and it was great. So great that Eastern Europe decided it wanted some, and the USSR fell apart. 20ish years later, the people in Ukraine saw that life looked better for their neighbors in the West, which brings us to today. If we do this right then 20 years from now everyone living in Belgorod will wonder why they can&#39;t have a high standard of living like their neighbors in Kharkiv, and democracy will keep moving East. Military power isn&#39;t the only or the best way to beat these people.</p>\n</div>",

            "body": "I somewhat agree with this, but I would hesitate on many of the other predictions here. Here's my reasons why it seems like its going to draw to a stalemate, but not so much a frozen conflict:\n\n- Russia has partially mobilized itself now. In the early stages of the war, taking back ground for Ukraine was a lot easier since Russia very evidently didn't expect that much resistance. Russian formations advanced in packed columns along major roadways to seize major cities, roads, and other important objectives. While this isn't bad, its clear their plan was similar to how they conducted themselves in Crimea. They expected to swiftly move in and force submission without that much of a fight. Its why a mile long convoy got stuck outside Kyiv for multiple days straight. Its why a large number of air assault units were left without support, because their support got held up by strong resistance. Russia had to majorly replan and reorganize after the initial days of the war, and was more vulnerable then. They're not as unprepared now though. The frontline in Zaporizhzhia is by far the most comprehensive and strongest defensive buildup Russia has had thus far. \n- The landscape of the battle is different. The Kherson & Kharkiv fronts were majorly over extended. Most importantly the entire Kherson front by the Russians was supplied by basically one single bridge across the Dnieper, which as we saw caused catastrophic supply issues forcing a retreat. It was an obvious weakpoint in the Russian defense. Same goes for the Kharkiv area. It was much less prepared, especially with the looming and then present Kherson counteroffensive, and the terrain around Kharkiv is ideal for maneuver warfare. But if you look at the landscape now, the Donetsk region is very hilly and forested, and has been built up and dug in for the past 8 years by DPR/LPR forces, making a counteroffensive difficult. The Dnieper River is basically an inpenetrable barrier for either side, the river is about as wide as a small lake with very little bridges, and neither side has great amphibious capabilities. Nothern Luhansk can be ideal for attack, but its of minimal strategic importance. The most ideal area to attack would be Zaporizhzhia, but its been heavily entrenched, and especially the land being coated with landmines makes offensives difficult. \n- Neither side has any real air power. Russian deliver air launched missiles from within their own airspace at standoff range. Ukrainian helicopters hug the ground and loft rocket barrages high into the sky than get close. Large portions of the Russian helicopter fleet have been outright destroyed, including an outright third of their Ka-50/52 fleet. And a large number of Ukrainian jets are basically in hibernation. Air power is a major part of modern combined arms offensives. Operation Desert Storm was one of the most successful ground campaigns in military history, but in large part that was due to the apocalyptic levels of air power the coalition had. \n- Ukraine is limited in manpower. Its a nation of 44 million, yes, but Russia has triple their population and seems very willing to mobilize more troops for it. Ukraine also has 6,000,000 of its people as refugees in other countries. Some of these are elderly and children yes, but a not-insignificant amount are combat capable men and women who can't be reached for service. It seems likely based on Ukraine's actions thus far that it wishes to conserve lives, and therefore is unlikely to partake in actions like Wagner did at Bakhmut, which while gaining land, results in an incredible amount of casualties. \n- Neither side seems willing to negotiate or give in. Ukrainian morale is incredibly high, in large part due to their sovereignty having already been violated by Russia for nearly a decade prior to the war. Ukrainians want to see their nation survive, and they probably want to end the war with security guarantees. After all, Crimea was already seized and that didn't stop Russia from invading in 2022, so they probably want assurances or membership to NATO to prevent a third violation of their borders. Russia is unlikely to give in either. They're basically caught holding the bag. They've suffered a serious loss in military, economic, and diplomatic capabilities due to this war, it would be disasterous to not come out with something. And, they've already formally said they annexed Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson. They seem committed to the battle. The absolute most I could see Ukraine giving up is some concession of autonomy or full territorial control to Russia of Luhansk & Donetsk, as well as giving up any ambitions to Crimea. But they don't seem to be even considering that as of yet. But, both sides are determined to continue the conflict. Ukraine saw how the Donbas war went, they probably don't want to let things stall again. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nStalemale? I think so. Frozen conflict? Not really, both sides want to continue fighting and you would be hard pressed to get them to talk. That being said, this \"stalemate\" is still going to see more action and a more dynamic front than we'd probably see in the Western Front of WW1.",

Russia had to majorly replan and reorganize after the initial days of the war, and was more vulnerable then. They&#39;re not as unprepared now though. The frontline in Zaporizhzhia is by far the most comprehensive and strongest defensive buildup Russia has had thus far. </li>\n<li>The landscape of the battle is different. The Kherson &amp; Kharkiv fronts were majorly over extended. Most importantly the entire Kherson front by the Russians was supplied by basically one single bridge across the Dnieper, which as we saw caused catastrophic supply issues forcing a retreat. It was an obvious weakpoint in the Russian defense. Same goes for the Kharkiv area. It was much less prepared, especially with the looming and then present Kherson counteroffensive, and the terrain around Kharkiv is ideal for maneuver warfare. But if you look at the landscape now, the Donetsk region is very hilly and forested, and has been built up and dug in for the past 8 years by DPR/LPR forces, making a counteroffensive difficult. The Dnieper River is basically an inpenetrable barrier for either side, the river is about as wide as a small lake with very little bridges, and neither side has great amphibious capabilities. Nothern Luhansk can be ideal for attack, but its of minimal strategic importance. The most ideal area to attack would be Zaporizhzhia, but its been heavily entrenched, and especially the land being coated with landmines makes offensives difficult. </li>\n<li>Neither side has any real air power. Russian deliver air launched missiles from within their own airspace at standoff range. Ukrainian helicopters hug the ground and loft rocket barrages high into the sky than get close. Large portions of the Russian helicopter fleet have been outright destroyed, including an outright third of their Ka-50/52 fleet. And a large number of Ukrainian jets are basically in hibernation. Air power is a major part of modern combined arms offensives. Operation Desert Storm was one of the most successful ground campaigns in military history, but in large part that was due to the apocalyptic levels of air power the coalition had. </li>\n<li>Ukraine is limited in manpower. Its a nation of 44 million, yes, but Russia has triple their population and seems very willing to mobilize more troops for it. Ukraine also has 6,000,000 of its people as refugees in other countries. Some of these are elderly and children yes, but a not-insignificant amount are combat capable men and women who can&#39;t be reached for service. It seems likely based on Ukraine&#39;s actions thus far that it wishes to conserve lives, and therefore is unlikely to partake in actions like Wagner did at Bakhmut, which while gaining land, results in an incredible amount of casualties. </li>\n<li>Neither side seems willing to negotiate or give in. Ukrainian morale is incredibly high, in large part due to their sovereignty having already been violated by Russia for nearly a decade prior to the war. Ukrainians want to see their nation survive, and they probably want to end the war with security guarantees. After all, Crimea was already seized and that didn&#39;t stop Russia from invading in 2022, so they probably want assurances or membership to NATO to prevent a third violation of their borders. Russia is unlikely to give in either. They&#39;re basically caught holding the bag. They&#39;ve suffered a serious loss in military, economic, and diplomatic capabilities due to this war, it would be disasterous to not come out with something. And, they&#39;ve already formally said they annexed Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson. They seem committed to the battle. The absolute most I could see Ukraine giving up is some concession of autonomy or full territorial control to Russia of Luhansk &amp; Donetsk, as well as giving up any ambitions to Crimea. But they don&#39;t seem to be even considering that as of yet. But, both sides are determined to continue the conflict. Ukraine saw how the Donbas war went, they probably don&#39;t want to let things stall again. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Stalemale? I think so. Frozen conflict? Not really, both sides want to continue fighting and you would be hard pressed to get them to talk. That being said, this &quot;stalemate&quot; is still going to see more action and a more dynamic front than we&#39;d probably see in the Western Front of WW1.</p>\n</div>",
