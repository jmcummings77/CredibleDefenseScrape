As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

The people, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private matters, cautioned that the Persian Gulf nation has yet to make a final decision.\n\n>Asked about the plan, a UAE official said the country takes its responsibilities as a business hub seriously: \u201cThe UAE has a legal export control framework in place and is continuously monitoring the export of dual-use products.\u201d\n\n>Russia has so far been able to get around some of the trade restrictions imposed on it by the US, UK and Europe by routing banned goods via third countries such as the UAE, Turkey and some Central Asian nations that have not introduced sanctions themselves.\n\n>Already a global logistics and trade hub, the UAE has seen a surge in imports of technology such as semi-conductors and advanced electronics from Europe and the US over the past 18 months. Many of these items have been found in Russian weapons in Ukraine or are needed by Moscow to produce them.\n\n>Western officials have ramped up demands in recent months that the UAE stops acting as a gateway for Russia to get around the restrictions. Earlier this month, sanctions envoys from the US, UK and EU visited the UAE to raise their concerns, including that Dubai remains a key transshipment point for components supporting Moscow\u2019s war effort, some of the people said.\n\n>Though so-called dual-use items account for a fraction of Russia\u2019s trade with the UAE, any action that hinders its ability to use a specific trade route is significant because it would make efforts to source essential parts more costly and complicated, they added.\n\n>The UAE is one of several traditional Western allies, including Turkey, that surprised the world last year by refusing to take sides or impose sanctions on Russia. Both have since become magnets for Russian money and business fleeing increasingly hostile jurisdictions elsewhere.\n\n>The EU and US are seeking to persuade so-called intermediary countries to curb the flow of about 45 categories of \u201chigh-priority battlefield items,\u201d including certain advanced technologies, electronics and other components used in cruise missiles, drones and Ka-52 helicopters deployed by Russia against Ukraine.\n\n>The UAE has its own import and export control list, which includes hundreds of chemical and non-chemical items. It would expand that and broadly look to mirror the 45 US and EU categories with its mooted export license program, according to the people. The program would likely require companies re-exporting those items to provide evidence that they\u2019re destined for civilian use.\n\n>>Gray List\n\n>Adopting the permit system could bolster the UAE\u2019s push to be removed early next year from the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force\u2019s gray-list of countries that don\u2019t do enough to uncover illicit fund flows, according to some of the people.\n\n>The EU has already sanctioned several entities registered in the UAE, accusing them of directly supporting Russia\u2019s war machine. The bloc also adopted a new tool in June that would allow member states to ban the export of key goods to companies, and eventually countries, seen as helping Russia get around sanctions.\n\n>That tool, which could ultimately prevent sensitive items from reaching intermediary countries, is expected to be implemented if diplomatic efforts fail.\n\n>The UAE official said the country monitors compliance with sanctions and remains \u201cin close dialog with our international partners, including the United States and European Union, concerning the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.\n\nThis comes after the EU specifically [pushed](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-07/eu-chief-set-to-press-uae-president-on-russia-sanctions-evasion) the Emirates to crack down a couple weeks ago. Recent signs have been building that the U.S. is finally getting serious on actually *enforcing* sanctions by hiring law enforcement types, instead of putting all the onus on their army of finance ivy-leaguers at the Treasury, including OFAC, who work on the policy/strategy side. The [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/world/u-s-plans-to-sanction-scores-of-companies-individuals-accused-of-aiding-russia-33dd2021) recently reported that the DOJ and Commerce are hiring \"scores\" of prosecutors, investigators and analysts to beef up controls. Further, there seems to be more [coordination](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-18/ukraine-asks-germany-to-halt-ammunition-tool-headed-for-russia) between countries to prevent things like extremely critical CNC machines from reaching their destination. Even if Russia can source legacy chips from countries like China (though 30% is still apparently coming from the West,) certain critical tooling, optics and semis are only available from the West. This comes with more secondary sanctions. Still a long way to go on implementation, but some solid baby steps in the right direction.",

The people, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private matters, cautioned that the Persian Gulf nation has yet to make a final decision.</p>\n\n<p>Asked about the plan, a UAE official said the country takes its responsibilities as a business hub seriously: \u201cThe UAE has a legal export control framework in place and is continuously monitoring the export of dual-use products.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Russia has so far been able to get around some of the trade restrictions imposed on it by the US, UK and Europe by routing banned goods via third countries such as the UAE, Turkey and some Central Asian nations that have not introduced sanctions themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Already a global logistics and trade hub, the UAE has seen a surge in imports of technology such as semi-conductors and advanced electronics from Europe and the US over the past 18 months. Many of these items have been found in Russian weapons in Ukraine or are needed by Moscow to produce them.</p>\n\n<p>Western officials have ramped up demands in recent months that the UAE stops acting as a gateway for Russia to get around the restrictions. Earlier this month, sanctions envoys from the US, UK and EU visited the UAE to raise their concerns, including that Dubai remains a key transshipment point for components supporting Moscow\u2019s war effort, some of the people said.</p>\n\n<p>Though so-called dual-use items account for a fraction of Russia\u2019s trade with the UAE, any action that hinders its ability to use a specific trade route is significant because it would make efforts to source essential parts more costly and complicated, they added.</p>\n\n<p>The UAE is one of several traditional Western allies, including Turkey, that surprised the world last year by refusing to take sides or impose sanctions on Russia. Both have since become magnets for Russian money and business fleeing increasingly hostile jurisdictions elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>The EU and US are seeking to persuade so-called intermediary countries to curb the flow of about 45 categories of \u201chigh-priority battlefield items,\u201d including certain advanced technologies, electronics and other components used in cruise missiles, drones and Ka-52 helicopters deployed by Russia against Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>The UAE has its own import and export control list, which includes hundreds of chemical and non-chemical items. It would expand that and broadly look to mirror the 45 US and EU categories with its mooted export license program, according to the people. The program would likely require companies re-exporting those items to provide evidence that they\u2019re destined for civilian use.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Gray List</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Adopting the permit system could bolster the UAE\u2019s push to be removed early next year from the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force\u2019s gray-list of countries that don\u2019t do enough to uncover illicit fund flows, according to some of the people.</p>\n\n<p>The EU has already sanctioned several entities registered in the UAE, accusing them of directly supporting Russia\u2019s war machine. The bloc also adopted a new tool in June that would allow member states to ban the export of key goods to companies, and eventually countries, seen as helping Russia get around sanctions.</p>\n\n<p>That tool, which could ultimately prevent sensitive items from reaching intermediary countries, is expected to be implemented if diplomatic efforts fail.</p>\n\n<p>The UAE official said the country monitors compliance with sanctions and remains \u201cin close dialog with our international partners, including the United States and European Union, concerning the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This comes after the EU specifically <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-07/eu-chief-set-to-press-uae-president-on-russia-sanctions-evasion\">pushed</a> the Emirates to crack down a couple weeks ago. Recent signs have been building that the U.S. is finally getting serious on actually <em>enforcing</em> sanctions by hiring law enforcement types, instead of putting all the onus on their army of finance ivy-leaguers at the Treasury, including OFAC, who work on the policy/strategy side. The <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/u-s-plans-to-sanction-scores-of-companies-individuals-accused-of-aiding-russia-33dd2021\">WSJ</a> recently reported that the DOJ and Commerce are hiring &quot;scores&quot; of prosecutors, investigators and analysts to beef up controls. Further, there seems to be more <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-18/ukraine-asks-germany-to-halt-ammunition-tool-headed-for-russia\">coordination</a> between countries to prevent things like extremely critical CNC machines from reaching their destination. Even if Russia can source legacy chips from countries like China (though 30% is still apparently coming from the West,) certain critical tooling, optics and semis are only available from the West. This comes with more secondary sanctions. Still a long way to go on implementation, but some solid baby steps in the right direction.</p>\n</div>",

The Sudanese Civil War is essentially pitting two brutal aspiring dictators against one another, it's just that one of them happens to be much more open to genocide than the other. \n\nAs far as AZ-AM goes, I personally have strong sympathies for Armenia given their control over that territory dating back thousands of years, and the fact that an Armenian-ethnic majority region that has always been historically Armenian was handed over to the Azerbaijan SSR specifically as a means of divide and rule. It isn't a coincidence the borders between AZ and AM are such a nightmare, it was designed that way by the Soviet Union to pit the locals against one another. Plus, Armenia today only holds a tiny fraction of its historical homeland, and doesn't even control its holy mountain, as a result of the genocide that was carried out by the Ottomans during World War I. Armenia's primary historical benefactor has been *Russia* of all countries, who have repeatedly screwed the Armenians for centuries. \n\nIn other words, while I understand the desire of Azerbaijan to reinstate its control over a territory that had been ethnically cleansed of their people decades ago, and the reestablishment of their internationally recognized borders, the conflict feels like yet another example of Armenia getting handed the shit end of the stick. I'm also not convinced that Azerbaijan is going to stop at the internationally agreed borders either, they want to take more of Armenia proper, further shrinking their already tiny state. And that's not even touching on Azerbaijan's veneration of a man who axe murdered an Armenian in Budapest, or the highly disturbing state-sponsored dehumanizing rhetoric towards Armenians, or the countless videos of Azeri troops raping, mutilating, and killing Armenian prisoners of war.",

It isn&#39;t a coincidence the borders between AZ and AM are such a nightmare, it was designed that way by the Soviet Union to pit the locals against one another. Plus, Armenia today only holds a tiny fraction of its historical homeland, and doesn&#39;t even control its holy mountain, as a result of the genocide that was carried out by the Ottomans during World War I. Armenia&#39;s primary historical benefactor has been <em>Russia</em> of all countries, who have repeatedly screwed the Armenians for centuries. </p>\n\n<p>In other words, while I understand the desire of Azerbaijan to reinstate its control over a territory that had been ethnically cleansed of their people decades ago, and the reestablishment of their internationally recognized borders, the conflict feels like yet another example of Armenia getting handed the shit end of the stick. I&#39;m also not convinced that Azerbaijan is going to stop at the internationally agreed borders either, they want to take more of Armenia proper, further shrinking their already tiny state. And that&#39;s not even touching on Azerbaijan&#39;s veneration of a man who axe murdered an Armenian in Budapest, or the highly disturbing state-sponsored dehumanizing rhetoric towards Armenians, or the countless videos of Azeri troops raping, mutilating, and killing Armenian prisoners of war.</p>\n</div>",

I won't describe the whole episode, but a couple points really stood out that I think leads to some huge ramifications for the UAF in terms of better understanding them as a military force and culture.\n\nKofman, who had visited the Orikhiv-Tokmat axis area during his recent trip, had mentioned in the past on some of his podcasts and his [recent article](https://warontherocks.com/2023/09/perseverance-and-adaptation-ukraines-counteroffensive-at-three-months/) about something interesting that he went into greater detail in the podcast about UAF offensive capabilities and tactics. According to Kofman, due to command and control problems, brigades on the offensive usually bypassed the battalion command level and had the brigade commander directly communicating with the assault companies, of which they typically only attacking with 2-3x companies at a time (out of roughly 9-15x, depending on the brigade and the number of its maneuver battalions).\n\nSo for example, if the 47th Bde is on the attack, of their entire brigade sector, with 3x mechanized battalions, 1x assault battalion, 1x tank battalions, and 1x combat engineer battalion, they'd have only 2-3x reinforced company tactical groups attacking at any given time. Kofman made it a point that they couldn't coordinate more, the battalion and brigade levels aren't sufficient to C2 the fight. Again, Kofman notes that the battalion level command and staff only acts as a legitimate command level during defensive operations, while in offensive operations the battalion level only handles morale related topics and logistics.\n\nWatling, who had visited the Velyka Novosilka axis sector during his recent Ukraine trip, added some very poignant tidbits about what he noticed, which he also wrote in detail in his latest [RUSI report](https://static.rusi.org/Stormbreak-Special-Report-web-final_0.pdf). According to Watling, due to training issues and time frame limitations, the UAF infantry battalion might only actually have 2x platoons who are actually competent at assaults (out of 9x), who are basically picked men of the best of the best of the battalion, given more training because they stand out.\n\nThere was much more said in the podcast that was very interesting and worth discussing, but I want to delve into these two points in greater detail to try to pull some conclusions from Kofman's and Watling's accounts. When I heard those comments they seemed extremely strange but also had something about them that made them seem very familiar too.\n\nA brigade that only actually musters 2-3x reinforced companies to conduct assaults, not 9-15x?\n\nA battalion that has roughly 2x \"elite\" platoons who are actually competent to conduct assaults, placing all their elite in one unit instead of distributing them out and trying to make the whole unit offensively capable, all 9x of them?\n\nWhere have I read about that before?\n\n[Because the Russians did the exact same thing over the winter](https://twitter.com/Tatarigami_UA/status/1629722073487613953). Behold, Storm-Z (before that meant convicts)\n\nThe thing is, the Ukrainians didn't actually copy the Russians (if they even did), it's based on WW2 era Red Army assault organization and tactics, namely the establishment of \"Assault/Storm Groups\" of roughly two platoon sized elite assault troops in a rifle battalion, and elite Assault/Storm Detachments of  roughly battalion strength (2-3 companies) in a rifle regiment or division. More can be found about Red Army assault composition and tactics [here](https://paul-atrydes.livejournal.com/291113.html).\n\nSo here is just another point about their shared military culture and history and how it influences their organization and tactics in modern warfare.\n\nAnyway, I thought this was pretty interesting.",

He has produced the best research work I have read on this war.\n\nNow the controversial take : I think both Kofman and Watling show serious misunderstanding of this war (and to be frank of todays warfare in general) if they stop their thought at just \"Ukrainian are bad at command so they are stuck at using compagnie sized operations\".\n\nSee this interview of Budanov and especially the following part :\n\n>TWZ: Can you talk about how this will progress into the winter? When we first met and I asked if you were concerned about fighting in the cold, you said, 'It's no problem.' So does this pending weather concern you?  \n>  \n>KB: It\u2019s not a problem at all. And as everyone saw last time, it's not a problem to fight in winter for both sides - for us and for Russians. It's not a pleasant thing to do, but it's not a big deal. There's one very important nuance that makes a difference between current warfighting and the previous periods of fighting. Currently, all main instances of fighting are done on foot without using any materiel. This is linked to the high saturation of artillery systems on the forefront and also portable anti-tank weapons.

Yes Ukrainians are fighting similarly to Russians. Or at least the best Russians formations. But that's simply because modern warfare requires it.

He has produced the best research work I have read on this war.</p>\n\n<p>Now the controversial take : I think both Kofman and Watling show serious misunderstanding of this war (and to be frank of todays warfare in general) if they stop their thought at just &quot;Ukrainian are bad at command so they are stuck at using compagnie sized operations&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>See this interview of Budanov and especially the following part :</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>TWZ: Can you talk about how this will progress into the winter? When we first met and I asked if you were concerned about fighting in the cold, you said, &#39;It&#39;s no problem.&#39; So does this pending weather concern you?  </p>\n\n<p>KB: It\u2019s not a problem at all. And as everyone saw last time, it&#39;s not a problem to fight in winter for both sides - for us and for Russians. It&#39;s not a pleasant thing to do, but it&#39;s not a big deal. There&#39;s one very important nuance that makes a difference between current warfighting and the previous periods of fighting. Currently, all main instances of fighting are done on foot without using any materiel. This is linked to the high saturation of artillery systems on the forefront and also portable anti-tank weapons. And that&#39;s true for both sides. Those [armored] systems are not enough to create a gap in the orbits of the enemy  - to create a powerful breakthrough as in classic doctrine. But it is well enough to deter any attempt of the enemy of any side to conduct that breakthrough with materiel and convoys.  </p>\n\n<p>Also, there&#39;s a high level of saturation with both anti-personnel and anti-tank minefields.

But that general and his staff would have to seriously screwed something up to do this bad, even without air superiority, though with plenty of deep strike capabilities.\n\nFor all the shit the Russians rightly get for the horribly botched invasion plan and intelligence assessment, this offensive easily comes in second place. The UAF GenStab totally botched the planning of this offensive. They were NOT at all prepared. \n\nSo forget actual force capabilities and equipment, lets look at choices and how they affect things. \n\nThe offensive was the Ukrainians' idea, they pushed it to the West to get more military aid back in December'22. Why did they plan from the start to use totally untried units as their main effort assault force knowing they'd not even get six months of existence? The US Army would NEVER put it's least trusted units in the main effort. \n\nWhy are only 20% of infantry capable to execute assaults? That doesn't sound like the US Army at all, in no point of our modern history have we settled for that. That would be considered not only a failure of unit leadership. As a former grunt NCO myself, I can't think of the dishonor of being in a grunt rifle squad and being told that I can't be trusted to carry out an assault.

The US Army lives and dies by maneuver warfare, which emphasizes attacking weak points not the strongest of strong points.\n\nMore so, months back, why were the Ukrainian govt so open about their strategy and the targets, outright talking up Melitopol and Berdyansk as far back as [April](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/04/10/leaked-documents-ukraine-counteroffensive/)? I hope the US govt wouldn't be so stupid, but the US Army definitely wouldn't be cool with that. That's as bad as telling the Germans we are going to land at Calais in summer '44, and actually doing that. Where was the deception plan? \n\nDespite making the offensive timing and location blatantly obvious, why didn't they conduct legitimate recon ops or conduct limited recon in force probing attacks over the winter and spring all over the Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk lines to find out what was in front of them and to test Russian TTPs? Maybe they'd have found out about the KA-52 too.\n\nWhy did they ignore lessons from Bakhmut, especially about the increased threat of Lancet drones? That was being pushed all winter and spring, it was not a surprise in the least, and yet it was for the 9th and 10th Corps. Did someone not spread the word? \n\nMine rollers and plows aren't exactly things that need to be made in NATO country factories, anyone with welding competence and access to a junk yard could do wonders. After the major difficulties encountered with mines in the Kherson Bridgehead operation, and knowing the Surovikin Line existed and was even more heavily mined since before the offensive even started being planned, why did the UAF not take drastic internal steps to find solutions to the obstacle problem? The US made all sorts of makeshift mine clearing devices in the shorter lead up to Desert Storm. The USMC and Navy Seabees developed a new type of adhoc roller out of 55 gallon drums and cement that was more effective than the issued one.

They have to cram so absolutely much in such a short time, what they aren't teaching is larger than what they are. And what they do teach they can't put much time into it, so nothing is instinctive when they're done.\n\nPosition building training needs to be prioritized for the junior officers, who are the ones telling the junior enlisted exactly how to build them, directly supervising, and living in them with the troops. Officer training isn't supposed to be as short because they need far more skills than the junior enlisted, and they have to master them. \n\nThough from what I understand a Ukrainian civilian turns into a platoon leader in 4-6 weeks. \n\n>Not all, for example, defensive line was surprisingly tough - mines, for example, the amount was ten times what Ruasian doctrine calls for\n\nThe Kherson bridgehead counteroffensive ended in November, and the AAR for that might as well be one word: Mines. This offensive started in June. That's eight months to create some sort of Ukrainian internal project to deal with mines. But they didn't do anything. That's my beef.\n\nZelensky should have openly been offering $10 million to whoever created the best way to get though the minefields, with runner up prizes too. Turned it into a gigantic fun contest pushed on TV and social media. \n\nIf they wanted to be sneaky, despite openly declaring when and where they were going to attack, they could have sent an army of welders into junk yards to create enough mine plows and rollers for a minimum of one per vehicle, with extras just in case. \n\nThey could have rigged up remote dummy vehicles to take point. They could have marched cattle through them. They could have used an army of sappers to try to open up lanes in the biggest minefields before trying to push vehicles through (which is what they're doing now, after months). Etc. \n\nThey did none of this. They planned to get through the minefields as easily as Kharkiv and be at Melitopol in a week or so. They'd have failed even if the mines were at the normal density.\n\n>Though i am not sure i you know that all these shortcomings are real problems that cannot be simply willed out and sometimes cannot even be fixed by smarter decisions, because they are caused by lack of resources (including human resources, in a way corruption in logostic is increased by poverty, by lack of good institutions, by lack of knowledge how to fix that, by people having incentives to partake in it at every level.

If you do A, you can't do B. \n\nIn this case, since the start of the war they deliberately decided not to invest in training and instead push the troops, supplies, officers who are planners and trainers, etc into combat units to maintain a higher operational tempo, resulting in their ability to fight more meatgrinder fights. This is why I warn against deliberate wars of attrition, because they result in this sort of decision making.\n\nBut they aren't going to stop because 1) nobody important is talking about it 2) when they fail they can blame NATO lack of support 3) at which point they get rewarded with more kit they want.\n\nHow can anyone learn from a mistake if there are no repercussions?",

Officer training isn&#39;t supposed to be as short because they need far more skills than the junior enlisted, and they have to master them. </p>\n\n<p>Though from what I understand a Ukrainian civilian turns into a platoon leader in 4-6 weeks. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Not all, for example, defensive line was surprisingly tough - mines, for example, the amount was ten times what Ruasian doctrine calls for</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Kherson bridgehead counteroffensive ended in November, and the AAR for that might as well be one word: Mines. This offensive started in June. That&#39;s eight months to create some sort of Ukrainian internal project to deal with mines. But they didn&#39;t do anything. That&#39;s my beef.</p>\n\n<p>Zelensky should have openly been offering $10 million to whoever created the best way to get though the minefields, with runner up prizes too. Turned it into a gigantic fun contest pushed on TV and social media. </p>\n\n<p>If they wanted to be sneaky, despite openly declaring when and where they were going to attack, they could have sent an army of welders into junk yards to create enough mine plows and rollers for a minimum of one per vehicle, with extras just in case. </p>\n\n<p>They could have rigged up remote dummy vehicles to take point. They could have marched cattle through them. They could have used an army of sappers to try to open up lanes in the biggest minefields before trying to push vehicles through (which is what they&#39;re doing now, after months). Etc. </p>\n\n<p>They did none of this. They planned to get through the minefields as easily as Kharkiv and be at Melitopol in a week or so. They&#39;d have failed even if the mines were at the normal density.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Though i am not sure i you know that all these shortcomings are real problems that cannot be simply willed out and sometimes cannot even be fixed by smarter decisions, because they are caused by lack of resources (including human resources, in a way corruption in logostic is increased by poverty, by lack of good institutions, by lack of knowledge how to fix that, by people having incentives to partake in it at every level. This is hard problem to solve, improve even. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>High level generaling is about decision making, more so about resource allocation. If you do A, you can&#39;t do B. </p>\n\n<p>In this case, since the start of the war they deliberately decided not to invest in training and instead push the troops, supplies, officers who are planners and trainers, etc into combat units to maintain a higher operational tempo, resulting in their ability to fight more meatgrinder fights. This is why I warn against deliberate wars of attrition, because they result in this sort of decision making.</p>\n\n<p>But they aren&#39;t going to stop because 1) nobody important is talking about it 2) when they fail they can blame NATO lack of support 3) at which point they get rewarded with more kit they want.</p>\n\n<p>How can anyone learn from a mistake if there are no repercussions?</p>\n</div>",

In line platoons in the USMC and in both line platoons and scout platoons and sniper squads in the Army. And we were elite, had try outs and everything, with tough requirements to get in and high standards to stay. But that extra level of selection and training was because we weren't doing the same job any grunt was expected to do, we were doing advanced shit, forward ground recon including into the enemy rear and sniping, both requiring abilities and mindset quite a bit higher than the average grunt. What we didn't do, or at least weren't supposed to be doing was the exact same job as the line platoons, because then that would be a terrific waste. And because then who would do the elite jobs? \n\nAbout SOF being used as conventional infantry, the US SOF forces have done it in the past, though Raqqa wasn't one that I'm aware of and I've read a bit about it. Lots of sniping, EOD, calling in airstrikes, and medical duties, but those aren't normal infantry duties. As part of their FID mission they'd often go out with local national conventional units, the SDF or Kurds when in Syria, but that was because they were advising them besides providing SOF capabilities. And yeah, they had to use lots of heavy fire support, but that's to be expected when the main effort of the offensive force attacking a highly dug in city with suicidal defenders is a very mixed militia force that isn't very professional and not at all organized and trained for that type of campaign. \n\nAnd there is a very long standing history about this subject. It's a very well known problem throughout the world and history of how elite units shouldn't be used as conventional forces especially not in meat grinder fights, because 1) they can do more good doing their SOF job 2) it's too much of a waste, like using a Ferrari as a commuter car in a big city. \n\nSo yeah it happens, including many times in the US, but it's not supposed to happen. When it's done it's either desperation or else a dimwitted commander without the training and common sense to figure out a way to use highly useful but VERY hard to replace elite troops.",

It's just how I interpreted it at least, listening to it twice. Watling in particular said it in a way that the length of training that NATO countries get is an unattainable luxury for countries locked in months in a high intensity war. Sure ~24 weeks he was referencing isn't realistic in a high casualty producing war, but all those NATO countries fought worse meatgrinder wars in the past than this one, and few skimped to the degree that Ukraine has chosen to do on training.\n\nAfter a year and a half of listening to both, Kofman in particular, I've come to the conclusion they cannot say stuff like what I'm bring up, bring up bad policies, strategies, planning because then it means they're criticizing the Ukrainian top commanders and their general staff, who are the ones who made those types of decisions. And if they do that, they'll lose the professional ties and working friendships that allow them to do their jobs. Both always have to be careful in their criticism, or more likely Kofman because Watling almost never says anything actually critical about the Ukrainians, especially never in a negative manner. Kofman has, but nothing too controversial besides discussing Bakhmut, but that was a campaign that had lots of criticism within Ukraine too, Kofman was really just bringing an internal UAF argument to western audiences.\n\nBut despite understanding why Kofman et al don't say it, I feel someone does.\n\n>They seemed to be critical of the fact that they were being trained in ways that were simply either not relevant to battlefield conditions or in ways that the rest of the UAF weren't capable of adapting to, leading to western trained formation reverting to UAF standard practises which they had no training in.\n\nFirst, I think quite a few of their comments on that are indicative of never having actually personally received military training, let alone running it. A lot of their discussions on military training suffers from credibility issues in my opinion. But, mind you, I'm the guy who can't watch war movies or TV shows anymore because the lack of realism is so blatant that it throws me off. I did the job of a professional infantryman NCO long enough that I can spot nonsense a klick out. \n\nSecond, when they do talk about training deficiencies, they don't blame the Ukrainians. And I have a problem with that, because it's not NATO responsibility for Ukraine training shortfalls, going small to big, 1) not supervising 2) not debating the training plan and schedule to ensure it's realistic and high quality 3) not providing better translators 4) not providing more training liaisons that are recent UAF combat vets tasked with Ukraine theater pertinent training especially 5) not totally taking over training and using NATO for operations, logistics and admin support only.\n\nThose need to be brought up because all need to get fixed. After a year and a half and no major changeovers at the top level for cause, these issues are not going to get changed unless they're forced to, and they won't be forced to until popular opinion forces them to.  \n\n>Watling also earlier highlighted how the lack of a proper basic training meant that the majority of soldiers weren't capable of more carrying out more complicated tasks, \n\nPartially true, their initial training was woefully inadequate and their Western provided unit training was likely not very good, but they could have done way more training than that before starting combat ops.  \n\nDOD leaks said most of those new 9th and 10th Corp brigades were formed in January to March, at which point they were supposed to be 100% staffed. While many would have started basic in January, everyone should have been finished by March, then probably done a month of unit training in Germany too, and getting them to early May back to somewhere in Ukraine waiting to be moved to a forward staging area until going on the attack some time June to very late July. But that gave them plenty of time to keep training, especially since the skills they needed could have been done in nearly any flat, rural area for a dry run on a mech or dismounted assault, with a few ad hoc live fire ranges for run phase FTX or actual combat rehearsals.\n\nIf the Ukrainian assault units who knew they were going to be going on the attack couldn't use extra time to train, that's on them. It wouldn't be unique to them either, I've personal seen US combat units too lazy or without initiative to train as much as possible, but it's still frowned upon. It's a symptom of poor leadership.\n\n>which is what's led to the best troops being concentrated in assault detachments. \n\nYes, but that's to do the same job any other grunt is supposed to be able to do. But when the typical grunt platoon can't because of quality issues, that's why the Red Army did the same in WW2, why the Russians did it last winter, and why the Ukrainians are doing it now. \n\nHad they trained more, they'd not need to do that. And I'm not even saying they need to be trained by NATO, I actually don't think they should, I think they could do it better themselves if they put the effort in it to make it the best that is possible in this type of war. \n\nBut they won't, because they can get away with mediocrity at best because nobody is going to pressure them otherwise. After all, they messed up again and are now again getting more weaponry out of it. How are they supposed to learn from their mistakes when they are literally rewarded every time for making mistakes, at the strategic level especially?",

And I have a problem with that, because it&#39;s not NATO responsibility for Ukraine training shortfalls, going small to big, 1) not supervising 2) not debating the training plan and schedule to ensure it&#39;s realistic and high quality 3) not providing better translators 4) not providing more training liaisons that are recent UAF combat vets tasked with Ukraine theater pertinent training especially 5) not totally taking over training and using NATO for operations, logistics and admin support only.</p>\n\n<p>Those need to be brought up because all need to get fixed. After a year and a half and no major changeovers at the top level for cause, these issues are not going to get changed unless they&#39;re forced to, and they won&#39;t be forced to until popular opinion forces them to.  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Watling also earlier highlighted how the lack of a proper basic training meant that the majority of soldiers weren&#39;t capable of more carrying out more complicated tasks, </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Partially true, their initial training was woefully inadequate and their Western provided unit training was likely not very good, but they could have done way more training than that before starting combat ops.  </p>\n\n<p>DOD leaks said most of those new 9th and 10th Corp brigades were formed in January to March, at which point they were supposed to be 100% staffed. While many would have started basic in January, everyone should have been finished by March, then probably done a month of unit training in Germany too, and getting them to early May back to somewhere in Ukraine waiting to be moved to a forward staging area until going on the attack some time June to very late July. But that gave them plenty of time to keep training, especially since the skills they needed could have been done in nearly any flat, rural area for a dry run on a mech or dismounted assault, with a few ad hoc live fire ranges for run phase FTX or actual combat rehearsals.</p>\n\n<p>If the Ukrainian assault units who knew they were going to be going on the attack couldn&#39;t use extra time to train, that&#39;s on them. It wouldn&#39;t be unique to them either, I&#39;ve personal seen US combat units too lazy or without initiative to train as much as possible, but it&#39;s still frowned upon. It&#39;s a symptom of poor leadership.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>which is what&#39;s led to the best troops being concentrated in assault detachments. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes, but that&#39;s to do the same job any other grunt is supposed to be able to do. But when the typical grunt platoon can&#39;t because of quality issues, that&#39;s why the Red Army did the same in WW2, why the Russians did it last winter, and why the Ukrainians are doing it now. </p>\n\n<p>Had they trained more, they&#39;d not need to do that. And I&#39;m not even saying they need to be trained by NATO, I actually don&#39;t think they should, I think they could do it better themselves if they put the effort in it to make it the best that is possible in this type of war. </p>\n\n<p>But they won&#39;t, because they can get away with mediocrity at best because nobody is going to pressure them otherwise. After all, they messed up again and are now again getting more weaponry out of it. How are they supposed to learn from their mistakes when they are literally rewarded every time for making mistakes, at the strategic level especially?</p>\n</div>",

I think overall the relative openness of the battlefield has lead to a reduced capacity to muster large formations to battle. Where we have seen large formations in this conflict outside of the very early stages of the Russian invasion the most common result has been either a swift overpowering of the defenders (ala Kharkiv) or the quick destruction of the attacking force (Vuledar). Given the issues with defenses and minefields and the lack of Ukrainian fire superiority I do not think that using small scale attacks with handpicked and customized companies is a bad plan. It is a slow one, but it entails less risk and can prevent mass casualty events like Vuledar. Should the Ukrainians be doing more training for large scale offensives, probably, but the pressure for more immediate achievements to maintain critical international support likely creates trade offs for the Ukrainians, with the right answer sometimes only becoming obvious in hindsight.",

Where we have seen large formations in this conflict outside of the very early stages of the Russian invasion the most common result has been either a swift overpowering of the defenders (ala Kharkiv) or the quick destruction of the attacking force (Vuledar). Given the issues with defenses and minefields and the lack of Ukrainian fire superiority I do not think that using small scale attacks with handpicked and customized companies is a bad plan. It is a slow one, but it entails less risk and can prevent mass casualty events like Vuledar. Should the Ukrainians be doing more training for large scale offensives, probably, but the pressure for more immediate achievements to maintain critical international support likely creates trade offs for the Ukrainians, with the right answer sometimes only becoming obvious in hindsight.</p>\n</div>",

They did NOTHING to try to get it themselves. And as I've said many times in this sub, a mine plow or roller isn't high tech equipment needed to be made in a western defense factory, it's something anyone with welding equipment and access to a junk yard can create. \n\n>or Shorad to provide cover for the number of simultaneous attacks that you are calling for.\n\nThey have SHORAD, it's just not on the front lines. That was a purposeful decision, no different than the Luftwaffe aircraft and air defenses being prioritized over Germany versus the front lines. \n\n>War is not only fought under ideal circumstances\n\nI never implied they were, but less than ideal circumstances doesn't absolve UAF top leadership from poor decision making. \n\n>Ukraine was and is under pressure to show some sort of results to its international supporters. \n\nSo that's why they refused UAF requests to execute a less costly maneuver defense in Luhansk last summer? That's why they tried to go toe to toe against Russia, while also deciding to launch two counteroffensives elsewhere in the country? Because NATO forced them to? \n\nthey fought it out in Bakhmut all winter despite being warned by supporters not too? Because NATO forced them to? \n\nThis is why Ukraine will never improve, this type of mindset. Nothing is their fault, if they do screw up it's NATOs fault.\n\n>I still remember reading articles all the way up through the beginning of the offensive from the Ukrainian side talking about the lack of equipment needed for a counter offensive in the south of Ukraine. \n\nYeah, to try to unlock more equipment. They've been doing that since day 1 of the war. Because if they don't, if they say they're good to go, they stop getting more. So they always need to cry the blues about not having enough.\n\nMeanwhile, why did THEY pick the most defended area to attack? Why did THEY launch two major supporting efforts, and reinforcing both to make gains, instead of one just to fix enemy?

They did NOTHING to try to get it themselves.

Because NATO forced them to? </p>\n\n<p>they fought it out in Bakhmut all winter despite being warned by supporters not too? Because NATO forced them to? </p>\n\n<p>This is why Ukraine will never improve, this type of mindset. Nothing is their fault, if they do screw up it&#39;s NATOs fault.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I still remember reading articles all the way up through the beginning of the offensive from the Ukrainian side talking about the lack of equipment needed for a counter offensive in the south of Ukraine. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yeah, to try to unlock more equipment. They&#39;ve been doing that since day 1 of the war. Because if they don&#39;t, if they say they&#39;re good to go, they stop getting more. So they always need to cry the blues about not having enough.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, why did THEY pick the most defended area to attack? Why did THEY launch two major supporting efforts, and reinforcing both to make gains, instead of one just to fix enemy? Why did THEY wait three months to mass on Orikhiv instead of on Day 1?</p>\n\n<p>NATOs fault.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>That a nation under severe economic stress in a precarious military position is unable to generate the highest quality forces up to your standards is not surprising.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They aren&#39;t my standards, the standards are what is required to accomplish THEIR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES.</p>\n\n<p>THEY created those objectives, but THEY didn&#39;t do what was necessary to achieve them.

And the reason UA is doing it is most likely because they realize that the actual offensive is done, which is pretty much an open secret at this point\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine continues to take ground, widen its salient, and has shown zero drop in OPTEMPO. So it must be a secret to the Ukrainian command, too. And aren't you the guy who thinks Ukraine has taken *at least* five times more casualties than Russia during the war? Needless to say, I think your sources of information are suspect.\n\nEdit: I see your source for that is Seymour Hersh saying the AFU will mutiny if they have to continue the offensive. Okay.\n\n>Ask yourself why Russia needs BSF in the first place. Those reasons don't suddenly disappear even if BSF was 100% destroyed tomorrow\n\nThe question isn't whether they would continue to want a BSF.

For example, their radios got decrypted and eavesdropped.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This is called SIGINT (signal intelligence) by the intelligence community. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Ground-based and air-based radars see that Ukrainian planes are in flight.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This is why most Ukrainian planes fly close to the ground, literally flying under the radar. The Earth is not flat; ground-based radar can only see as far as the horizon. Air-based radars, including those of Airborne Early Warning and those of Russian fighters, are harder to conceal from. </p>\n\n<p>If the Russian Aerospace Force can track down Ukrainian planes, then they will try shooting down the plane with the missile on it.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Radars see that the cruise missiles are in flight.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Cruise missiles also fly near the ground, to evade ground-based radars. On top of that, Storm Shadow is stealthy. </p>\n\n<p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p>\n\n<p>To evade enemy radars, one crucial information is their position. All those NATO spy planes on the Black Sea and satellites probably have figured out the positions of those radars. Then, one can plot a path for the cruise missile to avoid them.</p>\n\n<p>We know that Ukraine has this information because Ukraine is also striking Russian SAM sites in Crimea.</p>\n</div>",

Despite a truly enormous quantity available, their S-300 missiles lack the capabilities needed to defend against many modern threats like low RCS cruise missiles or sUAS and there aren't enough S-400s to make up the difference. And their SHORAD systems don't seem to be very capable against sUAS, which are too inexpensive to justify using an S-400 or even an S-300 against. The operational costs of keeping CAPs flying are likely prohibitive just in terms of the extra hours on the air frame, so they can't make up the difference in the air.\n\nIt's also likely that the Russians have been forced to redeploy some of their more effective AD systems to defend Moscow and their bases in Russia in response to the stepped up Ukrainian drone campaigns there. So there are fewer systems deployed in Crimea that can be used to defend against the Ukrainians' specific blend of drone and cruise missile strikes. Considering that the effective area of operations for the war so far has been substantially smaller than the entire territory of the Russian Federation, their inability to defend Moscow and Crimea against air attacks from a country which can barely field an air force at all is fairly persuasive evidence that they have major gaps in AD coverage. Which just serves to highlight how absurd their rhetoric about fighting NATO is. If they can't defend against the Ukrainian air force, imagine what the USAF could do to them.",

Their goal was to capture al-Basra in southern Iraq, and press further into Iraq from there. They assembled 150,000-200,000 men for this operation. They managed to break through several of the Iraqi fortifed lines around the city. However they were unable to capture al-Basra completely in part due to superior Iraqi artillery and an over reliance on human-wave assaults. The Battle of al-Basra concluded with Iranian forces suffering 70,000-80,000 casualties, and a failure to capture al-Basra.\n\nThe near constant offensives Iran had conducted for the previous 6 years had bled the Iranian Army white. After stunning losses at al-Basra, Iran decided to make only tactical charges along some of the front instead of operational pushes.\nMobilization efforts ran short, and the Iranian Army's morale was shot. \n\nMeanwhile Iraq had been steadily improving during this time. Around 1984, Iraq began to pull certain formations off the front line, and train them to be used in counter attacking operations. Eventually, these \"Republican Guard\" formations were also equipped with the best equipment Iraq had to offer, and were more mobile than other units in the Iraqi Army. Amongst the entire army, command & control had improved by a significant margin, and had a significant road network which allowed it to conduct rapid offensives if necessary. \n\nIn 1988, Iraq launched it's first of 5 major offensives in the south that would essentially conclude the war. \"Operation Ramadan Mubarak\", launched at al-Faw, saw a massive force of 100,000 Iraqi's overrun 15,000 Iranian's via superior numbers and an overwhelming advantage in artillery and tanks.\n\nAgain at Fish Lake, the Iraqi's attacked an Iranian salient, using their superior mobility to outflank the Iranian's and route them. They captured 150 artillery pieces, and 100 tanks. At the Majnun Islands, via a classic pincer movement, the Iraqi Army smashed 6-8 Iranian divisions and captured all the Iranian equipment. At Dehlo, the Iraqi Army again conducted a pincer attack, driving dozens of miles into Iranian territory and routing/encircling numerous Iranian units. I think I might be missing an Iraqi offensive ot two, but you get the point.\n\nAs per Kenneth Pollack in Arabs at War, Military Effectiveness, 1948-1991, \"These five offensives effectively destroyed Iran's remaining ground power, leaving the country defenseless and forcing Tehran to accept a ceasefire. All told, the Iraqis captured about 600 tanks, 400 other armored vehicles, and 400 artillery pieces in these battles.\" \n\nBy war's end, the Iranian Army had been shattered. Operating less than 50 tanks, along with less than 50 aircraft, compared to Iraq's stunning advantage of 4,000(ish) tanks and 1,000 aircraft. Iraq had complete control of the battlefield, and could make limited drives into Iran at will. \n\nMy goal here isn't to make the Iraqi Army seem like some nigh-unbeatable juggernaut, (See: First Gulf War), but to point out that Iraq very much had an upper hand by 1988.\n\nIf I were daring, I would liken Iraq's final battlefield victories in 1988 more to the last offensives of WW1 than to the Korean War. \n\nSources:\n1) Kenneth Pollack: Arabs at War, Military Effectiveness, 1948-1991\n2) Anthony H.

Iraq had complete control of the battlefield, and could make limited drives into Iran at will. </p>\n\n<p>My goal here isn&#39;t to make the Iraqi Army seem like some nigh-unbeatable juggernaut, (See: First Gulf War), but to point out that Iraq very much had an upper hand by 1988.</p>\n\n<p>If I were daring, I would liken Iraq&#39;s final battlefield victories in 1988 more to the last offensives of WW1 than to the Korean War. </p>\n\n<p>Sources:\n1) Kenneth Pollack: Arabs at War, Military Effectiveness, 1948-1991\n2) Anthony H.

Reportedly, the head of the Russian military department got acquainted with missile weapons, unmanned aerial vehicles, as well as Iranian-made air defense systems.\n\nWhat's interesting is that the delegation, among other things, was shown some types of weapons that had not been officially and publicly demonstrated to anyone in Iran before.\n\nSo in these shots you can see the very Iranian loitering missile for hitting UAVs and helicopters, which the Houthis successfully used in Yemen. The original Iranian name of the missile is still unknown. The Americans, after intercepting a couple of batches at sea, designated them as \"missile 358\".

They are sitting next to the Bab al-Mandeb strait where up to 30% of the world's oil, including all of the oil and natural gas from the Persian Gulf heading west passes through the Bab El-Mandab strait. Having its proxy forces being able to threaten this strait serves its strategic posture.\n\nMoreover, giving the Houthis ballistic missiles and drones that can reach Tel Aviv from Sanaa gives it the ability to open another front against Israel in case of war.\n\nAnd next month, on 18 October to be precisely, UNSC sanctions that ban Iran from importing and exporting missiles will expire. I wouldn't be surprised if Iran has waited for this to expire before flooding Russia with numerous weapon systems. The fact that Shoigu has visited Tehran with a huge delegation to closely inspect different missiles isn't a coincidence.",
