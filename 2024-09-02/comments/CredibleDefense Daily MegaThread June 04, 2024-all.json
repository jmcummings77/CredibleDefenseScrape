The national fire service said its firefighters were operating late into the night in several spots, including in the town of Kiryat Shmona, where they were trying to protect a line of houses.\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/fires-set-off-by-hezbollah-rockets-spread-through-northern-israel-2024-06-03/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/fires-set-off-by-hezbollah-rockets-spread-through-northern-israel-2024-06-03/)\n\n>The large fire was sparked by a barrage of rockets and several drones launched by Hezbollah at the area on Sunday. According to the Israel Nature and Parks Authority, bushfires consumed 10,000 dunams (over 2,470 acres) of foliage in open areas, including nature reserves.\n\n[https://www.timesofisrael.com/war-cabinet-set-to-huddle-as-blazes-sparked-by-hezbollah-attacks-scorch-north/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/war-cabinet-set-to-huddle-as-blazes-sparked-by-hezbollah-attacks-scorch-north/)\n\nHezbollah also launched a heavy rocket at a military base which lead to significant damage:\n\n>The Israeli army announced on Saturday that the Lebanese group Hezbollah launched a Volcano missile toward the Gibor military camp in the northern settlement of Kiryat Shmona, resulting in \u201csignificant damage.\u201d\n\n>\u201cHezbollah launched a Volcano missile this morning, hitting the Gibor camp, which is the headquarters of the 769th Brigade in the city of Kiryat Shmona,\u201d the Israeli army radio said.\n\n>The radio indicated \u201csignificant damage\u201d to the camp, without mentioning any human casualties.\n\n[https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/israeli-army-reports-significant-damage-following-hezbollahs-targeting-of-kiryat-shmona/3237416](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/israeli-army-reports-significant-damage-following-hezbollahs-targeting-of-kiryat-shmona/3237416)\n\nA video of the launch and destruction can be seen here: [https://x.com/orfialkov/status/1797656708719772150](https://x.com/orfialkov/status/1797656708719772150)\n\nLosses are only low because Israel evacuated around 100.000 people from Northern Israel.

The national fire service said its firefighters were operating late into the night in several spots, including in the town of Kiryat Shmona, where they were trying to protect a line of houses.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/fires-set-off-by-hezbollah-rockets-spread-through-northern-israel-2024-06-03/\">https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/fires-set-off-by-hezbollah-rockets-spread-through-northern-israel-2024-06-03/</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The large fire was sparked by a barrage of rockets and several drones launched by Hezbollah at the area on Sunday. According to the Israel Nature and Parks Authority, bushfires consumed 10,000 dunams (over 2,470 acres) of foliage in open areas, including nature reserves.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/war-cabinet-set-to-huddle-as-blazes-sparked-by-hezbollah-attacks-scorch-north/\">https://www.timesofisrael.com/war-cabinet-set-to-huddle-as-blazes-sparked-by-hezbollah-attacks-scorch-north/</a></p>\n\n<p>Hezbollah also launched a heavy rocket at a military base which lead to significant damage:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Israeli army announced on Saturday that the Lebanese group Hezbollah launched a Volcano missile toward the Gibor military camp in the northern settlement of Kiryat Shmona, resulting in \u201csignificant damage.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHezbollah launched a Volcano missile this morning, hitting the Gibor camp, which is the headquarters of the 769th Brigade in the city of Kiryat Shmona,\u201d the Israeli army radio said.</p>\n\n<p>The radio indicated \u201csignificant damage\u201d to the camp, without mentioning any human casualties.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/israeli-army-reports-significant-damage-following-hezbollahs-targeting-of-kiryat-shmona/3237416\">https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/israeli-army-reports-significant-damage-following-hezbollahs-targeting-of-kiryat-shmona/3237416</a></p>\n\n<p>A video of the launch and destruction can be seen here: <a href=\"https://x.com/orfialkov/status/1797656708719772150\">https://x.com/orfialkov/status/1797656708719772150</a></p>\n\n<p>Losses are only low because Israel evacuated around 100.000 people from Northern Israel.

They certainly did so at least once, during the incident that caused a diplomatic kerfuffle which you mentioned. Although its ABM capabilities are unmatched, PATRIOT's ability to knock Russian fighter jets out of the sky seems to have been sufficient justification for the Ukrainians to deploy at least one battery as traditional AA rather than purely for ABM defense, and thus to risk exposing the battery to Russian long range fires by positioning it relatively close to the front, where it can launch against Russian fast jets dropping glide bombs. I doubt they're much closer than 30km from the frontlines, though. At that distance from the lines, they are unlikely to be spotted by Russian ISR assets unless they are super unlucky, although the odds are of course much higher than they would be in western Ukraine in the strategic rear.\n\nI am guessing we will see more PATRIOT ambushes over time simply because they work, and it is cheaper and more efficient to shoot one Russian plane down with one MIM-104 than it is to shoot down the many individual missiles that the same plane can launch with a correspondingly number of MIM-104s. And also because the Ukrainians will very shortly want to hold Russian aviation at risk from the ground to support complementary F-16 ops holding the same jets at risk from the air. When the Vipers are fighting air-to-air, overlapping GBAD coverage will help them consistently win BVR engagements against Russian interceptors equipped with R77 missiles by forcing them to defend simultaneously against MIM-104s and whatever AA missiles end up in the F-16s' loadout (whether that's AMRAAMs, RIM-7s, Meteors, or something else). If the Vipers are instead attacking ground targets, PATRIOTs can provide cover against the same Russian CAPs, ideally forcing them to maintain greater than R77 range offset from the F-16s' bombing run LAR so they can launch against targets on the ground unimpeded by enemy fires.",

They simply could not believe that Hitler, a man they had absolute and unwavering confidence in had led them to this end and that it *must* therefore be a conspiracy.    \n    \n>As con\u00adfid\u00adence in Ger\u00adman vic\u00adtory dis\u00adin\u00adteg\u00adrated, many sol\u00addiers also de\u00adveloped a sense of sym\u00adpathy with Hitler, which was based on con\u00adspir\u00adacy the\u00ador\u00adies. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for the F\u00dcHRER, the poor devil never sleeps peace\u00adfully,\u201d one POW said. \u201cHis in\u00adten\u00adtions were good, but what a gov\u00adern\u00adment!\u201d An\u00adother seconded that sen\u00adti\u00adment:\n\n>ERFURTH: How fright\u00adful! What trouble that poor man (HITLER) takes and how he is al\u00adways dis\u00adap\u00adpoin\u00adted! The way every\u00adone lets him down!    \n    \n>Even a high-rank\u00ading of\u00adficer like Field Mar\u00adshal Er\u00adhard Milch put forth a vari\u00adation of this con\u00adspir\u00adacy the\u00adory. In May 1945, he pro\u00adposed:\n\n>MILCH: The F\u00dcHRER in 1940/41 was not the man he was in 1934/35, but was com\u00adpletely con\u00adfused, and had com\u00adpletely wrong ideas and fol\u00adlowed these wrong ideas. He must have been made ill, I\u2019m con\u00advinced of that, though of course too much re\u00adspons\u00adib\u00adil\u00adity is enough to make you ill on its own.\n\n>In an\u00adother ex\u00adample, a POW re\u00adgret\u00adted that the con\u00adstant ma\u00adnip\u00adu\u00adla\u00adtion of Hitler un\u00adjustly di\u00admin\u00adished his his\u00adtor\u00adical sig\u00adni\u00adfic\u00adance. But even more lam\u00adent\u00adable was the fact that the mis\u00adin\u00adform\u00ada\u00adtion of the F\u00fchrer had led to things for which the Ger\u00adman mil\u00adit\u00adary was now go\u00ading to be held re\u00adspons\u00adible. Ma\u00adjor Gen\u00aderal Re\u00aditer ar\u00adtic\u00adu\u00adlated this fear:\n\n>REITER: He was a his\u00adtor\u00adical fig\u00adure; only his\u00adtory will be able to give him his proper due; one must first hear all that happened; we have heard noth\u00ading. Those in\u00adcom\u00adpet\u00adent fools who never told the F\u00dcHRER that he was be\u00ading lied to in re\u00adports etc! We, too, shall be blamed for that, you can be sure of that.    \n    \nThe propaganda around the Hitler myth, a man who could do no wrong, therefore it *must* be those stupid senior officers meddling and not giving him accurate information.

                    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>One of the main reactions was what actually spawned the myth post-war that Hitler had been let down by interfering generals. They simply could not believe that Hitler, a man they had absolute and unwavering confidence in had led them to this end and that it <em>must</em> therefore be a conspiracy.    </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>As con\u00adfid\u00adence in Ger\u00adman vic\u00adtory dis\u00adin\u00adteg\u00adrated, many sol\u00addiers also de\u00adveloped a sense of sym\u00adpathy with Hitler, which was based on con\u00adspir\u00adacy the\u00ador\u00adies. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for the F\u00dcHRER, the poor devil never sleeps peace\u00adfully,\u201d one POW said. \u201cHis in\u00adten\u00adtions were good, but what a gov\u00adern\u00adment!\u201d An\u00adother seconded that sen\u00adti\u00adment:</p>\n\n<p>ERFURTH: How fright\u00adful!

The way every\u00adone lets him down!    </p>\n\n<p>Even a high-rank\u00ading of\u00adficer like Field Mar\u00adshal Er\u00adhard Milch put forth a vari\u00adation of this con\u00adspir\u00adacy the\u00adory. In May 1945, he pro\u00adposed:</p>\n\n<p>MILCH: The F\u00dcHRER in 1940/41 was not the man he was in 1934/35, but was com\u00adpletely con\u00adfused, and had com\u00adpletely wrong ideas and fol\u00adlowed these wrong ideas. He must have been made ill, I\u2019m con\u00advinced of that, though of course too much re\u00adspons\u00adib\u00adil\u00adity is enough to make you ill on its own.</p>\n\n<p>In an\u00adother ex\u00adample, a POW re\u00adgret\u00adted that the con\u00adstant ma\u00adnip\u00adu\u00adla\u00adtion of Hitler un\u00adjustly di\u00admin\u00adished his his\u00adtor\u00adical sig\u00adni\u00adfic\u00adance. But even more lam\u00adent\u00adable was the fact that the mis\u00adin\u00adform\u00ada\u00adtion of the F\u00fchrer had led to things for which the Ger\u00adman mil\u00adit\u00adary was now go\u00ading to be held re\u00adspons\u00adible.

We, too, shall be blamed for that, you can be sure of that.    </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The propaganda around the Hitler myth, a man who could do no wrong, therefore it <em>must</em> be those stupid senior officers meddling and not giving him accurate information.

Once one unit or command or even the one engineer that figures it out actually works through the issue, how does and how quickly does the information and know how spread to other units? \n\n[The Defense Forces of Ukraine Officially Demonstrated 9K33 Osa SAM System with New Missiles | Defense Express | June 2024](https://en.defence-ua.com/news/the_defense_forces_of_ukraine_officially_demonstrated_9k33_osa_sam_system_with_new_missiles_video-10732.html)\n\n*Expansion of a range of missiles for the Osa SAM system with the Soviet-made R-73 short-range air-to-air missile (NATO reporting name AA-11 Archer) also directly indicates the possibility to integrate Western AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missile*\n\n*The Armed Forces of Ukraine released the first public official video of the surface-to-air missile system that has received new missiles. The 1129th Anti-Aircraft Missile Regiment showed the relevant video. Later it was also published by the Operational Command North.*\n\n*The video is dedicated to the fight against Russian reconnaissance UAVs. The video captures the launch and successful damage of such a target using a standard 9M33 missile, which has radio command guidance.*\n\n*But attention should be paid to the other missile, which is on the other side of the launcher. Although at this range we can tell that it is white and has developed empennage. This is the first official video by the Armed Forces of Ukraine with R-73 air-to-air missile mounted on the Osa SAM system. Although a photo of this system with such missiles has been reported by some media for quite some time, but there has been no official image before.*\n\n*As Defense Express, we note that the use of the R-73 as a surface-to-air missile is a rather logical way, given the need to provide Soviet air defense systems with missiles in general. At the same time, the R-73 is a rather interesting option. Because it is a missile with the range of target destruction of about 12 km when it is launched from the ground. At least that is the range that the Yugoslavs got with their Pracka RL-4 system. This is 2-3 kilometers further than the capabilities of the standard 9M33 missile, which weighs slightly more (128 kg vs. 105 kg) but has a more powerful warhead (15 kg vs. 8 kg).*\n\n*But the difference between these missiles is actually quite significant. The 9M33 uses radio command guidance, i.e., it is controlled by the SAM system, while the R-73 has an infrared homing. That is why the 9M33 is better used to defeat drones, while the R-73 can demonstrate better results against cruise missiles and other targets.*\n\n*It should be noted that the R-73 missile was chosen as a weapon for Magura V5 naval drones, which, through this integration, became the first unmanned naval air defense systems. The moderate dimensions of the missile and the capabilities of the MK-80 homing with a 75-degree field of view and 45-degree aiming angles obviously played in favor of this decision.*\n\n*Although a maritime drone's thermal imaging camera can detect targets, the operator must orient the missile toward the target and wait for the homing to lock onto the drone. Approximately the same algorithm should be used by the operator of the Osa SAM system to launch the R-73 missiles.*\n\n*It should also be noted that the integration of the R-73 air-to-air missile on the Osa SAM system will not be very different from the integration of a similar air-to-air missile with an AIM-9 infrared homing. But it also should be recalled that the United States has officially announced about transferring AIM-9M to the Armed Forces of Ukraine for the FrankenSAM project.*",

            "body": "This article is extremely misleading. Almost to the point that I would just remove it, but I think it's close enough to credible to pass the sniff test, so is at least worth deconstructing rather than blocking. For a better summary, [this Congressional Research Service report on the same topic is far more informative](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12084). \n\nAs for what specifically I find objectionable in the Asia Times article:\n\nThe subtitle describes SLCM-N as an \"[e]scalatory move.\" That's beyond ridiculous. Both Russia and China have tactical nuclear weapon capable cruise missile systems deployed in the Indo-Pacific. The US does not. It's not escalatory to match the capabilities of a rival at parity. You might as well accuse Ukraine of escalating the war by sending tanks into the Donbas to fend off Russian tanks. \n\nThe history of the program provides some helpful perspective. The US lacks a comparable capability to the various Russian and Chinese nuclear-capable cruise missiles because America voluntarily eliminated nearly all its tactical nuclear weapons systems during the optimistic days of the 1990s peace dividend. They stored a small reserve of modified Tomahawk cruise missiles (TLAM-N), which became the Navy's only *tactical* nuclear delivery capability that wasn't reliant on the questionable survivability of aircraft carriers floating around in the middle of a nuke fight. \n\nBy 2013, the Navy retired the remaining modified Tomahawks with no plans to replace the capability. In 2018, the Trump administration requested budget from Congress for the SLCM-N program, in theory to fill the gap the retired Tomahawks left. Proponents argued SLCM-N would enhance the credibility of US reassurances to its allies in the Pacific that it is able to deter Chinese or Russian nuclear aggression against them. However, the Biden administration--at the request of the Navy itself--cut the program from each annual presidential DoD budget request since 2021, in favor of higher priority modernization projects.\n\nThe consensus in the DoD and Navy has been that the SLCM-N capability would generate little deterrent effect beyond what SLBMs already provide, while adding disproportionate cost and complexity to operations by requiring sailors across the surface and submarine fleets to train on an entirely new nuclear-capable missile system, at the expense of time, budget, organizational complexity, and even storage space that could otherwise be allocated to much more frequently legal--and therefore useful--conventional weapons. Congress nevertheless allocated the money to establish the SLCM-N program, over both the objections of the administration and the Navy. \n\nEven so, is it *really* escalatory simply to replace an outdated capability that has fallen into disuse?\n\nThe OP subtitle further suggests that it would be escalatory to \"forward-deploy long-range nuke missiles.\" Despite repeatedly discussing SLBMs, the author apparently failed to recognize that the US already \"forward deploys\" strategic nuclear missiles aboard its Ohio-class boomers, so the lesser threat of tactical nuclear cruise missiles does not represent an escalation over the status quo, but rather redundant backup for an existing capability. The redundancy being precisely why the Navy wants to cut the program to begin with.\n\nArguably, it is valuable to maintain a tactical nuclear option that is survivable even in scenarios where China launches a devastating first strike against US forces across the Pacific. A tactical capability allows for a more fine-grained ladder of escalation between a limited tactical nuclear operation and a far more destructive unlimited strategic nuclear war. However, SLBMs provide pretty much all of the same benefits, and any scenario where the US is sufficiently desperate that it willingly resorts to nuclear weapons at all would almost certainly call for higher yield warheads anyway.\n\nAs a practical example: a 100kt strategic warhead like the American W76 bomb dropped with no airburst has a thermal radiation radius of around 4.4km (i.e., that's about as far away as it might kill people directly), with a fireball radius around 500m (i.e., it will absolutely erase anything within that distance of the detonation point). For a tactical 10kt bomb, the TRR is only around 1.5km with a 100m fireball. Still extremely destructive of course, and it would not be safe to linger within the fallout, but without near direct hits, a handful of 10kt bombs might not stop a determined surface fleet if it's able to dodge between fireballs, especially since naval vessels often have specialized HVAC and CBRN gear for surviving the fallout. Or a military base that stretches over many kilometers might require many 10kt nukes to fully disable. A Chinese invasion fleet in open waters would almost certainly cover a radius in the dozens of kilometers, requiring potentially hundreds of tactical yield weapons to ensure complete destruction.\n\n\"a move that could reshape its deterrence strategy amid rising tensions with China and Russia.\" In what way does adding one relatively minor system to America's already indisputably fearsome nuclear capabilities represent a \"reshap[ing]\" of US deterrence strategy?\n\n\"The testimony underscored the delicate balance required to execute the SLCM-N program effectively considering the limited pool of experienced government personnel and the degraded state of the [nuclear weapons industrial base](https://asiatimes.com/2024/01/sentinel-setbacks-expose-aged-and-decrepit-us-nukes/).\" The testimony said nothing at all about the US nuclear weapons industrial base being in a \"degraded state,\" and the author only cites to his own separate article as evidence of the claim.\n\nIn that cited article, the author makes the absolutely *preposterous* claim that, \"Delays in LGM-35A Sentinel production could mean that the US has to rely on increasingly obsolete nuclear weapons for strategic deterrence, in contrast to its near-peer adversaries China and Russia, both of which have continuously modernized their nuclear arsenals.\" It's hard to overstate just how dumb of a take that is. The US has not one but two generations of stealth/low-observability strategic bombers compared to zero for China and Russia, and a fully capable and functional nuclear ballistic missile fleet, which happily lacks the long history of accidents, incompetence, extreme under-funding, and neglect that plague Russia's sub fleet in the lean post-Soviet years. For their part, the PLAN simply doesn't yet have a comparable capability. Meanwhile, US boomers maintain decisive technical advantages over Russian and Chinese  anti-submarine warfare platforms. Giving the US not one but two entirely independent nuclear weapons platforms categorically superior to anything China or Russia can field.\n\nThen, there are ICBMs, where in recent years Russia and China arguably spent more R&D rubles and yuan than Uncle Sam spent dollars. Yet, China and Russia BM R&D mostly focuses on novel capabilities to counter current or projected American anti-ballistic missile systems. e.g., they made Kinzhals hypersonic to evade ABM interceptors, but reportedly PATRIOT PAC-3s still catch them. We can be fairly confident that US BM capabilities far exceed Russian equivalents because of how poorly S-400s defend against even outdated western missiles like ATACMS, and because of how well PATRIOT defends against even premiere Russian missile tech like Kinzhal. The Russians might blow all their research rubles on missiles, but they aren't developing new tech to gain novel advantage over the US, rather to preserve whatever they can of a minimally credible second strike threat against the US.\n\nEven those flashy high end missile R&D projects are more for show than anything else. Like with the T-14, the Su-57, the BMP Terminator, and every other post-Soviet Russian military R&D project, the Russians grossly exaggerate their successes while struggling to deliver even minimally capable equipment and/or munitions. The Ru MOD always publicizes the hell out of Satan ICBM tests and underwater nuclear torpedo tests, but never demonstrate any impressive or useful capabilities (or any capabilities at all, in the case of that torpedo, which has suffered through many canceled and zero successful field tests). That problem will only worsen as programs like the Satan increasingly compete for limited acquisition budgets against less flashy but more immediately valuable items that directly support the war effort in Ukraine. \n\nW/r/t China, there's absolutely no evidence and little chance the PLARF (or whatever it's called now) have achieved technical parity with US ICBMs. Besides, the US probably has more Minuteman IIIs than China has nuclear warheads in total (~400 v. ~300, respectively).  \n\nMost importantly, the OP article completely distorts the US position by conflating the existence of an acquisitions project with a decision to then subsequently forward deploy the acquired weapons system. \"Escalatory move would forward-deploy long-range nuke missiles on Virginia-class attack subs to close a deterrence gap with China.\" Nowhere in any of the sources OP links (nor in the source I linked), and nowhere in reality, has the US considered actually forward deploying sub-launched cruise missiles equipped with tactical nuclear warheads to deter China (as opposed to merely developing the capability to expand deterrence options during a crisis). A congressional commission identified forward deployability as a critical requirement for a credible nuclear deterrent, and proponents of SLCM-N argue it might help satisfy that requirement, but no one is \"mulling\" over specific, escalatory forward deployment plans at this point in time.\n\nAll of which is to say OP is way off target in many important respects and borders on the non-credible.",
            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>This article is extremely misleading. Almost to the point that I would just remove it, but I think it&#39;s close enough to credible to pass the sniff test, so is at least worth deconstructing rather than blocking. For a better summary, <a href=\"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12084\">this Congressional Research Service report on the same topic is far more informative</a>. </p>\n\n<p>As for what specifically I find objectionable in the Asia Times article:</p>\n\n<p>The subtitle describes SLCM-N as an &quot;[e]scalatory move.&quot; That&#39;s beyond ridiculous. Both Russia and China have tactical nuclear weapon capable cruise missile systems deployed in the Indo-Pacific. The US does not. It&#39;s not escalatory to match the capabilities of a rival at parity. You might as well accuse Ukraine of escalating the war by sending tanks into the Donbas to fend off Russian tanks. </p>\n\n<p>The history of the program provides some helpful perspective. The US lacks a comparable capability to the various Russian and Chinese nuclear-capable cruise missiles because America voluntarily eliminated nearly all its tactical nuclear weapons systems during the optimistic days of the 1990s peace dividend. They stored a small reserve of modified Tomahawk cruise missiles (TLAM-N), which became the Navy&#39;s only <em>tactical</em> nuclear delivery capability that wasn&#39;t reliant on the questionable survivability of aircraft carriers floating around in the middle of a nuke fight. </p>\n\n<p>By 2013, the Navy retired the remaining modified Tomahawks with no plans to replace the capability. In 2018, the Trump administration requested budget from Congress for the SLCM-N program, in theory to fill the gap the retired Tomahawks left. Proponents argued SLCM-N would enhance the credibility of US reassurances to its allies in the Pacific that it is able to deter Chinese or Russian nuclear aggression against them. However, the Biden administration--at the request of the Navy itself--cut the program from each annual presidential DoD budget request since 2021, in favor of higher priority modernization projects.</p>\n\n<p>The consensus in the DoD and Navy has been that the SLCM-N capability would generate little deterrent effect beyond what SLBMs already provide, while adding disproportionate cost and complexity to operations by requiring sailors across the surface and submarine fleets to train on an entirely new nuclear-capable missile system, at the expense of time, budget, organizational complexity, and even storage space that could otherwise be allocated to much more frequently legal--and therefore useful--conventional weapons. Congress nevertheless allocated the money to establish the SLCM-N program, over both the objections of the administration and the Navy. </p>\n\n<p>Even so, is it <em>really</em> escalatory simply to replace an outdated capability that has fallen into disuse?</p>\n\n<p>The OP subtitle further suggests that it would be escalatory to &quot;forward-deploy long-range nuke missiles.&quot; Despite repeatedly discussing SLBMs, the author apparently failed to recognize that the US already &quot;forward deploys&quot; strategic nuclear missiles aboard its Ohio-class boomers, so the lesser threat of tactical nuclear cruise missiles does not represent an escalation over the status quo, but rather redundant backup for an existing capability. The redundancy being precisely why the Navy wants to cut the program to begin with.</p>\n\n<p>Arguably, it is valuable to maintain a tactical nuclear option that is survivable even in scenarios where China launches a devastating first strike against US forces across the Pacific. A tactical capability allows for a more fine-grained ladder of escalation between a limited tactical nuclear operation and a far more destructive unlimited strategic nuclear war. However, SLBMs provide pretty much all of the same benefits, and any scenario where the US is sufficiently desperate that it willingly resorts to nuclear weapons at all would almost certainly call for higher yield warheads anyway.</p>\n\n<p>As a practical example: a 100kt strategic warhead like the American W76 bomb dropped with no airburst has a thermal radiation radius of around 4.4km (i.e., that&#39;s about as far away as it might kill people directly), with a fireball radius around 500m (i.e., it will absolutely erase anything within that distance of the detonation point). For a tactical 10kt bomb, the TRR is only around 1.5km with a 100m fireball. Still extremely destructive of course, and it would not be safe to linger within the fallout, but without near direct hits, a handful of 10kt bombs might not stop a determined surface fleet if it&#39;s able to dodge between fireballs, especially since naval vessels often have specialized HVAC and CBRN gear for surviving the fallout. Or a military base that stretches over many kilometers might require many 10kt nukes to fully disable. A Chinese invasion fleet in open waters would almost certainly cover a radius in the dozens of kilometers, requiring potentially hundreds of tactical yield weapons to ensure complete destruction.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;a move that could reshape its deterrence strategy amid rising tensions with China and Russia.&quot; In what way does adding one relatively minor system to America&#39;s already indisputably fearsome nuclear capabilities represent a &quot;reshap[ing]&quot; of US deterrence strategy?</p>\n\n<p>&quot;The testimony underscored the delicate balance required to execute the SLCM-N program effectively considering the limited pool of experienced government personnel and the degraded state of the <a href=\"https://asiatimes.com/2024/01/sentinel-setbacks-expose-aged-and-decrepit-us-nukes/\">nuclear weapons industrial base</a>.&quot; The testimony said nothing at all about the US nuclear weapons industrial base being in a &quot;degraded state,&quot; and the author only cites to his own separate article as evidence of the claim.</p>\n\n<p>In that cited article, the author makes the absolutely <em>preposterous</em> claim that, &quot;Delays in LGM-35A Sentinel production could mean that the US has to rely on increasingly obsolete nuclear weapons for strategic deterrence, in contrast to its near-peer adversaries China and Russia, both of which have continuously modernized their nuclear arsenals.&quot; It&#39;s hard to overstate just how dumb of a take that is. The US has not one but two generations of stealth/low-observability strategic bombers compared to zero for China and Russia, and a fully capable and functional nuclear ballistic missile fleet, which happily lacks the long history of accidents, incompetence, extreme under-funding, and neglect that plague Russia&#39;s sub fleet in the lean post-Soviet years. For their part, the PLAN simply doesn&#39;t yet have a comparable capability. Meanwhile, US boomers maintain decisive technical advantages over Russian and Chinese  anti-submarine warfare platforms. Giving the US not one but two entirely independent nuclear weapons platforms categorically superior to anything China or Russia can field.</p>\n\n<p>Then, there are ICBMs, where in recent years Russia and China arguably spent more R&amp;D rubles and yuan than Uncle Sam spent dollars. Yet, China and Russia BM R&amp;D mostly focuses on novel capabilities to counter current or projected American anti-ballistic missile systems. e.g., they made Kinzhals hypersonic to evade ABM interceptors, but reportedly PATRIOT PAC-3s still catch them. We can be fairly confident that US BM capabilities far exceed Russian equivalents because of how poorly S-400s defend against even outdated western missiles like ATACMS, and because of how well PATRIOT defends against even premiere Russian missile tech like Kinzhal. The Russians might blow all their research rubles on missiles, but they aren&#39;t developing new tech to gain novel advantage over the US, rather to preserve whatever they can of a minimally credible second strike threat against the US.</p>\n\n<p>Even those flashy high end missile R&amp;D projects are more for show than anything else. Like with the T-14, the Su-57, the BMP Terminator, and every other post-Soviet Russian military R&amp;D project, the Russians grossly exaggerate their successes while struggling to deliver even minimally capable equipment and/or munitions. The Ru MOD always publicizes the hell out of Satan ICBM tests and underwater nuclear torpedo tests, but never demonstrate any impressive or useful capabilities (or any capabilities at all, in the case of that torpedo, which has suffered through many canceled and zero successful field tests). That problem will only worsen as programs like the Satan increasingly compete for limited acquisition budgets against less flashy but more immediately valuable items that directly support the war effort in Ukraine. </p>\n\n<p>W/r/t China, there&#39;s absolutely no evidence and little chance the PLARF (or whatever it&#39;s called now) have achieved technical parity with US ICBMs. Besides, the US probably has more Minuteman IIIs than China has nuclear warheads in total (~400 v. ~300, respectively).  </p>\n\n<p>Most importantly, the OP article completely distorts the US position by conflating the existence of an acquisitions project with a decision to then subsequently forward deploy the acquired weapons system. &quot;Escalatory move would forward-deploy long-range nuke missiles on Virginia-class attack subs to close a deterrence gap with China.&quot; Nowhere in any of the sources OP links (nor in the source I linked), and nowhere in reality, has the US considered actually forward deploying sub-launched cruise missiles equipped with tactical nuclear warheads to deter China (as opposed to merely developing the capability to expand deterrence options during a crisis).

But there are other articles if you prefer. I can't even see what sources you provided earlier since your comment got removed. Probably for low quality again, huh Moses? Some things never change no matter what sub you're in. Hope you won't need to create another account again eventually.\n\n>What many Americans don\u2019t realize is that years of classified Pentagon war games strongly suggest that the U.S. military would lose that war.\n\n>\u201cMore than a decade ago, our war games indicated that the Chinese were doing a good job of investing in military capabilities that would make our preferred model of expeditionary warfare, where we push forces forward and operate out of relatively safe bases and sanctuaries, increasingly difficult,\u201d Air Force Lt. Gen. S. Clinton Hinote, deputy chief of staff for strategy, integration and requirements, told Yahoo News in an exclusive interview. By 2018, the People\u2019s Liberation Army had fielded many of those forces in large numbers, to include massive arsenals of precision-guided surface-to-air and surface-to-surface missiles, a space-based constellation of navigation and targeting satellites and the largest navy in the world.\n\n>\u201cAt that point the trend in our war games was not just that we were losing, but we were losing faster,\u201d Hinote said. \u201cAfter the 2018 war game I distinctly remember one of our gurus of war gaming standing in front of the Air Force secretary and chief of staff, and telling them that we should never play this war game scenario [of a Chinese attack on Taiwan] again, because we know what is going to happen. The definitive answer if the U.S. military doesn\u2019t change course is that we\u2019re going to lose fast. In that case, an American president would likely be presented with almost a fait accompli.\u201d\n\nSo to make things clear, Air Force Lt. Gen. S. Clinton Hinote, deputy chief of staff for strategy, integration and requirements, said that in their **years of classified war games**, they weren't just losing, they were losing faster. It was so bad that one of their \"war gaming gurus\" wanted to stop doing those wargames altogether because they kept losing. You can't just disregard this because you dislike the source. That's a pretty damning thing to say.\n\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/the-us-apparently-gets-its-ass-handed-to-it-in-war-games-2019-3?international=true&r=US&IR=T\n\nhttps://www.popularmechanics.com/military/a37158827/us-military-failed-miserably-in-taiwan-invasion-wargame/\n\nhttps://www.defenseone.com/policy/2021/07/it-failed-miserably-after-wargaming-loss-joint-chiefs-are-overhauling-how-us-military-will-fight/184050/\n\nUnsurprisingly you continue to put words into my mouth, right after I criticized you for putting words into my mouth. Why are you so insistent on telling me what I think? Wargames aren't irrelevant, I'm sure they have their purposes, otherwise they wouldn't be doing them. My point is that wargames show different results becaused they tend to be highly politicized and give one side disadvantages, sometimes their own side to expose weaknesses or to signal to their allies how important their participation would be in a conflict.\n\nIf war actually broke out, it could turn out completely different from any wargame ever done. It's good that you're so certain that China would easily be defeated though. I guess there's no point even talking about it then, we already know that China would lose hard and we can live happily forever. Not sure why China is even still building more ships. Did they not see the CSIS wargames? Face it, the only reason you put so much faith in these particular CSIS wargames is because they tell you what you want to believe.\n\nBtw, why would you say that the US and allies would easily win against China when the CSIS itself says that the defense of Taiwan came at a heavy cost and the US and its allies lost dozens of ships, hundreds of aircraft, and tens of thousands of servicemembers?

Some things never change no matter what sub you&#39;re in. Hope you won&#39;t need to create another account again eventually.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>What many Americans don\u2019t realize is that years of classified Pentagon war games strongly suggest that the U.S. military would lose that war.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMore than a decade ago, our war games indicated that the Chinese were doing a good job of investing in military capabilities that would make our preferred model of expeditionary warfare, where we push forces forward and operate out of relatively safe bases and sanctuaries, increasingly difficult,\u201d Air Force Lt. Gen. S. Clinton Hinote, deputy chief of staff for strategy, integration and requirements, told Yahoo News in an exclusive interview. By 2018, the People\u2019s Liberation Army had fielded many of those forces in large numbers, to include massive arsenals of precision-guided surface-to-air and surface-to-surface missiles, a space-based constellation of navigation and targeting satellites and the largest navy in the world.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAt that point the trend in our war games was not just that we were losing, but we were losing faster,\u201d Hinote said. \u201cAfter the 2018 war game I distinctly remember one of our gurus of war gaming standing in front of the Air Force secretary and chief of staff, and telling them that we should never play this war game scenario [of a Chinese attack on Taiwan] again, because we know what is going to happen. The definitive answer if the U.S. military doesn\u2019t change course is that we\u2019re going to lose fast. In that case, an American president would likely be presented with almost a fait accompli.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So to make things clear, Air Force Lt. Gen. S. Clinton Hinote, deputy chief of staff for strategy, integration and requirements, said that in their <strong>years of classified war games</strong>, they weren&#39;t just losing, they were losing faster. It was so bad that one of their &quot;war gaming gurus&quot; wanted to stop doing those wargames altogether because they kept losing. You can&#39;t just disregard this because you dislike the source. That&#39;s a pretty damning thing to say.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/the-us-apparently-gets-its-ass-handed-to-it-in-war-games-2019-3?international=true&amp;r=US&amp;IR=T\">https://www.businessinsider.com/the-us-apparently-gets-its-ass-handed-to-it-in-war-games-2019-3?international=true&amp;r=US&amp;IR=T</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/a37158827/us-military-failed-miserably-in-taiwan-invasion-wargame/\">https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/a37158827/us-military-failed-miserably-in-taiwan-invasion-wargame/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2021/07/it-failed-miserably-after-wargaming-loss-joint-chiefs-are-overhauling-how-us-military-will-fight/184050/\">https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2021/07/it-failed-miserably-after-wargaming-loss-joint-chiefs-are-overhauling-how-us-military-will-fight/184050/</a></p>\n\n<p>Unsurprisingly you continue to put words into my mouth, right after I criticized you for putting words into my mouth. Why are you so insistent on telling me what I think? Wargames aren&#39;t irrelevant, I&#39;m sure they have their purposes, otherwise they wouldn&#39;t be doing them. My point is that wargames show different results becaused they tend to be highly politicized and give one side disadvantages, sometimes their own side to expose weaknesses or to signal to their allies how important their participation would be in a conflict.</p>\n\n<p>If war actually broke out, it could turn out completely different from any wargame ever done. It&#39;s good that you&#39;re so certain that China would easily be defeated though. I guess there&#39;s no point even talking about it then, we already know that China would lose hard and we can live happily forever. Not sure why China is even still building more ships. Did they not see the CSIS wargames? Face it, the only reason you put so much faith in these particular CSIS wargames is because they tell you what you want to believe.</p>\n\n<p>Btw, why would you say that the US and allies would easily win against China when the CSIS itself says that the defense of Taiwan came at a heavy cost and the US and its allies lost dozens of ships, hundreds of aircraft, and tens of thousands of servicemembers?

Just like that, one of the foremost experts on the PLA is no longer credible to Moses. 20 years of working as a research professor at the US Naval War College? Pfft, get him out of here. It's almost as if it's not about being experts but it's about what you agree with. It's pretty obvious by now. This one CSIS report is the holy grail, but every other wargame or expert is not credible.\n\nChinese state astroturfing happens almost entirely on Chinese social media, not reddit. It's the opinions of Chinese people the CCP cares about. With like a billion internet users, they have enough on their plate.\n\nWhat's your source that he's funded by the Koch brothers, and how come you have issues with that, but not where CSIS gets its funding from?

I don't see 2 carriers, dozens of ships, hundreds of aircraft, and tens of thousands of casualties as \"easy\". 3-10 days is impressive though. If it happens in early December, we should name it the Home By Christmas War.\n\nAt least try to respond to my points. Don't give me a repeat of your bullet points.

This does not equate to me being an accomplice of the Chinese propaganda machine. Suggesting I am is just a foul way of interacting with redditors and has no place here.\n\nMy point is that one single source, the CSIS report you base your opinion of, has direct monetary ties to American defense industries, which is around a third of their budget.

Some folk focus more on a future war with China, where each missile donated to Ukraine is one less missile the US can fling at China. Each dollar given to Ukraine is a dollar that isn't spent on a multitude of other endeavours, from infrastructure to child-care subsidies. Some folk have principled objections to getting involved in foreign wars, and others just want to see Biden fail. If you need all these folk to agree to aid for Ukraine, you're going to need to compromise, so you're going to end up with less aid than you wanted, which is partially why the US is always playing catch-up with Ukraine's needs. \n\nYou aren't wrong about the US's priority being Ukrainian survival rather than Ukrainian absolute victory though, and there's two good reasons for that:  \n\nFirst, is the fear of escalation if Russia starts losing. You'll note that the moments when Russian rhetoric is most shrill, that maybe they should use WMDs or start bombing ammo dumps in Poland, was when the Russian front around Kharkiv collapsed. \n\nSecond, is the fear that a humiliating loss in Ukraine would lead to Putin's administration losing a grip on power and chaos taking hold in Russia. Chaos in a country with 4,000+ nuclear warheads is to be avoided at almost any costs, and one of those costs the US is willing to pay is the suffering of Ukraine.\n\nSo the US is dancing on a knife edge, they doesn't want Ukraine to lose, but they also don't them to win too hard either. A gradual managed loss for Russia, where they have time to save face by negotiating their continued ownership of Crimea and perhaps the Donbas, seems to be the sweet spot the US is aiming for.
