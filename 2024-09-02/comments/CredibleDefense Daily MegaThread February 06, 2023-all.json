They have domestic manufacturing and allied support for shells, missiles, UAV's, small arms and even to some extent artillery and tanks.\n\nSure, Russian will become less and less mechanized as time goes by, but the attrition we're witnessing it just not enough to severely limit their artillery of AA. They still have thousands of tanks, Artillery pieces, APC's and IFV's to send through the refurbishing process, even if the end result is not state of the art modern weaponry.\n\nOf course, western aid could turn that calculus around, for instance the introduction of loitering munitions to Ukrainian forces, or F-16's with the right strike kits may increase the erosion of the Russian forces past sustainment.",

USSR air defense systems were, usually competent, but probably more important, they were many, as in nearing stupendous amounts (given it was planned against NATO, it was actually completely sane).

            "body": "I think on february 24th, the russian air force was flying into a very challenging situation. As the Ukranians were forewarned of the attack they could disperse/hide their anti aircraft systems, so the initial missile barrage missed. This would leave russian aircraft needing to do the cat-and-mouse game of Suppression of Emeny Air Defence (SEAD).\nHow it normally works is this: The AA systems can't see enemy planes unless they turn their radar on, and enemy planes can't see the AA unless the AA turns their radar on. It's kind of like 2 men in a field at night trying to kill each other, both with handguns, one has a flashlight. The one with the flashlight can turn it on, and see what the flashlight is pointed at, but then the other man can see the flashlight from ANYWHERE in the field.\nOnly problem, that isn't the situation the Russians were facing. NATO AWACS planes (essentially huges radar on a plane) were flying up and down the border, monitering Russian aircraft and (probably, haven't seen this confirmed) reporting their position to the Ukranians. The Russians always knew NATO had these, and had developed very long range missiles to deal with them in the event of WW3, but as NATO was neutral, couldn't fire on them without bringing a world of pain down on them. So Ukrainians never needed to turn their radars on to find out where the russians were, they could just get updates from AWACS, turn on the radar briefly to get a firing solution, fire, then scoot. It's like the man with the flashlight also has a third man at the edge of the field with night vision goggles, calling out to flashlight man where the other man is, and the other man isn't allowed to do anything about it!\nWhile the Russian air force has clearly struggled, I think most air forces would struggle with that set of mission parameters (unless you have stealth fighters, of course)",
            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I think on february 24th, the russian air force was flying into a very challenging situation. As the Ukranians were forewarned of the attack they could disperse/hide their anti aircraft systems, so the initial missile barrage missed. This would leave russian aircraft needing to do the cat-and-mouse game of Suppression of Emeny Air Defence (SEAD).\nHow it normally works is this: The AA systems can&#39;t see enemy planes unless they turn their radar on, and enemy planes can&#39;t see the AA unless the AA turns their radar on. It&#39;s kind of like 2 men in a field at night trying to kill each other, both with handguns, one has a flashlight. The one with the flashlight can turn it on, and see what the flashlight is pointed at, but then the other man can see the flashlight from ANYWHERE in the field.\nOnly problem, that isn&#39;t the situation the Russians were facing. NATO AWACS planes (essentially huges radar on a plane) were flying up and down the border, monitering Russian aircraft and (probably, haven&#39;t seen this confirmed) reporting their position to the Ukranians.

To stick and move, ambushing and counterattacking at every opportunity while Russia strings itself out, overextending itself not because they are depleted of manpower at the strategic level but at the tactical and operational level, because their doctrine and present state wont allow them to move rapidly and remain organized outside of positional warfare. But that's out of the question, for whatever reason Ukraine will not voluntarily give up ground unless its untenable, so that means any defensive strategy they have will be \"hold at all cost\" for the entire forward line of troops. \n\nWhich means if Ukraine were to try to \"exhaust\" Russian offensive capabilities its going to take a walloping itself, just like it always has. To start out, its going to be playing to Russian strengths, who would flop trying to fight a legit campaign of maneuver at this point but can better manage all of their weaknesses and strengths by performing highly centralized and choreographed set piece battles where they control the time, location, pace, etc; IE when they hold the initiative. \n\nWhich means for Ukraine to exhaust Russian artillery, they have to eat that artillery, get hit with it. To exhaust Russian manpower means waiting for them to attack and hoping to stack them up, sometimes or most of times the Russians failing with heavy casualties but sometimes they'll succeed too creating tactical and operational level emergencies for the Ukrainians. Plus, Russia has reverted to an extremely ruthless WW2-esque \"playbook\" often using its lesser quality troops to conduct most of their attacks, especially those without a high chance of succeeding, so Ukraine isn't going to be causing heavy attrition of Russia's better troops, whereas to have any hope of holding territory Ukraine has to use high quality troops. So the trade-off will favor Russia. \n\nWhen not on the attack, where does Russia tend to place its better troops, like the VDV? Strategically and operationally important defensive sectors where the Ukrainians are attacking in force. Where does it stack artillery systems en-masse, vulnerable to UAF fires? Strategically and operationally important defensive sectors where the Ukrainians are attacking in force. Where does it prioritize massive stockpiles of supplies, making them vulnerable to HIMARS GMLRS/GLSDB? Strategically and operationally important defensive sectors where the Ukrainians are attacking in force. \n\nI think a strategy of attrition is a bad idea, its risky to attempt at the best of times but it's incredibly foolish after Russian mobilizes and especially if Ukraine and its allies aren't okay with this war dragging on for another decade.

That meant that the Svatove-Kreminna offensive was basically a hasty operation, created on the fly. \n\nLogistically, the UAF has not been doing great logistically in this war, definitely never really having a glut. However, they would have stockpiled quite a bit through July-August in anticipation of the \"Great Summer Offensive,\" especially ammunition, as they initially intended to liberate the entire South (Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts) but switched to Kherson bridgehead (HUGELY costly in arty and HIMARS GMLRS) and the Kharkiv offensive (still very heavy in fires, primary example being tactical use of HIMARS for the breach/breakthrough). The Kherson offensive ended up going on until mid Nov and it seems that was a harder battle than they anticipated (especially considering how many times they needed to continously go after the bridges/pontoons with HIMARS). The Kharkiv operation, the lesser of the two in terms of overall strategic importance, ended quickly but rolled right into the three month long Svatove-Kreminna offensive, so there is no way in hell they logistically planned for it.   \n\nAlso, I'm betting that the UAF committed most of their fall-winter manpower replacements to the Svatove-Kreminna offensive too. Individually replacements from domestic and NATO individual \"basic\" training were probably used to reconstitute units finished with the Kherson offensive (many of which have since ended up in Bakhmut), while others were apparently directly fed into the units actively fighting in Donbas (it was reported in Soledar that the UAF was using direct individual replacement while units were on the front lines). Plus, a sizeable chunk of their strategic reserve were likely used to conduct the mid to late December (a bunch of new units arrived to relieve others), plus needing to reconstitute the units leaving to go into the strategic rear. And despite all that, the UAF still need to start stockpiling manpower and quality units, as well as ammunition for its spring-summer offensive, along with the threat of repelling a Russian offensive coming first, which means they either create two strategic reserves (one meant to repel the Russian offensive and other for their own offensive), or else a single strategic offensive that needs to do both. \n\nSo with shitty weather, no real plan, a lack of ammunition, manpower and supply drains especially in Bakhmut, there was little chance they were going to make progress against a heavily defended sector filled with not only lots of Mobik rebuilt units but also VDV.

What was their main effort? Which areas were the supporting effort? If one bases that what they did and what they did it with, and not on what the media or ISW was reporting, its actually pretty hard to choose. \n\nIMO, what Ukraine need to do is create a strategy that's based on political goals, then create an operation to support their strategy, and then commit most of what they have to achieve that, while exercising economy of force elsewhere, even if that means temporarily losing ground (its not that big of a deal, especially when they're losing it anyway while doing everything they can to hold it). \n\nThe second problem is a mix of lack of skill from prewar or lack of skill from postwar. Its mostly about issues relating to battalion and brigade level combined arms cooperation, integration, and knowledge by battalion and under on how to execute it. The Ukrainians understand how to do it, they demonstrated in places like Kherson and Kharkiv, the former they managed to punch through some Russian locations despite them doing everything they could to hold them, and the breakthrough during the Kharkiv offensive was absolutely a breaching operation (though against a less-than-capable opponent). \n\nWhat I worry about is Ukraine squandering a lot of its best and brightest, plus more equipment, doing fruitless operations that don't actually lead to any strategic goal besides \"Kill orcs,\" further hindering their abilities to conduct combined arms breaching operations. \n\nMaybe that will be something NATO can help with. Giving them 3rd Gen MBTs and IFVs will increase the odds of success if they do everything else right, but they the brigades and higher of veteran units, filled with competent veterans who are already the best the UAF has in offensive operations, to be run through a 1-2 month long brigade level training package where all they do is train on the combined arms breach, with lots of live fire and force on force.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Economy of Force means \"employing all available combat power in the most effective way possible, in an attempt to allocate a minimum of essential combat power to any secondary efforts.\"",

This way they don't have to look at a screen, and picture in their mind where what they are seeing is in relation to the tank, which is difficult to keep track of. They will know immediately which way to turn the turret to look at stuff, and even if they don't the lights will let them have some basic situational awareness.\n\nThe system could have very simple categories. If the drone operator sees a friendly, they mark them blue. If they see a potential enemy, they mark it yellow, and if they see a definite enemy they mark it red, which also might make a little quiet ping (but not every time, you don't want to overwhelm the tankers with too much feedback). The drone itself should also have a light showing the compass direction to it at all times, so people in the tank who aren't watching all the time can quickly reorient themselves back to the feed's relative location.",

This way they don&#39;t have to look at a screen, and picture in their mind where what they are seeing is in relation to the tank, which is difficult to keep track of. They will know immediately which way to turn the turret to look at stuff, and even if they don&#39;t the lights will let them have some basic situational awareness.</p>\n\n<p>The system could have very simple categories. If the drone operator sees a friendly, they mark them blue. If they see a potential enemy, they mark it yellow, and if they see a definite enemy they mark it red, which also might make a little quiet ping (but not every time, you don&#39;t want to overwhelm the tankers with too much feedback). The drone itself should also have a light showing the compass direction to it at all times, so people in the tank who aren&#39;t watching all the time can quickly reorient themselves back to the feed&#39;s relative location.</p>\n</div>",

And that is not only combat arms MOS but all support personnel too, who are extensive. Together, this cadre would amount to about 1/3 of all personnel in the unit (they need to come from existing units who \"volunteer\" to give up their best and brightest), with the other 2/3 being the junior enlisted and junior officers coming directly from initial training or MOS school to the units (if they have to get MOS specific individual training with their unit that only delays the onset of unit training).   \n\nFinding the bodies can be tough. Especially the 1/3 cadre needed to create all those new units, which can destroy cohesion and combat effectiveness in the units who lose them (same as being hurt very badly in combat, 1/3 loss almost overnight). Contrarily, its not uncommon for veteran units to get an order to submit cadre and to send their worst instead of their best, to use the opportunity to unload the lower tier shitbird officers and soldiers, to get rid of them and make them another unit's problem. \n\nThe new junior enlisted and officers will be tough too, even with NATO helping with initial training its still pretty low, especially for specialist training for support MOS. I bet money their biggest limitation is newly commissioned officers, who in the Ukraine Armed Forces have a major role due to a lack of NCO corps. \n\nEquipment: Not only do they need equipment for infantry such as APC/IFV, as well as tanks and artillery too, but also air defense, engineering, maintenance, logistics, signals, electronic warfare, drone, and medical. \n\nIn terms of equipment (and supplies for that matter), if they are forming them, they likely already have everything or know for a fact they'll have it by the time the units . Unless this reporting is intentionally false, part of a deception plan, they have what is needed to create a minimum of four new mechanized brigades, which means not only IFV, tanks, and self propelled guns, but everything else too. \n\nSomething else to consider is that each additional combat unit places additional logistical burdens on the UAF. It would in fact be easier to feed replacement manpower, equipment, and supplies to existing units to keep them as close to 100% as possible.

They'll need to do that in rural field works, forests, urban areas, and against rivers. Day and night. Part of this requires building it all themselves.\n\n- Perform hasty and prepared combined arms attack against Russian defenses in rural field works, forests, urban areas, and across rivers. At a minimum during the day but should also know how to do it at night, even without night vision equipment for everyone (not a prerequisite). \n\n- Perform retrograde operations. Withdrawal/retreat, delay, retirement, but especially retreat, since that actually is something Ukrainian units have repeatedly done and isn't something any unit should try to figure out when it matters. They'll need to do that day and night. \n\nTo accomplish each of these requires a gigantic list of individual skills by every individual in the brigade, in every job and rank. After learning their individual tasks (for instance, there are like a dozen skills + needed to operate a medium machine gun), then they have to apply them to unit level collective tasks (using that machine gun for something specific with a unit). \n\nFor example, a hasty squad attack (daylight) requires something like a hundred individual skills and scores of collective tasks. To conduct a brigade level combined arms attack requires a book just to list the skills but not describe how to perform them (that fills up a dozen footlockers with manuals). To succeed requires enough key individuals in the brigade to do their parts while also coordinating with each other, which requires every chain down to company at a minimum working with another arm to know not only their own branch but also whatever else necessary to do combined arms separately.\n\nFor instance, for mechanized infantry to do combined arms they need to know doctrine, strengths, weaknesses, and various techniques, tactics, and procedures relating to whatever other branch they're working with. So for tanks that means knowing what the main gun can do to various types of targets, and how do I give falls for fire. Or knowing what a tank can see, what can't it see, which is hugely important. Or what it can't drive over or through. Working with artillery is even more complicated. And at a minimum the platoon leader should know all of those and more, but squad leaders should too. Plus knowing comms, toss in drones too since they're used with infantry ops on the regular. And you're not just learning how to use combined arms, you need to know how to defeat combined arms because the enemy will probably be using it too. \n\nBut what happens when only company or just  battalion commanders know combined arms, who are experienced and knowledgeable enough to have been trained well in not only their arm but also other arms too? Because that's what is happening to both the Russians and Ukrainians, they are suffering shortages of trained and experienced officers and enlisted troops who know how to work with other branches to perform combined arms.\n\nThe only way to fix that is training or experience, where \"veterans,\" aka survivors, often are forced to learn while the overall casualties aren't too high that the knowledgeable veteran survivors are in high enough numbers to accomplish impressive deeds. That would describe many veteran Ukrainian units who were mediocre before the war but learned from experience, never having been hurt so badly with casualties or other personnel losses that prevented them from collectively knowing what they're doing (assuming they never do anything new, at which point they're clueless again). \n\nThat's also the danger of UAF General Staff allowing quality units to be essentially destroyed in meat grinder battles and why I always rant against that happening. Ukraine has not and still does not have a pipeline to replace those losses and thus should not be wasting resources they will need in the immediate future, they're literally more important than ground.",

Kyiv has strategic importance because it's the seat of govt, Odessa because it's a chief port, etc. \n\nWith regards to attrition, depending on what was lost or expended trying to take or hold Bakhmut, one of the sides might have exhausted itself to a degree they won't be able to achieve anything dramatic in the near term, and if that's true they suffered strategically.\n\nBakhmut has gained a lot of political importance because both sides put a lot to take/hold it, the battle attracted lots of attention from western media during an otherwise boring winter (*if it bleeds, it leads* is how journalism works), the Ukrainian govt talked it up a lot to the press increasing the stakes, and because the Russians so desperately want a victory. Losing Bakhmut would be quite politically costly for Ukraine. Though the loss could actually prompt more Western aid, because that's just how proxy wars work. Losses often goose the patrons to give more. \n\nWhether either side intended it or not, Bakhmut became the strategic main effort of both during the winter after they eat put so much effort into their respective campaign.\n\nOperationally, in terms of the overall Russian campaign to take the Donbas and the Ukrainian effort to stop it, Bakhmut is a middling sized city that acts as a junction to numerous important roads, one of which leads to Sloviansk, the chief Ukrainian held city of Donetsk oblast and one of the last couple \"stronghold\" cities in the oblast. if the Russians can take Bakhmut and immediate area they're getting that much closer to their operational objective to take Donetsk oblast (though it'll still take a bit to retake what they lost in Luhansk oblast). \n\nTactically, in terms of winning battles, Bakhmut's location in the front line ties it in with Siversk to its immediate north, so it protects its flank. Losing Bakhmut increases the likelihood of losing Siversk, as it can be attacked by multiple directions.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Strategically, it&#39;s not really militarily important, as in keeping or losing it doesn&#39;t affect the outcome of the war, notwithstanding other reasons such as attrition or political. Kyiv has strategic importance because it&#39;s the seat of govt, Odessa because it&#39;s a chief port, etc. </p>\n\n<p>With regards to attrition, depending on what was lost or expended trying to take or hold Bakhmut, one of the sides might have exhausted itself to a degree they won&#39;t be able to achieve anything dramatic in the near term, and if that&#39;s true they suffered strategically.</p>\n\n<p>Bakhmut has gained a lot of political importance because both sides put a lot to take/hold it, the battle attracted lots of attention from western media during an otherwise boring winter (<em>if it bleeds, it leads</em> is how journalism works), the Ukrainian govt talked it up a lot to the press increasing the stakes, and because the Russians so desperately want a victory. Losing Bakhmut would be quite politically costly for Ukraine. Though the loss could actually prompt more Western aid, because that&#39;s just how proxy wars work. Losses often goose the patrons to give more. </p>\n\n<p>Whether either side intended it or not, Bakhmut became the strategic main effort of both during the winter after they eat put so much effort into their respective campaign.</p>\n\n<p>Operationally, in terms of the overall Russian campaign to take the Donbas and the Ukrainian effort to stop it, Bakhmut is a middling sized city that acts as a junction to numerous important roads, one of which leads to Sloviansk, the chief Ukrainian held city of Donetsk oblast and one of the last couple &quot;stronghold&quot; cities in the oblast. if the Russians can take Bakhmut and immediate area they&#39;re getting that much closer to their operational objective to take Donetsk oblast (though it&#39;ll still take a bit to retake what they lost in Luhansk oblast). </p>\n\n<p>Tactically, in terms of winning battles, Bakhmut&#39;s location in the front line ties it in with Siversk to its immediate north, so it protects its flank. Losing Bakhmut increases the likelihood of losing Siversk, as it can be attacked by multiple directions. Additionally, losing Bakhmut moves the Donbas front lines to the high ground east of Sloviansk-Kramatorsk-Kostyantynivka, that much closer and puts those cities in range of most Russian artillery.</p>\n</div>",
