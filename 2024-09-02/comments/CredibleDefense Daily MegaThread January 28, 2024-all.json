                "body": "I think it was only a matter of time before this happened. I can't imagine having hegemony over these territories is really that rewarding for France anyway. The three countries are all [relatively rich in natural resources](https://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/opendocs/bitstream/handle/20.500.12413/14277/453_Natural_Resources_Management_Strategies_in_the_Sahel.pdf?sequence=90&isAllowed=y):\n\n\\>Gold is Mali\u2019s leading extractive industry, representing 95% of its mineral production (Antil, 2014,p. 10). Mali is Africa\u2019s third-largest gold producer and in 2013, gold accounted for over two-thirds of the country\u2019s total export revenues\n\n\\>Niger is the world\u2019s fourth largest producer of uranium and exported over EUR 348 million in 2010\n\n\\>In 2009, gold overtook cotton as Burkina Faso\u2019s main export and the country became the continent\u2019s fourth biggest producer (Antil, 2014, p. 14). By 2010, 300 mining prospects had been issued and 60 international firms were engaged in mining exploration and exploitation\n\nit seems protecting such resources may have been part of France's [original operation in 2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Barkhane)  to stop Islamists around the area as is indicated by [this paper](https://www.e-ir.info/pdf/88270):\n\n\\> branding French intervention as neo-colonial could be crude and reductionist given the complex nature of international trade itself. However, the prolonged presence of French soldiers has symbolic connotations in international relations and may give a heuristic for erecting some sort of a dependency framework. Although it may appear secondary to the analysis of this military intervention, on the strategic level it may give broader insights on the long-term presence of the French in the region.

                "body": ">Is this a way for the Biden administration to bypass the Congress for the time being?\n\nNo to the question you wrote, but maybe for the question you're asking.\n\nNo, Biden isn't bypassing Congress. It has to be notified of EDA sales or grants, which then can be held up. The other thing is EDA is a \"where is, as is\" program. The receiving country has to pay to ship it and refurbish anything that needs refurbished. Now, must countries also receive Foreign Military Financing grants or loans for those costs. FMF funds are allocated, and disbursement approved, by Congress. Greece got $30m last year and this year, so Congress approved that as well.\n\nThe \"maybe\" is that the real question you're asking is if Biden can use that process to give allies US equipment with the understanding that they'll send COMBLOC equipment to Ukraine. That's likely the idea, but not likely to have a formal agreement; more of a handshake. And it depends on the specifics of what is available in equipment and funding to be granted from the US to fill the gaps of the receiving country, as well as timelines and probably dozens of different things. So it all depends. \n\nI definitely think that's a strategy they're pursuing regardless, though. Romania, for instance, wanted to purchase 54 Abrams, [approving $1.1bn to do it](https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2023/05/17/romanian-lawmakers-vote-to-approve-11-billion-abrams-acquisition/). However, the notification to Congress was for $2.53bn, which caused the Romanian Legislature to remind the Administration that they only approved $1.1. After some finessing, [they got it down to $1.07bn](https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2023/05/17/romanian-lawmakers-vote-to-approve-11-billion-abrams-acquisition/). Why is that important? Because Romania still has a significant amount of COMBLOC equipment, some of which might be able to be freed up if they know 54 Abrams are coming in a few years. But who knows if that's the actual case.",

In itself, Tabaivka has no tactical relevance, what matters are the heights just to the west, which are the watershed between the Oskil and the Pischana. Heights that I expect have been fortified by the Ukrainians in order to be defended against Russian attacks, which once they take part of the Pischana valley, are going to have an altitude disadvantage if they continue to attack westwards. They are also attacking in the direction of Berestove, a few kilometers to the south. \n\nThe Russians are also attacking towards Kotlyarivka and Kyslivka, further north. These two settlements, on the other hand, are tactically important, although the Ukrainians seem to be defending them well at the moment. Losing them would give the Russians access to the high ground north of the Pischana valley and could jeopardize Ukrainian positions further north near Ivanivka, which the Ukrainians have been defending excellently for months against Russian attacks from Orlianka and Yahidne. It's clear that the Russians want to put pressure in this section of the front to aim at approaching Kupyansk and the Oskil from this direction, and it seems that the bulk of the 47th Tank Division of the 1st GTA, which has received reinforcements and new units in recent months, is committed in the operation. In any case, from this to say that Kupyansk may be directly threatened would be an overstatement in my opinion - the \"journey\" will be a long one for the Russians.\n\nIt's worth noting what DeepState wrote at the end, which confirms what I have been reading for more than a week about the fact there are serious communication problems going on between units in the Kupyansk sector (particularly in that section), with units often not admitting the loss of positions, with the only result being to get neighboring units into trouble. This at the \"micro\" level can happen due to squads losing or leaving positions without alerting neighboring squads of the same unit, and at the \"macro\" level when officers don't notify other brigades of front line changes, perhaps out of fear of being judged negatively or confident that their unit will be able to regain what was lost with a counterattack (which is often another cause of problems). Specifically, the Tabaivka/Krokhmalne area is covered by the 103rd TDF Brigade and there seems to have been problems within this unit. It's possible that Ukrainian reinforcements are stabilizing the situation, for example near Berestove the 25th Airborne Brigade should be active, while Russian sources report the presence of the 44th Mechanized Brigade around Tabaivka - we will see whether or not this will find confirmation in the facts.",

This could easily spiral into a regional war, with Israel only being capable of *slowing* Iran's approach to the bomb, not stopping it entirely, and then we have two nuclear powers facing off.\n\n- Saudi Arabia's monarchy is backed by two things, the oil revenue with which it bribes its populace into passivity, and US military backing. The US leaving doesn't just leave the KSA looking vulnerable militarily (see its dismal performance in Yemen), it also risks its oil sales. Remember those Iranian proxy drone strikes against Saudi oil facilities a few years ago? Then look at the Houthis current efforts, and imagine Iran redirecting those efforts to hitting oil tankers leaving KSA.

I'm not going to be able to do all these points you raise justice, but just a few notes I wanted to add.\n\n> attempting rapprochement with Iran\n\nIt's important to remember than Iran is not a monolith. Iran is really two governments wrapped up in a cloak, pretending to be one. Think of it like if the US has a President for life from one political party, who had the support of a corrupt military and cared primarily about maintaining their cushy positions, whereas congress is of the other political party, and being elected representatives, they somewhat care about how sanctions hurt ordinary people and so prefer better relations with the West.\n\nRapprochement is about strengthening the faction that wants improved relations with the West, showing it's a viable option that's popular, whereas the hardliners want to convince the populace that the West are their enemy.\n\nThe massive protests/riots that occurred in ~2010 as part of the Green Movement scared the old regime hardliners enough that they allowed congress to take the lead, which is why we got the nuclear deal during Obama's tenure. But the hardliners were itching to seize the imitative again, and the US reneging on the deal was the perfect excuse for them to say rapprochement was useless. Subsequent protests have been put down far more ruthlessly by the regime, so unfortunately I'm not sure if we'll see another 2010 style change in Iran, but it's not hopeless, so that's why I still hold out hope for another deal.\n\n> the Houthis ... [There's serious questions about why we ever stopped designating them as such]\n\nThis is uncannily like the dilemma when Hamas was voted into power in Gaza. Do you continue to shun them as a terrorist organisation and therefore cut all aid to Gaza and so risk a humanitarian disaster, or do you engage with them and hope they moderate with the compromises necessary to rule a country? Shunning the Houthis risks driving them further into the arms of those who will support them, i.e. Iran.\n\nClearly this didn't turn out well for the West with Hamas or the Houthis, but I'm not sure the alternative would have been that much better either, and perhaps it was worth the gamble even if we lost in this case.",

Think of it like if the US has a President for life from one political party, who had the support of a corrupt military and cared primarily about maintaining their cushy positions, whereas congress is of the other political party, and being elected representatives, they somewhat care about how sanctions hurt ordinary people and so prefer better relations with the West.</p>\n\n<p>Rapprochement is about strengthening the faction that wants improved relations with the West, showing it&#39;s a viable option that&#39;s popular, whereas the hardliners want to convince the populace that the West are their enemy.</p>\n\n<p>The massive protests/riots that occurred in ~2010 as part of the Green Movement scared the old regime hardliners enough that they allowed congress to take the lead, which is why we got the nuclear deal during Obama&#39;s tenure. But the hardliners were itching to seize the imitative again, and the US reneging on the deal was the perfect excuse for them to say rapprochement was useless. Subsequent protests have been put down far more ruthlessly by the regime, so unfortunately I&#39;m not sure if we&#39;ll see another 2010 style change in Iran, but it&#39;s not hopeless, so that&#39;s why I still hold out hope for another deal.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>the Houthis ... [There&#39;s serious questions about why we ever stopped designating them as such]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is uncannily like the dilemma when Hamas was voted into power in Gaza. Do you continue to shun them as a terrorist organisation and therefore cut all aid to Gaza and so risk a humanitarian disaster, or do you engage with them and hope they moderate with the compromises necessary to rule a country? Shunning the Houthis risks driving them further into the arms of those who will support them, i.e. Iran.</p>\n\n<p>Clearly this didn&#39;t turn out well for the West with Hamas or the Houthis, but I&#39;m not sure the alternative would have been that much better either, and perhaps it was worth the gamble even if we lost in this case.</p>\n</div>",

The only hard part is enriching the uranium to sufficiently high levels because it uses some specialised equipment, but which Iran already has the tools to do as proven by it enriching uranium just short of weapons-grade. The final step doesn't take any additional equipment, you literally use the exact same tool you just used to get the uranium to the moderately enriched state, you just run the uranium through the centrifuges a few more times and you get weapons-grade uranium. Then to turn that uranium into a bomb, you require the same level of tech as required to make a simple mouse-trap. A simple switch that drops two halves of the uranium together, bringing it up to the critical mass to start an explosion. There is literally nothing stopping Iran from developing the bomb other than the decision to take that final step.",
