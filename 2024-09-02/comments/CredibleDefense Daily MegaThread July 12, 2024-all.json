        "body": "Another possible future addition to the U.S. drone fleet will be flying soon.  With the war in Ukraine showing how important loitering surveillance behind enemy lines has become it makes sense to have undetectable drones that can loiter for a long time.  \n\n[Our Best Look Yet At The XRQ-73 Hybrid-Electric Stealthy Flying Wing Drone | The Warzone | July 2024](https://www.twz.com/air/our-best-look-yet-at-the-xrq-73-hybrid-electric-stealthy-flying-wing-drone)\n\n*Northrop Grumman has provided the first definitive photo of its Series Hybrid Electric Propulsion AiRcraft Demonstration (SHEPARD) drone, also known as XRQ-73. The image gives us a much better look at the flying wing vehicle, which is built in collaboration with the company\u2019s subsidiary Scaled Composites and DARPA, and features a breakthrough, highly efficient, and whisper-quiet hybrid-electric propulsion system.*\n\n*When the first image of the XRQ-73 was released, it was unclear if this was a rendering of the design or an actual photo overlaid on a computer-generated background, although we thought the latter was the case. The new photo confirms this and that the XRQ-73 airframe has been built.*\n\n*The XRQ-73 has a tailless flying wing planform, broadly similar to the Lockheed Martin Skunk Work\u2019s RQ-170 Sentinel, P-175 Polecat, and X-44A. You can read our basic analysis of the planform of the aircraft in our past report [here](https://www.twz.com/air/shadowy-xrq-73-hybrid-electric-stealthy-flying-wing-drone-emerges).*\n\n*Very prominent are the two relatively enormous air intakes on top of the central section of the fuselage. These inlets are located on either side of a central fairing, which itself has two rectangular apertures at the front which appear to be another set of intakes. It\u2019s not clear what these are for, but cooling for the hybrid powerplant and the aircraft\u2019s electronics is the top possibility. It could also provide additional clean airflow to the powerplant during takeoff and landing operations.*\n\n*Meanwhile, in the preceding XRQ-72A, two multi-sectioned inlets at the front of the fuselage fed air to two fuel-powered generators, which in turn provided electric power to four ducted fan propulsors mounted on top of the rear of the central fuselage. Those propulsors are not embedded in the fuselage itself, with a DARPA official previously mentioning they planned to \u201cwrap\u201d the concept in a more survivable, operationally relevant airframe.*\n\n*Another interesting feature of the XRQ-73 that was not visible in the previous rendering is a large, faceted fairing below the central section of the fuselage. This is very likely a sensor enclosure that can handle different kinds of electro-optical, radar, and passive radio-frequency payloads. This general arrangement also exists on the similarly-shaped RQ-170 Sentinel.*\n\n*While the photo released today shows the XRQ-73 parked in a hangar, its landing gear is partly obscured. Nevertheless, this is of the tricycle type with single wheels on the main units and a notably large three-piece door for the nose unit.*\n\n*Also new is the air data probe offset on the nose of the drone, a feature found on most aircraft during their test-flight phases. DARPA has said it hopes to flight test the XRQ-73 later this year, which would also correspond with the program\u2019s overarching ambition to leverage \u201chybrid electric architecture and component technologies to quickly mature a new mission-focused aircraft design,\u201d as Northrop Grumman states. The aim is to demonstrate that the XRQ-73 can be operationalized relatively quickly to meet an unspecified \u201curgent operational need.\u201d*\n\n*Based on the RQ-series designation, it\u2019s safe to assume that the drone is primarily intended for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), although other missions shouldn\u2019t be ruled out. A stealthy and very quiet drone of this kind would appear to be ideal for covert surveillance in denied areas, as well as missions requiring persistence at extended ranges. Somewhere below the RQ-170 and above smaller, catapult-launched designs such as the [Northrop Grumman\u2019s Bat](https://www.northropgrumman.com/what-we-do/air/bat-uas), is where such a system would most likely fit in the overall unmanned aerial system hierarchy.*\n\nThe article continues on giving more exact specs, but I've edited some paragraphs for space.\n\n*\u201cNo details about the XRQ-73\u2019s expected performance appear to have been released so far, but DARPA says it is a Group 3 uncrewed aerial system (UAS) weighing approximately 1,250 pounds, which will include \u201coperationally representative \u2026 mission systems.\u201d By the U.S. military\u2019s definitions, a Group 3 UAS weighs between 55 and 1,320, can fly at altitudes between 3,500 and 18,000 feet, and has a top speed of between 100 and 250 knots.*\n\n*At 1,250 pounds, the XRQ-73 is set to be substantially larger than the XRQ-72A, the requirements for which called for a drone weighing between 300 and 400 pounds. The XRQ-72A also had a 30-foot wingspan, a length of 11.2 feet measured from the nose to the ends of the wingtips, and a height of four feet when including the vertical wingtip stabilizers, according to [schematics The War Zone previously obtained](https://www.twz.com/32807/exclusive-unmasking-northrop-grummans-xrq-72a-great-horned-owl-spy-drone) via the Freedom of Information Act.*",

Somewhere below the RQ-170 and above smaller, catapult-launched designs such as the <a href=\"https://www.northropgrumman.com/what-we-do/air/bat-uas\">Northrop Grumman\u2019s Bat</a>, is where such a system would most likely fit in the overall unmanned aerial system hierarchy.</em></p>\n\n<p>The article continues on giving more exact specs, but I&#39;ve edited some paragraphs for space.</p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cNo details about the XRQ-73\u2019s expected performance appear to have been released so far, but DARPA says it is a Group 3 uncrewed aerial system (UAS) weighing approximately 1,250 pounds, which will include \u201coperationally representative \u2026 mission systems.\u201d By the U.S. military\u2019s definitions, a Group 3 UAS weighs between 55 and 1,320, can fly at altitudes between 3,500 and 18,000 feet, and has a top speed of between 100 and 250 knots.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>At 1,250 pounds, the XRQ-73 is set to be substantially larger than the XRQ-72A, the requirements for which called for a drone weighing between 300 and 400 pounds. The XRQ-72A also had a 30-foot wingspan, a length of 11.2 feet measured from the nose to the ends of the wingtips, and a height of four feet when including the vertical wingtip stabilizers, according to <a href=\"https://www.twz.com/32807/exclusive-unmasking-northrop-grummans-xrq-72a-great-horned-owl-spy-drone\">schematics The War Zone previously obtained</a> via the Freedom of Information Act.</em></p>\n</div>",

That didn\u2019t close the door to eventually lifting the restrictions, but it was still far from a \u201cyes,\u201d the people said.\n\n>Zelenskyy and ANDRIY YERMAK, his chief of staff, **were extremely disappointed after the conversation**, a person familiar with the matter said.\n\n>**\u201cThe feeling is always the same: They will lift restrictions eventually, but some people have to die first. It seems like destroying a children\u2019s hospital is not enough,\u201d said the person, who like others was granted anonymity to discuss the private meeting.**\n\n>Biden addressed how he responded to Zelenskyy during his high-profile news conference Thursday night: **\u201cIf he had the capacity to strike Moscow, strike the Kremlin, would that make sense? It wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Biden said**, *even though the U.S. has not transferred any weapons to Ukraine that put the Russian capital in range*.\n\nThe Ukrainians have got to be absolutely incensed about this whole thing. The entirety of Ukraine is a target for the Russians, but the Ukrainians must abide by targeting restrictions which provide effective safe zones within Russia. More and more, it feels like the NATO allies, particularly certain big players, are deterring themselves through self-imposed fears over escalation. The Ukrainians feel like they are being slow-walked on weapons and capabilities, which is extending the war and thus killing more people. This has been a consistent factor throughout the course of this war.\n\nSomething I want to point out: If the Ukrainians' conventional capabilities are restricted, they will eventually be forced to explore more asymmetrical means of warfare as we have seen in the past.These are often unpalatable to certain allies.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/national-security-daily/2024/07/12/a-palestinian-push-on-capitol-hill-during-nato-00167824\">President Biden rejected President Zelensky&#39;s request for authorization to strike strategic targets in Russia</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ukrainian leaders walked away frustrated after Biden waved off their latest request to lift restrictions on the use of U.S. weapons to strike inside Russia.</p>\n\n<p>Ukrainian President VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY brought up the issue toward the end of the bilateral discussion on Thursday as the NATO summit came to a close, leading Biden to say both sides should keep talking, according to three people familiar. That didn\u2019t close the door to eventually lifting the restrictions, but it was still far from a \u201cyes,\u201d the people said.</p>\n\n<p>Zelenskyy and ANDRIY YERMAK, his chief of staff, <strong>were extremely disappointed after the conversation</strong>, a person familiar with the matter said.</p>\n\n<p><strong>\u201cThe feeling is always the same: They will lift restrictions eventually, but some people have to die first. It seems like destroying a children\u2019s hospital is not enough,\u201d said the person, who like others was granted anonymity to discuss the private meeting.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Biden addressed how he responded to Zelenskyy during his high-profile news conference Thursday night: <strong>\u201cIf he had the capacity to strike Moscow, strike the Kremlin, would that make sense? It wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Biden said</strong>, <em>even though the U.S. has not transferred any weapons to Ukraine that put the Russian capital in range</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Ukrainians have got to be absolutely incensed about this whole thing. The entirety of Ukraine is a target for the Russians, but the Ukrainians must abide by targeting restrictions which provide effective safe zones within Russia. More and more, it feels like the NATO allies, particularly certain big players, are deterring themselves through self-imposed fears over escalation. The Ukrainians feel like they are being slow-walked on weapons and capabilities, which is extending the war and thus killing more people. This has been a consistent factor throughout the course of this war.</p>\n\n<p>Something I want to point out: If the Ukrainians&#39; conventional capabilities are restricted, they will eventually be forced to explore more asymmetrical means of warfare as we have seen in the past.These are often unpalatable to certain allies.

However, attitudes in those northernmost mountain towns were very supportive of the PKK, no doubt influenced by the very in-your-face Turkish presence and counter-insurgency operations against the PKK that would often directly affect folks in these towns.\n\nAs American forces, back then we were trying to walk a very thin line by not pissing either side off.  We tried to get the PKK to tone things down, but as you can imagine trying to convince a G-Force to lay low while we try to FID our way to victory is often a near impossible struggle.

They do this by containing the propellant burn and accelerate the payload quickly. This translate to you needing to ship much less propellants, dozens times less, to the gun. Rocket artillery is less efficient in this aspect because you accelerate and push both the warhead and the propellant in the initial stages and the propellant is burned as the rocket flies. You need a dozen times more propellant for rockets than tube. Propellants are mix of fuel and oxidizers: they are unstable with long-term storage. Meanwhile howitzer barrels have practically infinite storage life once slathered with cosmoline.\n\nOn the other hand, because of the high and sudden acceleration in tubes, it's harder to make electronics that will survive the acceleration and than more gradual acceleration of rockets. More of the tube shell need to be the steel casing (most of the weight of an HE shell is the steel casing). The rocket's warhead's outer wall may only need to be a light aluminium shell, leaving the hollow cavity to be filled with specialised payload (cluster munitions, scatmines, thermobarics, bunker busting, etc ...)\n\nTube artillery platforms are also heavier than the equivalent range and payload rocket platforms. What this means in practice is that a gun that fires a shell to the same range as that of an ATACMS will be of ridiculous size and weight. \n\nWhat this ends up in practice is that most tubes above 155 mm and about 30km with RAPs are scrapped. Conversely, very few or no rocket system between the range of 120mm mortars (about 10km) and 30km, unless the platform weight is an issue (e.g. airborne troops). It doesn't seem to be worth it to have an MBT-barrel-length gun in 155 mm to shoot beyond about 30km with RAPs (RIP to ERCA); probably barrel wear issues.

Another said Kyiv expects to get six F-16s this summer and up to 20 by the end of the year.  \n>  \n>The challenges have been so severe that they\u2019ve raised doubts about the wisdom of sending the jets to Ukraine and whether doing so now amounts to a very costly show of support to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. In the months since pilots began training, including 12 in the US, the battlefield has changed, with both sides relying on cheap drones and Russia bolstering its air defenses.  \n>  \n>\u201c**People shouldn\u2019t expect miracles**\u201d from the F-16s against Russia, said Jim Townsend, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. And in terms of vulnerabilities, \u201cthose airfields are going to be nice, juicy targets, and the Russians have already been hitting some of them, just as a welcome to the real world for these F-16s.\u201d  \n>  \n>It took more than a year to get here.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Ukraine can expect to get 6 F-16s this summer and up to 20 by the end of the year - Bloomberg</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-12/ukraine-s-f-16-ambitions-snarled-by-language-barrier-runways-and-parts\">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-12/ukraine-s-f-16-ambitions-snarled-by-language-barrier-runways-and-parts</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This summer, Kyiv will finally get the F-16 fighter jets it\u2019s been insisting it needs to repel Russia \u2014 <strong><em>but in far fewer numbers than it had hoped</em></strong>.  </p>\n\n<p>The result is that Ukraine may be able to field a squadron of F-16s, anything from 15 to 24 jets, well short of the 300 its leaders have called for, according to one of the people. Another said Kyiv expects to get six F-16s this summer and up to 20 by the end of the year.  </p>\n\n<p>The challenges have been so severe that they\u2019ve raised doubts about the wisdom of sending the jets to Ukraine and whether doing so now amounts to a very costly show of support to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. In the months since pilots began training, including 12 in the US, the battlefield has changed, with both sides relying on cheap drones and Russia bolstering its air defenses.  </p>\n\n<p>\u201c<strong>People shouldn\u2019t expect miracles</strong>\u201d from the F-16s against Russia, said Jim Townsend, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. And in terms of vulnerabilities, \u201cthose airfields are going to be nice, juicy targets, and the Russians have already been hitting some of them, just as a welcome to the real world for these F-16s.\u201d  </p>\n\n<p>It took more than a year to get here. President Joe Biden dropped his opposition to sending F-16s to Ukraine in <strong>May 2023</strong>, after repeated pleas by Zelenskiy and allies to allow their transfer. Training of Ukrainian pilots began soon after but analysts have argued that the administration has been dragging its feet on introducing the aircraft \u2014 <strong>partly out of fear that it will provoke President Vladimir Putin</strong>.  </p>\n\n<p><em>Biden and other allies have been hesitant to allow Kyiv permission to use western-provided weapons to strike inside Russia amid concerns of escalating the conflict with a nuclear-armed adversary.</em>  </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe enthusiasm of our leaders for rapidly developing a demonstrative air capability for Ukraine is lacking,\u201d said Philip Breedlove, NATO\u2019s chief commander at the time of Russia\u2019s 2014 takeover of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean peninsula. \u201c<strong>We do not want to have to face what might occur if Ukraine was to develop a very successful capability quickly</strong>.\u201d  </p>\n\n<p>But developments have changed the thinking of western leaders, not least the stepped-up air barrages from Russia and the clear signs that it\u2019s dominating Ukraine\u2019s airspace.  </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe Russian counteroffensive recently has made up the minds of some of the allies in terms of having to respond to Ukrainian requests,\u201d said Simona Soare, senior lecturer at Lancaster University. \u201c<strong><em>There\u2019s always that question of whether money and resources could have been sent a different way</em></strong>.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

You may not be interested in that, suit yourself.\n\n>on a side note, most of the ruined bodies were blurred out or covered by a tarp, this is evident in every news reporting of the incident)\n\nYou're watching filtered vids from the news, I'm watching raw footage from the ground. The vast majority of bodies and wounded were not covered up in those vids since the vids took place **before** that.\n\nIt is obvious that you're not interested in a honest discussion.

They share the goal of overcoming the vestiges of earlier confrontation and competition and of strengthening mutual trust and cooperation.\n\nSeeing how the Russian government claims it's at war with NATO, I'm not sure this act matters much at this point, unfortunately.
