Collectively these camps comprise an enormous security risk to the region and according to Gen. Kurilla, CENTCOM commander, \n\n>\u201cThis place is a literal breeding ground for the next generation of ISIS, these young people are vulnerable to radicalization given their very poor quality of life.\u201d\n\nISIS maintains limited governance over the camp residents and enforces their power through their typical application of violence. \n\n>In one video, shared for the first time with CNN, a woman is accused of collaborating with camp administrators. She is beaten and then beheaded inside Al-Hol\n\nThe camps provide a constant source of recruits for ISIS allowing them to begin rebuilding their presence in the Syrian desert. \n\n>Every month a couple dozen 10- to 15-year-old boys are smuggled out of Al-Hol to ISIS training camps\n\nISIS supporters within the camps work to ensure that there is a steady supply of willing fighters. The SDF, which runs the camp, says that children are being radicalized by their mothers. They also claim that boys as young as 14 are being married off to birth the next generation of fighters. In response \n\n>the SDF has introduced an official policy that separates boys at 14 from their mothers, placing them in two purpose-built facilities that it calls \u201crehabilitation\u201d centers. CNN met children as young as 11 in one of the centers, suggesting that camp officials are going beyond that policy. One woman in Al-Hol claimed her 10-year-old son was detained for trying to escape the camp, and that boys are often taken away at age 12. \n\nThe center that CNN visited provides a much greater quality of life than Al-Hol. \n\n>Compared to Al-Hol, the Orkesh \u201crehabilitation\u201d center, where some boys and young men are detained, seems like a sanctuary. \n\n>At the center, they have rooms with beds, three meals per day and psychological support five days a week. \n\n\nThese camps are an example of the enduring legacy of ISIS' caliphate and the challenges it still poses to the region today. I think the camps are one of the biggest long-term security risks in the region with the worst case scenario being a massive jailbreak dumping thousands of jihadis into the mix. I wouldn't be surprised if the total number of potential combatants across the entire camp system exceeded 10,000. \n\nWhat do people think of the SDF's attempts to address the radicalization issue? It's called an absolute breach of international law by the former UN official in the article and brings to mind shades of the definition of genocide, specifically the prohibition on the transfer of children. On the other hand that's in some ways exactly the goal, to destroy ISIS in totality, so the similarity is unsurprising. Further, the criticism of the policy appears to carry with it the privilege of the uninvolved. It's easy to demand the SDF do something else, it's much harder to actually come up with a plausible alternative. I don't know how one goes about de-radicalizing an entire population against their will.",

Collectively these camps comprise an enormous security risk to the region and according to Gen. Kurilla, CENTCOM commander, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cThis place is a literal breeding ground for the next generation of ISIS, these young people are vulnerable to radicalization given their very poor quality of life.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>ISIS maintains limited governance over the camp residents and enforces their power through their typical application of violence. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In one video, shared for the first time with CNN, a woman is accused of collaborating with camp administrators. She is beaten and then beheaded inside Al-Hol</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The camps provide a constant source of recruits for ISIS allowing them to begin rebuilding their presence in the Syrian desert. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Every month a couple dozen 10- to 15-year-old boys are smuggled out of Al-Hol to ISIS training camps</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>ISIS supporters within the camps work to ensure that there is a steady supply of willing fighters. The SDF, which runs the camp, says that children are being radicalized by their mothers. They also claim that boys as young as 14 are being married off to birth the next generation of fighters. In response </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>the SDF has introduced an official policy that separates boys at 14 from their mothers, placing them in two purpose-built facilities that it calls \u201crehabilitation\u201d centers. CNN met children as young as 11 in one of the centers, suggesting that camp officials are going beyond that policy. One woman in Al-Hol claimed her 10-year-old son was detained for trying to escape the camp, and that boys are often taken away at age 12. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The center that CNN visited provides a much greater quality of life than Al-Hol. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Compared to Al-Hol, the Orkesh \u201crehabilitation\u201d center, where some boys and young men are detained, seems like a sanctuary. </p>\n\n<p>At the center, they have rooms with beds, three meals per day and psychological support five days a week. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These camps are an example of the enduring legacy of ISIS&#39; caliphate and the challenges it still poses to the region today. I think the camps are one of the biggest long-term security risks in the region with the worst case scenario being a massive jailbreak dumping thousands of jihadis into the mix. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the total number of potential combatants across the entire camp system exceeded 10,000. </p>\n\n<p>What do people think of the SDF&#39;s attempts to address the radicalization issue? It&#39;s called an absolute breach of international law by the former UN official in the article and brings to mind shades of the definition of genocide, specifically the prohibition on the transfer of children. On the other hand that&#39;s in some ways exactly the goal, to destroy ISIS in totality, so the similarity is unsurprising. Further, the criticism of the policy appears to carry with it the privilege of the uninvolved. It&#39;s easy to demand the SDF do something else, it&#39;s much harder to actually come up with a plausible alternative. I don&#39;t know how one goes about de-radicalizing an entire population against their will.</p>\n</div>",

The barrels are vetted for 500 shells, but the CEO famously stated at the beginning of the war that the rifling is still holding up till/after 20 000 shells. If that holds true, even the lowest bound of 100 barrels would sustain 2 millions shells, and 500 barrels would be able to fire 10 million shells (over 5 years). For me, it was interesting to see some numbers for the barrel degradation/sustainment. Question: How interopable are NATO 155 barrels/guns? Even if it's not intended, could I fit a Pzh2000 barrel into a Caesar/Dana/Krab/Archer with some effort and have it work just fine? Or do they need independent barrel logistics?\n3.

This means Ukrainian jets cannot fly at high altitude or they risk being shot down. So they fly very low altitude, high speed attacks close to the front lines and sort of lob the bombs. This doesn\u2019t have fantastic range but can still hit targets within a few Km of the front. I suspect this will be one of the primary missions F16s are employed in. They are going to be more survivable than Ukraines current aircraft in this role and might be able to risk flying at higher altitudes, thus getting better range out of those bombs. Couple this with the ongoing degradation in Russian GBAD and Ukraine may be able to begin a campaign of similar capabilities as the Russians, albeit on a smaller scale.",
