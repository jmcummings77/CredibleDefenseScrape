It just requires each NATO member state to do what they deem necessary to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area. If the Hungarian government deems it necessary to send a strongly worded letter to all parties expressing concern and encouraging restraint, then the Hungarian government has done its duty under Article 5. </p>\n\n<p>Or, more to the point, if Poland deploys forces into Ukraine, and in return Russia strikes some Polish military targets with long-range missiles, it would be reasonable for Poland&#39;s NATO allies to deem it necessary to deploy additional air defense assets to the area and authorize them to defend Polish airspace from hostile acts, but deem it not necessary to start bombing St. Petersburg.</p>\n</div>",

They have many times the firepower Ukraine has, they're not fighting an enemy airpower and they can't achieve more than 100km^2 of territorial gain per month. Yet, they would perform 100x better than they are right now when attacking a relatively more modern army over a front that's half the front in Ukraine???",

Ukraine, like Russia had large stocks of Soviet equipment, and for the Baltic specially, tiny populations so even smaller amount of causalities can have big demographic affects.

My line here would be much less strict than Joe's but I would largely want Ukraine to focus it's strikes on military infrastructure away from major urban areas (airfields e.g) or Russian logistical sites close to the border. While restricting industrial and urban targets for Ukranian weaponry. \n\nAs far as EWS go:\n\n1. EWS are very expensive and will have to be replaced, destroying expensive targets is an effective way to slow the Russian war economy. This is a war of attrition and destroying any and all Russian infrastructure that increases attrition is important.\n2. Given Russia's nuclear posturing, weakening Russia's relative nuclear balance of power vis a vis the West is useful in marginally shifting Russia's own conception of it's relative deterrence in escalation chains\n3.
