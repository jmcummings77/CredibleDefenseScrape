        "body": "Another member's only Michael Kofman podcast dropped recently on War on the Rocks. This was a discussion with Dara Massicot of the Rand Corporation in which they discussed some of their takeaways from the early days of the conflict. \n\nKey takeaways:\n- Kofman claims to have foreseen Russian intention to launch full scale invasion of Ukraine well in advance, but struggled to get people to believe him (personal note: tracks with his public comments pre-war). He went on to claim that he purposefully overestimated the strength of the Russian military publicly and privately to try to convince people Russia will invade (personal note: this came across as very disingenuous and self-serving imo).\n- Kofman says his biggest error in evaluating Russian performance was that he believed Russian reform efforts were more widespread and effective than they actually were. Most of the evidence he based his prewar evaluation on was anecdotal and later proven wrong. Claims this was due in part to how Russia trains forces at the unit level, making it harder to get overall picture of how widespread reforms were. \n- Massicot gave a preview of upcoming Rand paper she authored that looked back at the Russian reform efforts over the past decade. Says Russian leadership actually *did* identify the issues (hazing, mistreatment of personnel, poor leadership) and took steps to address them, but that these efforts fell apart in recent years. She thinks 2014 Ukraine invasion was major turning point as Kremlin returned to form by lying to its forces, sending them to Ukraine without forewarning. \n- Both analysts believed Russia had a massive 5th column ready in Ukraine pre-February 2022 as it was the only explanation for their invasion plans which wouldn't have worked at all if Ukraine offered resistance. They note that 600-700 Ukrainians have been charged with treason, and there's evidence there was a plan in place to topple Zelensky government (note: this has been previously reported elsewhere, [Reuters has an amazing article about it](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/ukraine-crisis-russia-saboteurs/)).\n- Both were dumbfounded Russia invaded without informing its military in advance, as an operation of this scale requires months of preparation from the armed forces to plan out deconfliction, which units would move to which locations, prepare soldiers emotionally for war. They think the FSB planned the invasion, sidelining the GRU, and only a tiny handful of high-ranking officials knew about the plans in advance. \n- CIA Director Burns sat down with Russian counterpart in November 2021 and told them US knew their plans to invade and threatened massive retaliation if they went through with them. The New York Times released detailed invasion plans weeks before the war that confirmed US knew, but Russian leadership *still* didn't bring in key military figures about the plans. \n- Kofman claims the Pentagon was sure Kyiv would fall within days, as there was practically no professional Ukrainian military presence in the area on Day 1. Zelensky was more worried about economy than the potential for invasion, which he dismissed and he left Ukraine on dangerously poor footing as a result. The early days were highly contingent and much closer run affairs than many people think (note: this tracks with previous conversations in which Kofman revealed that it was TDF and armed citizens who spontaneously took up arms that prevented the capital from being overrun).\n- Massicot is surprised Gerasimov and Shoigu still have their jobs after such incompetence and failure. Kofman thinks they're still there because they're loyal to the regime, which values loyalty over all else. He thinks they'll be gone sooner or later though even in the middle of the war if it continues long enough. \n- Kofman thinks all elites in Russia have coalesced around Putin as long as the war is still running, Putin's problems begin when the war ends. \n\nPersonal notes: this was an interesting convo, but nothing particularly groundbreaking. I enjoyed hearing two Russian military experts talk about their confusion about just how poorly planned and implemented the war was from its early days, including their efforts to figure out why Russia wasnt following its own doctrine. \n\nI have a lot of respect for Kofman, but he really came across as disingenuous at times here especially when he claimed he'd rather be \"wrong for the right reasons, than right for the wrong reasons.\" His claims that he overrated Russian military on purpose also seem to fly in the face of his public comments early in the war when he was dumbfounded at Russian performance and lack of adherence to their doctrine.",

Personally, I thought they would only invade east of the Dnipro to establish a land bridge and take the Donbass to reinforce the separatists. In reflecting on what I got wrong, I've suspected that something fundamentally shifted in the mindset of Putin and the Kremlin Chekists in the 8 years between Feb 2014 and Feb 2022. This 8 year period saw a number of major geopolitical events: the passivity of US response to Crimea's seizure, the ISIS offensive, the Iranian nuclear deal, the \"rise of China\" narrative really taking hold, the development of much more aggressive foreign policy and diplomacy from China, the Trump era and ensuing domestic political chaos in the US, the European migrant crisis, Russian 2015 intervention in Syria and its success, among many other things.\n\nThere seems to have been a significant shift in the Kremlin's mindset toward a more offensive stance over the course of those 8 years. The seizure of Crimea and the Russian Syrian intervention were limited in scope to achievable aims that played to Russia's strengths within the confines of its geopolitical capabilities; in contrast, Ukraine was enormously ambitious. I think that the Kremlin began to entertain not just the exclusion of Ukraine from NATO via a frozen conflict (as it had accomplished with Georgia), but the start of a period of recapturing its old sphere of influence starting with Ukraine. Once most of Ukraine had been captured through a combination of the initial invasion gains and salami slicing following Putin's desired terms of \"peace\" (with a greatly diminished western Ukrainian rump state around Lviv), then Putin could begin instigations in the Baltics, ideally with a continually weakening NATO that had been shaken by Russian success in Ukraine.\n\nThe most striking aspect to me of the 2022 invasion was Putin's decision to not even inform the Central Bank so that they could shift the country's foreign exchange reserves to neutral or friendly banks. This indicates that Putin did not even expect the West to freeze Russian assets held in Western banks. In light of how easy and low risk such a move would be for the West, the audacity of this presumption is nothing short of astounding. In my opinion, this highlights the arrogance of the Kremlin's mindset more than anything else. The only possible counterpoint I can come up with is that shifting these assets would have been a clear indication of the Kremlin's motives, but the massive military buildup was already a strong indication (especially the moving of blood reserves to the border). I cannot imagine shifting assets would have taken very long compared to the buildup; it could have been carried out in the final weeks before Feb 24th once it was clear the rest of the world was ignoring American warnings.",

Russia intervened in Georgia in 2008 by deploying into its ethnic conclaves to establish a frozen conflict. Russia strongarmed Ukraine with gas contracts in 2009, finally securing a long-term lease of Sevastopol through 2042 and solidifying its hold over Yanukovich with the signing of the Kharkiv pact in 2010. In late 2011 Putin signed an agreement with Belarus and Kazakhstan to establish the Eurasian Union, potentially creating the foundations of a regional geopolitical order.

He had been successful in all of his prior geopolitical adventures. One might rightfully assume that he got overconfident (and somewhat isolated due to COVID).

The banks and other cash handlers then either send them back to their respective central bank, or recirculate the banknotes after checking that they are genuine and are \u201cfit\u201d to circulate.\n\nThis is related to your point about Euro deposits ultimately residing in an ECB account. This pertains to commercial banks, but I don't think central banks are able to hold these deposits of foreign currencies domestically, as opposed to physically holding banknotes in circulation, of which there are probably far too few to make any appreciable difference in repatriating Russia's forex.\n\nIt was my understanding that countries will usually hold foreign currency reserves as securities, though. [According to the NY FED's site](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/international-market-operations/foreign-reserves-management) the US possesses some $4 trillion in government-backed securities held outright.

There are other emerging markets, as well. However, actually shifting Euro-denominated reserves to other currencies would entail more work and risk. Overall, if Russia did not have straightforward options for shifting its Euro-denominated securities out of the reach of the EU and US, then safeguarding its forex reserves would not be as easy a task as I initially believed. Shifting reserves away from the EU might have finally convinced European governments that the Russians were serious about invasions because of the threat to these countries' bottom-line; as they say, money talks. This decoupling would also have lowered the stakes for EU intervention.\n\n[Here's a paper](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Relocate-Foreign-ReserveYUQ-11122013.pdf) called \"Relocating China's Foreign Reserves\" that might be helpful.

Overall, if Russia did not have straightforward options for shifting its Euro-denominated securities out of the reach of the EU and US, then safeguarding its forex reserves would not be as easy a task as I initially believed. Shifting reserves away from the EU might have finally convinced European governments that the Russians were serious about invasions because of the threat to these countries&#39; bottom-line; as they say, money talks. This decoupling would also have lowered the stakes for EU intervention.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Relocate-Foreign-ReserveYUQ-11122013.pdf\">Here&#39;s a paper</a> called &quot;Relocating China&#39;s Foreign Reserves&quot; that might be helpful. I ran across it while poking around the internet and figured it might be of interest.</p>\n</div>",

They didn't have time to plan, ready logistics, coordinate with left right units, or even get the f***ing encryption keys for the limited number of secure radios they had.\n\nLet's say the UAF is on alert beforehand and Zelensky breaks out his tactical outfits early, stops shaving early, and starts ranting on TV about how the Russians will never take Ukraine. So Putin scraps part of all of Operation Z plan and actually gives the Russian military time to prep. But so do the Ukrainians at that point, who have their own intel plus Five Eyes telling them what, where, when, why, and how the Russians are doing things. Not much of an advantage then.\n\n>defending Perekop would have been insanity. \n\n So [this terrain feature](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSWAhdzT2bPsFDBOzsnYIn0KFrXctEI367xVg&usqp=CAU) isn't defensible?

They weren&#39;t told until 1-2 days prior, some less than that. They were told they weren&#39;t even attacking, drive to X along Y route and location Z will fall without a fight. They didn&#39;t have time to plan, ready logistics, coordinate with left right units, or even get the f***ing encryption keys for the limited number of secure radios they had.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s say the UAF is on alert beforehand and Zelensky breaks out his tactical outfits early, stops shaving early, and starts ranting on TV about how the Russians will never take Ukraine. So Putin scraps part of all of Operation Z plan and actually gives the Russian military time to prep. But so do the Ukrainians at that point, who have their own intel plus Five Eyes telling them what, where, when, why, and how the Russians are doing things. Not much of an advantage then.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>defending Perekop would have been insanity. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So <a href=\"https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSWAhdzT2bPsFDBOzsnYIn0KFrXctEI367xVg&amp;usqp=CAU\">this terrain feature</a> isn&#39;t defensible?

And then Poland is expected to make an initial donation late this week or perhaps early next? I think we'll end with 75-90 or so for an initial training batch/group to establish the logistics train.

        "body": ">[U.S. asked Israel for its Hawk missiles to send to Ukraine](https://www.axios.com/2023/01/25/israel-ukraine-hawk-missile-biden-administration-request)\n\n>The Biden administration asked Israel for the old Hawk anti-aircraft missiles it has in storage in order to transfer them to Ukraine, three Israeli and U.S. officials told Axios.\n\n>Why it matters: Israel has so far rejected most U.S. and Ukrainian requests to provide advanced and defensive weaponry to Ukraine over concerns that such a move could create tensions with Russia and harm Israeli security interests in Syria.\n\n>Ukraine has repeatedly asked Western countries for such weapons to help it defend itself against Russian strikes.\n\n>Between the lines: Russia holds enormous influence in Syria but allows Israel to operate freely against Iranian activity there.\n\n>Flashback: Israel purchased the Hawk system from the U.S. in the 1960s to defend itself against Egyptian and Syrian airstrikes.\n\n>At the time, the Raytheon-developed anti-aircraft system was cutting-edge technology. But in more recent years, Israel has turned to other systems, including the U.S. Patriot battery and its own Iron Dome and Arrow defensive systems.\n\n>A decade ago, the Israeli military took the Hawk system out of service. A senior Israeli official told Axios that about 10 Hawk batteries and hundreds of interceptors remain in storage in Israel.\n\n>Behind the scenes: Senior Israeli and U.S. officials said the Pentagon reached out to the Israeli Defense Ministry two weeks ago and requested the Hawk systems that are in storage in order to transfer them to Ukraine.\n\n>A U.S. official said similar requests were made to several other countries that had the system in active service or in storage.\n\n>The senior Israeli official said Dror Shalom, the head of the policy department in the Israeli Defense Ministry, told his U.S. counterparts there is no change in Israel\u2019s policy not to provide weapons systems to Ukraine.\n\n>According to the Israeli official, Shalom told his Pentagon counterpart the Israeli Hawk systems are \u201cobsolete\u201d and can\u2019t function because of how long they've been in storage without maintenance.\n\n>But the Israeli officials say Shalom\u2019s answer to the Pentagon\u2019s request was not accurate.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2023/01/25/israel-ukraine-hawk-missile-biden-administration-request\">U.S. asked Israel for its Hawk missiles to send to Ukraine</a></p>\n\n<p>The Biden administration asked Israel for the old Hawk anti-aircraft missiles it has in storage in order to transfer them to Ukraine, three Israeli and U.S. officials told Axios.</p>\n\n<p>Why it matters: Israel has so far rejected most U.S. and Ukrainian requests to provide advanced and defensive weaponry to Ukraine over concerns that such a move could create tensions with Russia and harm Israeli security interests in Syria.</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine has repeatedly asked Western countries for such weapons to help it defend itself against Russian strikes.</p>\n\n<p>Between the lines: Russia holds enormous influence in Syria but allows Israel to operate freely against Iranian activity there.</p>\n\n<p>Flashback: Israel purchased the Hawk system from the U.S. in the 1960s to defend itself against Egyptian and Syrian airstrikes.</p>\n\n<p>At the time, the Raytheon-developed anti-aircraft system was cutting-edge technology. But in more recent years, Israel has turned to other systems, including the U.S. Patriot battery and its own Iron Dome and Arrow defensive systems.</p>\n\n<p>A decade ago, the Israeli military took the Hawk system out of service. A senior Israeli official told Axios that about 10 Hawk batteries and hundreds of interceptors remain in storage in Israel.</p>\n\n<p>Behind the scenes: Senior Israeli and U.S. officials said the Pentagon reached out to the Israeli Defense Ministry two weeks ago and requested the Hawk systems that are in storage in order to transfer them to Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>A U.S. official said similar requests were made to several other countries that had the system in active service or in storage.</p>\n\n<p>The senior Israeli official said Dror Shalom, the head of the policy department in the Israeli Defense Ministry, told his U.S. counterparts there is no change in Israel\u2019s policy not to provide weapons systems to Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Israeli official, Shalom told his Pentagon counterpart the Israeli Hawk systems are \u201cobsolete\u201d and can\u2019t function because of how long they&#39;ve been in storage without maintenance.</p>\n\n<p>But the Israeli officials say Shalom\u2019s answer to the Pentagon\u2019s request was not accurate. They stressed that while the launchers might be completely dysfunctional, the hundreds of Hawk interceptors Israel has in storage can be refurbished and used.</p>\n\n<p>The Israeli Defense Ministry reiterated to Axios in a statement that the &quot;position of the Israel security establishment [on giving military aid to Ukraine] hasn\u2019t changed. Every request is being reviewed on a case-by-case basis.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>What they&#39;re saying: Earlier this month, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin gave a speech at an AIPAC leadership conference in Washington in which he hinted at the U.S. request to Israel for the Hawk missiles.

There is a widespread view in Washington and Kyiv that regaining Crimea by military force may be impossible.

Instead, the Abramses are \u201cprobably not for the near fight,\u201d one U.S. official said, and are not likely to arrive for many months, if not years.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe want to make sure [the Ukrainians] have the ability to maintain it, sustain it, train on it,\u201d Ryder said of the Abrams.

Russians' consent to mobilization will be low, leading to domestic unrest, low morale among the mobilized and difficulty achieving planned numbers, with further mobilization being out of question.\n2. Russia won't be able to maintain production of military equipment at pre-war levels, let alone ramp it up.\n3. Russian competency at the tactical and operational level will not improve.\n\nI think #1 and #2 were mostly wrong (#2 especially), with the jury still being out for #3 (it's more subjective imo, the former 2 are easier to quantify).\n\nThere was also a sharp increase in Russian KIA figures in the daily AFU reports, the average being nearly tripled starting from early October to reach around 600-700. I think these figures might have been initially believed or at least given the benefit of the doubt, but are viewed with much more skepticism now - Ukraine claims 70k Russian KIA since mid September but merely a few thousand KIA for their side (the figures given were ~9000 in August and \"between 10000 and 13000\" in December), which isn't compatible with the evolution of the situation at the front.\n\nNow that doesn't mean Ukraine will lose, just that further escalation will be necessary for Ukraine to attain and maintain a relative advantage sufficient to achieve their political objectives, which is probably what Western officials figured out at some point in December. I don't think recent decisions have had much to do with recent Russian success in Soledar or around Bakhmut, it was already clear by early December that Russia had managed to stabilize the front and Ukraine wouldn't achieve a decisive victory in the near future without a substantial increase in aid (Zaluzhnyi himself made that point in December and I don't think the quantitative requirements he spelled out were exaggerated by much).",
