In fact, it is remarkably small with visibility very much optimized for viewing upward and forward. This makes sense for aerial refueling procedures. Beyond that, the visibility looks very poor out of the aircraft. The side small windows, which are curved as in the rendering, look as we originally posited, to likely be a low-observable compromise, with their shape minimizing the aspects that they can be seen by radar, especially from below. It will be interesting to learn more about how this feature came to be and just how far having no windows at all was pushed during the B-21\u2019s design.

This is critical. As we noted many times before, the B-21\u2019s very low observable capabilities and its far broader, more eclectic mission set, would likely see it be put to use during the day.

The inlets, which were a major challenge during the aircraft\u2019s development process, are remarkable. They appear blended seamlessly deep into the flying-wing design, minimizing line-of-sight to them and the disruption to the aircraft\u2019s flowing, almost shell-like very low-observable airframe.

New material sciences, construction, and design capabilities mean that very large composite components can be built and assembled, minimizing the number of airframe components and thus the need for many joints and seams. This is paired with major advances in LO coating and structures to drastically reduce the high maintenance costs and long downtimes associated with low observable aircraft.

The exhausts, arguably the most sensitive part of an LO design, are also a total mystery. Also, this is just the first airframe and we are likely to see additional changes, although minor in nature, to its features as it progresses towards its first flight.

If the Russians saw Ukraine making their runways long enough for F-16s they can just put holes in them. \n\n* Gripen can self start and doesn't need a large airport starter or other large equipment to support it that is hard to move around.\n\n* Gripen is easier and cheaper to maintain, no torque wrenches needs, panels easy to remove and a lot of work can be done via lesser trained people\n\n* Gripen can use meteor long range AtA missiles which would be of great use to Ukraine in their current operational situation \n\n* Swedish government could decide to give Gripen to Ukraine as a \"neutralish\" state in the same way Iran is providing drones to Russia. Might be perceived as less escalatory.\n\n* Swedish government has been having a hard time finding buyer for the Gripen so getting Ukraine on the Gripen platform might make sense for future business in selling them C/D variants. \n\nI am interested in if anyone has any different opinions about those points.

Nonetheless, in a peer-on-peer conflict, we come back to the old WW-II calculus of economic might. The USA simply outproduced its enemies. In the upcoming years, who can produce the most capable drones at the lowest price points and the highest quantities? Who can produce the most capable defense against the other side's drones?  In the RU/UA war, it has been reported that inexpensive rotary drones have a lifetime of about 3 flights, and 6 flights for fixed wing drones, so large stocks and/or high production rates are important. Those low figures might be even lower if facing an army well equipped with anti-drone defenses.\n\nIf we look at consumer and commercial drones, China is by far the largest producer, having altogether [over 80%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1254982/global-market-share-of-drone-manufacturers/) of the world market, and 76% from a single company. This provides large economies of scale. It also provides key experience and skillsets for designers, production engineers, and so on, which will somewhat translate from the commercial domain to the military domain.

It is not the only domain in which China's industrial might gives it a key advantage. The US DOD considers China's shipbuilding capacity, which far outstrips the US, as a critical advantage for China in any protracted conflict with the US.

One hope I see is to broaden and enhance military coalitions during peacetime. If the US cannot compete with China's industrial might in key areas like drones and shipbuilding, the US plus all of its key allies together may be able to reduce the gap with a dedicated effort towards that goal.

Computing superiority allowed the US  to design early stealth and stealth like features on aircraft such as B1B and F 117. It also allowed the fly by wire. More importantly it allowed for huge surges in labour productivity that allowed its economy to continue to expand.

Stealth is the combination of passive low observable (LO) features and active emitters such as low-probability-of-intercept radars, radios and laser designators. These are usually combined with active measures such as carefully planning all mission maneuvers in order to minimize the aircraft's radar cross-section, since common actions such as hard turns or opening bomb bay doors can more than double an otherwise stealthy aircraft's radar return.[6] It is accomplished by using a complex design philosophy to reduce the ability of an opponent's sensors to detect, track, or attack the stealth aircraft.[7] This philosophy also takes into account the heat, sound, and other emissions of the aircraft as these can also be used to locate it. Sensors made to reduce the impact of current low observable technologies exist or have been proposed such as IRST (infrared search and track) systems to detect even reduced heat emissions,[8] long wavelength radars to counter stealth shaping and RAM focused on shorter wavelength radar,[9] or radar setups with multiple emitters to counter stealth shaping.[10] However these do so with disadvantages compared to traditional radar against non-stealthy aircraft. \n\nSo about the only thing we know about the B-21 is that it appears to be derived from the B-2. Intakes are mounted above the wing line, and like the B-2, I'd assume the exhausts are too. The intakes and exhausts are the hardest things to mask in regards to radar returns, putting them above the wing line makes it so ground based radar won't get a return on them, as they aren't line of sight. Like the B-2 there is no vertical stabilizer(s), since even canted they provide a flat surface that is good for radar returns. The aircraft obviously provides a very small radar cross section(RCS). \n\nHowever the RCS is always optimized from the front, as designing aircraft that had a minimal RCS from all aspects wouldn't likely be very aerodynamic. As in, not flyable. But stealth aircraft aren't \"invisible\" to radar, they still provide a return. Just a smaller one, and more so from any radar that isn't directed towards the front of the aircraft. While some of the radar emissions are absorbed by the radiation-absorbent material(RAM), most is reflected in a direction that won't be received by radar that emitted it. That doesn't mean other radars operating as a integrated air defense system(IADS) won't get a return from a different radars emission, and be able to calculate where the object is. Distance to the object also applies, the closer the stealth aircraft is to the radar the greater the chance is for a successful track. Radar can be, and have been, built specifically for detecting stealth objects.  Stealth aircraft are generally optimized against radars running the X-band range(8.0\u201312.0 GHz). The higher frequency the shorter the physical wavelength, as in at 8Ghz a full wavelength is 3.75 cm, while 250Mhz(VHF) is 1.2 meters. Shorter wavelengths tend to get a better return on stealth aircraft, and the RAM coating is less effective. Thales SMART-L line of radars was designed in mind with the ability to track stealthy missiles. A old Soviet [P-18 VHF radar has been attributed to the F-117 shoot down in Yugoslavia in various sources](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/air-space-magazine/unconventional-weapon-23371597/). \n\nTypical radar cannot \"see\" over the horizon, Earth is round, radio waves tend to travel in a straight line. But radio waves can be bounced off the ionosphere, and using doppler means stealth aircraft can be tracked. Australia, China, Russia, France operate OTH radars that have at least rudimentary abilities in tracking stealth aircraft. \n\nSo could a B-21 successfully operate in a high threat contested environment? Who knows, but for the time being, I'd imagine yes. Keeping in mind it's not like they'd just go in there blastin', but rather with a carefully crafted flight plan designed to minimize chances of detection.
