Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

A 60 year old general, the typical age for someone in army command or managing the staffs and bureaus, would have been born in the 1960s and would have joined the Soviet army in the 1970s. They would have been drilled for *years* in a very unique kind of offensive oriented warfare. Bill DePuy, first commander of US TRADOC, among many others says that battalion command is the most important and formative experience of any field commander. UA's highest leadership would have been a battalion commander in the 80s or 90s, when the UA was still *very* Soviet. Meanwhile battalion commanders in 2014 would be, if they stayed in, somewhere in the divisional level (or more specifically whatever the UA has above brigade (its my understanding that above the battalion level, Ukraine makes very large brigades and above *this* level, but below the Army, they have a mixture of corps, divisions, and nothing. A battalion commander in 10 years might, if their career goes well, hope to be around two levels higher). Young and ambitious men might make the jump up to army level, especially as the UA has expanded rapidly in the last year and combat experience replaces time in grade as an important determination. But nobody with 2014 field experience would have moved as high as the top of the staff system.\n\nThis cultural split is what people are complaining about now, the people at the top dont have the experience required in modern combat. But the people who *do* are mostly too junior to have moved up into the wings. Its seductive to say 'well just promote them' but there are huge managerial challenges to running the rear area offices. Theyre very important, especially the training institutions and the general staff. You cant just grab a divisional commander and say 'guess what, youre in charge of a 10k man general staff.

One of his main political objectives is \"normalization of relations with Russia\". He's very opposed to ex-opposition leader (and now prisoner) Saakashvili, he has put all the blame for the 2008 invasion on him, saying he \"provoked Russia\", he's been ambivalent on NATO membership (although his stance is officially that he wants Georgia to join EU and NATO), and is generally seen as strongly pro-Russian.\n\nGeorgia is also making a lot of money right now thanks to the number of skilled Russian men who have fled Russia to come and work in Tbilisi (many work in IT, have high wages and have come over with whatever savings they had) and also thanks to taking part in sanction evasions by serving as a re-routing point for Russian imports of sanctioned goods. At the same time, the Georgian government refuses asylum to many open critics of the Russian government, who were sent back to Russia.\n\nOn Ukraine, beyond the closeness with Russia, the Saakshvili question also makes matters delicate, as Saakashvili left Georgia (where he was condemned in absentia) and worked as governor of Odesa for some time, before ending up in a Georgian prison (his relations with Poroshenko quickly soured, he was stripped of his Ukrainian citizenship and deported, but Zelenskyy restored his citizenship after being elected); he's very eccentric (and not a great democrat) but generally well perceived in Ukraine, in a large part due to 2008 and his staunch opposition to Russia, so Ukrainian authorities have asked for him to be freed a few times and it has created further strife between the two governments, in spite of the feeling of closeness between the peoples which exists since 2014.\n\nSo the government is generally at odds with the position of the people (who are firmly pro-EU, pro-NATO and pro-Ukraine). And even in the party, there are many voices which disagree, but the government itself is mostly composed of Ivanishvili loyalists, the prime minister being one of Ivanishvili's former employees and business partner. They are even in a sort of conflict with their own president, even though she is also from the same political party (and she was also perceived as being rather pro-Russian when elected, at one point also blaming Saakashvili for the 2008 invasion, but she's been much more pro-Ukrainian since 24.02, in contrast with her government).\n\nGenerally, the political situation is a bit odd. The government is sometimes accused of trying to sabotage relations with EU in an underhanded manner, so as to influence the opinion of the population and make their stance more accepted. For example, in the last 2 or 3 meetings with heads of EU institutions, the Georgian government has done something which they knew would be condemned by the EU just prior or during the meeting (ex. imprisoning a famous journalist just before meeting Charles Michel last year), which then allowed them to say \"we will not receive any lessons which contradict our sovereignty\" etc, when the issue was unavoidably raised during the meeting. They've also been using the fear of a new Russian invasion in Georgia to stoke this, attacking Zelenskyy and EU leaders, MEPs and even NATO, saying they want to force war in Georgia, open a second front, etc, that they are seen as a pawn by the West or whatever, thereby also producing a 1:1 copy of Russian propaganda on these matters. The law on foreign agents which they tried to get adopted is also primarily aimed at curbing the influence of SCOs which push for reforms necessary to the path towards EU membership, support independent journalists, human rights, etc. At one point, they also blocked a plane which was meant to bring Georgian Legion volunteers to Ukraine..",

It actually succeeded quite well, but these years were also marked by Russia's invasion and an increasingly authoritarian practice of power (with opponents sometimes physically attacked, lots of prisons filled with people being accused of belonging to the Georgian mafia, prison torture, etc). The country got much richer, but this wealth was poorly shared with the population.\n\nIvanishvili/Georgian dream then came to power. Civil society was relatively free and pro-EU reforms (which mainly means adapting local laws to make sure they are compatible with EU legislation, but also lots of things related to free market, democratic principles, human/labour/minorities' rights, etc) continued for the first years. But over the last years, civil society and the political opposition have come under increased pressure, independent media is being shut down, journalists have been imprisoned, etc.\n\nIt was always a bit more pro-EU/NATO than Ukraine, there were civil conflicts at the start of the 90s during which Russians (mainly from the North Caucasus, but also with some state backing) already supported the separatists against the Georgian government, and there wasn't the same sense of \"brotherly nations\" as there existed between most Ukrainians and Russians prior to 2014. Even under Shevardnadze at the end of the 90s, EU and NATO membership were already seen as objectives and relations with Russia were always a bit difficult (the separatist regions became de facto Russian protectorates, where passportization (giving Russian passports to the inhabitants, and then claiming Russia had to protect them) started in 2002-2003, economic sanctions were adopted in years before the invasion, etc). But yes, the invasion solidified the population's pro-West view.\n\nToday, most people are disillusioned with politics and Georgian Dream is still the most supported party (although by just about 20% of the population; opposition parties are supported by about as much people if taken all together, and the other 60% are mostly disaffected with politics).\n\nIvanishvili is fantastically rich for such a small country. His wealth amounts to about 33% of the national GDP, he's richer than the state in terms of yearly budget, so he is very influential. He can be seen a bit as a crypto-pro-Russian, even if he doesn't always try to hide it, he will still say that his priorities are EU and NATO integration, even if there's an increasing divorce between these words and the deeds of the government (and even the words of the government, which is more and more directly critical of the EU, US, etc).

Bakhmut is where the bulk of the fighting is happening, it's where U.S. intelligence, the Pentagon, NATO intelligence, the U.K. MoD have all said Russian casualties are over 30k. \n\n>Also, 1.1k a day where? In all of Ukraine? Or just Bakhmut? Oh wait, you don't know.\n\nTake a deep breath and calm down.  The 100k casualty number was the total in mid November, the 200k was the total in mid-February. That's 1.1k/day across the entire front. The quote in question is also across the entire front, with a majority occurring in Bakhmut. Which is obvious. \n\n>Also, 1.1k a day where? In all of Ukraine? Or just Bakhmut? Oh wait, you don't know.\n\nTo be clear, whether or not one should hold Bakhmut isn't relevant to the numbers being presented here. Once again, your ultra sensitivity makes you think that any number that doesn't suit the Russian narrative, or the withdraw from Bakhmut narrative, is inherently biased or unreliable. Two things are possible at once: Russian casualties ARE that high, and the Ukrainians SHOULD retreat. How you can't see that is honestly beyond me. \n\n>Oh wait, neither you nor anybody else can answer those questions without totally bullshtting. But don't worry folks, they got the math figured out. Trust them!\n\nTrust whom? What are you talking about? Are you suggesting the Guarding is lying? The source is? The editor is? Twitter for manipulating the Tweet? No one is talking about math here except YOU. No one is saying that this Tweet justifies staying in Bakhmut, except YOU. Russian casualties in Bakhmut alone could be 3k/day, and it STILL might mean that the Ukrainians should retreat. \n\n>1,500 casualties/day in all of Ukraine is now the tail event of the \"standard deviation\" and yet 1,1-1,200 KIA/day just in Bakhmut was the standard deviation then.\n\nThat's literally how this works. You can have a class of students where some are 6'5, 6'6, up to 6'7. You can have another class of students where one student is 7'2. The mean of both classes can be the exact same. So can the median. So can the mode. This is really, really basic stuff. \n\n>they're trying to use shitty math to justify Bakhmut Holds\n\nOkay, so on one hand leak and say they need to get out to pressure them out, and another hand leak and justify hold.

The last thing China needs is a hostile Europe joining ranks with America's stance. European markets and capital become increasingly important as America looks to divest and decouple.\n\n\nI suspect that China will lean on both parties to broker some kind of peace agreement. Russia depends on China's acquiescence, while Ukraine really doesn't want Russia's production issues solved. With this leverage, China seems likely to blackmail *both*, and play peacemaker. If China can broker an agreement between Saudi Arabia and Iran, maybe it can work something out with Russia and Ukraine.\n\n\nThat all said, if its plans fall through (likely, given that Ukraine and Russia both have many reasons to continue the war), I forsee it continuing to ride the fence, rather than actually intervene one way or the other. Outright support for either side is just too high risk for too little reward. China would love to see the West be given a humiliation, but it also hates instability. China wants Russia as a counterweight, but also wants Europe as a market and source of capital. So, the most it is likely to do is intervene in the realm of diplomacy, given the soft power it has in the situation. Brokering any kind of peaceful resolution would be a massive win for China's international soft power, which it likely values far more than Russia's ethnohistorical grievances.",

            "body": "Strategy is one of the most abused words in defense policy. Moreover, many laymen are even sloppier about it. I blame videogames, as my father did before me. But there is very little 'strategic' about your average 'real time strategy' game. \n\nThe best definition of strategy is the Clausewitzian: Strategy is the proper correlation of means and ends to national objective. But another way, and to twist the Prussian's words, war is an act of force which compels the enemy to do your will. The act of force is your means and ends. You apply a military tool, and that force produces a change in the world around it. Means are the tools in your belt be it an army, an aircraft battle group, or an atom bomb. Ends are what those tools can do to transform a situation. My CVBG sinks your CVBG. Now you dont have a navy. \"Do your will\" represents the national objective in a conflict. What post-war world do you want to create, and what does the enemy have to do to create it. It could be total surrender, ala Japan, or national dismemberment ala Germany. Or it could be more limited, such as 'hippty hoppity get off my property,' ala Vietnam or the current war. Strategy exists in the word \"compels.\" How do you translate that act of force into the enemy deciding, politically, to give you what you want. Clausewitz says that this comes from placing the enemy into a position thats more intolerable than the one their currently in, but there is a lot more to it (and its one of his bigger limitations as a planning framework). Strategy formation is a very complicated problem, lots of countries do it differently, most of them do it poorly. But ultimately you can substitute it with the following question: how does the battle I'm fighting make a concrete contribution to the end of the war?\n\nStrategy is the highest level of military planning (but note, national policy sits above strategy. This is typically the realm of civilian policymakers, though some theorists like JL Gaddis propose a 'grand strategic' layer in which military offices and policymakers help to craft national policy. Im not convinced). Below that is operations, below that are tactics. Strategy tells you what you have to do on the battlefield to accomplish the policy objectives set for the military. First you have to liberate France and revive a core ally, then you have to occupy the German industrial core, then capture Germany's political center. An additional, mid campaign, objective becomes to neutralize sights used to attack the British homeland and allied shipping. These objectives are accomplished by many many smaller battles, each one of which is insignificant. That is the tactical layer. Operations sits in the center of the sandwich and takes an otherwise insignificant battle, for example the battle at Mortain, and links it together into a broader context, the end of which is the attainment (hopefully) of a strategic objective, in this case the liberation of Paris. \n\nTurning our lens to Bakhmut, the question to ask 'how does this battle bring either side closer to their desired outcome?' There are a couple potential answers. Russia may say, if they capture the city the line will collapse and theyll break through. Bakhmut is the first link in an operational chain which will end with major territorial acquisition or achieve some other national objective. Or they may say that the current operational objective is to weaken the Ukrainians and bleed them white. Ukraine may hope to do the same to Russia. Each claim though should be tested against the central question: does this battle somehow translate into either a larger operation, for example as Izium did, or does it on its own accomplish a strategic objective? On both counts I would say no. Russia has used too much of its strength in capturing the city that its fall will very likely culminate their offensive. There wont be any breakthrough, unless the Ukrainian Army breaks which is unlikely. They may hope to bleed Ukraine white, but attrition itself is not a strategy. We might call this the Verdun trap, trading casualties back and forth doesn't end a war it simply delays it. Attrition has to be used with maneuver, you can hollow the structure out all you want but at some point youve got to kick the door in. If you dont, it doesn't help. But at this point I would likewise say the same thing to Ukraine, holding the city may accomplish their most literal national objective, dont give up more territory, but it should be obvious that the ground has been thoroughly deprived of value. Holding it further doesn't help Ukraine hold other places, especially as they wear themselves out to do it. And it doesn't help them retake more territory, which it seems is the core of the national policy objective.  \n\nSo I would argue using this framework that Bakhmut is indeed not a strategic city, its loss or preservation does not translate into a war ending outcome for either side. It neither helps Ukraine take more territory, nor gives Russia any territory of importance, nor helps them long term hold their line. Had Russia linked the battle operationally to others, or to negotiations (end the war now while Ukraine is exhausted) I would maybe feel differently. But instead they just want to bleed Ukraine because, I would argue, their connection between national policy and tactics are broken. Russia lacks a clear rationale to win the war, hopes that *maybe* they can freeze it but has no plan to get there, and so cannot connect individual battles to anything strategic or important. Theyre basically in the 1943/44 trap the Germans were in. We can keep fighting, maybe win some battles, but how exactly will this end the war on the terms we want? Answer: it wont.",

Ask themselves what, right now, could they hope to get and how can they use the war to get it. \n\nBecause of the botched invasion and a year of fighting Russia doesn\u2019t have the capacity to relaunch an all out offensive ala last March, likely it\u2019s means are so depleted as to be unable to produce an outcome that would totally collapse the Kyiv government. So if their goal is still total victory, it\u2019s unrealistic. They need to set an intermediate goal, such as formalizing the Feb 22 borders, and then produce a negotiated settlement on those terms. If that\u2019s the objective, that would suggest a defensive strategy in which territory is conserved, and the Army\u2019s means are replenished. They don\u2019t need more territory, but need an operational concept and the material wherewithal to maintain what they\u2019ve got. If I were an advisor, I would say strategically goal #1 is to hold as much ground as is feasible in all sectors, then #2 trade fringe territory for recognition of core areas, and central needs. EG., how much of the land bridge is really needed to keep access to Crimea open? Or the Svatove line. This then forms an operational concept based around (again) two central needs, to hold the territorial losses to a minimum, and to inflict a defeat on Ukraine militarily which forces them to negotiate. The path to victory would be to hold the line against low level pressure, inflict one or several clear defeats against Ukraine in a mobile defense, and then pair that with offers of a negotiated settlement brokered by the international community. \n\nAttacking these little cities does nothing for Russia. It weakens their forces, so they are less likely to meet a new offensive. None of the cities will force Ukraine to negotiate. Maybe Russia will trade Bakhmut for something at the negotiable table but what? There isn\u2019t a clear path to an obvious concession beyond \u201creturn to Feb 22 borders\u201d. Bakhmut isn\u2019t particularly large, wasn\u2019t a major economic producer pre war, etc. The hard truth is that it is no Kherson, which had strategic value. And none of these little towns around it will have any value whatsoever once the battle ends. We\u2019ll probably go the rest of our lives without worrying about Soledar. Where Russia needs a strategic reset, it has been doubling down on the same failed, and now bankrupt strategic concept. \n\nBut I\u2019m not a Russian advisor. I genuinely wonder what Putin wants, what kind of outcome he\u2019s looking for. Perhaps a frozen conflict to try again in five years? Lot of people say his regime is on the line now, but I\u2019m unconvinced he seems more entrenched in the Kremlin than ever. Will some hitherto unidentified cabal depose him, unless he takes Bakhmut? I really think Russia is intellectually constipated currently. It\u2019s not that they have a new plan, but that they have no plan.

But the Ukrainian strategy for Bakhmut can't attrit anything else that isn't in Bakhmut. Meanwhile, the Russian strategic level offensive in the Donbas (whether its intending to or not) acts as a spoiling attack for UAF future offensive capabilities because their current offensive is happening on a broad front, so many more UAF forces are fighting and losing troops, their overall supply situation is affected especially artillery ammo, and their strategic reserve is affected as they have to commit units from it to reinforce various places, especially and repeatedly to Bakhmut.  \n\nIt also hinges on an assumption that Ukrainian casualties will remain light in Bakhmut despite the terrible tactical situation.

Are the newly forming Ukrainian National Guard assault brigades going to punch through that because Wagner and the 106th VDV division were hurt in Bakhmut? \n\nAnd its strategically detrimental because focusing on Bakhmut over other strategic locations is why Avdiivka is currently being outflanked. Why can't the UAF hold there? Because so many units and resources are going to Bakhmut. So if the whole point is to degrade Russian defensive capabilities, they're not even degrading current Russian offensive capabilities because they're making dangerous progress in other places besides Bakhmut, where they're still making progress too.

Are the newly forming Ukrainian National Guard assault brigades going to punch through that because Wagner and the 106th VDV division were hurt in Bakhmut? </p>\n\n<p>And its strategically detrimental because focusing on Bakhmut over other strategic locations is why Avdiivka is currently being outflanked. Why can&#39;t the UAF hold there? Because so many units and resources are going to Bakhmut. So if the whole point is to degrade Russian defensive capabilities, they&#39;re not even degrading current Russian offensive capabilities because they&#39;re making dangerous progress in other places besides Bakhmut, where they&#39;re still making progress too.  If they still have successful offensive capabilities, they definitely still have defensive capabilities.</p>\n</div>",
