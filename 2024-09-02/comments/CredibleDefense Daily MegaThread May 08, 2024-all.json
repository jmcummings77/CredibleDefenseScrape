As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

        "body": "This morning the bill on the enlistment of convicts was passed on the second (and final) reading by the Verkhovna Rada - with 279 Yes, 11 abstentions and 40 not voting. [This](https://www.kyivpost.com/uk/post/32326) is the best article, in Ukrainian, I could find on the subject.\n\nA brief resume. Convicts will undergo prior medical examinations inside the prison in order to attest to their physical fitness and mental sanity. Both the consent of the convict (who must therefore be a volunteer) and of the UAF are needed. As I understand it, the convicts will serve in separate penal units created within, I guess, brigades whose commanders agree to form them and agree to take in the convicts. \n\nIf the convict passes the medical examination, he shall be taken to the Territorial Recruitment Center by the National Guard, where he will sign a contract. It's not possible to go volunteer as a convict if there is less than 3 years left until the end of the prison sentence. The length of the contract is not specified, but this last point makes me think it's going to be a standard 3-year contract, which is what any non-convict Ukrainian man can sign. The pay is also not specified, but it might be the standard pay of a contract soldier - probably this point has not been clarified yet. \n\nThose who have committed crimes against the nation (including corruption), crimes as an institutional representative, murder of two or more persons, murder in general when committed under the influence of drugs (including if committed while driving under the influence), murder of law enforcement officers, sexual assault (including rape, pedophilia etc.), and terrorism will not be allowed to volunteer under any circumstances. Apparently, those convicted of crimes related to drug production and trafficking will not be able to join the ranks of the UAF (this last thing, personally, seems very strange).\n\nOut of 26 thousand people currently held in Ukrainian detention centers and jails, between 15 and 20 thousand meet the requirements. Those who sign a contract will be released on parole during the term of the contract. At the end of the contract I imagine there will be an amnesty, although this is not yet specified. Those who break their terms of service will receive an additional sentence of 5 to 10 years in prison, which is in addition to the sentence from which they were released on parole. Volunteer convicts shall not be entitled to any leave, except in the case of injuries, which has to be carried out at the specified place anyway (e.g. a rehabilitation center).\n\nArakhamia, the leader of the parliamentary faction of \u201cServants of the People\u201d, stated this law will bring in several thousand volunteers from the jails at the very least.\n\nAnother thing, which the vast majority of newspapers aren't mentioning - although it's very important - it's the fact that (as announced a few months ago), some 50 thousand formerly detained and now free men, who are currently exempt from mobilization, are going to be mobilizable - meaning they can be summoned by the local TRC (without following the procedures required for convicts, of course). A certainly significant figure. In addition, since February 2022, 11 thousand criminal cases [were suspended](https://censor.net/ua/news/3488272/zupynennya_rozglyadu_kryminalnyh_sprav_cherez_mobilizatsiyu_obvynuvachenyh) after the person under investigation chose to voluntarily join the ranks of the UAF (I did not know such a possibility existed). Very interestingly, the number of people volunteering under this framework has been stable since summer 2022, averaging around 400 cases per month. Theft (including car theft) and robbery alone account for about 1/4 of the crimes for which volunteers were being investigated and whose prosecutions were suspended.\n\n\n***\n\nNow, on an unrelated note, an update from the Ukrainian military observer Mashovets on an issue in which the Russians have been improving lately: the reconnaissance and strike complex. Translated via DeepL. \n\n>The Russian command is actively introducing new systems of organizing and delivering fire in the course of combat operations based on the experience it gained during the Russian-Ukrainian war.\n\n>In particular, the enemy has recently developed and is actively implementing a hierarchical (ranked) three-level system for the use and application of its RUKs (reconnaissance and strike complexes). The so-called \u201csystem of combating the enemy's armored vehicles and artillery\u201d\n\n>We have already seen the consequences of this \u201csystematization\u201d (defeat of Patriot SAMs, Hymars MLRS, etc.)\n\n>The content consists in simultaneous \u201clinking\u201d into a single system, operating in the \u201conline\u201d mode, reconnaissance and situation monitoring means with appropriate means of defeat, as well as a clear distribution by zones and distances of defeat (providing for the distribution and appropriate management of specially equipped or adapted KPIs)...\n\n>In particular...\n\n>The close (tactical) zone is the responsibility of the division (brigade) commander, up to 10-12 km.\n\n>Means of reconnaissance and monitoring, as well as radio-electronic warfare (REW) - optoelectronic devices (1TPN-1, Ironia-1, Ironia-M), copter-type UAVs, Aleron-3 UAVs, Fara-VR and Sobolyatnik radar stations, Sextan K144 reconnaissance and signaling equipment, and Field-21 modular radio jamming system.\n\n>Means of destruction (firepower) - anti-tank missile systems (ATK) \u201cKonkurs\u201d, \u201cAtaka\u201d, \u201cKornet\u201d, \u201cShturm-S\u201d, \u201cChrysanthema-S\u201d, \u201cKornet-D\u201d, anti-tank gun MT-12 \u201cRapira\u201d \u201c, Gvozdika and Akatsiya SAU, tanks, Terminator BMPT, BMP-2/3, TOS-1/TOS-2, fire support helicopters (Mi-24, Mi-35, Mi-28N, Ka-50, Ka-52), Su-25 attack aircraft.\n\n>Medium zone, responsibility of the army commander (army corps) from 12 to 100 km\n\n>Reconnaissance and monitoring means - UAVs \u201cAileron-3\u201d, \u201cOrlan-10\u201d, \u201cForpost\u201d and a number of similar in their specifications, radar stations (radars) such as \u201cAistenok\u201d and \u201cSobolyatnik\u201d, as well as radars for counter-battery warfare such as \u201cZoo\u201d, etc.\n\n>Means of defeat (fire) - barrage munitions such as \u201cKub\u201d and \u201cLancet\u201d, MLRS \u201cTornado-G\u201d, \u201cUragan\u201d, \u201cTornado-S\u201d, SAU \u201cMsta-S\u201d, \u201cHyacinth-S\u201d, SG \u201cMalka\u201d \u201c, mine barriers such as UMZ, aircraft Su-24M and Su-34.\n\n>Far zone, the responsibility of the commander of the UW (grouping of troops) from 100 km and more.\n\n>Means of reconnaissance and monitoring - spacecraft (SC) of the Yantar optoelectronic reconnaissance system, agent reconnaissance and UAVs of the Forpost type and similar ones, whose technical specifications allow for optoelectronic and radio-technical reconnaissance at distances up to 100 and more.\n\n>Means of destruction (firing) - Iskander-M missile system, Tu-22M3, Mig-31K\\I, Su-24, Su-34 aircraft, attack UAVs of the Geranium type \\Shahed-131/136 and STRGR (on S-300/400 SAMs).\n\n>Some of these means of defeat are used both in the interests of the commanders of individual military units and to defeat targets of a strategic nature.\n\n>That is, for several months now, the Russians have been trying to apply all this not separately, \u201cby order\u201d of individual commanders, commanders (chiefs), as they say \u201cif necessary\u201d... but to systematize and link it into a single clear system. Especially, regarding the process of \u201cdata transfer\u201d, from the moment of detection to the moment of defeat (their problems with this are non-critical, localized and can be eliminated).\n\n>In order for it to work as a clear mechanism as a whole, rather than in its individual elements, they need to acquire two key capabilities - the ability to operate \u201conline\u201d in these intelligence and strike loops, and at all three of these levels, and to minimize the number of \u201clinking\u201d links of command and control between intelligence and defeat.\n\n>In other words, for this they need appropriate means of AUTOMATIZATION (well, and accordingly, properly equipped PUs)... and most importantly, a kind of \u201cinternet\u201d between intelligence and fire. It is obvious that this system will not work effectively \u201cbecause of TAP-ic\u201d or \u201cvoice over radio\u201d....\n\n>Not everything is working out for them in this area right now, but they are trying very hard... And, unfortunately, we can already observe the first results of this systematization of the enemy defeat system in practice.\n\nhttps://t. me/zvizdecmanhustu/1841",

In addition, since February 2022, 11 thousand criminal cases <a href=\"https://censor.net/ua/news/3488272/zupynennya_rozglyadu_kryminalnyh_sprav_cherez_mobilizatsiyu_obvynuvachenyh\">were suspended</a> after the person under investigation chose to voluntarily join the ranks of the UAF (I did not know such a possibility existed). Very interestingly, the number of people volunteering under this framework has been stable since summer 2022, averaging around 400 cases per month. Theft (including car theft) and robbery alone account for about 1/4 of the crimes for which volunteers were being investigated and whose prosecutions were suspended.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Now, on an unrelated note, an update from the Ukrainian military observer Mashovets on an issue in which the Russians have been improving lately: the reconnaissance and strike complex. Translated via DeepL. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Russian command is actively introducing new systems of organizing and delivering fire in the course of combat operations based on the experience it gained during the Russian-Ukrainian war.</p>\n\n<p>In particular, the enemy has recently developed and is actively implementing a hierarchical (ranked) three-level system for the use and application of its RUKs (reconnaissance and strike complexes). The so-called \u201csystem of combating the enemy&#39;s armored vehicles and artillery\u201d</p>\n\n<p>We have already seen the consequences of this \u201csystematization\u201d (defeat of Patriot SAMs, Hymars MLRS, etc.)</p>\n\n<p>The content consists in simultaneous \u201clinking\u201d into a single system, operating in the \u201conline\u201d mode, reconnaissance and situation monitoring means with appropriate means of defeat, as well as a clear distribution by zones and distances of defeat (providing for the distribution and appropriate management of specially equipped or adapted KPIs)...</p>\n\n<p>In particular...</p>\n\n<p>The close (tactical) zone is the responsibility of the division (brigade) commander, up to 10-12 km.</p>\n\n<p>Means of reconnaissance and monitoring, as well as radio-electronic warfare (REW) - optoelectronic devices (1TPN-1, Ironia-1, Ironia-M), copter-type UAVs, Aleron-3 UAVs, Fara-VR and Sobolyatnik radar stations, Sextan K144 reconnaissance and signaling equipment, and Field-21 modular radio jamming system.</p>\n\n<p>Means of destruction (firepower) - anti-tank missile systems (ATK) \u201cKonkurs\u201d, \u201cAtaka\u201d, \u201cKornet\u201d, \u201cShturm-S\u201d, \u201cChrysanthema-S\u201d, \u201cKornet-D\u201d, anti-tank gun MT-12 \u201cRapira\u201d \u201c, Gvozdika and Akatsiya SAU, tanks, Terminator BMPT, BMP-2/3, TOS-1/TOS-2, fire support helicopters (Mi-24, Mi-35, Mi-28N, Ka-50, Ka-52), Su-25 attack aircraft.</p>\n\n<p>Medium zone, responsibility of the army commander (army corps) from 12 to 100 km</p>\n\n<p>Reconnaissance and monitoring means - UAVs \u201cAileron-3\u201d, \u201cOrlan-10\u201d, \u201cForpost\u201d and a number of similar in their specifications, radar stations (radars) such as \u201cAistenok\u201d and \u201cSobolyatnik\u201d, as well as radars for counter-battery warfare such as \u201cZoo\u201d, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Means of defeat (fire) - barrage munitions such as \u201cKub\u201d and \u201cLancet\u201d, MLRS \u201cTornado-G\u201d, \u201cUragan\u201d, \u201cTornado-S\u201d, SAU \u201cMsta-S\u201d, \u201cHyacinth-S\u201d, SG \u201cMalka\u201d \u201c, mine barriers such as UMZ, aircraft Su-24M and Su-34.</p>\n\n<p>Far zone, the responsibility of the commander of the UW (grouping of troops) from 100 km and more.</p>\n\n<p>Means of reconnaissance and monitoring - spacecraft (SC) of the Yantar optoelectronic reconnaissance system, agent reconnaissance and UAVs of the Forpost type and similar ones, whose technical specifications allow for optoelectronic and radio-technical reconnaissance at distances up to 100 and more.</p>\n\n<p>Means of destruction (firing) - Iskander-M missile system, Tu-22M3, Mig-31K\\I, Su-24, Su-34 aircraft, attack UAVs of the Geranium type \\Shahed-131/136 and STRGR (on S-300/400 SAMs).</p>\n\n<p>Some of these means of defeat are used both in the interests of the commanders of individual military units and to defeat targets of a strategic nature.</p>\n\n<p>That is, for several months now, the Russians have been trying to apply all this not separately, \u201cby order\u201d of individual commanders, commanders (chiefs), as they say \u201cif necessary\u201d... but to systematize and link it into a single clear system. Especially, regarding the process of \u201cdata transfer\u201d, from the moment of detection to the moment of defeat (their problems with this are non-critical, localized and can be eliminated).</p>\n\n<p>In order for it to work as a clear mechanism as a whole, rather than in its individual elements, they need to acquire two key capabilities - the ability to operate \u201conline\u201d in these intelligence and strike loops, and at all three of these levels, and to minimize the number of \u201clinking\u201d links of command and control between intelligence and defeat.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, for this they need appropriate means of AUTOMATIZATION (well, and accordingly, properly equipped PUs)... and most importantly, a kind of \u201cinternet\u201d between intelligence and fire. It is obvious that this system will not work effectively \u201cbecause of TAP-ic\u201d or \u201cvoice over radio\u201d....</p>\n\n<p>Not everything is working out for them in this area right now, but they are trying very hard... And, unfortunately, we can already observe the first results of this systematization of the enemy defeat system in practice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a>. me/zvizdecmanhustu/1841</p>\n</div>",

The next generation of EW systems must enable real-time understanding of the spectrum, and provide rapid delivery of effective countermeasures against known and new threats, across domains and modalities.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>&quot;This is exactly what Pulsar does,&quot; summarizes <a href=\"https://www.anduril.com/article/anduril-announces-pulsar/\">Anduril Industries</a>.</em> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnsyM3NPy1c\">Video</a></p>\n\n<p><em>Pulsar\u2019s open architecture enables integrations into common and joint EW and command-and-control systems to create a unified network of EW capabilities, providing more comprehensive coverage and coordinated effects across distributed operations. It also provides a software development kit that enables continuous development and integrations with third-party providers and rapid integration of best-of-breed capabilities in order to keep pace with new threats and missions.</em></p>\n</div>",

That's his goal.\n\nFrom a foreign policy perspective, it's bitter but it makes some sense.  Netanyahu got a green light and bottomless clip from America for a few months, and he mainly used that time to take the piss, and make the situation worse for America, Israel, and Palestine.

So really, his best bet was to avoid alienating both wings of his party on the issue, which is what he was trying to do.\n\nUnfortunately, now he's cutting weapons to Israel, which isn't really going to placate many ardent pro-Palestine voters at this point while it'll definitely anger pro-Israel voters, of which there are plenty in his coalition too.  \n\nAnd you might ask \"well what about people who have a more mixed opinion?  There's plenty of those\".

Among other things I can quote what bothers me the most</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Large amount of sniper fire children casualties treated at the different Gaza hospitals</li>\n<li>A disproportionate amount of journalists killed in comparison with other conflicts</li>\n<li>The uncovering of a mass grave near a hospital taken by the IDF, with women and children among them and also people with their hands tied on their back.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So yeah, sure, the 7th October episode was pure savagery from Hamas and their affiliates. The videos are there to document it. However we have been hearing about the narrative of &quot;<em>Israel, the sole democracy on the middle-East, besieged by hostile neighbor Arab populations who wouldn&#39;t bat an eye about genociding Israels population</em>&quot;, and the bottom end is that if Israel wants to be treated to such a high standard (and they should) then they should provide a considerably better track record for human rights and justice for their occupied populations.</p>\n\n<p>You don&#39;t get a free pass to do as you please just because it is Hamas that stands on the other side.</p>\n</div>",

Again, this is largely giving policy makers a pass on the situation they put the IDF and other elements of the security establishment in to begin with.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: To be clear about OP is arguing, they&#39;re suggesting the government&#39;s choices on who to lead the IDF have no bearing on its policies, priorities, and strategies. Those people then make decisions with no regard to whether or not they align with the priorities of the people that determine whether or not they keep their job. This is a non credible assertion and why I eventually stopped engaging.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "In a recent confrontation near the Donetsk region, Ukrainian forces effectively utilized the terrain's natural bottlenecks to counter a significant Russian armored advance. Deploying mobile anti-tank units in the dense forests flanking narrow passes, Ukrainian defenders neutralized several Russian tank brigades, leveraging their smaller numbers to deliver a disproportionate impact. The utilization of drone-based surveillance allowed Ukrainian commanders to meticulously monitor troop movements and coordinate precise artillery strikes, effectively using technology to bridge the gap in troop disparities.\n\nAs the battle progressed, Russian commanders were compelled to reconsider their tactics, shifting their focus toward urban areas where their armored vehicles faced fewer vulnerabilities from ambushes. However, this strategic pivot exposed Russian forces to intense urban guerrilla warfare. Ukrainian forces, familiar with the local infrastructure, set up robust defensive positions in fortified buildings and utilized underground passages for secure movement and logistics. This adaptation led to a significant deceleration of Russian advances, marking a pivotal moment in the conflict that underscored the strategic resilience and ingenuity of Ukrainian defenses.\n\nThis battle raises several critical questions and implications for the ongoing conflict. How will Russian military strategy evolve in response to these effective Ukrainian tactics? Could this lead to a shift in the types of military aid provided to Ukraine by international allies? Furthermore, what are the potential long-term effects on civilian populations in these fiercely contested areas?\n\nSpeculatively, if Ukrainian forces continue to successfully employ such tactics, it might not only stall further Russian advances but could also potentially shift the strategic calculus for both sides. This might lead to a more protracted conflict, with both parties seeking new technologies and alliances to gain an upper hand. Moreover, the effectiveness of Ukrainian strategies could encourage similar defensive approaches in other regions, potentially setting new precedents in modern warfare.",

Ukrainian forces, familiar with the local infrastructure, set up robust defensive positions in fortified buildings and utilized underground passages for secure movement and logistics. This adaptation led to a significant deceleration of Russian advances, marking a pivotal moment in the conflict that underscored the strategic resilience and ingenuity of Ukrainian defenses.</p>\n\n<p>This battle raises several critical questions and implications for the ongoing conflict. How will Russian military strategy evolve in response to these effective Ukrainian tactics? Could this lead to a shift in the types of military aid provided to Ukraine by international allies? Furthermore, what are the potential long-term effects on civilian populations in these fiercely contested areas?</p>\n\n<p>Speculatively, if Ukrainian forces continue to successfully employ such tactics, it might not only stall further Russian advances but could also potentially shift the strategic calculus for both sides. This might lead to a more protracted conflict, with both parties seeking new technologies and alliances to gain an upper hand. Moreover, the effectiveness of Ukrainian strategies could encourage similar defensive approaches in other regions, potentially setting new precedents in modern warfare.</p>\n</div>",
