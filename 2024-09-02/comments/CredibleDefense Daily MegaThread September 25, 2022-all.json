        "body": "An interesting new FT piece discussing how Western governments have responded behind the scenes to Putin's threats.\n\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/e7212f93-6635-40eb-a356-c8e1bb14cea3\n\n>Western capitals are making contingency plans should Vladimir Putin take steps towards acting on his threats of nuclear attacks against Ukraine and are sending private warnings to the Kremlin about possible consequences, according to western officials.\n\n>The Russian president\u2019s nuclear warnings are \u201ca matter that we have to take deadly seriously,\u201d White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CBS on Sunday.\n\n>\u201cWe have communicated directly, privately at very high levels to the Kremlin that any use of nuclear weapons will be met with catastrophic consequences for Russia, that the United States and our allies will respond decisively, and we have been clear and specific about what that will entail,\u201d he said.\n\n>**While they believe Putin\u2019s threats are unlikely to materialise and do not signal a formal shift in the Kremlin\u2019s nuclear strategy,** Kyiv\u2019s allies are increasing nuclear vigilance and deterrence, according to five western officials who spoke under the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.\n\n>\u201cIf he thinks the threat is going to intimidate Ukraine into capitulating or giving up 20 per cent of its territory, or intimidate the rest of us away from helping Ukraine, the opposite has happened,\u201d one US senior official said.\n\n>Two other western officials said that a nuclear strike against Ukraine would be unlikely to spark a retaliation in kind but would instead trigger conventional military responses from western states to punish Russia. One of them said: \u201cThere are a lot of red lines and they are probably not in the place where [Putin] says they are.\u201d\n\n>The west\u2019s assessment is that Putin\u2019s warnings that he is \u201cnot bluffing\u201d about launching nuclear attacks on Ukraine are designed to regain momentum after Russian setbacks on the battlefield. These threats come as Moscow prepares to annex occupied territories in eastern and southern Ukraine following referendums hastily staged by Kremlin proxies.\n\n>Putin\u2019s plan appears to frame the war as a defensive conflict after claiming those regions part of Russia, officials and analysts say. The Russian president has accused the west of \u201cnuclear blackmail\u201d and claimed without evidence that Ukraine is developing weapons of mass destruction to threaten Moscow.\n\n>Under Russia\u2019s nuclear doctrine, this could justify the use of nuclear weapons to protect the country\u2019s territorial integrity.\n\n>\u201cWe have our own military potential. If anyone thinks that we won\u2019t use it if there is a serious threat, then they are mistaken,\u201d said Dmitry Novikov, deputy chair of the foreign affairs committee in the Duma, Russia\u2019s lower house of parliament. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re ready to use these kinds of weapons, we won\u2019t let ours get rusty.\u201d\n\n>If Putin resorts to nuclear weapons, the most likely scenario might be that he would test or use a tactical nuclear weapon \u2014 a smaller, more targeted device designed to be used on a battlefield \u2014 to deter the west from supporting Ukraine, officials and analysts said.\n\n>US president Joe Biden has said that if Putin uses nuclear weapons, Washington\u2019s response would be \u201cconsequential . . . depending on the extent of what they do will determine what response would occur\u201d.\n\n>Three of the five officials said that Nato member states have also communicated that message privately to Moscow, highlighting the scale of the response that any use of nuclear weapons would trigger. They suggested this threat of retaliation would continue to be the best deterrent.\n\n>\u201cWe\u2019ve done similar private messaging, even more precise about the impact it would have in terms of Russia\u2019s pariah-state status, and our response,\u201d the senior US official said.\n\n>The US had also discussed scenarios with the Ukrainians about possible nuclear use and walked through \u201cprotection and safety\u201d, the official added.\n\n>The logistics of deploying nuclear weapons is complex, time-consuming and would be easily picked up by western intelligence satellites. That means that Putin can intensify the nuclear threat by taking several steps before getting to the point of actually using the weapons. It would also allow the west to adjust its preparedness.\n\n>\u201cRussian nuclear weapons are staged in hardened shelters across the country . . . The process of transitioning to readiness, mating warheads to delivery platforms, would generate a great deal of observable phenomena for US intelligence,\u201d said Simon Miles, an assistant professor at Duke University\u2019s Sanford School of Public Policy. \u201cAnd, an opportunity for Washington to make it explicit to the Kremlin just how bad an idea that would be.\u201d\n\n>While Putin could gradually mobilise the Russian nuclear arsenal by ostensibly moving weapons and people, this is a step upon which he did not follow through after previously making nuclear threats, according to analysts.\n\n>\u201cPutin would much rather threaten to use nuclear weapons and get concessions than actually use them,\u201d said James Acton, co-director of the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n>Russia\u2019s poor co-ordination of its conventional military units since the start of its invasion of Ukraine suggests that nuclear strikes may not materially change the outcome on the battlefield, some military experts also said.\n\n>\u201cYou need some kind of integration with your conventional forces, whether you want to stop an attack or advance.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>An interesting new FT piece discussing how Western governments have responded behind the scenes to Putin&#39;s threats.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e7212f93-6635-40eb-a356-c8e1bb14cea3\">https://www.ft.com/content/e7212f93-6635-40eb-a356-c8e1bb14cea3</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Western capitals are making contingency plans should Vladimir Putin take steps towards acting on his threats of nuclear attacks against Ukraine and are sending private warnings to the Kremlin about possible consequences, according to western officials.</p>\n\n<p>The Russian president\u2019s nuclear warnings are \u201ca matter that we have to take deadly seriously,\u201d White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CBS on Sunday.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe have communicated directly, privately at very high levels to the Kremlin that any use of nuclear weapons will be met with catastrophic consequences for Russia, that the United States and our allies will respond decisively, and we have been clear and specific about what that will entail,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p><strong>While they believe Putin\u2019s threats are unlikely to materialise and do not signal a formal shift in the Kremlin\u2019s nuclear strategy,</strong> Kyiv\u2019s allies are increasing nuclear vigilance and deterrence, according to five western officials who spoke under the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf he thinks the threat is going to intimidate Ukraine into capitulating or giving up 20 per cent of its territory, or intimidate the rest of us away from helping Ukraine, the opposite has happened,\u201d one US senior official said.</p>\n\n<p>Two other western officials said that a nuclear strike against Ukraine would be unlikely to spark a retaliation in kind but would instead trigger conventional military responses from western states to punish Russia. One of them said: \u201cThere are a lot of red lines and they are probably not in the place where [Putin] says they are.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The west\u2019s assessment is that Putin\u2019s warnings that he is \u201cnot bluffing\u201d about launching nuclear attacks on Ukraine are designed to regain momentum after Russian setbacks on the battlefield. These threats come as Moscow prepares to annex occupied territories in eastern and southern Ukraine following referendums hastily staged by Kremlin proxies.</p>\n\n<p>Putin\u2019s plan appears to frame the war as a defensive conflict after claiming those regions part of Russia, officials and analysts say. The Russian president has accused the west of \u201cnuclear blackmail\u201d and claimed without evidence that Ukraine is developing weapons of mass destruction to threaten Moscow.</p>\n\n<p>Under Russia\u2019s nuclear doctrine, this could justify the use of nuclear weapons to protect the country\u2019s territorial integrity.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe have our own military potential. If anyone thinks that we won\u2019t use it if there is a serious threat, then they are mistaken,\u201d said Dmitry Novikov, deputy chair of the foreign affairs committee in the Duma, Russia\u2019s lower house of parliament. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re ready to use these kinds of weapons, we won\u2019t let ours get rusty.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>If Putin resorts to nuclear weapons, the most likely scenario might be that he would test or use a tactical nuclear weapon \u2014 a smaller, more targeted device designed to be used on a battlefield \u2014 to deter the west from supporting Ukraine, officials and analysts said.</p>\n\n<p>US president Joe Biden has said that if Putin uses nuclear weapons, Washington\u2019s response would be \u201cconsequential . . . depending on the extent of what they do will determine what response would occur\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>Three of the five officials said that Nato member states have also communicated that message privately to Moscow, highlighting the scale of the response that any use of nuclear weapons would trigger. They suggested this threat of retaliation would continue to be the best deterrent.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve done similar private messaging, even more precise about the impact it would have in terms of Russia\u2019s pariah-state status, and our response,\u201d the senior US official said.</p>\n\n<p>The US had also discussed scenarios with the Ukrainians about possible nuclear use and walked through \u201cprotection and safety\u201d, the official added.</p>\n\n<p>The logistics of deploying nuclear weapons is complex, time-consuming and would be easily picked up by western intelligence satellites. That means that Putin can intensify the nuclear threat by taking several steps before getting to the point of actually using the weapons. It would also allow the west to adjust its preparedness.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cRussian nuclear weapons are staged in hardened shelters across the country . . . The process of transitioning to readiness, mating warheads to delivery platforms, would generate a great deal of observable phenomena for US intelligence,\u201d said Simon Miles, an assistant professor at Duke University\u2019s Sanford School of Public Policy. \u201cAnd, an opportunity for Washington to make it explicit to the Kremlin just how bad an idea that would be.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>While Putin could gradually mobilise the Russian nuclear arsenal by ostensibly moving weapons and people, this is a step upon which he did not follow through after previously making nuclear threats, according to analysts.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cPutin would much rather threaten to use nuclear weapons and get concessions than actually use them,\u201d said James Acton, co-director of the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.</p>\n\n<p>Russia\u2019s poor co-ordination of its conventional military units since the start of its invasion of Ukraine suggests that nuclear strikes may not materially change the outcome on the battlefield, some military experts also said.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou need some kind of integration with your conventional forces, whether you want to stop an attack or advance. They haven\u2019t really demonstrated they can do that,\u201d said Pavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the UN Institute for Disarmament Research.</p>\n\n<p>Russia\u2019s mixed record of conventional strikes against Ukrainian infrastructure also indicated that a nuclear attack could go awry, he said.</p>\n\n<p>Ukrainians \u201ccould shoot down a [nuclear-armed] cruise missile, or a cruise missile could go astray and could hit a residential building. There is a risk of that kind \u2014 considerable uncertainty about the success of a strike.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

                "body": ">5) I'd wager Asia and the global South would emerge as the new centers of geopolitical power in the coming decades.\n\nThis is an interesting question. In the full MAD scenario, who is safe? Is this a nuclear exchange between say just Russia and the US? I'm skeptical. My bet is that once Russia sees the full US arsenal of nukes in the air they respond - not just against the US, but Europe, Japan, Australia, and anyone else else they can think of. In the same way, once the US sees the Russian arsenal in the air, I assume we would be firing as many nukes at China as Russia for our response.\n\nI figure that at the end of things everyone who (1) was aligned with someone launching nukes, (2) had some global influence that might possibly have averted the nukes, but didn't, (3) represents a sort of country you don't want to see in whenever world is eventually rebuilt from the ashes, or (4) you just never liked, is going to get nuked. I assume this is true partly because whoever is looking at the incoming nukes about to obliterate their whole country is going to want revenge against the broadest range of targets they can find.

                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>5) I&#39;d wager Asia and the global South would emerge as the new centers of geopolitical power in the coming decades.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is an interesting question. In the full MAD scenario, who is safe? Is this a nuclear exchange between say just Russia and the US? I&#39;m skeptical. My bet is that once Russia sees the full US arsenal of nukes in the air they respond - not just against the US, but Europe, Japan, Australia, and anyone else else they can think of. In the same way, once the US sees the Russian arsenal in the air, I assume we would be firing as many nukes at China as Russia for our response.</p>\n\n<p>I figure that at the end of things everyone who (1) was aligned with someone launching nukes, (2) had some global influence that might possibly have averted the nukes, but didn&#39;t, (3) represents a sort of country you don&#39;t want to see in whenever world is eventually rebuilt from the ashes, or (4) you just never liked, is going to get nuked. I assume this is true partly because whoever is looking at the incoming nukes about to obliterate their whole country is going to want revenge against the broadest range of targets they can find. And partly because increasing the number of losers under a MAD scenario increases the deterrence aspect of it.</p>\n\n<p>I figure that makes Africa the main hub of civilization, but depending on how things go maybe South America might be ok too.

Manila is strengthening its alliance with Washington due to fears of a possible war over Taiwan*\n\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/9c295755-eadf-48a9-9818-6afa1bcbe498\n\nThe Philippines and US are increasing military co-operation, including doubling\u00a0the number of troops involved in joint exercises next year, as Manila starts to consider its role in a potential war with China over Taiwan.\n\nThe US and Philippines will next year send 16,000 forces to participate in Balikatan, their main annual bilateral military exercise, said Colonel Michael Logico, director of the Philippine military\u2019s Joint and Combined Training Center, which recently hosted a planning conference with US counterparts.\n\n\u201cWe are going to do a full battle test for operating together, including in Northern Luzon\u201d near the country\u2019s sea border with Taiwan, Logico said in an interview with the Financial Times.\n\nAt annual bilateral defence talks that will be hosted by US Indo-Pacific Command in Hawaii next week, military leaders will discuss more than 500 bilateral activities for the coming year, an increase from some 300 this year.\n\nUS defence secretary Lloyd Austin and Filipino defence minister Jose Faustino Jr will meet on Thursday \u2014 the first time defence ministers from the allies will join the talks, according to two people familiar with the event.\n\n\nThe stepped up co-operation comes after China\u2019s increasing military activity around Taiwan unsettled senior Filipino officials and won their support for reinvigorating the country\u2019s alliance with the US, which was weakened when then-president Rodrigo Duterte attempted a pivot to China in 2016.\n\nIn a meeting with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr in New York this week, Joe Biden said the relationship between the countries had \u201cvery deep roots\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had some rocky times, but the fact is it\u2019s a critical, critical relationship, from our perspective,\u201d the US president said. \u201cI hope you feel the same way.\u201d\n\nGregory Poling, a south-east Asia expert at CSIS, a Washington think-tank, said there was \u201ca growing recognition of the role of the Philippines in a Taiwan scenario\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re starting to see a consensus emerge within most of the Philippines\u2019 government that the Philippines does need to deepen the alliance with the US,\u201d Poling said.\n\nOther US allies have also grown worried about the risks that a Chinese attack on Taiwan would pose for them. In recent years, Japan has stepped up consultations, planning and drills with the US for such a scenario.\n\n\u201cWe are a US ally, we are in a strategic location. We are so near that if anything happens in Taiwan we will be involved,\u201d said General Emmanuel Bautista, former chief of staff of the armed forces of the Philippines.\n\nPointing to waterways connecting the South China Sea and the Pacific through the Philippines \u2014 such as the Bashi Channel in the north and the Sibutu Passage in the south \u2014 Bautista said the Philippines was \u201ckey terrain\u201d for US-China competition because control of the country could give either side a marked advantage over its adversary.\n\nBautista said that navies used sea channels around the Philippines in the second world war to gain critical access for naval battles.\n\n\u201cEither China or the US will want to seize the Philippines to be able to control the chokepoints and the access to Taiwan\u201d in the event of a conflict, Bautista added. \u201cFor the US it\u2019s access for resupplying Taiwan, for China preventing that.\u201d\n\nOne focus is on the islands in the Bashi Channel, only 120km from Taiwan at their northernmost point.\n\nLisa Curtis, an Indo-Pacific expert at the CNAS think-tank in Washington, said Manila was \u201cwary of getting stuck in the middle of increasing US-China competition\u201d but the new Marcos government seemed realistic about what Washington might request in the event of a Taiwan conflict.\n\n\u201cWashington would almost certainly look to Manila as a staging ground for logistics support and US forces. That is why it is important for the US and the Philippines to advance talks on the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement,\u201d said Curtis, in a reference to the 2014 bilateral agreement whose implementation has significantly slowed in recent years.\n\nLast November, the two countries said they would explore additional sites in which US forces would be allowed a rotational presence \u2014 which experts understood to mean US forces could gain access to bases on those islands.\n\nLogico said a Chinese company\u2019s attempt to gain control of Fuga Island north of Luzon for a development project in 2019 \u2014 quickly stopped by the military \u2014 made the armed forces focus more on the north.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese have no use for Fuga. It really is about Taiwan, to deny us, and in extension the US, the use of those islands,\u201d Logico added.\n\nSeveral current and former Filipino military officials said the Philippines would be the most suitable corridor for US forces to resupply Taiwan with munitions in wartime.

Manila is strengthening its alliance with Washington due to fears of a possible war over Taiwan</em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9c295755-eadf-48a9-9818-6afa1bcbe498\">https://www.ft.com/content/9c295755-eadf-48a9-9818-6afa1bcbe498</a></p>\n\n<p>The Philippines and US are increasing military co-operation, including doubling\u00a0the number of troops involved in joint exercises next year, as Manila starts to consider its role in a potential war with China over Taiwan.</p>\n\n<p>The US and Philippines will next year send 16,000 forces to participate in Balikatan, their main annual bilateral military exercise, said Colonel Michael Logico, director of the Philippine military\u2019s Joint and Combined Training Center, which recently hosted a planning conference with US counterparts.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe are going to do a full battle test for operating together, including in Northern Luzon\u201d near the country\u2019s sea border with Taiwan, Logico said in an interview with the Financial Times.</p>\n\n<p>At annual bilateral defence talks that will be hosted by US Indo-Pacific Command in Hawaii next week, military leaders will discuss more than 500 bilateral activities for the coming year, an increase from some 300 this year.</p>\n\n<p>US defence secretary Lloyd Austin and Filipino defence minister Jose Faustino Jr will meet on Thursday \u2014 the first time defence ministers from the allies will join the talks, according to two people familiar with the event.</p>\n\n<p>The stepped up co-operation comes after China\u2019s increasing military activity around Taiwan unsettled senior Filipino officials and won their support for reinvigorating the country\u2019s alliance with the US, which was weakened when then-president Rodrigo Duterte attempted a pivot to China in 2016.</p>\n\n<p>In a meeting with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr in New York this week, Joe Biden said the relationship between the countries had \u201cvery deep roots\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had some rocky times, but the fact is it\u2019s a critical, critical relationship, from our perspective,\u201d the US president said. \u201cI hope you feel the same way.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Gregory Poling, a south-east Asia expert at CSIS, a Washington think-tank, said there was \u201ca growing recognition of the role of the Philippines in a Taiwan scenario\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re starting to see a consensus emerge within most of the Philippines\u2019 government that the Philippines does need to deepen the alliance with the US,\u201d Poling said.</p>\n\n<p>Other US allies have also grown worried about the risks that a Chinese attack on Taiwan would pose for them. In recent years, Japan has stepped up consultations, planning and drills with the US for such a scenario.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe are a US ally, we are in a strategic location. We are so near that if anything happens in Taiwan we will be involved,\u201d said General Emmanuel Bautista, former chief of staff of the armed forces of the Philippines.</p>\n\n<p>Pointing to waterways connecting the South China Sea and the Pacific through the Philippines \u2014 such as the Bashi Channel in the north and the Sibutu Passage in the south \u2014 Bautista said the Philippines was \u201ckey terrain\u201d for US-China competition because control of the country could give either side a marked advantage over its adversary.</p>\n\n<p>Bautista said that navies used sea channels around the Philippines in the second world war to gain critical access for naval battles.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cEither China or the US will want to seize the Philippines to be able to control the chokepoints and the access to Taiwan\u201d in the event of a conflict, Bautista added. \u201cFor the US it\u2019s access for resupplying Taiwan, for China preventing that.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>One focus is on the islands in the Bashi Channel, only 120km from Taiwan at their northernmost point.</p>\n\n<p>Lisa Curtis, an Indo-Pacific expert at the CNAS think-tank in Washington, said Manila was \u201cwary of getting stuck in the middle of increasing US-China competition\u201d but the new Marcos government seemed realistic about what Washington might request in the event of a Taiwan conflict.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWashington would almost certainly look to Manila as a staging ground for logistics support and US forces. That is why it is important for the US and the Philippines to advance talks on the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement,\u201d said Curtis, in a reference to the 2014 bilateral agreement whose implementation has significantly slowed in recent years.</p>\n\n<p>Last November, the two countries said they would explore additional sites in which US forces would be allowed a rotational presence \u2014 which experts understood to mean US forces could gain access to bases on those islands.</p>\n\n<p>Logico said a Chinese company\u2019s attempt to gain control of Fuga Island north of Luzon for a development project in 2019 \u2014 quickly stopped by the military \u2014 made the armed forces focus more on the north.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe Chinese have no use for Fuga. It really is about Taiwan, to deny us, and in extension the US, the use of those islands,\u201d Logico added.</p>\n\n<p>Several current and former Filipino military officials said the Philippines would be the most suitable corridor for US forces to resupply Taiwan with munitions in wartime. According to two people in Manila familiar with the situation, Filipino and US forces have started discussing options for this.</p>\n</div>",

Where am i going with this? Hypothetically, a few spitfires (yes actual spitfires) and world war 2 acoustic buildings (yes literal concrete \"microphones\") would be enough to shoot down these drones hitting Odesa by locating the drones through their obsessively loud engines, and then having a few flying machine guns knock them out \n\nTactical jamming, or targetted attacks against command drones or centers, would be enough to make all non coordinate based drones be useless. \n\nIn short, these drones to me seem to be working because they found a bug in the standard arsenal of defense, but at the same time, the necessary equipment to engage these drones in many ways is nearly 80 years old. And I also think we can do a lot better than 80 year old stuff.\n\nTo quote a great movie, you win by being faster, smarter, or cheating. \n\nWestern tech wins by being smarter.

Also, they will absolutely be less equipped than Russians starting the fight. \n\nThat said, the Ukrainians aren't exactly well equipped either.

Although there is no single open source profile of Taiwan's airfield infrastructure, it is possible to replicate these estimates.

According to a RAND Corporation analysis, a 500-kg M-9 ballistic-missile warhead covers almost eight times the area when using a submunition warhead than when using a unitary warhead.
