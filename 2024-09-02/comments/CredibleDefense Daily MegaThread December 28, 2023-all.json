      "selftext": "The r/CredibleDefense daily megathread is for asking questions and posting submissions that would not fit the criteria of our post submissions. As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster. Don't abuse it though! If something is not obviously against the rules but you still feel that it should be reviewed, leave a short but descriptive comment while filing the report.",

I thought the story about the Russian defector's info leading to the eventually bridgehead at Krynky was noteworthy.\n\nIs it now the general consensus that the Russian's blowing the dam was on purpose and a smart move?\n\n[Inside Ukraine's covert Center 73, where clandestine missions shape the war. Ukrainian special forces officers spent six months on the mission to establish a bridgehead across the Dnipro River in southern Ukraine after an explosion destroyed the dam upstream | AP News | December 2023](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-occupation-kherson-special-forces-9cca826e96ca244a7fea12649ff154ac)\n\n*By late May, the Center 73 men were in place along the river\u2019s edge, some of them almost within view of the Kakhovka Dam. They were within range of the Russian forces who had controlled the dam and land across the Dnipro since the first days after the February 2022 full-scale invasion. And both sides knew Ukraine\u2019s looming counteroffensive had its sights on control of the river as the key to reclaim the occupied south.*\n\n*In the operation\u2019s opening days, on June 6, an explosion destroyed the dam, sending a wall of reservoir water downstream, killing untold numbers of civilians, and washing out the Ukrainian army positions.*\n\n*\u201cWe were ready to cross. And then the dam blew up,\u201d Skif said. The water rose 20 meters (yards), submerging supply lines, the Russian positions and everything else in its path for hundreds of kilometers. The race was on: Whose forces could seize the islands when the waters receded, and with them full control of the Dnipro?*\n\n*For most Ukrainians who see them on the streets in the nearly deserted frontline villages of the Kherson region, they are the guys in T-shirts and flip-flops \u2014 just regular people. The locals who refused to evacuate have all become accustomed to the sounds of war, so even their unnerving calm in the face of air raid alarms, nearby gunfire and artillery doesn\u2019t seem unusual.*\n\n*AP joined one of the clandestine units several times over six months along the Dnipro. The frogmen are nocturnal. They transform themselves from nondescript civilians into elite fighters, some in wetsuits and some in boats. In the morning, when their operations end, they\u2019re back to anonymity.*\n\n*They rarely take credit for their work and Ukrainians rarely learn about their operations. But Russian military statements gleefully and erroneously announcing the destruction of Center 73 are an indication of their effectiveness.*\n\n**JUNE 2023**\n\n*The men had the most modern equipment, night-vision goggles, waterproof rifles that can be assembled in a matter of seconds, underwater breathing apparatus that produces no surface bubbles, and cloaks that hide their heat signature during nighttime raids.*\n\n*It was a matter of days before the start of the counteroffensive, and Center 73 had already located the Russian positions they would seize on the Dnipro River islands. Skif\u2019s men were within earshot of the June 6 explosion that destroyed the Kakhovka Dam, flooded vast stretches of the Kherson region, and upended Skif\u2019s attack plan.*\n\n*An AP investigation found Russian forces had the means, motive and opportunity to blow up the dam.*\n\n*Both the Russians and Ukrainians retreated from the river to regroup \u2014 Russians to the south and Ukrainians to the north.*\n\n*Abandoned homes, clubs, shops became headquarters, with banks of computer screens filling the rooms and improvised weapons workshops nearby. Always secretive, frequently changing locations, they meticulously plan every operation, they sleep only a few hours during the day with curtains closed.*\n\n*They wake around sunset, load gear into a 4X4 and drive to a different point on the riverbank to scout new routes for a counteroffensive, provoke Russian forces into shooting at them to pinpoint the enemy\u2019s location, retrieve soggy caches of supplies with their boat. Periodically, they captured a Russian soldier stuck in a tree or found a clutch of landmines washed up on shore.*\n\n*And they themselves were stuck. Other special forces took part in battles in eastern Ukraine, the other main front in the counteroffensive. Skif\u2019s men waited patiently for the water to subside so they could seize positions and lay the groundwork for the arrival of infantry and marines in the Kherson region.*\n\n**JULY \u2013 AUGUST 2023**\n\n*The water retreated in July. The Russians and Ukrainians advanced again toward the river from opposite directions, the Russians from the south and Ukrainians from the north.*\n\n*Groups of Center 73 scouted and advanced along the river. The mission for Skif\u2019s unit was to reclaim an island near the dam, now a web of cracked mud and dead trees. Their network of spies in the Kherson region, as well as drones and satellite images, told them where Russian forces had re-positioned.*\n\n*They disembarked the boats and moved in, walking through the bare branches of the forest through swarms of mosquitoes so loud their bodycam picked up the sound. One of the men tripped a wire connected to a grenade and flung himself as far as he could away from the Russian explosive.*\n\n*Just as the shrapnel pierced his back, mayhem broke out. The injured Ukrainian crawled toward the unit\u2019s waiting boat 3 kilometers (2 miles) away, as the Russian troops who set the boobytrap rained gunfire on them. Skif\u2019s men made it to the boat, which sprang a leak, and retreated back to their side of the Dnipro. Russians established their position on the island, and it took weeks more for the Ukrainians to expel them.*\n\n*Then new orders came. Go upstream and breach Russian defenses beneath a destroyed railway bridge.*\n\n*The men had an often-underestimated advantage over their Russian enemy: Many Ukrainians grow up bilingual and understand Russian communications intercepted in real time, while Russian soldiers need a translator for Ukrainian.*\n\n*So when Skif\u2019s unit started picking up Russian radio communications by the railway bridge, they immediately grasped how many men they were up against and the kind of munitions they would face. They made the crossing, avoided the Russians, and waited for backup,*\n\n*That\u2019s when their advantage evaporated. In a single battle, the Russians sent Iskander missiles and dozens of drones, dropping hundreds of grenades.*\n\n*\u201cIn the air, they had absolute dominance compared to us and they held the ground,\u201d he said.*\n\n*The backup was nowhere near enough. Ukrainian forces retreated under heavy fire. More men out of commission and another difficult task ahead.*\n\n**SEPTEMBER \u2014 OCTOBER 2023**\n\n*A lucky thing happened soon after that battle. A Russian officer who claimed he\u2019d been opposed to the war since its beginning was sent to the front in Kherson. It was, he later said, every bit as bad as he\u2019d feared.*\n\n*He made contact with Ukrainian intelligence and said he had 11 comrades who felt similarly. The group surrendered to Skif and his men.*\n\n*The Russians told Skif exactly what he needed to know about their unit on the island they were now tasked with taking, just outside the village of Krynky.*\n\n*He was sure he could take the island and more with 20 experienced men. But not without the promise of sufficient backup so Ukrainian regular forces could hold the territory. Fine, his commander said. He\u2019d get the backup \u2014 if he returned with footage of his unit in the village hoisting the Ukrainian flag.*\n\n*And that\u2019s how, in mid-October, a Ukrainian drone carrying the national blue and yellow flag came to fly above Krynky at just the moment Skif and his men made their way to the occupied village across the river. They got their photo op to prove the road was cleared, sent it to the military headquarters, and established the bridgehead.*\n\n**NOVEMBER \u2014 DECEMBER 2023**\n\n*Multiple Ukrainian brigades were sent to hold the position and have been there ever since.*\n\n*But nighttime temperatures are dipping well below freezing, and Ukrainian forces are vastly underequipped compared to the Russians nearby. Holding and advancing in winter is much harder on soldiers\u2019 bodies and their morale.*\n\n*In recent weeks, Russia has sent waves of glide bombs \u2014 essentially enormous munitions retrofitted with gliding apparatus to allow them to be launched from dozens of kilometers (miles) away, as well as swarms of grenade-launching drones and Chinese all-terrain vehicles, according to the Institute for the Study of War and the Hudson Institute, two American think-tanks analyzing open-source footage from the area.*\n\n*And Ukrainian forces and Center 73 keep fighting into the new year.*\n\n*\u201cThis is our work,\u201d Skif said. \u201cNo one knows about it, no one talks about it, and we do it with little reward except to benefit our country.\u201d*",

        "body": "Big substack blog from BBC Russia, on Russian personal loses and the composition of their replacements:\n\nhttps://bbcrussian.substack.com/p/russian-war-losses-in-ukraine-2023\n\nFirst I'm going to say it's interesting that this is on Substack instead of the BBC website. Not sure why that is, perhaps it's too long, perhaps it doesn't meet some other BBC guideline for publication? I read it as something that was written for the BBC but rejected for some reason or another.\n\nNotable facts:\n\n* Russia lost 1.5x more personnel in 2023 than in the first year of their invasion. Based on Oryx numbers, vehicle loses are less, so it does suggest there's a shift away from vehicles and towards infantry.\n* Convicts were a big deal starting in Nov-2022 but they have sharply tailed off as of July-2023, as seen in the plot \"Russian military loses by categories.\" The convict manpower 'surge' for Russia appears to be over, in conjunction with Wagner and other PMCs no longer being significant entities.\n* Really this plot is the main thesis statement of the article. We can even see the volunteers category increase in response to the remuneration increases in the later half of the year, although it seems to be tailing off now. I'm not clear on what the difference is between \"Volunteers\" and \"Contract Soldiers,\" however.\n* While some of the Siberian oblasts are suffering disproportional casualties, Slavs are still the supermajority of the casualties. \"This year the proportion of Slavic names among the dead increased. In spring 2022, it was 75%, while a year later it had risen to 85%.\" This is likely mostly due to convicts being from the Slavic-majority population. It would be useful to see the distribution of ethnic groups among the loses by category but either the BBC doesn't have this information or didn't want to break it down for us.\n* VVS has lost 59 personal this year in Ukraine and another 13 to Wagner. This number probably doesn't include the most recent ambuscade of Su-34s. There's also been a handful of deaths due to accidents, although more-so accidents from deferred maintenance seem to just result in airframe losses. Supposedly Russia has 7500 pilots (https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/10/25/despite-modernization-drive-russias-air-force-struggles-for-superiority-in-ukraine-a79158) so if that is in fact the case they are only suffering around 1 % attrition/year which would not seem to be unsustainable. However, that 7.5k does include bomber, transport, and reserve personnel so likely the loss ratio for front-line units is significantly more daunting. Russia certainly does not have 7.5k aircraft, rather they have about half of that and probably a quarter if we account for a practical readiness rate. Still only certain aircraft (Ka-52) seem to be suffering unsustainable attrition.\n* They provide some numbers for foreigners who were recruited into the Russian army and died but they're fairly trivial (BBC has documented 254 deaths). I would say that foreign recruits don't form a significant proportion of the Russian army based on these numbers.\n* At the end they provide an estimate of 80-100k dead and 200k seriously wounded for Russia. Honestly this number is meaningless unless we look at the means of Russia to replace their loses. There we don't know the numbers, because Russian claims are almost certainly lies, but if we look at the \"Russian military losses by categories\" plot again (really the cornerstone of the article), we can see the PMC and convict deaths are cratering, which means those two sources of recruits have dried up. The implication I have is, absent some new source of manpower for the meatgrinder, Russia can't sustain the losses they suffered in 2023 in 2024. Russia has 30M males in the 20-50 age range, so this is around 1 % loses. \n\nWhat this means vis-a-vie Ukraine isn't clear. Ukraine is also clearly having their own manpower issues. My qualitative opinion is that both sides aren't running out of men, they're running out of willing men. If the conflict continues to degenerate into a war of attrition with static lines of contact, I think it comes down to the VVS versus Ukraine's PGMs from NATO. From what we've seen from OSINT sources, Russia's getting hurt pretty bad on the vehicle side of the ledger, with very lop-sided results since September or so.",

The 25th Motorized Brigade of the 6th Army (WMD), with support from the 138th Motorized Brigade of the same army and regiments of the Territorial Forces, continues to attack Synkyvka.

The village is defended by the Ukrainian 14th Mechanized Brigade, and it appears that the entire 57th Motorized Brigade and the 2nd Mechanized Battalion of the 30th Mech Brigade have probably also been moved to the area (in both cases transferred from the northern flank of Bakhmut), while the 21st and 67th Mech Brigades should have returned to the Kreminna sector. There is also a battalion of the 95th Air Assault Brigade in the area. There have been some Russian advances, however, in the forest south of Lyman Pershyi, defended by elements of the 41st and 115th Mech Brigades and probably also of the 60th Mech Brigade, with the capture of some platoon-strongholds by the Russians.\n\nThey follow a similar pattern: a group of roughly 2-3 tanks and 3-4 BMPs advance in narrow columns, are spotted by a drone at which point artillery and FPV drone squads are contacted and prepare to engage. The lead tank hits a mine which essentially stops the advance as a whole. FPV drones, artillery and ATGM/HMG fire is then brought upon the column causing further casualties and other vehicles to diverge from the cleared path hitting further mines. The survivors are then hit by cluster munitions and more drones.\n\nIt is truly baffling that these sorts of assaults are still being ordered by commanders. On the surface they appear doomed to fail and it is hard to tell what sort of goal is being pursued.\n\nDoes anyone have insight as to what said goal could be? Any operational or strategic aims behind these costly decisions? Is it simply about pressuring the AFU?

[This article](https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw:2b909&datastreamId=FULL-TEXT.PDF) gives a good technical overview of UK contributions to modelling and testing some of the vertical and transitional flight, and ground effect. It claims that \"a significant facility at BAE Systems Brough for the measurement of thermal and acoustic effects in vertical flight that has been extensively used on the JSF programme\", and more generally \"the experience of the small team of staff that operates these facilities, gained over many decades, form a vital contribution the F-35B\". Here is another [interesting article](https://hushkit.net/2019/05/11/before-f-35-my-role-in-the-advanced-short-take-off-vertical-landing-astovl-project/) giving a more general and broader UK perspective on AVSTOL involvement.\n\nAs covered at the end of that second article, AVSTOL was followed by CALF which then got folded into JART to create the JSF programme in 1994. The UK MoD participated in the Concept Demonstration Phase (CDP) of JSF from 1995, contributing 10% of the initial budget and people.  \n\n\n>\"On December 20, 1995, the U.S. and UK governments signed an MOU on British participation in the JSF program as a collaborative partner in the definition of requirements and aircraft design. This MOU committed the British government to contribute $200 million toward the cost of the 1997-2001 Concept Demonstration Phase. On January 17, 2001, the U.S. and UK governments signed an MOU finalizing the UK\u2019s participation in the SDD phase, with the UK committing to spending $2 billion, equating to about 8% of the estimated cost of SDD. A number of UK firms, such as BAE and Rolls-Royce, participate in the F-35 program\"\n\n[https://sgp.fas.org/crs/weapons/RL30563.pdf](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/weapons/RL30563.pdf)\n\nAt this stage:\n\n>The United Kingdom is a full partner in the program, Kenne noted. That means the UK has contributed money to the development program and may have a direct say in influencing requirements. Denmark, Norway, and Netherlands-all users of the F-16-are also involved as associate partners, Kenne continued. They have contributed less money and can suggest requirements, but these will not be added \u201cunless they provide a benefit to all,\u201d she said.\n\n[https://www.airandspaceforces.com/article/1098strike/](https://www.airandspaceforces.com/article/1098strike/)\n\nThis then led to the Joint Operational Requirements Document (Joint ORD or sometimes JORD) for JSF being signed in March 2000, with the UK MoD being a signatory along with the USAF, USN and USMC. The JORD was confirmed to \"include UK specific requirements\" in a [parliamentary committee report](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmselect/cmdfence/694/694we04.htm) (which also confirms that the \"UK \\[...\\] participated in the source selection process\" of LM over Boeing). The JORD isn't publically available, but references to some of the UK-specific Key Performance Parameters can be seen reflected in [US DoD Selected Acquisition Reports](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/AD1019428.pdf) as \"UK STOVL\" requirements separate to USMC ones.\n\nIn 1997 BAe [joined the Lockheed Martin JSF team](https://www.flightglobal.com/jsf-bae-locks-on-to-lockheed-martin/3110.article), in preference to the Boeing one. Whether or not that influenced the MoD's preferences for source selection isn't for me to speculate on.\n\nThe text of the MoU between the US and UK is [available](https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/01-117.1-United-Kingdom-Defense-JSF-Suppl-with-Amend.EnglishOCR.pdf), and gives some of the privileges afforded to the UK (my highlights):\n\n>Confirming that, as the sole full Participant in this  \nProject, the U.K. MOD is entitled to participate at a level  \nnot available to additional Participants, including but not  \nlimited to: the right of initial selection among available  \nJSF Program Office billets, which will result in the  \nassignment of up to ten U.K. MOD personnel to desired  \nIntegrated Product Team billets; additional rights to  \nProject Information; and **the right to full participation in**  \n**the source selection process**, as documented in the JSF  \nSource Selection Plan;  \n>  \n>\\[...\\]  \n>  \n>The JSF joint Operational Requirements Document (ORD)  \nand the Joint Model Specification (JMS) provides guidance to  \nthe JSF prime Contractor for conducting JSF EMD Phase  \nefforts. **Any changes to those documents which affect the**  \n**STOVL variant will be jointly approved by the U.S. DoD and**  \n**U.K. MOD.** The U.K. MOD will also participate in the change  \ncontrol and approval process for the Contract Specification\n\nSo, it seems that as far as the STOVL variant was concerned, the UK was a major participant. They contributed 8-10% of the funds and 10 people, contributed requirements and KPPs, had a say on the selection of LM over Boeing, and approval on requirement changes to STOVL. I imagine the USMC largely welcomed the political and financial support to keep the F35B variant from being cancelled (as many, many people seem to have called for repeatedly).\n\nSpeculating on what unique UK requirements may be, we could make an informed guess that some of them may be around ski-jump operation, as that isn't something the USMC use.",
