        "body": "I collected the datas on the numerical extent, in terms of personnel and equipment, of the \"Groups of Forces\" on which the operational and strategic management of the Russian grouping deployed in Ukraine is organized. \n\nThese are estimates released at different times over the past month and a half by the Ukrainian military observers Mashovets and Kovalenko, thanks to their contacts with Ukrainian military intelligence. These figures aren\u2019t to be taken literally, but as estimates. They are not fully up-to-date, but they are still a very good way to understand how these GoFs are ranked in terms of strength. I also made a [chart]( https://i.imgur.com/8tZfono.png), from DeepState\u2019s map, to show the territory of jurisdiction of each GoF (the GoFs \"Bryansk\" and \"Kursk\" aren't shown).\n\n\nGroup of Forces | Personnel | MBTs | IFVs, APCs & IMVs | Artillery guns \u2265 100mm | MLRS\n:-------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:---------:\nBryansk + Kursk | 16,500 | 80 | 220 | 320 | 20\nBelgorod | 17,700 | 110 | 361 | 415 | 38\nWest (Zapad) | 80,000 | 1,112 | 1,840 | 790 | 280\nSouth (Yug) | 110,000 | 400 | 1,600 | 1,150 | 300\nCentre (Tsentr) | 87,000 | 386 | 774 | 832 | 212\nEast (Vostok) | 52,000 | 400 | 800 | 310 | 100\nDnepr | 130,000 | 670 | 1,950 | 900 | 200\n\n\nThese figures exclude the strategic-operational reserves (about 60 thousad men, with their equipment), the Rosgvardia grouping in the rear of the front (about 35 thousand men, with their equipment, including artillery and even tanks, in the case of the new 116th Special Purpose Brigade), and the small GoF \u201cCrimea\u201d (about 13 thousand men, with a few tanks and around 80 armored vehicles). \n\nThe GoFs generally match the military districts, although this is not always the case. Excluding the GoFs located along the state border (\u201cBryansk\u201d, \u201cKursk\u201d, \u201cBelgorod\u201d), we have, firstly, the GoF \u201cWest\u201d. It corresponds to virtually all of the former Western Military District (now divided between Moscow and Leningrad MDs) - except for a few minor elements of these districts that are located along the state border. In fact, it consists of the: 1st GTA (MMD), 6th CAA (LMD), 20th CAA (MMD), the 11th Corps of the Baltic Fleet as well as the 25th CAA and the elements of the 201st Military Base that are deployed to the front, actually both being part of the Central MD. It appears that since early March, with the transfer of the remaining elements of the 41st CAA and of the 90th Tank Division (both CMD) to Avdiivka, the jurisdiction over the Kreminna sector, including over the Serebrianka Forest, was highly likely transferred to the GoF \u201cWest\u201d, which has thus incorporated the 25th CAA. The very high number of tanks is related to the presence of many tank units/formations within this group: the 4th Tank Division and the 47th Tank Division of the 1st GTA (the latter has two motorized regiments and two tank ones, with the arrival, last October, of the new, fully equipped 153rd Tank Regiment), as well as the 11th Tank Brigade of the 25th CAA, to which we must add the tank regiments of the motorized divisions and the tank battalions of the motorized brigades and regiments. \n\nThe Siversky Donets River represents the beginning of the jurisdiction of the GoF \u201cSouth\u201d, which includes a very considerable part of the Southern Military District.\n\nThis GoF encompasses the central/northern part of the Siversk salient too, once under the jurisdiction of the GoF \u201cCentre\u201d, which was moved to the Avdiivka and Horlivka sectors, that have passed to the jurisdiction of the latter GoF during January, when the command of the offensive operations in Avdiivka passed from Rostov-on-Don (Kuzovlev) to Yekaterimburg (Mordvichev). \n\nLet\u2019s note that the GoF \u201cSouth\u201d still retains jurisdiction over the Marinka sector, from Krasnohorivka (the one north of Marinka) to Solodke. Indeed, in the bulletins of the Russian MoD, the spokesman of this GoF often mentions Bilohorivka (the one near the Siversky Donets) and Novomykhailivka in the same bulletin.\n\nThe \u201cGoF\u201d South contains most of the 8th CAA - including its two motorized divisions, all of its 2nd Corps and part of the 1st Corps. This GoF also includes the 3rd Corps, whose formal affiliation is unclear: it was stated to be part of the 20th CAA, but Russian rumors said that since last summer it has been part of the Southern MD), as well as the 68th Corps of the Eastern MD and the 155th Naval Infantry Brigade, which are fighting in the Marinka sector. It also includes the 98th and 106th VDV Divisions, as well as the 11th and 83rd VDV Brigades and the 177th Naval Infantry Regiment, along with part of the 14th Corps of the Arctic Fleet; in addition to the bulk of the Cossack Volunteer Assault Corps. Most of this GoF is concentrated around Bakhmut. \n\nBetween Mayorsk and Shumy the jurisdiction of the GoF \u201cCentre\u201d begins, which corresponds to the Central Military District (except the 25th CAA): the 2nd CAA, the 41st CAA and the 90th Tank Division. This GoF also includes the bulk of the 1st Corps of the 8th CAA. The jurisdiction of this GoF extends as far as Nevelske. This group has the worst equipment to personnel ratio, due to the very high gear losses during the Avdiivka offensive, the fact that many units of the 1st Corps and of the Territorial Forces are rifle ones, and the fact that the 90th Tank Division is not fully equipped (otherwise it should have 300+ tanks). \n\nRemembering that the Marinka sector is in the hands of the GoF \u201cSouth\u201d, in Volodymyrivka the jurisdiction of the GoF \u201cEast\u201d begins, which reaches as far as the Konka River between Orikhiv and Polohy. This GoF corresponds to almost the entire Eastern Military District and was joined by the 35th CAA in February, with the dissolution of the GoF \"Zaporizhzhia\", that was incorporated into the GoF \u201cEast\u201d (the Polohy sector) and the GoF \u201cDnepr\u201d (the Kamianske and Orikhiv sectors). The GoF \u201cEast\u201d includes the 35th CAA, 5th CAA, 36th CAA and 29th CAA, as well as the 40th and 336th Naval Infantry Brigades and the 34th Mountain Brigade of the 49th CAA (SMD). This GoF is also marked by a high number of tanks compared to the personnel, which is due to the presence of the 5th Tank Brigade (36th CAA), which alone has a hundred MBTs.\n\nThe jurisdiction of the GoF \u201cDnepr\u201d, which became the largest after the merger of the bulk of the GoF \u201cZaporizhzhia\u201d with the old GoF \u201cDnepr\u201d, begins in Novopokrovka. It covers the entire rest of the front until the mouth of the Dnipro River. It should be split between 55% of its forces in Kherson Oblast and 45% in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, more or less. It corresponds practically to the rest of the Southern Military District: the 58th CAA and the 18th CAA, which are both very large. It also includes elements of the 49th CAA, which, however, is split: the 34th Mountain Brigade in Velyka Novosilka, the 7th Military Base (or at least most of it) in Bakhmut, with some rumors of elements of this army along the state border in Belgorod. The 205th Motorized Brigade should still be in the R&R in Crimea and be part of the strategic reserve. This GoF also includes the other part of the 14th Corps of the Arctic Fleet; the 7th, 76th and 104th VDV Divisions, the 810th and 61st Naval Infantry Brigades, as well as some elements of the Cossack Volunteer Assault Corps.",

As for the Ukrainians, it appears that the 68th Jager Brigade, or at least elements of it, have been transferred over the past week to the Tonenke/Umanske area (Avdiivka) from the Svatove sector, and it\u2019s also confirmed that the 78th Air Assault Regiment has been transferred to the same area (from the Orikhiv sector), in support of the 25th Airborne Brigade and the 53rd Mech Brigade. The Russian MoD already had begun mentioning the 68th Jager Brigade as being in this sector since March 31. The 3rd Assault Brigade, around Semenivka, is supported by the 61st Mech Brigade and by elements of the 109th and 120th TDF Brigades; the 47th Mech Brigade, around Berdychi, by elements of the 31st Mech Brigade and of the 143rd and 144th Infantry Brigades. \n\nThe 67th Mechanized Brigade has been transferred to the Bakhmut sector (just before Chasiv Yar). It\u2019s a good brigade (although it lost, in January, a couple of companies of the \"Da Vinci's Wolves\", that refounded the battalion inside the 59th Motorized Brigade), which has been given a very difficult task: stemming the advances of the 98th VDV Division between Bohdanivka and Ivanivske in the direction of Chasiv Yar, with the Russians that have recently come very close to its \u201cKanal\u201d district (on the eastern bank of the Donets-Donbas Canal). The 67th Brigade was transferred from the Kupyansk (Tabaivka) and Kreminna (Serebrianka Forest) sectors. In the first sector it had halted the Russian breakthrough in Tabaivka, along with elements of the 1st Special Purpose Brigade \u201cIvan Bohun\u201d and the 103rd TDF Brigade. Today it seems to have been replaced by the 17th Battalion of the 57th Motorized Brigade and by elements of the 3rd Tank Brigade, both of which were already in the Kupyansk sector; while the 108th Battalion of the 10th Mountain Assault Brigade arrived in Synkivka from the area around Ivanivka, in both cases inside the Kupyansk sector. In the Kreminna sector it should have been replaced by the \"Khartiia\" Brigade of the National Guard. Moreover, it appears that the 77th Airmobile Brigade has been transferred from the northern flank of Bakhmut to the Svatove sector, possibly replacing the 25th Airborne Brigade. In the northern flank of Bakhmut, battalions of the 142nd Infantry Brigade have been deployed in Bohdanivka and in Rozdolivka. The bulk of the 141st Infantry Brigade is committed in the Orikhiv sector, where it was joined by elements of the new 5th Tank Brigade.\n\nA small expansion of the National Guard continues: the 11th Separate Battalion [has been reformed](https://militaryland.net/news/national-guards-unit-3051-expands-to-a-regiment) as the 35th Regiment, with the creation of an additional battalion and a reconnaissance company, along with the supply of BTR-4s and Roshel Senator MRAPs. I had heard a mention of this regiment last month, but had found no evidence that it existed, until MilitaryLand confirmed it. It\u2019s covering the state border along Sumy Oblast. The \u201cAzov\u201d Brigade of the National Guard, which has many demands to join it, recently created the 6th Special Purpose Battalion, \n\nThe 2nd Mech Battalion of the 93rd Mechanized Brigade arrived around a month ago in the Terny area (Kreminna sector) - despite the fact that the bulk of the brigade is already very busy around Bakhmut - joining the large Ukrainian grouping that is halting the Russian offensive in the direction of Terny and Yampolivka. These villages are being attacked by practically two reinforced Russian divisions: respectively the 144th Motorized Division of the 20th CAA, that was joined, in mid March, by the 252nd Motorized Regiment of the 3rd Motorized Division (20th CAA), and the 67th Motorized Division of the 25th CAA, reinforced by several battalions of the divisions of the 1st GTA. \n\nThat said, analyzing Russian social media, I come across more and more cases of servicemen of the 67th Motorized Division which are listed as MIA in the Avdiivka sector. There are men belonging to the 31st and 36th Motorized Regiments as well as the 19th Tank Regiment of this division who are reported missing there. This is in addition to what Tatarigami said in February, i.e. that the 2nd CAA and the 41st CAA had received armored vehicles from the 25th CAA to replenish their equipment losses (there was later evidence of this). Now I don\u2019t know whether the assault detachments of these units were sent to Avdiivka, whether other small elements were transferred to this sector, whether some men from these units were transferred to the units of the Central MD deployed in the Avdiivka sector to replenish their losses, if not to other units (one woman wrote that her missing husband and other men were detached from the 19th Tank Regiment to the 114th Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps). We shall see how that develops. Also, it seems that many smaller units of the 1st Corps have been cannibalized or are anyway used as marching units to replenish the others. Let\u2019s recall that during the summer the 1st Corps had several regiments deployed along the Southern front as a reinforcement for other formations against the Ukrainian counteroffensive; today it\u2019s conceivable that their presence has been scaled back. In another case, a man from the 95th Rifle Regiment of 1st Corps (which was in Kherson) was reported missing in the Vuhledar sector, where in theory the 116th Rifle Regiment of 1st Corps is present. Other units such as the 96th and 98th Rifle Regiments of the 1st Corps are being used as marching units for the other units active in Avdiivka. The same is true for the regiments of the Territorial Forces, of which there are many in Avdiivka: for instance, I read that the 1231st Regiment from Kazan (Tatarstan) had very large losses and was disbanded, with the men sent to the other units around Avdiivka; the 1232nd Regiment, again made up of mobilized residents of Tatarstan, also had major losses and the men were used as replacements for the brigades of the 2nd CAA.",

        "body": "MilitaryLand [reports](https://militaryland.net/news/153rd-mechanized-brigade-is-no-longer-mechanized) that the 153rd Mechanized Brigade, one of five mechanized brigades created in October 2023, has been reformed as the 153rd Infantry Brigade, and there are rumors that the 152nd Mechanized Brigade will also have the same fate.\n\nInterestingly, this is happening despite the fact that Ukraine reformed the 100th TDF Brigade as the 100th Mechanized Brigade just a few days ago. So the reasons could be both a shortage of vehicles and a willingness to give them to existing units that have proven to deserve them. It should also be said that in a defensive posture, an infantry brigade with no or poor mechanized capabilities can still do much, unlike when in offense. \n\nIn general, the situation for vehicles in Ukraine is not extremely bad, meaning there is a shortage, but it's not one of the priorities compared to shells or manpower. But it's not rosy either, and the vehicles received from partners and those recovered from depots probably cover the losses, but are unlikely to allow the mechanization of new units. \n\nThe 150th Mech Brigade was seen in training with BRDM-2s, the 151st Mech Brigade with BMP-1s (actually the standard in many brigades), the 154th Mech Brigade with BMP-1s and even with a captured T-62M. \n\nUkrainian stocks of T-64BVs proved to be much deeper than expected, due to the fact that those in storage were really a lot. Incoming Leopard 1A5s will support the situation, although there is also a need to replenish the losses of the existing fleet of MBTs. \n\nUntil there are large new transfers from partners, the situation will also remain delicate regarding IFVs, both Western and Soviet ones. There are still many IFVs in service, but I think it's very difficult to equip new units with them. Also, there is no longer the huge number of vehicles captured from the Russians like back in 2022.\n\nRegarding APCs, the situation seems to be better, but they also include those such as the BTR-60. In March, the 425th Separate Assault Battalion \"Skala\" received the first M117s delivered from the US - hopefully the rest (250 units were pledged) will arrive as soon as possible. Moreover, M113s are always appreciated and in huge demand by the Ukrainians. \n\nAdditional MRAPs, those weighing around or over 10 tons, are also needed. As for IMVs, Ukraine has many, and many more have been pledged - they are great vehicles if the alternative is a civilian car, but some of them aren't able to withstand a TM-62 mine and are too lightly armored to be supplied to mechanized units; they are given mainly to the National Guard and the Border Guards and/or used for CASEVAC. \n\nAs for artillery, many newly made 155mm howitzers are expected to arrive from France and Germany in 2024 and 2025, and the production pace of the domestic 155mm SPG (2S22 Bohdana), has increased to 8 units per month. The former Warsaw Pact countries still have many 2S1 Gvozdikas, which are useful for Ukraine given the decent availability of 122mm shells.",

But it&#39;s not rosy either, and the vehicles received from partners and those recovered from depots probably cover the losses, but are unlikely to allow the mechanization of new units. </p>\n\n<p>The 150th Mech Brigade was seen in training with BRDM-2s, the 151st Mech Brigade with BMP-1s (actually the standard in many brigades), the 154th Mech Brigade with BMP-1s and even with a captured T-62M. </p>\n\n<p>Ukrainian stocks of T-64BVs proved to be much deeper than expected, due to the fact that those in storage were really a lot. Incoming Leopard 1A5s will support the situation, although there is also a need to replenish the losses of the existing fleet of MBTs. </p>\n\n<p>Until there are large new transfers from partners, the situation will also remain delicate regarding IFVs, both Western and Soviet ones. There are still many IFVs in service, but I think it&#39;s very difficult to equip new units with them. Also, there is no longer the huge number of vehicles captured from the Russians like back in 2022.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding APCs, the situation seems to be better, but they also include those such as the BTR-60. In March, the 425th Separate Assault Battalion &quot;Skala&quot; received the first M117s delivered from the US - hopefully the rest (250 units were pledged) will arrive as soon as possible. Moreover, M113s are always appreciated and in huge demand by the Ukrainians. </p>\n\n<p>Additional MRAPs, those weighing around or over 10 tons, are also needed. As for IMVs, Ukraine has many, and many more have been pledged - they are great vehicles if the alternative is a civilian car, but some of them aren&#39;t able to withstand a TM-62 mine and are too lightly armored to be supplied to mechanized units; they are given mainly to the National Guard and the Border Guards and/or used for CASEVAC. </p>\n\n<p>As for artillery, many newly made 155mm howitzers are expected to arrive from France and Germany in 2024 and 2025, and the production pace of the domestic 155mm SPG (2S22 Bohdana), has increased to 8 units per month. The former Warsaw Pact countries still have many 2S1 Gvozdikas, which are useful for Ukraine given the decent availability of 122mm shells.</p>\n</div>",

Ukraine operates a similar caliber Soviet-era 2S7 Pion howitzer. Ukrainian gunners value the weapon for its long range and accuracy. According to Ukrainian news reports, US-made 203mm shells can be fired from the Ukrainian Pion howitzers.*\n\n*The iEidiseis reports that Greek ammo dumps contain 175mm shells in \u201chuge quantities\u201d and that the munition would become part of the ammunition delivery to Ukraine, the report says.*\n\n*According to the Netherlands-based tracking site Oryx, Ukraine has never received artillery systems capable of firing the American 1960s-era 175mm heavy shell. The iEidiseis report said that \u201ca small number of 175mm cannon remain in service\u201d in the Greek military, but \u201cmany systems require maintenance.\u201d*\n\n*The total value of Greek ammunition and equipment to be transferred to Ukraine, idEdiseis reported, would be equivalent to $185 million, some $29 million more than the expected price of shells to be sold by Greece to the Czech purchasing cooperative, per reports in Doureios and other European major media.*\n\n*Prague officials in early March called on nations supporting Ukraine to pool resources and help finance a Czech-led worldwide search for artillery shells to send to Kyiv.*\n\n*By early April more than 15 countries had promised $1.9 billion, slightly more than double Prague\u2019s initial request for $800 million to purchase 500,000 155-mm NATO-standard artillery shells and 300,000 Soviet-standard 122mm shells abroad.*\n\n*Germany is the largest contributor, with Berlin officials over April 1-2 announcing Berlin will fund 40 percent of all ammunition purchased by the Czech-led cooperative, and promising to donate 180,000 shells made by Germany\u2019s Rheinmetall.*\n\n*Other major supporters of the initiative having made public the value of planned contributions include Belgium ($215 million), the Netherlands ($165 million) and Norway ($153 million).

Rising demand combined with limited increased production capacity has spiked the price of a single 155mm artillery shell in world markets to about $2,200 each, he said.*\n\n*Pevkur predicted that by the end of 2024 European production would grow to 1.4 million shells, and by the end of 2025 the figure would rise to two million shells a year, or about 80 percent of Ukraine\u2019s annual battle needs.*\n\n*In Europe, the German defense giant Rheinmetall has announced plans to produce 700,00 shells annually by the end of 2024 and \u2013 with the start-up of new factories planned in Germany, Ukraine and Lithuania \u2013 to produce more than a million artillery shells annually by 2027. Governments in Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and Norway also have announced the intention to expand artillery shell production.*\n\n*According to the Ukrainian military information publication armyrecognition.com, hard-pressed Pentagon logistics commanders charged to maintain US stocks, provide artillery ammunition to Israel, and keep a White House promise to support Ukraine \u201cas long as it takes\u201d in the face of Congressional refusal to pay for it, have turned to manufacturers in T\u00fcrkiye to forestall looming American 155mm shell deficits.*\n\n*The article names the Turkish state company Roketsan and the Turkish government research agency Tubitak as Ankara\u2019s main producers currently filling American shell orders.*\n\n*The United States in recent months has already purchased 116,000 artillery shells \u201cfrom a Turkish company, with prospects for additional purchases,\u201d as well as trinitrotoluene (TNT) and nitroguanidine, the key chemicals for shell explosives and propellant, the report says.*\n\n*The US-Turkish ammunition collaboration project will see heavy Turkish investment in American shell manufacturing, and the Turkish company Rekon will, by 2025, have built three new production lines in Texas, manufacturing about 30 percent of all 155mm artillery shells produced in the United States, the report says.*\n\n*Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his American counterpart Joe Biden are scheduled to meet at the White House on May 9.

Multiple Ukrainian manufacturers and civil volunteers, such as former President Poroshenko, switched to developing EW systems to protect the military from Russian drone attacks.*\n\n*Poroshenko\u2019s investment of over 150 million hryvnias ($3.8+ million) in November of the previous year has accelerated the development of the \u201cAi-Petri SV\u201d project. Despite the usual timeframe of 3 to 8 years for developing such complex systems, the team managed to complete it in under 5 months. This rapid development was due to the urgent demand from the military, as evidenced by the numerous orders already placed for the system.*\n\n*During the presentation, five \u201cAi-Petri SV\u201d systems were handed over to the crews of Ukraine\u2019s 18th Counter-Technical Intelligence Center. These units are now undergoing extensive training to master the operation of these sophisticated systems before being deployed to the front lines.*\n\n*The \u201cAi-Petri SV\u201d system boasts a range of claimed capabilities that make it a formidable tool in electronic warfare. In addition to its basic function of suppressing communication, it can detect the positions of Russian UAV operators, disorient FPV drones, and even interfere with the operation of Russian-guided aerial glide bombs, the usage of which the russian forces have significantly intensified in recent months. Poroshenko says the first Ai-Petris are already operational in the Avdiivka direction, Donetsk Oblast, where they are protecting the lives of artillery personnel.*\n\n*The system comprises a radio-electronic warfare station, a modern radar station, and an anti-drone device, as per the ex-President. It also includes pickups, a command and staff vehicle mounted on a truck chassis, secure communication means, and a power source. Poroshenko has stated that the system could \u201csuppress\u201d Russian UAVs at distances of up to 20 kilometers.*\n\n*Militarnyi notes that an intriguing aspect of the \u201cAi-Petri SV\u201d system is an unknown optical device shown in a video alongside the conventional antenna system. This device, pointing in the same direction as the antennas, could be an observation device or a laser station. This aligns with Poroshenko\u2019s past statement about the system\u2019s ability to blind Russia\u2019s Zala and Orlan UAVs, suggesting the possible use of laser emitters capable of blinding the optical devices of Russian drones.*\n\n*The development of this technology has been ongoing for some time, with a secretive company within Ukraine\u2019s defense-industrial complex, which has been producing EW systems since 2014, working on the project. The \u201cAi-Petri SV\u201d system represents a significant step forward in Ukraine\u2019s electronic warfare capabilities, showcasing the country\u2019s engineering prowess and commitment to defending against modern threats.*",

As another commenter noted, the models are generally opaque, which makes identifying potential biases difficult or even impossible in some instances.\n\nFrom an intel perspective that's *highly* problematic since it directly impacts your ability to ascribe confidence levels to your determinations (or sets them all to \"low\" without significant additional analysis, which would undermine much of the purpose of their use). An analyst will generally also want to delineate potential biases or uncertainties to decision makers to contextualize the analysis.

And I stand by what I did. You click the link, and the Middle East Monitor presents the instagram post in a dry and factual fashion. There is no comment either on the veracity or anything else. That was a small part of my post that was focused on an article from the Guardian showcasing the horrific stories of children killed and maimed by Sniper fire.\n\nNote that neither did I nor the sources I presented claim that the IDF is factually responsible for deliberately murdering Children in Gaza. Instead I presented factual evidence of:\n\n- Children being hit by Sniper fire in Gaza\n- An IDF soldier gloating (unknown if he is telling the truth or not) about having murdered children/looking for children to murder.\n- Extremely lax or borderline egregious ROE by the IDF (the World Kitchen episode. I could also have posted about the earlier episode of the IDF hunting and shooting their own hostages).\n\nEach one of the participants of this forum is then left to take their own conclusions.\n\nSo yes, I believe quoting the Middle East Monitor in this specific context is perfectly in line with the credibility standards of this forum. If any mod could chime in and provide its own assessment, I would be grateful as well.\n\nAs a side remark, I would appreciate that you would rather focus on attacking my ideas rather than attacking the person.

In what universe is a UN brokered ceasefire a military defeat? Also, another example of Israel bowing to international pressure, <em>not</em> sanctions.</p>\n</div>",

I believe Macron is floating this idea right now. </p>\n\n<p>Now it wouldn&#39;t be a quick desert storm type of winning, like it would if NATO air got involved. It would work to grind down Russian capability in an attrition fight. Attrition fights are won on the margins though.</p>\n</div>",

Putin has committed to the war, and his name is directly attached to it, but an ultimate failure in Ukraine may not even result in the end of his powers. It's not certain that a victory for Ukraine would inevitably be considered an unacceptable failure in Russia-- depending what it looked like. Even if it were an unacceptable failure, it's not certain this would destroy Putin's regime.\n\nAny sort of nuclear escalation is more likely to end Putin's regime and Russia as a whole than any kind of defeat in Ukraine. Something like the Gulf War where a coalition doesn't seek regime change but territory liberation would not necessitate a nuclear response even if you believe Putin is believes he must and is willing to use nukes to survive. Direct intervention with a nuclear armed state will always increase the risk of a nuclear exchange. It is a risk worth considering.

            "body": "In short, the world is in a new Cold War. U/app_priori gives a detailed explanation of which I agree heavily with the first part. \n\nMy perspective is from a pro-US point of view, so to share a few of my thoughts:\n\n1. The US image and foreign policy still live in the shadow of the Iraq War consequences. WMDs justificacition was a colossal blunder proper of the history books. We all know how it ended. Imagine a world where the US never invaded Iraq in 2003...\n\n\n2. Crimea annexation was the first direct hit from another actor to the US led international order. A pure land grab. \n\n\n3.
