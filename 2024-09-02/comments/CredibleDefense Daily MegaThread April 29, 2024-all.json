As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

        "body": "Quick update on the tactical situation of the front in Ukraine over the past few days. The most negative development is that last night DeepState confirmed Russian control over Hill 245. I had written about the importance of the heights around Ocheteryne, and Hill 245 represents the highest point along the watershed that passes through the hills in that area. It is, as I indicated [here](https://i.imgur.com/TOzVuBh.jpeg) thanks to Google Earth Pro, the highest elevation in a 23 kms radius (down to the heights just south of Avdiivka), excluding a couple of artificial \"Terrikons\" east of Selydove. As a result of gaining such heights, the Russians have several options: threatening the entire area between Vovcha and Durna to the south; moving in the direction of Prohres/Hrodivka along the Avdiivka-Pokrovsk railway (the quickest route to Pokrovsk); moving in the direction of Nova Poltavka, aiming to cut the T0504 Highway; and moving north along the valley of the Kalynivka in the direction of Toretsk. The last option is the most complicated but also the least considered, except e.g. by the Ukrainian observer Mashovets, who for weeks and weeks has been placing his attention on Toretsk, especially if the Russians manage to record successes on the southern flank of Bakhmut.\n\nThe situation is very complicated. There's no proper breakthrough, but there's no stabilization in sight either. The Russians in recent days have been moving in the direction of Novooleksandrivka, getting about 1,5 km from this village. To the south of this village, around the railway, there should be a major Ukrainian trench system, according to satellite datas collected by Cl\u00e9ment Molin, which is part of the defense line passing along the Vovcha River. There are also some Russian advances in the direction of Arkhanhelske, even though the fighting should still be going on in the area near the pond to the north-east of Ocheteryne. The problem is that Arkhanhelske will also be threatened from the south-east, thanks to Russian advances in Keramik, where they are flanking the village, capturing the area of the pond to the north-east of Keramik. The Ukrainians hold positions in the western part of Novokalynove and the trench system around Hill 232, but it's difficult to say how long they will hold. \n\nIn terms of order of battle, the situation hasn't changed from what I had written last week. Virtually the entire 2nd CAA and 41st CAA (except the 137th Motorized Brigade, which is being refitted after the battles in Berdychi back in March) are deployed around Ocheretyne, Soloviove and Berdychi, along with the regiments of the Territorial Forces attached to them. The 132nd Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps is active in Keramik while the 114th Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps in Semenivka. Recently I found out this brigade had replenishments from the 365th Regiment of the Territorial Forces (too), active in Kherson. As for the Ukrainians, several rifle battalions have recently arrived as reinforcements, particularly from the 142nd and 144th Infantry Brigades (the battalions of the infantry brigades often fight in different sectors, although recently a soldier from the 142nd Infantry Brigade in a crowdfunding post stated that the brigade is active in the Avdiivka sector), as well as territorial defense battalions (e.g. the 167th Battalion of the 119th TDF Brigade, along with individual battalions of several other TDF brigades).\n\nAfter attempting a counterattack between Berdychi and Semenivka, the 47th Mechanized Brigade has left the Berdychi area, with the Russians occupying the western end of the village; they are also moving westwards from Semenivka, occupying the trenches immediately west of the last village. It's possible that the next few days might see a rapid advance in the direction of Novoselivka Persha and Umanske. We have yet to have geolocations confirming this or updates from DeepState, but the Ukrainian observer Miroshnykov wrote that the Russians have already approached Novopokrovske (in the direction of Novoselivka Persha) and advanced south of Soloviove (in both cases by several hundred meters), as well as entered Umanske (I assume in the part south of the Durna), where there are clashes ongoing; also, they should be about 1 km from the Umanske-Netailove Road. \n\nIn Netailove, the Russians (9th Motorized Brigade of 1st Corps) managed to penetrate the village and seize the eastern part. The Ukrainians (59th Motorized Brigade) likely retreated to the area of the multi-story buildings around the secondary school. The Russians are also very active around Nevelske, which they are trying to flank from the north by attacking from the orchards to the south of Pervomaiske, where intense fighting is going on, but without success for the Russians. This area, down to Krasnohorivka, is to be watched very carefully. There is very heavy fighting in the area of the large brick factory in Krasnohorivka. The Russians (5th Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps) had managed to capture the southern part of the industrial complex but were later pushed back. In recent days they have been concentrating on flanking both the factory and the whole town: Russian assault groups managed to reach Radyanska Street at the intersection with Heolohichna Street, and this morning they seized the \u201chunter's house\u201d to the north-east of the town, and presumably the trenches around it (just north of the Lozova River - likely the work of the 110th Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps, which is also active in Nevelske), endangering the hold of the other Ukrainian fortifications east of the town, which is defended by elements of the 80th Air Assault Brigade and elements of the 109th and 111th TDF Brigades. \n\nBriefly on the high sectors. Kupyansk. Per Russian sources, the Ukrainians have carried out small counterattacks north of Synkivka, and the Russians have abandoned their positions on the gates of the village, retreating into the woods north of the village. However, in recent days the Russians have occupied almost all of Kyslivka, and are now attacking Kotlyarivka. This is a negative development as these villages are situated on high ground, through control of which the Ukrainians had been able to halt the Russians after the January breakthrough around Tabaivka. A good chunk of the 47th Tank Division of the 1st GTA has been concentrated to attack in this area, which is defended by the 103rd TDF Brigade, elements of the 104th TDF Brigade and of the 3rd Tank Brigade; the 34th Motorized Battalion of the 57th Motorized Brigade arrived these days from Synkivka to join the 17th Motorized Battalion of the same brigade in this area. Elements of the 2nd Motorized Division of the 1st GTA are instead attacking south of this salient created in January, towards Berestove, against the positions of the Ukrainian 77th Airmobile Brigade, without success. \n\nKreminna. Fierce battles continue near Terny and Yampolivka, but there is no Russian advance, despite the numerosity of their grouping here. It's possible that some elements of the Ukrainian 3rd Assault Brigade were redeployed in this area.\n\nSiversk. The Ukrainian 81st Airmobile Brigade managed to halt the progress of the 7th Motorized Brigade of the 2nd Corps around the chalk quarry, recapturing a trench north-east of the quarry and holding their positions on top of the quarry.\n\nBakhmut. Over the past 10 days the situation has stabilized - the Russians are probably accumulating men and gear, and at the moment the feared large mechanized attack the Ukrainians expected south of the Kanal District hasn't occurred. The 41st Mechanized Brigade (supported by the 67th Mechanized Brigade and TDF elements, including a recently arrived battalion of the 111th TDF Brigade) and the 5th Assault Brigade are defending the Kanal District and the area around it, against attacks by the 98th VDV Division and the 11th VDV Brigade, which are supported by elements of the Cossack Volunteer Assault Corps. According to Russian sources, over the recent days the Ukrainians have recaptured the buildings east of the intersection of Zelena Street with Horbatoho Street. We can safely say that the Russians don't control any building of Chasiv Yar. The Kanal District holds - in the last week the well-known Special Detachment \u201cKraken\u201d of the HUR arrived in this area. It should be mentioned, however, that Russian forward positions inside the forest in the nature reserve area south of District Kanal are close to the Donets-Donbas Canal, and the Russians might have recently taken the remaining part of Ivanivske. No progress is reported in the direction of Kalinina. The Russians attempted attacks against Andriivka and Kurdyumovka, all of which were repulsed by the 92nd Assault Brigade and the 28th Mechanized Brigade.\n\nMarinka. The Russians are consolidating their gains around Novomykhailivka, with the probable aim of attacking Paraskoviivka, but there is no serious activity against this village yet. The observer Mashovets reported that the 3rd Motorized Battalion of the 144th Motorized Brigade of the 40th Corps of the 18th CAA (the brigade is active near Krynky in the Kherson sector) has been moved to this area to reinforce the grouping of the Group of Forces \"South\" active here.\n\nVuhledar. There is increasing Russian activity, both from Volodymyrivka and Mykilske, by the 36th Motorized Brigade of the 29th CAA. No successes are noted, however, thanks to the work of the 72nd Mechanized Brigade. \n\nVelyka Novosilka. The 37th Motorized Brigade of the 36th CAA advanced a few hundred meters towards Urozhaine, arriving at the gates of the village (defended, mainly, by the 58th Motorized Brigade), but we are talking about minor stuff. \n\nNothing to say elsewhere, except that it appears that the Ukrainians managed to slightly expand the territory they controll in Krynky (around the museum), and Syrsky claimed that the Ukrainians took control of Nestryha Island, at the mouth of the Dnipro.",

They did not respond to specific questions nor did they provide evidence showing why the buildings we highlighted were demolished.

You kill its leaders, you kill its members and you make sure its infrastructure is completely destroyed. Maybe you can squeeze a few years out before you have to fight the next round.

Israel needs to get the hostages out and Israel will only get the hostages out by accepting Hamas demands which boil down to two points: Clear out the prisons of Palestinians terrorists, stop military operations in Gaza. And on the political front nothing will happen anyway. You can't tell the Israeli electorate that they should accept a Palestinian state after they massacred 1.200 Israelis and got away with it.

He merely ponders that BECAUSE the war is fundamentally not about territory, it depends on THE WAY Ukraine loses the Donetsk (if that even happens). The implication here is that if Ukrainian front completely and utterly collapses then it cannot be ruled out that Russia continues their advance up to the Dnipro river, but if it's just a gradual phasing out, then maybe Russia will allow for the freezing of the conflict after achieving their minimal stated goals of capturing the Donbass.
