If that had been allowed to continue there's no way they would have thrown their lot in with Russia.\n\nEdit: apparently this is 'low quality' so let me expand a bit - negotiations and relations between Iran and the west improved through the 2000s and 2010s and resulted in the JCPOA which was essentially \"you stop developing nuclear tech and we'll ease up on the sanctions and bring you back towards a normal trading relationship\". If Iran was still in that mechanism in 2022, the threat of sanctions would have been a really easy lever to use to prevent Iran from helping (sanctioned) Russia in Ukraine.\n\nBut because the US pulled out of that deal and re-applied sanctions, Iran decided that the political and diplomatic benefits of the deal with the EU wasn't worth it, and looked for another way to strengthen its position geopolitically.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>It&#39;s a real shame that Trump-era US pulled out of normalising relations with Iran - European countries were making quite a lot of progress in bringing them into a neutral, respectable position (similar to a lot of other countries in the region). If that had been allowed to continue there&#39;s no way they would have thrown their lot in with Russia.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: apparently this is &#39;low quality&#39; so let me expand a bit - negotiations and relations between Iran and the west improved through the 2000s and 2010s and resulted in the JCPOA which was essentially &quot;you stop developing nuclear tech and we&#39;ll ease up on the sanctions and bring you back towards a normal trading relationship&quot;. If Iran was still in that mechanism in 2022, the threat of sanctions would have been a really easy lever to use to prevent Iran from helping (sanctioned) Russia in Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>But because the US pulled out of that deal and re-applied sanctions, Iran decided that the political and diplomatic benefits of the deal with the EU wasn&#39;t worth it, and looked for another way to strengthen its position geopolitically. And that meant that when Russia came calling, they were more willing to go that way. And since Iran is still sanctioned by the US, there&#39;s no leverage to apply to prevent them from becoming a full blown Russian ally if they want.</p>\n</div>",

We are not hosting Chinese Military bases or Russian ones, so why is the US trying to cause problems? Even the EU just makes some lip service comments on the elections and moves on. Even India had to interfere and tell the US to tone down their anti Bangladesh rhetoric. What did it acheive? Nothing and it only pushed us closer to China and Russia.\n\nOur population have a potive outlook on the West and Western nations, we have abided by the rules of Pax Americana.

Indian intelligence heads praise Bangladesh for our role in helping eliminate insurgents in North East India and India is working with us to help develop the economy of the North East.</p>\n\n<p>Sure our elections arent the fairest and our prime minister is a quasi dictator, but things are stable and there are no active conflicts or massacres and genocides and terror promotion going on. There is absolutely no reason for the US to try to antagonize us. Bu they cant help themselves. They have to denounce our government, sanction people and try to create a negative outlook economically for us using these methods.</p>\n\n<p>My question is why??? Dont you have enough on your plates already?? We dont care what goes on inside your borders and we dont create trouble outside of ours. We are not hosting Chinese Military bases or Russian ones, so why is the US trying to cause problems? Even the EU just makes some lip service comments on the elections and moves on. Even India had to interfere and tell the US to tone down their anti Bangladesh rhetoric. What did it acheive? Nothing and it only pushed us closer to China and Russia.</p>\n\n<p>Our population have a potive outlook on the West and Western nations, we have abided by the rules of Pax Americana. Yet we are punished when worse countries get a free pass and this creates unnecessary anti wester sentiments.</p>\n</div>",

But I do care when their annoyance at her leads to the detriment of our economy and security apparatus.\n\nFor all the critcisms of Hasina, its been under her that we made the greatest strides in terms of economic and human capital development. Her ability to maneuvre India and China has been nothing short of amazing.\n\nBit of a backround. Hasina traitionally was the pro Indian leader and the opposition Khaleda, the pro China, pro Mid east one. It is a testament to Hasina's diplomacy and negotiation ability that both India and China are wholeheartedly pro Hasina now over the opposition. The Mid East are also all on her side.\n\nAs a poor country with no meaningful natural resources and a massive population, we are always bullied by bigger powers. The fact that we are covered in 3 sides by India, which surprise surprise treats her weaker neighbours like crap like all bigger powers, just adds to our misery. An oh wait the one other country that we border is freakin Myanmar. Talk about being geo politcally shortchanged. If you are not born in a third world country, wake up everyday and offer thanks to whatever deity you believe in, that you were born where you were. I cannot explain in words the the levels of impotent rage and resignation that we have about being weak and poor and bullied.\n\nSo for a Bangladeshi leader being able to  use China and India to counterbalance each other out, while maintaining good relations with the West (our entire export market) is just mandatory, and the task as you can imagine is very difficult.\n\nWestern Annoyance at Hasina, when its the EU style is great. they admonish her but work with my country to improve our economy. They throw us some scraps in terms of technology transfer. But most importantly they keep their markets accessible to our exports, and that is what we need.\n\nUS annoyance has a different bite. They are way too free with sanctions and trade restrictions and have no understanding of how truly terrible that is for us. The idea that sanctions hurt the ruling elite is laughable. If the pie shrinks, the elite will just take a bigger slice of whats left. Its the working class and the middle class who will suffer. It is my country and my people who will bear the burden, becasue America decided not to look away, when they could.\n\nIf America were truly long term thinkers, they would try to flip us over to their side completely. You might like India now as they are a counterbalance to China, but you are making the same mistake that you made with China. India is too big and will grow too powerful, for you to keep them as a vassal. India will never be a meek US follower like the EU. Who do you have to counterbalance them? Pakistan? yes to an extent. They are your best hedge being a nuclear power and their military ruling class being firmly in your CIA's pocket. But with China's ever growing influence and their own internal issues and their very divergent beliefs and ideals, is it a good idea for them to be your only hedge against India? Why put all your eggs in one basket? Nepal is a landlocked and too small, Sri Lanka could have been if their trajectory had not taken such a dive. Bangladesh would be a good second hedge for you. Invest more in us and tie our military over to yours, by giving us deals simmilar to what you give to other countries. 30 years down the line a richer more developed and heavily pro Western Bangladesh could be one of your best bets against India. Will we ever be as strong as India, ofcourse not, we are not big enough. But a strong, rich Bangladesh that is not vassalized to India would be a better container for the West, then their current non existent plans. \n\nDespite being Mulsim, our people are more liberal than Pakistan and the mid east. We are much more moderate and the average population is pretty pro Western, despite the US actions in Iraq. We have greater gender parity than most other developing countries and our ideals are not even that far off. Why allow China to increase their influence unchallenged?",
                                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I dont care if they dont love her. But I do care when their annoyance at her leads to the detriment of our economy and security apparatus.</p>\n\n<p>For all the critcisms of Hasina, its been under her that we made the greatest strides in terms of economic and human capital development. Her ability to maneuvre India and China has been nothing short of amazing.</p>\n\n<p>Bit of a backround. Hasina traitionally was the pro Indian leader and the opposition Khaleda, the pro China, pro Mid east one. It is a testament to Hasina&#39;s diplomacy and negotiation ability that both India and China are wholeheartedly pro Hasina now over the opposition. The Mid East are also all on her side.</p>\n\n<p>As a poor country with no meaningful natural resources and a massive population, we are always bullied by bigger powers. The fact that we are covered in 3 sides by India, which surprise surprise treats her weaker neighbours like crap like all bigger powers, just adds to our misery. An oh wait the one other country that we border is freakin Myanmar. Talk about being geo politcally shortchanged. If you are not born in a third world country, wake up everyday and offer thanks to whatever deity you believe in, that you were born where you were. I cannot explain in words the the levels of impotent rage and resignation that we have about being weak and poor and bullied.</p>\n\n<p>So for a Bangladeshi leader being able to  use China and India to counterbalance each other out, while maintaining good relations with the West (our entire export market) is just mandatory, and the task as you can imagine is very difficult.</p>\n\n<p>Western Annoyance at Hasina, when its the EU style is great. they admonish her but work with my country to improve our economy. They throw us some scraps in terms of technology transfer. But most importantly they keep their markets accessible to our exports, and that is what we need.</p>\n\n<p>US annoyance has a different bite. They are way too free with sanctions and trade restrictions and have no understanding of how truly terrible that is for us. The idea that sanctions hurt the ruling elite is laughable. If the pie shrinks, the elite will just take a bigger slice of whats left. Its the working class and the middle class who will suffer. It is my country and my people who will bear the burden, becasue America decided not to look away, when they could.</p>\n\n<p>If America were truly long term thinkers, they would try to flip us over to their side completely. You might like India now as they are a counterbalance to China, but you are making the same mistake that you made with China. India is too big and will grow too powerful, for you to keep them as a vassal. India will never be a meek US follower like the EU. Who do you have to counterbalance them? Pakistan? yes to an extent. They are your best hedge being a nuclear power and their military ruling class being firmly in your CIA&#39;s pocket. But with China&#39;s ever growing influence and their own internal issues and their very divergent beliefs and ideals, is it a good idea for them to be your only hedge against India? Why put all your eggs in one basket? Nepal is a landlocked and too small, Sri Lanka could have been if their trajectory had not taken such a dive. Bangladesh would be a good second hedge for you. Invest more in us and tie our military over to yours, by giving us deals simmilar to what you give to other countries. 30 years down the line a richer more developed and heavily pro Western Bangladesh could be one of your best bets against India. Will we ever be as strong as India, ofcourse not, we are not big enough. But a strong, rich Bangladesh that is not vassalized to India would be a better container for the West, then their current non existent plans. </p>\n\n<p>Despite being Mulsim, our people are more liberal than Pakistan and the mid east. We are much more moderate and the average population is pretty pro Western, despite the US actions in Iraq. We have greater gender parity than most other developing countries and our ideals are not even that far off. Why allow China to increase their influence unchallenged?</p>\n</div>",

Year-to-date, Brent crude has averaged $83.50. Granted, Riyadh can live with less: It can run a fiscal deficit, taking on debt or selling assets to fill the gap; it can also cut spending or raise taxes. The kingdom has already done all three.\n\n\n>...\n\n\n>The biggest issue for the kingdom is that the oil market doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s about to turn around.

Hypersonic Glide Vehicles launch on a rocket, similar to ballistic missiles, but instead of following a high arc parabolic trajectory, and having a majority of flight time being unpowered/assisted by gravity to get to target, they re-enter the atmosphere at hypersonic speeds and get to target via glide.

The United States, by actively supporting a brutal regime that was killing Cubans, and by letting the American companies squeeze Cuba without any restraint.. created the material conditions for radical extremists to come into power. What if they invested in improving the situation in Cuba instead of extracting as much wealth as possible? What if they refused to enable and prop up a violent dictatorship? Less violence, less poverty. Cuban history, and by extension American history, would have been different. Cuba almost caused WW3 in the 60s.\n\nA similar thing happened in Iran - before the Islamic Revolution, Iran was a secular country. The USA, however, did not like the government in power so they overthrew that government. They provoked wars in the Middle East. When Iran and Iraq went to war, the US was secretly providing military aid to both sides. They wanted them to destroy each other.\n\nAnd destroy they did - violence, oppression, poverty. Islamic revolution. We see the same thing in Iraq, destroy Iraq and radical extremists took over whereas before it was a stable secular dictatorship.\n\nI'm not trying to say all the problems in the world are because of country A or B.
