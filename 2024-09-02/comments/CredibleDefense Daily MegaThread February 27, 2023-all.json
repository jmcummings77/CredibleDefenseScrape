The author contrasts the revolutions of 1989 that occurred in all the other satellite states and points out that each one of them came about due to a combination of internal reformers and Gorbachev\u2019s liberalizations. \n\nBut that didn\u2019t happen in East Germany. \n\nIn fact if Eric Honecker had his way I\u2019m sure he would\u2019ve sent in the tanks \u00e0 la Tiananmen Square, it was only Gorbachev\u2019s unwillingness to support it that he backed down. \n\nThe author explains this lack of dissent through the shared border with West Germany. Until the wall went up, any reformer, dissident, religious figure, or capitalist sympathizer had the option and ability to go to West Berlin and emigrate. \n\nThe open border functioned as a release valve for any internal pressure that *was* percolating. None of the other Warsaw Pact nations had that. So by the time the wall went up in the 60s, everybody who decided to stay, inside the party that is, was either a diehard believer or too spineless and cowed to actually take a stand on principles. \n\nI\u2019m thinking something like this could very well happen in Russia right now. I\u2019m sure there were plenty, myself included, that watched the mass exodus of citizens in the early days of the war with a certain sense of schadenfreude.

If a single M777 was firing at me from 6 miles away, how could it hit me if I moved just a few dozen feet in any direction? If the howitzer was firing at me from an elevated position and a soldier was observing me through binoculars, how would the exercise of trying to hit me not be pointless if I moved erratically all the time? What if I'm behind a few hills and a patch of forest and can't even be seen by the soldiers firing at me? Given the fact that it might take a minute for the shell to arrive, and I can reposition faster than the howitzer can change its angle. Vehicles can reposition even faster than infantry. So is artillery of any use to hit small targets, like a company or a small group of vehicles? Or is it more useful when used alongside other batteries to cover a wider area, and against larger enemy formations? Or is it more useful as an area denial or fire suppression weapon?",

If the howitzer was firing at me from an elevated position and a soldier was observing me through binoculars, how would the exercise of trying to hit me not be pointless if I moved erratically all the time? What if I&#39;m behind a few hills and a patch of forest and can&#39;t even be seen by the soldiers firing at me? Given the fact that it might take a minute for the shell to arrive, and I can reposition faster than the howitzer can change its angle. Vehicles can reposition even faster than infantry. So is artillery of any use to hit small targets, like a company or a small group of vehicles? Or is it more useful when used alongside other batteries to cover a wider area, and against larger enemy formations? Or is it more useful as an area denial or fire suppression weapon?</p>\n</div>",

It\u2019s big enough to tear sprockets off the tank, bend barrels, smash optics, etc. It can also create overpressure inside the tank which can hurt the crew, burst ear drums and the line, or even kill in some cases. So there is some value in trying to hit a tank with artillery. The big difference tho is that unlike thin skinned vehicles and we meat sacks you need to basically hit a tank bang on to do damage. Whereas the bursting radius on a 155mm (iirc) will throw metal shards out ~100yds, and so is very likely to hurt soft targets in that radius. \n\nThis is why, for the most part, you either see PGM artillery rounds used on tanks (they hit almost every time) or dedicated AT weapons, while artillery focuses on other easier targets. There have been some dramatic videos, especially from the early war days of the convoys, of artillery just going up and down a line of tanks knocking them out.

And the rest of NATO hasn't really fought in enough conflicts in the recent years to necessitate relieving senior commanders for cause. \n\nThe US military used to regularly relieve their own senior commanders during WW2 and Korea for performance related issues and not getting the job done. It generally stopped happening during the Vietnam War and now typically the only times it happens is from outside pressure from POTUS, Congress, or the media. When reliefs are done, and they happen a lot, they're typically for political related screwups, misspeaking in public, or ethics/morality related issues, occasionally leadership flaws usually related to \"toxic leadership\" issues. But not for poor performance relating to tactical, operational, or strategic success.\n\nIn a healthy military, just like any healthy organization, senior commanders should be rotated often and especially when they don't measure up or their performance slackens for whatever reason. Especially in the military, command is a privilege. Plus there is never a shortage of others wanting the job, there is incredible competition for the senior position, accepting a lackluster general who is mediocre is like saying a large corporation must accept a similarly shitty CEO. The idea that relieving commanders for major screw ups to include negligence creates a climate of fear and risk aversion is bullshit, nobody should feel safe from repercussions for poor performance of the sort that wouldn't be tolerated in a private or lieutenant.\n\nRead Tom Ricks' *The Generals* for more info on that. Overall, the current system in the US military is similar to the \"Thin Blue Line\" and the \"Blue Line of Silence\" institutional culture that stops American law enforcement officers from policing themselves, only doing it when the optics become great enough they have to offer the occasional sacrifice to keep society at bay.",

It generally stopped happening during the Vietnam War and now typically the only times it happens is from outside pressure from POTUS, Congress, or the media. When reliefs are done, and they happen a lot, they&#39;re typically for political related screwups, misspeaking in public, or ethics/morality related issues, occasionally leadership flaws usually related to &quot;toxic leadership&quot; issues. But not for poor performance relating to tactical, operational, or strategic success.</p>\n\n<p>In a healthy military, just like any healthy organization, senior commanders should be rotated often and especially when they don&#39;t measure up or their performance slackens for whatever reason. Especially in the military, command is a privilege. Plus there is never a shortage of others wanting the job, there is incredible competition for the senior position, accepting a lackluster general who is mediocre is like saying a large corporation must accept a similarly shitty CEO. The idea that relieving commanders for major screw ups to include negligence creates a climate of fear and risk aversion is bullshit, nobody should feel safe from repercussions for poor performance of the sort that wouldn&#39;t be tolerated in a private or lieutenant.</p>\n\n<p>Read Tom Ricks&#39; <em>The Generals</em> for more info on that. Overall, the current system in the US military is similar to the &quot;Thin Blue Line&quot; and the &quot;Blue Line of Silence&quot; institutional culture that stops American law enforcement officers from policing themselves, only doing it when the optics become great enough they have to offer the occasional sacrifice to keep society at bay.</p>\n</div>",

The Civil Aviation Authority of Moldova have put out a statement confirming this but which makes clear they are extremely disappointed by the decision and that they have been in constant contact with Wizz trying to convince them not to take this step, which suggests to me that it was taken unilaterally by Wizz in response to the frequent airspace violations rather than due to new intelligence suggesting an imminent threat.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Civil Aviation Authority confirms that the air operator Wizz Air has suspended all its flights to/from Chisinau International Airport starting from March 14, 2023.</p>\n\n<p>The authority was notified by email about the decision, citing safety and security reasons for the airspace in the region.</p>\n\n<p>The Authority and the Ministry of Infrastructure and Regional Development were in permanent collaboration and discussions with Wizz Air representatives, continuously informing about the procedures applied in order to ensure an appropriate level of aeronautical safety and security.

Instead, the Army is procuring GMLRS ER. Why then GLSDBs for Ukraine? Because the current war is highly unusual for the US defense sector.

        "body": "**Identification on the front** \u2013 post from the same person who previously volunteered as an instructor in Ukraine [link](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/wlpnea/credibledefense_daily_megathread_august_11_2022/ijymem0/)\n\n##Part I\n\nThis is a post to solve the problem!\n\nI wanted to write it because:\n\n- once on one of manoeuvres within the framework of pro-defense organizations, when with the commander of a component (professional soldier, veteran of Afghanistan), in which I had the role of platoon commander, I was settling the details of the command and asked about countersigns, and I heard from him: \"why do you need it, they will know their own by their uniforms.\"\n\n- in Ukraine there is a lot of fratricidal fire by the lack of signals, the dynamics of the battle, the fading of perception in fatigue, the lack of any idea of countersigns at all and the ignorance that such a thing is needed at all\n\n- missions have accustomed us to the fact that our people are easy to recognize through the lack of many pieces of equipment, full harmony of subdivisions and general familiarity of people so that Staszek knows that Kazik walks like a duck, and Mariusz slaps every other step.\n\nThe essence of identifying who is one's own and who is the enemy in war has always occurred. Without some system/method of figuring out in battle who is who:\n\na) we shoot our soldiers = unnecessary losses.\n\nb) we have doubts and the enemy has more time to shoot at us\n\nc) we abandon the fight because we will not shoot at our colleagues\n\nd) the enemy easily learns our signals and thus infiltrates our positions, attacks the rear and us from behind\n\nThere are different types of identification:\n\na) visual in the visible band\n\nb) visual by optoelectronics\n\nc) auditory\n\nd) tactile\n\ne) radio\n\nf) has anyone ever encountered identification by smell?\n\nLet's take it one step at a time:\n\n##VISUAL IDENTIFICATION IN THE VISIBLE BAND\n\n**(a)** camouflage of the uniform - that is, we wear a uniform in a certain patter. If the guy across from us has the same \"spots\" then we do not shoot\n\nProblem 1: Our soldier is captured/killed, they pull off his uniform, dress their own diversionary groups in our uniforms, come close with \"calm, it's us\" gestures and attack.\n\nProblem 2: The opponent simply manufactures for himself a fabric with the appropriate camouflage pattern and dresses his own special forces and diversions to make confusion in our rear, etc. To buy such a uniform in China is not a problem, even larger batches. Even companies from Poland used to dress our enemy (photo attached)\n\nProblem 3: If you have a different color uniform than multicam or Ukrainian pixel they will shoot at you at the front on the UA. I've heard this phrase on the front several times, and this way of identification is so deeply ingrained that it can be harmful when not combined with another method.\n\nProblem 4: The mud of the trenches effectively muddies any camouflage to the point of meaninglessness.\n\nConclusion: This type of identification in the reality of the battlefield does not work or even works detrimentally. Uniform colors do not matter because it is too easy to disrupt such identification. This is the first and basic stage of rapid identification, but in my opinion it should be \"demolished\" so to speak because the enemy too easily acquires the uniforms of our forces and takes advantage of this. The colors can get completely dirty and then this type of identification stops working.\n\n**(b)** the right colors of tape - that is, we cover ourselves with the right color of tape and in the right places\n\nProblem 1: The tapes run out.\n\nProblem 2: Bright colors for identification completely ruin camouflage.\n\nProblem 3: Changing the color of tapes throughout the subdivision requires carrying a palette of 3-5 tape colors so as to cover everything and everyone.\n\nConclusion: Colors work quickly and efficiently, if they are changed every fixed period of time, all the better. The problem sometimes is their excess and lack of clarity about where to tape, e.g. we tape our hand, but it didn't say which one, and it was the left one. They work even at long distances.\n\n**(c)** appropriate shapes - i.e., we paint symbols on vehicles/uniforms or apply appropriate symbols to Velcro across the uniform\n\nProblem 1: Slightly ruin camouflage, irregular shapes of spots stop working a bit.\n\nProblem 2: When painting, it's hard to change them regularly, you need paint and remover.\n\nProblem 3: Using Velcro marks when changing them makes noise.\n\nConclusion: Painting on vehicles has been seen since the beginning of the invasion in Ukraine on both sides of the conflict. As for the infantry, it is not a bad idea to have patches with the appropriate symbol \"superimposed\" on the front of the back and on the helmet and changed every 24 hours. Such patches are not disposable, each soldier is supposed to have a set of such patches, e.g. 3-5 different shapes, each shape 3 times. Together this would give 9-15 patches. The patches must be the right size to work, e.g. 10x10 or 15x15 cm, and there must be simple symbols, e.g. triangle, cross, circle, rectangle, penis. The patches must be changed as often as possible, and since they are Velcro it may be easier than tape. Velcro makes noise. At most, they work up to about 25m\n\n**(d)** hand signal further - when you do not want to shout across the field, but need to show that you are \"yours\"\n\nProblem 1: You need to see the silhouette of the \"recipient\" which makes you have to expose yourself to the shot when it's not \"yours\" though.\n\nProblem 2: If you are walking towards the line where you suspect there are soldiers hidden you have to \"transmit\" this signal all the time so that no one shoots at you, because what if you transmit the signal once for 5 seconds, and Stasiek after another 30 seconds has just woken up from his only 5-minute sleep for 3 days and saw a silhouette walking towards the line, and no one has told him that someone of his own is walking? BTW, Stasiek has been fending off successive attacks day and night for the past 3 days, of opponents sneaking up on defensive positions.\n\nProblem 3: Most often you have to use your hand to do it, so you are not able to effectively respond immediately with fire, someone has to cover you.\n\nConclusion: In itself an almost useless signal when you are operating among people you know, because since you have made eye contact it means you have time to identify yourself more accurately, and on the whole you can recognize other identification signals, face shapes, a colleague's limp step, etc. Personally, I often combined this identification signal with the radio, for example, over the radio broadcasting confirmation that I see the left hand raised in the air, the answer yes is my signal, I'm coming to you. An example of a countersign is when asking for a left hand raised above the head, the answer is to raise the left leg up. With impaired perception, simple and useful when you don't know well the people who are in your subdivision, such as when replacements arrive and you need to quickly catch up with new people. They are hard to overhear, sometimes the enemy can spot them, three such passwords changed randomly every day have a good effect. It also works with night vision and thermal imaging.\n\n**(e)** hand signal closer - when at close range to 25m or so you want to show some small sign, for example, with your hand\n\nProblem 1: This signal is so small that you have to make eye contact with the other soldier. So you have to expose yourself to the shot.\n\nProblem 2: What if you have a masked glove against your uniform? You have to take that glove off for a while, which takes time, etc.\n\nProblem 3: The more detailed the hand signals, the closer the distance must be.\n\nApplication: It must be a simple signal, and at the same time distinguishable from hand command signals, such as making a twix with the hand and fingers against the face, showing the movement of making a BJ, quickly running the hand over the thigh, etc. It works is simple and as there are rifles pointed at each other, sometimes such a signal can save better than any vocal countersign. It's hard to overhear them, you have to see them, three such passwords changed randomly every day have a good effect. It also works in night vision and with thermal imaging.\n\n**(f)** flashing light - we set the flash(s) with the appropriate color of light (usually not white but red or blue), this is usually done by covering the flashlight with the whole hand clenched in a gloved fist, turn the flashlight on the lowest light mode, loosen the clenched fist so that the light shines for a moment as if through a tunnel only in the direction of the potential recipient. If we want to \"flash\" twice, we clench our fist and relax it again. Then we clench and turn off the flashlight. In response, there should be a fixed number of flashes of the corresponding color.\n\nProblem 1: Everyone must have similar flashlights with the same colors of light. New additions may not have such flashlights.\n\nProblem 2: You glow at night which in itself gives away where you are. The front is as black as anywhere you've been, so any light is immediately highly visible from a distance.\n\nProblem 3: What if you shine in the direction of the enemy because you have confused the directions?\n\nConclusion: The way is good, but for rich subdivisions. It seems to be just a flashlight with two or three different colored lights, but in a war where losses are high and supplies are limited it may not work. Nevertheless, if there is at least one such multi-colored light for each maneuvering element, it can already work. If you flash the light during the day, then the problem of everyone automatically finding the light like at night goes away. This flashing of light also works during the day.",

The patches must be changed as often as possible, and since they are Velcro it may be easier than tape. Velcro makes noise. At most, they work up to about 25m</p>\n\n<p><strong>(d)</strong> hand signal further - when you do not want to shout across the field, but need to show that you are &quot;yours&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Problem 1: You need to see the silhouette of the &quot;recipient&quot; which makes you have to expose yourself to the shot when it&#39;s not &quot;yours&quot; though.</p>\n\n<p>Problem 2: If you are walking towards the line where you suspect there are soldiers hidden you have to &quot;transmit&quot; this signal all the time so that no one shoots at you, because what if you transmit the signal once for 5 seconds, and Stasiek after another 30 seconds has just woken up from his only 5-minute sleep for 3 days and saw a silhouette walking towards the line, and no one has told him that someone of his own is walking? BTW, Stasiek has been fending off successive attacks day and night for the past 3 days, of opponents sneaking up on defensive positions.</p>\n\n<p>Problem 3: Most often you have to use your hand to do it, so you are not able to effectively respond immediately with fire, someone has to cover you.</p>\n\n<p>Conclusion: In itself an almost useless signal when you are operating among people you know, because since you have made eye contact it means you have time to identify yourself more accurately, and on the whole you can recognize other identification signals, face shapes, a colleague&#39;s limp step, etc. Personally, I often combined this identification signal with the radio, for example, over the radio broadcasting confirmation that I see the left hand raised in the air, the answer yes is my signal, I&#39;m coming to you. An example of a countersign is when asking for a left hand raised above the head, the answer is to raise the left leg up. With impaired perception, simple and useful when you don&#39;t know well the people who are in your subdivision, such as when replacements arrive and you need to quickly catch up with new people. They are hard to overhear, sometimes the enemy can spot them, three such passwords changed randomly every day have a good effect. It also works with night vision and thermal imaging.</p>\n\n<p><strong>(e)</strong> hand signal closer - when at close range to 25m or so you want to show some small sign, for example, with your hand</p>\n\n<p>Problem 1: This signal is so small that you have to make eye contact with the other soldier. So you have to expose yourself to the shot.</p>\n\n<p>Problem 2: What if you have a masked glove against your uniform? You have to take that glove off for a while, which takes time, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Problem 3: The more detailed the hand signals, the closer the distance must be.</p>\n\n<p>Application: It must be a simple signal, and at the same time distinguishable from hand command signals, such as making a twix with the hand and fingers against the face, showing the movement of making a BJ, quickly running the hand over the thigh, etc. It works is simple and as there are rifles pointed at each other, sometimes such a signal can save better than any vocal countersign. It&#39;s hard to overhear them, you have to see them, three such passwords changed randomly every day have a good effect. It also works in night vision and with thermal imaging.</p>\n\n<p><strong>(f)</strong> flashing light - we set the flash(s) with the appropriate color of light (usually not white but red or blue), this is usually done by covering the flashlight with the whole hand clenched in a gloved fist, turn the flashlight on the lowest light mode, loosen the clenched fist so that the light shines for a moment as if through a tunnel only in the direction of the potential recipient. If we want to &quot;flash&quot; twice, we clench our fist and relax it again. Then we clench and turn off the flashlight. In response, there should be a fixed number of flashes of the corresponding color.</p>\n\n<p>Problem 1: Everyone must have similar flashlights with the same colors of light. New additions may not have such flashlights.</p>\n\n<p>Problem 2: You glow at night which in itself gives away where you are. The front is as black as anywhere you&#39;ve been, so any light is immediately highly visible from a distance.</p>\n\n<p>Problem 3: What if you shine in the direction of the enemy because you have confused the directions?</p>\n\n<p>Conclusion: The way is good, but for rich subdivisions. It seems to be just a flashlight with two or three different colored lights, but in a war where losses are high and supplies are limited it may not work. Nevertheless, if there is at least one such multi-colored light for each maneuvering element, it can already work. If you flash the light during the day, then the problem of everyone automatically finding the light like at night goes away. This flashing of light also works during the day.</p>\n</div>",

Not encountered elsewhere. Perhaps someone has seen another use.\n\n**(h)** signal pennant/panel signal - that is, when they are shooting at us, we are lying on the ground, and we want to raise higher just a piece of cloth for identification (preferably orange or pink). In Ukraine, it was common to simply use the state flag because it is highly visible.\n\nProblem 1: The cloth can also be seen by the opponent\n\nProblem 2: You have to carry pieces of cloth about 30x30cm in size. You need to prepare for yourself these pieces of cloth in bright colors beforehand.\n\nConclusion: A good clearly visible signal. For stopping the fratricidal fire that is already shooting at us it is hard to get something better.\n\n##VISUAL IDENTIFICATION BY OPTOELECTRONICS\n\n**(a)** IR light seen in night vision - either in the form of a steady light or a strobe that flashes at the appropriate frequency\n\nProblem 1: If the opponent has night vision, you are like a beacon.\n\nProblem 2: Any drone with an IR camera can see you from many kilometers above.\n\nProblem 3: You have to have night vision and those fabulous flashing lights, and it's not cheap equipment.\n\nConclusion: Not suitable for full-scale warfare in the field. Unless you can direct/screen the light, for example, only upwards, if you have an advantage in the air or our air force flies in that area. Otherwise we bring the shelling on ourselves. In the city it's already a bit better, where the scattering of IR marker light is limited by buildings. For quick identification during a sudden attack on the enemy quite good. They don't have to have it all, as people act in a certain concentration one per team is enough. More for marking the entire grouping for support subunits.\n\n**(b)** IR reflectors - Velcro-applied panels that, when illuminated by at least a residual light, give a faint glow seen only in night vision\n\nProblem 1: Velcro makes noise when changed during operations.\n\nProblem 2: They have to be slightly illuminated meaning the checker has to gently glow which betrays him in any night vision.\n\nProblem 3: You have to have night vision, and it's expensive equipment, while the Velcro itself doesn't cost that much anymore.\n\nConclusion: A good patent, you should have large symbols on these reflectors that can be seen from a long distance so that it can be quickly identified. This works better on a clear night when there are stars and the moon, because it already gently illuminates these reflectors. It can also betray, but at close range, so it's not too bad.\n\n**(c)** a visible signal in thermal imaging - some fixed sign that will change some of the body heat or leave a momentary warm trace, e.g. lifting the helmet and putting it on, making a circle mark on the jacket with a warm hand, unzipping the jacket for a while, etc.\n\nProblem 1: The signal giver must know that the observation is being carried out continuously by the thermo.\n\nProblem 2: Cold bodies give less heat especially on the extremities.\n\nProblem 3: The opponent also sees better radiated heat.\n\nProblem 4: You have to have thermal imaging, and that good thermal imaging costs money.\n\nConclusion: I applied this once, as we used to have more than one thermal imager. For the reason that thermal imaging also sees ordinary hand signals, we mostly used ordinary hand signals further and closer.\n\n**(d)** a corresponding flash or shape painted with an IR laser - we decide for example that when the laser draws a circle on the ground, or flashes three times, it means that it's one of our own.\n\nProblem 1: Very limited number of symbols to draw quickly, max is circle, line, cross, because, for example, a rectangle will look the same as a circle wanting to draw it quickly\n\nProblem 2: If the opponent has night vision he will see our shapes/flashes\n\nProblem 3: There must be night vision and lasers, and this is expensive equipment.\n\nConclusion: A good patent when the fight is at short distances, when laser visibility is limited by walls of houses, forest, etc. where you can shine for a moment on the ground or wall. If you apply this patent by shining into the sky, as it were, you can ask in the ether whether our subdivisions are there.\n\n##AUDITORY IDENTIFICATION\n\n**(a)** passwords and responses - and here we have several variations\n\n- a word and a word - preferably with the same letter to make it easier to remember and two non-associative words like AVALANCHE \u2013 CURLS\n\n- complement to some digit - preferably no more than 12 because with larger numbers there are problems if perception works a little worse. If the complement is up to 9, someone asks 3 you answer 6 and voila!\n\n- spacing of letters in the alphabet - if the spacing is set to 3, I say A You answer D and voila! Do not give more than up to the letter F in the password and not more spacing than 3 because it will be mixed.\n\n- color palette from cold to warm - you simply say the next or previous color e.g. the palette is purple, blue, green, yellow, orange, red in turn.\n\n- animal sound - I first encountered this in Ukraine, but it works cool because the idea is not to make a human voice, which can be treacherous. E.g., the password is a single swish or one hoot of an owl, the answer is two swishes or hoots of an owl, etc. Useful at night when we can't see the recipient, and often want to send a query into the ether \"where are you\"\n\nProblem 1: You can be heard! Sometimes from several hundred meters away.\n\nProblem 2: The password can be overheard.\n\nProblem 3: You have to change the system every so often.\n\nConclusion: The simplest, used most often, without changing the system, the opponent knows what to expect. Everyone knows it, everyone uses it, so it is easy for the opponent even if he is a retard to break/understand such passwords.\n\n**(b)** the sound of a whistle - simple, it carries far, you can immediately hear who is who, e.g. the password is one short whistle, the answer one longer whistle\n\nProblem 1: You can be heard! Certainly from several hundred meters.\n\nProblem 2: Easy to overhear.\n\nProblem 3: If you use the whistle for other commands it can get confused.\n\nConclusion: Good for farther distances, as you don't want to lean out of the burrow to get it right away, just to ask into the ether if your own are there. You have to change regularly because it's easy to overhear. As you whistle from hiding, it's not so simple to find the place of the \"whistler\".",

In the long run, you need to use recognition codes/keywords/radio tables.\n\n**(b)** Talking about nothing - that is, we talk to each other, for example, about adult movies and what kind of brunettes or blondes weren't there, or what kind of poop wasn't there after dinner yesterday, and both the topic of conversation and the words used provide information about what happened or what action we are taking\n\nProblem 1: One sometimes has to learn by heart a whole table of key words to describe our situation.\n\nProblem 2: You have to disguise it in the kind of ordinary frontal radio conversation, as if two meaningless shvei were talking about mundane matters.\n\nConclusion: If you do it right, you can talk like this even over an unprotected radio. At the same time, we hide our actions in keywords, and secondly, we shallow the attention of the eavesdropper because there are some two simple shvei talking.\n\n**(c)** battle management systems - that is, software that gives us the ability to securely exchange information about where our subunits are and where the enemy is, you can tag a detected enemy, send alerts, correct artillery, call in MedEvac etc.\n\nProblem 1: No one has so far come up with software that works effectively on the network and updates the location of allied units in real time, while doing so in an encrypted manner.\n\nProblem 2: Any system of this type requires communications. Connectivity can be jammed and the system becomes offline.\n\nProblem 3: Very power-hungry, practically requiring a vehicle and fuel for constant power.\n\nConclusion: The Americans have their Blue Force Tracker, which has already worked on several fronts, while BFT means every vehicle/whole subdivision, there is no way for every soldier to have BFT. An A-TAK application has been created, and in my opinion it is unintuitive, but it supposedly works. We have our Topaz, but I have no idea how it works. The Ukrainians made their Kropiwa, which works offline and online when there is connectivity via Starlink or Motorola on the vehicles. The Ukrainians also made a simpler application called Milchat, which was used during the defense of Mariupol and worked quite well. These battlefield management applications and programs are the future and need to be introduced and learned to use.\n\n##THE GENERAL PROBLEM OF CHANGING PASSWORDS REGULARLY!\n\nIf we set up regular password changes then we either carry the new password with us in the form of a small piece of paper to be eaten or symbols drawn on our skin/forearm to remind us of our passwords or we don't plan anything, we just make up a new password(s) and transmit it over the radio encrypted with a minimum 256 bit key. We also change the keys on the radios once a week or a minimum of once every two weeks. If we don't want to chatter new passwords over the radio then we simply have to visit every man in the subdivision or distribute new passwords/passwords by word of mouth.\nSometimes I myself wonder whether to change passwords regularly or irregularly, and I come to the conclusion that it is better to change them regularly, because there is so much of it anyway that just remembering a new password, and sometimes a new password system every dozen hours in case of limited perception is a problem.\n\n##EXAMPLES FROM UKRAINE:\n\n- there was to be a swap of subdivisions in the trenches, the enemy used people from the DNR who knew Ukrainian, they knew the recognition passwords, which had not been changed for several days, in addition, the incomplete platoon was dressed in Ukrainian uniforms. They came to the line the day before, responded with a signal, shared pipes, chatted and shot everyone from the subunit that was to be changed.\n\n- Due to nightly attacks by the Russians, the lack of thermo and night vision, the long time of being on the line and PTSD, one of the soldiers at night in position shot at everything that approached, even those who approached the line of trenches and said the password. No one cooperated with him at night. The result was that as they retreated from the line, they retreated without him. During the day, they returned to the line, and the boy sat there alone, hunched over and firing at anything that approached. They waited until he had fired all his ammunition, took him to the rear, sent him to the hospital.\n\n- They handed out weapons in Kiev for anyone who came, territorial swivel units were formed and replenished from random people. When previously dormant diversionary groups in Ukrainian uniforms began to operate in the city and the news was carried, imagination began to work. No one had established, changed or coordinated reconnaissance passwords, so there were often situations where one platoon embedded in a block would shoot at a platoon in another block until someone waved and shouted \"We're our own! Don't shoot!\" And this was a countersign that was later used in the chaos by the Russians as well, \"We our own! Don't shoot!\"\n\n- The APC had no communication with the infantry platoon it was supposed to support with fire. The platoon went into the assault wrapped on its shoulders with colored tape. The assault was successful, the trenches cleared, when the first Ukrainian soldier poked his head out without tape, the gunner gave cannon fire because he thought it was another Russian escaping from the trench. The head snapped off.\n\n- Medics went to get the wounded. Returning, they entered the observation sector of the subdivision, unaware of their departure. They gave them fire with an AGS-17, good thing it was off target.\n\n- On one of the maneuvers where I acted as a platoon commander during a simulation of an assault in a city (in Wodzislaw Slaski to be exact), through my poor assessment of the situation and desire to kick the enemy, we went a little too far during the final phase of the assault and entered the sector of responsibility of another platoon. The soldiers reported that someone was lurking there behind the corner in the next alley, I gave the signal to open fire, the firing went, the result was two wounded from the allied platoon, one wounded from us. Senseless, the lack of signals for quick identification and my overconfidence that I was doing the right thing led to the situation that the aggression of the assault took precedence over the plan.\n\nForce identification signals must be used. Professionals do it in different ways, so that in a given situation that particular way works best. There is no one-size-fits-all way. You need to know how to apply and know all of them, and you also need to invent your own identification systems. You have to change identification signals regularly and use different systems. Don't change regularly? The opponent will start using yours. Don't use different systems? It's the opponent who will work out your system after a while and start using your signals. You use a system of color signals at night? Something you probably didn't anticipate \ud83d\ude42 . You do not plan to use recognition signals at all? Death in that case, will be lurking on every corner.\n\nTranslated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version), fixed some parts that didn't translate well, let me know if something is incomprehensible.\n\n---\n\nThe author also mentioned he decided to make the write-up after watching the video of the two surrendering Ukrainian soldiers who were still holding their weapons after being dazed by a grenade, it turned out the Russian soldier was able to approach their position in the first place because he knew the countersigns and was wearing a Ukrainian uniform.",

At the same time, we hide our actions in keywords, and secondly, we shallow the attention of the eavesdropper because there are some two simple shvei talking.</p>\n\n<p><strong>(c)</strong> battle management systems - that is, software that gives us the ability to securely exchange information about where our subunits are and where the enemy is, you can tag a detected enemy, send alerts, correct artillery, call in MedEvac etc.</p>\n\n<p>Problem 1: No one has so far come up with software that works effectively on the network and updates the location of allied units in real time, while doing so in an encrypted manner.</p>\n\n<p>Problem 2: Any system of this type requires communications. Connectivity can be jammed and the system becomes offline.</p>\n\n<p>Problem 3: Very power-hungry, practically requiring a vehicle and fuel for constant power.</p>\n\n<p>Conclusion: The Americans have their Blue Force Tracker, which has already worked on several fronts, while BFT means every vehicle/whole subdivision, there is no way for every soldier to have BFT. An A-TAK application has been created, and in my opinion it is unintuitive, but it supposedly works. We have our Topaz, but I have no idea how it works. The Ukrainians made their Kropiwa, which works offline and online when there is connectivity via Starlink or Motorola on the vehicles. The Ukrainians also made a simpler application called Milchat, which was used during the defense of Mariupol and worked quite well. These battlefield management applications and programs are the future and need to be introduced and learned to use.</p>\n\n<h2>THE GENERAL PROBLEM OF CHANGING PASSWORDS REGULARLY!</h2>\n\n<p>If we set up regular password changes then we either carry the new password with us in the form of a small piece of paper to be eaten or symbols drawn on our skin/forearm to remind us of our passwords or we don&#39;t plan anything, we just make up a new password(s) and transmit it over the radio encrypted with a minimum 256 bit key. We also change the keys on the radios once a week or a minimum of once every two weeks. If we don&#39;t want to chatter new passwords over the radio then we simply have to visit every man in the subdivision or distribute new passwords/passwords by word of mouth.\nSometimes I myself wonder whether to change passwords regularly or irregularly, and I come to the conclusion that it is better to change them regularly, because there is so much of it anyway that just remembering a new password, and sometimes a new password system every dozen hours in case of limited perception is a problem.</p>\n\n<h2>EXAMPLES FROM UKRAINE:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>there was to be a swap of subdivisions in the trenches, the enemy used people from the DNR who knew Ukrainian, they knew the recognition passwords, which had not been changed for several days, in addition, the incomplete platoon was dressed in Ukrainian uniforms. They came to the line the day before, responded with a signal, shared pipes, chatted and shot everyone from the subunit that was to be changed.</p></li>\n<li><p>Due to nightly attacks by the Russians, the lack of thermo and night vision, the long time of being on the line and PTSD, one of the soldiers at night in position shot at everything that approached, even those who approached the line of trenches and said the password. No one cooperated with him at night. The result was that as they retreated from the line, they retreated without him. During the day, they returned to the line, and the boy sat there alone, hunched over and firing at anything that approached. They waited until he had fired all his ammunition, took him to the rear, sent him to the hospital.</p></li>\n<li><p>They handed out weapons in Kiev for anyone who came, territorial swivel units were formed and replenished from random people. When previously dormant diversionary groups in Ukrainian uniforms began to operate in the city and the news was carried, imagination began to work. No one had established, changed or coordinated reconnaissance passwords, so there were often situations where one platoon embedded in a block would shoot at a platoon in another block until someone waved and shouted &quot;We&#39;re our own! Don&#39;t shoot!&quot; And this was a countersign that was later used in the chaos by the Russians as well, &quot;We our own! Don&#39;t shoot!&quot;</p></li>\n<li><p>The APC had no communication with the infantry platoon it was supposed to support with fire. The platoon went into the assault wrapped on its shoulders with colored tape. The assault was successful, the trenches cleared, when the first Ukrainian soldier poked his head out without tape, the gunner gave cannon fire because he thought it was another Russian escaping from the trench. The head snapped off.</p></li>\n<li><p>Medics went to get the wounded. Returning, they entered the observation sector of the subdivision, unaware of their departure. They gave them fire with an AGS-17, good thing it was off target.</p></li>\n<li><p>On one of the maneuvers where I acted as a platoon commander during a simulation of an assault in a city (in Wodzislaw Slaski to be exact), through my poor assessment of the situation and desire to kick the enemy, we went a little too far during the final phase of the assault and entered the sector of responsibility of another platoon. The soldiers reported that someone was lurking there behind the corner in the next alley, I gave the signal to open fire, the firing went, the result was two wounded from the allied platoon, one wounded from us. Senseless, the lack of signals for quick identification and my overconfidence that I was doing the right thing led to the situation that the aggression of the assault took precedence over the plan.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Force identification signals must be used. Professionals do it in different ways, so that in a given situation that particular way works best. There is no one-size-fits-all way. You need to know how to apply and know all of them, and you also need to invent your own identification systems. You have to change identification signals regularly and use different systems. Don&#39;t change regularly? The opponent will start using yours. Don&#39;t use different systems? It&#39;s the opponent who will work out your system after a while and start using your signals. You use a system of color signals at night? Something you probably didn&#39;t anticipate \ud83d\ude42 . You do not plan to use recognition signals at all? Death in that case, will be lurking on every corner.</p>\n\n<p>Translated with <a href=\"http://www.DeepL.com/Translator\">www.DeepL.com/Translator</a> (free version), fixed some parts that didn&#39;t translate well, let me know if something is incomprehensible.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>The author also mentioned he decided to make the write-up after watching the video of the two surrendering Ukrainian soldiers who were still holding their weapons after being dazed by a grenade, it turned out the Russian soldier was able to approach their position in the first place because he knew the countersigns and was wearing a Ukrainian uniform.</p>\n</div>",

How can they tell if Russian crude is Russian crude?\n\nEven in this scenario I think an embargo is unlikely but the answer is fairly obvious: they'd just stop the oil at whatever border they can. There's only so much oil that can flow through a pipe, after all.\n\nIt might not be 100% successful and hell it might even cost more money to the west than it does Russia but as long as it harms the profitability of Russian oil enough then that may be enough to justify the cost.\n\nWithout an embargo Russian oil is already selling at a massive discount to foreign buyers and that can only get worse the more stringent the conditions Europe places on them.\n\nIt's a balance between political will in the west and how much countries are willing endure to penalise Russia - if Russia puts their hand onto the scales then there's only one way it can end for them.",

Scientific questions are answered by data and falsification, and to my knowledge DOE has not provided any, nor is it clear why they would (CDC/NIH would be preferable sources). \n\nThe null hypothesis for the emergence of COVID-19, and all pathogens to date, is [animal spillover](https://www.amazon.com/Spillover-Animal-Infections-Human-Pandemic/dp/0393066800/ref=nodl_?dplnkId=54c82552-3205-4ef7-a094-4f8363e9a052). Every \u201clab leak confirmation\u201d not only fails to include data, but doesn\u2019t even attempt to address why the spillover null hypothesis should be rejected. Strictly speaking, the scientific method requires rejection of the null hypothesis before adopting a new one.

        "body": "After about a year, I've seen no credible expert or indication that the Ukraine/Russo war has an offramp. Right now, they are stuck in a fight for existence. \n\nCurrently, the story is that Russia is losing. In other words, they are losing international standing, they are losing people/material/equipment faster than Ukraine, and their war fighting capability is heavily hampered. Additionally, the Russian economy is not doing great. \n\nBut here is the problem with that narrative, even if Russia is losing, what does that look like?  \n\nThe answer is a continued escalation up the escalation ladder. Right now, Russia is at mobilization (along with bombing civilian infrastructure) and the NATO is at providing armored heavy weapons to Ukraine. Here are other steps in the escalation ladder menu. Not in any particular order for Russia. \n\nRussia's Escalation Ladder Menu\n\n* More mobilization\n* Use of Nuclear Weapons\n* A nuclear exchange - First strike\n* Use of chemical warfare\n* Use of biological warfare\n* Getting lethal support from other countries (China, North Korea)\n* Getting personnel support from other countries (China, North Korea)\n* Attacking lethal support in NATO countries\n* Destroying global infrastructure \n* Invading Supporting countries - like Poland\n* Cutting more diplomatic ties with Ukraine (no more prisoner swaps)\n\nIt's a pretty gnarly list. It also doesn't look like Russia has a lot of good escalation options. \n\nLooking over the Nato/Ukraine's escalation ladder menu, it's a little different. Again, not in any particular order.\n\n* More mobilization\n* More attacking targets within Russia\n* Use of chemical warfare\n* Use of biological warfare\n* NATO coalition provide more advanced weapon systems to include 4th gen aircraft, stealth weapons, ATACMS, SEAD capability, more sophisticated drones, nuclear weapons, etc.\n* Covert NATO coalition personnel involvement\n* Overt NATO coalition personnel involvement \n* Destruction of Russian infrastructure\n* Attacks on Russian civilian targets\n* Use of Nuclear weapons\n* Nuclear exchange - first strike\n* Increasing economic isolation of Russia\n* Invasion of Russia by NATO\n\nSo NATO/Ukraine have a much large escalation menu, with a lot more options.\n\nUsing this analysis, what would you consider Russia to do next if Mobilization fails? What are their options? To me, the first is to get material support from their allies. Mainly China and North Korea. Which it sounds like Russia is trying that right now, and has been trying it for a long time. Along with decreasing diplomatic ties (I'm surprised the prisoner swaps lasted this long). \n\nIf support from other countries fails, it looks like the use of nuclear weapons is next. That seems to be the least problematic escalation that they have. They might try chemical warfare, but the problem with chemical warfare is it is just not very effective. Additionally, biological warfare is much more complex and difficult, and I don't believe Russia has deep biological warfare capability. Obviously, attacking NATO or international infrastructure pretty much will guarantee an international response with NATO troops in Ukraine. \n\nFor NATO/Ukraine, the escalation path looks like more advanced weapons. So I'd expect 4th gen fighters (eventually with a nerfed version of the AIM-260), ATACMS, and more sophisticated drones. Additionally, Covert NATO coalition personnel involvement (if we're not already there) is probably pretty likely. \n\nWhat's the end game? When does this end? To me, the current state is continued escalation. As options start to dwindle, either Russia finds an offramp, or we're talking about a full-scale world involvement (Chinese troops in Ukraine), nuclear exchange or a Russian invasion. NOT FUN.",

This is a limited war for Russian, hence why Putin has been so reluctant to take the measures needed to win. Hence why its still not even considered a war...\n\nUkraine was in a fight for its existence early in the war, when the threat of govt collapse and Russian takeover of a significant portion of their country was legitimate. But that threat ended in late March. Now they're stuck in a fight trying to liberate what was taken from them since the start of this war as well as Crimea and the Donbas that's been contested since 2014. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>For NATO/Ukraine, the escalation path looks like more advanced weapons. So I'd expect 4th gen fighters (eventually with a nerfed version of the AIM-260), ATACMS, and more sophisticated drones. Additionally, Covert NATO coalition personnel involvement (if we're not already there) is probably pretty likely\n\nNone of those things is likely. \n\nGiving Ukraine 4th Gen aircraft is more [complex than most people realize](https://warontherocks.com/2023/02/amateur-hour-part-iii-its-still-not-about-the-airplane/).\n\nATACMS are not only a  major escalatory threat (the only real \"red line\" stated by the Russian govt, as ATACMS are legitimate ballistic missiles). Plus there are a very limited number of them, they are no longer manufactured, and their replacement, the Precision Strike Missile, hasn't even been developed yet so there is zero replacement. \n\nCovert NATO forces in Ukraine is an act of war against Russia, let that sink in.

This is a limited war for Russian, hence why Putin has been so reluctant to take the measures needed to win. Hence why its still not even considered a war...</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine was in a fight for its existence early in the war, when the threat of govt collapse and Russian takeover of a significant portion of their country was legitimate. But that threat ended in late March. Now they&#39;re stuck in a fight trying to liberate what was taken from them since the start of this war as well as Crimea and the Donbas that&#39;s been contested since 2014. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>For NATO/Ukraine, the escalation path looks like more advanced weapons. So I&#39;d expect 4th gen fighters (eventually with a nerfed version of the AIM-260), ATACMS, and more sophisticated drones. Additionally, Covert NATO coalition personnel involvement (if we&#39;re not already there) is probably pretty likely</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>None of those things is likely. </p>\n\n<p>Giving Ukraine 4th Gen aircraft is more <a href=\"https://warontherocks.com/2023/02/amateur-hour-part-iii-its-still-not-about-the-airplane/\">complex than most people realize</a>.</p>\n\n<p>ATACMS are not only a  major escalatory threat (the only real &quot;red line&quot; stated by the Russian govt, as ATACMS are legitimate ballistic missiles). Plus there are a very limited number of them, they are no longer manufactured, and their replacement, the Precision Strike Missile, hasn&#39;t even been developed yet so there is zero replacement. </p>\n\n<p>Covert NATO forces in Ukraine is an act of war against Russia, let that sink in. Plus, there is no need for it, the Ukrainians are doing good enough without needing advisors in country, if they need support they can literally do a Zoom call mid battle.

I basically said \"Mobilization is pretty much inevitable.\" And people in this sub said \"Russia wouldn't be that stupid to send waves of Russians at Ukrainian lines.\" Well here we are. \n\nWhenever someone says Russia can't be that stupid and use some international or geopolitical argument, I pretty much throw that in the trash because if Russia cared about Geopolitics, they wouldn't have invaded Ukraine or gone with full mobilization or annexed parts of Ukraine. Yet they did. \n\nSo yeah, China/India have pretty much no say in what Putin does.",

Using nukes is a losing strategy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So was invading Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>I also am blown away with the conversation i had at the beginning of the war. I basically said &quot;Mobilization is pretty much inevitable.&quot; And people in this sub said &quot;Russia wouldn&#39;t be that stupid to send waves of Russians at Ukrainian lines.&quot; Well here we are. </p>\n\n<p>Whenever someone says Russia can&#39;t be that stupid and use some international or geopolitical argument, I pretty much throw that in the trash because if Russia cared about Geopolitics, they wouldn&#39;t have invaded Ukraine or gone with full mobilization or annexed parts of Ukraine. Yet they did. </p>\n\n<p>So yeah, China/India have pretty much no say in what Putin does.</p>\n</div>",
