        "body": "On the last thread there seemed to be some confusion as to how HARMs were used, owing to a Koffman podcast where he mentioned lobbing. I\u2019m no HARM expert certainly, but I thought I could contribute something to that discussion. Since the thread flipped over I figured I put it here instead. \n\nIn terms of targeting, the AGM-88 (at least with US software) has three targeting modes. The first used a GPS tracker. The missile travels to the designated waypoint, activates is radar sensor, and attacks the preprogrammed platform. This is the most planned attack profile, but can also be configured in air on an aircrafts MFDs. Second, the HARM can be set to a passive search mode, in which the pilot selects and programs an attack (based solely off of detected emissions) while in air. Key to this mode is that the target radar must be emitting continuously from target selection to impact, whereas in the GPS mode the target need only emit during the final attack phase. Lastly, a HARM can be set to a defensive hip shot mode. The HARM searched for targets and if an aggressive radar lock is established on the platform, the HARM will automatically select this source as a target. In the defensive mode the time from danger to employment is dramatically reduced, so a pilot can fire and leave. \n\nIn the first two firing modes, the HARM can be launched with one of two attack profiles: flat trajectory or parabolic trajectory. Some people in the previous thread latched onto this parabolic attack profile thinking maybe that HARMS were being tossed like a lobbed bomb or something. This isn\u2019t the case. Moreover the parabolic trajectory is not really for increasing range. It might, in some limited sense, but it\u2019s not really a 45^ launch angle. And anyway, by reasons of air density launch *altitude* matters way more for range than the missiles trajectory. The parabolic mode is thus more about accuracy during the final attack. HARMs track radar emanations, but it\u2019s not always an exact science. Yet HARMs need to basically be bang on, and without outside assistance, to make their kill. The parabolic trajectory changes the attack so that rather than glide in to the target, low on energy, the HARM falls *down* onto the target and maintains greater energy and thus accuracy. To execute this maneuver, again at least on US systems, you can simply set the missile into a pull back mode. When the weapon release is pressed the plane directs the pilot into a steep, full afterburner, climb. When the plane has reached the targeted angle, altitude, and speed, the weapon releases and engages its own motor to complete its climb to altitude. I wouldn\u2019t call that a lob necessarily but it is similar to how one lobs a bomb. \n\nWhen combined with the GPS navigation mode, it can make the missile *very* effective. Preplanned strikes against transmitting radars are possible, as are wild weasel strikes in which an accurate missile can be put into the air *before* a known site begins  transmitting.",

Most of the emission profiles are collected by Signals intelligence planes during times of peace or in a war with opponents that are using export models, this is probably why we see much signals intelligence being flown in the Black Sea right now as their collecting threat data on Russian AD and counter battery radars. Older systems almost have entirely defined threat profiles so I imagine that the threat profile of the S300 series is very well understood due to its age and export. The S400 is less definitive because it\u2019s a much newer system and there\u2019s less intelligence on it.

Attacking a specific known AD site HARMs are launched to suppress radars allowing other planes to enter the threat envelope and drop bombs on the specific equipment actually destroying it (this is what the USAF did doctrinally, on the opposite end the Navy used the HARMs purely as suppression to allow strike packages to enter threat envelopes and destroy other targets it was never the USN\u2019s goal to destroy the AD system itself.)",

I generally tend to think that it is, their fleet doesn't really offer them that much in the modern era and I think that this conflict has reinforced it. Losing the Moskva as they did was disastrous for national image and just the Navy in general and I don't think their assets in the Black Sea have had much of an impact even as mobile missile platforms. That said, their fleet probably helps deny a potential assault on Crimea to a certain extent.  The Kuznetsov, the aircraft carrier that should be the centerpiece of their naval power, is basically a floating joke at this point.

                    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>The &quot;Is the Russia Navy a boondoggle?&quot; argument has been going on for a while now among Russia watchers. I generally tend to think that it is, their fleet doesn&#39;t really offer them that much in the modern era and I think that this conflict has reinforced it. Losing the Moskva as they did was disastrous for national image and just the Navy in general and I don&#39;t think their assets in the Black Sea have had much of an impact even as mobile missile platforms. That said, their fleet probably helps deny a potential assault on Crimea to a certain extent.  The Kuznetsov, the aircraft carrier that should be the centerpiece of their naval power, is basically a floating joke at this point.

The other most common Russian trucks (Ural 4x4) are 4.2t road carrying weight. I\u2019d assume an average of actual carrying capacity more like 5-6t per truck.\n\nIn addition, I think the estimate of 500/900t per day seems too low in itself. We\u2019re talking about 15-20% of the entire Russian \u201con the ground\u201d troop strength here. Enough rounds for 1 tube for 1 day heavy firing is 5t. A single MLRS firing for 3 launchers is also about 1 truck worth.\n\nI think you\u2019re talking 500t to just feed the artillery alone, at our new average truck weight about 80 trucks, to which fuel, all other ammo and all other supplies have to be added.\n\nI think 50-90 trucks per day is way underestimating what you\u2019d need to keep 15-20k troops supplied in combat.\n\nI means you\u2019re talking about 15-20% of all Russian troops in country. If 50-90 trucks per day can keep them all supplied *in combat*. You\u2019d only need 200-400 truck loads per day to keep the whole Russian army in Ukraine supplied given most aren\u2019t in combat most of the time. That seems ridiculously low.\n\nEDIT: thinking about it. Weren't they boasting about firing 25k artillery rounds a day in the battle for sveriodonetsk ? Assuming they\u2019d want to use half that many rounds per day in Kherson\u2026. That Ks 12,500x0.05t = 625t of artillery *shells* alone (propellant is extra). 100+ Truck loads in just the artillery shells.",

A single MLRS firing for 3 launchers is also about 1 truck worth.</p>\n\n<p>I think you\u2019re talking 500t to just feed the artillery alone, at our new average truck weight about 80 trucks, to which fuel, all other ammo and all other supplies have to be added.</p>\n\n<p>I think 50-90 trucks per day is way underestimating what you\u2019d need to keep 15-20k troops supplied in combat.</p>\n\n<p>I means you\u2019re talking about 15-20% of all Russian troops in country. If 50-90 trucks per day can keep them all supplied <em>in combat</em>. You\u2019d only need 200-400 truck loads per day to keep the whole Russian army in Ukraine supplied given most aren\u2019t in combat most of the time. That seems ridiculously low.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: thinking about it. Weren&#39;t they boasting about firing 25k artillery rounds a day in the battle for sveriodonetsk ? Assuming they\u2019d want to use half that many rounds per day in Kherson\u2026. That Ks 12,500x0.05t = 625t of artillery <em>shells</em> alone (propellant is extra). 100+ Truck loads in just the artillery shells.</p>\n</div>",

An IFV brings its own infantry support, often has a rapid-firing medium caliber autocannon (such as the rarden or bushmaster guns), and still offers adequate protection against most small arms. It's a huge force multiplier in cases where the enemy has little to no anti-armor weaponry, especially when your side has air supremacy to count on for when a 30mm cannon isn't enough.\n\nIFV's in Ukraine have to contend with way more anti armor weaponry, artillery and airstrikes, compared to operations like Iraq and Afghanistan have seen. They are definitely more vulnerable, and doctrine seems to still be relatively fluid on the ukrainian side at least. The russians have not been as exposed with their BMP's and BMD's lately as they were in the opening weeks, either.\n\nThey still bring a lot of firepower with them though, even when there's weaponry around that can defeat IFV armor. Nothing manportable can lay down the same suppressing fire as a 30mm autocannon firing HE frag shells. Hell, even an APC-mounted .50 is nowhere near that level of \"I am destroying all in that general direction\".\n\nPersonally I think IFV's are far from being extinct. The \"BMP's everywhere for everyone\" doctrine might have turned out to be a bit of a dud on a modern battlefield, but that's nowhere near enough reason to discount the entire category of vehicles. Even when their role in (near-)peer wars seems smaller than at least Soviet and Russian doctrine dictate, they will still be quite cost-effective for most modern armies operating in strongly asymmetrical theatres. If the best your enemy has is chambered in 7.62x39 you don't need a main battle tank.

My problem is essentially:\n\nWe have become so used to sanctions that they've essentially become a reflex action in recent years, being thrown around almost whimsically. They should be carefully considered and thoroughly justified as beneficial if they are to be used. They have real world impacts on real people. Doing 'something' is not always better than doing nothing.\n\nIn particular though, if you actually care about sanctions working then they should be agreed and imposed multilaterally. They should not be *imposed* on the world (this is where extraterritoriality comes in) just because it's easier and saves having to bother with silly old diplomacy. All it does it collapse the international system even more and make the future use of sanctions all the more likely.\n\n> These countries C can choose who to trade with: A or B.\n\nThis is very much a mindset born from a position of privilege and an inability to see other perspectives. You are just advocating for a system in which the economically strong can bully the weak. It is dishonest, and also goes against... well... the entire rules based international order that we profess to support.\n\nWhy do you think that countries that stringently advocate for national sovereignty oppose this argument? Because it *undermines* their sovereignty. You are forcing them to make a choice they don't have to make. just because you want them to make it doesn't mean you have any say in the matter. Essentially country A's sovereignty isn't somehow more important than country C's.\n\nNational sovereignty is only guaranteed by the international system. The same international system that is undermined by this argument. The ability for countries to economically interact unencumbered  with others is core to our way of life.\n\n> I assume that most of this anti-sanctions rhetoric actually stems from America sanctioning minor states such as Cuba.\n\nNope. It's over all sorts. There was even huge issues within the EU in 2020 over the US sanctioning german companies related to nordstream 2. This has been going on for decades and only escalating.\n\n> But if Cuba professes that their state ideology is an inherent enemy of America's ideology, and thus America must be destroyed through a revolution, then it is only logical that America will attempt to stomp that socialistic creature in it's crib.\n\nLiterally the entire planet disagrees.\n\n> If Cuba want's sanctions to be removed, they can abandon their authoritarian, anti-liberal order.\n\nYou have no right to impose by force your own ideology on another country. That applies just as much to Russia as it does the US.\n\n> If I remember correctly, UN regularly holds a vote on ending sanctions on Cuba.\n\nLol it's one of the examples i gave above.\n\n29 years in a row. probably 30 now actually",

This has been going on for decades and only escalating.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>But if Cuba professes that their state ideology is an inherent enemy of America&#39;s ideology, and thus America must be destroyed through a revolution, then it is only logical that America will attempt to stomp that socialistic creature in it&#39;s crib.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Literally the entire planet disagrees.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>If Cuba want&#39;s sanctions to be removed, they can abandon their authoritarian, anti-liberal order.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You have no right to impose by force your own ideology on another country. That applies just as much to Russia as it does the US.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>If I remember correctly, UN regularly holds a vote on ending sanctions on Cuba.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Lol it&#39;s one of the examples i gave above.</p>\n\n<p>29 years in a row. probably 30 now actually</p>\n</div>",
