I've been reading this Russian website \"topwar\" for a while, it offers an interesting insight into the Russian propaganda and how Russians watching the war think (from the numerous article comments). \n\nA couple of things I've noticed:\n\n* basically everyone thinks the war is developing (very) badly for Russia, there seems to be roughly 3 groups in how they want to solve it:\n  * conventional escalation - total mobilization of the country, economy. Many still believe that Russia is holding back and call for bombing of decision centers (= Zelensky etc.), Dnipro bridges etc. A common belief is that Russia isn't striking Dnipro bridges because there are some business deals around them - they need to be preserved to be used once Ukraine is occupied. As reality sets in, they are calling for destroying them.\n  * nuclear escalation - a decent portion wants to explicitly threaten nuclear escalation to force the West to back off, some are promoting outright nuclear bombing - sometimes Ukraine, sometimes Western countries.\n     * Crimea does not seem to be a decisive factor in the nuclear escalation for most commenters. \n  * a small, but visible minority seems to be advocating more or less explicitly to retreat from Ukraine (even Crimea). A common counter to that (from the two groups above) is that this war is existential and that NATO will just continue destroying Russia anyway.\n* they are very critical of Russian leadership, most often criticizing Shoigu, Peskov and leadership in abstract, but often they are quite open in criticizing Putin as well\n   * the obvious lying and propaganda of MoD (e.g. Konaschenko) is criticized / mocked. \n   * a lot of complaints about many crossed red lines and no response. Russia and Russian leadership are not respected internationally anymore.\n* The grain deal is really a pain in the as* for most of them, it's a surprisingly big topic. It's a sort of \"proof\" of a secret collaboration with the West.\n  * Similarly, the fact that Russia still does business with the West is considered traitorous. Many call for total stop of business.\n* Most of the commentators think that a ceasefire as China proposes is a clear Russian loss. Ukraine will get armed to the teeth and start a new war soon. Related to the next point:\n* Many call to destroy Ukraine as a whole to secure peace. There don't seem to be any partial goals like conquering Donbas and calling for peace. The whole Ukraine must be conquered (sometimes with the exception of Galicia).\n* There is a sense of isolation, that Russia has no allies. China is looked at with suspicion.

It's a sort of \"proof\" of a secret collaboration with the West.\n\nI noticed this, too, and it's one of the reasons why I'm willing to entertain the idea that some of the voices in Russian \"official PR\", many pro-Russian content creators, and a good chunk of the Russian public all live in an alternate and completely irrational reality. It's an idea that *normally* I try not to entertain at all, about anything, because it's a lazy way of interpreting facts -- it's super easy to decide that anything which doesn't make sense to you must be completely out of whack.\n\nBut this one's baffling because the answer(s) are obvious -- this isn't a secret collaboration with the West, it's open collaboration with China, first of all, with Belarus, and to a lesser degree with Turkey (which, okay, counts as the West, but I don't think it's critical).\n\nChina, and some of the African countries it dumped its Belt and Road money on, are major importers of Ukrainian grain. China could probably get the 5+ million tons of grain it imported from Ukraine prior to the war from elsewhere but it still needs it to keep flowing in order to protect its investments in Africa. Russia needs things quiet in Africa, too. The grain deal also kept fertilizer exports from Russia and Belarus flowing -- both also necessary in order to keep the global food market prices under some semblance of control so that China's African projects don't implode, but also in order to keep the important chemical industry and agriculture sectors in Belarus and Russia going. It probably kept some of the Turkish shipping industry happy, too, but honestly I think that's the least critical bit -- if it weren't for Chinese and domestic interests, I think it's far less likely that the deal would've been signed.\n\nNone of this is super-secret. China openly pressed for the deal, they didn't make a secret of it. The UN pushed for it, too, and pointed out it's important for its food aid programs, and it *can't* be too hard to look at the list of countries where UN aids and food prices are critical, the list of countries where Chinese and Russian companies are active (including Wagner, but not just Wagner), and see that there's a good overlap. Everyone who pressured Russia into the grain deal did so openly and for very plausible reasons.\n\nI can see *why* loudmouthed content creators & co. don't want to admit that Russia currently lacks the international autonomy required to bail out, but they could at least keep quiet about it, or spin it in terms of \"we're in a tough spot but we're *still* we're helping poor children in Africa\" tearjerker speeches.

And my impressions align with yours. And with the grain deal in particular, I think we are seeing the conspiratorial mindset in action. The obvious is never the truth. There must be some deeper, secret reality to which only the super clever have access. By affirming the believer's superior faculties, the conspiratorial mindset is thus a form of ego protection and a reaction to perceived threats to the believer's security or status.\n\nI am beginning to recognize this phenomenon as a common symptom of having consumed too much propaganda of the classically Soviet variety, which seeks not to persuade people of a specific truth but rather to discredit the possibility of even knowing any truth at all. I see it a lot with hardcore Trump supporters lately. They frequently use the phrase, \"Yeah, but do you believe that?\" when presented with some fact that does not fit their narrative. I live in a rural area so I hear that phrase with alarming regularity. People around here habitually, instinctually dismiss any source of information that conflicts with their pre-existing beliefs. When pressed to justify that dismissal, they resort to complex conspiracies to justify their position. \n\nFor example, last week I pointed out to someone that a quarter of the US federal debt is attributable to the Trump tax cuts. The conversation devolved into an argument about whether the Congressional Budget Office is conspiring with deep state Democrats to promote an anti-Trump narrative because CBO employees get paid by the federal government and therefore are willing to lie to increase federal spending because it benefits them. Which gave me the worst sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu from a similar argument with a similar person years ago about how climate scientists lie about climate change so they can get more money (unlike the completely impartial oil companies, of course). \n\nMy larger point being that people are capable of adopting a belief system where ideology or in-group loyalty are more important than facts. At some point, it's almost not worth deconstructing their fantasies, because you're basically just watching someone deeply delusional work through their cognitive dissonance in real time. The best you can do is suggest the least harmful interpretation of events that fits comfortably within the boundaries of their imaginary world. Such as your suggestion that they 'spin it in terms of \"we're in a tough spot but we're still we're helping poor children in Africa\"'. Because then Russia big, Russia strong. It maintains their delusions.\n\nThat's what makes Russian propaganda so scary, though. \"Russia big, Russia strong\" doesn't match reality anymore, not by a long shot. There doesn't seem to be any way to allow them to continue with their delusions without just letting them beat up Ukraine unhindered, and even then I don't think they'd be able to achieve their objectives because they overreached so massively. There just isn't any conceivable consolation prize that both supports their delusional viewpoint and conforms to the realities on the ground. Even complete recognition of their control over Crimea doesn't fit the bill. I worry that in the absence of any such diplomatic solution that is compatible with their delusional worldview, the Russians will reach for nuclear weapons simply because that is the only option left to make them feel big and powerful.\n\nThe only other possible outcome is that the Ukrainians will dissuade them of their mistaken beliefs on the battlefield. But as you point out, that doesn't seem to be happening, as large contingent of Russians continue to believe they haven't really been exerting their full strength in the war yet, and that a large amount of untapped Russian military potential remains to be brought to bear. Despite ample evidence of the opposite. I also worry that a Russian battlefield defeat will end up like Weimar Germany, with delusional ideologues misrepresenting a true military defeat that was accepted as such by the elites as an internal betrayal by some particularly disfavored minority.",

The buildup has touched all branches of the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA), as well as the People\u2019s Armed Police (PAP) and the Chinese Coast Guard. The PLA created the Army Aviation Corps in 1988. This force now has many hundreds of attack helicopters, including at least 250 Z-10s...\n\n>This article will review a special issue of the Chinese-language defense magazine \u201cShipborne Weapons\u201d (\u8230\u8f7d\u6b66\u5668, published by the Zhengzhou Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering) that examines the future prospects for Chinese helicopters in light of the Ukraine War and, in doing so, asks some hard questions of Chinese military planners.\n\n>The analysis in \u201cShipborne Weapons\u201d is candid about the vital role for helicopter operations: \u201cEspecially when the Taiwan security situation is deteriorating day by day, Army Aviation will be responsible for important cross-sea landing support missions.\u201d It is also suggested, moreover, that the design of PLA attack helicopters had \u201cto consider the issues of cross-sea operations and anti-helicopter operations, and therefore, have higher requirements for range and maneuverability.\u201d As discussed below, such requirements have led to designs that favor range over armor, allowing these platforms to stay engaged in the island combat zone for at least 30 minutes, according to this analysis...\n\n>The Chinese assessment concludes that Russia appears to have lost over 30 Mi-24/28/35 and Ka-52 helicopters in the first two months of the Ukraine War. These figures \u201cinclude shoot downs [and] damaged forced landings. If considering the overall number of helicopter dispatches, sorties and combat time of the Russian army, this loss rate has exceeded the generally acceptable range.\u201d\n\n>The article suggests that \u201cmost of the losses of Russian helicopters have been caused by problems in the Russian military\u2019s thinking and actual combat practices.\u201d Yet, it is also recognized that \u201ceven with the suppression of intermediate and long-range air defenses, when using helicopters\u2026 to perform low-altitude and ultra-low-altitude assault operations, they still face grave threats from man-portable air-defense systems.\u201d Moreover, it notes that the problem is especially acute for helicopters flying at slower speeds.\n\n>One of the main Chinese observations of Russian attack helicopter performance in the war in Ukraine pertains directly to the limitations of Russian missiles. In another major Chinese defense journal, the point was made, \u201cThe anti-tank missiles currently in use are all models developed in the 1970s and 1980s. They\u2026 have two major shortcomings: short range and lack of \u2018fire and forget\u2019 capability. This leads to helicopters having to enter anti-aircraft kill zones\u2026 and greatly reduces survivability on the battlefield.\u201d The Chinese, on the other hand, note that the most recent Z-10 attack helicopters have \u201ca new-generation of upgraded long-range, multi-purpose air-to-ground strike munition. This new weapon not only has an increased range of more than 20 kilometers, but also uses an advanced millimeter wave/infrared multi-mode guidance system with fire-and-forget capability and strong anti-jamming technology.\u201d\n\nA good article about China's helicopter force and how Chinese military journals have used information from the war in Ukraine to assess the it's usefulness in a war against Taiwan.

        "body": ">[Posing as Islamists, Russian Hackers Take Aim at Sweden](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-05-14/posing-as-islamists-russian-hackers-take-aim-at-sweden?re_source=boa_mustread)\n\n\n>>A series of coordinated cyberattacks intended to jeopardize the Nordic country\u2019s chances of joining NATO have been disrupting its biggest companies](\n\n>Since February, a mysterious hacker group calling itself Anonymous Sudan has targeted dozens of Swedish airports, hospitals and banks with distributed denial-of-service attacks, ostensibly in response to the burning of a Koran in front of the Turkish embassy in Stockholm earlier this year.\n\n>The so-called DDoS attacks, which push websites and services offline by overwhelming them with internet traffic, disrupted online programming at Sweden\u2019s national public broadcaster and knocked out the websites of Scandinavian Airlines, state-owned power company Vattenfall, and defense firm Saab AB. Extensive media coverage has made the attacks \u2014 and Anonymous Sudan\u2019s claims \u2014 a matter of public debate in Sweden.\n\n>The group behind this campaign claims to consist of hacktivists from the East African nation whose aim is to go after \u201canyone who opposes Islam.\u201d But a closer inspection of Anonymous Sudan\u2019s social media records \u2014 and data from the attacks \u2014 show that the group is neither Sudanese nor Islamist, according to Mattias W\u00e5hl\u00e9n, who led an investigation into the hacks for Truesec, one of Sweden\u2019s biggest cybersecurity firms.\n\n>Instead, he said, Anonymous Sudan shows signs of being a well-organized unit of Russians with a nuanced knowledge of Swedish politics and social issues. Their apparent motivation is to craft attacks designed to amplify tensions with the country\u2019s Muslim minority and pressure Turkey to stand firm in rejecting Sweden\u2019s bid to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. If they were to succeed, it could make Sweden more vulnerable to future attacks. \n\n>Publicly available information on the group\u2019s Telegram channel contained clues about its true origins, W\u00e5hl\u00e9n said. On its biography page, Anonymous Sudan listed its main language as Russian and its location as Russia, according to the Truesec report he authored. The group also aligned itself online with Killnet, a pro-Russia political hacking group that\u2019s targeted organizations and countries opposed to the war in Ukraine. Furthermore, an official account belonging to the hacking collective Anonymous has denied any connection to the group, the report showed.\n\n>Another clue is that Anonymous Sudan appears to be well-funded. Instead of using networks of infected computers to launch attacks cheaply \u2014 the usual way hacktivist attacks are carried out \u2014 the group rented 61 servers in Germany from IBM Corp.\u2019s SoftLayer division to conduct its operations, hiding them behind layers of anonymity, according to another Swedish cybersecurity firm, Baffin Bay Networks. Two weeks after the Anonymous Sudan attacks began, Baffin Bay said it worked with IBM to have the servers taken down. \n\n>\u201cIBM works with industry partners and law enforcement agencies to identify and address malicious use of the IBM Cloud platform, as happened in this instance,\u201d IBM said in a statement. \u201cWe appreciate Baffin Bay Networks\u2019 partnership in this matter.\u201d\n\n>Scandinavian Airlines did not return messages about its outages. SVT and Vattenfall confirmed their incidents. Saab declined to comment.\n\n>While W\u00e5hl\u00e9n and his team were unable to determine whether Anonymous Sudan consisted of Russian government employees or pro-Russia hackers working independently, Katarzyna Zysk, a professor of international relations at the Norwegian Institute for Defence Studies in Oslo, said the timing and organization of the attacks, the hackers\u2019 knowledge of religious and political friction points in Sweden, and the attacks\u2019 similarities to other Russian influence operations led her to conclude that the group was controlled or guided by Russia\u2019s intelligence services.\n\n>>\u201cThis strategy of creating chaos is one of the major means Russia has been using against Sweden\u201d to complicate its NATO application, she said. \u201cAll these campaigns move in the same direction.\u201d\n\n>Anonymous Sudan, for its part, has dismissed claims that it works on behalf of Russia. \u201cWe have nothing to do with Russia,\u201d the group wrote on Telegram, after Truesec published a report in February outing the group. \u201cWe help them because they helped us before, and this is a way to give back.\u201d \n\n>The Anonymous Sudan attacks demonstrate that suspected Russian hackers are finding new ways to meddle in the political processes of the country\u2019s democratic opponents, according to W\u00e5hl\u00e9n and other security experts. As President Vladimir Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine grinds into its second year, Russia\u2019s hackers are growing increasingly active in advancing the country\u2019s geopolitical interests, experts said.\n\n>Within just a few months, Anonymous Sudan has become one of the most prolific hacktivist groups on the internet and a vehicle for promoting a variety of Russian causes. While the group has launched attacks on countries including Denmark, France, Germany, India and Israel, experts believe its primary aim is to erode support for NATO expansion, which would strengthen northern Europe\u2019s defense against Russian aggression. \n\n>After Russia invaded Ukraine last year, Sweden and close ally Finland abandoned their longstanding policy of abstaining from military alliances and decided to apply to join the organization together. All 30 existing members needed to agree, and from the beginning Turkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan said he wouldn\u2019t support the move.\n\n>Erdo\u011fan\u2019s government has long been irked by the activities of a large and politically active Kurdish minority in Sweden, which includes individuals aligned with groups that Turkey considers terrorist.\n\n>Last June, Sweden, Finland and Turkey reached an agreement on measures to ensure a way forward. While Swedish leaders say they have since met all of Turkey\u2019s requests, negotiations came to a halt in January after a far-right provocateur burned the Koran, which happened less than two weeks after Kurdish activists hung an effigy of Erdo\u011fan from a lamppost near Stockholm\u2019s City Hall.\n\n>The Koran burning occurred in a political context \u201cthat was already very sensitive,\u201d said Diana Selck-Paulsson, a researcher with Orange Cyberdefense, a division of French telecom Orange S.A., in Malm\u00f6, Sweden. \u201cAnd the cyber reaction of Anonymous Sudan, when looking at the timing and the pro-Russian character, feels quite calculated.\u201d\n\n>To W\u00e5hl\u00e9n, who worked 35 years as an analyst in Sweden\u2019s intelligence services before joining Truesec in 2020, the Russian hacking offensive \u201cexpertly exploited\u201d political vulnerabilities \u2014 namely, Sweden\u2019s need to be in \u201cthe good graces of Turkey\u201d and the country\u2019s struggles with assimilating thousands of Muslim refugees \u2014 \u201cto make Sweden\u2019s NATO campaign more difficult.\u201d\n\n>According to national broadcaster SVT, Russian agents also took to the streets of European capitals in the wake of the Koran burning as part of an operation aimed at sowing discord between European nations and Turkey. Documents leaked to exiled Russian opposition activist Mikhail Khodorkovsky\u2019s Dossier Center showed that Russia staged fake protests in cities such as Paris, where people claiming to be Ukrainians displayed anti-Turkish banners, burned a Turkish flag and posed for pictures with their arms raised in Nazi salutes.\n\n>While it\u2019s impossible to know exactly how successful these Russian efforts have been, in April, Erdo\u011fan instructed Turkey\u2019s parliament to ratify Finland\u2019s entry into NATO \u2014 leaving Sweden behind. Its prospects for joining the alliance remain uncertain.\n\n>Truesec was founded in 2005 by Marcus Murray, a former special operations ranger in the Swedish Navy, to protect Swedish organizations at a time when the biggest threats to computer networks were fast-spreading worms and viruses. But as hacking attacks evolved, Truesec grew in tandem, and the company now has 300 employees. Since Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, an act Stockholm denounced, experts say that the pace of cyberattacks, disinformation and military provocations emanating from Russia has increased dramatically. Russian operatives have used a variety of methods to try to manipulate public opinion in Sweden about Ukraine and a potential NATO bid, including publishing forgeries of Swedish government documents.  \n\n>In the first week of May, as Sweden\u2019s prime minister and other Nordic leaders met with Ukraine\u2019s president in Finland to pledge continued support for Ukraine\u2019s defense, a new round of attacks targeted Sweden\u2019s police and tax agencies, as well as its financial supervisory authority.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-05-14/posing-as-islamists-russian-hackers-take-aim-at-sweden?re_source=boa_mustread\">Posing as Islamists, Russian Hackers Take Aim at Sweden</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>A series of coordinated cyberattacks intended to jeopardize the Nordic country\u2019s chances of joining NATO have been disrupting its biggest companies](</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since February, a mysterious hacker group calling itself Anonymous Sudan has targeted dozens of Swedish airports, hospitals and banks with distributed denial-of-service attacks, ostensibly in response to the burning of a Koran in front of the Turkish embassy in Stockholm earlier this year.</p>\n\n<p>The so-called DDoS attacks, which push websites and services offline by overwhelming them with internet traffic, disrupted online programming at Sweden\u2019s national public broadcaster and knocked out the websites of Scandinavian Airlines, state-owned power company Vattenfall, and defense firm Saab AB. Extensive media coverage has made the attacks \u2014 and Anonymous Sudan\u2019s claims \u2014 a matter of public debate in Sweden.</p>\n\n<p>The group behind this campaign claims to consist of hacktivists from the East African nation whose aim is to go after \u201canyone who opposes Islam.\u201d But a closer inspection of Anonymous Sudan\u2019s social media records \u2014 and data from the attacks \u2014 show that the group is neither Sudanese nor Islamist, according to Mattias W\u00e5hl\u00e9n, who led an investigation into the hacks for Truesec, one of Sweden\u2019s biggest cybersecurity firms.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, he said, Anonymous Sudan shows signs of being a well-organized unit of Russians with a nuanced knowledge of Swedish politics and social issues. Their apparent motivation is to craft attacks designed to amplify tensions with the country\u2019s Muslim minority and pressure Turkey to stand firm in rejecting Sweden\u2019s bid to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. If they were to succeed, it could make Sweden more vulnerable to future attacks. </p>\n\n<p>Publicly available information on the group\u2019s Telegram channel contained clues about its true origins, W\u00e5hl\u00e9n said. On its biography page, Anonymous Sudan listed its main language as Russian and its location as Russia, according to the Truesec report he authored. The group also aligned itself online with Killnet, a pro-Russia political hacking group that\u2019s targeted organizations and countries opposed to the war in Ukraine. Furthermore, an official account belonging to the hacking collective Anonymous has denied any connection to the group, the report showed.</p>\n\n<p>Another clue is that Anonymous Sudan appears to be well-funded. Instead of using networks of infected computers to launch attacks cheaply \u2014 the usual way hacktivist attacks are carried out \u2014 the group rented 61 servers in Germany from IBM Corp.\u2019s SoftLayer division to conduct its operations, hiding them behind layers of anonymity, according to another Swedish cybersecurity firm, Baffin Bay Networks. Two weeks after the Anonymous Sudan attacks began, Baffin Bay said it worked with IBM to have the servers taken down. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cIBM works with industry partners and law enforcement agencies to identify and address malicious use of the IBM Cloud platform, as happened in this instance,\u201d IBM said in a statement. \u201cWe appreciate Baffin Bay Networks\u2019 partnership in this matter.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Scandinavian Airlines did not return messages about its outages. SVT and Vattenfall confirmed their incidents. Saab declined to comment.</p>\n\n<p>While W\u00e5hl\u00e9n and his team were unable to determine whether Anonymous Sudan consisted of Russian government employees or pro-Russia hackers working independently, Katarzyna Zysk, a professor of international relations at the Norwegian Institute for Defence Studies in Oslo, said the timing and organization of the attacks, the hackers\u2019 knowledge of religious and political friction points in Sweden, and the attacks\u2019 similarities to other Russian influence operations led her to conclude that the group was controlled or guided by Russia\u2019s intelligence services.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cThis strategy of creating chaos is one of the major means Russia has been using against Sweden\u201d to complicate its NATO application, she said. \u201cAll these campaigns move in the same direction.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Anonymous Sudan, for its part, has dismissed claims that it works on behalf of Russia. \u201cWe have nothing to do with Russia,\u201d the group wrote on Telegram, after Truesec published a report in February outing the group. \u201cWe help them because they helped us before, and this is a way to give back.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>The Anonymous Sudan attacks demonstrate that suspected Russian hackers are finding new ways to meddle in the political processes of the country\u2019s democratic opponents, according to W\u00e5hl\u00e9n and other security experts. As President Vladimir Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine grinds into its second year, Russia\u2019s hackers are growing increasingly active in advancing the country\u2019s geopolitical interests, experts said.</p>\n\n<p>Within just a few months, Anonymous Sudan has become one of the most prolific hacktivist groups on the internet and a vehicle for promoting a variety of Russian causes. While the group has launched attacks on countries including Denmark, France, Germany, India and Israel, experts believe its primary aim is to erode support for NATO expansion, which would strengthen northern Europe\u2019s defense against Russian aggression. </p>\n\n<p>After Russia invaded Ukraine last year, Sweden and close ally Finland abandoned their longstanding policy of abstaining from military alliances and decided to apply to join the organization together. All 30 existing members needed to agree, and from the beginning Turkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan said he wouldn\u2019t support the move.</p>\n\n<p>Erdo\u011fan\u2019s government has long been irked by the activities of a large and politically active Kurdish minority in Sweden, which includes individuals aligned with groups that Turkey considers terrorist.</p>\n\n<p>Last June, Sweden, Finland and Turkey reached an agreement on measures to ensure a way forward. While Swedish leaders say they have since met all of Turkey\u2019s requests, negotiations came to a halt in January after a far-right provocateur burned the Koran, which happened less than two weeks after Kurdish activists hung an effigy of Erdo\u011fan from a lamppost near Stockholm\u2019s City Hall.</p>\n\n<p>The Koran burning occurred in a political context \u201cthat was already very sensitive,\u201d said Diana Selck-Paulsson, a researcher with Orange Cyberdefense, a division of French telecom Orange S.A., in Malm\u00f6, Sweden. \u201cAnd the cyber reaction of Anonymous Sudan, when looking at the timing and the pro-Russian character, feels quite calculated.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>To W\u00e5hl\u00e9n, who worked 35 years as an analyst in Sweden\u2019s intelligence services before joining Truesec in 2020, the Russian hacking offensive \u201cexpertly exploited\u201d political vulnerabilities \u2014 namely, Sweden\u2019s need to be in \u201cthe good graces of Turkey\u201d and the country\u2019s struggles with assimilating thousands of Muslim refugees \u2014 \u201cto make Sweden\u2019s NATO campaign more difficult.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>According to national broadcaster SVT, Russian agents also took to the streets of European capitals in the wake of the Koran burning as part of an operation aimed at sowing discord between European nations and Turkey. Documents leaked to exiled Russian opposition activist Mikhail Khodorkovsky\u2019s Dossier Center showed that Russia staged fake protests in cities such as Paris, where people claiming to be Ukrainians displayed anti-Turkish banners, burned a Turkish flag and posed for pictures with their arms raised in Nazi salutes.</p>\n\n<p>While it\u2019s impossible to know exactly how successful these Russian efforts have been, in April, Erdo\u011fan instructed Turkey\u2019s parliament to ratify Finland\u2019s entry into NATO \u2014 leaving Sweden behind. Its prospects for joining the alliance remain uncertain.</p>\n\n<p>Truesec was founded in 2005 by Marcus Murray, a former special operations ranger in the Swedish Navy, to protect Swedish organizations at a time when the biggest threats to computer networks were fast-spreading worms and viruses. But as hacking attacks evolved, Truesec grew in tandem, and the company now has 300 employees. Since Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, an act Stockholm denounced, experts say that the pace of cyberattacks, disinformation and military provocations emanating from Russia has increased dramatically. Russian operatives have used a variety of methods to try to manipulate public opinion in Sweden about Ukraine and a potential NATO bid, including publishing forgeries of Swedish government documents.  </p>\n\n<p>In the first week of May, as Sweden\u2019s prime minister and other Nordic leaders met with Ukraine\u2019s president in Finland to pledge continued support for Ukraine\u2019s defense, a new round of attacks targeted Sweden\u2019s police and tax agencies, as well as its financial supervisory authority.  A pro-Russian group claimed responsibility for the attacks on social media.  </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhen we take measures, they regroup and return in new formations,\u201d said the tax agency\u2019s chief information officer, Peder Sj\u00f6lander. \u201cThey are competent as well as persistent.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>While the cyber campaigns against Sweden still pale in comparison to those levelled at Ukraine and the Baltic states, Russian efforts to shape the international narrative about the Nordic country have become more obvious in recent years. Since the 2015 refugee crisis, which saw the country take in a large number of people fleeing war and poverty, Kremlin-controlled media outlets have sought to portray Sweden as a failing state rife with suburban riots, crime and terrorism in the wake of uncontrolled migration.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThere were of course real problems,\u201d said Mikael Tofvesson, operational head of the Swedish Psychological Defence Agency, which was established last year to counter influence operations targeting Sweden. \u201cWe did have a refugee crisis, and the Russians didn\u2019t create the problems, but they amplified them,\u201d he noted. \u201cThe general intent of the different narratives they were using was that you can\u2019t trust the government.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

A half-educated guess about what the recipe would include would go as follows (with the standard grain of salt disclaimer, I've worked on non-military systems that share some of the constraints, but never on missile guidance systems).\n\nMuch of it boils down to math done very, very quickly, as /u/TechnicalReserve1967 mentioned. At the end of the day it's still a tracking system so, hand-waving it a lot, it still boils down to \"what point in space do we need to reach\" and \"what adjustments do we need to make to the control surfaces to fly towards this point in space\". Both questions can be answered in mathematical terms, but the nature of the two problems is very different.\n\n(Note: someone else here mentioned vectored thrust -- that's also a thing; I don't know if there are any HTK weapons that use it. Maybe LEAP? I wrote most of this thinking about Lockheed's MHTK, for absolutely no justifiable reason)\n\nIn abstract terms, the latter is scarier because aerodynamics is weird, but I suspect that a good enough numerical model of the missile's behaviour makes it surprisingly straightforward compared to how hard the physics looks at first. IMHO the former is scarier and is where the really super-secret sauce is more likely to be. On paper, it looks deceivingly simple, you just chase the other rocket, but at those speeds, if you *literally* try to chase it, as in, you adjust the control surfaces to target the exact place the other missile is currently at, you'll miss pretty much every time.\n\nI suspect the math would be split in this case. Some of it is done on the ground, to figure when it's okay to launch: if you draw the target's trajectory on paper, it looks inviting, but you probably can't hit it throughout that path: some regions may be legit unreachable or unusable (e.g. out of range, or too close to you), the target may just be hard to intercept in others, you're a hunk of metal with tiny fins flying at ridiculous speeds so you can't adjust you trajectory infinitely much, and for infinitely long, before you overshoot the target. Thus, there's probably a particular window where you're sure you can reach your target in time, you're still far enough from your location for that to matter, and you have the highest chance to maneuver your missile for a successful intercept.\n\nThe rest is done on-board. I would venture a guess that the exact tracking method, used to figure out *where* the missile ought to fly to, involves more than one model, one for longer range operation and one for when you're close enough to the other hunk of metal.\n\nI imagine the other major constraint is that the missile's control profile needs to be responsive and \"tight\" -- it should respond quickly to control surface adjustments, and it should do so with a high degree of predictibility and stability. Physics would suggest that these two are competing requirements to some degree but I don't know enough about missiles to say how much.\n\nSpeaking from experience, more often than not, the secret sauce rarely turns out to be something truly conceptually revolutionary, in this case, say, like a completely novel way to control flight, or a completely new type of solid fuel. Most of the time it's super boring: it's well-known physics, well-applied, and a mix of engineering solutions that, taken in isolation, you can explain to an undergrad and they'd get it.",

However, Beijing did acknowledge that it was running so-called service stations in Germany, which it promised to close.\n\n>Despite the pledge, China still maintains at least two mobile police stations in Germany whose activities are carefully watched by local authorities, Interior Ministry Spokesman Maximilian Kall said at the conference. \n\n>\u201cThe security authorities are closely monitoring these activities as well as other activities of foreign states in Germany. And this applies in particular and especially to these overseas police stations,\u201d Kall said. \u201cThese are usually not fixed, stationary offices but mobile facilities.\u201d\n\n>Germany is liaising closely with the US and other European Union member states on the matter and on how to address the extraterritorial activities of Chinese security authorities more broadly, Sasse said. Berlin is also in ongoing talks with China about the issue, she added.\n\n>\u201cThe Chinese government has always upheld international law and respected the sovereignty and jurisdiction of all countries,\u201d according to an embassy statement. \u201cThe Chinese Embassy in Germany has repeatedly reiterated these facts and our position to the relevant German authorities. It remains for us to expect that the German side will deal with this objectively and leave no room for further speculation.\u201d \n\n>According to Kall, China\u2019s overseas police stations are often linked to employees of Chinese security agencies. The concern is not about closing traditional police stations, Kall added, but rather about convincing people involved to stop engaging in illegal overseas activities. \n\n>In April, the US Department of Justice charged two Chinese nationals with seeking to set up an overseas police station in New York on behalf of the Fuzhou branch of China\u2019s Ministry of Public Security.",

However, Beijing did acknowledge that it was running so-called service stations in Germany, which it promised to close.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the pledge, China still maintains at least two mobile police stations in Germany whose activities are carefully watched by local authorities, Interior Ministry Spokesman Maximilian Kall said at the conference. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe security authorities are closely monitoring these activities as well as other activities of foreign states in Germany. And this applies in particular and especially to these overseas police stations,\u201d Kall said. \u201cThese are usually not fixed, stationary offices but mobile facilities.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Germany is liaising closely with the US and other European Union member states on the matter and on how to address the extraterritorial activities of Chinese security authorities more broadly, Sasse said. Berlin is also in ongoing talks with China about the issue, she added.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe Chinese government has always upheld international law and respected the sovereignty and jurisdiction of all countries,\u201d according to an embassy statement. \u201cThe Chinese Embassy in Germany has repeatedly reiterated these facts and our position to the relevant German authorities. It remains for us to expect that the German side will deal with this objectively and leave no room for further speculation.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>According to Kall, China\u2019s overseas police stations are often linked to employees of Chinese security agencies. The concern is not about closing traditional police stations, Kall added, but rather about convincing people involved to stop engaging in illegal overseas activities. </p>\n\n<p>In April, the US Department of Justice charged two Chinese nationals with seeking to set up an overseas police station in New York on behalf of the Fuzhou branch of China\u2019s Ministry of Public Security.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Whether they end via negotiations, which can take years, or there are no negotiations and the war continues beyond any decisive period of combat operations, or even when one side attains a fairly clear military victory, they may not be able to quickly translate that victory into a political one, because it\u2019s often up to the loser to decide when the war is over. So even if a decisive battlefield victory or a series of victories are attained, the war can go on as a cross-border war, or a war of attrition between two countries.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://archive.ph/7Vc8u\">Here&#39;s</a> a new interesting interview with Kofman (hopefully the archive link will work, because the original didn&#39;t):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>History is not a perfect guide, but it tells us that when wars last this long, they are typically very difficult to end. Whether they end via negotiations, which can take years, or there are no negotiations and the war continues beyond any decisive period of combat operations, or even when one side attains a fairly clear military victory, they may not be able to quickly translate that victory into a political one, because it\u2019s often up to the loser to decide when the war is over. So even if a decisive battlefield victory or a series of victories are attained, the war can go on as a cross-border war, or a war of attrition between two countries. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to disambiguate between military victory for Ukraine, defeat for Russia, and war termination.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>But in general, I think we understand much better now that the initial Russian invasion was heavily premised on political assumptions that within a matter of days, Ukraine could be forced to surrender and the Ukrainian political leadership could be decapitated.

        "body": "Interesting article on the effects of widespread access to combat videos from Ukraine: https://unherd.com/2023/05/how-war-became-a-spectator-sport/\n\nThe author particularly focuses on critiquing the habit displayed by some social media users wherein they consume videos of violence for little reason beyond a love of gore or fanatical pro-Ukrainian views.\n\n> Brutal as they are, these videos tell you little about the Ukraine war: one contextless video of a human dying in an anonymous ditch is much the same as another, for all it tells you about the conflict\u2019s progress or outcome. The only difference is for online connoisseurs of individual deaths \u2014 praying, pleading, helpless, resigned, crawling away in a trail of blood. This online subculture, a fringe subsection of those following the war, serves no analytical function whatsoever. Instead, it more closely resembles crowds in Roman arenas gawping at the deaths of the condemned: they too, after all, were viewed as criminals, beyond the bounds of human sympathy. The propaganda value of these videos, for the Ukrainian cause, is surely doubtful. For the avoidance of doubt \u2014 or rather, to avoid being accused of pro-Russian sympathies by enthusiasts of this strange and awful new content \u2014 I want Ukraine to win the war. I understand that to do that, the Ukrainians will have to kill and keep killing thousands of Russian soldiers: that\u2019s what war is. But I don\u2019t particularly need or want to see each individual death. The fact that many apparently do tells you little about Ukraine, but much about human nature and the still-dimly understood nature of social media.\n\nTo some extent, I agree with the author's analysis that many people are consuming these videos for the purposes of achieving some morally questionable emotional satisfaction from witnessing the destruction of a hated enemy. I think he misses a step by attributing the fascination with violent videos solely to pro-Ukrainians, because the same phenomenon is absolutely happening on the Russian side, just on Telegram and other social media outlets not as accessible to the author.\n\nMore importantly, I think he is categorically wrong when he states \"Brutal as they are, these videos tell you little about the Ukraine war: one contextless video of a human dying in an anonymous ditch is much the same as another, for all it tells you about the conflict\u2019s progress or outcome.\"\n\nFirst, and most obviously, the videos show us the brutality of the war. I personally find the dehumanizing rhetoric about \"orcs\" and the like extremely offensive and inappropriate. When you view some of these videos without that lens shaping your perspective, it can really drive home the brutal, horrifying reality of the front. Even when you're watching videos of Russians, you know that the Ukrainians are fighting in the same trenches, facing many of the same threats.\n\nSecond, for those of us who approach such videos with a critical eye toward defense implications, the videos can reveal tremendous amounts of information about the capabilities, training, supplies, equipment, and condition of the Russian forces. As one example, we are now well over a year into the trench warfare phase of the conflict, and the Russians still consistently fail to properly establish top cover in their trenches. Despite the stunning volume of drone drop videos available on the internet. That tells you a lot about their average troop quality and explains much of how poorly they are performing as a military. And it tells you something about the prospects for their defensive lines holding against a concerted Ukrainian offensive.\n\nThird (and maybe this is just restating #2), the videos have made it possible for outside observers and the combatants themselves to quickly analyze the tactics employed by both sides, nearly in real time. We know exactly why the Russians repeatedly failed to take Vuhledar, yet in previous wars that level of tactical analysis would likely not have been revealed to the public until well after the war was over and classified combat reports were made public. That in turn drives a much faster OODA loop or adaptation cycle on the combatants. A tactic that works well has a much shorter half life because both sides are able to access such rich information about the battlefield and someone, whether in the military or an outside observer, will think of a reasonable counter. This short OODA loop means the two combatants benefit greatly from the ability to quickly adapt to changing battlefield circumstances. The vast differential between Russian and Ukrainian adaptability likely explains much of the Ukrainian success. They can adopt a tactic and pivot to a new one faster than the Russians can, which means they always retain a tactical edge. \n\nFourth, I would really push back against this point, \"I want Ukraine to win the war. I understand that to do that, the Ukrainians will have to kill and keep killing thousands of Russian soldiers: that\u2019s what war is. But I don\u2019t particularly need or want to see each individual death.\" I think if we condemn people to die, we have a responsibility to witness their death if possible. Shutting our eyes may be more comfortable, but it enables us to accept horrors that we might otherwise resist. I will say, if you can watch a drone drop video and not feel a twinge of horror on behalf of the targets, maybe it's time to stop watching. But if you're like me and feel horror every single time, then I would suggest that it is a moral duty for us to keep watching, if only so that we can bear honest witness to the events in Ukraine and never forget the truly horrific human cost to both sides. \n\nFifth, and this is certainly just a repeat of point #1, the videos show us just how unfair war typically is. In a fight to the death, you do not give your opponent a fair chance to fight back. You hit them where they can't fight back. So when we witness and empathetically share in the desperate feelings of helplessness that targets for drone drops must feel, we are witnessing an essential aspect of warfare. Nearly every combat veteran knows the rage and fear and helplessness of being shelled or shot at or bombed without having the ability to fight back. Nearly every combat veteran that has been in a not-entirely-one-sided fight, at least (so maybe not a lot of Gulf War vets, for example). It's important for civilians to understand that fundamental feature of warfare so that they can understand the true costs of their nation's wars, especially in terms of their impact on veterans.",

From the videos I've seen around Khromove, they seem to use top cover when they are being shelled, then when an assault comes they pop back out to fight. So they dig deeper, bigger dugouts that can resist 152mm strikes, but do not prepare covered fighting positions for individuals to use during infantry combat. The Russians are unable to time their artillery strikes sufficiently tightly with their assaults to force the Ukrainians to fight directly from prepared positions and their use of anti-personnel drone strikes are vanishingly rare, so again the need to prepare individual fighting positions that are drone resistant isn't as important as digging strong points big enough for squads. It's also possible that the Ukrainians may choose not to establish good top cover on their first line of trenches in some cases so that when they are forced to retreat from the trench, it remains vulnerable to their drone drop tactics. They've certainly demonstrated a willingness to practice an elastic defense of such trenches, so it would make sense if they structure their trenches to fit with those tactics.",

I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything necessarily too wrong or damaging about it, but it is pretty cringe.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t have any sort of study to prove this or anything like that, but it&#39;s definitely a strong feeling I get from a significant portion of people in pro-UA spaces. Pro-Russian types are a different, sadder bunch generally already wrapped up in extremist politics, anti-LGBT or incel circles.  </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m never going to begrudge <em>Ukrainians</em> of dehumanizing Russians or policing their language in that regard. Ukrainians actually have to kill them, or suffer having their families murdered by them. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think if we condemn people to die, we have a responsibility to witness their death if possible. Shutting our eyes may be more comfortable, but it enables us to accept horrors that we might otherwise resist. I will say, if you can watch a drone drop video and not feel a twinge of horror on behalf of the targets, maybe it&#39;s time to stop watching.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have a somewhat similar attitude I think. These people actually have to live this horror, and it feels like the least I can do to respect or honor them as a bystander is to at least watch it.</p>\n</div>",

The Republican House bill was to cap topline spending at FY2022 levels. For the DoD, that was $740b, or $100b less than Biden base level request. The US has given anywhere between [$37.6b](https://www.state.gov/u-s-security-cooperation-with-ukraine/) to [$46.6b](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-aid-has-us-sent-ukraine-here-are-six-charts) to [$67.1b](https://www.crfb.org/blogs/congress-approved-113-billion-aid-ukraine-2022) depending on how you measure it. Overall, it has approved $113b in total aid, military and non. \n\nFollowing Rubio's direction, the US would have to cut (a minimum) of $140b from their budget (in 2022 dollars, so probably a little more) to maintain the same level of aid to Ukraine; so a base of $600b for the DoD, or 70% of Biden's request. Except House Republicans are [signalling a boost to Defense spending](https://www.politico.com/minutes/congress/05-15-2023/vets-cuts-counterattack/) for the VA and military construction projects, and the Senate Armed Forces Committee draft NDAA next year [is expected to increase as well.](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/05/10/debt-limit-fight-pentagons-policy-bill-00096264). \n\nSo where would the $140b, possibly $200b, or the House Republican bill proposed $230b in cuts (discretionary spending in FY2023 was $1.7T and FY2022 was $1.47T) expected to come from? Domestic discretionary spending. There's zero chance that a Democratic President would cut $230b in domestic spending even if it could somehow get through the Senate (which with Manchin and Sinema there's a chance). \n\nSo what would happen if it was included in the base DoD? A lot of haggling, and time, and likely less money for Ukraine. But because the budget process is such an arcane mess that most people can't follow, it gives Republicans cover. Instead, by making it a separate supplemental number, it makes them put the US's money where their mouths are; which is why Rubio is trying to squirm out of it.",

Except House Republicans are <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/minutes/congress/05-15-2023/vets-cuts-counterattack/\">signalling a boost to Defense spending</a> for the VA and military construction projects, and the Senate Armed Forces Committee draft NDAA next year <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/05/10/debt-limit-fight-pentagons-policy-bill-00096264\">is expected to increase as well.</a>. </p>\n\n<p>So where would the $140b, possibly $200b, or the House Republican bill proposed $230b in cuts (discretionary spending in FY2023 was $1.7T and FY2022 was $1.47T) expected to come from? Domestic discretionary spending. There&#39;s zero chance that a Democratic President would cut $230b in domestic spending even if it could somehow get through the Senate (which with Manchin and Sinema there&#39;s a chance). </p>\n\n<p>So what would happen if it was included in the base DoD? A lot of haggling, and time, and likely less money for Ukraine. But because the budget process is such an arcane mess that most people can&#39;t follow, it gives Republicans cover. Instead, by making it a separate supplemental number, it makes them put the US&#39;s money where their mouths are; which is why Rubio is trying to squirm out of it.</p>\n</div>",

Detritus around many of the hit guns suggest they had been firing from a single position long enough for Russia\u2019s ponderous command-and-control apparatus to swing into action, ambushing Ukraine\u2019s big guns.\n\n\nBut mobility isn\u2019t the only answer. Russia is also hitting old-school self-propelled artillery systems\u2014guns that can move about under their own power. Both the AHS Krab, a Polish-designed South Korean and British hybrid gun system, and America\u2019s functional equivalent, the hard-working M-109 mobile howitzer, are getting hit rather hard, with **loss rates ranging somewhere between eighteen to twenty-one percent**. With over 180 delivered, at least 36 have been damaged or destroyed.\n\nAgain, imagery of successful Russian strikes suggests roughly half the destroyed mobile howitzers were caught in static firing points or had set into a pattern, operating from detectable positions.\n\nIn contrast, smaller and more mobile artillery platforms don\u2019t seem to be getting hit much at all.\n\n...\n\n\nThe French-built truck-mounted CAESAR 155mm gun has also done well in Ukraine. About 49 of these fast-moving, mobile guns are in Ukrainian service. And while the howitzers have been intensively used, they seem hard for Russia to catch. Open-source researchers have reported only two hits.\n\nAgain, crew staffing these relatively un-armored gun carriages are incentivized to shoot-and-scoot. And, unlike Ukraine\u2019s tracked self-propelled artillery, the wheeled howitzer\u2014while it may not be as \u201cmobile\u201d as a tracked vehicle\u2014is far harder for Russian analysts to track down.\n\n\nThe German Panzerhaubitze (PzH) 2000 155mm self-propelled gun also seems to be avoiding harm. While the gun\u2014the longest-range howitzer yet provided Ukraine\u2014has suffered reliability problems and been forced to occasionally leave the battlefield for repairs, it has also been subject to high use-rates. Despite all the intensive use, only one of the 20 cannons has reportedly been damaged by Russian action.
