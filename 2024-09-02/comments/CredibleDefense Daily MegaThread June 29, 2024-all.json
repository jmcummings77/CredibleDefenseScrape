        "body": "New update on the tactical evolution of the front in Ukraine during June. Today we will analyze the sectors from Kharkiv to Chasiv Yar; tomorrow from Toretsk to Kherson. I have changed the names of several sectors compared with past editions, which will now be named after the main town/city in the direction of Russian attacks. \n\nKharkiv sector. In this sector the Ukrainians are organized competently. The (new) commander of the OTG \"Kharkiv\" (Drapatyi) is capable, as are the vast majority of the brigades deployed here, each of which has its own limited section to cover. The Russians are beating their heads and are on the defensive in basically every area of the sector. If numerous Ukrainian brigades had to rush in here to reinforce the sector, quite a bit of Russian reinforcements also had to arrive here to stabilize the situation, and we are mostly talking about lateral transfers from other sectors.\n\nLet's give a recap of the Russian order of battle in this sector. In the direction of Lyptsi the 11th Corps (18th Motorized Division and 7th Separate Motorized Regiment) is active, along with assault detachments of the \"Africa Corps\" (such as the 408th and 410th). In the direction of Vovchansk, the 82nd Motorized Regiment of the 69th Motorized Division of the 6th CAA (i.e. the former 138th Motorized Brigade), elements of the 25th Motorized Brigade of the 6th CAA (along with the 344th and 346th Regiments of the Territorial Forces) are active. Since late May, the 30th Motorized Regiment of the 72nd Motorized Division of the 44th Corps has been brought into battle, joining the 41st Motorized Regiment of the same division - several of the latter\u2019s subunits have been withdrawn for recovery. In late May, elements of the 128th Motorized Brigade of the 44th Corps as well as the 83rd VDV Brigade entered action. Subsequently, the 155th Naval Infantry Brigade was transferred to the sector (after a R&R period following the battle for Novomykhailivka in the Kurakhove sector - this brigade is also active in the direction of Lyptsi). Elements of the 204th Regiment of the \u201cAkhmat Special Forces\", elements of the 78th Motorized Regiment \"Sever-Akhmat\", as well as the \"Kamerton\" unit of the \"Akhmat Special Forces\" (made up of former Wagnerites), were transferred here from the Chasiv Yar sector. Other units of the \"Akhmat\" galaxy are deployed along the border in Belgorod Oblast, where the 245th Motorized Regiment of the 47th Tank Division of the 1st GTA and elements of the 11th Tank Brigade of the 25th CAA are also active (in border coverage, not in offensive actions). \n\nAnd let\u2019s recall that around Vovchansk there are several units of the 1st GTA - subunits of the 47th Tank Division (elements of the 272nd Motorized Regiment, of the 26th Tank Regiment and of the 153rd Tank Regiment) and of the 2nd Motorized Division (elements of the 1st Motorized Regiment and of the 1st Tank Regiment). The [sight](https://x.com/bayraktar_1love/status/1797945907087901141) of T-80Us in the sector might suggest the presence of elements of one of the tank regiments of the 4th Tank Division as well. \n\nAccording to reports from the \"Northern Channel\u201d (Russian Telegram channel affiliated with troops of the Group of Forces \"North\") of a few days ago, a battalion from the 83rd VDV Brigade is already being brought to the rear for recovery and will be replaced by subunits of the 1009th Regiment of the Territorial Forces (attached to the 6th CAA), which have returned to battle after a quick recovery (soldiers from this regiment complained of very heavy losses during May). \n\nhttps://t. me/severnnyi/1374\n\nhttps://t. me/poisk_in_ua/60664\n\nThis channel had also mentioned the arrival of elements of the 9th Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps (from the Pokrovsk sector), before this was later confirmed by the [update](https://x.com/OSINTua/status/1803094339687514293) of Kriegsforscher (UAV operator of the 36th Marine Brigade), who also mentioned that a battalion of the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade is in the area. The 116th Special Purpose Brigade of the Rosgvardia is active in the area too. This is brigade was created in the second half of 2023 and is the first Rosgvardia unit equipped with tanks. According to the Telegram channel I mentioned above, its 902nd Operational Regiment has been brought to the rear for rest. In addition, the phenomenon of unauthorized abandonments of positions has been highlighted several times, as a result of which military police detachments have arrived in the area.\n\nAccording to Kriegsforscher, in the rear of the sector there\u2019s the 22nd Motorized Regiment, i.e. the third regiment of the 72nd Motorized Division and the only one that has not been committed yet. This considerable deployment of forces hints at the intensity of the fighting in this sector and the need for the Russians, too, to bring reinforcements into the area, as well as being explanatory as to the outcome of the two possible options we were talking about last month - whether the Russians would open a new front in the North or reinforce the current directions of attack. \n\nAs for the Ukrainians, the \"Khartiia\" Brigade of the National Guard and the 92nd Assault Brigade (transferred entirely here from the Lyman and Chasiv Yar sectors, respectively) are carrying out numerous counterattacks against Hlyboke. Elements of the \"Spartan\" and \"Rubizh\" Brigades of the NG are also deployed in the area, as well as of the 5th \"Slobozhansk\" Brigade of the NG. In this sub-sector the Ukrainians have entirely regained control over the dachas along the Travyanske Reservoir and Ukrainian actions have pushed the Russians back to the limits of the built-up area of Hlyboke, with the forest belts to the south and to the west of the settlement currently disputed. The Russians are also blocked just south of Lukiantsi, with the result that Lyptsi is currently protected from any Russian action. Zelene is largely under Ukrainian control - there is the 125th TDF Brigade in the area, as well as battalions of other TDF brigades (such as the 120th and the 127th) and detachments of Border Guards.\n\nThe units fighting in Vovchansk are the 36th Marine Brigade, the \"Tsunami\" Assault Regiment of the \"Lyut\" Brigade of the National Police and battalions of the 82nd Air Assault Brigade and of the 71st Jager Brigade, in addition to the 57th Motorized Brigade. The 414th UAV Battalion (Birds of Madjar) of the Marine Corps is in the area too. There are also smaller units such as the 9th Separate Rifle Battalion and let\u2019s also recall operational units of the HUR, like much of the \u201cKraken\u201d Special Detachment. The \"Stalevy Kordon\" Brigade of the Border Guards covers the area along the course of the Vovcha River to the east of Vovchansk. This week the \"Khorne Group\", which is the UAV unit of the 116th Mech Brigade, has become active in Vovchansk. \n\nThe very fierce urban battle in the town continues. Ukrainians maintain control over the high rises in the central half of Vovchansk north of the Vovcha River, as well as on the sports-recreational complex just south along Soborna Street and around the \"Oasis\" store along Korolenka Street. Last week Ukrainian assault groups managed to recapture some houses a few dozen meters to the north and to the east of the intersection of Soborna and Korolenka Streets. As a reminder, the Ukrainians get to the part of Vovchansk north of the Vovcha River through AVLBs - so far there do not seem to be any problems with the logistics of troops fighting north of the river (who also occasionally bring armored vehicles).\n\nThere are major clashes further south as well. Over the last week soldiers of the 71st Jager Brigade should have regained control over the High School No. 2, eliminating the Russian presence south of Haharina Street in its part to the east of Zhovtneva Street (Russians still control some houses west of it), and thus complicating the situation for Russians located in the Vovchansk Aggregate Plant. Let\u2019s try to clarify the situation in this area. A Russian company (about a hundred men according to Russian sources, belonging to the former 138th Motorized Brigade; for the Ukrainian observer Mashovets about 200 men, including the dead and wounded \u2013 soldiers of the 83rd VDV Brigade according to the \u201cKhorne Group\u201d) is in the plant, occupying its western and central part (which they have fortified) - they had reached Metalista Street with the aim of trying to force the Vovcha, an attempt that ended without any success, and it\u2019s not clear whether they have retained control of the eastern part of the plant. Well, I don\u2019t think we can speak of an encirclement, as the Ukrainians don\u2019t have a stable presence on all of the four sides around the Aggregate Plant, but certainly these men are logistically isolated and supplies are arriving mostly via drone. But in any case the situation is very complicated for the Russians in light of Ukrainian control over the town\u2019s police station north of the plant. Russian armored vehicles were geolocated in Kolokoltsova Street during, most likely, the first half of June, but nowadays that area as well as the Central Park should be in Ukrainian hands. The route by which the Russians got in the plant is Pushkinska Street and Horky Park (just south of it). It\u2019s very likely that the Russians have regained control of this access route on several occasions since the news of the \"encirclement\" came out a couple of weeks ago; anyway there continues to be a Russian presence in the plant at the moment, and the situation may have worsened for them over this week. We shall see how the situation evolves. Second part below.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>New update on the tactical evolution of the front in Ukraine during June. Today we will analyze the sectors from Kharkiv to Chasiv Yar; tomorrow from Toretsk to Kherson. I have changed the names of several sectors compared with past editions, which will now be named after the main town/city in the direction of Russian attacks. </p>\n\n<p>Kharkiv sector. In this sector the Ukrainians are organized competently. The (new) commander of the OTG &quot;Kharkiv&quot; (Drapatyi) is capable, as are the vast majority of the brigades deployed here, each of which has its own limited section to cover. The Russians are beating their heads and are on the defensive in basically every area of the sector. If numerous Ukrainian brigades had to rush in here to reinforce the sector, quite a bit of Russian reinforcements also had to arrive here to stabilize the situation, and we are mostly talking about lateral transfers from other sectors.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s give a recap of the Russian order of battle in this sector. In the direction of Lyptsi the 11th Corps (18th Motorized Division and 7th Separate Motorized Regiment) is active, along with assault detachments of the &quot;Africa Corps&quot; (such as the 408th and 410th). In the direction of Vovchansk, the 82nd Motorized Regiment of the 69th Motorized Division of the 6th CAA (i.e. the former 138th Motorized Brigade), elements of the 25th Motorized Brigade of the 6th CAA (along with the 344th and 346th Regiments of the Territorial Forces) are active. Since late May, the 30th Motorized Regiment of the 72nd Motorized Division of the 44th Corps has been brought into battle, joining the 41st Motorized Regiment of the same division - several of the latter\u2019s subunits have been withdrawn for recovery. In late May, elements of the 128th Motorized Brigade of the 44th Corps as well as the 83rd VDV Brigade entered action. Subsequently, the 155th Naval Infantry Brigade was transferred to the sector (after a R&amp;R period following the battle for Novomykhailivka in the Kurakhove sector - this brigade is also active in the direction of Lyptsi). Elements of the 204th Regiment of the \u201cAkhmat Special Forces&quot;, elements of the 78th Motorized Regiment &quot;Sever-Akhmat&quot;, as well as the &quot;Kamerton&quot; unit of the &quot;Akhmat Special Forces&quot; (made up of former Wagnerites), were transferred here from the Chasiv Yar sector. Other units of the &quot;Akhmat&quot; galaxy are deployed along the border in Belgorod Oblast, where the 245th Motorized Regiment of the 47th Tank Division of the 1st GTA and elements of the 11th Tank Brigade of the 25th CAA are also active (in border coverage, not in offensive actions). </p>\n\n<p>And let\u2019s recall that around Vovchansk there are several units of the 1st GTA - subunits of the 47th Tank Division (elements of the 272nd Motorized Regiment, of the 26th Tank Regiment and of the 153rd Tank Regiment) and of the 2nd Motorized Division (elements of the 1st Motorized Regiment and of the 1st Tank Regiment). The <a href=\"https://x.com/bayraktar_1love/status/1797945907087901141\">sight</a> of T-80Us in the sector might suggest the presence of elements of one of the tank regiments of the 4th Tank Division as well. </p>\n\n<p>According to reports from the &quot;Northern Channel\u201d (Russian Telegram channel affiliated with troops of the Group of Forces &quot;North&quot;) of a few days ago, a battalion from the 83rd VDV Brigade is already being brought to the rear for recovery and will be replaced by subunits of the 1009th Regiment of the Territorial Forces (attached to the 6th CAA), which have returned to battle after a quick recovery (soldiers from this regiment complained of very heavy losses during May). </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a>. me/severnnyi/1374</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a>. me/poisk_in_ua/60664</p>\n\n<p>This channel had also mentioned the arrival of elements of the 9th Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps (from the Pokrovsk sector), before this was later confirmed by the <a href=\"https://x.com/OSINTua/status/1803094339687514293\">update</a> of Kriegsforscher (UAV operator of the 36th Marine Brigade), who also mentioned that a battalion of the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade is in the area. The 116th Special Purpose Brigade of the Rosgvardia is active in the area too. This is brigade was created in the second half of 2023 and is the first Rosgvardia unit equipped with tanks. According to the Telegram channel I mentioned above, its 902nd Operational Regiment has been brought to the rear for rest. In addition, the phenomenon of unauthorized abandonments of positions has been highlighted several times, as a result of which military police detachments have arrived in the area.</p>\n\n<p>According to Kriegsforscher, in the rear of the sector there\u2019s the 22nd Motorized Regiment, i.e. the third regiment of the 72nd Motorized Division and the only one that has not been committed yet. This considerable deployment of forces hints at the intensity of the fighting in this sector and the need for the Russians, too, to bring reinforcements into the area, as well as being explanatory as to the outcome of the two possible options we were talking about last month - whether the Russians would open a new front in the North or reinforce the current directions of attack. </p>\n\n<p>As for the Ukrainians, the &quot;Khartiia&quot; Brigade of the National Guard and the 92nd Assault Brigade (transferred entirely here from the Lyman and Chasiv Yar sectors, respectively) are carrying out numerous counterattacks against Hlyboke. Elements of the &quot;Spartan&quot; and &quot;Rubizh&quot; Brigades of the NG are also deployed in the area, as well as of the 5th &quot;Slobozhansk&quot; Brigade of the NG. In this sub-sector the Ukrainians have entirely regained control over the dachas along the Travyanske Reservoir and Ukrainian actions have pushed the Russians back to the limits of the built-up area of Hlyboke, with the forest belts to the south and to the west of the settlement currently disputed. The Russians are also blocked just south of Lukiantsi, with the result that Lyptsi is currently protected from any Russian action. Zelene is largely under Ukrainian control - there is the 125th TDF Brigade in the area, as well as battalions of other TDF brigades (such as the 120th and the 127th) and detachments of Border Guards.</p>\n\n<p>The units fighting in Vovchansk are the 36th Marine Brigade, the &quot;Tsunami&quot; Assault Regiment of the &quot;Lyut&quot; Brigade of the National Police and battalions of the 82nd Air Assault Brigade and of the 71st Jager Brigade, in addition to the 57th Motorized Brigade. The 414th UAV Battalion (Birds of Madjar) of the Marine Corps is in the area too. There are also smaller units such as the 9th Separate Rifle Battalion and let\u2019s also recall operational units of the HUR, like much of the \u201cKraken\u201d Special Detachment. The &quot;Stalevy Kordon&quot; Brigade of the Border Guards covers the area along the course of the Vovcha River to the east of Vovchansk. This week the &quot;Khorne Group&quot;, which is the UAV unit of the 116th Mech Brigade, has become active in Vovchansk. </p>\n\n<p>The very fierce urban battle in the town continues. Ukrainians maintain control over the high rises in the central half of Vovchansk north of the Vovcha River, as well as on the sports-recreational complex just south along Soborna Street and around the &quot;Oasis&quot; store along Korolenka Street. Last week Ukrainian assault groups managed to recapture some houses a few dozen meters to the north and to the east of the intersection of Soborna and Korolenka Streets. As a reminder, the Ukrainians get to the part of Vovchansk north of the Vovcha River through AVLBs - so far there do not seem to be any problems with the logistics of troops fighting north of the river (who also occasionally bring armored vehicles).</p>\n\n<p>There are major clashes further south as well. Over the last week soldiers of the 71st Jager Brigade should have regained control over the High School No. 2, eliminating the Russian presence south of Haharina Street in its part to the east of Zhovtneva Street (Russians still control some houses west of it), and thus complicating the situation for Russians located in the Vovchansk Aggregate Plant. Let\u2019s try to clarify the situation in this area. A Russian company (about a hundred men according to Russian sources, belonging to the former 138th Motorized Brigade; for the Ukrainian observer Mashovets about 200 men, including the dead and wounded \u2013 soldiers of the 83rd VDV Brigade according to the \u201cKhorne Group\u201d) is in the plant, occupying its western and central part (which they have fortified) - they had reached Metalista Street with the aim of trying to force the Vovcha, an attempt that ended without any success, and it\u2019s not clear whether they have retained control of the eastern part of the plant. Well, I don\u2019t think we can speak of an encirclement, as the Ukrainians don\u2019t have a stable presence on all of the four sides around the Aggregate Plant, but certainly these men are logistically isolated and supplies are arriving mostly via drone. But in any case the situation is very complicated for the Russians in light of Ukrainian control over the town\u2019s police station north of the plant. Russian armored vehicles were geolocated in Kolokoltsova Street during, most likely, the first half of June, but nowadays that area as well as the Central Park should be in Ukrainian hands. The route by which the Russians got in the plant is Pushkinska Street and Horky Park (just south of it). It\u2019s very likely that the Russians have regained control of this access route on several occasions since the news of the &quot;encirclement&quot; came out a couple of weeks ago; anyway there continues to be a Russian presence in the plant at the moment, and the situation may have worsened for them over this week.

            "body": "In the recent weeks the Ukrainians have also made progress in the eastern part of Vovchansk, eliminating any Russian presence south of Korolenka Street, with these retreating to the houses further north and in the area near the graveyard. Further east the Ukrainians drove the Russians out of Starochudnoho Street, moving them considerably away from the Vovcha River. The situation in Tykhe was clarified - it always remained under Ukrainian control, with Russian forward positions located in the woods north-west of the settlement. No Russian activity is reported further east. \n\nThe 42nd Mech Brigade and 101st Brigade for the Protection of the General Staff are active in Starytsya, where counterattacks against Russian positions have been underway over these weeks. The latters have driven the Russians away from the Starytsya River and appear to have regained control of the central part of the settlement. Around Hatyshche the Russians are blocked and are unable to force the Vovcha (which flows into the Siversky Donets right there) in the direction of Synelnykove.\n\nA couple of Russian actions (in terms of DRGs - sabotage and reconnaissance groups) in other areas along the border are noteworthy: earlier this month in Ryzhivka, Sumy Oblast, by forces of the 1434th Regiment of the Territorial Forces (\"Akhmat-Chechnya\"). This village is a grey area usually, like almost all those others along the border, and as explained by DeepState the hydrographic conformation around it (it\u2019s squeezed by several rivers/streams that do not make it easy for Ukrainians to get there) make it prey, from time to time, to Russian incursions, which then eventually leave. Something similar happened in the last few days in Sotnytskyi Kozachok, Kharkiv Oblast (which is a handful of hundred meters from the border): a Russian DRG infiltrated the village and was then driven out by Ukrainian border guards. This is business as usual along the border, after all.\n\nElements of Ukraine\u2019s new 150th and 151st Mech Brigades have likely been deployed in Kharkiv Oblast (one battalion each of the latter is also in the Chasiv Yar sector and in Zaporizhzhia Oblast), in addition to the mobile fire group of the 153rd Mech Brigade. There are also elements of the 23rd Mech Brigade and a battalion of the 31st Mech Brigade. It also appears that elements of 100th Mech Brigade have brought to this sector, probably to cover the border while restoring combat capabilities after the battles near Avdiivka of the last months.\n\nKupyansk sector. Elements of the 25th Motorized Brigade of the 6th CAA and some regiments of the Territorial Forces attached to the 6th CAA are still deployed in this sector. They are trying both to advance into the forest south of Lyman Pershyi along the railway (in the direction of the small Synkivka railway station \u2013 which is not in the village), without success; and east of Synkivka in the direction of Petropavlivka, with success: subunits of the 25th Brigade this week captured the \"Kryuk\" strongpoint, advancing more than 1,5 km from their initial positions. \n\nhttps://t. me/EjShahidenko/2949\n\nThere was then an Ukrainian counterattack to the east of this area with unclear outcomes; in any case, it\u2019s clear that after failing to attack Synkivka directly and despite the transfer of much of the 6th CAA in Vovchansk, the Russians continue to attack and keep alive this direction of attack. The Russians' goal is to gain control over the small valleys formed by the streams that then flow onto the Hnylitsa, a tributary of the Oskil, and the hills from where they originate further east - to then approach Petropavlivka from both east and north and put Synkivka in an uncomfortable position.\n\nThe 14th and 116th Mech Brigades are defending this area along with TDF units and separate rifle battalions; also in the area there is the 2nd Mech Battalion of the 30th Mech Brigade; in addition to the 32nd Mech Brigade, elements of which are beginning to move to Donetsk Oblast as far as I have found (it\u2019s not clear yet in which sector).\n\nThe 1st GTA, whose main forces are still deployed in the eastern part of the Kupyansk sector, continues to apply pressure. Elements of the 26th Tank Regiment and elements of the 272nd Motorized Regiment of the 47th Tank Division are attempting to advance towards Stepova Novoselivka, both by advancing along the Kupyansk-Svatove railway from the south-east and from Ivanivka, i.e. from the north-east, with minor successes. At the moment Stepova Novoselivka remains in Ukrainian hands though, defended by the 43rd Mech Brigade (together with by a battalion of the 114th TDF Brigade and elements of the 4th Tank Brigade), with elements of the 110th TDF Brigade active in the area further south. The 15th Motorized Regiment and elements of the 1st Tank Regiment of the 2nd Motorized Division have made no further progress this month, after having occupied much of Berestove last month. \n\nBorova sector. The 27th Motorized Brigade of the 1st GTA has likely consolidated control over the eastern end of Novoselivske, which was a grey area, but no further advances are recorded, despite numerous Russian attacks. The wedge between Berestove, Novoselivske and Stelmakhivka is defended by Ukraine\u2019s 77th Airmobile Brigade. The 423rd Motorized Regiment of the 4th Tank Division of the 1st GTA continues to attack Stelmakhivka. Russian sources report that they have managed to enter some houses in the latter village, but this is not confirmed either by Ukrainian sources or geolocations. Last weeks the Russian MoD had claimed to have occupied Miasozharivka and Andriivka (two hamlets south of Stelmakhivka, the last of which is on the western bank of the Zherebets). Here, too, there is no confirmation. This area is defended by the 44th Mech Brigade.\n\nThe offensive of the 3rd Motorized Division of the 20th CAA continues in this sector. The bulk of the 3rd Assault Brigade is deployed here (1st Assault Battalion and 1st and 2nd Mech Battalions) and is repelling the numerous and constant Russian attacks, along with smaller units such as elements of the \"Rubizh\" Brigade, the 2nd Rifle Battalion of the 3rd Tank Brigade and the 22nd Special Purpose Battalion of the Separate Presidential Brigade. Not much is said about this (at least until DeepState wrote about it the last week) because the Ukrainians are doing a good job, but the intensity of Russian attacks is very high. The 752nd Motorized Regiment is attacking the Nadiia/Novoyehorivka area, without success; the 252nd Motorized Regiment is attacking the Makiivka area, with little progress south-east of the settlement. The 237th Tank Regiment and regiments of the Territorial Forces are providing support. \n\nYesterday DeepState notified a Russian advance of up to 1,3 km in the direction of Nevske, further south. In this area the Russians already controlled the watershed between the Zherebets and the Balka Vedmezha (a tributary of the Krasna) and thus had an elevation advantage. The advance should be the work of units of the 144th Motorized Division of the 20th CAA, and the area should be defended by the 66th Mech Brigade.\n\nLyman sector. In the last days DeepState clarified the situation in the Terny and Yampolivka area, reporting of a large Ukrainian advance (on average between 1 and 1,5 km) that occurred mainly in April along the forested ravines to the east of Zherebets. In this area the Russians have lost the initiative; units of the 144th Motorized Division are regrouping after major losses in recent months (the 1428th Regiment of the Territorial Forces is in the area too). It\u2019s clarified that in the forested ravine known as \"Mitten\" (the third, from the north) there is no Russian presence, as Motopatriot (Russian map-maker) had been claiming for months. The bulk of the 95th Air Assault Brigade, the 21st and 60th Mech Brigades, the 2nd Assault Battalion of the 3rd Assault Brigade, separate rifle battalions such as the 38th and 44th are active in this area.\n\nUnits of the 67th Motorized Division of the 25th CAA continue to attack in the direction of Torske, without any notable success. This area is defended by the 63rd Mech Brigade along with several TDF units. Ukraine\u2019s 67th Mech Brigade was recently moved to this sector. The 115th Mech Brigade after a brief rest following the events of April was also transferred here, specifically to the Serebrianka Forest, near Dibrova. According to reports from fighters of the \"Bureviy\" Brigade, the brigade is perfoming quite well. Let\u2019s recall that in April its commander was replaced. \n\nhttps://t. me/officer_alex33/3081\n\nThe successes of the \"Bureviy\" and \"Azov\" Brigades of the NG were made public this month, which recorded advances in the Serebrianka Forest during April (with advances between 1 and 2 kms). Today DeepState also published news of another advance by the \"Azov\" Brigade: up to 1 km in the area of Chumatskyi Yerik and Hnyle Lakes, just north of the course of the Siversky Donets. By now these two units, especially \u201cAzov\u201d, have become real specialists in fighting in that forest, which has a unique set of difficulties compared to other areas. The Russians in the forest are considerably weakened after the transfer of numerous units to other sectors - at the moment the forest is covered by elements of the 67th Motorized Division and by the 169th Motorized Brigade of the 25th CAA (the 164th Motorized Brigade of the 25th CAA is in the Dibrova area). Given the failure to drive the Ukrainians out of the eastern bank of the Zherebets and the issues in the Serebrianka Forest, we can consider Russian ambitions towards Lyman, which seemed much more realistic earlier this year, a distant dream.

The Russians in the forest are considerably weakened after the transfer of numerous units to other sectors - at the moment the forest is covered by elements of the 67th Motorized Division and by the 169th Motorized Brigade of the 25th CAA (the 164th Motorized Brigade of the 25th CAA is in the Dibrova area). Given the failure to drive the Ukrainians out of the eastern bank of the Zherebets and the issues in the Serebrianka Forest, we can consider Russian ambitions towards Lyman, which seemed much more realistic earlier this year, a distant dream.

                "body": "\nSiversk sector. No new successes for the Russians in Bilohorivka, firmly defended by the 81st Airmobile Brigade. Only many human and material losses, trying to enter in what remains of the private sector, attacking from the industrial area. The chalk quarry is firmly in Ukrainian hands. The filtration station along the Siversky Donets River is likely under Ukrainian control too, by the way. The village is like a new Synkivka for the Russians (the 7th Motorized Brigade of the 2nd Corps is attacking here). Further south, the 54th Mech Brigade continues to hold its positions between Verkhnokamyanske and Spirne, repelling attacks by the 6th Motorized Brigade of the 2nd Corps. \n\nThe situation on the southern slope of this salient is more complicated, though. The 137th and 119th Airborne Regiments of the 106th VDV Division are attacking Rozdolivka, which is being defended by units of the 10th Mountain Assault Brigade, a battalion of the 54th Mech Brigade, the 466th Rifle Battalion of the 143rd Infantry Brigade and by the 23rd Special Purpose Battalion of the Separate Presidential Brigade. After capturing the large trench south of the village, Russian paratroopers managed to enter the village. At the moment much of it\u2019s likely a grey area (the Russian MoD declared the capture of the entire village). The Russians should have consolidated control in the southern part (they entered from the east) and are trying to clear the rest of the village, while there might still be an Ukrainian presence in the northern end, along Tolochkova Street. Russian paratroopers have also advanced along the Siversk-Soledar railway south-west of Rozdolivka, capturing some Ukrainian trenches. The trenches between the Bakhmutovka River and the Siversk-Soledar railway to the west of Rozdolivka remain under Ukrainian control. The 30th Mech Brigade defends the western bank of the Bakhmutovka River, preventing Russian advances in that area.\n\nFurther east, the 51st Airborne Regiment of the 106th VDV Division is attacking along the hills north of Vesele, achieving successes during this month, advancing nearly 2 km, according to DeepState, from its original positions just north of the Sukha Plotva River. The 123rd Motorized Brigade of the 2nd Corps continues to push towards Vyimka, advancing more than 1,5 km during this month along the Siversk-Nyrkove railway, capturing some Ukrainian strongpoints held by the 10th Mountain Assault Brigade. The Russians' objective here is clear: to finish conquering the heights north of Vesele and after that advancing in the direction of Siversk along the valleys where the two aforementioned railroads pass, given the failures to approach Siversk from the east.\n\nChasiv Yar sector. The 200th Motorized Brigade of the 14th Corps is engaged in battles inside Kalinina, defended by Ukraine\u2019s 56th Motorized Brigade. The situation is quite fluid: several times the Russians have advanced inside the village to be later pushed back. The Russians attempted on one further occasion a mechanized attack to cross the Donets-Donbas Canal, without success. At the moment, Russian forward positions should be in the center of the village, with a limited Ukrainian infantry presence in the western part. Hill 228 and the cattle breeding buildings around it are still in Ukrainian hands.\n\nInside Kalinina a Bradley was destroyed in the first half of June, almost surely belonging to the 425th Assault Battalion \"Skala\" (I found a MIA notice of one of its soldiers in Kalinina). Probably a company from the battalion arrived in the sector during this month. Another company is active in Krasnohorivka (Kurakhove sector) and another near Volodymyrivka (Vuhledar sector). The \"Skala\" Battalion yesterday released a video showing a pair of Russian soldiers in the area where the canal passes in overground pipes, in the forest between Kalinina and the Bakhmut - Chasiv Yar railway. It's unclear how they got there, whether by passing through the forest from Kalinina or through potential secondary pipes connected to those, but I\u2019d rule out that the Russians consolidated positions in that area and this small group was later defeated.\n\nhttps://t. me/WarArchive_ua/16672\n\nThe bulk of the 24th Mech Brigade was recently deployed to Chasiv Yar, replacing much of the 41st Mech Brigade (as we shall see tomorrow too), which was the main unit directly protecting Chasiv Yar and fighting in the Kanal District. The 41st Mech Brigade had arrived here at the end of March from Kupyansk and after two and a half months of fighting was starting to need some rest. Therefore it was decided to move it to the Toretsk sector, taking over positions from the 24th Mech Brigade, which had been holding that sector for over a year and was quite fresh (a battalion of the 24th Brigade had already been fighting near Bohdanivka for months). \n\nAssault groups of the 98th VDV Division and of the Cossack Volunteer Assault Corps (the Assault and Recon Brigades \"Hispaniola\u201d, \"Sever-V\u201d and \"Vostok-V\") are active inside and around the Kanal District of Chasiv Yar. During the first half of the month they recorded successes here - conquering the high rises east of Zrazkova Street and the former bus factory north of them. The Ukrainians retreated to the high rises west of Zrazkova Street and the forest north of Koshovoho Street. In recent days Russian sources have been reporting further minor advances - two high-rises north of St. Borys and Hlib Church and the area between the former bus factory and the forest mentioned above, along the Bakhmut \u2013 Chasiv Yar railway. According to a geolocation released today, Russian stormtroopers entered the first among the high rises west of the church. The other mentioned progress is confirmed too.\n\nhttps://t. me/creamy_caprice/5930\n\nhttps://t. me/EjShahidenko/2967\n\nChasiv Yar is also defended by units of the \"Lyut\" Brigade: the \"Luhansk-1\" Assault Regiment and the \"Tavr\" Assault Battalion. Let\u2019s recall that the Police recently [formed]( https://militaryland.net/news/police-forms-three-infantry-brigades/) three new combat brigades, most likely in light of the upcoming mobilization of 10% of its personnel that was approved this month (policemen will go to combat units of the National Police). There are also units from the HUR (such as the \u201cArtan\u201d Special Unit) as well as the 225th Separate Assault Battalion.\n\nThe 11th VDV Brigade is attacking in the direction of the Novy District, from its forward positions near the destroyed bridge of Highway T0504 over the canal and in the forest above it, attempting to cross the canal, without success: no Russian presence has ever been recorded in the western bank and Ukrainian fortifications there are very strong. The 18th Brigade \"Sloviansk\" of the NG is active in this area.\n\nIn the area south of Ivanivske, units of the 150th Motorized Division of the 8th CAA (the 102nd Motorized Regiment and the 68th Tank Regiment) and at least the 3rd Battalion of the 78th Motorized Regiment \"Sever-Akhmat\" are committed. On the Ukrainian side, the 5th Assault Brigade is active along with the units, especially of the TDF, attached to it, such as the 244th Battalion of the 112th TDF Brigade and the 212th Battalion of the 101st TDF Brigade. Despite the withdrawal of the 92nd Assault Brigade, the Ukrainians are showing themselves capable of holding the line there.\n\nThe 3rd Corps and units of the 2nd Corps continue to push against Klishchiivka and Andriivka. The first village is defended mainly by the 22nd Mech Brigade and other smaller units. Russian successes here stopped. The situation is similar to how it looked like in Robotyne the past few months. Much of the village is a grey area, with Russian control in the northern part and Ukrainian presence in the southern end. Russian progress is hampered by the Ukrainian forward positions in the forest to the west of the village as well as by their control of the heights to the north-west. There is in fact no Russian progress - the important Hill 215 and the part of the large trenches system around it that the Ukrainians have been holding during 2024 remain firmly under them.\n\nThe 93rd Mech Brigade has occupied positions near Andriivka previously held by the 92nd Assault Brigade. The current situation inside Andriivka is not entirely clear. It\u2019s probably a grey area, or with a sporadic Ukrainian presence. There is no Russian progress anyway in the direction of Hill 220. Ukrainian resilience in this area is proving critical for the hold of the Toretsk sector, which we will analyze tomorrow.",

Other additional changes like the police allowing for greater recruitment and conscription of its officers have allowed for several new police assault brigades to begin being formed (These brigades are generally specialized for assault and urban fighting and have so far performed well). Prisoners can now be recruited with several thousand joining so far and up to 20k estimated to be eligible. The additional recruits and more Western and domestic equipment have allowed Ukraine to strengthen under-strength units and begin forming new mech brigades again. The current changes should provide enough manpower to sustain the army for at least the next year and IMO maybe up to two years if further changes are made. Overall the Ukrainian manpower shortage has been relieved at least in the medium term.",

There have been very few videos of gun-launched ATGMs actually used in this war. TOW on the other hand was the best ATGM of the Cold War and can still kill any Russian AFV with the -2B downward firing EFP warhead.\n\nAnd of course, a far superior thermal imager and fire control system. Having better situational awareness is a key aspect of being able to engage first, and then get out of dodge when the situation gets too dangerous. I don't know if you've seen Russian thermal imagers, but they typically have a tiny screen and pretty piss-poor contrast. Sensors is an area which is a 'soft stat' but which is an enormous advantage of Western weapons systems and has an outsized impact on the battlefield.",

The 25 mm has a APFSDS &#39;long-rod&#39; dart that can punch through the front of every Russian IFV and APC, whereas the 30 mm APDS rounds the Russians use would struggle with the Bradley&#39;s glacis.</p>\n\n<p>BMP is dependant on gun-launched ATGMs for long range work, and they always have issues with &#39;capturing&#39; the missile (getting it under guidance) due to the dust kicked up by firing. There have been very few videos of gun-launched ATGMs actually used in this war. TOW on the other hand was the best ATGM of the Cold War and can still kill any Russian AFV with the -2B downward firing EFP warhead.</p>\n\n<p>And of course, a far superior thermal imager and fire control system. Having better situational awareness is a key aspect of being able to engage first, and then get out of dodge when the situation gets too dangerous. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve seen Russian thermal imagers, but they typically have a tiny screen and pretty piss-poor contrast. Sensors is an area which is a &#39;soft stat&#39; but which is an enormous advantage of Western weapons systems and has an outsized impact on the battlefield.</p>\n</div>",

                "body": "Here is an article that gives reasons why you would go with a manned aircraft over unmanned.  \n\n[Manned vs. Unmanned Aircraft: Which is Best for Aerial Data Acquisition?](https://woolpert.com/news/blogs/manned-vs-unmanned-aircraft-which-is-best-for-aerial-data-acquisition/)\n\n*Suitability for Large and Small Projects: Project size and budget should dictate the size of the aircraft used for data acquisition. Smaller projects like corridor mapping can benefit from smaller aircraft with lower operation costs. Larger aircraft can be brought in for projects that require endurance and a sophisticated, heavy payload, like lidar sensors and metric digital cameras.*\n\n*Capability of Carrying High-End Mapping Sensors: Manned aircraft are suitable for carrying multiple sensors. The more sophisticated sensors necessary for accurate, high-resolution mapping products, like lidar sensors and metric digital cameras, are too heavy for unmanned systems.*\n\n*Airspace-Friendly Operations: With the proper authorization from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) air traffic control, manned aircraft can fly over almost any project. Unlike UAS, manned aircraft has fewer restrictions when flying over people.*\n\n*Safe Operations: Today\u2019s manned aviation is much safer than UAS operations. This is the main reason why the FAA restricts UAS flights over people.*\n\nAnd here is one from a few years ago that compares the Global Hawk to the manned U-2.\n\n[U-2 Versus Global Hawk: Why Drones Aren't Always The Best Solution For Warfighters | Forbes | 2018](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lorenthompson/2018/02/05/u-2-versus-global-hawk-why-drones-arent-always-the-best-solution-for-warfighters/)\n\n*The U.S. Air Force has been struggling of late to determine whether manned or unmanned aircraft are best suited to generating useful intelligence on the modern battlefield. Its two most capable options are the manned U-2S spy plane, which traces its lineage to the early days of the Cold War, and the Global Hawk unmanned aircraft -- by far the most capable intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance drone in the world.*\n\n*...Sure enough, the Global Hawk offers exceptional endurance. In fact, it holds the Air Force record for continuous hours of flight without refueling (34 hours).

                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Here is an article that gives reasons why you would go with a manned aircraft over unmanned.  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://woolpert.com/news/blogs/manned-vs-unmanned-aircraft-which-is-best-for-aerial-data-acquisition/\">Manned vs. Unmanned Aircraft: Which is Best for Aerial Data Acquisition?</a></p>\n\n<p><em>Suitability for Large and Small Projects: Project size and budget should dictate the size of the aircraft used for data acquisition. Smaller projects like corridor mapping can benefit from smaller aircraft with lower operation costs. Larger aircraft can be brought in for projects that require endurance and a sophisticated, heavy payload, like lidar sensors and metric digital cameras.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Capability of Carrying High-End Mapping Sensors: Manned aircraft are suitable for carrying multiple sensors. The more sophisticated sensors necessary for accurate, high-resolution mapping products, like lidar sensors and metric digital cameras, are too heavy for unmanned systems.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Airspace-Friendly Operations: With the proper authorization from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) air traffic control, manned aircraft can fly over almost any project. Unlike UAS, manned aircraft has fewer restrictions when flying over people.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Safe Operations: Today\u2019s manned aviation is much safer than UAS operations. This is the main reason why the FAA restricts UAS flights over people.</em></p>\n\n<p>And here is one from a few years ago that compares the Global Hawk to the manned U-2.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/lorenthompson/2018/02/05/u-2-versus-global-hawk-why-drones-arent-always-the-best-solution-for-warfighters/\">U-2 Versus Global Hawk: Why Drones Aren&#39;t Always The Best Solution For Warfighters | Forbes | 2018</a></p>\n\n<p><em>The U.S. Air Force has been struggling of late to determine whether manned or unmanned aircraft are best suited to generating useful intelligence on the modern battlefield. Its two most capable options are the manned U-2S spy plane, which traces its lineage to the early days of the Cold War, and the Global Hawk unmanned aircraft -- by far the most capable intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance drone in the world.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>...Sure enough, the Global Hawk offers exceptional endurance. In fact, it holds the Air Force record for continuous hours of flight without refueling (34 hours). However, once you get beyond how long the unmanned option can stay up there, the U-2 turns out to be superior in virtually every other measure. As a result, the Air Force has recently decided to kill plans for its retirement, and keep using U-2 in places like Korea and the Persian Gulf indefinitely.</em> </p>\n\n<p><em>...What the data show is that U-2S is by many measures the most capable ISR plane any nation operates, and decidedly superior to Global Hawk.

Most sources conclude that <strong>the Soviet Union had intended to conquer all of Finland....Following initial setbacks, the Soviets reduced their strategic objectives.</strong></p></li>\n<li><p>World opinion largely supported the Finnish cause, and the Soviet aggression was generally deemed unjustified.</p></li>\n<li><p>The USSR was expelled from the League of Nations and was condemned by the international community for the illegal attack. <strong>Foreign support for Finland was promised, but very little actual help materialised</strong>, except from Sweden. </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>The Soviets had a 3:1 advantage in manpower and a 5:1 advantage in artillery</strong>, as well as air supremacy.</p></li>\n<li><p>By the terms of the treaty, <strong>Finland ceded 9% of its national territory and 13% of its economic capacity</strong> to the Soviet Union. <strong>Finland avoided total conquest of the country by the Soviet Union and retained its sovereignty.</strong></p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A &quot;win&quot; for Ukraine means maintaining sovereignty without losing everything east of the Dnipro. They likely are not getting back any territory Russia currently holds.</p>\n</div>",

Russia logistics also rely HEAVILY on the UAZ-452 (loaf/bukhanka) and while Oyrx doesn't record those losses, Andrew Perpetua does and they lose like 5-10 every day. That's a role that'd be well served by the Tigr-M and yet it's only seen pretty rarely. If they had 1400+ Tigr-Ms sitting around I'd expect them to be used at least somewhat more. \n\n\nhttps://x.com/AndrewPerpetua/status/1806928627360993322",
