But that can't be mass issued or used for training because it's too expensive, so they created both high pressure and low pressure ammo for training and non-near peer threats (no plates).

Milley wanted range because he figured grunts and scouts shouldn't need to wait till 100 m to score a center mass kill shot. Based on unbelievably stupid reasoning masquerading as science, Milley and his sycophants used data to decide that they needed to be able to get a one shot center mass kill on Russian dismounts or else Eastern Europe was lost.

Additional historical research added even more to that than my military experiences did. </p>\n\n<p>NGSW carbine especially is NOT meant for a kilometer or more, it&#39;s meant for 600 meters and under, with the ability to penetrate a NIJ Level IV ballistic plate out to that range (which the XM5 won&#39;t accomplish, it&#39;s muzzle velocity is drastically shy of the 3,400 fps needed). 600 meters was chosen because that&#39;s already the max effective range of the infantry rifle squad, that&#39;s what we were already responsible, especially with SAWs and DM rifles.</p>\n</div>",

I wish the Army picked 6.5 Creedmoor, but they did the engineering and decided on .277 Sig\n\nThis goes so much further back then you realize.\n\nFirst, 6.8 as a desired carbine caliber width was decided in the early 2000s as the \"perfect\" intermediate caliber. Not as slick as 6.5 but better lethality and barrier penetration, whereas 7mm was too big and slow, 6mm too light. But that was back when SOCOM and Crane were doing tests, not Big Army, and it was mostly focused on whether to adopt 6.8 SPC, which nearly happened but didn't because it wasn't a big enough improvement to justify it. \n\nMilley's ICRS in 7.62 led into the NGSW which was spec'd at 6.8 long before Sig even created their hybrid .277 Fury round, or General Dynamics made it's polymer cased 6.8 load, or Textron made their telescoping caseless 6.8 round. Because the Army didn't specify anything other than a bullet diameter, weight, ogive (they gave them all the AP bullet it was meant to fire) along with muzzle velocity specs **that neither Sig, GD, or Textron met.'**\n\n6.8 whatever was preordained with NGSW, which Big Army was pushing, with Milley being the patron that was going to see it passed and issued before his term ends, hence the rush to mass issue a carbine, machine gun, and scope that still have barely been tested, especially with full pressure AP loads. \n\nThey picked Sig not because it was the best ammo (GD was because it was only slightly slower but much lighter, cheaper, etc). And not because the XM5. But mainly because the XM250 was MUCH better than the GD bullpup magazine fed AR, which the Marines liked but the Army hated. And the Textron was ruled out all together because the ammo was too controversial. That meant it was between SIG and GD. But not individual aspects, the whole package, as each manufacturer submitting bids needed to include four elements together as a package, their proprietary 6.8 cartridge, carbine, automatic rifle and suppressor. SIG wasn't the best, it was the least shitty when all four were compared. Plus, SIG offered cheaper prices, which is why they recently won a bunch of other major mil purchases and will continue winning more, they can undercut competitors.\n\n6.5 Creedmoor was NEVER in competition with 6.8, it was being promoted by SOCOM for sniper rifles and potentially light machine guns to replace 7.62 NATO. I'm pretty sure its going to get issued too. \n\n>On the now M5 rifle - I wish they would have worked on an internally beefed-up AR-10, instead of the XM5.\n\nThe M5 is basically a beefed up AR-10. It's a modified MCX, SIG's gas piston AR, using the same receiver, mags, etc as their existing 7.62 NATO version, with some springs, bolt and barrel being a little different. That's why .277 Fury is called 6.8x51, because 7.62 NATO is also known as 7.62x51. In comparison, .277 Fury has a slightly modified case with the same overall length as 7.62 NATO so it fits in the same mag and receiver as 7.62 NATO. That's why it needs the hybrid case with steel case head and aluminum washer fitted to otherwise brass case so it can handle the ridiculously high pressures the Army's velocity requirement stipulated. Which SIG still didn't meet, under the spec muzzle velocity by 300 fps.\n\nFun fact, as specified, NGSW wanted .270 Weatherby Magnum velocities out of a 14.5\" barreled carbine or light machine gun, with no more weight or recoil than an M4 or M249, along with other impossible requirements, which is why nobody met those requirements remotely and only three manufacturers even bothered to try. \n\nI've been following this shitshow since the ICSR, nobody ever thought this was going to get issued because it's been a bad joke from the beginning...",

That's it.\n\nBut laser range finders don't give accurate readings unless on specialized backgrounds. There is no way to know the wind from the scope, to know that means calculating mirages, spinning wind meters like a kestrel, scanning the area for various signs like certain vegetation moving in certain ways, and even then it's an art not a science. And density altitude only matters for long range shots when the rifle is properly, dead on balls zeroed, which in combat is rare for a grunt but when snipers desperately try to confirm at least weekly. \n\nSo what the individual possessing that XM5 rifle/scope combo is essentially the same as someone given a questionably zeroed M4 with 1-6x DVO optic, Mk262 match ammo, and told to fire at a known distance target at any range from 0-600 meters. Very easy to miss because making hits can't utterly discount every other aspect of marksmanship besides knowing elevation set and knowing the wind hold but not the actual wind.\n\nTo put that in perspective, the existing US Army rifle qualifications shoots out to 300 meters. Scopes are allowed. Using a 200-300 meter zero, the shooter can aim center mass and hit the target without needing to adjust. Wind isn't given but at those ranges it's only problematic at 250-300 meters. Even then, most Soldiers barely qualify. Why? Because the fundamentals of marksmanship actually matter and are quite hard to learn and master, and the hardware solutions that best overcome them don't involve $15,000 scopes (there is a reason top snipers wanted better bipods and tripods and weren't the ones pushing for anything like the XM157). \n\nOr let's take a USMC qualification. After two weeks of training, a full week of live fire practice, then comes qualification day. Shooters know the range, they can even tell the wind using multiple flags that hang everywhere that databooks with formulas that translate wind flag angle to miles per hour and direction, with other formulas that tell you how much to adjust for that at specific ranges. And even then many barely qualify, only a minority shoot expert, and shooting a perfect score has only been done a handful of times.\n\nIt's why those trying out to be snipers or designated marksmen are supposed to qualify as rifle experts before they are given the job, because even with a very sweet rifle/scope/ammo combo, shooting mostly from bipod and sand sock supported prone, with known range and rather accurate wind call, it's still hard as hell to shoot well on the qualification course unless the shooter already excels at the basic fundamentals, which are surprisingly extremely difficult to master and can't be done by a hardware purchase, which is what the Army decided to do with NGSW. \n\nFYI, I've dealt with this subject professionally in both the US Marines and Army, with LOTS of advanced training, trigger time, and many years as an instructor, for rifle marksmanship in particular. I'm an actual subject matter expert on this topic. Not the best of the best, but I definitely know what I'm talking about.",

When the vehicles would be operational is also unclear, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive issue.\n\n>The White House didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n>Kyiv has been asking allies for tanks, longer-range missiles, armor and air defense systems, with Russia\u2019s war now in its 11th month. Fighting continues on the ground in the east even as the onset of winter slows advances by either side, leaving Moscow resorting to missile strikes against the country\u2019s energy and civilian infrastructure. Russia launched dozens of cruise missiles on Ukrainian cities on Thursday in one of its heaviest barrages of the war, though Ukraine said it shot down most of them.\n\n>Ukrainian officials have warned that Russia might be gearing up for a fresh offensive in the spring. Equally, the warmer weather might allow Kyiv\u2019s forces to again press the advantage, having pushed Russian forces back out of areas they occupied in the early days of the war.\n\n>Still, some of Ukraine\u2019s allies have been reluctant to send Kyiv all of the more advanced weapons it has been asking for, out of concern it could prompt Moscow to escalate further, or potentially draw other countries into the conflict more directly.\n\n>\u201cBradleys would provide a major increase in ground combat capability because it is, in effect, a light tank,\u201d said Mark Cancian, a former White House defense budget analyst who\u2019s now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cUnlike the previously provided M113s, the Bradley is heavily armed with a powerful 25mm gun and TOW anti-tank missiles. The United States has many Bradleys, though some are older and need upgrades, so inventories are not a problem.\u201d\n\n>Cancian added it would be months before Ukraine could field them because crews and maintainers would need to be trained on the vehicles, which are built by BAE Systems PLC.\n\n>The US also has announced plans to send a Patriot missile battery to Ukraine. But it\u2019s also unlikely to be ready to use before the spring, due to the time it takes to train Ukrainian troops on the system, the people said.\n\n>Michael Allen, who held national security policy roles during the presidency of George W. Bush, said providing Ukraine with the fighting vehicles would be \u201csignificant because most experts are forecasting that the war will be more like Kherson than Kharkiv, that is to say more grinding and incremental than a break through a weak line and recapturing hundreds of square miles.\u201d\n\n>>\u201cBradley is fast and maneuverable and suits our political objectives to give the Ukrainians weapons to hasten the end of the war,\u201d according to Allen, who is now managing director of Beacon Global Strategies, an advisory firm. \u201cAlso, Ukraine is desperate for armor generally.\u201d",

Russia launched dozens of cruise missiles on Ukrainian cities on Thursday in one of its heaviest barrages of the war, though Ukraine said it shot down most of them.</p>\n\n<p>Ukrainian officials have warned that Russia might be gearing up for a fresh offensive in the spring. Equally, the warmer weather might allow Kyiv\u2019s forces to again press the advantage, having pushed Russian forces back out of areas they occupied in the early days of the war.</p>\n\n<p>Still, some of Ukraine\u2019s allies have been reluctant to send Kyiv all of the more advanced weapons it has been asking for, out of concern it could prompt Moscow to escalate further, or potentially draw other countries into the conflict more directly.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cBradleys would provide a major increase in ground combat capability because it is, in effect, a light tank,\u201d said Mark Cancian, a former White House defense budget analyst who\u2019s now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cUnlike the previously provided M113s, the Bradley is heavily armed with a powerful 25mm gun and TOW anti-tank missiles. The United States has many Bradleys, though some are older and need upgrades, so inventories are not a problem.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Cancian added it would be months before Ukraine could field them because crews and maintainers would need to be trained on the vehicles, which are built by BAE Systems PLC.</p>\n\n<p>The US also has announced plans to send a Patriot missile battery to Ukraine. But it\u2019s also unlikely to be ready to use before the spring, due to the time it takes to train Ukrainian troops on the system, the people said.</p>\n\n<p>Michael Allen, who held national security policy roles during the presidency of George W. Bush, said providing Ukraine with the fighting vehicles would be \u201csignificant because most experts are forecasting that the war will be more like Kherson than Kharkiv, that is to say more grinding and incremental than a break through a weak line and recapturing hundreds of square miles.\u201d</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cBradley is fast and maneuverable and suits our political objectives to give the Ukrainians weapons to hasten the end of the war,\u201d according to Allen, who is now managing director of Beacon Global Strategies, an advisory firm. \u201cAlso, Ukraine is desperate for armor generally.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

An early variant Bradley with competent operators was able to take out two T-72s with TOWs and then pull out of range faster than the 72s could respond. Historically people have blamed Iraqi operators but the IRG division at 73 Easting was no joke, and it does seem that the superior US tech was what made it such a one-sided beating (although all else being equal I'm sure 2nd ACR was even better trained and would have won decisively in any case). \n\nSubsequent upgrades to the Bradley have likely been more valuable than those to the T-72, so they have likely accumulated even more of an advantage over the intervening 30 years. e.g., they can be equipped with Javelins with a range of 4.75km, whereas the T-72 main cannon probably can only manage 2-3km under optimistic conditions. Just imagine how 2nd ACR would have performed against Iraqi T-72s with those slapped onto their Bradleys. \n\nThe same logic applies to the other less numerous Russian MBTs in service, and the Bradley's 25mm cannon can handle anything else in the Russian ground arsenal. Which it seems largely consists of BMPs and human meat with an optional layer of crumbling concrete at this point. The M2's armor can stand up to most of their infantry weapons including RPGs, at least when equipped with reactive armor. They're reasonably mine-resistant if equipped with the Urban Survival Kit that comes with extra underside armor, and if they don't come with that upgrade they can just not be used as the lead vehicle during an assault or at risk convoy. Russian artillery is increasingly shit for accuracy as they're stretching barrel life to the limit, so that's not as much of a threat (or at least no more so than it would be to any armored vehicle at all, in that any armored vehicle should be able to handle 152mm splinters from near misses but not necessarily direct hits). Plus some of the upgraded variants have anti-missile defense systems to counter Russian ATGMs. Traditional Russian CAS is pretty non-existent and inaccurate because of toss bombing. Not sure how Bradleys stack up against Lancets but I'm guessing there aren't enough Lancets for the question to matter, because they're reserved for higher value targets like artillery or AD.\n\nBest of all, we have like 6000 of them sitting around, far more than we will ever need. It just seems like one of those no-brainer transfers that leave us all scratching our heads why the Biden administration hasn't pulled the trigger on it earlier. Like PATRIOT batteries or F-16s or ATACMS or M1 Abrams. But its cheaper than any of those options (except maybe ATACMS), with more of a chance to make an immediate impact on the battlefield, with fewer complications around road/bridge weight limits than the Abrams, and fewer complications around escalation overall. I can't imagine the logistics train is complicated enough to overcome all those advantages. \n\nI continue to suspect the administration is more focused on managing optics around escalation when choosing what systems to transfer to Ukraine than it is on making operationally sound decisions. In this case, their escalation concern being that if the Ukrainians charge into Russian lines riding distinctively American (or German or British or French) tanks, it will reinforce the Russian disinformation campaign suggesting that they are fighting a war against NATO. But that's nonsense and everyone outside Russia knows it. The Coalition forces did not blame the USSR for the Iraqi T-72s during Desert Storm, for example.",

If either of those are the primary reason they're still attacking especially since the September-November defeats, they're a drain simply for being done for stupid purposes. They'd still act as a fixing operation inadvertently, but if it's unintentional then it's unplanned wastage even if it ends up having some operational value (tying up UAF units and supplies defending Bakhmut instead of attacking Svatove-Kreminna). \n\n>Do you think they're husbanding resources that aren't being pushed onto this offensive, dispersing them, or just incapable of massing them?\n\nYes, but not a massive force in reserve.\n\nFrom what I've heard, and I might be off, of the forces that were in the Kherson bridgehead, some were rotated out to the strategic rear for rest and reconstitution, while others were sent to the Svatove-Kreminna area (including some VDV, which is telling). 3rd Army Corps and some BARS reservists are still in the Svatove-Kreminna area too. Plus an unknown number of the Mobiks for sent to that area too, probably a good chunk of those that were sent over early in October and November, with others in Kherson or Zaporizhzhia oblasts defending against a Dnieper River crossing or an attack towards Melitopol or Mariupol. \n\nBack in the strategic rear in Russia, either right over the border, in Belarus, or at their home stations, are all the conscripts who never deployed, plus about half the Mobiks (many training in Belarus), any other BTG that didn't deploy or were sent home, the Ukraine veteran units sent to the rear for R&R. \n\nZaluzhnyi told the Economist he thinks the Russians are building a massive offensive force behind the Urals, but that's just bullshit to try to get the West to give more military aid (Kofman recently said the same thing). \n\nOverall, I think the emergency that caused all the major strategic adaptations done between Sept-Nov is still present, Russia can't go back on the offensive until they actually stabilize the front and remove the possibility of another Ukrainian operational level victory, which doesn't happen until the Svatove-Kreminna offensive threat ends. \n\nIf I'm right, then the strategic thinking is to commit most of their reserve of manpower and supplies to stave off that defeat, done either by defending the sector in question or by an active defense, attacking other Ukrainian sectors to try to keep the initiative while also forcing the Ukrainians to shift forces and focus to defend.\n\nIf true, it pays to bait major offensive capabilities because then the UAF keep more forces and resources in reserve, especially in OC-N if they truly fear a Russian offensive there in the next couple months.\n\nHowever, the Ukrainians have no reason to take that offensive threat serious, because it's ludicrous and not really that dangerous either, but they also have every reason to publicly act like they believe that rumor is true, a PSYOP campaign to make the Russians think their deception plan is working. \n\n>Also more generally interested in why a concentration of artillery around Bakhmut would mean a rationing of shelling across other parts of the front. What's the bottleneck, munitions, supply, tubes, or crews?\n\nThat can be many reasons besides logistical issues. \n\nFor instance, if the Russians are only attacking in Bakhmut and a few other places on a regular basis, artillery expenditure elsewhere should be very low. In \"quiet sectors\" like on the Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk oblasts lines, if there is no indication of massing UAF forces (which there doesn't seem to be) then other than artillery duelling, which is usually done in advance of an offensive to gain artillery superiority, then fires expenditure should be low.\n\nEveryone seems to be comparing fires now to mid summer at their highest. While I don't believe at all the 50-60k/day fire rates the UAF put out, whatever the rates were they'd be high because the Russians were doing a broad front fires centric offensive along most of the Donbas salient, while defending against a UAF counteroffensive in the Kherson bridgehead, and trying to retake/stabilize Kharkiv after the May UAF counteroffensive there. The only \"quiet sector\" in all of Ukraine was Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk oblasts, which still saw regular battalion sized attacks by both sides, plus artillery duelling. So whatever the rates actually were then they'd be much higher than now simply because more was happening.\n\nThat said, Rob Lee, Michael Kofman, and some other analysts have been saying since October that their earlier estimates of Russian ammo stores were too high as it turns out they suffered from lots of powder charge wastage, so are now suffering legit theater wide ammo shortages. Kofman especially believes that to be driving much of Russian strategic decision making, though I'm not so sure myself. \n\nIn terms of other aspects, between gun crew personnel attrition, maintenance issues, higher echelon overhaul like barrel replacement, and resupply of new guns due to combat write-offs, I'm not aware how that is affecting them, though I'm sure it is, and it's probably not great. \n\nPrewar, Russia and Ukraine both had 2-3x the artillery in their maneuver units than the US, UK, and Germany do (though a few NATO countries had similar). Russia also has lots of separate artillery brigades and regiments at the CAA/army/corps level on top. So my guess is attrition of crew and guns has them operating at 25-50% at best, which funny enough roughly brings them in line with US amounts. Those crazy numbers for Russia and Ukraine are why both are consuming artillery ammo at such high rates, it's the equivalent of putting three belt fed machine guns in a squad instead of just one. There are pro and con for that, and the biggest con is it's nearly impossible to resupply other than the best case scenario.",

What&#39;s the bottleneck, munitions, supply, tubes, or crews?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That can be many reasons besides logistical issues. </p>\n\n<p>For instance, if the Russians are only attacking in Bakhmut and a few other places on a regular basis, artillery expenditure elsewhere should be very low. In &quot;quiet sectors&quot; like on the Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk oblasts lines, if there is no indication of massing UAF forces (which there doesn&#39;t seem to be) then other than artillery duelling, which is usually done in advance of an offensive to gain artillery superiority, then fires expenditure should be low.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone seems to be comparing fires now to mid summer at their highest. While I don&#39;t believe at all the 50-60k/day fire rates the UAF put out, whatever the rates were they&#39;d be high because the Russians were doing a broad front fires centric offensive along most of the Donbas salient, while defending against a UAF counteroffensive in the Kherson bridgehead, and trying to retake/stabilize Kharkiv after the May UAF counteroffensive there. The only &quot;quiet sector&quot; in all of Ukraine was Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk oblasts, which still saw regular battalion sized attacks by both sides, plus artillery duelling. So whatever the rates actually were then they&#39;d be much higher than now simply because more was happening.</p>\n\n<p>That said, Rob Lee, Michael Kofman, and some other analysts have been saying since October that their earlier estimates of Russian ammo stores were too high as it turns out they suffered from lots of powder charge wastage, so are now suffering legit theater wide ammo shortages. Kofman especially believes that to be driving much of Russian strategic decision making, though I&#39;m not so sure myself. </p>\n\n<p>In terms of other aspects, between gun crew personnel attrition, maintenance issues, higher echelon overhaul like barrel replacement, and resupply of new guns due to combat write-offs, I&#39;m not aware how that is affecting them, though I&#39;m sure it is, and it&#39;s probably not great. </p>\n\n<p>Prewar, Russia and Ukraine both had 2-3x the artillery in their maneuver units than the US, UK, and Germany do (though a few NATO countries had similar). Russia also has lots of separate artillery brigades and regiments at the CAA/army/corps level on top. So my guess is attrition of crew and guns has them operating at 25-50% at best, which funny enough roughly brings them in line with US amounts. Those crazy numbers for Russia and Ukraine are why both are consuming artillery ammo at such high rates, it&#39;s the equivalent of putting three belt fed machine guns in a squad instead of just one. There are pro and con for that, and the biggest con is it&#39;s nearly impossible to resupply other than the best case scenario.</p>\n</div>",

                "body": "Interesting! Hard to tell who is approaching whom because of the lack of perspective. I'm not familiar enough with the J-11 to read its control surfaces perfectly in a blurry video like this, but it does look like its rudders are slightly hinged to the right. Meaning the actual control surface is sticking out past vertical on the starboard/right side of the stabilizer, which induces drag on that side, slowing it down relative to the port side. Bottom line it looks like it was yawing slightly right toward the RC-135. Which would never, ever be the safe or correct maneuver in this scenario, even if it were a legitimate peacetime intercept of a potentially hostile nation's aircraft over territorial waters.\n\nI don't know about international or Chinese regulations, but in the US, the intercepting aircraft is responsible for maintaining a safe flying distance. Which means it's on the J-11 in this case, unless we believe a fat, old, 1960s-era, cargo-bus airframe can catch up with a fourth gen Chinese fighter and is the intercepting party in this case. Under FAA regs, the intercepting pilots are supposed to avoid any extreme maneuvers near the intercepted aircraft out of sensitivity to the fact that routine maneuvers for fighter jets can seem exceedingly threatening and dangerous to operators of other aircraft. They are supposed to maintain a **minimum of 500 feet of separation**, even when initiating what is known as a \"divert maneuver,\" where they fly in front of the intercepted aircraft at close distance and turn in the general direction they want the intercepted aircraft to turn. Notably it is also initiated from slightly below the intercepted aircraft, not at all like what the J-11 is doing here. In any case, a divert maneuver is a last ditch option only ever used under exceedingly exigent circumstances. Basically if they have exhausted other methods of communication and are at the point where they would try to signal to the other pilot by getting this close, they should probably just be shooting it down, because then they aren't risking the safety of the interceptor as well.\n\nRight at the end of the clip you can see the Rivet Joint descend a few feet, and it's definitely the RJ dropping and not the J-11 rising, because the J-11's control surfaces appear static and the two planes' relative airspeeds stay constant which means neither pilot is fucking with their throttle enough to cause the distance to open up. After that, you can see the J-11's elevators (seemingly?) hinge up a little, so it's pulling up and away at that point, but it's clear that the RJ was the first to take evasive action to avoid the collision and that the J-11 was actively steering into them before they did. \n\nBut ultimately of course the video just tells us the obvious because we all know no one is crazy enough to play chicken with a huge, hard to control, expensive surveillance aircraft against a nimble modern jet fighter, and the Chinese have a long history of pulling exactly this bullshit. We just usually don't get to see such good video of it so soon after the incident.\n\nEdit: [relevant US regulation is here](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap5_section_6.html), under section 5-6-13. Just reread it and I don't think I misstated anything, but it has more detail than I provided of course.",

You go all-in on building yourself (Ukraine) as a fiercely independent nation, you purge everything that Putin might use against you, you promote your Ukrainian history, and yes, as icky as it might be, you need to be very nationalistic, because otherwise when Putin comes knocking and you know that he will, it&#39;s just a matter of time, your nation will not survive otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>Now Ukrainians did everything of the above to survive, to make sure they have a fighting chance.</p>\n\n<p>We were all very surprised by the Ukrainian unanimous resistance while we were busy scolding them for being too nationalistic in 2014-2022. We weren&#39;t paying attention.</p>\n</div>",

And by this lot we mean, lot as in critical amounts. Their military will take long years to rebuild, if they will have the money and imports for it, which is unlikely they will have.</p>\n</div>",

Also keep in mind that \"range\" is relative and depends on the target. For example, the Russian ABM missile system (S-300V) has a range of 40 km against ballistic missiles. When you see huge distances quotes, that's for the 40N6E missile, which is for targeting aircraft at long ranges. Longer range missiles are a lot bigger. The 40N6E is over 2 tons, so you would have to have a compelling reason to haul something like that around. It takes larger trucks, and you significantly reduce the number of missiles you can carry. Also keep in mind that at 400 km range, you're beyond the effective range of most ground-based radar sets depending on the target altitude, so these are really only useful for a large and integrated defense system where you can position your launchers to support a radar that's a long distance away. Russia knows they know they can't effectively oppose western airforces in the air so they needed giant interceptors with multiple overlapping radar coverage to get area denial. The US doesn't need that kind of range so they would rather have something smaller they can move around more easily with a greater magazine depth. The MIM-104C has a range of >160km and you can put the launcher on a trailer, so it's pretty well matched to move around with the radar in a battery. One place the US does need a long range missile to match the range of ground-based radars is in the Navy, so they use the SM-6 with a range >240km. Again, they could make a bigger missile with a longer range but then they would sacrifice the depth of magazine, which is super important on ships.",
