      "selftext": "The r/CredibleDefense daily megathread is for asking questions and posting submissions that would not fit the criteria of our post submissions. As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster. Don't abuse it though! If something is not obviously against the rules but you still feel that it should be reviewed, leave a short but descriptive comment while filing the report.",

The judge has not ruled on whether Teixeira can be held without bond, and a second hearing has been set for Friday.\n\n>Teixeira, 21, an airman first class who was assigned to the 102nd Intelligence Wing, is accused of leaking top-secret Pentagon documents on Discord, a social media platform primarily used by online gamers. The case has sparked furor internationally, leading to questions about America\u2019s ability to guard its secrets.\n\n>Teixeira, who has not entered a plea, was arrested April 13 and could face a prison sentence upward of 25 years if convicted, previous court filings by the prosecution have said.\n\n>In September, six months before his detention, Teixeira was seen \u201ctaking notes on classified intelligence information\u201d before putting the notes into his pocket, according to an Air Force memo written at the time, submitted to the court by prosecutors Wednesday.\n\n>Teixeira\u2019s superiors asked him if he intended to share the notes, before telling him at a meeting to \u201cno longer take notes in any form on classified intelligence information,\u201d the memo said.\n\n>A month later, another Air Force memo said the airman had failed to do this, \u201cpotentially ignoring the cease-and-desist order on deep diving into intelligence information\u201d when he asked \u201cvery specific questions\u201d during an internal briefing. He was told to focus on his job, it said, and to stop making \"deep dives\" into classified information.\n\n>Finally in February, a colleague saw Teixeira operating a machine connected to the Department of Defense\u2019s Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communication System, its internal system for sharing confidential information, a third Air Force memo said. He was seen \u201cviewing content that was not related to his primary duty\u201d and was instead \u201crelated to the intelligence field,\u201d it said.\n\n>Two of Teixeira's commanders have been suspended from duty.\n\n>In their filing, prosecutors also acknowledge that the background check for his security clearance failed to detect \u201cthe significant volume of racist, antisemitic, and violent rhetoric he posted online.\u201d\n\n>The filing is signed by Massachusetts U.S. Attorney Rachael Rollins, who has announced her intention to resign this week after having been found to have committed serious misconduct in office unrelated to the Teixeira case.\n\n>Prosecutors have previously called the defendant \u201ca serious flight risk,\u201d and warned that a \u201cforeign adversary\u201d could try to help him escape the United States and give him safe haven.\n\n>Last month, a federal judge declined to immediately free him from custody, but did not rule on the matter.\n\n>Teixeira\u2019s lawyers made their own submission of documents Wednesday, providing a list of eight defendants involved in other Espionage Act cases where courts have approved their pretrial release.\n\n>Teixeira should not be compared with Edward Snowden, the exiled American who stole classified information from the National Security Agency, as the prosecution has sought to do, the defense team said. Snowden \u201cfled the country\u201d before his arrest and was already in China at the time of his leak, it said, having \u201corchestrated a coordinated plan to seek asylum in other countries,\u201d it said.\n\n>The defense has also said there is no allegation he ever intended for documents to be distributed widely.\n\n>In response to this, the prosecution said that there were 150 users on the server where Teixeira is alleged to have shared his information, and it \u201cnow may have many more users that are actively seeking access to classified information,\u201d their memo said.\n\n>\u201cAmong the individuals with whom the Defendant shared government information are a number of individuals who represented that they resided in other countries and who logged on to the social media platform using foreign IP addresses.\u201d\n\n>In messages, Teixeira bragged about the scope of information he had access to, writing, \u201cThe information I give here is less than half of what\u2019s available,\u201d prosecutors said. He also acknowledged he wasn\u2019t supposed to be sharing the information, prosecutors said, writing in another message, \u201cAll of the s\u2014- I\u2019ve told you guys I\u2019m not supposed to,\u201d according to the Justice Department\u2019s filing.\n\n>Teixeira is charged with unauthorized retention and transmission of national defense information and with unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or materials, according to court records. Prosecutors have called this \u201can incredibly large and damaging dissemination of classified national defense information\u201d that could be used by American adversaries against it.\n\n>In another filing late last month, prosecutors said Teixeira: had a history of making violent and racist remarks \u2014 including posting on social media about wanting to carry out a mass shooting; keeping \"an arsenal of weapons\" and tactical gear at his house; and trying to thwart federal investigators by apparently destroying evidence.\n\nBased on this, it seems like a lot of corporations have more stringent safeguards for protecting their information and are also less tolerant of breaches than the U.S. military.",

He was seen \u201cviewing content that was not related to his primary duty\u201d and was instead \u201crelated to the intelligence field,\u201d it said.</p>\n\n<p>Two of Teixeira&#39;s commanders have been suspended from duty.</p>\n\n<p>In their filing, prosecutors also acknowledge that the background check for his security clearance failed to detect \u201cthe significant volume of racist, antisemitic, and violent rhetoric he posted online.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The filing is signed by Massachusetts U.S. Attorney Rachael Rollins, who has announced her intention to resign this week after having been found to have committed serious misconduct in office unrelated to the Teixeira case.</p>\n\n<p>Prosecutors have previously called the defendant \u201ca serious flight risk,\u201d and warned that a \u201cforeign adversary\u201d could try to help him escape the United States and give him safe haven.</p>\n\n<p>Last month, a federal judge declined to immediately free him from custody, but did not rule on the matter.</p>\n\n<p>Teixeira\u2019s lawyers made their own submission of documents Wednesday, providing a list of eight defendants involved in other Espionage Act cases where courts have approved their pretrial release.</p>\n\n<p>Teixeira should not be compared with Edward Snowden, the exiled American who stole classified information from the National Security Agency, as the prosecution has sought to do, the defense team said. Snowden \u201cfled the country\u201d before his arrest and was already in China at the time of his leak, it said, having \u201corchestrated a coordinated plan to seek asylum in other countries,\u201d it said.</p>\n\n<p>The defense has also said there is no allegation he ever intended for documents to be distributed widely.</p>\n\n<p>In response to this, the prosecution said that there were 150 users on the server where Teixeira is alleged to have shared his information, and it \u201cnow may have many more users that are actively seeking access to classified information,\u201d their memo said.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAmong the individuals with whom the Defendant shared government information are a number of individuals who represented that they resided in other countries and who logged on to the social media platform using foreign IP addresses.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In messages, Teixeira bragged about the scope of information he had access to, writing, \u201cThe information I give here is less than half of what\u2019s available,\u201d prosecutors said. He also acknowledged he wasn\u2019t supposed to be sharing the information, prosecutors said, writing in another message, \u201cAll of the s\u2014- I\u2019ve told you guys I\u2019m not supposed to,\u201d according to the Justice Department\u2019s filing.</p>\n\n<p>Teixeira is charged with unauthorized retention and transmission of national defense information and with unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or materials, according to court records. Prosecutors have called this \u201can incredibly large and damaging dissemination of classified national defense information\u201d that could be used by American adversaries against it.</p>\n\n<p>In another filing late last month, prosecutors said Teixeira: had a history of making violent and racist remarks \u2014 including posting on social media about wanting to carry out a mass shooting; keeping &quot;an arsenal of weapons&quot; and tactical gear at his house; and trying to thwart federal investigators by apparently destroying evidence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Based on this, it seems like a lot of corporations have more stringent safeguards for protecting their information and are also less tolerant of breaches than the U.S. military.</p>\n</div>",

Also claims he tried to talk Putin out of doing it if you wanna believe him.\n\nTo get to my actual point - according to that interview Putin actually believes the more outrageous things he says. Its not just propaganda for the masses, insteadhe's been surrounded by yes-men for so long that he's now trapped in a (dis)information bubble.

Its not just propaganda for the masses, insteadhe&#39;s been surrounded by yes-men for so long that he&#39;s now trapped in a (dis)information bubble.

        "body": "Source: Le Monde, roughly translated \n\nWar in Ukraine: Can Russian Air Force Still Change the Course of the Conflict?\n\nThe Russian aerospace forces are equipped with a large number of aircraft, incommensurate with what Ukraine has. But they suffer from handicaps that limit their destructive potential against kyiv's counter-offensive.\n\n\nThis is one of the main unknowns of the Ukrainian counter-offensive, announced since the end of winter and expected by summer: will Russia commit its air forces to counter the troops of Kyiv? Can Moscow's superiority in combat aviation jeopardize the reconquest of Ukrainian territory? \"If the Ukrainians lose part of the umbrella offered by anti-aircraft equipment, the VKS [Voenno Kosmitcheskie Sily or Aerospace Forces of the Russian Federation] will have free rein to pose a serious and credible threat to the Kiev offensive\" , warns Benjamin Gravisse, political scientist and creator of the blog \"Red samovar\", devoted to Russian military issues.\n\nOn paper, the potential of the VKS was little affected by the war in Ukraine. Since the beginning of the conflict, the Russians have never really sought to conquer the Ukrainian skies, for reasons of doctrine as well as capabilities. Result: the VKS lost \"only\" 82 combat aircraft, mainly Sukhoi Su-25 and Sukhoi Su-34, and 87 helicopters, mainly Kamov Ka-52 \"Alligator\", according to the Oryx site, which lists the material losses of the two belligerents on the basis of visual evidence. Figures that may seem significant \u2013 for comparison, France has a fleet of around 225 fighters (air force and navy combined) \u2013 but which remain moderate given the resources of the Russian army.\n\n\nAccording to the Military Balance, a yearbook published by the British think tank International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), which details each year the state of military arsenals in the world, Russia had a fleet of more than 1,300 planes combat before the war. \"While the Russian ground forces have paid a very heavy price since the start of hostilities, the VKS, despite significant losses, still have a potential close to that existing before February 2022\", assures Benjamin Gravisse, recalling that Russia can complete its squadrons with new aircraft from its aeronautical factories.\n\nThe Kyiv arsenal under tension\n\nThis persistence of Russian potential is all the more worrying as doubts are emerging about the state of Ukrainian anti-aircraft defenses. Since the fall of 2022, Russia has been harassing the surface-to-air batteries of the kyiv army by sending waves of drones and missiles to Ukraine. On the night of Monday 15 to Tuesday 16 May, around twenty projectiles were still fired at the country's capital. Russia even assured that one of its missiles had hit one of the Patriot anti-aircraft batteries provided by the West, a claim confirmed by the Pentagon, which assured that the damage was minor and the system was operational again.\n\nWhile these strikes have little strategic effect, they put pressure on Ukrainian ammunition stocks. In a classified February document leaked to the Discord platform in April, the Pentagon estimated that \"Ukraine's ability to provide medium-range air defense to protect [front lines] will be completely reduced by here on May 23.\" Since then, Westerners have accelerated their deliveries of surface-to-air ammunition, but the kyiv arsenal remains under tension. \u201cUkraine may have to choose tomorrow between defending its cities or protecting its counter-offensive,\u201d worries Vincent Tourret, research fellow at the Foundation for Strategic Research (FRS).\n\nHowever, military analysts say they are relatively skeptical about the VKS's ability to hinder a major counter-offensive. Unlike Westerners, who have made control of the skies a prerequisite for any action on the ground, the Russians consider the air force primarily as an auxiliary to their artillery. They therefore did not carry out massive strike campaigns at the beginning of the conflict, which would have made it possible to destroy Ukraine's air and anti-aircraft capabilities. However, it is difficult to maneuver in the presence of enemy aircraft. \"Russian pilots will always find it difficult to approach the front if they do not at least partially deny the sky to Ukrainians,\" said IISS researcher Yohann Michel.\n\nShortage of experienced pilots\n\nTo make matters worse, the Russian pilots have shown, since the start of the conflict, significant shortcomings in terms of the support of their ground troops, preferring to stay away from the front and fire missiles at Ukrainian fixed positions. This is firstly due to a lack of combined arms training which is a dominant feature within the Russian army, but also due to difficulties in targeting enemy positions. \u201cThe Russians have few means of target designation and they are often reduced to lasers, which only work in clear weather and close to the objectives. That's why the VKS have a lot of trouble aiming at moving targets,\" says Vincent Tourret. The lack of inter-arms coordination also increases the risk of friendly fire, a fear for Russian pilots.\n\nFor analysts, the lack of experienced pilots also reduces the intervention capabilities of the VKS. \u201cGiven the limited number of flying hours and the practice of unit training, the VKS entered the conflict with less than 100 fully trained and active pilots. Coupled with a military culture that assigns the most dangerous missions to the most experienced aircrew, attrition within the VKS has disproportionately affected these cadres, reducing the force's overall effectiveness and its ability to train new pilots.\" , reads a report by the British think tank RUSI (Royal United Services Institute), published in November 2022.\n\nRussian shortcomings in maintenance - so-called \"maintenance in operational condition\" in the armies - are also a limiting factor. According to various studies, the availability rate of Moscow aircraft was estimated before the war at less than 50%, a relatively low figure compared to those of the West: that of French combat aircraft was 81% in 2021, according to a parliamentary report published in February. \u201cA fourteen-month high-intensity war is testing materials and men. The availability rates of Russian aircraft were not good before the conflict, they must not have improved since, \u201dassures Yohann Michel.\n\nIn the Western staffs, they also say they are confident about the resilience of Ukrainian anti-aircraft capabilities, whose interception rates, above 75%, are considered \"very good\". Thanks to Western aid, Kyiv troops have equipment capable of threatening Russian aircraft in just about any configuration, what the military calls \"multi-layered\". \"It would take an air steamroller to destroy the Ukrainian ground-to-air defense, whose mesh remains strong, with a risk of colossal losses for the Russians\", estimates a French military source, recalling that \"even an experienced pilot cannot don't enjoy entering an enemy surface-to-air bubble.\"",

I assume they're accurate:\n\n> You know, based on what I've seen there, we need to say honestly and clearly that we have to change the aims of the special operation.\n\n> We said we wanted demilitarisation and denazification but in actual fact there's full nazification there! There's no other ideology there! That's it! If you've said something different there, then apologise.\n\n> And there's full militarisation. In Europe there's not a single country which is more militarised now.\n\n> So we should have two aims, as far as I see it. The first aim is for us to liberate those who want to be liberated. Those people do exist and there are plenty of them in Ukraine. They're just keeping silent because they have no choice.

The discussions \u2014 while provisional \u2014 have taken place across various U.S. agencies and in the White House.\n\n>It\u2019s a scenario that may prove the most realistic long-term outcome given that neither Kyiv nor Moscow appear inclined to ever admit defeat. It\u2019s also becoming increasingly likely amid the growing sense within the administration that an upcoming Ukrainian counteroffensive won\u2019t deal a mortal blow to Russia.\n\n>A frozen conflict \u2014 in which fighting pauses but neither side is declared the victor nor do they agree that the war is officially over \u2014 also could be a politically palatable long-term result for the United States and other countries backing Ukraine.\n\n>It would mean the number of military clashes would fall, the costs of supporting Kyiv also likely would drop, and public attention to the war would wane.\n\n>\u201cWe are planning for the long term, whether it looks frozen or thawed,\u201d said a U.S. official familiar with the Biden administration\u2019s discussions on Ukraine. The official said such planning is a growing focus of the administration, whereas in past months \u201cit was all about the urgent and short-term.\u201d\n\n>Two other U.S. officials and a former Biden administration official confirmed that an extended freeze in fighting is one possibility for which the U.S. is preparing. U.S. officials also are thinking through the long-term security ties Washington will have with Kyiv, as well as Ukraine\u2019s relationship with the NATO military alliance.\n\n>\u201cThere\u2019s a school of thought that says, \u2018Oh, the Ukrainians have to have [the city of] Mariupol and Azov Sea access.\u2019 There\u2019s others less hung up about the placement of the lines as long as Ukraine is secure going into the future,\u201d the former administration official said, describing the internal conversations.\n\n>Such discussions remain in early stages, with the U.S. officials stressing that the war will remain hot for quite some time and that the Biden administration is intent on providing Ukraine with the weapons and support it needs to push the Russians out of as much territory as possible.\n\n>Still, even the suggestion of such planning could undermine Ukrainian leaders\u2019 confidence in America\u2019s continued commitment to their cause, especially given agitation among some Republicans to lessen support for Kyiv.\n\n>A fifth person, a senior Biden administration official speaking on behalf of the White House, said an array of contingency plans are being weighed, but the situation is fluid and the only safe prediction is that Russia will not conquer Ukraine. Like others interviewed, the official was granted anonymity to describe sensitive issues.\n\n>While many U.S. officials avoid publicly talking about how the Russia-Ukraine conflict will evolve, Joint Chiefs Chair Gen. Mark Milley has repeatedly predicted that it will end in negotiations, not a military victory for either side.\n\n>And the makeup of recent military aid packages to Ukraine reflects the Biden administration\u2019s shift to a longer-term strategy, a Defense Department official said.\n\n>The amount of equipment sent directly from existing U.S. stockpiles has steadily diminished over the past few months, while the packages of aid used to purchase new weapons from industry \u2014 a process that can take months to years \u2014 has increased.\n\n>The Biden administration recently transferred $300 million worth of weapons from existing U.S. stockpiles, primarily ammunition, while providing $1.2 billion to purchase more complex weapons, such as air defenses, from industry.\n\n>At the moment, Ukraine is preparing a counteroffensive against Russia, although the timing remains unclear. In recent days, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has suggested the counteroffensive would be delayed because Ukraine still needed more weapons from its Western partners, while also saying \u201cthe first important steps will be taken soon.\u201d\n\n>U.S. officials expect fighting to continue even after the counteroffensive.\n\n>In the medium-term, many expect a stalemate, during which fighting continues but neither side gains much ground, or a war of attrition, which involves both sides trying to wreak massive losses of personnel and equipment on the other in the hopes the adversary will collapse.\n\n>How Ukraine and Russia perform depends on sometimes uncontrollable factors ranging from air superiority to who\u2019s in charge at the Kremlin.\n\n>\u201cOnce you get past few months or a year, these wars tend to last years,\u201d said Benjamin Jensen of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who has analyzed the historical data. \u201cEven with the most wildly successful Ukraine counteroffensive, you could still be seeing yourself fighting this time next year.\u201d\n\n>None of the administration officials who spoke to POLITICO would offer specifics about how the U.S. would handle a years-long war or describe the exact depth of planning for a frozen conflict \u2014 information that\u2019s largely classified. One U.S. official stressed that the administration has always planned for both long-term and short-term possibilities.\n\n>The longer the fight drags on, the more likely Russia and Ukraine will feel international and domestic pressure to negotiate a ceasefire, an armistice or another legal mechanism to halt, if not officially end, the war.\n\n>Some U.S. officials and analysts say one rough model could be the Korean War. Active fighting in that conflict ended with an armistice in 1953, but, even 70 years later, the war has not been formally declared over.\n\n>\u201cA Korea-style stoppage is certainly something that\u2019s been discussed by experts and analysts in and out of government\u201d when it comes to Ukraine, the former Biden administration official said. \u201cIt\u2019s plausible, because neither side would need to recognize any new borders and the only thing that would have to be agreed is to stop shooting along a set line.\u201d (The negotiations for the Korea armistice lasted two years.)\n\n>Other potentially relevant examples include the 2008 dispute between Georgia and Russia over two provinces; the more than 70-year-old India-Pakistan face-off over the Kashmir region, a period that includes three wars separated by long cold stretches; and arguably even segments of the Russia-Ukraine conflict between 2014 and 2022, waged over parts of Ukraine\u2019s east and its Crimea region.\n\n>Such halted wars occasionally resume: A 1994 ceasefire between Azerbaijan and Armenia over the Nagorno-Karabakh region held \u2014 though not perfectly \u2014 until heavy fighting broke the peace in 2020. The two countries are now trying to negotiate.\n\n>Western involvement in each case also varies. The United States fought in the Korean War and still has thousands of troops in South Korea \u2014 a key difference with Ukraine, where American forces are not fighting. But Washington has had little role in other conflicts, such as Kashmir.\n\n>A former U.S. intelligence official who handled Russia-related matters said Biden aides appear to be more willing these days to discuss long-term security guarantees for Ukraine \u2014 another sign they are thinking well past the coming Ukrainian counteroffensive.\n\n>Ukraine wants to join NATO, and the military alliance\u2019s secretary-general has said its members agree that eventually it will.\n\n>The senior Biden administration official confirmed that U.S. officials are talking to the Ukrainians about the nature of the relationship in the future. \u201cWe want a Ukraine that can defend itself and deter future attacks,\u201d the official said, stressing that Washington will not pressure Ukraine to enter negotiations against its will.\n\n>If Ukraine\u2019s NATO membership bid stalls, such guarantees could range from a NATO-style Article 5 mutual defense deal to Israel-style arms deals with Ukraine as a deterrent against Russia.\n\n>At a minimum, some current and former U.S. officials say, Ukraine\u2019s military must get special attention. That could include making sure Ukraine\u2019s weapons and equipment are compatible with those of NATO countries and conducting joint training, even if Kyiv isn\u2019t in the military alliance.\n\n>Analysts and officials warned against assuming that a frozen conflict translates to geopolitical stability or less suffering among civilians caught in the disputed territories. The Korean peninsula and India-Pakistan are both now nuclear flashpoints as a result of decisions made by governments involved in the decades since the fights first began.\n\n>Yuriy Sak, an adviser to Ukraine\u2019s defense minister, said one reason Kyiv is constantly urging its Western partners to send more weapons and other aid is precisely because it wants to end the war quickly, not find itself in an endless face-off.",

It\u2019s also becoming increasingly likely amid the growing sense within the administration that an upcoming Ukrainian counteroffensive won\u2019t deal a mortal blow to Russia.</p>\n\n<p>A frozen conflict \u2014 in which fighting pauses but neither side is declared the victor nor do they agree that the war is officially over \u2014 also could be a politically palatable long-term result for the United States and other countries backing Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>It would mean the number of military clashes would fall, the costs of supporting Kyiv also likely would drop, and public attention to the war would wane.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe are planning for the long term, whether it looks frozen or thawed,\u201d said a U.S. official familiar with the Biden administration\u2019s discussions on Ukraine. The official said such planning is a growing focus of the administration, whereas in past months \u201cit was all about the urgent and short-term.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Two other U.S. officials and a former Biden administration official confirmed that an extended freeze in fighting is one possibility for which the U.S. is preparing. U.S. officials also are thinking through the long-term security ties Washington will have with Kyiv, as well as Ukraine\u2019s relationship with the NATO military alliance.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a school of thought that says, \u2018Oh, the Ukrainians have to have [the city of] Mariupol and Azov Sea access.\u2019 There\u2019s others less hung up about the placement of the lines as long as Ukraine is secure going into the future,\u201d the former administration official said, describing the internal conversations.</p>\n\n<p>Such discussions remain in early stages, with the U.S. officials stressing that the war will remain hot for quite some time and that the Biden administration is intent on providing Ukraine with the weapons and support it needs to push the Russians out of as much territory as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Still, even the suggestion of such planning could undermine Ukrainian leaders\u2019 confidence in America\u2019s continued commitment to their cause, especially given agitation among some Republicans to lessen support for Kyiv.</p>\n\n<p>A fifth person, a senior Biden administration official speaking on behalf of the White House, said an array of contingency plans are being weighed, but the situation is fluid and the only safe prediction is that Russia will not conquer Ukraine. Like others interviewed, the official was granted anonymity to describe sensitive issues.</p>\n\n<p>While many U.S. officials avoid publicly talking about how the Russia-Ukraine conflict will evolve, Joint Chiefs Chair Gen. Mark Milley has repeatedly predicted that it will end in negotiations, not a military victory for either side.</p>\n\n<p>And the makeup of recent military aid packages to Ukraine reflects the Biden administration\u2019s shift to a longer-term strategy, a Defense Department official said.</p>\n\n<p>The amount of equipment sent directly from existing U.S. stockpiles has steadily diminished over the past few months, while the packages of aid used to purchase new weapons from industry \u2014 a process that can take months to years \u2014 has increased.</p>\n\n<p>The Biden administration recently transferred $300 million worth of weapons from existing U.S. stockpiles, primarily ammunition, while providing $1.2 billion to purchase more complex weapons, such as air defenses, from industry.</p>\n\n<p>At the moment, Ukraine is preparing a counteroffensive against Russia, although the timing remains unclear. In recent days, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has suggested the counteroffensive would be delayed because Ukraine still needed more weapons from its Western partners, while also saying \u201cthe first important steps will be taken soon.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>U.S. officials expect fighting to continue even after the counteroffensive.</p>\n\n<p>In the medium-term, many expect a stalemate, during which fighting continues but neither side gains much ground, or a war of attrition, which involves both sides trying to wreak massive losses of personnel and equipment on the other in the hopes the adversary will collapse.</p>\n\n<p>How Ukraine and Russia perform depends on sometimes uncontrollable factors ranging from air superiority to who\u2019s in charge at the Kremlin.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOnce you get past few months or a year, these wars tend to last years,\u201d said Benjamin Jensen of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who has analyzed the historical data. \u201cEven with the most wildly successful Ukraine counteroffensive, you could still be seeing yourself fighting this time next year.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>None of the administration officials who spoke to POLITICO would offer specifics about how the U.S. would handle a years-long war or describe the exact depth of planning for a frozen conflict \u2014 information that\u2019s largely classified. One U.S. official stressed that the administration has always planned for both long-term and short-term possibilities.</p>\n\n<p>The longer the fight drags on, the more likely Russia and Ukraine will feel international and domestic pressure to negotiate a ceasefire, an armistice or another legal mechanism to halt, if not officially end, the war.</p>\n\n<p>Some U.S. officials and analysts say one rough model could be the Korean War. Active fighting in that conflict ended with an armistice in 1953, but, even 70 years later, the war has not been formally declared over.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cA Korea-style stoppage is certainly something that\u2019s been discussed by experts and analysts in and out of government\u201d when it comes to Ukraine, the former Biden administration official said. \u201cIt\u2019s plausible, because neither side would need to recognize any new borders and the only thing that would have to be agreed is to stop shooting along a set line.\u201d (The negotiations for the Korea armistice lasted two years.)</p>\n\n<p>Other potentially relevant examples include the 2008 dispute between Georgia and Russia over two provinces; the more than 70-year-old India-Pakistan face-off over the Kashmir region, a period that includes three wars separated by long cold stretches; and arguably even segments of the Russia-Ukraine conflict between 2014 and 2022, waged over parts of Ukraine\u2019s east and its Crimea region.</p>\n\n<p>Such halted wars occasionally resume: A 1994 ceasefire between Azerbaijan and Armenia over the Nagorno-Karabakh region held \u2014 though not perfectly \u2014 until heavy fighting broke the peace in 2020. The two countries are now trying to negotiate.</p>\n\n<p>Western involvement in each case also varies. The United States fought in the Korean War and still has thousands of troops in South Korea \u2014 a key difference with Ukraine, where American forces are not fighting. But Washington has had little role in other conflicts, such as Kashmir.</p>\n\n<p>A former U.S. intelligence official who handled Russia-related matters said Biden aides appear to be more willing these days to discuss long-term security guarantees for Ukraine \u2014 another sign they are thinking well past the coming Ukrainian counteroffensive.</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine wants to join NATO, and the military alliance\u2019s secretary-general has said its members agree that eventually it will.</p>\n\n<p>The senior Biden administration official confirmed that U.S. officials are talking to the Ukrainians about the nature of the relationship in the future. \u201cWe want a Ukraine that can defend itself and deter future attacks,\u201d the official said, stressing that Washington will not pressure Ukraine to enter negotiations against its will.</p>\n\n<p>If Ukraine\u2019s NATO membership bid stalls, such guarantees could range from a NATO-style Article 5 mutual defense deal to Israel-style arms deals with Ukraine as a deterrent against Russia.</p>\n\n<p>At a minimum, some current and former U.S. officials say, Ukraine\u2019s military must get special attention. That could include making sure Ukraine\u2019s weapons and equipment are compatible with those of NATO countries and conducting joint training, even if Kyiv isn\u2019t in the military alliance.</p>\n\n<p>Analysts and officials warned against assuming that a frozen conflict translates to geopolitical stability or less suffering among civilians caught in the disputed territories. The Korean peninsula and India-Pakistan are both now nuclear flashpoints as a result of decisions made by governments involved in the decades since the fights first began.</p>\n\n<p>Yuriy Sak, an adviser to Ukraine\u2019s defense minister, said one reason Kyiv is constantly urging its Western partners to send more weapons and other aid is precisely because it wants to end the war quickly, not find itself in an endless face-off.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

It used to be that comments sections were rather full with legitimate information, now they\u2019re filled with shit. It makes the community worse. It\u2019s not about moral grandstanding, rather keeping some resemblance of a community based around war monitoring and legitimate discussion regarding combat footage/active wars. </p>\n\n<p>The most pertinent example of lax moderation leading to the destruction of multiple subreddits comes from the GameStop saga two years ago. There are subreddits with hundreds of thousands, even millions of subscribers all dedicated to some conspiracy theory that they will be rich because a brick and mortar video game retailer got short sold by larger investment firms. This is obviously not going to happen, but when tens/hundreds of thousands come from defaults and start installing their groupthink, you\u2019ve fucked it. Subs like <a href=\"/r/combatfootage\">/r/combatfootage</a> need to maintain and grow their user base in a responsible manner. Once average Redditor gets involved you can kiss nuance and rational discussion goodbye.</p>\n</div>",

Thailand has followed a party list voting system since the 'democratisation' in the 1990s and continues to use the system, making it very hard to have a single party dominate elections and always ensuring a multi-party result. It's just that one man (Thaksin) has such widespread *rural* popularity that he sweeps up all the rural seats and dominates most elections that way. \n\nThe Ex-PM, General Prayuth Chan-Ocha, officially left the military along with his buddies Interior Minister Anupong Paochinda and Deputy PM Prawit Wongsuwon. The '[3P triumvirate](https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Is-Thailand-s-top-trio-of-ex-army-chiefs-marching-into-the-sunset)' famously had a falling out in 2021 where pro-democracy movements attempted to [censure the PM](https://www.thaipbsworld.com/censure-debate-signals-end-of-prayuts-command-and-control-leadership/) for his handling of the government (not COVID, unlike other countries, everyone seems to be okay with his COVID policies). The rumour is that Anupong, as Prayuth's 'senior' (he was the previous C-in-C of the Army before Prayuth), disliked having to serve under Prayuth's government. And Prawit was just a seedy guy who wants to throw his horse at whoever is winning.\n\nHowever, that the parliamentary debate was allowed at all signalled to everyone that the current military establishment has cut ties with their former C-in-C, so a coup to restore their power seems unlikely. It should also be noted that since the 90's, the military (or atleast, in the military's view) has launched coups on stabilising grounds. In the coup prior, in 2006, the Anupong's own predecessor ceded power back to a civilian government peacefully. Prayuth in 2014 wanted to restore order after more mass protests against Thaksin's sister, but got 'carried away'.\n\nThe whole 2023 election was an exercise of hubris. Prayuth surrounded himself with yes-men and failed to see how deeply unpopular he is, with his paternalistic style of governing (like [this incident where he just sprays sanitiser at the media because they were 'speaking bullshit'](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-asia-56342860) receiving widespread criticism as unbecoming of a PM. Thaksin failed to see how his supporters, after fighting for 16 years of peace, would get tired of his empty promises and especially get tired of him appointing his own daughter as a PM candidate after doing the same to his sister in 2010. So this progressive/liberal Move Forward party pulled a surprise victory and won the highest number of seats, but they still needed a coalition with Thaksin's Pheu Thai party to form a government. Beyond the party leader, Pita Limjaroenrat, becoming PM, the rest of the terms of the coalition are unclear, including whether there will be an amnesty for Thaksin.\n\nWhat *could* happen is if there is more political chaos if Thaksin is allowed to come back to Thailand. The military may view that they need to step in again, like they did in 2006 and 2014.",

The project is not yet finalised, however, the Russian Government has announced that nearly all parameters of the Power of Siberia 2 agreement have been agreed on (including with Mongolia), and that the Russian oil and gas company Gazprom has been instructed to ensure that a delivery contract for the pipeline is approved as soon as possible. The start of construction of the pipeline is expected to begin in 2024 with a planned completion in 2029. Despite these announcements, the agreement on the Power of Siberia 2 pipeline was not included in the final Russia-China communique.\n\n>In addition, Russia has announced that it expects to expand the supply of oil and LNG to China, and that it wil deliver at least 98 bcm of natural gas and 100 Mt of LNG to China by 2030. **Russia also declared that negotiations were ongoing to involve Chinese companies in the construction of a 13 Mt/year LNG complex in Ust-Luga, Leningrad Oblast (Russia).**\n\n>Russian gas exports to China have increased since the commissioning of the Power of Siberia 1 pipeline in 2019 (northern section) and 2020 (middle section). Gas supply from the Power of Siberia 1 pipeline reached **10.4 bcm in 2021 and 15 bcm in 2022. For 2023, volumes are expected to reach 22 bcm.** One more section of the Power of Siberia 1 pipeline (Western route) is currently under construction, which will bring the pipeline\u2019s capacity **to 38 bcm/year.** Another 10 bcm/year project, Power of Siberia 3 (Far Eastern route), is also currently under development.\n\nAnd to be clear, I'm not cheerleading for russia here, just trying to inject some realism.

The project is not yet finalised, however, the Russian Government has announced that nearly all parameters of the Power of Siberia 2 agreement have been agreed on (including with Mongolia), and that the Russian oil and gas company Gazprom has been instructed to ensure that a delivery contract for the pipeline is approved as soon as possible. The start of construction of the pipeline is expected to begin in 2024 with a planned completion in 2029. Despite these announcements, the agreement on the Power of Siberia 2 pipeline was not included in the final Russia-China communique.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, Russia has announced that it expects to expand the supply of oil and LNG to China, and that it wil deliver at least 98 bcm of natural gas and 100 Mt of LNG to China by 2030. <strong>Russia also declared that negotiations were ongoing to involve Chinese companies in the construction of a 13 Mt/year LNG complex in Ust-Luga, Leningrad Oblast (Russia).</strong></p>\n\n<p>Russian gas exports to China have increased since the commissioning of the Power of Siberia 1 pipeline in 2019 (northern section) and 2020 (middle section). Gas supply from the Power of Siberia 1 pipeline reached <strong>10.4 bcm in 2021 and 15 bcm in 2022. For 2023, volumes are expected to reach 22 bcm.</strong> One more section of the Power of Siberia 1 pipeline (Western route) is currently under construction, which will bring the pipeline\u2019s capacity <strong>to 38 bcm/year.</strong> Another 10 bcm/year project, Power of Siberia 3 (Far Eastern route), is also currently under development.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And to be clear, I&#39;m not cheerleading for russia here, just trying to inject some realism. They knew the sanctions were coming, they prepared for it and it shows.</p>\n</div>",

Maybe a couple decades after Putin is dead I guess. And Russia will be too busy exporting nuclear reactors and fuel to worry about wind and solar:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akkuyu_Nuclear_Power_Plant\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akkuyu_Nuclear_Power_Plant</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>But it&#39;s not gonna be enough to make Russia a super power.

And let&#39;s be honest, even when it was part of the soviet union it was barely a super power. </p></li>\n<li><p>China is already investing in Russian oil and gas, so they got that covered.</p></li>\n</ol>\n</div>",

Ukrainian attacks were extremely effective during that offensive because Russian manpower was depleted to such an extent that they were forced to man their lines with riot police, national guardsmen, and badly mauled units. \n\nRight now, we're seeing Ukraine launch highly effective attacks on the flanks of Bakhmut that have taken more territory in days than Russians achieved in months. These attacks are being launched not by Ukraine's strategic or operational reserve either, but just forces that were already on hand. Part of the reason these attacks have been so successful is because Russian forces on the flanks of Bakhmut are manned by mobiks and badly mauled units in insufficient numbers. There's been quite a lot of anecdotal evidence that the forces on the flanks of Bakhmut have extremely low morale too, with videos of several Russian suicides and troops dropping their weapons and fleeing in disarray. \n\nOne would think Russia would be better defending the flanks of Bakhmut considering its their only major success in their Winter offensive, and outside of Avdiivka the only site of major fighting at the moment. I really only see two reasons why this would be happening. \n\nFirst, infighting between the MOD and Wagner has caused Russian command to purposefully weaken the flanks around Bakhmut to screw with Wagner, which I think is pretty unlikely. \n\nFar more likely in my opinion is that Russian forces are absolutely exhausted and after a huge surge in manpower following mobilization, they're lacking sufficient forces to man their long lines. If Russia is improperly defending the flanks of Bakhmut, what does that say about their defenses elsewhere in Ukraine? While Russia's defensive works are somewhat impressive in say, Zaporizhzhia, they don't amount to much if Russia is unable to properly man those lines because they lack sufficient manpower. As Kofman has said repeatedly, if Russia doesn't implement another round of mobilization and soon, they could be in real trouble.\n\nEdit: I feel like people are reading the first sentence before responding, and not really grasping the point of my post. I'm not saying the fighting around Bakhmut is reminiscent of Kharkiv, I'm just pointing out that the Kharkiv offensive was enabled by low Russian manpower and morale, and it appears that Russian forces are again low on manpower and morale in advance of this upcoming Ukrainian offensive.

So let's use your examples.\n\n>I am tired of being yelled at by my kids, but I don't quite being a parent.\n\nIf you're tired of being yelled at by your kids, but you aren't tired of being a parent, then what do you do? Do you turn your kids over to the nearest adoption agency? No. Do you sit there while they yell at you? Also hopefully no. Instead you try to get rid of the things you are tired of, while keeping the things you value. So, for example, maybe you try a new parenting technique. Maybe you and/or your kid go to therapy. Maybe you change your behavior so the thing that your kid is yelling about won't happen again. Maybe something else.\n\n>I am tired of my body hurting but I don't give up on life because I am getting older.\n\nSo on the one hand you presumably don't commit suicide. But also you hopefully don't just deal with an aching body. Maybe you take some medicine. Maybe you try some new exercises or stretches.\n\n>I am tired of my team loosing but I don't give up on coaching them because how else do they improve.\n\nSo hopefully you don't quit coaching. But on the other hand your team is losing, so doing nothing isn't great. Maybe you try to recruit better players. Maybe you practice more. Maybe you try new techniques in practice?\n\nAs you can see, generally speaking, when you are tired of one thing but not tired of another, related thing, you generally try to end the thing you are tired of while preserving the thing you are not tired of.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the situation in Ukraine. As I said, Poland is tired of the war, but not tired of supporting Ukraine. So do they just abandon Ukraine? No, they want to support Ukraine. Do they try to support Ukraine in a way that perpetuates the war? No, they want the war to end. So instead they, alongside the heavyweight, the US, are instead trying to give Ukraine enough assistance to win the war, because a Ukrainian victory both supports Ukraine and ends the war. (And ends it in a more permanent fashion that is less likely to lead to similar problems in the future.)\n\nNow, to go back to the issue that started this whole discussion, what happens if Russia loses all their captured territory, and keeps fighting anyway? Well, Poland (and everyone else) are happy because they have supported Ukraine, but unhappy because they still have this destabilizing war going on. So what are they going to do? Stop supporting Ukraine? Unlikely, and at that point probably not even effective in terms of ending the war. Just live with this destabilizing war indefinitely? No, they want the war to end. Probably they will escalate further, by supporting Ukraine capturing Russian territory, or launching their own missile campaign against Russia, or something similar, until they cause enough damage to Russia to force Russia to give up.",

While tangentially related, this is a bit of a departure from the law of war.\n\nNo, liable for military targeting, as shown by the second document. NATO forces specifically used the Rwandan precedent to exclude some Yugoslav stations because the dual use guideline was insufficient: technically they would have all qualified for dual use, as they had all been placed under government control. However, they considered that some of them were not engaging in a type of propaganda that would have made them legitimate military targets -- or, to put it another way, some types of journalistic action do qualify the institutions and individuals who engage in them as legitimate military target, and a review panel actually had to check it.\n\nOutside official documents per se, which only offer precedent, not policy, there are legal authors who explicitly confirm this position. Ted Richard, for instance, in his Unofficial United States Guide to the First Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions, mentions this case, and argues that \"if the media is used to incite crimes, as in Rwanda, then it is a legitimate target. If it is merely disseminating propaganda to generate support for the war effort, it is not a legitimate target.\u201d\n\nI am not arguing that any of this applies in some specific case, like Dugina's or whatever. I'm arguing against your original point, that civilian propagandists are afforded unconditional protection because they are civilians. They're not -- civilian protection is not unconditional in the first place (it's only afforded as long as they are not taking direct part in hostilities), and is not extended to journalists in some cases.",
                                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For instance, the Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Libre des Mille Collines was considered to be directly involved in the Rwandan genocide, and protection was not afforded to either the journalists or the institution itself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sure, liable in an international court for the genocide perpetrated, not for advocating for a war. While tangentially related, this is a bit of a departure from the law of war.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>No, liable for military targeting, as shown by the second document. NATO forces specifically used the Rwandan precedent to exclude some Yugoslav stations because the dual use guideline was insufficient: technically they would have all qualified for dual use, as they had all been placed under government control. However, they considered that some of them were not engaging in a type of propaganda that would have made them legitimate military targets -- or, to put it another way, some types of journalistic action do qualify the institutions and individuals who engage in them as legitimate military target, and a review panel actually had to check it.</p>\n\n<p>Outside official documents per se, which only offer precedent, not policy, there are legal authors who explicitly confirm this position. Ted Richard, for instance, in his Unofficial United States Guide to the First Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions, mentions this case, and argues that &quot;if the media is used to incite crimes, as in Rwanda, then it is a legitimate target. If it is merely disseminating propaganda to generate support for the war effort, it is not a legitimate target.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I am not arguing that any of this applies in some specific case, like Dugina&#39;s or whatever. I&#39;m arguing against your original point, that civilian propagandists are afforded unconditional protection because they are civilians. They&#39;re not -- civilian protection is not unconditional in the first place (it&#39;s only afforded as long as they are not taking direct part in hostilities), and is not extended to journalists in some cases.</p>\n</div>",

It's not about what protection is afforded to journalists, it's about the US' interpretation of what constitutes civilian activity. Specifically this part: \"In some cases, the United States and other States have not accepted the ICRC\u2019s proposals or interpretations and instead expressed opposing views. For example, the United States has not accepted the ICRC\u2019s study on customary international humanitarian law *nor its interpretive guidance on direct participation in hostilities*\" (emphasis mine).\n\nThe ICRC's interpretive guidance to international humanitarian law is itself fairly broad as to what constitutes \"direct participation in hostilities \" from a civilian, at which point they would no longer be afforded protection as a civilian, and acknowledges that international humanitarian law is somewhat ambiguous. But either way, the US, not just as a matter of de facto interpretation, but as a matter of policy, does not accept the ICRC's interpretive guidance, and uses its own criteria (inb4 see I told you US evil: pretty much all countries that ever went to war after the Second World War have their own policies in this regard).\n\nHow is this relevant to journalists: the legal basis for affording protection to journalists in general is their status, either as civilians, or as persons authorized to accompany the armed forces (in which case they're issued special IDs so they are entitled to POW status if they are captured). This is indeed covered in 4.24: \"In general, journalists are protected as civilians; i.e., engaging in journalism does not constitute taking a direct part in hostilities such that such a person would be deprived of protection from being made the object of attack.\" However, the manual does go on to note that \"Although journalism is regarded as a civilian activity, the fact that a person performs such work does not preclude that person from otherwise acquiring a different status under the law of war, such as the status of persons authorized to accompany the armed forces or of combatants.\" As an example noted later (4.24.1.2), \"although engaging in journalism would not be a basis to consider a person an unprivileged belligerent, an unprivileged belligerent would not be precluded from being considered as such because he or she works as a journalist.\"\n\nJournalists aren't afforded separate protection specific to their quality as journalists per se. The manual notes that \"[they] do not form a distinct class of persons under the law of war, but instead receive protection through the general protections afforded civilians. Thus, in general, the rights, duties, and liabilities applicable to civilians also apply to journalists.\"\n\nIn short, then: journalists are offered protection only insofar as their activity is compatible with a) civilian status or b) war correspondence (i.e. \"persons authorized to accompany the armed forces\") -- that is, they are granted protection because they fall under either a) or b), not because they are journalists, which is not recognized as a distinct class of persons. A journalist who, as part of what they or their media institution/government/whatever consider journalistic work, performs activities that are not compatible with their civilian status, is not precluded from losing civilian status on account of being a journalist. \n\nThat's why I said \"civilian propagandists are still civilian\" is not at all as clear-cut as it sounds. Even accepting the broadest technical definition of civilian activity, i.e. the one stated by the IHL, equating \"being a journalist\" with \"being a civilian\" is incorrect per se, as civilian status is afforded based on activity, not profession. Furthermore, the IHL is inherently very broad. There's a variety of interpretation frameworks out there (I mentioned the US' just because I'm slightly more familiar with it via the Yugoslav Wars) and, under some of them, some instances of propaganda really are incompatible with civilian status, so in fact *some* civilian journalists are not seen as entitled to civilian protection on account of it.",

It&#39;s better to be executed by Russia for refusing to fight than to kill a single Ukrainian soldier, in the same way that it&#39;s better to be murdered than to murder. </p>\n\n<p>This man is the model I aspire to for this:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_J%C3%A4gerst%C3%A4tter\">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_J\u00e4gerst\u00e4tter</a></p>\n</div>",
