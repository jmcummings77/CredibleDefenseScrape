The people of the Chin State are locked in a deadly conflict with Myanmar\u2019s ruthless military machine \u2013 the Tatmadaw. \n\nCrossing into Myanmar from northeast India, reporter Matt Davis has gained exclusive access to the Chin resistance.\n\nAs he travels across rivers and on mountain passes, he meets the people who\u2019ve given up everything to fight Myanmar\u2019s military junta.\n\nLiving in jungle camps and makeshift villages, students and farmers, doctors and engineers are organising into civilian defence units to defeat the Tatmadaw. The region has seen some of the heaviest fighting yet in the 18-month-long civil war.\n\nDavis spends time with 28-year-old Cung, an agricultural worker who joined the Chin Defence Forces 18 months ago. He\u2019s now the Commander in Chief of his battalion. Armed with little more than single-shot rifles and homemade explosives, he and his young fighters have transformed into a fearsome guerilla force.\n\n\"This is our land, this is our place,\" he says. \"They can't defeat us, the only thing they can do is burn our homes, our churches. We hunt them like wolves.\"\n\nDavis travels close to the centre of the current conflict, the strategic hillside town of Thantlang, recently taken by the Tatmadaw. Its 12000 residents have fled.\n\nIn a hilltop hospital, not far from Thantlang, a young Chin doctor, Dr Amos, and his wife Rebecca, a nurse, struggle to care for the wounded.\n\n\"The hardest bit has been getting medicines and operating equipment,\" says Dr Amos. \n\nNearby, Davis meets 16-year-old Emily. Before Thantlang was taken, she was a high school student. Now she\u2019s a refugee in her own country, her life on pause.\n\nShe hasn't seen her school friends in months. \"I miss them so much,\" she says. \"I am alone.\"\n\nThe Chin people are begging for the international community to help them. \n\nThey want tough sanctions imposed against the Tatmadaw and weapons supplies.\n\nBut with the war in Ukraine occupying the headlines, Myanmar\u2019s bitter civil war has been overlooked.\n\nDr Sui Khar, a leader of the China National Front, says the Chin will not give up.\n\n\"Under this military dictatorship \u2026 the youth have already convinced themselves that their future is nothing,\" he says. \"That's why this is the once and for all war, to eliminate this military dictatorship.\"\n\nThis powerful film shines a light on a forgotten conflict\n\nRead more here: https://ab.co/3PwDBHo\n\n-----------------\n\nAbout Foreign Correspondent: \n\nForeign Correspondent is the prime-time international public affairs program on Australia's national broadcaster, ABC-TV.

Thus by the enemy reaches the MLR, they\u2019re exhausted and spent. Or more specifically they never reach the MLR, because post-WWII Soviet doctrine emphasized movement.

First in many places along the old JFO, the prewar defenses focused on a static forward defense. It was about holding a maximal amount of territory, not constructing positions designed to withstand 15k shells/day. Second the JFO was always a very close position. There simply wasn\u2019t room to build a line to a depth of 15-20km. Thus the MLR is far forward with little room for a forward battle. Third, Ukraine has made a political choice (and imo the correct one) that no amount of territory is worth losing. So rather than withdraw from JFO into better positions, they hold on tooth and nail to what they have, even if parts of it are vulnerable. Fourth, Ukraine has not demonstrated the ability to launch major counterattacks into the Donbas region, so any territory lost in the Donbas is potentially gone for good, meaning you need enough troops up front to stop not just a recon in force but a major battalion sized assault as we saw in previous months.",

The USN has had SAMs since RIM-2 Terrier entered service in 1956. \n\nThe US isn't hinting at anything, HELIOS is a publicly announced prototype from 2019. It's designed as a close in weapons system(CIWS) to augment or replace the Phalanx and possibly the RAM. It doesn't \"shoot down\" missiles per se, it's a dazzler as implied by the name \"High Energy Laser and Integrated Optical-dazzler with Surveillance system\". As per the article it's designed for drones and fast attack boats.

It&#39;s designed as a close in weapons system(CIWS) to augment or replace the Phalanx and possibly the RAM.

If I were young I'd go, but I'm too old now,\" he tells me, clenching his fists. \"We should bomb them!\"\n\n> But most people in the town seem less enthusiastic. \"[The war] is too painful to even talk about,\" one woman complains. \"Killing your brothers is wrong.\" I ask her what she would say if one of her relatives wanted to join. \"Why go?

The Kremlin still hopes that quantity can win over quality. That they can get these hundreds of thousands of desperate people with their debts and just throw them into the conflict zone.\"\n\n> Despite the eyewatering amounts of cash on offer to potential recruits - up to \u00a34,700 ($5,700) a month in some cases - Roman says the reality is different.\n\n> **\"People don't actually see this money,\"** he says. \"They are returning [from Ukraine] now and telling us journalists about how they were deceived. This is also influencing the situation, this lack of trust in our government, so I don't think this strategy will be successful.\"\n\n> But some are happy to join up.\n\n> Nina Chubarina's son Yevgeny left their village in the northern region of Karelia to join a volunteer battalion. Nina says her son, who had no military experience, was given a gun and sent straight into Ukraine.\n\n> He was killed just days later. He was 24 years old.\n\n> Nina agrees to meet me in a park near Moscow, where she has found part-time work in a bread factory. She says the monotonous task of packing loaves takes her mind off the loss of her son.\n\n> She remembers pleading with her son not to go to Ukraine.\n\n> \"I tried to talk him out of it. I cried. I said, 'There's a war, you'll be killed!' He said, 'Mum, everything will be fine.'\"\n\n> Nina is critical of how the authorities recruit volunteers to fight in Ukraine.\n\n> \"They just send them in like dumb little chickens! They'd hardly even held a gun before. They're cannon fodder. The generals think, 'We've got a volunteer: great, in you go!'\"\n\n> Not everyone is as keen to sign up as Yevgeny.\n\n> Travelling around this country, you are not left with the impression that the Russian people are all fully behind the \"special military operation,\" as the Kremlin likes to call it.\n\n> **The number of cars on Russian roads displaying the pro-war \"Z\" symbol is still relatively few. Experts say that the numbers of volunteers joining up are low.**\n\n> Military analyst Pavel Luzin says people here are not ready to sacrifice themselves for their president.\n\n> \"The problem for the Kremlin is that most Russian people are not going to die for Putin or for the restoration of 'the great Empire'.

The idea being that it is rare in natural images to have much duplication in them. The implication is that parts of the image were duplicated as part of the editing process. It's a common photoshop operation. In this case, the implication would be that the ID borders were 'cleaned up'. I'm not sure how compelling this one is, in particular.\n\n2. Unnatural blurring in the image which would imply usage of a Gaussian blur tool in photoshop.\n\n3. Editing a JPEG and then saving the edited JPEG again will show the edits with differing encoding noise. I believe this is because of the JPEG compression stacking.\n\n4. Unnaturally straight lines. Natural objects in photos hardly ever have ruler straight edges. The implication is that the photo was amateurishly cut out of somewhere else and pasted in this image.\n\n5. I'm not sure. I think it's showing evidence of how the editor used the magic wand tool in Photoshop to auto select a region to edit in the photo during the modifications.

For example, Britain fought two wars against China that we would *most certainly* define as \"imperial conquests\" that would not match your narrow definition.\n\n>you can \u201cconquer\u201d nations via economic power only\n\nYes.

A brief look at history shows this is ridiculous. What might we call Neo-Assyrian empire's conquest and establishment of vassal states, if not conquest?

(I don't understand your point about failure, are we saying that if you *fail* to conquest something it's no longer a conquest?). The distinction seems rather academic to me - particularly for *the people who live there.* It does not particularly matter to the Iraqi whose house is bombed that \"oh don't worry, we're not here as conquerers\" (where have I heard that line before?).\n\n>maybe nations don\u2019t hold grudges\n\nHistory informs political outlook which shapes geopolitics as much as realpolitik.",

We reached the hreatest height of prosperity, freedom, health, development that we had in human history, but that does not matter.\n\nRussia ans China is not allowed to organisation because the West wants to conquer them, but becauae they are dictatorships, plain and simple. Ofc it is their internal thing and we wont meddle wirh it, but when they are reaching out against all international laws there is, we should just let them.

Nany millions of people, who would scream for help would be ignored by you, cause of conscious or unconscious lies that you make because you dont like the west.\n\nWhat we could most likely name as colonial keddlinf today are the France forces in the Sahel, where they fight extremista that are raping and teading eith children, use child labor, slave labor and wants to see the democratic order crushes an all who are not agreeing with them subjogated....\n\nFrance is helping this region because of monatary reasons mostly (colonies got free with significant economical chains and because of this France is against these states collapsing, they want them to prosper so they can get more out of them, yes). Welcome to the real world.\n\nThis will change by deus ex machina. OOOR maybe by 100 of years of cultural unity, peace and development. When we get better then we are right now.

Not to my knowledge. Kosovo is very much still an occupied country.\n\nAlas there are a lot of conflicting moral arguments and positions available, so it's not as simple as saying either both are right or both are wrong. However the point remains. Is it ok to invade another country and split it in 2, so long as you can provide a moral justification? Because evidence suggests that if someone else does it then it's morally reprehensible.\n\n> so did nato / eu maybe conquer yugoslavia?\n\nI've unironically heard people argue that the EU annexes states. Those people are a bit silly though\n\n> i\u2019m not being dishonest, i\u2019m just finding your position a bit too\u2026 natophobic? westphobic? to just leave it here unopposed.\n\nI hate the warmongering double standards. That basically sums up my entire position. The rhetoric is painfully dishonest. And dishonest rhetoric has severe consequences.\n\n'other people should suffer consequences that we would never impose on ourselves'. 'How dare other countries do exactly what we do and then proudly boast about when we do it' etc etc\n\nThe game is rigged. WE ARE the game. We just pretend it isn't, and that we're just playing along. The developing world are basically NPCs who have no say in anything and just pass the time hoping that everyone leaves them alone.\n\nRather than all the hypocritical bollocks about 'grr imperialists', why can't people just say 'i don't want russia to invade ukraine and i don't care what we have to do to stop them'. That is an honest, reasonable position. You don't need to dress it up in faux principled arguments about sovereignty or international law that you don't actually believe in.\n\nThe collective west has no credible basis to condemn wars of aggression. That counts just as much for the likes of the US/UK who have engaged in them as it does for the likes of Iceland who don't even have a military, but happily ally themselves with and support those states. None of us are innocent except those who hold a true neutral stance.\n\nThere is no moral authority.",

We just had a brief hiatus whilst we killed a load of spooky scary muslims and forgot about all the cold war nonsense. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>what about other parts of yugoslavia? was slovenia a war of conquest? croatia? those countries are in nato AND eu, </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Did we militarily occupy them (permanently it seems) and literally create the new state in our image? Not to my knowledge. Kosovo is very much still an occupied country.</p>\n\n<p>Alas there are a lot of conflicting moral arguments and positions available, so it&#39;s not as simple as saying either both are right or both are wrong. However the point remains. Is it ok to invade another country and split it in 2, so long as you can provide a moral justification? Because evidence suggests that if someone else does it then it&#39;s morally reprehensible.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>so did nato / eu maybe conquer yugoslavia?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve unironically heard people argue that the EU annexes states. Those people are a bit silly though</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>i\u2019m not being dishonest, i\u2019m just finding your position a bit too\u2026 natophobic? westphobic? to just leave it here unopposed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I hate the warmongering double standards. That basically sums up my entire position. The rhetoric is painfully dishonest. And dishonest rhetoric has severe consequences.</p>\n\n<p>&#39;other people should suffer consequences that we would never impose on ourselves&#39;. &#39;How dare other countries do exactly what we do and then proudly boast about when we do it&#39; etc etc</p>\n\n<p>The game is rigged. WE ARE the game. We just pretend it isn&#39;t, and that we&#39;re just playing along. The developing world are basically NPCs who have no say in anything and just pass the time hoping that everyone leaves them alone.</p>\n\n<p>Rather than all the hypocritical bollocks about &#39;grr imperialists&#39;, why can&#39;t people just say &#39;i don&#39;t want russia to invade ukraine and i don&#39;t care what we have to do to stop them&#39;. That is an honest, reasonable position. You don&#39;t need to dress it up in faux principled arguments about sovereignty or international law that you don&#39;t actually believe in.</p>\n\n<p>The collective west has no credible basis to condemn wars of aggression. That counts just as much for the likes of the US/UK who have engaged in them as it does for the likes of Iceland who don&#39;t even have a military, but happily ally themselves with and support those states. None of us are innocent except those who hold a true neutral stance.</p>\n\n<p>There is no moral authority.</p>\n</div>",

That you change them and then &#39;release them&#39; does not stop you having conquered them.</p>\n</div>",

            "body": "Procurement is one of the most difficult things the military does, because it\u2019s preparing today to win tomorrow. Except you don\u2019t know what tomorrows battle will look like or even, in some cases, the technology that you want to fight it with. Your division of \u2018technology=contractor, tactics=military\u2019 is also artificial. Most program managers have had experience in the type of platform they\u2019re seeking, they also need (and do) to keep abreast of major technological developments. Meanwhile the contractor must understand their clients needs, fully, to design and sell their product. This includes understanding doctrine, which is tactics at the theoretical level. When it works well, both sides play off each other to make a better platform. When it works poorly, well, it doesn\u2019t work so well. \n\nGenerally the USAF does competitive procurement for *most* of their platforms. At its best, competitive procurement allows the best platform to win out and offer the lowest cost. The USAF will typically announce competitive bidding for its next platform. Many companies, who understand the potential for big profits, will submit bids. Bids will be structured around a set of USAF requirements, so the project will first work up a shopping list. \u2018We want a plane capable of going X knots, a ceiling of Y ft, Z mi range, with A payload.\u2019 Stuff like that, but typically *very* specific. Then the bidder tries to submit a design that they think nails these requirements. Through a selection process, the USAF will move from paper bids, to computer simulations, model mockups, all the way to full sized & featured testers. Typically only 2 or 3 designs at most make it to the full sized testing phase. And as things get more serious, the USAF begins to toss its own money behind these projects. Once a full sized prototype is built, it can be evaluated based on its worthiness and the best (theoretically) is selected and enters a final design phase before mass production. \n\nIt\u2019s important to also remember that these projects also don\u2019t exist in isolation. One program may settle on an airframe. But another may be doing radars, and that\u2019s a different issue. And the USAF may stipulate that the prototype airframe be built to accommodate the unfinished radar. Or an air-to-air missile that hasn\u2019t even entered the bidding process (not USAF, but this issue is exactly what happened to the Zumwalt. Hulls we\u2019re laid down before guns ever left the design phase. Surprise, the guns didn\u2019t work as intended.) So we\u2019re adding on many layers of complexity. And this is with everything working as intended and everyone working as a good-faith actor. \n\nUnfortunately that\u2019s not always the case. First, in terms of req setting the military is often\u2026. Unreasonable. They have their own problems of course, Congress needs to approve of the multi-billon dollar acquisitions project and is often skeptical of the value of moderate proposals. Congress likes big and flashy, so the services deliver big and flashy, and emphasize \u2018game changing capabilities\u2019. But it\u2019s not always possible for the contractor to hit those requirements during the design phase, especially as \u2018game changing\u2019 program is layered on top of \u2018game changing program\u2019. Of course contractors are not always good faith actors themselves. In the American system, weapons manufacturers are private businesses like any other.  They aim to deliver the least amount possible for the highest cost, a goal totally at odds with what the military wants. To bridge this gap, contractors are willing to do all sorts of nefarious shit. Bribes, kick backs, cushy post-retirement jobs, any amount of graft. If that doesn\u2019t work, they can always overpromise and underdeliver. Remember when I said Congress liked flashy? Well what if the Contractor says \u2018we\u2019ll give you 110%, but you have to let us skip the bidding entirely.\u2019 Sounds great. But then they deliver 85% and charge 120%. Yet now it\u2019s too late, the contractor ducked the service and pissed off Congress and now the choice is 85% of something or 100% of nothing. For example, the Littoral Combat Ship which is at least *something*. And then of course Congress has its own provincial interests. Most don\u2019t think about it like this, but the M-I complex is *the* biggest make work program in America. Millions are employed either directly in M-I work, or indirectly by a company that *also* does M-I work. Contracts keep Boeing up and running when it\u2019s civilian products are anything but. The LCS employs thousands of steelworkers in a depressed community. Contractors can leverage these connections with Congress to make sure their design is picked. \n\nThe whole thing is overly complicated and rife with corruption and extra-military  considerations. Surely something better could be done. But currently nobody in the system wants it to change. So it doesn\u2019t. And what\u2019s true of the USAF is true to varying extents in all the services.",
