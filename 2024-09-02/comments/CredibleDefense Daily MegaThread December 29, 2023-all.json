As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

Maybe they are hoping to hit actual jets, test capabilities or simply are throwing a temper tantrum.\n\nI doubt it's related to the F-16 deliveries, this is going to be a little long so if you're not interested in knowing more context about the F16 donations then feel free to ignore it... There's been a lot of talk recently and press have run to the bank with the story as per usual, but by my estimation it's likely going to be a while while yet until the F16's are in Ukraine.   \n\n\nUkraine is expecting to receive F16's from two countries, The Netherlands and Denmark. Both are transferring a similar number of airframes over the course of the next year. (Denmark are transferring 19 and The Netherlands an optimistic 42, ***but it's likely only 18*** or so of that number will be flight worthy).   \n\n\nPeople and press keep referencing Belgium but they've already stated they will only consider transferring F16's in 2025 once they have had their (currently delayed) F35 deliveries to stand down their remaining F16 squadrons. Norway is also referenced frequently but many of their F16's have already been sold and the remainder has been referenced only as parts donors and worthy as museum exhibits (it's likely their remaining unsold airframes will be the worst pick of the litter (ergo not flight capable) after exports have picked through their fleet).   \n\n\nThe Netherlands are transferring their **18 flight ready F-16s to Ukrainian ownership in the coming months**, with the intention to transfer as many of the remaining 24 *likely non flight ready* F-16's as they can make operational. (Their trade minister made a comment of transferring anything that can still fly, so that should give you an idea of what sort of shape these aircraft are in).   \n\n\nThing is 5 of their F-16's are already stationed at the Romanian EFTC base and have been there for more than a month now, it's likely that the additional 13 flight worthy aircraft will be shunted to Romania and \"transferred\" to Ukraine, ergo Ukrainian crews take over shadowed maintenance and technical ownership of the airframe, using this opportunity to get used to handling the aircraft and continue building up pilot skills until they are combat ready.   \n\n\nThe Netherlands have a commitment to Romania as well as Ukraine in this case, they're not going to pull airframes from the EFTC program in the middle of Romanian pilot training, part of this whole multi-nation agreement for F16 transfers is reliant on this component so for all intents and purposes many of the Dutch F16's are likely going to be transferred to Ukrainian hands and *\\*operated in\\* Romania* for pilot training. This will just be a stopgap measure whilst Romania builds up its own fleet of transferred ex-Norwegian F16's, but there will be some lead time before the F16's can safely be used in Ukraine without impacting pilot training.   \n\n\nThis probably works out for the Ukrainians relatively well anyway, the Dutch F16's are by far the most weary of the bunch and have seen an incredible lifespan, well beyond what could be expected for airframes of their age. They've been struggling to keep them flight worthy and available for QRA duties, at one point last year they only had 4 flight worthy airframes of 42... So they're probably best used for relatively light pilot training instead of combat service in Ukraine.   \n\n\nDenmark is arguably the nation to look out for here. They're transferring **19 F16's** staggered over the next year or so with a set delivery schedule (likely tied to their Ukrainian pilot training program). The Danish F16's are generally considered the ones in the best shape which isn't saying much with a near 40 year old airframe. The Norwegian F16's have probably seen slightly less flight hours overall, but many of them have already technically been sold, a large chunk to Romania (as part of this EFTC agreement) and the remainder are *likely not going to Ukraine*, their was a pretty awkward comment recently about the remaining 9 or so F16's that Ukraine might receive being better used as parts donors and sent to Museums instead, so don't expect any F16's delivered from Norway.   \n\n\nThe Danish F16's are probably going to be the first F16's to enter Ukrainian hands in theatre and the first **6 F16's** are scheduled for full transfer to Ukrainian ownership in **March/April of this year**. That is when I'd expect to see Ukraine start using (however limited) their first F16's in theatre.   \n\n\nDenmark has been the most persistent of the Nordic countries in terms of pushing for F16 transfers and has had an active pilot training program for Ukrainian pilots since around August of this year. They've had pilots and maintenance crews shadowing and learning the ropes in preparation for the F16. To be clear this does not mean they've been actively working on the F16 the entire time up until this point. The bulk of this time has been spent focusing on English proficiency and small jet/prop trainers to get the pilots ready. It's worth remembering this in the context of Ukrainian F16 availability, the jets are waiting for them and will be transferred to Ukrainian ownership when they're ready to begin combat operations inside Ukraine.   \nThese F16 transfers have been in the works behind closed doors for a while now, I highly doubt there are going to be any actions taken, militarily speaking in terms of retaliation like you referenced, for Jets that aren't even in theatre yet and are likely to only be transferred to Ukrainian ownership come March/April of the next year.",

Zelensky throughout the course of the war has definitely taken a \u201cnot 1 step back\u201d approach, and while this strategy did pay off in the early days of the war in the Kiev convoy and tying Russia up in Mariupol, once severodontesk and bakhmut happened, it is now taking a toll on Ukraine\u2019s military.

It's approximately $21 billion in weapons, about $11 billion as a cash injection into the Ukrainian gov, and the remaining $25 billion covers the US's overhead costs related to the war. These expenses include various items like additional troops in Europe, refugee aid, etc. It's similar with the aid package for Israel, where a significant percentage of that package was allocated to cover the costs of an aircraft carrier group parked near Israel.\n\n2.
