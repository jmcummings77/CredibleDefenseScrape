As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster. Don't abuse it though! If something is not obviously against the rules but you still feel that it should be reviewed, leave a short but descriptive comment while filing the report.",

But it makes more sense than an actual DoD official being this careless - security clearance holder typically take it very seriously (duh).</p>\n\n<p>Either way, I&#39;m curious just how classified information is distributed to congressmen. Do they and their aides have to obtain security clearances, or do they basically get to request anything they want?</p>\n</div>",

The AFU is organizing  14 (or 15) new brigades but three weren\u2019t announced until mid march- April and wouldn\u2019t appear on this chart and the 82nd AAB isn\u2019t part of the ground forces.  There are some ambiguities -  The 37th Brigade doesn\u2019t appear on the org charts I have, but they certainly appear to be well along with formation and training; and I list a total of 7 brigades Ukraine is forming directly.  With the 3 April brigades and the Ukraine commitment subtracted, we have an overage of 1  on the Ukrainian side as well.  The most likely 3 Ukraine has committed to are the 88th OMB, the 22nd OMB and the 13th Jager, all known to exist, all from the right time. If the 32nd and the 37th OMB are the same, the ambiguity disappears, but some drill down will be needed here. \nThe Offensive Guard and the Marine Corps expansions do not appear in the tables and charts. The marines didn\u2019t announce until March, and the Offensive Guard is presumably Ukraine\u2019s affair. \n\nOrganization. \n\nOur discussion yesterday regarding whether 3 or 4 corps HQs were being formed seems laughably dated today, as the papers make clear the new units are being incorporated into the 9th and 10th corps.

The documents provide a rich tapestry of the equipage of seven other brigades, but there really wasn\u2019t much speculation beyond the MRAP issue.  Which is a huge issue.   All of our fears that MRAPs were viewed as full APCs under the expansion are confirmed.   One brigade, the 33rd, appears to have only MRAPs and nothing else, but take a look at their tank battalion- Leopard 2s!  It\u2019s the exact opposite to the 47th, with all Bradleys and T-55s.   We\u2019ll drill down on this later. \n\nDid the leak hurt?\n\nI\u2019m limiting my analysis to force composition, organization and training.  In this respect, not really. We already had the rough corners of expansion, training and equipage from publicly available info.  The corps level organization info is worrying but incomplete, as only the 9th and 10th corps units are identified.  The completion dates  make it clear that an April offensive was never contemplated, which isn\u2019t real helpful vis a vis Russian planning, but most realists already were clearly of the opinion that General Mud would curtail such early operations anyway.  The accuracy of the information argues strongly against the documents being fakes. \n\nI\u2019ll post something later regarding the 37th Brigade, but as stated,  I suspect there\u2019s just confusion regarding whether the unit is the 32nd or the 37th, rather than the possibility that a whole extra brigade was formed without announcement.",

The ~14k KIA (E: should be ~16k, but you get the point) would bring the total Ukraine casualties to only ~60k , well below the recent [120k](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/03/13/ukraine-casualties-pessimism-ammunition-shortage/) estimate from the west.\n\nWell, it now seems that Ukraine has a very high number of wounded compared to killed that I haven't seen reported anywhere previously.

So that 3.5 estimate I mentioned previously for Russians seems to match this leak, however it is significantly higher for Ukrainians. This new information makes the leaks in agreeance with all Western publicized estimates now. This does not mean the numbers themselves reflect reality, however, and we won't know that for certain for quite awhile.

Looks like they are seen as a very serious threat and Ukraine has no answer for them. \n\n\u2757\ufe0fWHY F-16 ARE IMPORTANT FOR UKRAINE\u2757\ufe0f\n\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\n\ud83d\udd35 THE BEST PROTECTION OF BODY REGIONS\nOn average, our air defense destroys about 75% of cruise missiles and attack drones. But 25% still reach their goals!\nCivilians die, infrastructure is destroyed. F-16s can effectively destroy these air threats even at the borders, preventing missiles and drones from reaching our cities.\n\n\ud83d\udd35 ADVANTAGE IN THE AIR \u2013 RELIABLE COVERAGE OF THE FRONTLINE\nRussian aviation outnumbers Ukrainian by many times, and most importantly, the occupiers have a technological advantage.\nThe Air Force does not have enough forces and assets, both ground and air, to effectively protect the airspace, troops on the front lines and civilians in the front-line zone from the daily terror of enemy attack aircraft and helicopters.\nF-16 will allow to gain air supremacy, significantly weakening the enemy, saving many lives every day.\n\n\ud83d\udd35 THE MOST EFFECTIVE DEFENSE AGAINST THE USE OF GUIDED AIR BOMBS\nIncreasingly, the enemy is using guided aerial bombs weighing 500 kg along the entire front line. There are signs of preparation for the mass use of 1,500 kg KABs!\nThe planes of the Russians do not enter the zone of damage of our air defense, striking remotely at the front line and near-frontline cities. Peaceful residents in the northern, southern, and eastern regions are suffering.\nThe F-16 is armed with air-to-air missiles with a range of up to 180 km. This will make it possible to drive enemy aircraft away from our borders and the line of combat, which will minimize the likelihood of using guided aerial bombs and other air-based weapons.\n\n\ud83d\udd35 POWERFUL KICK IN ANSWER\nThe wide range of modern high-precision weapons of the F-16 will allow for high-precision strikes on Russian troops during counter-offensive actions. It is necessary to stop the offensive actions of the enemy, to gain superiority in the air, to destroy the means of supply of equipment, ammunition and manpower of the enemy. F-16 will be able to perform these tasks!\n\n\ud83d\udd35 CONTROL OF THE SEA\nThe Black Sea is still under the control of the Russian fleet. F-16s are armed with powerful anti-ship missiles that can easily drive the entire enemy fleet either to ports or to the bottom of the sea. Ukraine needs to ensure freedom of navigation and protection of \"grain corridors\".\n\n\ud83d\udd35 PILOTS ARE HOSTAGES OF OLD TECHNOLOGIES\nThe available equipment and armament of Soviet aircraft turns all the missions of our pilots into mortally dangerous ones, which causes irreparable losses of the best sons of Ukraine. Only modern technologies will make their work effective and safe. Our pilots are trained and motivated to learn. And they are enough to fight and study at the same time. Our pilots dream of F-16, they deserve to fly on the best planes!\n\n\ud83d\udd35 SERVICEABILITY, SPARE PARTS\nUkraine uses 40-year-old aircraft. Some planes are twice as old as their pilots! It becomes more and more difficult to maintain their serviceability every day. Own stocks of spare parts are running low, and allies have none either. Many issues are closed through the so-called \"cannibalization\", but this cannot last forever. You can't wait until all aviation stops completely. Thanks to the transfer of aircraft from Slovakia and Poland, it will be possible to restore the MiG-29 aircraft fleet of several air brigades to a certain extent, and strengthen the capabilities of fighter aircraft to perform current combat missions. However, to achieve superiority in the air, to win, we need modern aircraft!\n\n\ud83d\udd35 STOCKS OF AMMUNITION\nStocks of even outdated and ineffective Soviet ammunition for the existing aircraft fleet are steadily decreasing. Even with a sufficient number of serviceable planes and trained pilots, at a certain point our aviation will be left without weapons. Switching to the F-16 or another Western platform with a wide range of modern weapons is the only way out!\n\n\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 Ukraine needs \u2708\ufe0f F-16!\n#FreeTheViper\n\nCommander of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine\nLieutenant General Mykola Oleschuk",

So, naturally, I'm hesitant to doubt them again this time. What do you all think, if the leaks are true?\n\nI've said it before and I'll say it again, this forum is a tier above any other discussion spot online, but it has it's own problems with acquiring and processing information, generally, as a collective.\n\nSpecifically, I think that people here like to (1) see themselves as an unofficial pro-Ukrianian defense problem-solving skunkworks, which is to say people do a lot of worst case scenario thinking, and (2) see themselves as above the ra-ra pro-Ukraine discourse where every American twitter user has a sunflower in their bio.\n\nSaw this with Bakhmut, which has been on the brink of catastrophic collapse for at least three months now. Lots of folks took in new information since the start of the year and sounded the alarms that, if that information was true, Ukraine was making a mistake by holding the city. What I didn't see a lot of discussion of was, if Ukraine was intent on holding the city, what set of facts made that a potentially positive move? Without asking that question, a lot of folks got blinded to what I think has been decently borne out (that reports of insane casualty ratios in favor of Russia were unfounded).\n\nHere again, I don't think people are asking the right questions. I've seen some suggestion that with the new air defense numbers in hand, Russia will start carpet bombing Ukrainian cities and force them to the negotiating table that way, or otherwise activate the VKS and bring about a swift new phase of conflict in which Russia dominates. But is it really plausible that a month ago, the US military knew that Ukraine's AD situation was so catastrophically dire, and the Russians didn't until some docs got leaked on discord? Because we know it isn't plausible that Russia knew and didn't act on the information. \n\nSo the natural question to ask is, why is Russia not exploiting Ukraine's Ad weakness? And I think that leads you to two obvious answers: either Russia doesn't have the air capacity we think they have, or Ukraine's AD situation is potentially better then it seems in the leaks, either in numbers or in some kind of mid-term plan to see them through. But people don't ask that question because the prevailing trend on here is to gameplan worst case scenarios and work backwards from there, which is wonderful if you want to plan contingencies for fringe scenarios, but actually not that great if you want to arrive at sensible conclusions base don the likely reality. \n\nMy overarching conceptual principle for a year now that, once momentum starts flowing one way, it becomes increasingly unlikely for it to stop and reverse course. Ukraine has surprised doubters because the UAF is structurally and institutionally better at functioning and adapting than their Russian counterparts. It is very hard to change those kinds of structural components in the middle of a war. I don't expect these doc leaks to be anything of note beside embarrassment for the American MIC that somehow let WowMao fans read their stuff.",

What do you all think, if the leaks are true?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve said it before and I&#39;ll say it again, this forum is a tier above any other discussion spot online, but it has it&#39;s own problems with acquiring and processing information, generally, as a collective.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, I think that people here like to (1) see themselves as an unofficial pro-Ukrianian defense problem-solving skunkworks, which is to say people do a lot of worst case scenario thinking, and (2) see themselves as above the ra-ra pro-Ukraine discourse where every American twitter user has a sunflower in their bio.</p>\n\n<p>Saw this with Bakhmut, which has been on the brink of catastrophic collapse for at least three months now. Lots of folks took in new information since the start of the year and sounded the alarms that, if that information was true, Ukraine was making a mistake by holding the city. What I didn&#39;t see a lot of discussion of was, if Ukraine was intent on holding the city, what set of facts made that a potentially positive move? Without asking that question, a lot of folks got blinded to what I think has been decently borne out (that reports of insane casualty ratios in favor of Russia were unfounded).</p>\n\n<p>Here again, I don&#39;t think people are asking the right questions. I&#39;ve seen some suggestion that with the new air defense numbers in hand, Russia will start carpet bombing Ukrainian cities and force them to the negotiating table that way, or otherwise activate the VKS and bring about a swift new phase of conflict in which Russia dominates. But is it really plausible that a month ago, the US military knew that Ukraine&#39;s AD situation was so catastrophically dire, and the Russians didn&#39;t until some docs got leaked on discord? Because we know it isn&#39;t plausible that Russia knew and didn&#39;t act on the information. </p>\n\n<p>So the natural question to ask is, why is Russia not exploiting Ukraine&#39;s Ad weakness? And I think that leads you to two obvious answers: either Russia doesn&#39;t have the air capacity we think they have, or Ukraine&#39;s AD situation is potentially better then it seems in the leaks, either in numbers or in some kind of mid-term plan to see them through. But people don&#39;t ask that question because the prevailing trend on here is to gameplan worst case scenarios and work backwards from there, which is wonderful if you want to plan contingencies for fringe scenarios, but actually not that great if you want to arrive at sensible conclusions base don the likely reality. </p>\n\n<p>My overarching conceptual principle for a year now that, once momentum starts flowing one way, it becomes increasingly unlikely for it to stop and reverse course. Ukraine has surprised doubters because the UAF is structurally and institutionally better at functioning and adapting than their Russian counterparts. It is very hard to change those kinds of structural components in the middle of a war. I don&#39;t expect these doc leaks to be anything of note beside embarrassment for the American MIC that somehow let WowMao fans read their stuff.</p>\n</div>",

            "body": "I think that there is no scenario in which a Chinese attack on Taiwan does not escalate into full scale World War 3. The calculations for the Chinese Communists are essentially the same as those of the Imperial Japanese Navy in WW2. Geography is a bitch, they are surrounded by a network of hostile powers, those powers are allied against them explicitly and will not allow a divide and conquer strategy to be effected against each in turn but require confrontation against the entire network simultaneously; and they control the vital inputs of food, energy and raw materials that make not just the Chinese war machine capable of functioning, but for the Chinese state itself to even exist.\n\nTaiwan in my view  remains a formidable opponent independently. But regardless of Taiwan itself there remains the Americans, and the Japanese. And the Australians. And the Koreans. And the Indians. And the British and the French. And the Russians.\n\nAmerican intervention, either real or prospective demands an attack either immedate or eventual on American bases and support in Guam, Okinawa, Japan, Korea, the Philippines, and Australia. It is impossible for example to imagine some sort of limited attack (as the CSIS report does for example) that is only against Guam, Okinawa and Japan without also attacking American bases in Korea and restarting the Korean War in full. It would be insanity for (the CSIS report scenario) USAF and UsN bases in Korea to be left as pristine bases for hundreds of F15s, F16s, F18s, F35s, F22, P8s and A10s,  together with all of their refuelling, transport and maintenance facilities whilsr other American positions are attacked. This both diverts considerable Chinese forces and munitions to the Korean and Japanese theatres (dilution) while bolstering the American alliance by activating the formidable Korean land, air and naval forces in close proximity to Beijing itself. The US maintains such a large garrison for a reason and it isn\u2019t just because of the naughty little rocket man.\n\nNaturally the Chinese who are in fact out numbered in quality naval and air assets by the combination of US, Korean, Taiwanese and Japanese forces (and out numbered in total air and naval forces once India, Australia, and NATO countries are included), will call on their only allies in Russia with its most important and largest naval forces being at Vladivostok, and North Korea -  who would at this point already be engaged against the Americans and South Koreans on the peninsula.\n\nThis is turn guarantees British, French and German involvement together with the rest of NATO against Russia in Europe, and the deployment of expeditionary NATO forces to support the Quad operations in the Indo Pacific (hello France and Britain). It also means the immediate destruction of every single Russian oil and gas pipeline into China, as well as the Trans Siberian Railway and supporting bridges. The \u201cRussia can supply China\u201d idea will be murdered in its cradle by C4 explosives and precision munitions.\n\nChina is at this point trapped and cut off not only from Russian supplies, but more importantly from its Indo Pacific life line in food, energy and raw materials. How to overcome this?\n\nThe range of Chinese military vessels is insufficient to reach the Indian ocean in force and sustain a presence that does anything other than fire a volley and go home. They cannot reach into Australia, NZ, and the Middle East or the African coastal states to extract food, energy and material supplies unless they can forward construct bases throughout the second island chain, primarily the Malay Peninsula, Singapore, Java, Sumatra, or the rest of the Archipelago\u2019 smaller and more controllable islands (Natuna comes to mind).\n\nBut how to accomplish this? Indonesia will remain neutral as long as it can but will be pressured to deny access as it is subject to the same geo economic constraints vis a vis not dying of starvation as China but without the requisite power to do anything about it. So while they can be invaded, they cannot be much more help than a hostile island in an enemy sea, and certainly no friend of China. Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei are all Anglo-Australian allies and defence guarantees, and Singapore\u2018s concentrated defences in air, missiles, surface and subsurface assets is more than capable of defeating a carrier battle group of the composition the PLA-N could send. We actually benefit if Singapore is brought into the war by some act of Chinese stupidity. Then there is Thailand, a neutral that wants no involvement, but is nominally a US ally and can spot a losing bet. They won\u2019t go for China unless the entire fleet has been sunk and China\u2019s breakout has achieved a 1942 level of success In fact the most that Thailand would provide is concessionary food shipments to China as once the walls of the second island chain are closed in around them the Chinese will need to source food and energy from within and are likely to use great violence to do so, especially from the second year and onwards. Thailand will be a supplicant exporter or an invaded foe.\n\nEach of these approaches to the Indian ocean is still further blockaded by Indian control of the Andamans, Australian/American control of the Java, Sunda and Timor straits, and NATO battle groups operating in the Indian Ocean as far afield as straits of Hormuz, Bab El Mandeb and the Southerm Cape. There\u2019s no chance here for China to gain a secure supply line in a war that lasts more than 2 weeks. Should this last into a second year, when stockpiles are low, energy is scarce and harvests are poor, things will become cataclysmic inside this geographic cauldron. Think imperial Japanese food rationing and looting in occupied territories in 1945 and plans for 1946 (including the deliberate starvation of Korea) but on a scale 10 times larger.\n\nStill to the eastern beginnings of the pacific ocean to New Guinea and the Solomons, or the Polynesian islands and these are controlled by Australia and the US and France and don\u2019t actually do anything or go anywhere important for the Chinese. They can be taken to threaten Australia and the southern front, but not to make any actual gain. And with most high quality, long range amphibious capscity (Type 71 and 75) sunk in Taiwan this is beyond their capabilities anyway. Don\u2019t expect China to be sailing ships to Argentina and Brazil to have sailors wearing cowboy hats, loading beef and soybeans and drinking tequilas any time soon. There will be no gauchos. Not even from Venezuela.\n\nWho is left? Just the overland route through Pakistan. If you think the Americans don\u2019t have enough reason to absolutely fucking hate Pakistan after all its perfidious treachery during the last 20 years, just wait until it becomes the sole import supply line for middle eastern oil into China during a war that will not be over by Christmas. Pakistan is going to get fucked up, between the Americans and the Indians things will be insanely violent here in what, outside of Korea, and Taiwan itself will be the primary land theatre of the China campaign (excluding whatever is happening in Europe vs Russia).\n\nIf China finds that route unreliable they can always try to get supplies from Iran, through Afghanistan, during a war against the US, Japan, India and NATO, without drawing the ire of Israel, Saudi Arabia, or Turkey.. Snowballs will last longer on the surface of the sun.\n\nMyanmar is not even an option for China despite providing in theory a decent access point from Yunnan, down the Irrawaddy, and out into the Indian Ocean. It may provide a basing facility to extend naval operating ranges, but those ships must first transit the archipelagic choke points intact to reach Burma, and will still be entirely within missile, air and naval attack from the alliance both at sea and in India. And any supplies still have to go around India and Sri Lanka to reach this possible terminus, and will still be sunk or boarded long before reaching it. Myanmar, outside of a prepositioned squadron, is just a non starter.\n\nAll of this is just to say that China in a Taiwan war must target only Taiwan to the total exclusion of all other targets including Americans in the hopes of preventing this sort of escallation scenario in time to present the world a fait accompli.. But if they do so avoid attacking the Americans, they open themselves up to being completely vulnerable to an un-degraded American response while or after being attrited by the Taiwanese. But if they attack the Americans, the war is no longer about Taiwan even remotely, and will not be over by Christmas. Instead attacks on Americans, especially the inevitable strikes in Japan and Korea will unravel the entire peace of the world until damn near everybody outside of south america is a direct belligerent and most of that is against China.\n\nThe situation for China is potentially so disastrous that should it even be remotely close to what I have outlined in scope or duration they will be left with little recourse other than nukes. That or we see a multi year non nuclear world war three for so long as no allied force crosses into mainland China or Russia, the conclusion of which is utterly anarchic and ambiguous.\n\nIn short, find a God and learn to pray.",

Tsai called Trump after he won the election to congratulate him, not the other way around. Trump at that time was not the President of USA, but President Elect.

Updating the passport is a change in the status quo? Cry me a river.\n\nThe reality is that Taiwan and China, or ROC and PRC, are two sovereign independent countries. Taiwan has never been part of the PRC. That is the status quo to the majority of Taiwanese people.\n\nThe beautiful thing about a democracy is that if you don't like the way one of your leaders leads the country, you can vote them out next election.
