Going back to last winter before Moscow launched its massive invasion, all three countries have hesitated before sending Ukraine the weapons it needs.

But the slow pace means that the war lasts longer than necessary and desirable. The Biden administration needs to state that its clear objective is to help Ukraine make the Russian presence in Ukraine untenable. The smart way to do that is to provide Kyiv the still longer-range artillery, missiles and drones (to three hundred kilometers), tanks, and aircraft (F-16s) enabling Ukraine to sever the land bridge to Crimea and thereby force a Russian retreat from southern Ukraine, making it extremely difficult for Russia to supply its military and more in Crimea.\n\nUkraine is going to be outnumbered in the new year after having manpower be a huge advantage throughout 2022. Leopards need to be sent ASAP. I hope for GLSDB. 20 F-16's flying defensive CAP missions with long range missiles is a huge boon. \n\n>France leads the way in European security\u2014and could strain relations with Germany\n\n>It is not only significant that France decided to go forward with delivering such military gear without other Western partners (its announcement coming a day ahead of Germany and the United States), but that France emphasized that it is indeed sending tanks. (Whether AMX-10 RCs are actually tanks is an open question for military experts.) \n\n>The delivery may not be the decisive military move to allow Ukraine to face the expected Russian offensive in spring. Instead, it is much more a political move: Coming a few weeks before the French-German Summit, the signal is not good for the two countries\u2019 relationship. It is too soon to tell the impact of French leadership in Europe, but France, more than Germany, seized the importance to demonstrate that a European country can also lead the way forward. Demonstrating its reliability as a partner behind Ukraine is a prerequisite to have its voice heard when the time comes to design a new European security architecture along with Ukraine and NATO allies.\n\nInteresting that there was coordination on the trio of vehicles from the 3 countries but that France unilaterally sent stuff forcing a scramble from Germany a day after.\n\nI applaud France for demonstrating the Europeans can and should lead on stuff. Leopards are better for this fight. Ukraine no matter how close and awesome between ties are between the US is going to be much secondary to the Pacific.",

        "body": "I was reading an interesting Twitter thread by a Dutch ex-AIVD member (secret intelligence service). He claims, that we are near a key point in the war and ased on his sources inside Russia, this is happening:\n\nKey points:\n\n- Putin radically ordered a change in mobilisation efforts, because of the disaster of the first one. \nOn 2 November a new 'mobilization committee' was formed.  This group of 'experts' had to set up the mobilization.  This time nothing must go wrong.\n\n- On 25 November, Russia started building a new database with connections to: all government agencies, all ministries, the secret services (FSB, GRU and SVR), the border control services,Municipalities, Police, Banks\n\n- If you are in the database, you cannot escape it. On December 27, the central bank linked all accounts of persons with debts/loans and those who do not pay alimony to the mobilization database.\n\n- These people (with payment arrears) are mobilized first, together with convicts.  The border with Belarus will be closed (until now Russians could travel between the two countries without a visa). The other borders are also being closed at the moment.\n\n- The mobilization starts on the 17th, first 'in silence'.  In March/April everything must run smoothly and there will be very large-scale mobilization, not 500,000, but continuously, initially at least 1 million (!!) men must be mobilized before May/June.\n\n- Anyone attempting to evade mobilization will be rounded up and detained.  They are then still forced into the army (separate unit that immediately goes to the front line). \n\n- Before the summer (May/June) they want at least 1,000,000 people for a major offensive.\n\n- Martial law will be proclaimed. War economy will oblige all factories to produce for the war.  So all clothing factories will make uniforms, metal factories will make weapons, engineering/steel/tractor factories will start producing vehicles.\n\n- The 100k+ deaths so far are 'nothing' in Putin's eyes, even if the upcoming 1 million mobilized will die it will not affect him.  He looks at the 20 million+ who died in WWII and Putin is willing to go at least that far.\n\n- The offensive comes from the east as well as from Belarus (towards Kiev).  Both with at least 500,000 troops.\n\n- He will not deploy nukes, not at all.  He has been warned by the US & UK that they will immediately go on the attack.  \nHe only considers it if Russia itself is going to be attacked.  If he tries to do this sooner, he will be dealt with internally.\n\n\nHere the full thread, in Dutch: https://twitter.com/envirosec/status/1612172738143059968?t=LirD9UMUtxyH7IDZk6lGEQ&s=19",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I was reading an interesting Twitter thread by a Dutch ex-AIVD member (secret intelligence service). He claims, that we are near a key point in the war and ased on his sources inside Russia, this is happening:</p>\n\n<p>Key points:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Putin radically ordered a change in mobilisation efforts, because of the disaster of the first one. \nOn 2 November a new &#39;mobilization committee&#39; was formed.  This group of &#39;experts&#39; had to set up the mobilization.  This time nothing must go wrong.</p></li>\n<li><p>On 25 November, Russia started building a new database with connections to: all government agencies, all ministries, the secret services (FSB, GRU and SVR), the border control services,Municipalities, Police, Banks</p></li>\n<li><p>If you are in the database, you cannot escape it. On December 27, the central bank linked all accounts of persons with debts/loans and those who do not pay alimony to the mobilization database.</p></li>\n<li><p>These people (with payment arrears) are mobilized first, together with convicts.  The border with Belarus will be closed (until now Russians could travel between the two countries without a visa). The other borders are also being closed at the moment.</p></li>\n<li><p>The mobilization starts on the 17th, first &#39;in silence&#39;.  In March/April everything must run smoothly and there will be very large-scale mobilization, not 500,000, but continuously, initially at least 1 million (!!) men must be mobilized before May/June.</p></li>\n<li><p>Anyone attempting to evade mobilization will be rounded up and detained.  They are then still forced into the army (separate unit that immediately goes to the front line). </p></li>\n<li><p>Before the summer (May/June) they want at least 1,000,000 people for a major offensive.</p></li>\n<li><p>Martial law will be proclaimed. War economy will oblige all factories to produce for the war.  So all clothing factories will make uniforms, metal factories will make weapons, engineering/steel/tractor factories will start producing vehicles.</p></li>\n<li><p>The 100k+ deaths so far are &#39;nothing&#39; in Putin&#39;s eyes, even if the upcoming 1 million mobilized will die it will not affect him.  He looks at the 20 million+ who died in WWII and Putin is willing to go at least that far.</p></li>\n<li><p>The offensive comes from the east as well as from Belarus (towards Kiev).  Both with at least 500,000 troops.</p></li>\n<li><p>He will not deploy nukes, not at all.  He has been warned by the US &amp; UK that they will immediately go on the attack.<br/>\nHe only considers it if Russia itself is going to be attacked.  If he tries to do this sooner, he will be dealt with internally.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here the full thread, in Dutch: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/envirosec/status/1612172738143059968?t=LirD9UMUtxyH7IDZk6lGEQ&amp;s=19\">https://twitter.com/envirosec/status/1612172738143059968?t=LirD9UMUtxyH7IDZk6lGEQ&amp;s=19</a></p>\n</div>",
