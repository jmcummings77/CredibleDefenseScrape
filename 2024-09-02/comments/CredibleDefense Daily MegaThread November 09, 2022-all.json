In which location they would have the maximum buffer zone against Ukrainian long range fires and the maximum defensive coverage from the Black Sea Fleet. They could even lay it down directly on the existing M-14 highway probably. I am frankly baffled that they haven't done so.\n\nIt was obvious that they might need a safer supply line into Kherson Oblast as early as June when the HIMARS interdiction campaign kicked off and their artillery advantage began to erode. So they've had at least 160 days to build such a railroad, and would have had maybe 30 more if they had planned for this contingency ahead of time and started as soon as Mariupol was sufficiently pacified.\n\nIt's not as if they'd have to negotiate rights-of-way or engage in any of the other peacetime bureaucratic processes that generally slow down public works like railroad development, so work should have gone quickly. It's around 100km from Mariupol to Taganrog (nearest rail line in Russia that links directly to Rostov) and 200km from Mariupol to Melitopol. Call it 300km of new tracks, laid over perfectly flat terrain. A mere 1.875km of progress per day would have completed those railways by now.

Russian Minister of Defense Sergey Shoigu publicly agreed with him. In October, the Kremlin began preparing the Russian public for a retreat in the region, which they assumed would be unpopular with pro-war Russians. Meanwhile, sources close to the Kremlin believe the announcement is meant to be an invitation to Ukraine to resume negotiations.\n\n>*On the Kherson front, our losses are seven to eight times less than the enemy\u2019s. We\u2019re thinking first and foremost of the lives of Russian soldiers. The decision to set up defense on the left bank of the Dnipro [that is, to retreat from Kherson] was not straightforward, but it will protect the lives of our soldiers and the combat-effectiveness of our troops.*\n\n>That\u2019s how Sergey Surovikin, commander of Russian forces in Ukraine, officially explained the necessity of leaving Kherson to Minister of Defense Sergey Shoigu. Shoigu accepted the argument and ordered the withdrawal of troops on live television.\n\n>Meduza sources who are close to the Kremlin were reporting a month ago that Russian troops might leave at least part of the Kherson region. In early November, they said the Kremlin considered the surrender of Kherson a \u201clikely but undesirable scenario.\u201d The final decision, according to sources, must be made by President Vladimir Putin.\n\n>Putin\u2019s administration wrote a manual for propagandists to prepare the public for a retreat in Kherson. It advised them to paint Ukraine as manipulative and bloodthirsty, and to emphasize that \u201cRussian troops seek to save the lives of civilians and personnel.\u201d\n\n>Surovikin repeated practically every one of the manual\u2019s points, as did Secretary of the General Council for United Russia, Andrey Turchak, who as of May was sure that Russia would be in Kherson \u201cforever.\u201d\n\n>\u201cOur boys near Kherson were subject to huge risks. They could be cut off from supply lines at any moment, and maintaining defense in that situation would be extremely complex\u2026The main purpose of today\u2019s maneuver is protecting the population while preserving as many personnel as possible,\u201d Turchak wrote on Telegram. \n\n>The Kremlin is well aware that Russians who support the war will receive news of the Russian army\u2019s retreat from Kherson \u201cvery negatively.\u201d Meduza\u2019s sources close to Putin\u2019s administration admitted that \u201cit\u2019s a problem.\u201d\n\n>Authorities hope that because of mobilization the majority of Russians will identify with the topic of saving soldiers\u2019 lives, which earlier propaganda also bet on. \u201cWhen members of your own family, your close friends, or even more distant acquaintances, are fighting, you relate differently to military actions,\u201d said one source.\n\n>According to another Kremlin source, the Security Council discussed a withdrawal from Kherson in early November in connection not only with the very difficult situation at the front, but also in the context of a return to negotiations with Ukraine.\n\n>\u201cIt\u2019s not only a military necessity, such a step is also an invitation to negotiations. **There\u2019s some change in negotiating positions,\u201d a source said. According to another Meduza source, negotiations are possible but not \u201cin the near term.\u201d And if they do happen, Russia\u2019s official position will be that Kherson, which it formally annexed in September, is \u201cterritory occupied by Ukraine.\u201d**\n\n>As Meduza has already reported, the Kremlin would likely not seek a full-fledged peace treaty in a new round of negotiations, but rather a temporary ceasefire. The Kremlin believes that the Russian and Ukrainian militaries could agree to this without the involvement of either country\u2019s president. Meduza\u2019s sources close to the Kremlin believed that Russia would be willing to return part of occupied Kherson in exchange for a ceasefire, buying the Russian army time to prepare a new full-fledged offensive.\n\n>A few hours before the withdrawal from Kherson was announced, Maria Zakharova, representative of Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry confirmed that \u201cRussia remains open to negotiating with Ukraine \u2013 of course, accounting for the realities of the present moment.\u201d\n\n>In a video address from November 7, Volodymyr Zelensky named five conditions for negotiating with Russia. \u201cAgain: restoration of territorial integrity, respect for the UN Charter, reparations for all damages caused by the war, punishment of every war criminal, and guarantees that this won\u2019t happen again,\u201d said the Ukrainian president.\n\n>He did not, however, repeat his earlier assertion that negotiations are impossible while Vladimir Putin remains president of Russia. Politico noted that, while US officials did not outright tell Zelensky to change his stance, they conveyed that Kyiv should \u201cdemonstrate its willingness\u201d to end the war by peaceful means.\n\n>**According to two sources close to the Kremlin, Vladimir Putin\u2019s positions have not changed. The Russian president is firm that Ukraine should at least recognize the Donbas and Crimea as Russian territory. Ideally, he intends to have Russia\u2019s right to all of the occupied territories recognized.** Putin\u2019s press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, did not answer Meduza\u2019s questions.",

In early November, they said the Kremlin considered the surrender of Kherson a \u201clikely but undesirable scenario.\u201d The final decision, according to sources, must be made by President Vladimir Putin.</p>\n\n<p>Putin\u2019s administration wrote a manual for propagandists to prepare the public for a retreat in Kherson. It advised them to paint Ukraine as manipulative and bloodthirsty, and to emphasize that \u201cRussian troops seek to save the lives of civilians and personnel.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Surovikin repeated practically every one of the manual\u2019s points, as did Secretary of the General Council for United Russia, Andrey Turchak, who as of May was sure that Russia would be in Kherson \u201cforever.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOur boys near Kherson were subject to huge risks. They could be cut off from supply lines at any moment, and maintaining defense in that situation would be extremely complex\u2026The main purpose of today\u2019s maneuver is protecting the population while preserving as many personnel as possible,\u201d Turchak wrote on Telegram. </p>\n\n<p>The Kremlin is well aware that Russians who support the war will receive news of the Russian army\u2019s retreat from Kherson \u201cvery negatively.\u201d Meduza\u2019s sources close to Putin\u2019s administration admitted that \u201cit\u2019s a problem.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Authorities hope that because of mobilization the majority of Russians will identify with the topic of saving soldiers\u2019 lives, which earlier propaganda also bet on. \u201cWhen members of your own family, your close friends, or even more distant acquaintances, are fighting, you relate differently to military actions,\u201d said one source.</p>\n\n<p>According to another Kremlin source, the Security Council discussed a withdrawal from Kherson in early November in connection not only with the very difficult situation at the front, but also in the context of a return to negotiations with Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not only a military necessity, such a step is also an invitation to negotiations. <strong>There\u2019s some change in negotiating positions,\u201d a source said. According to another Meduza source, negotiations are possible but not \u201cin the near term.\u201d And if they do happen, Russia\u2019s official position will be that Kherson, which it formally annexed in September, is \u201cterritory occupied by Ukraine.\u201d</strong></p>\n\n<p>As Meduza has already reported, the Kremlin would likely not seek a full-fledged peace treaty in a new round of negotiations, but rather a temporary ceasefire. The Kremlin believes that the Russian and Ukrainian militaries could agree to this without the involvement of either country\u2019s president. Meduza\u2019s sources close to the Kremlin believed that Russia would be willing to return part of occupied Kherson in exchange for a ceasefire, buying the Russian army time to prepare a new full-fledged offensive.</p>\n\n<p>A few hours before the withdrawal from Kherson was announced, Maria Zakharova, representative of Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry confirmed that \u201cRussia remains open to negotiating with Ukraine \u2013 of course, accounting for the realities of the present moment.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In a video address from November 7, Volodymyr Zelensky named five conditions for negotiating with Russia. \u201cAgain: restoration of territorial integrity, respect for the UN Charter, reparations for all damages caused by the war, punishment of every war criminal, and guarantees that this won\u2019t happen again,\u201d said the Ukrainian president.</p>\n\n<p>He did not, however, repeat his earlier assertion that negotiations are impossible while Vladimir Putin remains president of Russia. Politico noted that, while US officials did not outright tell Zelensky to change his stance, they conveyed that Kyiv should \u201cdemonstrate its willingness\u201d to end the war by peaceful means.</p>\n\n<p><strong>According to two sources close to the Kremlin, Vladimir Putin\u2019s positions have not changed. The Russian president is firm that Ukraine should at least recognize the Donbas and Crimea as Russian territory. Ideally, he intends to have Russia\u2019s right to all of the occupied territories recognized.</strong> Putin\u2019s press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, did not answer Meduza\u2019s questions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

My guess is that their audience slants towards contrarians who have inflated impressions of Russian competence.</p>\n</div>",

Strike after strike would slowly degrade these capabilities.\n\nNot really. Hitting a reinforced concrete and steel girder bridge with HIMARS means major engineering repairs. Hitting a pontoon bridge means the cheap floating span being replaced. Each ferry is just 1-3 pontoon bridge spans lashed together with 1-2 small boats for propulsion. At best HIMARS can only harass them on a short term basis (especially the ferries that rarely remain in one location long enough for a grid fire mission to be planned and executed).\n\n>Ukraine could push close enough to the river so that the crossings could be heavily shelled.\n\nUnless they had continuous drones overhead, it would be blind firing. Just because artillery is in range doesn't mean it'll be effective, we've seen on both sides now main supply routes being in range of enemy arty and still not interdicted. The simplest way to view it, the entirety of all tactical formations below the corps/field army equivalent level are within enemy artillery range and that doesn't mean they are destroyed. \n\n>Kherson was heavily defended and fortified but a rout is still a possibility. Russia being forced up against the river would be an disaster.\n\nThis is likely the reason it happened. It wasn't that a rout was certain, far from it. It was that a major defeat couldn't be risked anymore, the Kharkiv counteroffensive was too shocking and painful for Putin's govt, and too recent. Better to suffer the humiliation of a retreat from the Kherson bridgehead versus the horror show of an operational level disaster.",

If they believe the UAF will attack in force as they are retreating, the Russians will be very motivated to find ways to slow them down, dissuade them, and that means lots of ambushes, mines, booby traps, destroyed roads and bridges, etc. This is bread and butter maneuver defense, which is heavily emphasized in Russian operational theory and doctrine. \n\n>Now the Ukrainian brass likely suspect that, so assuming the open source reports of Russian retreat are true, they still won't attack right now, just wait.

Potentially all routes from the first to the second line will be obstructed by mud or minefields, with limited designated lanes for retreating Russian rear guard forces to pass through the second line, to keep going to a third line of defenses or beyond.\n\n>The Kherson bridgehead campaign really can turn into a great lesson on real Russian capabilities, how well they can fight when they're actually concentrated, alert, and focused.\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/ymryp5/credibledefense_daily_megathread_november_05_2022/iv7722w?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3",

        "body": "I want to highlight something in my own opinion I view as important. So Russia waits til the day after the American midterms to formally announce the official retreat from Kherson, but I am seeing something else as well: now the main propaganda organs are disavowing the last few month\u2019s worth of messaging and preparing Russians for more strategic defeat. We are seeing two complete reversals here, not just Kherson but also Russian propaganda messaging.\n\nI have watched nearly every one of Julia\u2019s videos, I highly suggest you watch today\u2019s, it is a shocking video:\n\n1) I am going to put this one first, this may seem superficial but it is absolutely not, the freeze frames on two of the actors today were absolutely outrageous. I have never seen the show take screen caps that were positively absurd, and it looks like an intentional attempt at subversive messaging from the curators of the show, either to delegitimize the show to viewers or to delegitimize the actors\u2019 messages, or both.\n\n2) the constant stream of \u201cwe are strategic losers\u201d on Russian state TV has had a devastating impact on their public\u2019s willingness to be mobilized and engaged in the war. The trend continues but today\u2019s was especially realistic: \u2018We are not winning this war, the government said we will take back Kharkiv but we didn\u2019t, we can\u2019t win without modern weapons, the U.S. will not change policy based on flakes within the Republican Party.\u2019 \n\n3) today\u2019s script is a complete 180\u00b0 on the prior months of the writers\u2019 scripts to some extent. Note they are airing this messaging the day after American midterms. I guess expect brand new Russian formulaic messaging to coalesce arround something? They usually suggest the new narrative if they abandon the old one.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I want to highlight something in my own opinion I view as important. So Russia waits til the day after the American midterms to formally announce the official retreat from Kherson, but I am seeing something else as well: now the main propaganda organs are disavowing the last few month\u2019s worth of messaging and preparing Russians for more strategic defeat. We are seeing two complete reversals here, not just Kherson but also Russian propaganda messaging.</p>\n\n<p>I have watched nearly every one of Julia\u2019s videos, I highly suggest you watch today\u2019s, it is a shocking video:</p>\n\n<p>1) I am going to put this one first, this may seem superficial but it is absolutely not, the freeze frames on two of the actors today were absolutely outrageous. I have never seen the show take screen caps that were positively absurd, and it looks like an intentional attempt at subversive messaging from the curators of the show, either to delegitimize the show to viewers or to delegitimize the actors\u2019 messages, or both.</p>\n\n<p>2) the constant stream of \u201cwe are strategic losers\u201d on Russian state TV has had a devastating impact on their public\u2019s willingness to be mobilized and engaged in the war. The trend continues but today\u2019s was especially realistic: \u2018We are not winning this war, the government said we will take back Kharkiv but we didn\u2019t, we can\u2019t win without modern weapons, the U.S. will not change policy based on flakes within the Republican Party.\u2019 </p>\n\n<p>3) today\u2019s script is a complete 180\u00b0 on the prior months of the writers\u2019 scripts to some extent. Note they are airing this messaging the day after American midterms. I guess expect brand new Russian formulaic messaging to coalesce arround something? They usually suggest the new narrative if they abandon the old one. Today is notable because they don\u2019t appear to have a hold of the new one, and yet it is about as negative a script as I have ever seen.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/JuliaDavisNews/status/1590377796655673345\">https://twitter.com/JuliaDavisNews/status/1590377796655673345</a></p>\n\n<p>Side note, among Putin\u2019s strategic objectives (and these exact themes were on state media) were \u201chope for a gas price squeeze to break European unity\u201d (this was accompanied by frequent mockery of the EU) and \u201cRepublican wins will break U.S. support for democracy\u201d (accompanied by taunts that they control American elections).

I guarantee you ~85% of the content is completely, undisputably, factual. It is spun and editorialized, but still factual. 15% is straight up disinfo and lies. It immediately becomes apparent they use a different formula on western media. So, first you need to build a western audience to serve, you can\u2019t simply serve lies all the time or you won\u2019t build one. Then once you have the audience, you slip in the straight disinfo where needed.\n\nSimilarly, Russian accounts on Reddit use the same formula. 85% factual content, mercilessly spun and twisted, with about 15% straight up lies and disinfo.\n\nThat\u2019s how you successfully build a Western audience that will tolerate and then become an audience for your campaign as a commenter in certain subreddits, and a poster in r/combatfootage. Now, combat footage is a special case, because the messaging on Russian combat victories is split across accounts by the daily limit as a necessity.

I guarantee you ~85% of the content is completely, undisputably, factual. It is spun and editorialized, but still factual. 15% is straight up disinfo and lies. It immediately becomes apparent they use a different formula on western media. So, first you need to build a western audience to serve, you can\u2019t simply serve lies all the time or you won\u2019t build one. Then once you have the audience, you slip in the straight disinfo where needed.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, Russian accounts on Reddit use the same formula. 85% factual content, mercilessly spun and twisted, with about 15% straight up lies and disinfo.</p>\n\n<p>That\u2019s how you successfully build a Western audience that will tolerate and then become an audience for your campaign as a commenter in certain subreddits, and a poster in <a href=\"/r/combatfootage\">r/combatfootage</a>.

Ukraine stops being a failed state wholly reliant on Western goodwill; Ukrainians can put up with a lot of suffering, but not infinite suffering. Putin has a better chance of maintaining power without economic and civil unrest from the war, and he gets to die seeing Crimea under Russian control.\n\nHow much monetary compensation Russia would pay is hard to estimate so whatever makes sense.

With this reality in mind, there is no point in upholding a war of attrition with questionable outcomes at play while the conflict continues to have a destabilising effect at a global level.\n\nWe are living in consequential times. Iran is on the front verge of becoming a full-blown nuclear power that could trigger either US or Israeli intervention next year, while North Korea continues to bolster its missile capabilities and nuclear program.

            "body": "The far right, from what I've seen, considers no sacrifice too great to stop the evil Western hordes. Even if millions need to die, that is a preferable outcome to stop pronouns/Ukrainians/whatever. They'll fight to the last Russian, if need be. Not surprising, considering that far rightists worldwide since the rise of fascism have had similar apocalyptic views.\n\nThe far left is a little more varied. I'd spread out their views like so:\n\n1) Wow, Ukraine really can win and this war is worth fighting--despite any problems with the Ukrainian state (Nazi battalions, corruption, etc) or NATO (NATO bad), their people are fighting for national self-determination and the core, universal values that stem from that. And despite issues with NATO, supporting Ukraine was clearly the right call.\n\n2) Ukrainians are still Nazis and NATO is bad, so even if this operation is going poorly, we must continue to support it in the hopes it weakens NATO and the West.\n\n3) Why can't there be peace? I want peace at any cost, even if it harms everyone and benefits no one.\n\n4) As the contradictions of the Ukrainian and Russian state heighten, the proletariat in both must rise up, stop the war, and reinstitute the Soviet state as constituted by Lenin.\n\nOf the above, 2 is I think an increasing minority of a minority position. As Russian crimes escalate, and as Ukraine fights on and wins, only the corrupt or accerlationist Left remains--and they are jokes. 3 is I think a normie, wishful thinking take--war bad, why war no stop? Alas, wars must be fought, won, and lost. You can't end a war by not fighting it. 4 is left to the remaining Marxist-Leninists, who try to spark the embers of 1917, over and over again in an era that has long since disparaged that revolution. They have no serious pull anywhere, not even in China, where one would think they'd have ideological allies (China seems to be taking position #2, for what it is worth, albeit for different reasons (geopolitics) than the ones I mentioned above).\n\nAs I've stated elsewhere before, I am a member of 1). Yes, I consider myself Far Left. Yes, I support Ukraine and NATO's support of Ukraine. We exist.",
            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>The far right, from what I&#39;ve seen, considers no sacrifice too great to stop the evil Western hordes. Even if millions need to die, that is a preferable outcome to stop pronouns/Ukrainians/whatever. They&#39;ll fight to the last Russian, if need be. Not surprising, considering that far rightists worldwide since the rise of fascism have had similar apocalyptic views.</p>\n\n<p>The far left is a little more varied. I&#39;d spread out their views like so:</p>\n\n<p>1) Wow, Ukraine really can win and this war is worth fighting--despite any problems with the Ukrainian state (Nazi battalions, corruption, etc) or NATO (NATO bad), their people are fighting for national self-determination and the core, universal values that stem from that. And despite issues with NATO, supporting Ukraine was clearly the right call.</p>\n\n<p>2) Ukrainians are still Nazis and NATO is bad, so even if this operation is going poorly, we must continue to support it in the hopes it weakens NATO and the West.</p>\n\n<p>3) Why can&#39;t there be peace? I want peace at any cost, even if it harms everyone and benefits no one.</p>\n\n<p>4) As the contradictions of the Ukrainian and Russian state heighten, the proletariat in both must rise up, stop the war, and reinstitute the Soviet state as constituted by Lenin.</p>\n\n<p>Of the above, 2 is I think an increasing minority of a minority position. As Russian crimes escalate, and as Ukraine fights on and wins, only the corrupt or accerlationist Left remains--and they are jokes. 3 is I think a normie, wishful thinking take--war bad, why war no stop? Alas, wars must be fought, won, and lost.

Not only does it generate electricity, but the additional sheer amount of water would deepen defense lines and likely make any additional moves south of the Dnieper impossible for Ukraine--at least from that axis (an assault towards Mariupol is still feasible).\n\nAs for the overall analysis: once Russia's lightning victory vanished into thin air in the days after Feb 24, the Kherson salient was untenable. Russia would never be able to supply enough men and arms to continue towards Odesa.

When they&#39;re voting for their congressman/senator it probably goes overall economy, then crime (this overlaps with fears of minorities and culture war stuff), then culture war stuff like abortion, then stuff like transportation/money for their district, then stuff like climate change/water/fires/floods.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes foreign policy is considered if there&#39;s a big glaring example of something bad happening, like Iraq during Bush&#39;s 2nd term.
