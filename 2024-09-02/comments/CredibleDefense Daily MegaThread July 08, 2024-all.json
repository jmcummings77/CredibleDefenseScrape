        "body": "So u/macktruck6666 wrote an interesting question in yesterday's thread:\n\n>Random question:\n\n>Why is the P51 faster than the Pilatus PC-21, Super Tucano, and TAI Hurkus while they all have identical horsepower and the P51 is bigger?\n\nSo this is a reason to be VERY wary of Wikipedia, especially when looking up statistics from different eras that are hard to decipher for non-aviators as source documents are not as clear as they are today.\n\nThe P-51 and Super Tucano and T-6A/B Texan II aren't too far off in specs (weight, dimensions, horsepower - though of note, the trainers do have less horsepower than either, but are also lighter\n\nBUT, the actual speeds aren't that different. \n\nBackground: I've had personal flight experience in a Commemorative Air Force P-51D (modified to have a backseat and stick) as well a Super Tucano's cousin (the T-6 Texan IIs, never got time in an A-29 itself) and the P-51 is nowhere near as fast in flight as most people think or as Wikipedia would mislead you.\n\nDon't believe my anecdotal story? Sure, read on:\n\nFor one, Wikipedia doesn't give you a good gauge for WHAT airspeed is being measured. They say max speed for the P-51 is 440 mph with a cruise speed of 362 mph. \n\nThey appear to have taken these numbers [from this source](http://www.wwiiaircraftperformance.org/mustang/p-51-tactical-chart.jpg) which states that at normal combat weight (~9000 lbs), you could hit 440 mph at war emergency power at 30,000 feet.\n\nNow, notice how the top speed is lower as you get lower in altitude for the same power. Notice how rate of climb drops as you go higher in altitude.\n\nPropeller planes lose power as they get higher in altitude - so rate of climb decreasing as you climb is valid. But why is speed faster despite less power than at lower altitudes? \n\nBecause TRUE airspeed goes up as you get higher in altitude. \n\nSo are they measuring INDICATED/CALIBRATED airspeed (as seen on your instruments) or TRUE airspeed (true airspeed through the air mass)? \n\nBecause your indicated airspeed (which is roughly what your aircraft is measuring as its interaction with the air... hence stall speeds are typically based on your indicated airspeed) at higher altitudes will be much lower than your true airspeed - but you want true airspeed corrected for wind to get your groundspeed to measure your actual speed over the ground, which is what you use to figure out navigation.\n\nSo what is the P-51 actually referencing? \n\nTurns out, [it is more often TRUE airspeed](http://www.wwiiaircraftperformance.org/mustang/mustangtest.html)than indicated airspeed! Note that almost all the figures being thrown around for top speeds are roughly 440ish mph in true airspeed.\n\n440 mph = 382 knots. So for true airspeed at 30k, that's approximately 242 knots calibrated on a standard day.\n\nYou should note that the speeds listed for the Super Tucano and T-6 Texan II for max speed are also its never exceed speed (~316-320 knots indicated). 316-320 KIAS at even 20k is ~425 knots... 489 mph. That's way faster than the top speed of the P-51!\n\nThat's the never exceed speed, however, which usually is some fuselage/airframe limit and not normally achievable in straight and level flight.\n\nNavy CNATRA (flight training) publishes the T-6B Texan II's primary contact training publication: https://www.cnatra.navy.mil/local/docs/pat-pubs/P-764.pdf\n\nNote on page 83 of the PDF, that FAST CRUISE is 240 KIAS (80% power) - normal cruise is 200 KIAS (54% power).\n\nAgain, that's INDICATED airspeed. So at fast cruise at 30,000 feet... 240 KIAS (assuming no major instrumentation errors) gets you ~378 KTAS which is ~434 mph.\n\nIs 440 mph slower than 434 mph?\n\nOf course not. Note too that those are without the T-6B at MIL power - which means they could conceivably go even faster (not necessarily at 30k of course, you have less power available).\n\nSo no, the P-51 is not drastically faster than the Super Tucano or other modern turboprops.\n\nIt's one of my favorite things to remind flight students I come across flying the T-6A/B: you're being trusted to fly an airplane that performs similar to, or outperformed, most of the top of the line WW2-era fighters. So really take it in and enjoy what you're being entrusted to do.",

        "body": "Today I will post an update on the mobilization in Ukraine as well as on Russian losses; tomorrow a review on the news along the front line - I would have liked to publish it today but after that the post would have been too long. \n\nRoman Kostenko, secretary of the National Security, Defense and Intelligence Committee of the Verkhovna Rada, [stated](https://meta.ua/news/war-in-ukraine/180251-ukraina-smozhet-mobilizovat-200-tisyach-chelovek-do-kontsa-goda-kostenko-nazval-uslovie/) that Ukraine's recruitment potential until the end of the year is 200,000 men, if the current pace is maintained. That would reportedly bring the personnel of the UAF to record levels.\n\nThis should confirm my estimate that at the moment (in the last two months, I mean) the pace of recruitment in Ukraine is around 30,000 men per month; about equal to the Russian figure. The latters have to make up for heavier losses, but their current situation is considerably better in terms of staffing levels in their formations. \n\nWith 10 days left before the deadline, nearly 3,2 million Ukrainians [have uploaded](https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/07/07/vzhe-ponad-3-miljona-ukrayincziv-onovyly-svoyi-oblikovi-dani/) their personal data through the prescribed methods (particularly on the \"Reserv+\" app). In the update of late June, it was [stated](https://censor.net/ua/news/3496450/pislya_onovlennya_danyh_ye_ponad_milyion_potentsiyinyh_mobilizovanyh) that out of 2,3 million Ukrainians who had uploaded their data up to that point, 1,1 million were eligible for mobilization, as they did not fall under the ongoing exemptions (still a very high number). \n\nThe Minister of Education [announced](https://censor.net/ua/news/3496381/minosvity_zminyuye_pravyla_vstupu_v_aspiranturu) that they will change the way postgraduate education is accessed (let\u2019s recall that university students and PhD candidates are exempt from mobilization). Until 2022, 7/8 thousand people were enrolled in postgraduate programs annually. In 2024, 246 thousand people signed up for the entrance test. Of these, 91,5 thousands were men aged \n25-60 years old who already have a master's degree. Now the admission will be controlled by the state and the enrollment in postgraduate studies will be possible only in forms which don\u2019t carry the right of deferment from mobilization.\n\nIn any case, Kostenko [had stated](https://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2024/06/19/7461561/) that the Ukrainian authorities are very satisfied with the new mobilization pace, and if this is maintained over the summer, in October proposals about demobilizing those fighting since February 2022 could take place. \n\nThe first groups of newly mobilized troops which were summoned after the new law took effect (on May 18) [are expected](https://www.unian.net/society/mobilizaciya-v-ukraine-deputat-rasskazal-kogda-vsu-poluchat-popolnenie-novymi-podgotovlennymi-boycami-12685653.html) to join their assigned combat units in late August. Indeed, at the moment the situation at the front remains critical, and the brigades will be able to be replenished to acceptable levels only in a month and a half. But as I have written several times in the past, training is another very critical issue. Overall, the duration of this (and sometimes the quality!) remains insufficient to properly train soldiers for the challenges that await them at the front. Last year the deputy chief of staff of the Air Assault Forces [had stated](https://nv.ua/ukr/ukraine/events/mobilizaciya-skilki-trivaye-navchannya-pered-vidpravkoyu-na-front-bez-dosvidu-i-obmezheno-pridatnih-50359625.html) that the average training of a newly mobilized person assigned to them is between 1 and 2 months, which is too short for someone joining an elite corps.\n\nIt\u2019s also [reported](https://www.unian.net/war/mobilizaciya-v-minoborony-ocenili-uroven-mobilizacii-v-ukraine-12679140.html) that there has been a \"significant increase\" in the number of contracts signed, by those who want to join as volunteers. Last month it was reported that about 25% of new recruits are volunteers. Last time I had also [written](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/1dioxgh/comment/l985mk8/) on the new bonuses introduced recently for the new contract soldiers. By the end of the year, the number of recruitment centers (managed by the UAF) over the country will grow to 40 units. Ukrainians can look up for vacancies in the various brigades there and sign a contract directly with their representatives, bypassing much of the TRC\u2019s duties. The 26th has been opened recently in Brovary, near Kyiv.\n\nHowever, the current pace of mobilization is likely to hurt Ukrainian businesses, due to the decrease of the workforce. It\u2019s [reported](https://censor.net/ua/news/3496132/robotodavtsi_v_ukrayini_pochaly_zaproshuvaty_na_robotu_inozemtsiv) that a number of foreign workers (mainly from countries such as Nepal, Pakistan, India, Uzbekistan, but also Moldova) are arriving in Western Ukraine to work, particularly in specialized roles in the construction sector - which has lost 300,000 jobs in Ukraine (1/4 of the total) since the beginning of the \"Great War\u201d. There are many vacancies in Western Ukraine and to a lesser extent in Central Ukraine (this [article](https://www.work.ua/articles/analytics/3280/) shows the change in vacancies compared to the pre-war period), mostly because of the relocation there of many companies that were based in the East and in the South of the country.\n\nThe CEO of the State Specialized Forest Enterprise \u201cForests of Ukraine\u201d [reported](https://censor.net/ua/news/3496607/schodnya_povistky_otrymuyut_ponad_100_lisnykiv_bolohovets) that over the recent weeks more than 100 (!) loggers per day (which are concentrated in the Carpathian and Polesian regions) are receiving summons, whereas a year ago this figure was one-tenth of that. It\u2019s reported that the vast majority of them are fulfilling their duty by showing up at the local TRC, but this is creating problems for the labor force in this sector (much of the production is exported, which means foreign currency inflows into Ukraine), and they are aiming to hire young people under 25 and retirees over 60 to make up for this.\n\nThere are big differences on how the various TRCs act: there are regions where they are quite chill and others where they can be harsh. A football team of the first league from Khust (Transcarpathia) [will play](https://censor.net/ua/news/3496114/klub_ne_moje_otrymaty_bronyuvannya_vid_armiyi_fk_hust_zminyuye_propysku_cherez_mobilizatsiyu) its matches in Ternopil in the next football season, due to the refusal of players from other teams to travel by bus to play in that town, because of the road checkpoints by the dreaded TRC of Transcarpathia Oblast (where, it must be said, the % of both fallen and mobilized residents since the beginning of the war is actually lower than in the surrounding regions). \n\nA bill to reform the \"reservation\" system is [expected](https://censor.net/ua/news/3498194/ekonomichne_bronyuvannya_u_radi_rozpovily_koly_vynesut_na_rozglyad) to go to a vote in the Verkhovna Rada by the end of the month. Companies will be able to reserve up to 50% of their employees; energy and defense companies will be able to exempt up to 100% of them. Therefore IT companies, which until now could reserve 100% of their employees (thanks to the foreign currency inflows their business brings to Ukraine), might lose their privilege. Kyivmiskvitlo, an utility company from Kyiv, [reported](https://biz.censor.net/news/3497001/kyyivmisksvitlo_vidkrylo_nyzku_robitnychyh_vakansiyi_cherez_brak_kadriv) a labor shortage in its ranks, after 27% of its employees joined or were mobilized in the UAF. Currently, nationwide, [there are](https://nv.ua/ukr/ukraine/events/v-ukrajini-ponad-560-tisyach-zabronovanih-viyskovozobov-yazanih-cholovikiv-50432406.html) 565,000 \u201cbooked\u201d workers. Firms will be able to exempt their workers by paying 20 thousand Hryvnias per month (as much as an average gross salary): a really high amount. Self-employed people will have to pay the same amount to avoid mobilization. Second part below.",

A football team of the first league from Khust (Transcarpathia) <a href=\"https://censor.net/ua/news/3496114/klub_ne_moje_otrymaty_bronyuvannya_vid_armiyi_fk_hust_zminyuye_propysku_cherez_mobilizatsiyu\">will play</a> its matches in Ternopil in the next football season, due to the refusal of players from other teams to travel by bus to play in that town, because of the road checkpoints by the dreaded TRC of Transcarpathia Oblast (where, it must be said, the % of both fallen and mobilized residents since the beginning of the war is actually lower than in the surrounding regions). </p>\n\n<p>A bill to reform the &quot;reservation&quot; system is <a href=\"https://censor.net/ua/news/3498194/ekonomichne_bronyuvannya_u_radi_rozpovily_koly_vynesut_na_rozglyad\">expected</a> to go to a vote in the Verkhovna Rada by the end of the month. Companies will be able to reserve up to 50% of their employees; energy and defense companies will be able to exempt up to 100% of them. Therefore IT companies, which until now could reserve 100% of their employees (thanks to the foreign currency inflows their business brings to Ukraine), might lose their privilege. Kyivmiskvitlo, an utility company from Kyiv, <a href=\"https://biz.censor.net/news/3497001/kyyivmisksvitlo_vidkrylo_nyzku_robitnychyh_vakansiyi_cherez_brak_kadriv\">reported</a> a labor shortage in its ranks, after 27% of its employees joined or were mobilized in the UAF. Currently, nationwide, <a href=\"https://nv.ua/ukr/ukraine/events/v-ukrajini-ponad-560-tisyach-zabronovanih-viyskovozobov-yazanih-cholovikiv-50432406.html\">there are</a> 565,000 \u201cbooked\u201d workers. Firms will be able to exempt their workers by paying 20 thousand Hryvnias per month (as much as an average gross salary): a really high amount. Self-employed people will have to pay the same amount to avoid mobilization. Second part below.</p>\n</div>",

            "body": "As for the enlistment of convicts, according to datas gathered by [Le Monde](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/07/03/yaroslav-nimets-ukrainian-prisoner-and-volunteer-soldier-we-understand-very-clearly-where-we-re-going_6676490_4.html), more than 5,500 Ukrainian inmates are joining their country's Defense Forces. This is already a satisfactory number: the Ministry of Justice estimated in April that around 4,500 convicts would volunteer. The average volunteer is a fairly young man in jail for theft or robbery and very determined on serving. Inmates will mostly join assault companies created within the brigades that accept them. There are some brigades that categorically refuse to accept inmates; on the contrary, the 3rd Assault Brigade wants to do an experiment of putting one inmate in a regular squad, 3/4 in a platoon and see how they perform, without creating separate penal units. It must be said that there is actually a huge competition among the brigades for the convicts. Especially for those from the first waves of volunteers, which will made up of prisoners with past combat experience and/or who are more psychologically ready and more patriotic. Some penal colonies have already been visited by representatives of a dozen different brigades. Recruiting is thus not in the hands of the MoD as in Russia after February 2023, but in the hands of individual brigades, which often send them representatives who have been in jail in the past and speak the same \"language\" as the inmates, using their slang, etc. \n\nThen there is the problem of the age and physical fitness of the recruits. Some of the mobilized (but also support personnel) are over 50, sometimes with poor physical shape and some medical conditions. According to what I have learnt, the 79th Air Assault Brigade (fighting in the Kurakhove sector and facing a continuous Russian offensive that began over 10 months ago) has \"sent back\" 20 to 50% of the men from the \"batches\" of rear personnel that were assigned to it the past few months to replenish its ranks, due to them being too old or in poor physical shape (other brigades don\u2019t worry much about that). The brigades of the Air Assault Forces cannot have soldiers older than 45 (and they have priority in receiving the younger mobilized men), which on the other hand is almost the starting age in certain separate rifle or territorial defense battalions (the latters initially had quite a lot of young men, who over time decided to join other units or more recently were forcibly transferred to the Air Assault Forces or to the Marine Corps). \n\nThe National Guard is by far the youngest branch of the Defense Forces, due to the high number of young people who were in it at the beginning of the invasion or have consequently volunteered in its units. According to the [Minister of the Interior](https://censor.net/ua/news/3495783/klymenko_pro_seredniyi_vik_biyitsiv_zsu), the average age in the NG is just 30. Its 12th \"Azov\" Brigade has likely the lowest average age of any Ukrainian combat unit, as there are lots of of under-25 volunteers in the brigade. In the 3rd Assault Brigade too the average age is low, thanks to the young people who go there as volunteers (including from other brigades). A battalion commander in the 3rd Assault Brigade (I believe of one of the two rifle battalions formed in early 2024) [said](https://censor.net/ua/news/3495833/kuharchuk_pro_mobilizatsiyu) that the average age in his battalion is 33, and less than 30 for the stormtroopers. This is in contrast to the second/third tier units where the average age is often very close to 50. \n\nThat said, there are also many relatively young men among the newly mobilized, even in the new or in the less renowned units. For example, digging through Ukrainian social media, I was able to find the Instagram and TikTok profiles of a man recently mobilized and assigned to the new 157th Infantry Brigade (possibly raised in Zaporizhzhia). Usually infantry brigades have a pretty high average age, although he and his comrades-in-arms appear to be in their mid/late 30s (I will not share photos to protect their identities). They are living in the woods; this both trains them for the life at the front (where most of the shelters are in forest belts or woods, especially in areas without buildings) and also protects them from potential Russian missile attacks. In fact, training takes place in these forests or in the nearby fields. At the moment, a part of the newly mobilized men are going into staffing the new infantry brigades being created (155th to 159th). Hopefully, however, these will be full-fledged units fighting consistently in a given sector (on the example of the 141st Infantry Brigade in Robotyne), unlike the 142/143/144th Infantry Brigades which battalions are scattered around the front and attached to other brigades short of infantry.\n\nAmong the brigades created in late 2023, the 151st Mechanized Brigade, according to what I found, has been brought into action, but in a piecemeal way. Its 1st Mech Battalion is in Kharkiv Oblast (likely covering the border); the 2nd Mech Battalion is committed near Ivanivske in the Chasiv Yar sector; the 3rd Mech Battalion is somewhere in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Elements of the 150th Mech Brigade are covering the border in Sumy Oblast; in Kharkiv Oblast the mobile fire group and the UAV unit of the 153rd Mech Brigade are active. The one furthest behind seems to be the 152nd Mech Brigade (which has received BWP-1s from Poland): I have not yet identified a deployment area for this unit at the front. The equipment and manpower problems of the past months had substantially slowed the process of creation of these brigades.\n\nAs far as I have found on Ukrainian social media, the tank battalion of the 154th Mech Brigade [has been equipped](https://i.imgur.com/OH6TbIR.png) with T-64BVs (like that of the 150th Brigade), which really do seem to be endless. Those you see in the photo in civilian clothes are members of the Odesa branch (where the brigade was raised) of the \u201cBatkivshchyna\u201d political party, who made a donation to this brigade. The tank battalion is deployed in Kherson Oblast. Other elements could be in Donetsk Oblast. Months ago the 154th Brigade [was seen](https://x.com/Militarylandnet/status/1772212245621039559) with a T-62M. I talked with an Ukrainian who explained to me that the T-62M actually belongs to a training center and is used for the phase of training where soldiers have to lie down as the tank passes over them.

                "body": "Now we will talk about Russian losses. Every Sunday the \u201cPoisk_in_UA\u201d Telegram channel publishes the weekly count of the identified Russian losses. I updated my [Excel graph](https://i.imgur.com/eDuDYxe.png) about them. \n\nhttps://t. me/poisk_in_ua/65608\n\nThe past week was the fifth highest since the beginning of the reports in January 2023; the previous week had been the highest ever. The week starting May 27 had \"few\" losses compared to the others, due to the lack of activity by the channel in the last days of the week - probably the backlog was then recovered in subsequent ones. Thus, the most important figure is the average. The KIAs recorded during 2024 on average (759) are 44% higher than the 2023 average (526). Over this year the war taken on a very bloody phase. The numbers are worse than the spikes in losses during the Donbas offensive in May/June 2022 or during the Bakhmut/Soledar campaign in January/February 2023, and unlike back them the losses are much more spread out along the front rather than in a specific sector (although the Pokrovsk sector continues to be the bloodiest). \n\nFor [Mediazona](https://en.zona.media/article/2022/05/20/casualties_eng), the estimate of fatalities in the first half of 2024 (almost 40 thousand!) is higher than any other semester of the war. The number of fatalities is estimated by them to be 200 to 250 per day, a number far higher than past estimates. As I had written in detail [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/1ckpo1n/comment/l2pklld/), I believe these numbers confirm my estimates that the Russians are having on average 250 to 350 KIAs + MIAs every day during 2024; the irretrievable losses during 2024 are probably 20,000 per month or even higher. The number of dead and missing (of people who fought for the Russian side in every rank - including convicts, men from D/LPR etc) is likely close to 170,000 now, in my educated guess. \n\nPersonally I am not a fan of the broader definition of casualties. Instead, I very much appreciate the one (of Soviet origin) of irretrievable losses, which are what actually counts (dead, missing, wounded permanently out of action, POWs). POWs are a very small part of the total losses in this war, for a variety of reasons. There has been a small increase in the number of new POWs compared to early 2024, although they remain well below the levels of May/June 2023 (the time of the Ukrainian counteroffensive in the southern flank of Bakhmut).\n\nThese findings are consistent with the estimates from Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence that have been seeing the Russian grouping in Ukraine growing by a few thousand men per month during 2024 (a pace well below that of 2023). When a new update on this is released I will take care to report it here. The point is that the net gain between new recruits and permanent losses in 2024 has been quite small.\n\nWe have now passed the halfway point of 2024 and only a fraction of the new Russian formations, which creation has been known since the beginning of the year, have actually been deployed to the front. This might suggest there are problems with both manpower and equipment. Russia's resources are still large though, and the coming months may see updates on this, but at the moment progress on this issue is worse than expected and things are looking worse than back in 2023. \n\nIn the summer of 2023 they managed to deploy the then new 25th CAA (Central Military District), created from scratch, just a few weeks after Ukrainian sources started reporting about its existence. The 70th Motorized Division and 144th Motorized Brigade of the then new 18th CAA (Southern MD) were also deployed to the front during summer 2023, and Ukrainian sources began talking about this new CAA when it had already been deployed to the front. In contrast, we have known about the Russian intention to form numerous new formations and units for 6/7 months now, but this seems to be going quite slowly. The Ukrainian observer Mashovets had reported at the beginning of the year that the Russians had moved the deadline for the creation of several new units from Feb. 29 to May 31, but only a portion of these have actually been deployed. \n\nAlso in 2023, they brought the 47th Tank Division of the 1st GTA (Moscow MD) to full strength (creating an additional motorized regiment as well as a tank one), introduced a third motorized regiment in the 3rd and 144th Motorized Divisions of the 20th CAA (Moscow MD), into the 20th Motorized Division of the 8th CAA (Southern MD) and a third airborne regiment into the 98th and 106th VDV Divisions, as well as reforming the 31st VDV Brigade into the 104th VDV Division. They also raised the 137th Motorized Brigade of the 41st CAA (Central MD). \n\nIn contrast, in 2024 progress seems considerably slower, at least unless there are substantial updates in the coming months. It was announced at the end of 2023 that the 155th Naval Infantry Brigade had become the 55th Naval Infantry Division, but this still finds no confirmation so long later. Russian sources continue to refer to it as the 155th Brigade and the organization is the same as before. A few months ago Shoigu had announced the reform of the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade into a division; there are no updates on this.\n\nThe new units and formations actually created and brought into action during 2024: the 44th Corps of the Leningrad MD (formed by the 72nd Motorized Division, 128th Motorized Brigade, and the various supporting units); the 21st Motorized Brigade of the 2nd CAA (Central MD) was reformed as the 27th Motorized Division (specifically, the 21st Brigade became its 433rd Motorized Regiment - the rest of the division, formed by the 506th and 589th Motorized Regiments as well as the support units, have been brought into battle by now). The 138th Motorized Brigade of the 6th CAA is being reformed into the 69th Motorized Division. The 138th Brigade has become its 82nd Motorized Regiment (on VK I found the division\u2019s [order of battle](https://i.imgur.com/dYB23Th.jpeg): two motorized regiments, a tank regiment + the support units), which is in action; the rest of the division should still be in the creation stage. There is no news on the new 68th Motorized Division, to be created as part of the Leningrad MD, nor on the new units to be created as part of the Moscow MD (I had mentioned them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/1aindfl/comment/kowvgzr/)). There has been no news on the 263rd Motorized Brigade, which was supposed to be deployed along the border in Belgorod Oblast. Some Russian channels have published recruitment ads for the 356th Motorized Brigade, apparently raised in Kursk, but there is no specific information about it. And there are still no updates about the reform of the 11th and 14th Corps of the Leningrad MD into CAAs.\n\nNo news either on the two new motorized brigades (89th and 94th) of the 5th CAA of the Eastern MD (yet creating brigades should be fairly easy for Russia, in theory). As for the Southern MD, there is no news on the 46th and 47th Motorized Divisions, which had been under creation in Crimea since last summer (!), nor on the 26th Motorized Brigade. There is no update on the plan to create an air assault brigade under each CAA (rather than subordinate to the VDV). In late 2023, the 49th Air Assault Brigade of the 58th CAA (Southern MD) had been created and deployed in the Kamyanske sector, but has disappeared from any radar ever since. The reserve rifle regiments subordinate to the CAAs that were created in early 2024 are march units, into which recruits from the training centers go, and from there they are assigned to the companies of the maneuver units most in need of reinforcement.",

The Ukrainian observer Mashovets had reported at the beginning of the year that the Russians had moved the deadline for the creation of several new units from Feb. 29 to May 31, but only a portion of these have actually been deployed. </p>\n\n<p>Also in 2023, they brought the 47th Tank Division of the 1st GTA (Moscow MD) to full strength (creating an additional motorized regiment as well as a tank one), introduced a third motorized regiment in the 3rd and 144th Motorized Divisions of the 20th CAA (Moscow MD), into the 20th Motorized Division of the 8th CAA (Southern MD) and a third airborne regiment into the 98th and 106th VDV Divisions, as well as reforming the 31st VDV Brigade into the 104th VDV Division. They also raised the 137th Motorized Brigade of the 41st CAA (Central MD). </p>\n\n<p>In contrast, in 2024 progress seems considerably slower, at least unless there are substantial updates in the coming months. It was announced at the end of 2023 that the 155th Naval Infantry Brigade had become the 55th Naval Infantry Division, but this still finds no confirmation so long later. Russian sources continue to refer to it as the 155th Brigade and the organization is the same as before. A few months ago Shoigu had announced the reform of the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade into a division; there are no updates on this.</p>\n\n<p>The new units and formations actually created and brought into action during 2024: the 44th Corps of the Leningrad MD (formed by the 72nd Motorized Division, 128th Motorized Brigade, and the various supporting units); the 21st Motorized Brigade of the 2nd CAA (Central MD) was reformed as the 27th Motorized Division (specifically, the 21st Brigade became its 433rd Motorized Regiment - the rest of the division, formed by the 506th and 589th Motorized Regiments as well as the support units, have been brought into battle by now). The 138th Motorized Brigade of the 6th CAA is being reformed into the 69th Motorized Division. The 138th Brigade has become its 82nd Motorized Regiment (on VK I found the division\u2019s <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/dYB23Th.jpeg\">order of battle</a>: two motorized regiments, a tank regiment + the support units), which is in action; the rest of the division should still be in the creation stage. There is no news on the new 68th Motorized Division, to be created as part of the Leningrad MD, nor on the new units to be created as part of the Moscow MD (I had mentioned them <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/1aindfl/comment/kowvgzr/\">here</a>). There has been no news on the 263rd Motorized Brigade, which was supposed to be deployed along the border in Belgorod Oblast. Some Russian channels have published recruitment ads for the 356th Motorized Brigade, apparently raised in Kursk, but there is no specific information about it. And there are still no updates about the reform of the 11th and 14th Corps of the Leningrad MD into CAAs.</p>\n\n<p>No news either on the two new motorized brigades (89th and 94th) of the 5th CAA of the Eastern MD (yet creating brigades should be fairly easy for Russia, in theory). As for the Southern MD, there is no news on the 46th and 47th Motorized Divisions, which had been under creation in Crimea since last summer (!), nor on the 26th Motorized Brigade. There is no update on the plan to create an air assault brigade under each CAA (rather than subordinate to the VDV). In late 2023, the 49th Air Assault Brigade of the 58th CAA (Southern MD) had been created and deployed in the Kamyanske sector, but has disappeared from any radar ever since. The reserve rifle regiments subordinate to the CAAs that were created in early 2024 are march units, into which recruits from the training centers go, and from there they are assigned to the companies of the maneuver units most in need of reinforcement.</p>\n</div>",

The reason why this place works is that it's a partisan sub of a relatively niche topic that also has a high bar for submission and heavy moderation. \n\nThis subreddit already self selects pretty heavily by not just requiring credible outlets for primary posts, but generally requires the sources also are in English (except for a few niche cases I might not be familiar with.) Comments must also be in English, which means that the potential user base is even smaller. This has resulted in a subreddit population that is not just \"western\", but American and occasionally British. The way war and military policy are viewed in those countries is very different from somewhere like China, India, Russia, or even France. \n\nFrom there, this place has a distinct political character with a window of acceptable thought by the users (I want to specify not the mods.) CredibleDefense generally has a fairly hawkish userbase that skews slightly liberal, although it definitely has a range of accepted political views and there are people who are more conservative and more liberal than the average user who get upvotes regularly. People that fall out of this window (for example, there are often people who post extremely pro-Russia comments that meet the threshold for acceptable comment quality by are heavily downvoted.) This keeps this place fairly agreeable for everyone and discourages people who have unpopular views from posting. It also means that the comment quality is much much higher than most other subreddits. If everyone in the world spoke English as a first language, this place would be much more unbearable. \n\nSo what is this all to say? Generally I think communities and forums with heavy moderation and have a limited (natural, self selected) window of acceptable thought generally generate better discussion than those which are extremely wide ranging. If most people agree on the core premise you are arguing in favor of, it allows for much more nuanced discussion because the disagreement isn't over how the topic is viewed entirely. \n\n(I really would like to thank the mods and user base for doing such a good job of making this community productive, healthy, and high quality.)",
