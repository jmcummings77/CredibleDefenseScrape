As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

Near transparency in all domains will significantly increase the lethality our forces will experience. China and Russia have studied our forces and doctrine and are fielding countermeasures. We will continue to have to fight outnumbered, exacerbated by a low MBT operational readiness rate and an aging fleet.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

However, this situation underscores the fact that Ukraine does not possess an unlimited supply of ammunition, much of which was provided by South Korea through the US. Furthermore, Ukraine does not have an inexhaustible pool of personnel in the already deployed brigades along the front lines.  </p>\n\n<p>Maintaining a healthy optimism is absolutely necessary as our troops make further progress. It&#39;s true that russian troops have suffered severe degradation, and counter-battery fire degraded their artillery capabilities. Their captured soldiers have testified about a lack of discipline and a diminishing will to fight. However, this optimism shouldn&#39;t transform into delusional hopefulness.  </p>\n\n<p>Earlier this spring, I cautioned against setting unrealistic expectations and the belief that russian defenses would collapse within weeks or days, leading to celebrations in liberated Crimea. I emphasized that a counter-offensive alone would not win this war and that we needed to plan for the long term. I hope that now, my message will resonate more strongly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

But if their consumption rate is limited for other reasons then ammunition consumption, then more PZH2000s might actually be a benefit.

IVAS, built around Microsoft\u2019s HoloLens augmented reality (AR) goggles, packs a lot of capability into a relatively compact set. IVAS includes a ruggedized heads-up display, cable, computer pack (known as the \u201cpuck\u201d, wearable battery, squad radio, and power charger.\n\n>Much like the heads-up display of a fighter jet, IVAS goggles project critical information into a soldier\u2019s field of view. Soldiers with IVAS can see the positions of others in their squad or platoon, designated pathways across the battlefield, enemy positions, and other data. They can also receive feeds from nearby night vision devices, including low-light and thermal sighting systems. Soldiers can \u201csee\u201d through the walls of the vehicles they are riding in by accessing cameras mounted on the vehicle\u2019s hull, or view the feed from drones flying over the battlefield. IVAS will even allow soldiers to properly identify enemy forces at a distance, using night vision, using Advanced Targeting & Lethality Aided System (ATLAS).\n\n>Furthermore, the Army is fielding the Enhanced Night Vision Goggle \u2013 Binocular (ENVG-B), a next-generation set of image intensification night vision goggles that not only provide stereoscopic night vision but can wirelessly connect to night vision sights mounted on weapons. A soldier with the ENVG-B package could, for example, raise a weapon over a wall, aim at a target, and open fire\u2014all without exposing him or herself to enemy fire.\n\n>IVAS is the most revolutionary tech to hit the infantry since night vision, and it\u2019s too bad that this game-changing tool has to battle it out with night vision for a place in the Army\u2019s budget.

There have also been comparisons made between this $22bn and the aid to Ukraine which has mostly consisted of decades old technology, and the need to fund more 'meat and potatoes' projects such as artillery ammo, etc., but without ever investing in the future, no one will ever know what tomorrow's meat and potatoes would be.

The attack late Thursday took place after the US Defense Department said an American F-16 jet shot down a Turkish drone that flew to within half a kilometer of US forces in Syria.\n\n>The unmanned aircraft was operated by Turkey\u2019s National Intelligence Agency, which was conducting cross-border operations in retaliation for a suicide-bomb in the Turkish capital on Sunday. The attack, which injured two security officers, was claimed by Kurdish militant group PKK and organized from Syria, according to Turkish intelligence.\n\n>The Turkish Foreign Ministry acknowledged that the armed drone belonged to Turkey in a written statement on Friday.

Nonetheless, Turkey\u2019s operations have stoked fresh tensions with Washington, which supports Kurdish forces who it says have played a major role in the US-led effort to defeat the Islamic State.\n\n>Ties between the two NATO allies have recently come under more strain, with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan delaying Sweden\u2019s entry to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n\n>\u201cAerial operations were aimed at eliminating the terrorist threat emanating from northern Syria,\u201d the Turkish Defense Ministry said.\n\n>The lira fell as much as 0.8% to a record low against the US dollar when markets opened Friday.

He affirmed a commitment to close coordination with Ankara to prevent any risk to US forces in Syria.\n\n>Turkey has since 2015 urged Washington to stop arming and training YPG militants. The US, for its part, has warned Turkey against unilateral airstrikes that could threaten American personnel.\n\n>Kurdish groups retain control over a large swathe of territory in Syria, which has been mired in a civil war since 2011.\n\n>Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s Damascus-based government has largely consolidated its rule elsewhere in the country with the help of Russia and Iran. On Thursday, rebel forces hit a military academy in the Assad-controlled city of Homs, killing over 100 people, according to U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Syria\u2019s state-media put the number of dead at 80.\n\n>Turkey views the YPG, thought to have tens of thousands of fighters, as a security threat due to its ties to the PKK \u2014 a separatist group that\u2019s deemed a terrorist organization by the US and European Union.\n\n>Turkey\u2019s broader conflict with Kurdish militants has killed tens of thousands of people since 1984.\n\n>Turkey\u2019s last major incursion into Syria took place in late 2019, with the stated aim of pushing armed groups away from the border.

They\u2019re building more modernized surface combatants to solely contest/control the SCS, ECS and Taiwan Strait, or because they want to create task groups that mimic American capabilities to project power in multiple oceans?\n\nI mean if you look at the  white paper the PLA put out a couple years ago, they basically want a military which is regional dominant by the early to mid 2030s, and one which is a full on superpower that can project globally in the 2040s.  Basically they are doing both, but establishing control over the SCC is currently much more of a priority then being able to project worldwide.   \n\n\nThat being said, to a certain extent increasing  projection and taking Taiwan do go hand in hand, because it allows the PLA to threaten hubs which U.S forces are going to need for the campaign.  For example, Guam (which is of major importance to the strategic bomber fleet) is already in range of the DF-26, with the hypersonic variant of that, the DF-27 in late stage testing.  In addition by the early 2030s the PLAN will probably have a couple Type 095s in service along with potentially the H20 stealth bomber, which will also be able to hit Guam and pose a serious threat to shipping.\n\nRAND actually recently recommended hardening hangars in Hawaii and Alaska, because it predicts that will be in tactical range of PLARF missiles by the mid 2030s.  \n\n>  Additionally you\u2019re ignoring developments like Rapid Dragon which will allow the USAF to flex its massive airlift capabilities into flying LRASM/JASSM boats\n\nI mean the issue is LRASM/JASSM production is pretty low, right now there are only a estimated 200 total, and only 40 being produced each year.  The CSIS wargames simulate 800-1200 being required to beat back the PLAN in 2028, when the reality is the US might not even have 500.  Also if the airfields at Guam or god forbid Hawaii get temporarily knocked out, literally every single bomber/transport will require at least 2 tankers, god knows what fighters would look like.  The U.S can obviously afford to do that, but probably not at the level needed to degrade the PLA IADS and establish air supremacy.  \n\nIf a carrier group wants to have F35s hit the chinese mainland with a proper combat load and without the need of 5 tankers, it will have to get into DF21/DF17 range and theres no real way of getting around that.",

In addition by the early 2030s the PLAN will probably have a couple Type 095s in service along with potentially the H20 stealth bomber, which will also be able to hit Guam and pose a serious threat to shipping.</p>\n\n<p>RAND actually recently recommended hardening hangars in Hawaii and Alaska, because it predicts that will be in tactical range of PLARF missiles by the mid 2030s.  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Additionally you\u2019re ignoring developments like Rapid Dragon which will allow the USAF to flex its massive airlift capabilities into flying LRASM/JASSM boats</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I mean the issue is LRASM/JASSM production is pretty low, right now there are only a estimated 200 total, and only 40 being produced each year.  The CSIS wargames simulate 800-1200 being required to beat back the PLAN in 2028, when the reality is the US might not even have 500.  Also if the airfields at Guam or god forbid Hawaii get temporarily knocked out, literally every single bomber/transport will require at least 2 tankers, god knows what fighters would look like.  The U.S can obviously afford to do that, but probably not at the level needed to degrade the PLA IADS and establish air supremacy.  </p>\n\n<p>If a carrier group wants to have F35s hit the chinese mainland with a proper combat load and without the need of 5 tankers, it will have to get into DF21/DF17 range and theres no real way of getting around that.</p>\n</div>",

It seems like you're arguing that at each point it should be approached as a tabula rasa, with no regard for it's history either recent or long past.\n\nIf you read my saying that Russia hasn't undergone the cultural changes to accept loss of empire that others have as saying that they never can make such a change (despite my explicitly saying otherwise), I think you're being reductive not engaging with what I'm saying in a fair minded way. You're bringing in these ideas of essentialism and predeterminism that are nowhere in my post. A discussion of history doesn't imply it must continue that way forever, just as a person who lied frequently may become honest, but  most people aren't going to rush to believe the words of a habitual liar until they've actually demonstrated a track record for honesty.\n\nNo point in further conversation if you're going to engage with what you imagined was written instead of what was.\n\nEdit: the policy prescription was in my first post that you responded to, btw. You might not agree with it as you seem to think Europe *didn't* try to make friends with post-Soviet Russia all the way through 2014, but that doesn't mean there isn't one.",
