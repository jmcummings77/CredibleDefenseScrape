        "body": "More from a previous [post](https://old.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/1c7v3tz/credibledefense_daily_megathread_april_19_2024/l0ca54l/) on the \u2018hybrid warfare\u2019 front, Bloomberg has a recent piece on the escalation of Russian operations across Europe:\n\n>  The hand of the GRU military intelligence service is likely behind a series of ever-more overt, frequent and coordinated incidents across the continent, according to officials familiar with the matter speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss open investigations.\n\n> From Berlin to Vilnius, governments are coming to grips with the growing threat from Russian-sponsored acts of sabotage and violent intimidation on NATO territory ahead of European Union elections next month that alongside a determined campaign of disinformation is designed to test the continent\u2019s support for Ukraine.\n\n> The sheer brazenness now of Kremlin-sanctioned activities \u2014 years after the Salisbury poisonings that the UK believe were likely ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Tiergarten killing in Berlin \u2014 has led one senior official to the conclusion that Moscow no longer cares if it\u2019s caught carrying out hostile acts and has jettisoned more subtle forms of clandestine espionage with open brutality on Western targets.\n\n>In London on Friday, a British man will appear in court, accused of carrying out an arson attack against a Ukrainian-linked warehouse in East London. The UK expelled a top Russian diplomat as part of a crackdown on Russian spies in response.\n\n> One European official said several of the incidents in Europe were part of a GRU-coordinated operation with similar activities being carried out in various capitals. The response is focused on activity that has happened as opposed to the threat of activity that could happen \u2013 and demonstrating to Russia that the West knows what it\u2019s doing and there are consequences, the official said.\n\n\n> It is highly likely that the strategy \u2014 aimed at Europe as a whole \u2014 has been signed off at the highest level in Moscow, one of the officials said. Russia has a deliberate strategy of sabotaging aid to Ukraine across Europe, recruiting locals to help their efforts, another official said.\n\n>Teija Tiilikainen, director of the European Center of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats, sees behind all this Russia\u2019s willingness to strengthen the role of authoritarian regime and is also possibly preparing itself for an escalation of its conflict with the West by testing its tools.\n\n> Estonia arrested earlier this year around a dozen individuals suspected of working for Russian intelligence and that were part of a wider low-cost plan to gain influence abroad, according to Margo Palloson, who leads its Internal Security Service. Lithuania\u2019s intelligence service warned this week that Russia is trying to employ residents in the Baltic states to carry out provocations or attacks.\n\n>\u201cThere\u2019s an increased use of social platforms for this, with ads searching for people to recruit, for people willing to spy for a fee, to photograph infrastructure of military objects of strategic importance, to collect data on individuals and to carry out acts of sabotage or vandalism,\u201d the agency said in a statement.\n\n> Officials at Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence service are concerned that Russian intelligence agencies are systematically targeting Russian-Germans living in the country via social media channels, a person familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity.\n\n> Romania\u2019s top defense council warned in a report about the potential infiltrations of Russian spies as Ukrainian refugees or even potential sabotages of military transport to Ukraine.\n\n> Romania is the EU member state that shares the longest border with Ukraine and has seen an increase in cyberattacks against some of its key institutions and politicians since the start of the war. During one of the attacks against the parliament\u2019s database, the hackers have stolen the ID details of Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu and posted it on the dark web, forcing him to change his ID.\n\nIn the U.K., these operations were purportedly staged from a 19^th century [castle](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/russia-hoped-to-use-19th-century-castle-as-its-spying-base-xptk7mp3v):\n\n> A Russian-owned castle on the Kent-Sussex border that had its diplomatic status removed this week is suspected of being used by Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency to meet and recruit UK agents.\n\n>Security sources said that Seacox Heath, a Grade II-listed 19th-century castle, had been targeted in the latest round of sanctions after being identified as a key base from which the GRU ran its British operations.\n\n>It is understood that the house has been monitored for years by the British intelligence agencies. Individuals believed to have been targeted as potential agents by the GRU, including British and other non-Russian members of criminal gangs, were seen entering and leaving the property.\n\n>Security sources said they believed the GRU was aiming to build a sophisticated spying base from Seacox Heath, near Ticehurst, East Sussex.

The UK expelled a top Russian diplomat as part of a crackdown on Russian spies in response.</p>\n\n<p>One European official said several of the incidents in Europe were part of a GRU-coordinated operation with similar activities being carried out in various capitals. The response is focused on activity that has happened as opposed to the threat of activity that could happen \u2013 and demonstrating to Russia that the West knows what it\u2019s doing and there are consequences, the official said.</p>\n\n<p>It is highly likely that the strategy \u2014 aimed at Europe as a whole \u2014 has been signed off at the highest level in Moscow, one of the officials said. Russia has a deliberate strategy of sabotaging aid to Ukraine across Europe, recruiting locals to help their efforts, another official said.</p>\n\n<p>Teija Tiilikainen, director of the European Center of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats, sees behind all this Russia\u2019s willingness to strengthen the role of authoritarian regime and is also possibly preparing itself for an escalation of its conflict with the West by testing its tools.</p>\n\n<p>Estonia arrested earlier this year around a dozen individuals suspected of working for Russian intelligence and that were part of a wider low-cost plan to gain influence abroad, according to Margo Palloson, who leads its Internal Security Service. Lithuania\u2019s intelligence service warned this week that Russia is trying to employ residents in the Baltic states to carry out provocations or attacks.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s an increased use of social platforms for this, with ads searching for people to recruit, for people willing to spy for a fee, to photograph infrastructure of military objects of strategic importance, to collect data on individuals and to carry out acts of sabotage or vandalism,\u201d the agency said in a statement.</p>\n\n<p>Officials at Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence service are concerned that Russian intelligence agencies are systematically targeting Russian-Germans living in the country via social media channels, a person familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity.</p>\n\n<p>Romania\u2019s top defense council warned in a report about the potential infiltrations of Russian spies as Ukrainian refugees or even potential sabotages of military transport to Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>Romania is the EU member state that shares the longest border with Ukraine and has seen an increase in cyberattacks against some of its key institutions and politicians since the start of the war. During one of the attacks against the parliament\u2019s database, the hackers have stolen the ID details of Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu and posted it on the dark web, forcing him to change his ID.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the U.K., these operations were purportedly staged from a 19<sup>th</sup> century <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/russia-hoped-to-use-19th-century-castle-as-its-spying-base-xptk7mp3v\">castle</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>A Russian-owned castle on the Kent-Sussex border that had its diplomatic status removed this week is suspected of being used by Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency to meet and recruit UK agents.</p>\n\n<p>Security sources said that Seacox Heath, a Grade II-listed 19th-century castle, had been targeted in the latest round of sanctions after being identified as a key base from which the GRU ran its British operations.</p>\n\n<p>It is understood that the house has been monitored for years by the British intelligence agencies. Individuals believed to have been targeted as potential agents by the GRU, including British and other non-Russian members of criminal gangs, were seen entering and leaving the property.</p>\n\n<p>Security sources said they believed the GRU was aiming to build a sophisticated spying base from Seacox Heath, near Ticehurst, East Sussex. It is understood to have been used as a base for a variety of intelligence-gathering methods.</p>\n\n<p>The Times understands that the authorities have been alarmed at the level of aggressive intelligence-gathering since the invasion of Ukraine.

        "body": "The case of the potential Kharkiv Offensive takes a turn for the weird.  In their first update about the offensive, deepstate estimated that the Russians advanced a bit south of the border village of Pylna, partially due to a small vehicle pileup they geolocated there.\n\nBut actually, that pileup occurred not south of Pylna, but still within Russian territory (and one of the vehicles was old, the rest apparently aren't).\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Deepstate_UA/status/1788944335737647166#m\n\nThat's not the really bizarre part though, no no.  I wouldn't bother making a comment just for that.\n\nDeepstate then clarifies that actually, **Russians have been in Pylna for some days now**:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Deepstate_UA/status/1788952015524987024#m\n\nAnd they appended copious photo evidence (that apparently only now has surfaced) of the same.

Minor elements of this brigade were involved in the battle of Bakhmut (there is material from Bakhmut from winter 2022/23 in their profiles); VABs are seen in several instances in videos posted in their accounts - officially they're in use by the 46th Airmobile Brigade and by the 79th Air Assault Brigade, but yesterday a video came out showing a convoy of Marder 1A3s, BMP-2s and VABs, which might indicate that a batch of them was received by the 25th Airborne Brigade. \n\nIf my geolocation is correct, the reportage was filmed in the first half of April, when the 9th Motorized Brigade of 1st Corps was attempting to enter the built-up area of Netailove, after having recently captured Pervomaiske (the conquered village mentioned in the video). In fact, since April the 25th Airborne Brigade has been turning its attention to Netailove as the 59th Motorized Brigade has been mostly focusing on Nevelske. Since then the Russians have occupied the positions shown in the video, arriving at the center of the settlement. The guys featuring in this reportage are doing fine luckily!",

Once the oil is refined, however, the final products can be sold internationally\u2014meaning that Russia must pay market price to meet its domestic and military fuel needs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Emphasis is mine.</p>\n\n<p>The question posed over the past couple of days was, &quot;why is Ukraine wasting ATACMS rockets on storage facilities?&quot; If we believe this article, the answer then would seem to be, Ukraine is specifically going after storage capacity of refined petroleum products to exaggerate the effects of their refinery strikes on both domestic and export dislocations in their economy. Whether or not this will be ultimately successful I don&#39;t know. The strikes only seem to destroy a smallish fraction of each tank farm, but if similar to airfields, they can deter the Russians from using them, then it becomes a logistical headache.</p>\n</div>",

In other words, the longterm trajectory of the conflict benefits Ukraine IMO. \n\nSo if Russia was going to try to overwhelm Ukrainian defenses, especially by trying to overstretch the already exhausted and depleted Ukrainian manpower, now would be the best possible time. Throwing 100,000 fresh conscripts, in addition to Russia's existing reserves, might be enough to create meaningful breakthroughs.

In reality, there is a massive budget of money spent and the two sides simply fight on what not to give the other side to appease a voter base.  It is like having a huge banana split you are sharing with your sibling and fighting over whether you should get 1/100th more chocolate or strawberry syrup and your parents saying \"just compromise and have 1/200th more of both\".\n\nWhen people are conditioned this way everything is framed as a zero-sum game, meaning you either give everything or nothing, if your enemy wins you lose, if you win they lose, and so on.  So in reality with the massiveness of the US tax budget America really just spends all its money on everything so funding something in Ukraine and on the border (a common one I've seen talked about) if it wasn't a political issue, they would fund both.\n\nSince this is the basis of how the American political system works at the moment, using propaganda around emotion works rather effectively.  It seems as of late most people assume if you are doing propaganda it is done by targeting the \"allied\" side.  So if Russia wants a certain policy they convince people to their cause (though when I've researched in the past Russia was more interested in division than specific pro/against policies) they target that audience with propaganda.  \n\nHowever, I am starting to see it being the other way around.  So let's say you want a certain amount of the population to pressure a vote against something, like say the border.  Then rather than creating pressure on \"independents\" or even on your right-leaning side, you instead target the left-leaning side with propaganda that evokes hate towards how the right is perceived to want border policy.  Because it is easier and more reliable to manipulate someone to hate something than to like something, the right will react to the left to take the opposite stance, now supporting your cause, but that is just the first step.\n\nNext, you must bring over independent people and they are swayed differently than a base, rather than trying to make your side seem reasonable (something echo chambers like to do) you want to make the opposite side look crazy.  So you will force the left side to run stories to defend the position you made them take from an indefensible position, so rather than making someone believe your way of thinking (ex pro border) you are simply pushing them away whatever it is the left thinks (eg border).\n\nI'm not sure if I am typing this out in a way that makes sense, but we are in a post Rules For Radicals world and rather than getting your base up in a frenzy to help you force the other side to the table to make concessions, I think the way media consumption has changed to rather than you manipulating your side it is more advantageous to manipulate the opposing side to look as deranged as possible to make your position seem more reasonable.\n\nSo the elite left manipulates and targets the far right and the elite right manipulates and targets the far left with propaganda.  All that is left is to take any moderate right/left position and paint it as inline with the crazy far right/left people you manipulate (defining your enemy by their radicals which you now control).",

Not completely, of course, but the Geneva Convention has clauses stating that if the enemy does something to invalidate a target- like, say, using a hospital as a military base- then that particular target is fair game to hit.\n\nThat's what I was getting at when I mentioned the \"you have to respect the obligations yourself\" bit.

                "body": "Israel has constant high end drone surveillance over the battlefield but I think it's really the lack of Hamas air defenses that makes cheap drone proliferation unnessecary not that cheap drones are only a feature on a low-tech battlefield. Any side trying to fly million dollar drones to be the primary front surveillance platform or strike platform in Ukraine would have that drone shot down by very capable air defenses (particularly the Russian AD but also Ukrainan AD prior to exhaustion) much faster than they could produce them. They can do a lot of reconnaissance from farther back but direct over-flight or loitering for long periods over the battlefield like Israel can do is very risky with million dollar drones. You can build FPV drones much faster than any country can produce air defense missile and really jamming is the only option.

                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Israel has constant high end drone surveillance over the battlefield but I think it&#39;s really the lack of Hamas air defenses that makes cheap drone proliferation unnessecary not that cheap drones are only a feature on a low-tech battlefield. Any side trying to fly million dollar drones to be the primary front surveillance platform or strike platform in Ukraine would have that drone shot down by very capable air defenses (particularly the Russian AD but also Ukrainan AD prior to exhaustion) much faster than they could produce them. They can do a lot of reconnaissance from farther back but direct over-flight or loitering for long periods over the battlefield like Israel can do is very risky with million dollar drones. You can build FPV drones much faster than any country can produce air defense missile and really jamming is the only option.

A general sentiment from that day was that the first days - weeks (and even some mention of **hours** for specific munitions IIRC) would be an incredible display of superiority, but then we're essentially out of munitions. \n\nThe comment from ferrel_hadley reads like fantasy to me and i'd urge people not to huff the hopium, else there wouldn't be such a step change in NATO countries having to actually prepare their nations for a protracted war. \n\nGranted from April 2022, but this still seems to be Justin Bronk's thoughts:\n\n[NATO is Dangerously Dependent on the US for SEAD/DEAD](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/rusi-defence-systems/getting-serious-about-sead-european-air-forces-must-learn-failure-russian-air-force-over-ukraine)\n\nAlso:\n\n\n**[Europe Must Urgently Prepare to Deter Russia Without Large-Scale US Support](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/europe-must-urgently-prepare-deter-russia-without-large-scale-us-support)**\n> European air forces, in particular, must also rapidly procure specialised weapons and dedicate serious aircrew training time and focus to developing high-end suppression and destruction of enemy air defences (SEAD/DEAD) capabilities. Currently these reside almost exclusively among US air arms. \n\n>**...** \n\n>To avoid being extremely vulnerable when or if US rapid reinforcement is unlikely, European air forces must be able to collectively destroy the Russian SAM systems that currently would make air superiority over contested Alliance territory impossible to achieve without a major US SEAD/DEAD campaign.\n\nAlso worth the read is: [Regenerating Warfighting Credibility for European NATO Air Forces](https://static.rusi.org/whr_regenerating-warfighting-credibility-nato_0.pdf).

A general sentiment from that day was that the first days - weeks (and even some mention of <strong>hours</strong> for specific munitions IIRC) would be an incredible display of superiority, but then we&#39;re essentially out of munitions. </p>\n\n<p>The comment from ferrel_hadley reads like fantasy to me and i&#39;d urge people not to huff the hopium, else there wouldn&#39;t be such a step change in NATO countries having to actually prepare their nations for a protracted war. </p>\n\n<p>Granted from April 2022, but this still seems to be Justin Bronk&#39;s thoughts:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/rusi-defence-systems/getting-serious-about-sead-european-air-forces-must-learn-failure-russian-air-force-over-ukraine\">NATO is Dangerously Dependent on the US for SEAD/DEAD</a></p>\n\n<p>Also:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/europe-must-urgently-prepare-deter-russia-without-large-scale-us-support\">Europe Must Urgently Prepare to Deter Russia Without Large-Scale US Support</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>European air forces, in particular, must also rapidly procure specialised weapons and dedicate serious aircrew training time and focus to developing high-end suppression and destruction of enemy air defences (SEAD/DEAD) capabilities. Currently these reside almost exclusively among US air arms. </p>\n\n<p><strong>...</strong> </p>\n\n<p>To avoid being extremely vulnerable when or if US rapid reinforcement is unlikely, European air forces must be able to collectively destroy the Russian SAM systems that currently would make air superiority over contested Alliance territory impossible to achieve without a major US SEAD/DEAD campaign.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Also worth the read is: <a href=\"https://static.rusi.org/whr_regenerating-warfighting-credibility-nato_0.pdf\">Regenerating Warfighting Credibility for European NATO Air Forces</a>.
