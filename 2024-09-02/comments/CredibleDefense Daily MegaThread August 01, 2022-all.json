That created a much weakened NCO corps where those with clout in their unit were the Grandfathers, those serving the last six months of their two year hitch. Because officers didn't live in the barracks with the men, and because that empowered the Grandfathers to help their weak NCOs with discipline, it created a perfect environment for the hazing tradition to start, which was bad but not horrible until after the collapse of the Soviet Union when discipline, pay, morale, and purpose eroded too.

A new form of hazing started, not as bad, where the long serving contract troops sometimes extorted or hazed the conscripts in their unit (though many conscripts on Reddit say the contract troops just ignored them).

And when they're done, they're discharged.\n\nI am not saying hazing won't return, take the military and add young men and there will be hazing, but this war broke the cycle for the existing culture.

Russia has taken enough already to spin a limited victory, and it will sell at least well enough to not threaten the regime. Putin's regime does not appear to be in question. However, the military would be the perfect political actor to dispel the myth of a victory and challenge Putin. Anti-war voices are non-factors in Russian politics, and the chances of a popular uprising are slim. An independent, non-loyalist military, however, would have all the legitimacy required to push back on Kremlin propaganda and reframe the war as a mistake.\n\nReally outside of a complete military collapse, military defeat probably doesn't threaten Putin all that much. This is a long-term strategic blunder, not an immediate, existential defeat.\n\n>Also I have no idea where the false notion that dictators want an incompetent military comes from. This is false, dictators don't intentionally make their military worse, it's simply a byproduct of promoting corrupt yes-men instead of based on merit. Regardless of the military being competent or not, it has more than enough military power to overthrow a dictator, since he can't outshoot them.\n\nOkay, so you just outlined why the military is staffed by cronies out of political necessity. Of course the military has the capability of overthrowing Putin, or any other authoritarian regime. That's why the military is staffed with loyalists, and why corruption is tolerated as a means of ensuring loyalty. That underlying political necessity is unchanged, and holds precedence over long-term military efficacy.\n\n>The competence of the military has nothing to do with its political influence. If anything it is often inversely correlated. In fact, siloviki already have the strongest influence around Putin and could remove him if they wanted to.

The last thing he wants is a military defeat because it will destroy him politically.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Doubt it. Russia has taken enough already to spin a limited victory, and it will sell at least well enough to not threaten the regime. Putin&#39;s regime does not appear to be in question. However, the military would be the perfect political actor to dispel the myth of a victory and challenge Putin. Anti-war voices are non-factors in Russian politics, and the chances of a popular uprising are slim. An independent, non-loyalist military, however, would have all the legitimacy required to push back on Kremlin propaganda and reframe the war as a mistake.</p>\n\n<p>Really outside of a complete military collapse, military defeat probably doesn&#39;t threaten Putin all that much. This is a long-term strategic blunder, not an immediate, existential defeat.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Also I have no idea where the false notion that dictators want an incompetent military comes from. This is false, dictators don&#39;t intentionally make their military worse, it&#39;s simply a byproduct of promoting corrupt yes-men instead of based on merit. Regardless of the military being competent or not, it has more than enough military power to overthrow a dictator, since he can&#39;t outshoot them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Okay, so you just outlined why the military is staffed by cronies out of political necessity. Of course the military has the capability of overthrowing Putin, or any other authoritarian regime. That&#39;s why the military is staffed with loyalists, and why corruption is tolerated as a means of ensuring loyalty. That underlying political necessity is unchanged, and holds precedence over long-term military efficacy.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The competence of the military has nothing to do with its political influence. If anything it is often inversely correlated. In fact, siloviki already have the strongest influence around Putin and could remove him if they wanted to. But there is no reason to, it&#39;s more advantageous to stay loyal for now. The military defeat will change that equation which is why Putin can&#39;t allow it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A competent military is necessarily removed from political loyalism.

Satellite imagery shared exclusively with NPR shows a possible new tunnel being dug and fresh roads added at the site, known as Lop Nur, where China has tested its nuclear weapons in the past.\n\n\"This is new construction linked to areas that have in the past supported nuclear test activities,\" says Renny Babiarz, vice president for analysis and operations at AllSource Analysis, a private geospatial analysis firm that spotted the tunnel using satellite imagery from the commercial company Planet.\n\nBut Babiarz adds that it remains far from clear what the tunnel will be used for. China has not conducted full-scale nuclear testing since the 1990s, when it and the world's other major nuclear powers entered into a voluntary moratorium on testing. The Chinese government, and other nations including the U.S., have continued to test the nonnuclear components of nuclear weapons \u2014 sometimes underground.\n\nTwo new nuclear missile fields were discovered in other parts of China\nIn an email, Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., declined to comment on the site itself, but he said that China \"stays committed to the nuclear testing moratorium.\" He also objected to \"unacceptable U.S. allegations\" that the Chinese government was in any way trying to undermine the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, an unratified treaty that remains the basis for the global pause to nuclear testing.\n\nThe news of the new tunnel comes after two separate groups turned up giant nuclear missile fields under construction in other parts of the country earlier in the month.\n\n\"Over the past year and a half, China has constructed at least two large facilities, each with more than 100 missile silos,\" says Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, who's team found the first field. \"China had 18 silos prior to this.\"\n\nChina's nuclear force can't compare to America's\nLewis notes that even with the newly discovered missile silos, China's nuclear force remains far smaller than America's. \"We're getting worked up over 200 silos, which is something,\" he says. \"But the United States has more than 400.\" The U.S. also has bombers and submarines capable of delivering a nuclear strike.\n\nStill, the growth in China's nuclear arsenal may mark a departure from the nation's traditional attitude toward nuclear weapons. For decades, while the U.S. and Russia stockpiled many thousands of weapons, China maintained a so-called minimum deterrent of a few hundred warheads.\n\n\"It was never important for them to engage in the kind of arms race that you saw between the United States and the Soviet Union,\" says Lewis.\n\nBut China might be trying to change that\n\"When you look at their numbers juxtaposed against ours, it's a pretty significant difference,\" says Robert P. Ashley Jr., an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security and former head of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency. He says he thinks China is now growing its nuclear arsenal as part of a much larger push to become a dominant global power. \"Part of their strategy is to try to build out those numbers,\" he says.\n\nTong Zhao, a researcher at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace based in Beijing, says he also sees evidence that China is starting to move away from that traditional view of nuclear weapons. \"Increasingly, people are saying that a bigger arsenal will provide China with geopolitical benefit; it will make American decision-makers think twice,\" Zhao says.\n\nHe believes that China will continue to add silos, road-mobile missiles, submarines and bombers in the coming years.\n\n\"My guess is that this new nuclear buildup really receives support from the highest level,\" Zhao says. Though, he notes, China's nuclear policy is shrouded in secrecy.\n\nChina has traditionally maintained a much smaller nuclear arsenal than the U.S. or Russia. The latest buildup has led some to think that might be changing.\n\nThe facilities at the test site in Lop Nur are likely tied to that larger expansion. Zhao notes that many experts think \"China's smallest nuclear warhead design is still heavier than the American equivalent.\" He believes the nation may be trying to further shrink the size of its nukes so that missiles can carry more warheads on top. Testing at Lop Nur, even at a small scale, could aid in that development. It's also possible that China is conducting work to simply maintain its existing, aging arsenal of weapons.\n\nBased in part on the relatively small size of the mountains where the tunnel is being dug, Lewis thinks the new tunnel will support smaller tests. \"I am someone who thinks that it is probably what are called 'subcritical' nuclear tests, which the United States also does underground at our nuclear test site in Nevada,\" he says.\n\nWithout access to the site, it's hard to tell what exactly is going on\nSuch testing often involves only the nonnuclear components of a weapon. But earlier this year, a State Department report expressed concern that China may be conducting very small-scale tests using nuclear material at Lop Nur. Such tests would not trigger a full-scale detonation, but they would run counter to a voluntary \"zero yield\" standard adhered to by the U.S., U.K. and France. Chinese Embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu rejected such allegations as \"irresponsible.\"\n\nFiguring out exactly what's going on at a remote site like Lop Nur is nearly impossible without on-the-ground access of the sort that sometimes comes with arms control agreements. The U.S. and China currently do not have any nuclear arms control pacts and \"because we don't have that kind of dialogue, we're just guessing,\" Lewis says.\n\nLewis says arms control negotiations have gone nowhere, in part because the U.S. has failed to take seriously China's concerns about things such as missile defense. Zhao says that appetite for negotiations within the Chinese government is also low. \"There is deep and longstanding suspicion within the Chinese expert community about arms control,\" he says.\n\nUltimately, Zhao says, he believes China's nuclear forces are going to keep growing in coming years. \"We are just seeing the early signs of a nuclear race,\" he says. \"Much more awaits us.\"",

        "body": "I'm wondering about this counter-offensive in Kherson the Russians are supposed to be building up (30 BTGs is one number I've read today). Pouring men and material into northern Kherson sounds stupid, with Ukraine blowing the bridges to pieces behind them. And even they should be aware that there's not the chance of a snowflake in hell for them to take Mykolaiv, much less Odessa. So... why?\n\nThe only logical explanation I managed to come up with (besides Putin giving out some sort of stupid F\u00fchrerbefehl) is that neither Mykolaiv nor Odessa is their true strategic goal, but rather Ukraine's army.\n\nUkraine will only stop fighting and go to the negotiation table when its army is depleted and not able to fight anymore, so much is clear. So Russia somehow has to do facilitate that. Just going onto the defensive probably won't help, they might get the same results, but they'll lose occupied territory. So they use northern Kherson as a battlefield to diminish the Ukrainian army.\n\nFour possible outcomes:\n\n1. They are successful in their counter-offensive and even gain some territory, smashing Ukraine's offensive potential - great for them\n2. The two armies pretty much manage to wipe each other's offensive potentials out, without much territorial changes - great again, Russia already is in possession of sufficient territorial gains to conclude the war at the negotiation table and frame it as a victory\n3. They lose their army, and Ukraine gets back Kherson, but their army is spent afterwards - not really that great, but again - they still are in possession of sufficient territorial gains (land-corridor to Crimea, all of Luhansk, much of Donetsk) to conclude the war at the negotiation table and frame it as a victory\n4. They get smashed, lose Kherson and Ukraine is still able to roll on. Well, that would be a worst-case for Russia. But will it happen?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think?",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m wondering about this counter-offensive in Kherson the Russians are supposed to be building up (30 BTGs is one number I&#39;ve read today). Pouring men and material into northern Kherson sounds stupid, with Ukraine blowing the bridges to pieces behind them. And even they should be aware that there&#39;s not the chance of a snowflake in hell for them to take Mykolaiv, much less Odessa. So... why?</p>\n\n<p>The only logical explanation I managed to come up with (besides Putin giving out some sort of stupid F\u00fchrerbefehl) is that neither Mykolaiv nor Odessa is their true strategic goal, but rather Ukraine&#39;s army.</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine will only stop fighting and go to the negotiation table when its army is depleted and not able to fight anymore, so much is clear. So Russia somehow has to do facilitate that. Just going onto the defensive probably won&#39;t help, they might get the same results, but they&#39;ll lose occupied territory.

Obviously, the numbers fluctuate day by day, so there&#39;s going to be a fairly large percent of error.</p>\n\n<p>You can see the total number of 155mm shells delivered in this list: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_foreign_aid_to_Ukraine_during_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_foreign_aid_to_Ukraine_during_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War</a>. I counted up to 296,500 publicly announced but there are definitely more unannounced.</p>\n\n<p>Judging at least by this anecdotal evidence, we can conclude that the West has been sending just enough rounds for Ukraine to not run out, but not enough to be on par with Russian arty spam.

This is backed up by the fact that Russians are starting to make progress in the Donbas again using massive artillery shelling against heavily fortified positions. \n\nThe issue is force concentrations, the Russians packed the Donbas with BTGs, each of which has its own battalion of tube and rocket artillery, plus they have independent artillery brigades. Because of the relatively small size of the whole operational area, the fact that the Ukrainians are inside a salient, it means the UAF are subject to lots more overlapping fields of fire, the Russians will naturally surround every angle of the salient. At that point it's just a matter of massing fires and attacks against specific areas, made easier because those areas being hit never move unless a UAF retreat is authorized or they're pushed out. In addition, Russian supply lines are the shortest in the Donbas region and most secure in the whole theater (or where), they have localized air superiority, they're able to jam most UAF drones, and their own drones have extensive coverage.\n\nBut that isn't the same everywhere, just the Donbas, because that's where the Russian strategic main effort is located. In other areas the UAF might actually have force superiority. If the Ukrainians expect to hold the Donbas they have to address the issues that allow Russians to successfully advance (listed above). However, the issues in other sectors are much different.\n\nFor instance, the areas where UAF counteroffensives are poised are filled with Russian defensive lines that they've spent months building, often situated on river obstacles. Because UAF tactical capabilities have been greatly diminished due to heavy losses in the last six months, they'll need to figure out another way, similar to the Russians in the Donbas, to ensure victory without relying on quality ground troops to do the hard work. That can and likely means also relying on fires centric approach but with more access to PGMs, continuous interdiction of rear area supplies, targeting of command and control, use of partisan assistance in rear areas for intel and attacks, propaganda, etc. \n\nThe whole point of the UAF disabling the Dnieper River bridges is to try to win a battle without even fighting one. If it works and the Russians evacuate the region because they're afraid of the losses they'll take without resupply, that means the Ukrainians can win an operational victory without a grinding battle, without a fires advantage. Sure, it might not work either, but performing stratagems like that to outwit the Russians can act as a major force multiplier.",

I really wouldn't predict with confidence either way, but I do think that the US would still want to avoid WW3, and any nuclear escalation.\n\nHitting airbases is something which is phenomenally embarrassing to the Chinese, illustrates American ability to strike within China - but also has the potential for a route out of all-out war. I don't think it would satisfy the US on its own, but if that's the only kinetic response, and otherwise retaliation is cyber or economic warfare, then WW3 doesn't have to happen.\n\nIf the Chinese navy is sunk (and it's questionable whether the US could even achieve that), then that's already war. China will immediately have to strike back with as much non-nuclear ordnance as it can - because being choked off navally is an existential threat for China.

I really wouldn&#39;t predict with confidence either way, but I do think that the US would still want to avoid WW3, and any nuclear escalation.</p>\n\n<p>Hitting airbases is something which is phenomenally embarrassing to the Chinese, illustrates American ability to strike within China - but also has the potential for a route out of all-out war. I don&#39;t think it would satisfy the US on its own, but if that&#39;s the only kinetic response, and otherwise retaliation is cyber or economic warfare, then WW3 doesn&#39;t have to happen.</p>\n\n<p>If the Chinese navy is sunk (and it&#39;s questionable whether the US could even achieve that), then that&#39;s already war. China will immediately have to strike back with as much non-nuclear ordnance as it can - because being choked off navally is an existential threat for China.

Here goes:\n\n>Under international law, an entity is potentially a state if it has a permanent population, a defined territory, a government, and a capacity to enter into relations with other states. Taiwan meets most of these criteria, although has a very limited capacity to deal with other states precisely because most states do not regard it as a state or have diplomatic relations with it. The fact that Taiwan has not categorically declared statehood or rejected a negotiated \u201cOne China\u201d solution, and that almost the whole international community does not view it as a state, are totally fatal to its statehood.\n\nI think you kind of misunderstand the Montevideo criteria. For an entity to be a state it needs to have the *capacity* to enter into relations with other states. Whether other states wish to engage in those relations doesn't factor in. Indeed, the entire point of that criterion is to make statehood independent of the politics of other entities.\n\nThen I am not sure what you mean by ROC explicitly declaring statehood. ROC has been a sovereign state since the 1920's. I am not aware of any other country that has a policy of periodically declaring it's statehood.\n\n>This is where the rules on war come in. The conventional legal answer totally favours China. Only a state has the right to use military force in self-defence against an armed attack by another state \u2013 and to ask other states to help it to defend itself.

The US backed Taiwan even when it was a military dictatorship until the 1990s; its defence has never really been about freedom.\n\nYou are indeed correct that the UN charter only explicitly permits self defense for member states of the United Nations, but then I am not sure why you think that means non-member states does not have that right. AFAIK, that is nowhere stated in the charter, but even if it was why would Taiwan be bound by the treaty, when they aren't a member? In any case it is an *absurd* expectation to put on someone, that they should stand by and do nothing when they are getting attacked.\n\nOn the other hand, (assuming Taiwan/ROC is a state, albeit not a UN-member), the UN-charter does explicitly prohibit PRC from attacking. As per article 2(4).\n\n>\\> \"All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.\"\n\nNotice, how the article (unlike 51) makes no reference to whether the state is a UN-member or not, for it to be protected from the use of force. To me, it seems like you technically have it the wrong way; While PRC can not legally use military force against ROC, the ROC (as a non-member) could hypothetically decide to attack the PRC legally. They won't though, so it's a moot point.\n\nAs for alliances and collective self-defense, the issues become even more complicated. Again, collective self-defense is only explicitly permitted between UN-member states. But what makes you think it is somehow forbidden for non-member states? If PRC is the one attacking, and another country steps in to support Taiwan, I would still argue that PRC is the one in breach of the charter.\n\nOn the last point we agree. Political systems or concepts such as *freedom,* are irrelavant to the international law aspect.\n\n>Further, every state has a sovereign right to maintain authority over its own territory and people, including by forcibly suppressing separatism. If Taiwan is Chinese territory, China has a right to take it back and restore Chinese sovereignty \u2013 just as the US did in its own civil war.

Current US arms sales to Taiwan would also be illegal force and prohibited intervention against China \u2013 just like Russia funnelling weapons to separatists in Ukraine.\n\nOkay, I get what you are saying, but a lot of your arguments are sort of besides the discussion. You use formulations such as \"seperatism\", \"take back\" or \"restore\". There is nothing to take back. There is nothing to restore. Taiwan has never been part of PRC. The question of ROC seperatism from the PRC is absurd, since the ROC predates it. Another question often asked; whether Taiwan should formally seperate *from the ROC*, is similar but different, and that has not yet happened. PS: I am not traying to say that your comment is absurd, just that it is unclear.\n\nI guess you could take the position that ROC and PRC *technically* still are different sides in an ongoing civil war, which would make any dealing with any sides, *technically* intervening in internal affairs. Then the US weapon sales would be interfering in ROC's affair as much as PRC's affairs.\n\nFor the record I also want to say that I disagree with your assertion that \" every state has a sovereign right to maintain authority over its own territory and people, including by forcibly suppressing separatism.\" The authority comes from the people not the other way around, but that isn't really part of our discussion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo to sum up, most of our disagreements boil down:\n\n1. Is Taiwan a state?\n2. Is Taiwan, and Mainland China seperate and independent from eachother?\n\nI don't think the two of us will reach on a consensus on either question, but I have tried to engage your individual points, as much as I can, while staying neutral (as in not introducing new premises).\n\nCheers",

            "body": "Russia has absorbed similar economic shocks before, and the last twenty-five years have shown that its economy can endure serious pain without destabilizing its political foundations. To put the stress in perspective, the estimated 4.5 percent contraction of Russia\u2019s GDP in the three months since the invasion is similar to the early losses during the 2008 global financial crisis and the country\u2019s 1998 financial crisis. And it pales in comparison to the shock from the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.\n\nIn the long run though, Economic Autarky is Russia\u2019s only option at this point. There are alternative sources beyond the EU/US to tap into markets, technology and capital, including in China. But the breadth of the sanctions is such that even Chinese entities if they themselves plan to do business or raise money in the EU/US, will avoid doing business with Russia. U.S. sanctions are notoriously difficult to overturn.\n\nAs a result, Russian industry will be left to grow, if it can, by having to depend on only domestic resources. It is quite unlikely to believe that the current impasse in which Russia finds itself can be overcome through different policies. That could have been achieved several years ago, but is no longer an option. Luckily for them, Russia is one of the few countries in the world that can truly engage in autarky.\n\nThe causes listed in the imposition of sanctions are manifold, they cover the whole range of Russian policy approaches. They are so comprehensive that no new post-Putin government of any conceivable kind can accept reversing course on them all in order to shed the sanctions. The required fundamental change of behavior can be accepted only by a totally and utterly defeated country.\n\nNow, it is often wrongly asserted that the USSR actively chose a policy of economic autarky back in the 1920s. That is not the case. Russia spent the entire 1920s in pursuit of foreign capital which it wanted to use to rebuild its destroyed industry and, optimistically, catch up with Europe. But that capital was never forthcoming. And since the Soviets had repudiated the debt accumulated by Tsarist Russia, their access to capital markets was shut. This created the situation in which Soviet development had to be conducted entirely based on domestic accumulation and technology. That is how comprehensive planning of the economy turned into a national economic strategy.\n\nIn contrast to the 1920s, there is no ideology, short of extreme nationalism, on which an autarkic system can be built today. The Bolsheviks of the 1920s had an ideology which led them ultimately to accept autarky and to work within its constraints. Such an ideology does not exist in today\u2019s Russia.",
            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Russia has absorbed similar economic shocks before, and the last twenty-five years have shown that its economy can endure serious pain without destabilizing its political foundations. To put the stress in perspective, the estimated 4.5 percent contraction of Russia\u2019s GDP in the three months since the invasion is similar to the early losses during the 2008 global financial crisis and the country\u2019s 1998 financial crisis. And it pales in comparison to the shock from the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.</p>\n\n<p>In the long run though, Economic Autarky is Russia\u2019s only option at this point. There are alternative sources beyond the EU/US to tap into markets, technology and capital, including in China. But the breadth of the sanctions is such that even Chinese entities if they themselves plan to do business or raise money in the EU/US, will avoid doing business with Russia. U.S. sanctions are notoriously difficult to overturn.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, Russian industry will be left to grow, if it can, by having to depend on only domestic resources. It is quite unlikely to believe that the current impasse in which Russia finds itself can be overcome through different policies. That could have been achieved several years ago, but is no longer an option. Luckily for them, Russia is one of the few countries in the world that can truly engage in autarky.</p>\n\n<p>The causes listed in the imposition of sanctions are manifold, they cover the whole range of Russian policy approaches. They are so comprehensive that no new post-Putin government of any conceivable kind can accept reversing course on them all in order to shed the sanctions. The required fundamental change of behavior can be accepted only by a totally and utterly defeated country.</p>\n\n<p>Now, it is often wrongly asserted that the USSR actively chose a policy of economic autarky back in the 1920s. That is not the case. Russia spent the entire 1920s in pursuit of foreign capital which it wanted to use to rebuild its destroyed industry and, optimistically, catch up with Europe. But that capital was never forthcoming. And since the Soviets had repudiated the debt accumulated by Tsarist Russia, their access to capital markets was shut. This created the situation in which Soviet development had to be conducted entirely based on domestic accumulation and technology. That is how comprehensive planning of the economy turned into a national economic strategy.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast to the 1920s, there is no ideology, short of extreme nationalism, on which an autarkic system can be built today. The Bolsheviks of the 1920s had an ideology which led them ultimately to accept autarky and to work within its constraints. Such an ideology does not exist in today\u2019s Russia.</p>\n</div>",
