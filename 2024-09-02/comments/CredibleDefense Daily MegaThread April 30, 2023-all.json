There was a LOT of media buzz tonight, probably set off by the explosion in Pavlohrad, which happened just about as the Tu-95s were taking off from their bases.</p>\n\n<p>Tu-95 takeoffs start: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/olga_pp98/status/1652746975735840769?s=20\">https://twitter.com/olga_pp98/status/1652746975735840769?s=20</a></p>\n\n<p>Pavlohrad explosion:\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/IntelCrab/status/1652759129256075268?s=20\">https://twitter.com/IntelCrab/status/1652759129256075268?s=20</a></p>\n\n<p>4 hours later, Tu-95 first launches, and note the missiles take 2+ hours to reach targets:\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/olga_pp98/status/1652820309831974914?s=20\">https://twitter.com/olga_pp98/status/1652820309831974914?s=20</a></p>\n\n<p>While Ukraine&#39;s AD is degraded, the same can be said of Russia&#39;s long-range fires.</p>\n\n<p>Now to wait for the BDA of the massive explosion in Pavlohrad.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "[Pawn shops and bread queues: poverty grips Ukraine as war drags on](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/30/ukraine-war-poverty-irpin-pawn-shops-bread-queues)\n\n>People turn to handouts and pawning goods as Kyiv\u2019s bustling bars belie reality of life in wartime for many  \n>  \n>In the Treasure pawn shop in Kyiv, Oleksandra, 40, a well turned out woman in a hooded wool coat and Nike trainers, has come to redeem her sewing machines. Like all those visiting the store, she does not want to give her family name.She says that when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, she was working as an accountant for a firm that employed 14 people, who were all laid off because of the conflict. Since then she has struggled to find regular work. With savings running out, like many others in Kyiv, she turned to pawning her possessions to get by, only finding a job a year later that allowed her to claim back her machines.As Oleksandra leaves clutching her belongings, save for a mobile phone she has decided not to redeem, the cashier, Oleksandr Stepanov, remarks from behind his hardened glass window that on a busy day the shop can get 50 people coming in to surrender mobile phones and household appliances.Those who can afford it, he says, will come back to get their goods within two weeks. Almost half, he adds, will not, leaving Treasure to sell on the items from a back room with displays of phones and watches. \u201cPeople are struggling because of the war. They don\u2019t have money.\u201d Many have lost their jobs, he says, while prices have skyrocketed even for those who have jobs.The scene in the pawn shop illustrates the crisis of growing poverty in Ukraine, the reality of which stands in contrast to the surface bustle of Kyiv\u2019s busy restaurants and bars where it is often hard to get a table, with many living a precarious existence.Poverty increased from 5.5% to 24.2% in Ukraine in 2022, pushing 7.1 million more people into poverty with the worst impact out of sight in rural villages, according to a recent report by the World Bank. With unemployment unofficially at 36% and inflation hitting 26.6% at the end of 2022, the institution\u2019s regional country director for eastern Europe, Arup Banerji, had warned that poverty could soar.Behind his window in Treasure, Stepanov describes the hardships experienced even by those who have work. \u201cThe price of everything has gone up. Food is the most expensive and then it is fuel for the car. Some things have gone up by 40-50%. Before the war my wife would go to the supermarket to shop and it would cost 200 hryvnia, now the same shop costs 400-500.\u201dFor those in the most difficult circumstances that has meant relying on handouts, no matter how small. In the town of Irpin just outside Kyiv, where heavy fighting took place at the beginning of the war as Russian armoured columns attempted to take the capital, the wrecked bridge that was used as an escape route by fleeing refugees is being rebuilt.  \n>  \n>Elsewhere damaged buildings are being repaired, cranes and work crews busy. But while the ground war long ago receded from Irpin, the economic consequences of conflict are still being felt sharply in a town where the population has been swelled by internally displaced fleeing the frontlines in the south and east.  \n>  \n>The most visible sign of the poverty crisis can be found at a protestant church in the town where priests have set up six distribution centres for free bread across the area, the busiest in Irpin itself. There, on most days, about 500 people can be found queuing for a free loaf, with tables and a tent also set up outside the centre on the day the Guardian visits, offering free secondhand shoes, clothes and children\u2019s toys.  \n>  \n>One resident of Irpin, Veronika Pravyk is looking through the clothes and trying to find free nappies and baby milk for her toddler, which are sometimes available but not today. She tells a typical story.

Like all those visiting the store, she does not want to give her family name.She says that when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, she was working as an accountant for a firm that employed 14 people, who were all laid off because of the conflict. Since then she has struggled to find regular work. With savings running out, like many others in Kyiv, she turned to pawning her possessions to get by, only finding a job a year later that allowed her to claim back her machines.As Oleksandra leaves clutching her belongings, save for a mobile phone she has decided not to redeem, the cashier, Oleksandr Stepanov, remarks from behind his hardened glass window that on a busy day the shop can get 50 people coming in to surrender mobile phones and household appliances.Those who can afford it, he says, will come back to get their goods within two weeks. Almost half, he adds, will not, leaving Treasure to sell on the items from a back room with displays of phones and watches. \u201cPeople are struggling because of the war. They don\u2019t have money.\u201d Many have lost their jobs, he says, while prices have skyrocketed even for those who have jobs.The scene in the pawn shop illustrates the crisis of growing poverty in Ukraine, the reality of which stands in contrast to the surface bustle of Kyiv\u2019s busy restaurants and bars where it is often hard to get a table, with many living a precarious existence.Poverty increased from 5.5% to 24.2% in Ukraine in 2022, pushing 7.1 million more people into poverty with the worst impact out of sight in rural villages, according to a recent report by the World Bank. With unemployment unofficially at 36% and inflation hitting 26.6% at the end of 2022, the institution\u2019s regional country director for eastern Europe, Arup Banerji, had warned that poverty could soar.Behind his window in Treasure, Stepanov describes the hardships experienced even by those who have work. \u201cThe price of everything has gone up. Food is the most expensive and then it is fuel for the car. Some things have gone up by 40-50%. Before the war my wife would go to the supermarket to shop and it would cost 200 hryvnia, now the same shop costs 400-500.\u201dFor those in the most difficult circumstances that has meant relying on handouts, no matter how small. In the town of Irpin just outside Kyiv, where heavy fighting took place at the beginning of the war as Russian armoured columns attempted to take the capital, the wrecked bridge that was used as an escape route by fleeing refugees is being rebuilt.  </p>\n\n<p>Elsewhere damaged buildings are being repaired, cranes and work crews busy. But while the ground war long ago receded from Irpin, the economic consequences of conflict are still being felt sharply in a town where the population has been swelled by internally displaced fleeing the frontlines in the south and east.  </p>\n\n<p>The most visible sign of the poverty crisis can be found at a protestant church in the town where priests have set up six distribution centres for free bread across the area, the busiest in Irpin itself. There, on most days, about 500 people can be found queuing for a free loaf, with tables and a tent also set up outside the centre on the day the Guardian visits, offering free secondhand shoes, clothes and children\u2019s toys.  </p>\n\n<p>One resident of Irpin, Veronika Pravyk is looking through the clothes and trying to find free nappies and baby milk for her toddler, which are sometimes available but not today. She tells a typical story. Working in retail before the war, the 30-year-old lost her job and fled with her family to Spain for six months where she burned through her savings before returning to Ukraine in the autumn.  </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not working but my husband is,\u201d she says. \u201cBut all the prices have gone up because of the war and my husband\u2019s salary buys less than it used to because of the falling exchange rate with the dollar.

Nonetheless, I believe my response still holds true. We cannot definitively say that no effort is being made to deliver planes, as discussions regarding this issue are actively taking place. \r  \n\r  \nWhen you ask why these weapons systems were pledged, it is important to consider the political capital required to do so. Take, for example, Germany and tanks. The process involved months of negotiations, a month of media drama, public pressure from Germany's allies, and significant efforts by the government to clarify that IFVs are not tanks, and only a small number of real tanks would be sent.

Although maybe I missed that bit as I was doing some chores while listening and half watching. If not, it's definitely worth thinking about how DEWs affect the hypersonic-to-interceptor cost ratios. Ground-based DEWs cost dollars per intercept. Something like a gallon of diesel gas for the US Army's anti-drone SHORAD system. Granted that is nowhere near powerful enough to take down a ballistic missile or an HGV, but even if it takes an insane 1,000,000 gallons of diesel that's still cheaper when compared to the $10m plus budgets to build each hypersonic missile. Whereas interceptor missiles would come with multi-million dollar costs comparable to the hypersonic, because as Perun points out, the interceptors need to have superior performance characteristics than the missiles they are intended to intercept.\n\nAlthough something like this is likely many years out still, interceptors equipped with DEWs for their terminal stage would not need to have superior performance characteristics than the hypersonics they are intercepting and so could be much cheaper. They'd just need to get close enough to be able to make their shot. That is an attractive option because the power requirements for a kill decrease proportionally to the square of the range. So even if the US can't scale DEWs to the power ranges needed to take out hypersonics from the ground (likely in the one megawatt range when current US tech is achieving something more on the order of 150 kilowatts), there are hybrid systems which are well within the boundaries of established science and engineering that could achieve good enough results. All of which I mention because it means DEW research is partially de-risked with regards to any as of yet unknown limiting factors that could prevent achieving the higher power levels required to intercept hypersonics from ground-based or seagoing platforms.\n\nWhile those more complex DEW systems may be more than a few years out, the simple laser-mounted-on-a-truck DEWs will likely prove to be extremely capable SHORAD systems in the meantime. That's part of what makes them a great investment from a defense expenditure perspective. Investments in DEWs provide outsized returns because they have the potential to check such a broad range of enemy munitions, from loitering drones to mortar shells all the way up to MARVs and HGVs (granted at much higher power requirements), all at an incredibly low unit cost. So if it costs approximately as much to develop DEW AD as it does to develop hypersonics, the DEWs would be by far the better investment because they are (or will be) capable of not only stopping hypersonic missiles but also much more numerous and low cost threats like Shahed drones or even mortar rounds, and doing so in an economical manner. \n\nThe US has a bunch of programs focused on DEWs, some of which at least seem to be coming together well and will potentially be operationalized for an increasing number of AD roles within the next few years, so this isn't science fiction. [Per the Congressional Research Service (pdf warning)](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/natsec/IF11882.pdf):\n\n> According to OUSD(R&E), DOD\u2019s current DE\nroadmap outlines DOD\u2019s plan to increase power levels of\nDE weapons from around 150 kilowatts (kW\u2014a unit of\npower), as is currently feasible, to 300 kW by FY2023,\n\u201cwith goal milestones to achieve 500 kW class with\nreduced size and weight by FY2025 and to further reduce\nsize and weight and increase power to MW [megawatt]\nlevels by FY2026.\u201d For reference, although there is no\nconsensus regarding the precise power level that would be\nneeded to neutralize different target sets, some analysts\nbelieve that lasers of around 100 kW could engage\nunmanned aircraft systems, small boats, rockets, artillery,\nand mortars, whereas lasers of around 300 kW could\nadditionally engage cruise missiles flying in certain profiles\n(i.e., flying across\u2014rather than at\u2014the laser).

                "body": "Well, the advantage here isn't that it can discover new optimizations that weren't previously discoverable with existing algorithms, but rather that it does so in \"an order of magnitude\" less time when producing novel designs for a previously unevaluated set of constraints (e.g., hull must be no more than 3.324m across and must displace 1.7 tons and must be made entirely of carbon fiber, with those given, what's the optimal hull shape?). The actual academic article is more precise in its language: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09544828.2023.2192606?journalCode=cjen20\n\nSpecifically, the advantage here is that it reduces the dimensionality of the design space, i.e., the set of possible hull shapes that meet the designer's specified requirements. Under current approaches to hull design, designers aren't evaluating every imaginable hull shape possible when designing hulls, because that would be a waste of time.

                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Well, the advantage here isn&#39;t that it can discover new optimizations that weren&#39;t previously discoverable with existing algorithms, but rather that it does so in &quot;an order of magnitude&quot; less time when producing novel designs for a previously unevaluated set of constraints (e.g., hull must be no more than 3.324m across and must displace 1.7 tons and must be made entirely of carbon fiber, with those given, what&#39;s the optimal hull shape?). The actual academic article is more precise in its language: <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09544828.2023.2192606?journalCode=cjen20\">https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09544828.2023.2192606?journalCode=cjen20</a></p>\n\n<p>Specifically, the advantage here is that it reduces the dimensionality of the design space, i.e., the set of possible hull shapes that meet the designer&#39;s specified requirements. Under current approaches to hull design, designers aren&#39;t evaluating every imaginable hull shape possible when designing hulls, because that would be a waste of time. Instead they constrain the design variables (length, width, displacement, whatever may be relevant to the model) somewhat before brute force cycling through possible designs that meet those criteria to calculate which design best meets their desired output variables (speed, fuel efficiency, etc).

Likely they would almost immediately begin to develop its defensive capacity to try to check that Ukrainian/NATO firepower you mention. And with Sevastopol in their possession, the Russians are that much closer to re-establishing the ability to project power throughout the Black Sea. Without Crimea, Russia would have to start a war, retake Crimea, and then start to project power into the western Black Sea before being able to reclaim the dominant regional power status they seemingly crave so much.\n\nIn the context of the current conversation, though, Putin's perception of Crimea's value matters more than the practical reality. And in his perception, the Russian people's perception matters more than reality, because he is afraid of them turning on him. If Putin sees Crimea's retention as essential to his survival because its loss would destroy his credibility with the Russian people, he will be that much more likely to resort to nuclear weapons in its defense.",

It's extremely common to deploy more elite units for protection details in unstable regions or where there is an elevated risk of harm to embassy staff. Like the US has Marines protecting embassies as a baseline, but they often deploy other units to enhance security where there is a demand. Especially these days, post-Benghazi, when no one wants to risk getting blamed for insufficient security at an embassy.\n\nWhile Kyiv may *not* present an elevated risk of random violence compared to some of the more traditionally troubled embassy locations where the local populace itself may present a risk to the ambassadorial staff (e.g., those in parts of North Africa or the Middle East), there is a very real possibility that British officials may get caught in the middle of professional Russian assassination attempts targeting the embassy staff's Ukrainian counterparts, without even having to step too far outside of the embassy grounds even. For example, imagine if an FSB hit squad followed the British ambassador to a meeting with Zelensky in order to get a chance to take Zelensky out, and started shooting with British personnel caught in the crossfire. Considering the number of reported plots against Zelensky, that seems like a risk worth considering and mitigating.\n\nJust in general, the war makes the situation in Kyiv much more unpredictable than what standard embassy security is used to dealing with. Between blackouts and bombs falling, more chaos requires cooler operators to handle. Also embassy staff can travel elsewhere in the country, e.g. to verify delivery of a shipment of weapons, or to coordinate aid efforts, or to provide assistance to a British citizen in need, or for a million other reasons. Any of which reasons could certainly take them much closer to the front.\n\nAll of which seems to justify a stronger protection detail than typical circumstances might demand. Personally, I'm agnostic about how to read this particular situation, but I do know that it isn't impossible that the SAS personnel are assigned to embassy security and personal security details and so wouldn't rule that theory out just yet.",

The US (and presumably other NATO allies) have been providing actionable intelligence before the war even began:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>As Russia launched its invasion, the U.S. gave Ukrainian forces detailed intelligence about exactly when and where Russian missiles and bombs were intended to strike, prompting Ukraine to move air defenses and aircraft out of harm\u2019s way, current and former U.S. officials told NBC News.</p>\n\n<p>That near real-time intelligence-sharing also paved the way for Ukraine to shoot down a Russian transport plane carrying hundreds of troops in the early days of the war, the officials say, helping repel a Russian assault on a key airport near Kyiv.</p>\n\n<p>It was part of what American officials call a massive and unprecedented intelligence-sharing operation with a non-NATO partner that they say has played a crucial role in Ukraine\u2019s success to date against the larger and better-equipped Russian military.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThere has been a lot of real-time intelligence shared in terms of things that could be used for specific targeting of Russian forces,\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/us-intel-helped-ukraine-protect-air-defenses-shoot-russian-plane-carry-rcna26015\">https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/us-intel-helped-ukraine-protect-air-defenses-shoot-russian-plane-carry-rcna26015</a></p>\n</div>",

Mostly using confirmed losses to begin pinning down the rough locations of Russian units and to establish what units are running what equipment.\n\n(2) Trawling through of Twitter from the time period for all news, especially news from people who 1- aren't particularly big accounts and 2- seem to have information which isn't pulled from elsewhere. For example, there was a random American woman who had a friend in Nedryhailiv who posted on the evening of February 24th that a Russian unit coming from the direction of Terny had turned back after facing resistance. 3 likes, no one else was talking about it, and *way* too specific of information for it to be disinfo. It also aligned with what 1st Tank Regiment was doing, movement wise.\n\n(3) Interviews from Ukrainian servicemembers from Ukrainian websites. This is how I starting locking down the movements of the battalions of the 58th Motorized Brigade. I also talked with the serving Ukrainian soldiers that I had preexisting connections with. That and some of them just responded to DMs, which was kind of them.\n\n(4) Reaching out to local journalists and leaders. I was finally able to pin down what happened at Priluky after I reached out to the local paper on Facebook. They also pointed me to the primary figures in the Priluky TDF that helped execute the ambush of 1st Tank Regiment alongside Ukrainian SOF.\n\n(5) Intuition, if all else fails. E.g. 95th Air Assault Brigade can be clearly placed at Horlivka on the Donbass front in early March. Yet they are also reported to have taken part in the retaking of Makariv alongside 14th Mechanized Brigade, near Kyiv. 95th Air Assault's garrison is in Zhytomyr, close to Kyiv. Most logical answer is that the brigade was on the Donbas front, but a unit was raised from its garrison (reservists, volunteers, ect.) and then fought with the 14th Mechanized.",

It also aligned with what 1st Tank Regiment was doing, movement wise.</p>\n\n<p>(3) Interviews from Ukrainian servicemembers from Ukrainian websites. This is how I starting locking down the movements of the battalions of the 58th Motorized Brigade. I also talked with the serving Ukrainian soldiers that I had preexisting connections with. That and some of them just responded to DMs, which was kind of them.</p>\n\n<p>(4) Reaching out to local journalists and leaders. I was finally able to pin down what happened at Priluky after I reached out to the local paper on Facebook. They also pointed me to the primary figures in the Priluky TDF that helped execute the ambush of 1st Tank Regiment alongside Ukrainian SOF.</p>\n\n<p>(5) Intuition, if all else fails. E.g. 95th Air Assault Brigade can be clearly placed at Horlivka on the Donbass front in early March. Yet they are also reported to have taken part in the retaking of Makariv alongside 14th Mechanized Brigade, near Kyiv. 95th Air Assault&#39;s garrison is in Zhytomyr, close to Kyiv. Most logical answer is that the brigade was on the Donbas front, but a unit was raised from its garrison (reservists, volunteers, ect.) and then fought with the 14th Mechanized.</p>\n</div>",

For example, in December they combined all the Right Sector volunteer battalions into their own brigade-- the 67th Mechanized. The separate Azov Battalions have also been combined into the National Guard's 3rd Assault Brigade. There were a good amount of Ukrainian regular brigades which were becoming extremely unwieldy. 72nd Mechanized *started* the war with six maneuver battalions (3 mechanized, 2 motorized, 1 tank) and likely only grew since with the addition of more volunteer units. The Ukrainians appear to be standing up a lot of units and I would heavily suspect that it's not just the political battalions which are being dissolved for replacements or combined into brigades. This applies the TDF. The regular brigades are pulling from the TDF for replacements, so it's likely that the TDF is being pared down and TDF brigades are moving towards a 3-4 bn structure standard.",
