The top-of-the-range model is loaded with the latest tech, which Western armies can learn from*\n\nhttps://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/09/26/why-the-capture-of-a-russian-t-90m-tank-matters?utm_content=article-link-5&etear=nl_today_5&utm_campaign=r.the-economist-today&utm_medium=email.internal-newsletter.np&utm_source=salesforce-marketing-cloud&utm_term=9/26/2022&utm_id=1331717\n\nUkraine\u2019s rapid offensive in Kharkiv, in the country\u2019s north-east, brought many prizes. Swathes of territory have been won back and Ukraine\u2019s army captured around a brigade\u2019s worth of military equipment from the fleeing Russians. One of the greatest surprises uncovered was a single t-90m tank. It is one of at least 380 Russian tanks seized since the war began, yet it is uniquely useful. What is the t-90m tank, and why does it matter?\n\nSeizing a weapon can provide valuable insight into the state of an enemy\u2019s military technology. That makes countries protective of their weapons in war. American efforts to inspect the t-72 throughout the Cold War backfired on several occasions, until a rogue Romanian arms dealer sold one to American agents in 1987, supposedly as scrap metal. The deal was later uncovered and made public by the kgb. The prized t-72 had been in service for 14 years before America finally had a chance to inspect it, by which time it had already been superseded. By contrast, the t-90m has been in service for just two years.\n\nThe t90-m\u2014also known as Proryv-3, meaning \u201cbreakthrough\u201d\u2014is Russia\u2019s best active tank. It is an upgrade of the earlier t-90 model which was introduced in the early 1990s. Both models, of which the army has several hundred, are far superior to the Soviet tanks still widely used by both Russia and Ukraine. t-90ms were not deployed during the initial invasion. Some analysts suspected that they were being reserved for a possible war with nato\u2014until they appeared a couple of months into the war.\n\nThe tank has several levels of defence. The outermost is a \u201cstealth cape\u201d called Nakidka, an unknown material that Russia claims can absorb both heat and radio signals. This coating theoretically cloaks the t-90m from nato\u2019s airborne radars, which track Russian vehicles at long range. It also hinders the use of guided anti-tank missiles which rely on thermal imaging to lock onto their target. On top of that, the tank has an Afghanit active protection system, which fires projectiles to intercept attacks at short range. Any attacks that reach the t90-m tank must also penetrate its explosive reactive armour, used by many models of Russian tanks, which can disrupt the detonation of anti-tank missiles. Finally there is the tank\u2019s physical armour, a closely guarded secret.\n\nThe t-90m is not invulnerable: Ukrainian forces have already destroyed one. But capturing one is far more useful. Being able to disassemble and analyse a top-of-the-range Russian tank will make it easier to defeat more t90-ms in future. As well as its high-tech defences, the captured tank has the latest Russian offensive weaponry, including a computerised fire-control system and a gun capable of firing guided projectiles. The captured t-90m specimen will give military analysts a chance to assess Russia\u2019s claims about these capabilities. And as the war in Ukraine grinds on, the intelligence bonanza will continue. The West has already gained access to a variety of Russian radar, intelligence gathering and command vehicles with their valuable secrets. Fleeing Russian soldiers ought to be more careful about what they leave behind.",

It risks confrontation in the Baltic Sea (a confrontation Russia would lose) and entry of superior forces into the conflict on the high end, and further superior equipment on the low end. It also would firmly indicate to European citizens that it is Russia, not stubborn westerners, at fault for the gas crisis, disarming the narrative of useful idiots across the continent.

Reportedly these are operated by a branch of the military that reports more or less directly to Putin.</p>\n\n<p>The depth of one of the explosion sites is apparently 70 m, which would make simple divers unlikely. It&#39;d require technical diving and related support equipment, in which case why not just use an AUV.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t believe even state of the art torpedos have sensors accurate enough to guide them to a point on the sea bed.</p>\n\n<p>An annoying wrinkle to this is, charges could have been pre-placed as a contingency at some point in the past. Done with a little care, it&#39;d be effectively impossible to identify who did it.</p>\n</div>",

Svatove is more approachable from the north in Kupiansk. And the reason that Svatove is important is because it's the artery from the north that supplies Kreminna and Rubizhne. If you have Svatove, you can approach Kreminna from the north-west, instead of from the south-west from Liman. Now, I'll agree with you that Svatove to Kreminna is a harder attack than Liman to Kreminna.\n\n**But**, Liman to Svatove is also a harder attack. Which is why they are both important. BUT...you can definitely bypass Liman, but you can not bypass Svatove if you want to take Kreminna, then Rubizhne. I mean, technically you can, but it'd be ill advisable.\n\nEDIT: to illustrate my point, and not to suggest that Russian tactical battlefield planning is the paragon on which Ukraine should model itself, but the Russians took Kreminna 6 weeks prior to taking Liman. They attacked in force from Svatove and took the town essentially overnight. Liman, on the other hand, took a lot longer to fall. In fact, even Rubizhne fell a couple weeks before Liman. Now, you could argue that Russia was attacking from a different axis, and that's partially true, but the overall point stands. Liman is important, but not critical.",

It, uh, hasn't worked out great for them thus far. \n\nThat isn't at all how Russian tactics work. They predominantly use Reconnaissance Fire Complex, aka probing attacks, using ground forces as sensors to test UAF defenses, more importantly to find them (even inadvertently, in conjunction with overhead ISR drones overwatching the advances). When those are found, they're hit by fires. \n\nIt's discussed [here](https://geopolitics-decanted.simplecast.com/episodes/analysis-of-the-war-in-ukraine-august-3-2022) by a UAF reserve colonel, Michael Kofman, Lester Grau, and Charles Bartles have all written on it in the past.\n\nNow they have done plenty of reckless frontal assaults in this war, we're talking about the Russians after all, but if that was the rule and not the exception then they'd have run out of combat manpower months ago. Remember, just in the first month they lost roughly 25-33% of their total combat strength. Since then they've fed maybe a few tens of thousands of replacements into the line, but they've also been attacking non-stop for seven months. All things considered, they've been quite cautious in how they've been attacking. Their lack of progress is a reason, the tactics they've been using are slooooooooow by nature. \n\n>Ukraine on the other hand has repeatedly shown that when possible it will circumvent strong points and force Russia to abandon them by outflanking them. See recent example in Izyum.\n\nThat's because Ukraine has quite a bit more freedom to choose where to attack for multiple reasons. Anywhere the Russians are holding Ukraine territory becomes a legitimate target for a UAF counterattack or counteroffensive, which is a lot of space since the front lines are something like 800 km long. If they reclaim any ground it's a strategic victory for them, giving them lots of freedom in picking and choosing where to conduct ops. As it is they've not actually followed any sort of main effort defensive strategy coupled with economy of force in supporting fronts, they've been doing counteroffensives all around Ukraine pretty much nonstop since April. \n\nIn comparison, since April the Russians have been focusing on taking strategically designated locations as part of their main effort (predominantly the Donbas), which were announced in advance, obvious to everyone, and then defended in strength by a military force that realistically outnumbers the Russian force in Ukraine by a minimum of 3x. So the Russians can't exactly attack a UAF weak point because then they'd have to find an area that is of no strategic importance, it would not be in Donbas. \n\nHowever, let's say they managed to find and hit a Ukraine weakpoint that was outside the Donbas, just wanting a W on the scoreboard. They'd need to reinforce it first with more troops which would be caught because the Ukrainians have access to the greatest intelligence apparatus that currently exists (their own, plus all NATO partners). That means it's basically impossible for the Russians to shift forces and achieve operational surprise, let alone tactical surprise, to hit an UAF weak point. \n\nThat said, exceptions happen and the Russians had been able to pull it off on a few occasions, namely the Popasna and Zolote breakthroughs, though those had more to do with UAF mismanagement than Russian success. Also, the Pisky area was a weak point for a while, which was why they were attacking it (though that was L/DNR corps, not Russians).",

I guess a high level of mechanization plays a part, but at the end of the day it&#39;s still infantry storming the trenchlines.</p>\n</div>",

The problem was that for high explosive rounds, the fuses of the time were not very good and the shells tended to bury themselves into the ground and detonate, causing most the blast to be directed into the ground. This did not cut wire effectively, at best it would throw the wire into the air, and then the wire would fall back to the ground uncut. It might not be properly held up, but attacking soldiers would still have to spend time trying to step through the jumble of wire and they'd be shot in the mean time.\n\nThe other option was shrapnel shells, which could cut wire but only if it exploded at a precise distance from the wire to have enough force. Since theses were timed fuses based on calculations and guess work, it tended to be hit or miss. Also the Germans in 1916 started making barbed wire thicker to be more resistant to shrapnel shot, part of the reason the first day of the Somme was such a blood bath as the Shrapnel shells were far less effective than expected at cutting wire.\n\nWhat happened in 1917 (for the British at least) was that new \"Instantaneous\" fuses came into service, allowing HE shells to blast apart barbed wire far more effectively. This is why the British attack at Cambrai in 1917 worked so well with basically a very brief preparatory bombardment, you didn't need to blast away for days to clear wire anymore, a furious bombardment of a few hours could do it and tanks could deal with the rest by driving over it.\n\nWhy do you less barbed wire in WWII tench systems? Basically because instantaneous fuses were the norm at that point, so any deep barbed wire system could be cleared with with a few hours of shelling and any supporting tanks. It still had its uses in that heavy barbed wire would discourage any kind of hasty attack, you'd need a thoroughly prepared attack to get through. But it wasn't the barrier in WW2 that it was throughout much of WW1.\n\nModern day 155mm shells with current fuses would decimate barbed wire lines, especially with drones correcting for fire. The gun calibers of WW1 that effectively cut barbed wire in 1917 and 1918 were much smaller, between 75 to 90mm for common field guns.",

But let's assume they did to try and suss out why they would do so.\n\nDestroying NS1 is a demonstrative act, a clear threat of escalation. It's several steps below directly attacking a NATO state or deploying a tactical nuke, but still a threat to Europe'a gas supplies. The NS is not the only pipeline in the Baltics and the North Sea. There are several more.\n\nEurope gets its energy from two methods: by pipe and by ship. Piped gas is cheaper while shipped gas needs to be liquefied and is thus more expensive. Piped gas into the continent flows from three axes discounting Russia: the Baltic/North Sea, from Africa across the Med, and from the Middle East (Azerbaijan et al). Russia can snip the northern sea access and Middle East access. That will leave the Med pipelines and shipped LNG--and lead to a total collapse in European energy markets.\n\nThere's not an easy solution here, for NATO, if Russia starts cutting pipelines. Sure, we could start attacking Russian infrastructure in kind but that is a path towards nuclear annihilation and doesn't solve the problem of the new lack of energy. In other words, if Russia tomorrow cut all pipelines, attacking their military convoys in Ukraine won't bring the gas back on. In fact, given the damage, new pipelines might have to be laid, as the old ones might be impossible to repair. So to prevent more attacks and allow for peace conditions to allow for repairs, the calculus is that Europe will sue for some sort of peace.\n\nThe only feasible military response would be to engage in sub-hunting for Russian subs in the north seas (Azerbaijan oil supply can be ruled out if Russia targets it). But now we're talking about protecting thousands of miles of underwater pipe, of varying depths, against a foe that is at least competent in sub-warfare.",

Fissile materials.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/russianforces/status/1574873398060130325\n\n----------\n\n**Pavel Podvig** is an independent analyst based in Geneva, where he runs his research project, \"Russian Nuclear Forces.\" He is also a Senior Research Fellow at the UN Institute for Disarmament Research and a researcher with the Program on Science and Global Security at Princeton University. Pavel Podvig started his work on arms control at the Center for Arms Control Studies at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT), which was the first independent research organization in Russia dedicated to analysis of technical issues of disarmament and nonproliferation. Pavel Podvig led the Center for Arms Control Studies project that produced the book, Russian Strategic Nuclear Forces (MIT Press, 2001). In recognition of his work in Russia, the American Physical Society awarded Podvig the Leo Szilard Lectureship Award of 2008 (with Anatoli Diakov). Podvig worked with the Program on Science and Global Security at Princeton University, the Security Studies Program at MIT, and the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University. His current research focuses on the Russian strategic forces and nuclear weapons complex, as well as technical and political aspects of nuclear nonproliferation, disarmament, missile defense, and U.S.-Russian arms control process. Pavel Podvig is a member of the International Panel on Fissile Materials. He has a  physics degree from MIPT and PhD in political science from the Moscow Institute of World Economy and International Relations.\n\nhttps://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/people/pavel_podvig\n\n---------\n\n\n* It's understandable that a few recent developments again made people worry again about nuclear use. I don't have a crystal ball, but there are a few things to consider. And they seem to suggest that we are still at least a few steps away from that point. 1/11\n\n* First, the US keeps telling us that there are no signs of Russia's being prepared to use its weapons. But would they see them? I would say, most likely. 2/11\nPavel Podvig\n@russianforces\n\u00b7\n4h\n* With the exception of ICBMs and SLBMs, none of nuclear weapons are \"deployed\" - bombs are not loaded on aircraft, warheads are not mated to missiles. There are no Iskanders roaming around with nuclear-armed warheads. These weapons are in storage. 3/11\nPavel Podvig\n@russianforces\n\u00b7\n4h\n* They may not be very far from airbases (a few kilometers) or from missile bases (a few hours drive), but they are in bunkers. Yes, there is a procedure for deploying them, but it's a procedure. 4/11\nPavel Podvig\n@russianforces\n\u00b7\n4h\n* You have to take weapons out of the bunker, load them on trucks, drive them to the designated point, load them/mate warheads. As any process, it is visible. The US/NATO observed it during many exercises. 5/11\nPavel Podvig\n@russianforces\n\u00b7\n4h\n* Now, it might be possible to \"sneak out\" a few warheads - nobody can watch everything all the time - but Russia can never be certain that the movement is not detected. You never know who is watching you. It could be SIGINT or a guy with binoculars on the hill nearby. 6/11\nPavel Podvig\n@russianforces\n\u00b7\n4h\n* And, of course, there is absolutely no reason for Russia to hide any development like this. If the idea is to send a signal that you are ready to escalate (which would be the case in the \"few warheads\" scenario), you send the signal. You would want it to be visible. 7/11\nPavel Podvig\n@russianforces\n\u00b7\n4h\n* Now, speaking of signals, so far all \"threats\" made by Russia were very much defensive - if you attack us we will respond. All official statements have been very consistent - it is about an \"aggression that threatens the very existence of the state.\" 8/11\nPavel Podvig\n@russianforces\n\u00b7\n4h\n* Yes, we may have a debate about how the Kremlin could interpret \"the very existence\" and indeed there is quite a bit of wiggle room there. But we cannot deny that the core message is that of a defensive response (and should insist on the narrowest interpretation). 9/11\nPavel Podvig\n@russianforces\n\u00b7\n4h\n* Moving non-strategic weapons out of storage (presumably in preparation for use) would be quite inconsistent with that \"defensive\" message. This is not to say that the message cannot be changed, but it will have to be changed. And we haven't seen that change yet. 10/11\nPavel Podvig\n@russianforces\n\u00b7\n4h\n* Of course, this invasion taught me to be (very) careful about making assumptions about what Moscow can or cannot do. But I do think that there is certain logic to this madness and that this logic should not be totally disregarded. 11/11",

Gazprom obviously would not be involved in planning any sabotage missions, it would be the FSB or some similar agency that wouldn't risk leaking the plan by looping in any civilians. As for the motivation, the civil penalties are likely more or less unenforceable against Gazprom anyway, because they have few valuable assets outside of Russia that can be seized to service any unpaid debts. \n\nIf it was Russia, I suspect it's Putin pulling a Cortes and burning his ships behind him to head off any internal attempts to normalize relations with Europe after some sort of coup. Or it is an implicit threat, as in, \"next time it will be infrastructure you actually depend on.\" \n\nOr, and I actually think this is the most likely scenario, it's an effort to avoid Russia bearing the blame for any energy crisis in Europe this winter. The Russians need the Europeans to depend on them for gas, but the Europeans aren't dumb enough to do so if they know the Russians will use the gas as leverage. I suspect the Russians (if responsible at all) think they can blame literally anyone else at all for the pipelines being shut down, and then use that misinformation to generate FUD to fracture the western alliance by deflecting blame for the energy crisis. Ideally toward the US or Ukraine, but again I don't think they would care so long as it gets at least some Europeans to blame anyone other than Russia. Then they get to inflict the economic pain without taking the blame.\n\nAlternatively, I see three major candidates for sabotage: the Saudis, Ukraine, and the US.\n\nI could sort of see it being the Saudis exploiting a moment of geopolitical uncertainty to increase their long term leverage over Europe. But I doubt they have the capabilities to pull something like this off in the first place, never mind to then keep it secret from their western allies. Just look at how thoroughly western intel agencies were able to track the plot to murder Jamal Khashoggi. So it would be enormously risky, and would yield at best marginal and totally unpredictable benefits to the Saudis.\n\nUkraine obviously does not possess this level of underwater sabotage capability (otherwise the Kerch bridge would long since have been demolished), nor can they spare the resources to acquire those capabilities, nor does the damage to the pipelines really benefit them all that much compared to the risk of alienating their allies if the plot were to be uncovered. \n\nThat leaves the US. The only scenario I can envision the US taking this step would be with the express permission of the German government, with the understanding that damaging the pipelines would provide political cover to allow the German government to continue boycotting Russian gas during the potentially impending winter energy crisis. Which... if so, well, good for them I guess. One day many years from now when everything is declassified, maybe we will learn the truth and it will have been super convoluted NATO disinformation operation. But just going by my gut, that seems unnecessarily risky given the strong continuing support for Ukraine and the relatively solid buffer of energy reserves the Europeans have managed to store up over the past few months. \n\nI also have difficulty imagining the US pulling off such an operation without at least one of their allies in the region catching wind of it, and it would pose such an enormous risk to US-EU relations for such a marginal benefit that I just don't see Biden signing up for a mission like that without the explicit support of the Germans.

This is why you had Javelins and Hellfires being lobbed at a single insurgent in Afghanistan for example.\n\nEdit: since u/7dayban reply won't show up for some reason: the argument that missiles costing more than the thing they are shooting at is bullshit. The value of the drone isn't the cost, it's what it can do, whether it be intel or destruction of property and lives. Using your logic, why does Israel bother with Iron Dome if it 'loses' millions of dollars every time Hamas launches rockets? Or stingers being using on Mavics?",

A small nuclear weapon detonated over the Black Sea, for example.  \n\n\nA nuclear attack in Ukraine to achieve a tactical goal (disrupting a counter-offensive) or a strategic strike on Ukrainian command and control (a direct strike against Kyiv).  \n\n\nAn extreme scenario of a preemptive strike against NATO (highly unlikely)  \n\n\nThese scenarios, namely 1 and 2, are widely accepted among experts as the likely Russian usage of nuclear weapons in Ukraine.  \n\n\n**WHAT WOULD A WESTERN RESPONSE TO NUCLEAR WEAPONS ENTAIL?**  \n\n\n\u201cWe have communicated directly, privately and at very high levels to the Kremlin that any use of nuclear weapons will be met with catastrophic consequences for Russia, that the US and our allies will respond decisively, and we have been clear and specific about what that will entail.\u201d - Jake Sullivan, US National Security Advisor, 9/25/2022  \n\n\n\u201cRussia would become more of a pariah in the world than they ever have been.

There are two taboos at play here, a nuclear taboo and a taboo of direct conflict between the US and Russia.  If the US doesn't think their warnings were taken seriously, they would not want to wait to break the second taboo reactively after nuclear weapons are involved in the conflict, as that makes the risk of escalation to a full-blown nuclear exchange unacceptably high.
