However, there doesn't yet appear to be any political consensus around the issue of sending lethal aid,\" he said.\n\n>Japan is one of dozens of friends and allies that Washington is asking to help arm Ukraine as it wrestles with stretched military supply chains.\n\n>South Korea, which also uses 155mm shells, is among those the U.S. has approached. A South Korean defence official told Reuters that Seoul's stance against providing lethal aid to Kyiv had not changed.\n\n>Asked in Tokyo this week about the possibility of a shift in Japanese policy on lethal aid, Austin said at a press briefing that any change would be a matter for Japan but \"any bit of support\" for Ukraine was \"always welcome\".\n\n>The sources who spoke to Reuters declined to identify the Japanese company that would supply explosives to the U.S. government and did not say how much TNT Washington wanted to buy.\n\n>Reuters contacted 22 explosives makers listed on the Japan Explosives Industry Association's website. The only one that said it made industrial TNT was Chugoku Kayaku, an Hiroshima-based firm that supplies Japan's military.\n\n>\"We have not received any direct inquiry from the U.S. government or U.S. military,\" the company said in an email.\n\n>Asked if it was discussing any TNT sales through an intermediary, the firm, which lists an industrial TNT product on its website, said it did not disclose the identity of customers or potential buyers.\n\n>>JAPAN'S NEXT MOVE\n\n>Supplying commercial TNT to the U.S. may only be a stop-gap measure because many lawmakers of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) want to ease or eliminate the export restrictions.\n\n>In December, when Kishida announced Japan's five-year military build-up, he pledged to revise the export rules, opening up the possibility that Japan could supply lethal weapons not only to Ukraine, but to other nations that Tokyo and Washington see as potential allies against Russia and China.\n\n>Akihisa Nagashima, a former deputy defence minister and a ranking LDP member of the parliamentary committee on national security, said the military build-up would take Japan four-fifths of the way to becoming a \"normal country\" unencumbered by the legacy of its World War Two defeat.\n\n>\"Tackling the export restrictions is the remaining 20%,\" he said.\n\nAnother one of the downstream effects of Putin\u2019s blunder is that it may yet, unlikely as it seems, push Japan to change Articles 9 and 96, which may blunt Xi\u2019s ambitions on Taiwan.",

Or whether the particular soldiers wearing it are dedicated breachers or AIFV gunners for whom the tradeoffs are worth it.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately not a critical point, just something I found slightly unusual. &quot;Interesting - but not <em>very</em> interesting - to note...&quot;</p>\n</div>",

Deadlock over a solution has left Russia expecting the surplus to rise further, according to people familiar with the negotiations.\n\n>Every quarter, the imbalance will likely generate the equivalent of $2 billion to $3 billion that Russia can\u2019t use, according to Bloomberg Economics. The amount would add to an estimated $147 billion in net foreign assets built up abroad over the course of 2022.\n\n>\u201cThe reason is a sharp boost in the volume of oil supplies from Russia,\u201d said Irina Zasedatel, a member of the presidium of Russia\u2019s Association of Exporters and Importers. \u201cAgainst the backdrop of an increase in the growth of oil sales, there\u2019s little sign of expansion in the supply of other goods.\u201d\n\n>An impasse at the negotiating table between India and Russia is complicating their booming one-way trade. In the first quarter, India had a trade deficit $14.7 billion with Russia.\n\n>A top priority for India is to promote the wider use of the rupee in international settlements. The central bank has suggested that countries accumulating excess rupees from exports can put the funds in local securities including government bonds.\n\n>The two countries are discussing various payment mechanisms including investments in India\u2019s capital markets by Russian entities.\n\n>It\u2019s an option that initially didn\u2019t find favor with Moscow but is now back on the table as billions of rupees pile up in Indian banks, officials in India familiar with the details said, asking not to be named because discussions were private. Other possibilities include channeling the accumulated rupees into Indian infrastructure projects in exchange for equity stakes.\n\n>For Russia, the only acceptable option is to use currencies of a third country, such as China\u2019s yuan or the United Arab Emirates dirham, said people familiar with the deliberations. An agreement is far off since Russia has limited sway in a situation with few alternative buyers to India, they said.\n\n>>\u201cRussia\u2019s trade with India is increasingly imbalanced.

Deadlock over a solution has left Russia expecting the surplus to rise further, according to people familiar with the negotiations.</p>\n\n<p>Every quarter, the imbalance will likely generate the equivalent of $2 billion to $3 billion that Russia can\u2019t use, according to Bloomberg Economics. The amount would add to an estimated $147 billion in net foreign assets built up abroad over the course of 2022.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe reason is a sharp boost in the volume of oil supplies from Russia,\u201d said Irina Zasedatel, a member of the presidium of Russia\u2019s Association of Exporters and Importers. \u201cAgainst the backdrop of an increase in the growth of oil sales, there\u2019s little sign of expansion in the supply of other goods.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>An impasse at the negotiating table between India and Russia is complicating their booming one-way trade. In the first quarter, India had a trade deficit $14.7 billion with Russia.</p>\n\n<p>A top priority for India is to promote the wider use of the rupee in international settlements. The central bank has suggested that countries accumulating excess rupees from exports can put the funds in local securities including government bonds.</p>\n\n<p>The two countries are discussing various payment mechanisms including investments in India\u2019s capital markets by Russian entities.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s an option that initially didn\u2019t find favor with Moscow but is now back on the table as billions of rupees pile up in Indian banks, officials in India familiar with the details said, asking not to be named because discussions were private. Other possibilities include channeling the accumulated rupees into Indian infrastructure projects in exchange for equity stakes.</p>\n\n<p>For Russia, the only acceptable option is to use currencies of a third country, such as China\u2019s yuan or the United Arab Emirates dirham, said people familiar with the deliberations. An agreement is far off since Russia has limited sway in a situation with few alternative buyers to India, they said.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cRussia\u2019s trade with India is increasingly imbalanced. India\u2019s exports to Russia haven\u2019t caught up with booming imports, but there\u2019s a limited appetite in Russia to save its current-account surplus in rupees. That said, there are no alternative oil importers of India\u2019s caliber on the horizon for Russia, so exporters and banks will gradually accept settlement in rupees.

There are plenty of more mundane reasons for the tepidness and sluggishness of support. But conspiracy or not, the effect is the same. UA cannot make any kind of significant play until they have the means and logistics to carry it out. If they are only able to implement these weapons one at a time, in small scale attacks that deplete supplies quickly. If they do not have the flexibility to take advantage of enemy weakness and make an attack because promised critical resources are delayed. Then the impact of getting any of these weapons is significantly depleted. </p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s like taking the kinetic energy from a heavyweight one-two punch in 2 seconds and turning it into a series of finger pokes over the space of five hours.</p>\n</div>",

If anything, my hypothesis for the reasoning behind the sluggishness is that western powers believe it\u2019s the less risky option to bleed RU slowly by giving UA just enough to keep fighting but not enough to gain the critical strategic advantage that could possibly escalate the war or turn western popular support due to cost.\n\nMy response to that is that RU is not the chicken being slapped in this analogy. UA is. The war is on Ukrainian soil, the destruction and civilian death is almost 100% Ukrainian. So even though RU soldiers are dying in their 10s of thousands, the Russian state is largely unscathed in comparison to the pile of burning rubble that UA is turning into. Over time RU citizens may wake up to the fact that Russian blood is draining into UA, but most of them are still comfortably asleep right now. And they in large part can still afford to be. They may be a bit poorer. They may may not have some of the cool western brands and products they like. But they have not had to put up with the constant threat of terror bombing. A threat with no end in sight. They have not had to deal with full scale mobilization. They have not had to leave their homes for foreign sanctuary only to see that their home was blown up months later and they have little to nothing to go back to. They have not had their farms and fields turned into toxic no man\u2019s lands filled with mines and UXO that will take decades to restore. \n\nYou can cook a chicken by slapping, but Ukraine is the chicken. There is very little that can be done short of nuclear war that would make RU pay the same price that UA has paid and will pay to maintain their sovereignty. The only way out that can at least mitigate the damage done is to give UA the means to regain and hold their territory quickly. Otherwise the cost disparity between the two nations will only increase and the price of rebuilding Ukraine after this is all over will be too much for most Ukrainians to bare and go back to.",

You\u2019re gonna lose points if you do that\u2019. So what does it start doing? It starts destroying the communication tower that the operator uses to communicate with the drone to stop it from killing the target.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>This example, seemingly plucked from a science fiction thriller, mean that: \u201cYou can&#39;t have a conversation about artificial intelligence, intelligence, machine learning, autonomy if you&#39;re not going to talk about ethics and AI\u201d said Hamilton.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.aerosociety.com/news/highlights-from-the-raes-future-combat-air-space-capabilities-summit/\">https://www.aerosociety.com/news/highlights-from-the-raes-future-combat-air-space-capabilities-summit/</a>  near the bottom of the page</p>\n\n<p>Edit: </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/4a33gj/ai-controlled-drone-goes-rogue-kills-human-operator-in-usaf-simulated-test?utm_source=vicenewstwitter\">https://www.vice.com/en/article/4a33gj/ai-controlled-drone-goes-rogue-kills-human-operator-in-usaf-simulated-test?utm_source=vicenewstwitter</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cCol Hamilton admits he \u2018mis-spoke\u2019 in his presentation at the FCAS Summit and the &#39;rogue AI drone simulation&#39; was a hypothetical &quot;thought experiment&quot; from outside the military, based on plausible scenarios and likely outcomes rather than an actual USAF real-world simulation,\u201d the Royal Aeronautical Society, the organization where Hamilton talked about the simulated test, told Motherboard in an email.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We&#39;ve never run that experiment, nor would we need to in order to realise that this is a plausible outcome,\u201d Col. Tucker \u201cCinco\u201d Hamilton, the USAF&#39;s Chief of AI Test and Operations, said in a quote included in the Royal Aeronautical Society\u2019s statement. &quot;Despite this being a hypothetical example, this illustrates the real-world challenges posed by AI-powered capability and is why the Air Force is committed to the ethical development of AI&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

        "body": "Yesterday I did some napkin math trying to guess at the current size of the Russian ground forces involved in Ukraine. Super rough and approximate, I would absolutely appreciate additional sources and thoughts! \n\nThe US leaks estimated (low confidence!) 145k \u201cpersonnel\u201d in Ukraine, 5k just across the border, and 22k PMC Wagner for a total of 172k men.\n\nThe leaks don\u2019t offer a lot of good clues about what \u201cpersonnel\u201d represents. It definitely includes almost all regular/reserve combat formations and most irregulars. It might exclude some air defense and artillery units. It might also leave out supply troops, ground crews and service troops, and civilian contractors and MoD employees.\nI would wager that it refers to \u201ccombat strength\u201d, with actual strength maybe twice that size.\n\nRussia began the war with some 200k men, reportedly mobilized 200-300k more, and probably received an additional 50-100k from volunteers/BARS, DPR/LPR conscripts, and \u201cunofficial\u201d mobilization. So 450-600k total men.\n\nAs far as I\u2019m aware, the 200k conscripts for Spring 2023 will not be deployed without signing contracts.\n\nThe US leaks estimated 35-43k KIA by the end of February and an additional 150-180k WIA. I think by now 50k KIA and 200k WIA are reasonable numbers.\n\nFor the WIA, lets assume a good 75% rate of return to service (perhaps too generous). That would give 150k wounded and recovered and 50k no longer fit for service. Some of that 150k will no longer be combat capable and relegated to support roles.\n\nThese numbers are complicated by the variations in Russian terms of service. Some troops may be sent back to the fight even with nasty wounds (DPR/LPR conscripts, mobiks, convicts, etc) while others may be combat capable but their contracts end once they\u2019re wounded.\n\nYou also have both desertion and \u201chidden\u201d desertion from non-renewal of contracts which expired in \u201822, before mobilization extended them indefinitely. I haven\u2019t seen any good numbers for this, but with high refusal to deploy and non-renewal rates reported in many units it likely stands in the thousands. There are also issues with units and branches \u201cbuying\u201d soldiers and shifting them around illegally. This can leave men trapped in a \u201cgrey zone\u201d where they\u2019re deployed but not actually doing anything or part of an organized outfit.\n\nFinally, you have losses from illness, accidents, and so on. Some number of wounded, in the 10s of thousands, will also be convalescing right now.\n\nIn total, I think another 50-100k permanent/long term losses from all causes is reasonable.\n\nThat gives 150-200k currently out of action. Subtracted from manpower mobilized, that gives a low estimate of 250k total troops and a high one of 450k.\n\nI think 150-200k troops in combat formations and 350k total is a reasonable guess, but it\u2019s in the middle of a very big range!\n\nThe leaks also had estimates about how many units were combat-effective. Their guess was that Russia had committed 97% of its available battalions/equivalent formations to Ukraine, or 527. Of those, 474 were in Ukraine itself. As of March 1, 364 were combat-effective (94 regular, 29 reserve/territorial, and 241 auxiliary/irregular) and 110 were ineffective (72 regular, 11 reserve, and 27 irregular).\n\nAround 25% of combat formations, including over 40% of regular formations, were combat-ineffective by March 1. 2/3 of Russia combat-effective formations were irregular or auxiliary formations. Many parts of the front at that point were held, and still are held, by exhausted/irregular formations.\n\nRussia hasn\u2019t brought in a large amount of manpower since the end of last year, and it was wasteful with what it had. Even after the February offensives everyone heard about, frontal attacks without progress have been pretty much relentless. As a result, Russia\u2019s forces have continued to degrade in both quantity and quality. The continued deployment of fought-out formations from hot zone to hot zone - brigades from Vuhledar/Kreminna to Bakhmut\u2019s flanks most recently - underscores how bad things are. I don\u2019t think things have meaningfully improved since March, and they may have worsened!",

IF in the future you/source do happen to be right, you've already biased people against the end conclusion.
