The terrain is really hard to overcome. claims it's doomed to fail, if they make any \"success\" they'd just bump into the oskil river. The densely forested terrain is difficult for offensive action. \n\n\\-claims the counter offensive isn't measured in KM, but rather in attrition of the enemy. claims Russia is losing a lot of equipment tying to constantly plug the line. Offensive hasn't reached mobile phase. \n\n\\-Russia is losing a lot of well trained troops, plugging them with mobilized troops. (this is what prigozhin also said about what happened to the VDV)\n\n\\-He says that during Kherson offensive they(ukraine) suffered major casualties in initial strategy of frontal attacks, and they switched tactics to dismantling of Russian troops in the area with superior recon, precision weapons, and high ground. (could be true as popov went public to say counter battery is messing them up)\n\n \\-says that 2 things will happen in the near future, collapse of russian defense leading to encirclement and chaotic withdrawal or russia will declare withdrawal similar to kherson. (not sure how far back or where based off the video)\n\n\\- says command has gotten much better, says one year ago it was very chaotic compared to where they are at now. Still much work to do, but improvements were made. (think he means it went from an D- to like a C.)\n\n\\- interesting he claims Russia's command and tactical ability has degraded, says they were much better organized during last years Kherson offensive. Says they are defending, but they are very chaotic and jittery and lack organization. Could lead to a major rout. The russian southern and western defenses may collapse.

The terrain is really hard to overcome. claims it&#39;s doomed to fail, if they make any &quot;success&quot; they&#39;d just bump into the oskil river. The densely forested terrain is difficult for offensive action. </p>\n\n<p>-claims the counter offensive isn&#39;t measured in KM, but rather in attrition of the enemy. claims Russia is losing a lot of equipment tying to constantly plug the line. Offensive hasn&#39;t reached mobile phase. </p>\n\n<p>-Russia is losing a lot of well trained troops, plugging them with mobilized troops. (this is what prigozhin also said about what happened to the VDV)</p>\n\n<p>-He says that during Kherson offensive they(ukraine) suffered major casualties in initial strategy of frontal attacks, and they switched tactics to dismantling of Russian troops in the area with superior recon, precision weapons, and high ground. (could be true as popov went public to say counter battery is messing them up)</p>\n\n<p>-says that 2 things will happen in the near future, collapse of russian defense leading to encirclement and chaotic withdrawal or russia will declare withdrawal similar to kherson. (not sure how far back or where based off the video)</p>\n\n<p>- says command has gotten much better, says one year ago it was very chaotic compared to where they are at now. Still much work to do, but improvements were made. (think he means it went from an D- to like a C.)</p>\n\n<p>- interesting he claims Russia&#39;s command and tactical ability has degraded, says they were much better organized during last years Kherson offensive. Says they are defending, but they are very chaotic and jittery and lack organization. Could lead to a major rout. The russian southern and western defenses may collapse. Says the clock is ticking for Russia to move to the pre 2012 lines where they would be better suited for defensive operations.</p>\n\n<p>-says russians are taking immense casualties in klischiveevka village, they have no need to advance 3km to quantify results on a map, but they are hammering everyone who enters. </p>\n\n<p>-cluster munition has made the first phase operations much longer which he says is a good thing because phase 2 will be a lot less costly on human lives.

        "body": "Just reposting my comment from late yesterday regarding ECOWAS background and its potential intervention in Niger.\n\nECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States) was founded via the Lagos Treaty of 1975. It initially contained fifteen members, essentially the entirety of what is generally considered to be West Africa. The organization has three official languages (English, French, and Portuguese) reflecting its members' colonial history and general diversity. Originally, the organization was aimed at joint economic development in the post-colonial world, but in 1993 the founding treaty was refined and their mandate expanded somewhat to \"collective self-sufficiency\" with the primary focus remaining economic coordination and development. Specifically, the refined goals are as follows:  \n\n\n*the harmonization and co-ordination of national policies and the promotion of integration programmes, projects and activities, particularly in food, agriculture and natural resources, industry, transport and communications, energy, trade, money and finance, taxation, economic reform policies, human resources, education, information, culture, science, technology, services, health, tourism, legal matters;the harmonization and co-ordination of policies for the protection of the environment;*  \n\n\n*the promotion of the establishment of joint production enterprises;*  \n\n\n*the establishment of a common market;the establishment of an economic union through the adoption of common policies in the economic, financial, social and cultural sectors, and the creation of a monetary union.*  \n\n\n*the promotion of joint ventures by private sector enterprises and other economic operators, in particular through the adoption of a regional agreement on cross border investments;the adoption of measures for the integration of the private sectors, particularly the creation of an enabling environment to promote small and medium scale enterprises;*  \n\n\n*the establishment of an enabling legal environment;*  \n\n\n*the harmonisation of national investment codes leading to the adoption of a single Community investment code;*  \n\n\n*the harmonization of standards and measures;the promotion of balanced development of the region, paying attention to the special problems of each Member State particularly those of landlocked and small island Member States;*  \n\n\n*the encouragement and strengthening of relations and the promotion of the flow of information particularly among rural populations, women and youth organizations and socio-professional organizations such as associations of the media, business men and women, workers, and trade unions;*  \n\n\n*the adoption of a Community population policy which takes into account the need for a balance between demographic factors and socio-economic development;*  \n\n\n*any other activity that Member States may decide to undertake jointly with a view to attaining Community objectives.*  \n\n\nPersonally, I would rate as one of the more successful multilateral African institutions, thanks largely to its continued longevity and economic successes. It is a fully developed organization consisting of a number of institutions and sub-institutions, ranging across the board to cover its goals. The driving control iof ECOWAS comes from the Authority of the Heads of State, a council of all the member heads of state. This council is led on a rotating, yearly basis by one head of state elected from among the group. It is really this body that sets the agenda for the rest of the organization. The current Chairman is Bola Ahmed Adekunle Tinubu, the current President of Nigeria, which also happens to be ECOWAS' largest and most powerful member.  \n\n\nIn terms of membership, though ECOWAS currently consists of 15 states, the numbers and specific states have shifted since 1975. Cape Verde joined in 1977, Mauritania withdrew in 2000 (though regained associate membership in 2017 iirc), and Morocco has petitioned for membership (going nowhere). The most recent membership issues, however, have sprung from what is one fo the major crises of ECOWAS in the post-Cold War era: mitigating and preventing coups. In 2021, ECOWAS suspended Mali's membership due to a coup. Shortly thereafter in the same year, ECOWAS also suspended Guinea's membership for the same reason. Then, in 2022, they did the same thing to Burkina Faso. However, these responses, while potentially damaging, are far less dramatic and punitive than the earlier interventions the organization launched.  \n\n\nIn the early 1990s, anglophone ECOWAS members established ECOMOG (Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group) as a multilateral task force to intervene in the Liberian civil war despite strenuous objections from mostly francophone members. Despite limited support from the United States, mostly in the form of logistics, ECOMOG had a mixed track record as an enforcement arm for stability in the region. It was plagued primarily with corruption and ill-discipline and since its main force was almost entirely Nigerian, it relied on that country's good graces as well. It eventually withdrew from Liberia, but was deployed again to Guinea Bissau and Sierra Leone in the late 90s (again with limited success). Largely at the prompting of the US, a second multilateral peacekeeping task force, ECOMIL (ECOWAS mission in Liberia) was deployed to Liberia in 2003 but shortly thereafter handed over operations to a UN mission, UNMIL. They also intervened with smaller forces in Guinea-Bissau in 2012 and Mali in 2013 (which was mostly France's show). The most recent intervention, as another poster mentioned, was in 2017 and was a large force of nearly 8,000 soldiers, primarily from Senegal with support from Nigeria. That intervention was largely successful, with very minimal violence and the resumption of proper governance in The Gambia, though the stabilization portion of the mission is still ongoing.  \n\n\nAs for the current threat, it is hard to say exactly how credible it is. ECOWAS response to coups in recent years has, as I mentioned, been tepid at best. That said, the threat is not idle. ECOWAS could quite conceivably launch a large-scale intervention into Niger to reassert governmental authority and oust the puschists. They could genuinely do this of their own accord and with their own internalized resources, but I think it's fairly likely they could call on either French or US support, almost certainly in the forms of logistics, if they chose to follow that route. Both France and the US have troops stationed in Niger, as well as a vested interest in maintaining a strong, friendly democratic government there. For France, it is both an issue of maintaining/support its post-colonial obligations and economic sphere. For the US, it's largely about preserving a base of operations for efforts to combat terrorist activities in Western Africa and also pushing back against potential Chinese and/or Russia influence in the region. Nigeria, ECOWAS' most powerful member and current overall leader, has its own issues with terrorism and instability and shares an extensive land border with Niger. As such, it has an almost certain vested interest in maintaining Nigerien stability. In fact, compared to previous ECOWAS interventions, this potential situation is the one that most directly impacts Nigeria and in the largest way. It has never had an ECOWAS crisis dropped on its doorstep and it therefore may push for an largely unilateral intervention with the organization's backing.  \n\n\nAll that being said, ECOWAS also has a track record of facilitating negotiations and diplomatic solutions to potential conflicts. I imagine that they will attempt to push that angle first before stepping towards an actual intervention. After the succession of coups since 2020, the ECOWAS leaders must be starting to feel a little concerned, and if Niger, which is relatively stable as African states go (or at least has been stable in recent years) can go like this, they all have to be a little unnerved. As such, very much not outside the realm of possibility to see them move away from the tepid responses here and finally put a foot down/set an example that they will no longer be tolerating such overthrows within the region. Given what I mentioned above re: the French and Americans, ECOWAS might also feel more international pressure to act than it did in the case of Guinea or Burkina Faso. On the overall scale of very unlikely to very likely, I would personally rate an ECOWAS intervention force at the end of their seven-day ultimatum as somewhat likely. IMO there is not a significant amount of evidence to support that the coup has broad strokes popular support among the Nigerien people and as one of ECOWAS largest members, both by population and geographical area, I think it behooves ECOWAS to act more so than they have in the past.",

We are comparing the same rich or poor country when they have higher, lower, or negative inflation (expectations) and how that affects the consumption.

In recent news, while the JF17 seemed to be a promising option, it appears that the F16 is now the favored bid, and a final purchase agreement might be reached soon.\n\nHowever, the US is not doing too great in their APC bid. The US had offered Argentina a large batch of Strykers, but faced hard competition due to the fact that the Stryker does not meet the country's armament and amphibious capability requirements. The other two countries involved were Brazil, with their Guaran\u00ed 6x6, and China, with the VN1, an export version of the ZBL08. Not long ago, the brazilian offer seemed to be the imminent winner, but in a twist Brazil declared this past week that it will rescind its bid until Argentina proves it is able to pay for the contract.\n\nFor now it seems that the Chinese offer will be favored, as aside from possessing all technical requirements requested (unlike the Stryker), China offers to set up manufacturing plants in the country, as well as offer alternative options for payment, such as payment in commodities. Remember that China is one of Argentina's largest commercial partners, owing to the country's vast exports of soy beans (and the unofficial but still prevalent ecocide China is waging on Argentine maritime wildlife with their illegal fishing superfleets)\n\n[India's HAL also just made an offer for light and attack helicopters](https://www.zona-militar.com/2023/07/21/cuales-son-los-helicopteros-que-argentina-quiere-adquirir-a-la-india/). A few \"intention letters\" have been signed teasing a contract but as it always happens, signing a letter is free, paying up for the hardware is not.\n\nBeing Argentine myself, I feel the country is playing with fire in dealing with China. While it is true that their hardware fits the country's needs well, and the financing options are generous, Argentina is still, at the end of the day, a major non-NATO ally of the US, and that bridge should not be burned. Recently that relationship has been strained by China's \"totally not a military base\" military base in Argentina, and going all in on China's hardware will only make things worse.",

Each small step Argentina steps closer to China and away from the US seems small in isolation but add them up and before you know it, the country becomes another Chinese province. This is bad for the US, of course, but I also believe it is bad for Argentina.

Sensing an opportunity and with their contract up for negotiation, the Steel Workers union demanded better wages and naturally the management of several steel firms refused to accommodate the demands. A strike was threatened. The White House feared that a strike would actually reduce steel production during this crucial time, and so tried to intervene by nationalizing several steel producing firms with the goal being to force the union into a contract (my understanding, tho I could be misremembering, is that this would have been a pro-management contract fwiw). This was opposed by the firms, and the whole thing went to the SCOTUS. The basic point of dispute ended up revolving around the president's ability to do these kinds of things. The SCOTUS ultimately decided that the executive did not have the power to nationalize industries and could not use broadly defined wartime powers to seize private property. But Congress *could* order the president to seize private property as long as it was targeted and not generalized. So Congress could have passed a law authorizing Truman to nationalize the factories, but it hadn't so he couldn't force it with some broader mandate for wartime central planning. \n\nMusk plays a dangerous game, because while hes protected from unilateral action from the executive/DoD hes still vulnerable in a lot of ways. The nuclear option would be Congress authorizing the president to nationalize Starlink. Given how the US works this would likely not be to keep the business public, but to nationalize it and resell it to a more compliant ownership group (I hear those Northrop guys are just cracker jack). This would be painful, but worth doing if there is a serious national security concern and no way to remedy it outside of Congress and (inevitably) the courts. But there are a ton of other ways that the DoD could blow Starlink up and place it under a ton of pressure without having to actually publically and formally strip Musk of ownership. The most simple would be to simply build a parallel system controlled by aforementioned compliant trusted source. The USMIC can really work wonders when big bags of cash are on the table, and nothing Starlink has done is so crazy as to be unrepeatable. News is a Taiwanese company is also looking to create its own competitor to Starlink, giving the DoD potentially two alternatives in developing its own system. And of course the DoD can also cancel Starlink's contracts, which wouldn't help Ukraine but it would really fuck over Starlink who I'm guessing really depends right now on those military contracts and US tax payer funded R&D to refine its consumer products. If theyre playing the game right, Stalink should be using its money from Ukraine to subsidize penetration into the US domestic internet market by producing more, cheaper terminals and getting them into the hands of those who want them. Shutting that money off may well be enough to put pressure on the Starlink board to take control away from Musk. Or thats the hope, my understanding is Musk has insulated himself by appointing boards filled with Yes-men, so probably there wont be any convincing them to give Musk the heave ho. \n\nBut the other big pain point would be in cutting non-Starlink contracts. If Musk's unreliability pushes the DoD back to NASA, or one of the traditional MICs, or someone like Blue Origin the loss would really hurt Space-X in the long run, especially if the lease on USG owned facilities like Wallops Island were canceled. People say that Space-X does stuff nobody else can, which is true in the commercial sense. But when you have that fuck you USAF money cost is not an issue especially if it means developing a viable alternative to an unreliable business partner. Part of the reason why Lockheed and Boeing have become Lockheed and Boeing is that they are predictable, play by the book, and dont get in bed with strategic rivals. Musk plays with fire by proving why its better to trust the good old boys with your juicy defense contracts, rather than take bets on the guy who leads the market by five years. Is Starlink or Space X really doing something Lockheed couldn't do in five years? If you gave them enough money? This is the *exact opposite* question Musk should want the USG to be asking.",

        "body": "There are occasional videos of Ukrainian forces blowing up Buk and other air defense systems on the Russian side. These are \"high-value targets\" in an abstract sense, but could someone explain the practical military benefits Ukraine is likely to get by destroying them? \n\nFrom everything I've read (including the leaked docs), Russia's supply of GBAD is for practical intents and purposes limitless, and has been attritted to a far lesser extent than their tanks or even their artillery. So it seems unlikely to have a strategic effect unless the attrition rate goes up by orders of magnitude. \n\nAnd for tactical effects... would it lead to reduced losses of Ukrainian aircraft, or let them operate any more freely? They've been forced to operate in an incredibly risk averse manner, IIRC tens of kilometers behind the front. I would guess their loss rates are already near zero (because they can't afford any), and that even if one air defense unit is taken out, there are plenty of others around, *plus* MiG-31 at high altitude, so I don't see how it would necessarily make a difference. What about drones - are Buks and similar medium/long-range systems even used against those, that is, the kinds Ukraine operates near the front?

These are &quot;high-value targets&quot; in an abstract sense, but could someone explain the practical military benefits Ukraine is likely to get by destroying them? </p>\n\n<p>From everything I&#39;ve read (including the leaked docs), Russia&#39;s supply of GBAD is for practical intents and purposes limitless, and has been attritted to a far lesser extent than their tanks or even their artillery. So it seems unlikely to have a strategic effect unless the attrition rate goes up by orders of magnitude. </p>\n\n<p>And for tactical effects... would it lead to reduced losses of Ukrainian aircraft, or let them operate any more freely? They&#39;ve been forced to operate in an incredibly risk averse manner, IIRC tens of kilometers behind the front. I would guess their loss rates are already near zero (because they can&#39;t afford any), and that even if one air defense unit is taken out, there are plenty of others around, <em>plus</em> MiG-31 at high altitude, so I don&#39;t see how it would necessarily make a difference. What about drones - are Buks and similar medium/long-range systems even used against those, that is, the kinds Ukraine operates near the front?

One of the issues with this is that they're heavy on staff at the higher levels, light at the lower levels. I'm not exactly sure if they're as weak as the Russians are at the battalion level (which was one reason the Russians had issues with the BTG concept), but the Ukrainians can't be heavy on staff at the battalion level because they just don't have the spare officers.

As so many are quick to point out the miraculous transformation of the UAF post 2014 (it was more 2018 and after), many of the officers they're now reliant on for command and staff are NOT those officers, they're more likely the ones who served during the dark times following the collapse of the Soviet Union when the UAF was probably the worst military in Europe.",

Japan plans to acquire 400 TLAMs, and there are rumors that TLAM production rate will increase six-fold. Additionally, the US will procure 300 ESSM Block II upgrade kits. The upgrade kits consist of the missile front end, which is the expensive part. \n\nThe US produces more naval missiles and upgrade kits than China's VLS growth. Not only that, but it's not unusual for a VLS to be partially full; there's nothing weird about it. As I've said in my other posts, the US had a substantial latent missile production capacity that China cannot match. That's how we're seeing a 20% year-on-year increase in some production rates. We're coming out of GWOT and just getting started with our missile capacity buildout. \n\nNon-naval missile production is also quite high. The US will produce 550 PAC-3 MSEs in 2023. Remember, the US is more reliant on its airforce than any other military. We produce hundreds of AMRAAMs and hundreds of Sidewinders per year. IIRC, the US plans to acquire 300 AARGM-ERs per year. \n\nLast, I posted the INDOPACOM PLARF ballistic missile net acquisition estimates. ~185 per year. Even if we account for missile expenditure, that comes nowhere close to the production rates of US long-range missiles. \n\nIt's not close. The US outproduces the PLA, and the gap will likely grow.

Critics like to argue around various grey areas like the invasion of Irak and there is some merit to their arguments but public perception is nonetheless largely sympathetic to this view. Admitting a member that is engaged in a war with one of NATO's near peers in order to force a favourable settlement would likely damage this favourable view. I think even the most realist (politically/ethically speaking) defenders of NATO involvement would be a little troubled by this perspective. I certainly would be, and I'm among the demented warmongers who think NATO policy should be harsher, stronger, and more proactive.\n\nAs for the latter: even the earliest formal theories of warfare acknowledged one way or another that warfare is a means of achieving some political goals -- that relationship goes both ways but it's this one that's particularly relevant. In this case, the two major Russian political goals were a) bringing Ukraine back under Russia's sphere of influence and b) blocking further NATO expansion, especially towards the East, by preemptively expanding the Russian sphere of influence over Ukraine and possibly turning that into a policy, rather than an occasional decision.\n\nDoctrinally, war against the NATO block would probably involve immediate and ample mobilization of military and economic resources, but the Russian government could not do anything of that sort for a war against Ukraine. It would have been politically risky and intelligence available to them at the time suggested it would be entirely unnecessary -- the latter, as we know, was a major failure, but it's probably still fair to say that whatever elements of the Russian military apparatus participated in the initial planning were not wrong to think opposing Ukraine would probably take fewer resources than opposing all of NATO. At the very least nukes aren't being flung around yet.\n\nFurthermore, in a somewhat surprising continuation of Soviet policy, the Russian political establishment has used the perceived outside threat of military action, subversive action and economical encroachment from outside actors as a valuable political tool. I'm calling them \"outside actors\" because the terms used by the Russian government were routinely non-specific,  like \"the collective West\", both in order to avoid subverting their own parallel ideological campaigns (like the idea that fractures within the Western societies and among Western countries would lead to their inaction and collapse) and in order to avoid damaging their otherwise lucrative economic ties with, and personal privilleges granted by, Western enterprises.\n\nSo far, one of Russia's chief difficulties in this war has been its failure to strongly mobilise substantial blocks of its society and economic sectors. Even though approval of the war has generally been pretty broad, the Russian establishment has failed to achieve the kind of mobilisation that the Soviet Union managed to achieve during the Great Patriotic War, or possibly even at the height of the Sino-Soviet crisis. And, in the medium/long-term, it's unclear if the Russian establishment has managed to secure widespread political support in its government and legislative institutions.\n\nBoth of these challenges have been caused, in part, by the obvious fracture between the Russian government's public messaging and real damn life. There was no danger of an imminent NATO attack, no Nazi government in Kyiv, and with Ukraine locked in a frozen war in Donbas it was extremely unlikely that Ukraine would've been anywhere close to joining NATO.\n\nUkraine *actually joining NATO* during the war would vindicate pretty much all of these points (in Russian parlance, it would likely vindicate even the one about Nazis in Kyiv, ridiculous though it might be). This could very well allow the Russian political establishment the means to mobilize their society, and to secure political support well enough to, if not actually start World War III over Zaporizhzhia, at least pose a more significant threat to NATO in the long run.\n\nWhich, I think, requires one to acknowledge a third point, that while it's likely that Ukraine joining NATO would be in Ukraine's immediate interest at any moment, including this one, it's not immediately clear that Ukraine joining NATO *now*, as opposed to after a peace, would be in the interest of current NATO members, at least not given the current NATO policy towards Russia, and not in the current security climate. I personally suspect it could be shaped in that direction but, alas, it's not.
