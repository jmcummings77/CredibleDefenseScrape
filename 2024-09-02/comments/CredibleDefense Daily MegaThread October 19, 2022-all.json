I'm simply correcting the record: i.e. the report was based almost entirely on activity that happened in a ~7-week period, that it didn't involve 100,000 Russian soldiers, that it didn't involve 40 million Ukrainians, that it didn't involve the biggest chunks of land that the Russians have taken. Those are statements of facts. They come with no attached interpretation or end conclusion. \n\n> Accusations of war crimes are EXTREMELY serious, making false accusations is very damaging to the overall cause, same as other sex crime issues.\n\nAnd I never made any accusations, nor have I ever said something is an established conclusion. I was, once again, correcting the record on what we're discussing, so we all start our conversations from the same baseline. Your scope and the investigation's scope are not at all in the same ballpark. \n\n> As I've been saying on this sub for months, THIS ISN'T THE FIRST WAR THAT EVER OCCURRED. There is precedent for those war crimes because mass rape as strategic policy has happened before, and those have set the bar. People have literally been tried and executed over this topic, there is case law on this topic. The whole reason she holds that job is because it's happened before to the point a UN Security Council resolution was passed to fight it.\n\nThen please provide this bar of reasonable evidence. I am not aware of it. This isn't a gotcha, but a simple request for additional information. I am totally amenable to changing my mind. \n\n> Also, declaring something is \"war strategy\" is to declare it policy originating at the strategic level, because strategy means something in the context of military ops and warfare at large. Strategic level is top military brass running the war and civilian national leadership.\n\nAnd one could argue that if there are indeed multiple provable non-related incidents where soldiers have been provided with Viagra, when there are multiple reports that Russian soldiers aren't even receiving MREs, then that could clearly be argued as a strategic objective. My point to you is that neither you nor I are qualified enough to make those calls. \n\n> Applying to all Russians in this case, who possess upwards of hundreds of thousands of troops in Ukraine in the last eight months, have occupied up to 20% of it, and have been driven out of four entire oblasts the Ukrainians have retaken, and still no evidence of systematic mass rape that was made policy\n\nAgain, you're stretching the scope of what the investigation was about, and thus the burden of proof. I don't know what the requisite rapes per capita is, but if you make the per capita number larger, you're obviously indirectly arguing that we need to have seen more rapes for the atrocities to reach whatever threshold you've deemed necessary. I'd further argue that the sheer **number** of rapes is just one criterion. The intentions of the acts, their cruelty, whether they are recorded for dissemination, etc. etc. could also factor in. I'm simply not smart enough to know. \n\n> She's a lawyer, she knows the value of words and bombastic language, it's her job to manipulate both, it's literally a lawyer's job.\n\nYou're a former grunt. All grunts are idiots that lack any ability to understand nuance and critical thinking skills. See how $hitty of a stereotype that is? It's obviously not a fair assumption, and no one should judge you based on that.

Most likely, the environment will continue.\n\n>On October 18, the acting head of the Kherson region Vladimir Saldo announced the evacuation of the population to the left bank of the Dnieper. Berislavsky, Belozersky, Snigirevsky and Alexandrovsky municipalities fall under organized displacement. According to him, there is an immediate danger of flooding the territory due to the possible destruction of the Kakhovskaya HPP dam and the discharge of water from the cascade of power plants upstream of the Dnieper.\n\n>Also on October 19, Saldo announced the closure of entry to the Kherson region for civilians for the next seven days.\n\n>Our team believes that for Russian forces, the explosion of the dam will be unprofitable (based on the terrain, we can assume that the territories occupied by Russian troops will be affected first of all), and the Ukrainian forces do not have such an opportunity.\n\n>Russian Army Commander Sergei Surovikin said that further actions against Kherson will depend on the current military-tactical situation, \"easy decisions are not excluded.\" Surovikin also added that strikes on military and civilian Ukrainian infrastructure reduce the combat capability of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. We do not know how power outages in electricity and water supply in Kiev can affect the combat capability of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on the front line.\n\n>In pro-Russian sources, Surovikin's statement caused some enthusiasm.

Most likely, the environment will continue.</p>\n\n<p>On October 18, the acting head of the Kherson region Vladimir Saldo announced the evacuation of the population to the left bank of the Dnieper. Berislavsky, Belozersky, Snigirevsky and Alexandrovsky municipalities fall under organized displacement. According to him, there is an immediate danger of flooding the territory due to the possible destruction of the Kakhovskaya HPP dam and the discharge of water from the cascade of power plants upstream of the Dnieper.</p>\n\n<p>Also on October 19, Saldo announced the closure of entry to the Kherson region for civilians for the next seven days.</p>\n\n<p>Our team believes that for Russian forces, the explosion of the dam will be unprofitable (based on the terrain, we can assume that the territories occupied by Russian troops will be affected first of all), and the Ukrainian forces do not have such an opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>Russian Army Commander Sergei Surovikin said that further actions against Kherson will depend on the current military-tactical situation, &quot;easy decisions are not excluded.&quot; Surovikin also added that strikes on military and civilian Ukrainian infrastructure reduce the combat capability of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. We do not know how power outages in electricity and water supply in Kiev can affect the combat capability of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on the front line.</p>\n\n<p>In pro-Russian sources, Surovikin&#39;s statement caused some enthusiasm. WarGonzo believes that Surovikin&#39;s increased popularity is due to the high public demand for truthful information.</p>\n\n<p>The head of the Nikolaev OVA Vitaly Kim believes that Russian statements about possible departure and complex decisions are part of an information and psychological attack.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On October 18, Russian forces again shelled Ukrainian cities:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the Dnieper, the CHPP was attacked, and light was lost in some communities of the region.\nIn Kiev, they hit CHPP-6, which caused water and electricity outages in the city.

You could help alot already by teaching your own kids to study broadly, speak less, listen more and entertain ideas from people they may not agree with.\n\nIf you or anyone took a stroll through my posting history, you might find that I seem staunch in my beliefs, but they became that way because people on this sub frequently taught me things I hadn't considered or was hard to swallow and it force me to reevaluate my beliefs. Even now as I am confident of my beliefs, I still regularly visit subs Whose content I fundamentally do not agree with. Some problems thers bring up are things that I myself wasnt able to see at first. I might not agree either their solutions about it, but its added to my knowledge and played into my considerations for my own beliefs now.\n\nTheres a lot you can do as a civilian and even though the military and the associated military industrial complex does research and actualized a lot of this tech, the basis of this tech is more often than not discovered and worked on at your nearby state school. You can help out in many ways but you just have to get creative. I will say- talking to people outside of this sub can be terribly draining and distressing be cause they arent going to have the knowledge about things that people on this sub will.

You could help alot already by teaching your own kids to study broadly, speak less, listen more and entertain ideas from people they may not agree with.</p>\n\n<p>If you or anyone took a stroll through my posting history, you might find that I seem staunch in my beliefs, but they became that way because people on this sub frequently taught me things I hadn&#39;t considered or was hard to swallow and it force me to reevaluate my beliefs. Even now as I am confident of my beliefs, I still regularly visit subs Whose content I fundamentally do not agree with. Some problems thers bring up are things that I myself wasnt able to see at first. I might not agree either their solutions about it, but its added to my knowledge and played into my considerations for my own beliefs now.</p>\n\n<p>Theres a lot you can do as a civilian and even though the military and the associated military industrial complex does research and actualized a lot of this tech, the basis of this tech is more often than not discovered and worked on at your nearby state school. You can help out in many ways but you just have to get creative. I will say- talking to people outside of this sub can be terribly draining and distressing be cause they arent going to have the knowledge about things that people on this sub will. It ain&#39;t much though but its honest work.</p>\n</div>",

                                    "body": "You are correct, overhead electrification is a significant capital investment on the part of the rail operator. Where you are mistaken is with the actual operating cost compared to diesel fuel. Electric systems are cheaper per ton mile to operate than diesel networks are due to the substantial increase in transmission efficiency, regenerative braking and improved reliability of the locomotives themselves. Operating costs are reduced by as much as 50% compared to diesel counterparts, and maintenance expenditure is reduced by 25-30%. Its just simple physics that dictates solid state electrical hardware will not be subject to the same wear and maintenance requirements as an internal combustion engine. Electrical systems are a significant up-front investment in exchange for massive cost savings in operation.  \n  \nDiesel may have fantastic energy density, but this is a negligible benefit when you can constantly feed energy into the vehicle while in motion. Diesel is well suited to heavy construction machinery, ships and trucks because their routes are not fixed and cannot have a stable source of power provided along their entire route, but you would be hard pressed to take a train off the tracks. The power density of the fuel doesn't matter if you never leave the gas pump.  \n  \nYou're taking a very US-centric view of rail transportation, and yes the US does move almost all of its freight by diesel locomotive.

Rail electrification has come up many times for every railroad in North America, always timed with an increase in diesel prices. The early 60s saw Union Pacific and Southern Pacific putting substantial research into electrifying the Rocky Mountain crossing routes due to long tunnels and prolonged steep grades, which electrical traction is well suited for. The oil crisis of the 1970s very nearly spurred the federal government to fully electrify the US rail network, but the assumption that low fuel prices would return meant the investment was deemed too expensive by the Nixon administration. Russia and its predecessor the USSR make an excellent point of comparison to the US as both nations have a relatively low population density and plentiful natural resources.

Israel won it's most pivotal wars with little to no US aid, namely it's war of independence and 1967 war. By 1973 Israel had nukes, the prospect of full military defeat was eliminated.

But I will, if you're willing to debate in good faith. My post history will show you that I'm not in any way shape or form hostile to Israel and its self-preservation, no matter how much your repeated personal insults may insinuate I am. Here, have a gander:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/y220lp/credibledefense_daily_megathread_october_12_2022/is2pdex/\n\n> I guess you argued that India too should put Ukraine's interests above Indian interests and were answered with the same, the obligation of the Indian state is to Indians, not Ukrainians. And he was correct if he said so.\n\nYou keep making this a strawman that you'd rather argue with, which I'm again, not interested in. Never once have I said that any country should put another country's interests above another's. I've argued that supporting Ukraine **is** in the best interest of both Israel and India. You may disagree with that. Fine. In my very OP, I said that perhaps Israel's position is justifiable. \n\n> I honestly don't understand where this entitlement that everyone should sacrifice themselves to aid in the Ukrainian war effort coming from. Ukraine is fighting a just war and I hope that they'll win, but I'm not willing to get bombed for it with Russian arms as a retaliation for support.\n\nAnd I'm saying that that assessment seems wrong. For example, you claimed that Russia's support to Israel would come in the form of S-300 and S-400 systems. Well, guess what: they're already behind schedule for their delivery of those weapon systems to India. If they can't supply their biggest import partner outside of China and most critical weapons customer, do you really think they'll provide Syria with S-300s? And do you really think Israel can't make light work of those systems? Further, Israel has the capacity to out-escalate Russia any day of the year. All the Ukrainians are asking for is defensive weapons to protect civilians. Israel can go well and beyond that if Russia were to escalate in Syria. In terms of more AD to Iran, what makes you believe that Russia wouldn't be doing that as part of the ballistic missiles trade with Iran? If Russia can spare it, they'll send those systems to Iran regardless of Israel does at the moment. Do you believe there's a backchannel agreement between the Russians and Israelis? \n\n> Turkey is not under existential threat, Israel is. Turkey's enemy are a few disorganized militias. Israel's enemies are a regional power, and several states worth of support. Turkey is in NATO. Turkey has a population 8.5 times that of Israel. Turkey holds access to the Black sea. You're not arguing in good faith if you think that the two are in any way under similar threat.\n\nThere are no perfect analogies in life. I've already pointed out Finland and Sweden to you to show you that NATO involvement isn't what's necessary for Western support. Israel will get every support it will from the U.S., at the least, to keep Iran in check and to prevent a proliferation of the war in the ME, NATO or not. Further, you could argue that outside of Iran, who is hostile to Turkey as well, both countries face very similar geopolitical balancing acts. Turkey's population advantage is blunted by Israel's own nuclear bombs, while Turkey is held in check by the U.S. \n\n> I have no idea what makes you think that the dangers to Israel are not grave and real.\n\nI said I don't believe supporting Ukraine with AD makes Israel's dangers any worse. You've not given me any reason to change my mind on that. \n\n>  Israel won it's most pivotal wars with little to no US aid, namely it's war of independence and 1967 war. \n\n\nWell, hello, revisionism, my old friend. Let's forget QME and the massive amount of economic aid that the U.S. supplied Israel with. Even during the pre-1973 period, especially during the 50s and 60s, the aid that was flowing to Israel wasn't inconsequential relative to Israel's GDP at the time. And even if you want to ignore U.S. interests, what about your old friends the French? You know, the ones that helped you develop your nukes. They are aligned with the U.S. in this war, so what about helping them out? \n\n> US did try to forge ties with the enemies of Israel, but they turned to the USSR instead. The only one that did not was Jordan. Only after Israel soundly won the 1967 war, and with the rest of the Arab states aside from the Gulf turning to the USSR, Israel was literally the only horse left for the US.\n\nThis is, again, historical revisionism. If you take Egypt, as an example, after 52, Egypt approached the U.S. and France for aid repeatedly, but was turned down largely due to self-interest, but also because of a secondary aim to support Israel. The Saudi's were never in the Soviet's sphere of influence, but many scholars have argued that the U.S. influence in Saudi could have been a lot stronger were it not for the U.S.'s support for Israel. \n\n> Who are those other allies?

But I will, if you&#39;re willing to debate in good faith. My post history will show you that I&#39;m not in any way shape or form hostile to Israel and its self-preservation, no matter how much your repeated personal insults may insinuate I am. Here, have a gander:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/y220lp/credibledefense_daily_megathread_october_12_2022/is2pdex/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/y220lp/credibledefense_daily_megathread_october_12_2022/is2pdex/</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I guess you argued that India too should put Ukraine&#39;s interests above Indian interests and were answered with the same, the obligation of the Indian state is to Indians, not Ukrainians. And he was correct if he said so.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You keep making this a strawman that you&#39;d rather argue with, which I&#39;m again, not interested in. Never once have I said that any country should put another country&#39;s interests above another&#39;s. I&#39;ve argued that supporting Ukraine <strong>is</strong> in the best interest of both Israel and India. You may disagree with that. Fine. In my very OP, I said that perhaps Israel&#39;s position is justifiable. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I honestly don&#39;t understand where this entitlement that everyone should sacrifice themselves to aid in the Ukrainian war effort coming from. Ukraine is fighting a just war and I hope that they&#39;ll win, but I&#39;m not willing to get bombed for it with Russian arms as a retaliation for support.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And I&#39;m saying that that assessment seems wrong. For example, you claimed that Russia&#39;s support to Israel would come in the form of S-300 and S-400 systems. Well, guess what: they&#39;re already behind schedule for their delivery of those weapon systems to India. If they can&#39;t supply their biggest import partner outside of China and most critical weapons customer, do you really think they&#39;ll provide Syria with S-300s? And do you really think Israel can&#39;t make light work of those systems? Further, Israel has the capacity to out-escalate Russia any day of the year. All the Ukrainians are asking for is defensive weapons to protect civilians. Israel can go well and beyond that if Russia were to escalate in Syria. In terms of more AD to Iran, what makes you believe that Russia wouldn&#39;t be doing that as part of the ballistic missiles trade with Iran? If Russia can spare it, they&#39;ll send those systems to Iran regardless of Israel does at the moment. Do you believe there&#39;s a backchannel agreement between the Russians and Israelis? </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Turkey is not under existential threat, Israel is. Turkey&#39;s enemy are a few disorganized militias. Israel&#39;s enemies are a regional power, and several states worth of support. Turkey is in NATO. Turkey has a population 8.5 times that of Israel. Turkey holds access to the Black sea. You&#39;re not arguing in good faith if you think that the two are in any way under similar threat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are no perfect analogies in life. I&#39;ve already pointed out Finland and Sweden to you to show you that NATO involvement isn&#39;t what&#39;s necessary for Western support. Israel will get every support it will from the U.S., at the least, to keep Iran in check and to prevent a proliferation of the war in the ME, NATO or not. Further, you could argue that outside of Iran, who is hostile to Turkey as well, both countries face very similar geopolitical balancing acts. Turkey&#39;s population advantage is blunted by Israel&#39;s own nuclear bombs, while Turkey is held in check by the U.S. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I have no idea what makes you think that the dangers to Israel are not grave and real.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I said I don&#39;t believe supporting Ukraine with AD makes Israel&#39;s dangers any worse. You&#39;ve not given me any reason to change my mind on that. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Israel won it&#39;s most pivotal wars with little to no US aid, namely it&#39;s war of independence and 1967 war. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Well, hello, revisionism, my old friend. Let&#39;s forget QME and the massive amount of economic aid that the U.S. supplied Israel with. Even during the pre-1973 period, especially during the 50s and 60s, the aid that was flowing to Israel wasn&#39;t inconsequential relative to Israel&#39;s GDP at the time. And even if you want to ignore U.S. interests, what about your old friends the French? You know, the ones that helped you develop your nukes. They are aligned with the U.S. in this war, so what about helping them out? </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>US did try to forge ties with the enemies of Israel, but they turned to the USSR instead. The only one that did not was Jordan. Only after Israel soundly won the 1967 war, and with the rest of the Arab states aside from the Gulf turning to the USSR, Israel was literally the only horse left for the US.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is, again, historical revisionism. If you take Egypt, as an example, after 52, Egypt approached the U.S. and France for aid repeatedly, but was turned down largely due to self-interest, but also because of a secondary aim to support Israel. The Saudi&#39;s were never in the Soviet&#39;s sphere of influence, but many scholars have argued that the U.S. influence in Saudi could have been a lot stronger were it not for the U.S.&#39;s support for Israel. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Who are those other allies? Iran which wants nothing less than the destruction of the US, and has spit on every American attempt of reconciliation? </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Nonsense. The U.S. annulled the rehabilitation of U.S.-Iranian relations with Trump, not the Iranians. You know better than that.</p>\n</div>",

And it's also stunning how you completely ignored that the only reason the U.S. was \"openly courting Egypt with aid\" was because that aid was **contingent** on an Arab-Israeli settlement, and the reason Nasser didn't take the aid was because he didn't want to make peace with Israel until the Suez issue was resolved, and the U.S. wouldn't release said aid until he did.

In reality between 1949-1967 US aid was under 1% of Israeli GDP.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Further, as you&#39;ve acknowledged, the U.S. hasn&#39;t sent more aid to any other country than Israel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Completely false. The US was sending greater aid to Jordan in the relevant period.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Once again, Israel wouldn&#39;t exist in its current form, whether economically, militarily, or geographically, without that aid. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Less than 1% of GDP in aid does that? Your statement have long passed the threshold of good faith.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Okay, if you actually believe Iran was the one that torpedoed the nuclear deal, and thus bilateral relations between the two, then okay.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As tradition, strawman and bad faith. I never claimed Iran torpedoed the deal, they had no reason to as it gave them the moon and stars. I disputed your claim that the deal has shown an decline in anymosiity from Iran against the US.</p>\n</div>",

To steal some gas that is super-abundant everywhere and that US has anyway (being by far the largest producer in the world)?</p>\n\n<p>I just can&#39;t buy that putin and the russian analysts/military community was convinced that maybe in the future US could do this and that. They are incompetent but can&#39;t be so incompetent to think that someone would really invade them some time in the next 20 years. Come on, I just can&#39;t believe it.</p>\n\n<p>I can&#39;t believe there was even one single analyst in a million that said &quot;ok, that 45 us troops in lithuania that come there after we terrorized that country when we invaded ukraine in 2014 is the sign that the USA is ready to invade us&quot;. It&#39;s just so crazy and unbelievable.</p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t know who this guy is but to me it sounds like russian bullshits. Also, from what we know about the russian military power, how longer could a war between russia and USA last if they take a piece of ukraine? Probably the russian military would be annihilated in 2 weeks and 4 days instead of 2 weeks.</p>\n</div>",
