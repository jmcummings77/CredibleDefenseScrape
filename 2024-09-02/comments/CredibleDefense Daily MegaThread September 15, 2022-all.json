ATACMS have a range of up to 300 kilometers, or around 185 miles. The administration still believes providing those systems could be escalatory because they could be used to fire into Russia itself. Currently, the maximum range of US-provided weapons to Ukraine is around 49 miles.\n\n>\u201cIt\u2019s our assessment that they don\u2019t currently require ATACMS to service targets that are directly relevant to the current fight,\u201d Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl told reporters in late-August.\n\n>Last week, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin intimated the US position hasn\u2019t shifted. \u201cThe HIMARS, using the GMLRS rockets, have been extraordinary in terms of enabling the Ukrainians to service the targets that they need to service inside of Ukraine,\u201d Austin said in Prague on Friday, making no mention of ATACMS.\n\n>Since the beginning of the conflict in February, the Biden administration has taken an incremental approach to providing arms to Ukraine \u2013 in some cases, later agreeing to send weapons that earlier in the conflict would have been deemed far too escalatory. Its calculus has largely been based on avoiding systems that might be seen by Putin as too provocative, although those lines have moved over time and been criticized by some former officials as arbitrary.\n\n>Some US military officials also acknowledged that systems currently considered too escalatory \u2013 like F-16 jets, for example \u2013 might eventually be provided to Ukraine. But those sources cautioned that such a decision is likely far in the future and isn\u2019t linked to Ukraine\u2019s recent, but nascent, successes. And there are no indications that such discussions are underway now.\n\n>>**\u201cUkraine has made some progress, but there\u2019s still a very tough fight, and a tough fight ahead, so I think we also need to keep that in mind,\u201d** Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cI think it is reasonable over time to continue, as we have, that dialogue to hear what their needs are, to work with the international community.\u201d\n\n>US National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby echoed that, telling reporters that the US would likely announce additional military assistance to Ukraine in the coming days but declined to outline that aid in detail.\n\n>Another defense official told CNN on Tuesday that the longer-range equipment is likely still off the table for now **because Ukraine is \u201cstill in the sweet spot on HIMARS,\u201d** or High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems that the US and some of its allies provided to Ukraine over the summer. The munitions for those systems, provided by the US, are capable of using GPS-guidance to strike a target with precision some 40 miles away.\n\n>Ukrainian forces have received \u201cthousands\u201d of GMLRS rounds, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark Milley said last week, and used them to strike Russian ammo depots, logistical hubs and command posts.\n\n>Still, some lawmakers disagree with the administration\u2019s cautious approach.\n\n>Asked whether he believes the US should send the ATACMS, **Republican Sen. Marco Rubio** of Florida told CNN, \u201cI think we should send them anything they need to reclaim their territory, to the extent that we have it available, and it is reasonable.\u201d\n\n>>\u201cI think the concern some would say is that the longer-range missiles could target deep inside of Russia and trigger a broader conflict. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m as troubled by that,\u201d Rubio added.\n\n>**US officials cautious on state of the war**\n\n>The US has also been careful not to call the rapid Ukrainian territorial gains a turning point in the war, or a critical moment that will decide the outcome for good.\n\n>\u201cIt\u2019s more important than ever that we don\u2019t appear to be spiking the ball,\u201d a defense official said. The Russians still have a tremendous amount of firepower, manpower and equipment in the fight in Ukraine, and the victories this month of the Ukrainian military have not sealed the outcome of the war. **In military terms, Russia still has \u201cmass,\u201d even if it has been unable to bring that to bear at a critical time and place to shape the outcome of a particular fight.**\n\n>Still, the **Ukrainian counteroffensive** \u2013 planned with US assistance \u2013 does appear to **have been \u201cexpertly executed,\u201d** the official said.\n\n>One thing that has changed in the last several months is the **Ukrainians\u2019 willingness to share intelligence with the US**, allowing American officials to better help the Ukrainians shape their battlefield operations.\n\n>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot more trust now than there was at the beginning of the war,\u201d said one Ukrainian source close to President Volodymyr Zelensky. \u201cAnd the Ukrainians recognize that the more they share, the more they are likely to get in return.\u201d\n\n>A US military source added that there has been \u201cdecent communication at varying levels about what\u2019s being planned on the political side and the military side. **There\u2019s pretty good military transparency.**\u201d\n\n>In Kherson, where Ukraine telegraphed its intentions for months before the counteroffensive began, Russia had time to prepare, digging in to protect the territory around one of the first cities they occupied early in the war. **Ukraine\u2019s advances there have been incremental and deliberate, one official said, and there is no rapid advance through collapsing Russian lines.**\n\n>Some analysts have described the Kherson offensive as a \u201cfixing\u201d operation designed to keep Russian troops engaged away from the fight in Kharkiv.\n\n>In Kharkiv, however, the attack caught the Russians by surprise and without any well-prepared defenses, allowing the Ukrainian military to rapidly reclaim thousands of square miles of territory.\n\n>**Russia has so far failed to meaningfully stop the counteroffensive in Ukraine\u2019s south or east** as the problems they had early in the war \u2013 supply line issues, logistical problems, and a lack of effective command and control \u2013 still plague the Russian military, officials said. Russia proved unable to hold the territory it had seized, partially because of the high cost imposed on them by Ukrainian defenders.\n\n>**The US is less concerned about Ukraine\u2019s ability to hold reclaimed territory**, officials said, even in the east, where Ukrainian forces have moved more than 60 kilometers within days in some cases. Ukraine\u2019s supply lines are internal, whereas Russia\u2019s were outside its own borders.\n\n>In addition, Ukraine\u2019s forces will get a significant boost to morale and will from the recent victories, one official said, while Russia\u2019s depleted forces will feel the opposite.\n\n>**It\u2019s \u201cnot a real concern of [Ukraine] overstretching supply lines,\u201d an official said**. Despite Russian claims of destroying the US-provided HIMARS, **all of the 16 systems remain accounted for and the \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of M777 howitzers also remain in operation, officials said**.",

The Russians still have a tremendous amount of firepower, manpower and equipment in the fight in Ukraine, and the victories this month of the Ukrainian military have not sealed the outcome of the war. <strong>In military terms, Russia still has \u201cmass,\u201d even if it has been unable to bring that to bear at a critical time and place to shape the outcome of a particular fight.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Still, the <strong>Ukrainian counteroffensive</strong> \u2013 planned with US assistance \u2013 does appear to <strong>have been \u201cexpertly executed,\u201d</strong> the official said.</p>\n\n<p>One thing that has changed in the last several months is the <strong>Ukrainians\u2019 willingness to share intelligence with the US</strong>, allowing American officials to better help the Ukrainians shape their battlefield operations.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot more trust now than there was at the beginning of the war,\u201d said one Ukrainian source close to President Volodymyr Zelensky. \u201cAnd the Ukrainians recognize that the more they share, the more they are likely to get in return.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>A US military source added that there has been \u201cdecent communication at varying levels about what\u2019s being planned on the political side and the military side. <strong>There\u2019s pretty good military transparency.</strong>\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In Kherson, where Ukraine telegraphed its intentions for months before the counteroffensive began, Russia had time to prepare, digging in to protect the territory around one of the first cities they occupied early in the war. <strong>Ukraine\u2019s advances there have been incremental and deliberate, one official said, and there is no rapid advance through collapsing Russian lines.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Some analysts have described the Kherson offensive as a \u201cfixing\u201d operation designed to keep Russian troops engaged away from the fight in Kharkiv.</p>\n\n<p>In Kharkiv, however, the attack caught the Russians by surprise and without any well-prepared defenses, allowing the Ukrainian military to rapidly reclaim thousands of square miles of territory.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Russia has so far failed to meaningfully stop the counteroffensive in Ukraine\u2019s south or east</strong> as the problems they had early in the war \u2013 supply line issues, logistical problems, and a lack of effective command and control \u2013 still plague the Russian military, officials said. Russia proved unable to hold the territory it had seized, partially because of the high cost imposed on them by Ukrainian defenders.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The US is less concerned about Ukraine\u2019s ability to hold reclaimed territory</strong>, officials said, even in the east, where Ukrainian forces have moved more than 60 kilometers within days in some cases. Ukraine\u2019s supply lines are internal, whereas Russia\u2019s were outside its own borders.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, Ukraine\u2019s forces will get a significant boost to morale and will from the recent victories, one official said, while Russia\u2019s depleted forces will feel the opposite.</p>\n\n<p><strong>It\u2019s \u201cnot a real concern of [Ukraine] overstretching supply lines,\u201d an official said</strong>. Despite Russian claims of destroying the US-provided HIMARS, <strong>all of the 16 systems remain accounted for and the \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of M777 howitzers also remain in operation, officials said</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Both of them are also well known, close advisors of Putin, and even though in their case it's not as immediately obvious as with a lot of other oligarchs, they also hold significant sway over Russia as a whole due to their own positions, their families' positions and their wealth, with their sons either holding or having held top positions at Gazprom, major Russian banks and also in the Russian agricultural sector, with [Bortnikov and his son in particular even being direct targets of American sanctions](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0602).\n\nBortnikov is rather withdrawn and uncharismatic, there isn't much we know about him for sure, the rumour-to-fact ratio is heavily in favour of rumours so I can't comment much on him without heavily relying on unconfirmed theories, what we do know is that he certainly shares the baggages that come with being close to Putin for a long time and being the Director of the FSB and a KGB/FSB officer for even longer, he also had a few corruption scandals but that's not particularly noteworthy. Bortnikov seems to be rather dutiful and honest in a sense, it is said that while he enjoys the lifestyle provided by his position he sees the terrible situation all around him for what it is but remains compliant to the utmost, being more of a worker who simply does his job instead of a talker who asks questions, or at least that's general perception of him and some of the more prominent rumours, he's 70 but in many ways he resembles young Putin before he became President.\n\nPatrushev on the other hand, he's the Russian equivalent of an old neocon and [unlike Medvedev](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/06/10/medvedev-russias-reforming-president-turned-arch-hawk-a77966), he's not just pretending, he has been known to be incredibly hawkish and somewhat [delusional](https://theconversation.com/as-one-of-vladimir-putins-closest-advisers-on-ukraine-nicolai-patrushev-spreads-disinformation-and-outlandish-conspiracy-theories-183699) for a long time, but he's clearly doing something right as he has never really lost favour as far as we know and continues to be very influential to this day, likely having a significant part in starting the current war as well. One could say that Putin has started to resemble Patrushev more than anyone else during the past year. \n\nSo these two seem like the most likely choices to me, but keep in mind that we know very little of the Kremlin's inner politics so even though there might be a couple of choices that might seem obvious, the succession, while most likely less chaotic than the collapse of the USSR, it wouldn't be very smooth and there are certainly more unknown factors at play than known ones. Putin hasn't designated a successor, if anything he's been getting rid of people who could succeed him to the same extent he's been getting rid of opposition in general for ages now. \n\nWhile I think a revolution or a military takeover are unlikely, they also cannot be ruled out entirely and the chances for them may improve in the long term, these events would of course turn existing power structures on their head, making things even harder to predict.

The Gripen might be able to beat out the F16 in some specific cases, but it definitely doesn't offer nearly as much capability in breadth of weapons. And that seems to be the advantage of using aircraft in warfare, they offer a HUGE amount of flexibility depending on the mission. In the morning, they can be running CAS missions near the front, in the afternoon shooting harpoons at enemy ships, and at night providing aerial protection over cities protecting against cruise missile attack. You just can't get that flexibility from any other weapon.",

If it's a 5 week course of higher quality and more specialised training to add onto existing experience or training received in Ukraine, then it could be very useful. In both cases it may be most useful in allowing regular UAF army units to be rotated away from less active fronts - e.g. the border with Belarus or Transnistria - by replacing them with these hastily-trained troops.

If it&#39;s a 5 week course of higher quality and more specialised training to add onto existing experience or training received in Ukraine, then it could be very useful. In both cases it may be most useful in allowing regular UAF army units to be rotated away from less active fronts - e.g. the border with Belarus or Transnistria - by replacing them with these hastily-trained troops.

Unlike in Russia, where people genuinely felt like NATO would come to burn there houses down and enslave their children, AFAIK, there&#39;s no similar sentiment in mainland China. </p>\n\n<p>To sum it up, my impression is that many Chinese have felt victims to nationalistic rethoric, but it&#39;s more of a &quot;let&#39;s topple American hegemony&quot; than a &quot;we got to kill them all before they come for us&quot; kind of feeling.</p>\n</div>",

Because Chinese society does have its own nationalist wing, which views Taiwan as a core issue for them, and in which the West is presented as the hostile foreign power which seeks to keep China down.</p>\n\n<p>Bottom line is, we don&#39;t fully understand the incentive structure and political dynamic in non Western societies like Russia or China, and it is arrogant to think that we do, or that people and elites in those societies have the exact same incentive structure and political dynamics like those in the West.</p>\n</div>",

I don't think they hold the same affinity for a country they don't even recognize on the other side of the world.\n\nI think this is completely wrong. First, Europe didn't care in 2014. Second, Europe didn't care in February 2022. The official NATO plan was to let Russia conquer Ukraine, sanction them a bit, and worry about domestic problems.\n\nThe reason Europe cares is because Ukraine showed them it was willing to fight and able to win, and a plucky democratic underdog with a good media team fighting the big evil authoritarian is the west's favorite thing in the world.

In contrast, it was their ability to stand up for themselves and win that made the difference.

Plus, their navy may be becoming less effective if the Russians are running short of precision missiles.\n5. Long-range strike capability: Clearly the Russians are well ahead in this respect.

It also means that the global fleet of LNG tankers will now have to massively increase the volumes sold to Europe (Asia is traditionally where a lot of the LNG market is located), and that of course, the gas producers will need to ramp up production and put more natural gas on the market. Many of these changes will have happened by next summer (new LNG terminals in Germany, more efficient routing of LNG tankers, natural gas production increase, reduction of European gas demand,...), so the crazy volatility on the energy markets and all this talk of energy rationing in Europe will be over by the end of this winter.\n\nThe more long-term problem for Europe is that LNG, while being a geopolitically diversified and therefore inherently less volatile market, is on average more expensive than pipeline gas. Meaning that gas prices in Europe will trend higher than they were before the war once everything stabilises. That's a strategic problem for European industry, because that directly affects their revenue. So there's going to have to be some long-term plan to reduce energy prices in Europe.\n\nOn the demand side, gas is used for 3 broad applications: industry, residential heating and electricity generation. Switching industry off of gas either requires expensive investments, or is not realistically possible. Insulating homes and moving them to heat pumps cannot happen faster than the construction industry can do it, and there are already talks of full order books and multi-year waiting lists for companies in the field.

Realistically, only a few percent of homes can be transitioned in a single year.\n\nThe only area where gas consumption in Europe can be seriously reduced is in electricity generation. And here it's important to note that electricity prices were up not only because of over half pf the French nuclear fleet being offline, but also because the drought severely depressed hydropower generation. Which meant that slightly *more* gas than usual had to be burned, which obviously lead to catastrophic price increases. The majority of French powerplants coming back online over the winter is reassuring, but a lot will also depend on the weather next year. If we have a rainy winter and spring, the dams will be full. But if we don't and next summer is another drought like this year, things are going to be grim. The only other solution is more renewables, which is indeed growing rapidly, but they need to grow even faster if they have to compensate a shortfall of both gas and hydro.

In addition, as multiple people have pointed out, it isn't even a Russian tank that they would have stored for their own uses, it is an export model. Of course it would not be counted as a Russian tank storage site if it is part of the supply chain for exports. But how do you even know no one within the OSINT community hasn't picked this base up? Obviously Benjamin Pittet, whoever that is, and Rob Lee knows about it.\n\nYou have no idea how many tanks are stored indoors there based on this clip. Where on earth are you getting \"hundreds of tanks\"? And how do you know based on that short clip there aren't any tanks stored outdoors there? There is no background shown here. And how on earth do you know there might be \"dozens\" more of such sights around Russia? Please source your claims.\n\nAll you're doing here is pulling s\\*\\*t out of your ass to sound smart. You are completely making all of this up based on an 11 second clip showing 3 tanks. This is absurd and pathetic.\n\nIf you have even a single reason to believe a single thing you've claimed, please provide sources.\n\n  \nEdit: funny enough, I took a look at the historic imagery. The storage on that base was built in 2015. Before that it was mostly outdoor storage. Whatever is there now was either already there and moved indoors or was moved from other bases.  \n\n\nI think the biggest problem with your reasoning is that it ignores what we already know. We know roughly how many tanks the USSR and Russia have built over the decades. How many have been sold overseas. How many were lost in Afghanistan, Chechnya, etc. Whatever tanks were shipped to this indoor facility in 2016 when construction was finished came from some other stockpile. Its not like they just appeared magically out of nowhere and Russia secretly has 10-20% more tanks in mint conditions just hiding around Russia that nobody can track via satellite. Anyone can look these satellite images up for free, or pay for even higher resolution (temporally and spatially).",
