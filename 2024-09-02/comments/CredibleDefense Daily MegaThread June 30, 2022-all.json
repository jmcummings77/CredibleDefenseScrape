They tend to be new immigrants, tend to be in low paid roles and tend to be &#39;working class&#39;. For some reason people only think of white british people as working class though. Lots of cultural nonsense to unpack tbh. The dynamics in Russia are clearly different (they&#39;re not immigrants) and are more about regional inequalities instead. </p>\n\n<p>Aren&#39;t almost all US recruits from poor areas?

Mobile defenses orient on the destruction of the attacking force by permitting the enemy to advance into a position that exposes the enemy to counterattack by the striking force.*\" ^[1](https://www.benning.army.mil/mssp/PDF/adp3_90.pdf)\n\nSo not only would you propose they vacate the defense in depth strategy that has worked for them so far, you'd have them launch offensive operations they're not equipped to initiate, nevermind sustain? \n\n>When did UAF forces retreat when they weren't absolutely forced to with no other options?\n\nThey've withdrawn numerous times ahead of attacks in certain areas ever since Russia dramatically downsized it's war goals. \n\nAlso, why would they just withdraw for the sake of withdrawing?\n\nI'm so confused as to your messaging here. You're literally faulting defenders for defending and not yielding more ground to the Russians.

Ukraine would gather its mechanized forces into several multi-divisional operational groupings (corps or armies), and attempt through a combination of better intelligence, superior tactical and operational proficiency, brilliant leadership, and high mobility to \"box\" with roughly twice as many similar Russian groupings. The purpose would be to maneuver for advantage, and to fight only under conditions that would produce greatly favorable exchange rates. This would involve large scale \"ambushes\" of unsuspecting Russian formations on the move, slashing surprise flank attacks, and speedily executed and completed encirclement operations. Space would often be traded for time. These are very demanding operations.\n\n>Unlike the previous strategy, this one would concede, when necessary, bloodless Russian occupation of Russian populated areas of Ukraine. It does, however, hope to recover those areas once Russian forces are smashed in maneuver battles. **If the Russians adopt a limited aims strategy, and do not go much beyond these zones, the mobile defense strategy is presented with a problem. Ukrainian forces would have to try to retake them. Given Russian quantitative superiority, technological parity or superiority, probable air superiority, and the advantages that normally accrue to a tactical defender, Ukrainian forces are unlikely to be successful. Ukrainian generals would probably try to devise counter-attacks elsewhere that would jeopardize the Russian hold on these zones. Such counter-attacks might even take Ukrainian forces into Russia. But it will be very difficult to contest a Russian \"limited-aims\" offensive with a mobile defense.**\n\n>**Aside from losing the border areas without a fight, the strategy is quite vulnerable to catastrophic failure. There are no obvious reasons why Ukrainians should be able to outfight Russians in mobile warfare. The two cultures are similar. The weapons are nearly identical. The generals were trained in the same schools. In eastern Ukraine, the population--both Russian and Russo-phone Ukrainian, could in many areas prove more hostile to Ukrainian soldiers than to Russians. The Ukrainians would likely be outnumbered by two to one or worse. Russian technical intelligence assets are likely to be somewhat better than Ukrainian, but certainly not worse. Russian command, control, and communications capabilities also seem likely to be superior to those of the Ukrainian armed forces.**\n\n>**Though we have said little about the role of tactical aviation in a Ukrainian-Russian war, there is no reason to believe that Ukraine would enjoy air superiority over eastern Ukraine.**\n\n>Maximally, the Russians could themselves achieve air superiority, and harvest some of the advantages in these open spaces that coalition air forces enjoyed in Operation Desert Storm. **In the event they should attempt a true mobile defense against any plausible Russian military strategy, limited aims or otherwise, all of the foregoing adds up to a great probability that Ukrainian operational groupings will be surrounded, cut off from outside sources of supply, and annihilated. Alternatively, as they maneuver for advantage, but fail to achieve it, they would simply be run into the ground, exhausted without a safe place to rest soldiers, repair equipment, and replenish fuel and ammunition.**\n\n>Finally, it is worth noting a strategic vulnerability that both of these strategies share.** Even if the Russians start out with a limited aims strategy--with the intent of conquering Crimea, and the three or four easternmost oblasts of dense Russian settlement, the likely catastrophic failure of these forward defense or mobile defense strategies would incur the destruction of most if not all of the Ukrainian army.** Thus it runs a very high risk of giving the Russians the \"victory disease.\" The gate will be open to the Polish border, why not take everything?\n\nOn Defense in depth from the same paper. It's excessive so I'm going to grab the important stuff:\n\n>Ukraine would need two types of military force to execute this [defense in depth] strategy. Mechanized mobile forces would be necessary to mount a very large scale \"covering force\" operation in eastern and northeastern Ukraine. They would buy time for reserve, mainly infantry, forces in western Ukraine to mobilize and prepare defenses in depth. **They would also attempt to erode the combat power of advancing Russian formations.**\n\n>The bulk of Ukrainian mechanized forces (perhaps a dozen reorganized divisions, see below) would be committed to a large-scale \"covering force operation\" in north central and eastern Ukraine. **Again, however, there would be no pretense at a successful defense against a determined Russian challenge. Their main purpose would be slowing the Russian advance towards the Dnipro and western Ukraine to buy time for large scale mobilization and defensive preparations. Additionally, this phase of the campaign would endeavor to exploit every advantage and tactic typically employed by outnumbered defenders to inflict disproportionate attrition on the attacking Russians.**\n\n>**Extensive demolitions would supplement more conventional military operations to slow the attackers' progress, and complicate their subsequent logistics.**... As the Ukrainians retreat into geographical areas where Ukrainians constitute a greater ethnic majority, it may prove possible to organize \"stay-behind\" forces to collect intelligence on the Russians and engage in partisan warfare. This too should be planned in advance.\n\n>Unlike the pure mobile defense, however, Ukrainian generals would be instructed to err on the side of caution in this covering force operation. **It would be understood that the Russians have a powerful advantage and cannot be decisively defeated. Ultimately, a substantial percentage of these mobile forces would be needed to assist in a defense of the Dnipro line, so their complete destruction cannot be risked in a quixotic pursuit of decisive victory over quantitatively superior Russian forces.** My own crude estimate is that the Ukrainians could not afford to lose more than about one-half the combat power associated with these units. These operations will thus require considerable military skill, and a great deal of self-discipline at the command level. They will not be easy.\n\n>Some key urban objectives, such as Kiev, span the river line.**Here, the ruthless expedient of urban warfare must be adopted. The city itself becomes a key part of the fortification system.** Finally, depending on the availability of resources in peacetime, it would be reasonable to organize additional zones of resistance even further to the West. **At some point in the course of a Dnipro River defensive operation, a Ukrainian commander might determine that organized withdrawal offered a better chance to salvage the force for continued warfare than would continued stubborn resistance at the river line.**\n\n>**Without reinforcement by mobile, mechanized reserves, these frontline infantry divisions can be ground away in critical sectors; the extended defensive system will then collapse, and large numbers of infantry units will simply be surrounded**. **Fortunately, even a 50 division Russian force would not be able to muster highly favorable force ratios everywhere, the Russian army would be able to mount a finite number of main attacks. As these materialize the front-line Ukrainian infantry divisions would be supplemented in the defense by the armored divisions and rocket-launcher brigades held in reserve.** The historical record of armored breakthrough operations suggests the critical importance of these mobile reserves. Additionally, Ukraine is entitled to 330 attack helicopters under CFE, which would form additional, powerful mobile anti-armor tactical reserves. **A sequence of breakthrough battles by a quantitatively superior enemy will ultimately exhaust even these reserves, or at least their fuel. When they are gone, the frontline infantry defenses will crack. For this reason, even the defense suggested here would probably ultimately require fuel and weaponry from outside the country to survive beyond a few months of intense combat.**\n\nI hope all of that sounds familiar, because it's what they're doing. \n\nI *implore* you to read up on this stuff and stop trying to engage in armchair interpretation.",

They would buy time for reserve, mainly infantry, forces in western Ukraine to mobilize and prepare defenses in depth. <strong>They would also attempt to erode the combat power of advancing Russian formations.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The bulk of Ukrainian mechanized forces (perhaps a dozen reorganized divisions, see below) would be committed to a large-scale &quot;covering force operation&quot; in north central and eastern Ukraine. <strong>Again, however, there would be no pretense at a successful defense against a determined Russian challenge. Their main purpose would be slowing the Russian advance towards the Dnipro and western Ukraine to buy time for large scale mobilization and defensive preparations. Additionally, this phase of the campaign would endeavor to exploit every advantage and tactic typically employed by outnumbered defenders to inflict disproportionate attrition on the attacking Russians.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Extensive demolitions would supplement more conventional military operations to slow the attackers&#39; progress, and complicate their subsequent logistics.</strong>... As the Ukrainians retreat into geographical areas where Ukrainians constitute a greater ethnic majority, it may prove possible to organize &quot;stay-behind&quot; forces to collect intelligence on the Russians and engage in partisan warfare. This too should be planned in advance.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike the pure mobile defense, however, Ukrainian generals would be instructed to err on the side of caution in this covering force operation. <strong>It would be understood that the Russians have a powerful advantage and cannot be decisively defeated. Ultimately, a substantial percentage of these mobile forces would be needed to assist in a defense of the Dnipro line, so their complete destruction cannot be risked in a quixotic pursuit of decisive victory over quantitatively superior Russian forces.</strong> My own crude estimate is that the Ukrainians could not afford to lose more than about one-half the combat power associated with these units. These operations will thus require considerable military skill, and a great deal of self-discipline at the command level. They will not be easy.</p>\n\n<p>Some key urban objectives, such as Kiev, span the river line.<strong>Here, the ruthless expedient of urban warfare must be adopted. The city itself becomes a key part of the fortification system.</strong> Finally, depending on the availability of resources in peacetime, it would be reasonable to organize additional zones of resistance even further to the West. <strong>At some point in the course of a Dnipro River defensive operation, a Ukrainian commander might determine that organized withdrawal offered a better chance to salvage the force for continued warfare than would continued stubborn resistance at the river line.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Without reinforcement by mobile, mechanized reserves, these frontline infantry divisions can be ground away in critical sectors; the extended defensive system will then collapse, and large numbers of infantry units will simply be surrounded</strong>. <strong>Fortunately, even a 50 division Russian force would not be able to muster highly favorable force ratios everywhere, the Russian army would be able to mount a finite number of main attacks. As these materialize the front-line Ukrainian infantry divisions would be supplemented in the defense by the armored divisions and rocket-launcher brigades held in reserve.</strong> The historical record of armored breakthrough operations suggests the critical importance of these mobile reserves. Additionally, Ukraine is entitled to 330 attack helicopters under CFE, which would form additional, powerful mobile anti-armor tactical reserves. <strong>A sequence of breakthrough battles by a quantitatively superior enemy will ultimately exhaust even these reserves, or at least their fuel. When they are gone, the frontline infantry defenses will crack. For this reason, even the defense suggested here would probably ultimately require fuel and weaponry from outside the country to survive beyond a few months of intense combat.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I hope all of that sounds familiar, because it&#39;s what they&#39;re doing. </p>\n\n<p>I <em>implore</em> you to read up on this stuff and stop trying to engage in armchair interpretation.</p>\n</div>",

After a series of damaging failures, a senior Iranian intelligence official lost his job and a Revolutionary Guards general was said to have been arrested.*\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/29/world/middleeast/israel-iran-spy-chief.html\n\nBy Farnaz Fassihi and Ronen Bergman June 29, 2022\n\nFor more than a decade, he was a feared presence in Iran, presiding over a vast intelligence apparatus. He crushed domestic dissent and political rivals, and expanded covert operations beyond Iran\u2019s borders to target dissidents and enemies abroad.\n\nHossein Taeb, a 59-year-old cleric and chief of intelligence for the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, seemed untouchable.\n\nThat was until he was abruptly removed from his position last week, a casualty of a relentless campaign by Israel to undermine Iran\u2019s security by targeting its officials and military sites, according to officials and analysts in both countries.\n\nA botched Iranian effort to target Israeli citizens in Turkey, which caused an embarrassing diplomatic crisis with Ankara, a regional ally of Tehran, eventually tipped the balance, according to Israeli intelligence officials briefed on the Iranian plot who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive operations and intelligence topics.\n\nThe removal of Mr. Taeb was an acknowledgment by Tehran that confronting the threat from Israel required new leadership and a reset of strategies and protocols, according to Mohammad Ali Abtahi, a reformist former vice president of Iran and cleric who was ousted by conservatives in 2009 but has maintained close ties to top officials.\n\n\u201cThe security breaches inside Iran and the vast scope of operations by Israel have really undermined our most powerful intelligence organization,\u201d Mr. Abtahi said by telephone from Tehran. \u201cThe strength of our security has always been the bedrock of the Islamic Republic and it has been damaged in the past year.\u201d\n\nCalls to purge Mr. Taeb appeared amid a growing climate of mistrust within the Iranian leadership after a senior commander in the Revolutionary Guards, Brig. Gen. Ali Nasiri, was secretly arrested on allegations of spying for Israel, according to a person with close ties to top officials in the Revolutionary Guards and another with knowledge of the arrest. They and other Iranian officials quoted in this article requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record about internal discussions.\n\nOfficials with Iran\u2019s mission to the United Nations said they had no immediate comment about the claims.\n\nGeneral Nasiri\u2019s detention came two months after several dozen employees of the Ministry of Defense\u2019s missile development program were arrested on suspicion of leaking classified military information, including design blueprints of missiles, to Israel, according to an Iranian official familiar with the raid.\n\nDuring the past year, Israel has intensified the scope and frequency of its attacks inside Iran, including on the nuclear and military sites that Mr. Taeb\u2019s organization was responsible for protecting.\n\nOne of the Israeli officials said that part of the strategy entailed exposing failures by the Revolutionary Guards in their covert war with Israel in the hope that it would create conflict between political leaders and the defense and intelligence establishment.\n\nOn Monday, three Iranian steel factories, one of them the state-owned Khuzestan Steel, was hit in a cyber attack forcing one to halt its production line. The three factories hit Monday are major suppliers of steel to the Revolutionary Guards, according to a Western intelligence official.\n\nA group of hackers known as Gonjeshke Darande claimed responsibility. The same group claimed responsibility for another cyber attack in November that disabled gas stations across Iran and that U.S. officials said was connected to Israel. Officials in Israel declined to confirm the source of the attacks.\n\nIsrael\u2019s spy network has infiltrated deep into the rank and file of Iran\u2019s security circles, Iranian officials have acknowledged, with Iran\u2019s former minister of intelligence warning last year that officials should fear for their lives, according to Iranian media reports.\n\nKeren Hajioff, a senior adviser to Prime Minister Naftali Bennett of Israel, said in an interview that the strategy targeting Iran was part of Mr. Bennett\u2019s \u201coctopus\u201d doctrine.\n\n\u201cThis doctrine is a strategic shift from the past, when Israel focused on Iran\u2019s proxy \u2018tentacles\u2019 across the region, in Lebanon, Syria and Gaza,\u201d she said. The new tactic, she added, was \u201ca paradigm shift: Now we go straight for the head.\u201d\n\nIsraeli agents have carried out assassinations with remote-controlled robots and in drive-by shootings, flown drones into sensitive missile and nuclear facilities, and kidnapped and interrogated an agent of the Revolutionary Guards inside Iran. Tehran also suspects that Israel killed two of its scientists in May.\n\nMr. Taeb was appointed the head of the Revolutionary Guards\u2019 intelligence organization in 2009 after nationwide unrest over disputed presidential elections. He had previously served as the chief of the Basij, a plainclothes militia notorious for attacking and sometimes killing protesters.\n\nMr. Taeb enforced systematic crackdowns with a brutality that elevated the intelligence organization from an obscure security unit to the most feared spying operation in the country.",

They really are trying their best not to participate in this (even Lukashenko). They can't exactly stand up to Russia (unless they want to end up like Ukraine, just unlike Ukraine unable to defend themselves), but they're not participating in the invasion. Some sanctions against them are a good idea (for letting Russians invade from their soil etc), but while I for instance 100% support Russian players being banned from Wimbledon, I'm not sure I agree with Belarus also banned. Kinda like the difference between USSR and countries like Poland/Czechoslovakia/Romania/Hungary that just had to listen to USSR during the Cold war.",

Having a lot in reserve doesn&#39;t help when it&#39;s a lot of it is needing serious repairs or simply too far gone to be used </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>natural resources to keep their economy on life support</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While a steady revenue of money helps, there isn&#39;t much money made from resource extraction can do when your manufacturing base collapses, you are sanctioned to shit, dealing with very high inflation, and already have large swaths of the country in heavy poverty. More over they&#39;re likely set to lose money as OPEC or at least the Saudi&#39;s are supposedly set to produce more, EU countries are either by choice or by Russia&#39;s own hand attempting to let go of Russian resources for other alternatives or for environmental reasons</p>\n\n<p>While a lot of the talk of Russia being on death&#39;s door is obviously proven wrong at this point, I don&#39;t think making Russia stronger than it likely is, is going to help either. A more realistic approach doesn&#39;t swing wildly between optimistic for Ukraine to fatalistic for Ukraine</p>\n</div>",
