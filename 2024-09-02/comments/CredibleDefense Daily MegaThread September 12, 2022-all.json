Then on top of that, after the fact, a competent military looks at the events leading up to those catastrophic events and they work to mitigate it from happening in the future. A competent leadership makes those kind of decisions that may not immediately seem important, but will prevent unnecessary loss of even just 1 or 2 lives and equipment. When the leadership can&#39;t make such simple decisions based on an abundance of information, you can surmise that some of their other doctrine and training is also probably full of small seemingly insignificant oversights, but can lead to major issues when shit hits the fan in an actual war and your operational tempo is 1000% higher than it usually is.</p>\n</div>",

They can use the highway to access the whole defensive line and its that bit closer to that rail line. So anchoring a line that much further east is probably more sustainable. \n\nPotato quality map.

Hard to tell from the outside what happens when push comes to shove, ie whether the regime collapses or the security forces are willing to use violence to suppress any revolt. My bet would lean towards the latter. </li>\n<li>To some extent he can spin things the way he wants to, given the propaganda apparatus. Call it a victory and retreat. The people who have died so far are from the provinces or LDPR, so who cares in Moscow or St. Petersburg.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",

Probably one of the most irresponsible invasions since Iraq attacked Kuwait.\n\nHowever I think the invasion laid bare an intrinsic lack of capabilities. How could the vaunted VVS, with hundreds of modernized planes, years of real operational experience in Syria, 2000+km long range strike capabilities, operating in their home turf, against a tiny air force with less than 100 old hand-me-down planes and 1970s air defense systems, not even come to achieve air supremacy? Especially after 6 months, where you would think they would have the time to change the plan, or allow a long term strategy to unfurl. I suspect it is not because of bad planning, it is because they simply lack the capabilities. That comes down to procurement and training. USAF spends a ton of money on training for specific missions like SEAD, VVS clearly did not. They knew Ukraine had S-300s, Buks and OSAs, why did they not prepare to take those out? Even in Syria VVS really only musters one and two ship formations, they have enough planes to act in bigger formations, why can't they? The US figured out how to use air power alone to degrade and destroy an enemy air force in just a few months of fighting Japan in 1942, how could the Russians not do the same?\n\nSome thing with ground forces, the Western mil district, which was suppose to be the most ready and capable force lost most of its mobile forces due to mechanical failures in the first month. Now probably a lot of that is due to the terrible OPLAN but when half your tanks are breaking down 10 days into an invasion that was being prepared for in earnest for over a year I suspect they lacked funding to do even the most basic maintenance or to have sufficient logistics to support operations. And force structure is determined by funding. They did not have money of resources to give BTGs even close to the logistics support of a Western unit and the result is Ukrainian tractors hauling off hundreds of tanks to sell on ebay tax free. \n\nAlso the overall force structure they went to war with was lacking infantry, probably their biggest weakness. How come they had a dearth of it? In manpower rich Russia? One reason was the bad planning by not mobilizing and calling it a war so they went with 70% strength units without their conscripts, but if they had more money and resources dedicated to this just 2 years ago, they would have probably been able to get more contractors on hand to send in, at least to have more than a few hundred guys in each BTG. \n\nI could go on, they went to war with the army they had and it was clearly not good enough, my thesis is it is because they had frittered away too much resources on a variety of capabilities like navy, nuclear and long range strike systems that were not useful for a large scale conventional war.",

Something, of course does not mean forming an army up and marching on Baku here, it can be provision of C4I and weapons, or advisors, etc.\n* If some CSTO states decline to participate, there are fissures that need to be repaired.\n\nLooking at a Military Intervention for a moment:\n\nSo, a quick wikipedia run shows that the CSTO (Not including Russia) could probably deploy a full Corps of 2-3 divisions at most including corps troops. Roughly, ish. Again, that's a two minute analysis there. Which is a sufficient amount of troops to tip the scales.\n\nPolitics aside, if the CSTO does decide to deploy forces in defense of Armenia, they will need to be moved, equipped and supplied. The problems I see are as follows:\n\n1. Does this become a \"*Everyone but Russia 'theatre*'\" - Moscow will have to draw forces, equipment and ammunition to make a token force. Those forces can and will include logistics units and most likely an air component.\n2. What impact will this have on Logistics in Ukraine? Rolling stock, airlift, trucks, and war-stock will need to be used in any such operation. This of course hampers operations in Ukraine.\n3. How effective will CSTO forces be operating in a joint environment? How will they coordinate command and control? I think the default would be that Russia would have to take the lead, causing further issues with providing headquarters and staff for another theatre. I think the cupboard right now is a bit bare.\n4. How quickly can the first bit of military aid arrive in theatre? Could the threat alone cause a ceasefire? Rapid deployment may be a problem, which makes the situation that much more complex. Could Russia airlift arms, materiel and advisors in quickly?\n5. What of Russia's.......lackluster performance over the past few months. Obviously, the giant is not 12 feet tall anymore.

Such measures shall be terminated when the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security .\n\nArticle 4 of the [TREATY on Collective Security (PDF)](https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%201894/volume-1894-I-32307-English.pdf) of the CSTO:\n\n> If an aggression is committed against one of the States Parties by any state or a group of states, it will be considered as an aggression against all the States Parties to this Treaty.\n\n> In case an act of aggression is committed against any of the States Parties, all the other States Parties will render it necessary assistance, including military one, as well as provide support with the means at their disposal through an exercise of the right to collective defense in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter.\n\n> The States Parties will immediately inform the United Nations Security Council of the measures taken in accordance with this Article. While taking these measures, the States Parties will abide by the relevant provisions of the UN Charter.\n\nSo they're similar.

Apparently the `SM` modification is since Syria. See the post dated `30 Mar 2019, 17:58`. Here's the translated blurb from the 3rd link:\n\n> The SAP-518 jamming station is located in containers mounted on the wingtips of the aircraft. This station is designed for individual protection of aircraft and carries out the production of simulating and diverting jamming of air defense radars, airborne radars of enemy fighters and active homing heads of air-to-air missiles. The principle of operation of such interference is quite simple. The jamming station receives the radar signal and simply \"copies\" it, redirecting it back to the source. Because the signal emitted by the jamming station is usually more powerful than the radar signal reflected from the aircraft, then the enemy radar receiver \"tunes\" to it. After that, the jamming station starts setting up the distracting interference on all channels for determining the parameters of the target - range, speed and angular coordinates, which are slightly modified enemy radar signals, as a result of which the enemy missile is aimed at a \"phantom\" target with a high probability. With the successful setting of diverting jamming, a short-term shutdown of the jamming station leads to a disruption in tracking the target by the guidance radar or the active homing head of the enemy missile. It is also possible to hide the position of the aircraft by \"bombing\" the enemy's radar with imitation interference, which leads to the illumination of a narrow sector of the radar indicator and makes it impossible or extremely difficult to obtain information about the real position of the target. The facilities of the Khibiny complex have electronic signal processing modules made using DRFM (Digital Radio Frequency Memory) technology - the so-called. \"radio frequency memory\" which allows real-time signal analysis and interference of any form.

        "body": "Edit, original post kept below: Armenia has just requested CTSO engagement and for an emergency UNSC session. Doesn't mean war will happen--things can deescalate. But very clear that Russia is perceived as weak and Azerbaijan thinks it can win any conflict with Russia. We will see soon enough.\n\nAn update on the Armenian front: https://twitter.com/armgov/status/1569458016780701696?t=tkqYHa8pOzfNXv6n3-gmTw&s=19. Basically--Putin and the PM of Armenia have had urgent talks. According to Armenia, they are being shelled across their entire border, and into Armenia proper. Obviously, Azerbaijan saw what happened in Kharkiv and is now staking out a far more aggressive push given perceived Russian weakness.\n\nThis sort of assault would trigger the CSTO... under normal circumstances.

We will see soon enough.</p>\n\n<p>An update on the Armenian front: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/armgov/status/1569458016780701696?t=tkqYHa8pOzfNXv6n3-gmTw&amp;s=19\">https://twitter.com/armgov/status/1569458016780701696?t=tkqYHa8pOzfNXv6n3-gmTw&amp;s=19</a>. Basically--Putin and the PM of Armenia have had urgent talks. According to Armenia, they are being shelled across their entire border, and into Armenia proper. Obviously, Azerbaijan saw what happened in Kharkiv and is now staking out a far more aggressive push given perceived Russian weakness.</p>\n\n<p>This sort of assault would trigger the CSTO... under normal circumstances.

This is Ukraines version of Germany's Ardennes Offensive (Battle of the Bulge) in 1944. Scraping together forces from all over the front and equipment. They lost over 4,000 people in that Offensive while Russians lost below 500. They lost over 200,000 people this war. 180,000 dead, 200,000 wounded and 1,000s of deserters while Russia has only lost 13,000-15,000 killed. They are running so slow on meat that the Ukrainians are recruiting old men and 14 year old boys to join the army (as shown by people in Odessa) I only feel bad for the civilians who decided to stay because the Ukrainian filth are going to murder a lot of them.\u201d\n\nThe reason why I post this is to show how far gone a lot of these supporters are. The people who would demand nuclear strikes most if russia lost are seemingly the same people who would accept any outcome if Putin told them that it's okay. Of course, not everyone falls into this bucket, but I really think this anecdote really shows that in many ways reality is irrelevant to the public opinion. Just like my friend here, I really don't think even going to pre feb 24th borders will shift opinion because somehow Ukraine will be \"crippled beyond belief and never a threat to Russia again\"",

The Biden administration, which has dispatched more than $15 billion worth of weapons and other security assistance to Ukraine, has declined to provide that system over concerns Ukraine could use it to strike Russian territory and spark a wider conflict with the West.\n\n\nUkraine\u2019s list of requirements for \u201coffensive operations\u201d includes 29 types of weapon systems and ammunition. Among them are tanks, drones, artillery systems; more Harpoon antiship missiles; and 2,000 missiles for the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or Himars, which the U.S. began providing earlier this year.\n\nIt follows the recent publication of a strategy statement by Valeriy Zaluzhny, the commander in chief of Ukraine\u2019s force, and Mykhailo Zabrodsky, a member of the Ukrainian parliament and a senior military officer who led the most significant Ukrainian counterattack in the 2014 war with Russia.\n\nThey argued that Russia has long-range cruise missiles that greatly outdistance the systems in the Ukrainian inventory. A turning point could come if the Ukrainians also had longer-range systems, they argued, specifically mentioning the ATACMS.\n\n\u201cThe only way to radically change the strategic situation is, without a doubt, for the Armed Forces of Ukraine to launch several consecutive, and ideally, simultaneous counterattacks during the 2023 campaign,\u201d they wrote.\n\nAsked Friday why the U.S. remained reluctant to give Ukraine the ATACMS missiles, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the U.S. is committed to giving the Ukrainians what they need to beat back the Russian forces, but said, \u201cIt\u2019s not just about one particular weapon or weapons system.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about how you integrate these systems and how you integrate the efforts of various elements in the inventory to create effects that provide advantage to the Ukrainians,\u201d he said in Prague alongside Czech Minister of Defense Jana Cernochova. \u201cAnd we\u2019re beginning to see that.\u201d\n\nUkrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov told the Journal in July that his country needs the ATACMS because Russia has longer-range multiple rocket launch systems. He said his country has \u201cpassed the test\u201d with its successful use of Himars, which has a range closer to 40 miles.",

A turning point could come if the Ukrainians also had longer-range systems, they argued, specifically mentioning the ATACMS.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe only way to radically change the strategic situation is, without a doubt, for the Armed Forces of Ukraine to launch several consecutive, and ideally, simultaneous counterattacks during the 2023 campaign,\u201d they wrote.</p>\n\n<p>Asked Friday why the U.S. remained reluctant to give Ukraine the ATACMS missiles, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the U.S. is committed to giving the Ukrainians what they need to beat back the Russian forces, but said, \u201cIt\u2019s not just about one particular weapon or weapons system.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s about how you integrate these systems and how you integrate the efforts of various elements in the inventory to create effects that provide advantage to the Ukrainians,\u201d he said in Prague alongside Czech Minister of Defense Jana Cernochova. \u201cAnd we\u2019re beginning to see that.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov told the Journal in July that his country needs the ATACMS because Russia has longer-range multiple rocket launch systems. He said his country has \u201cpassed the test\u201d with its successful use of Himars, which has a range closer to 40 miles.</p>\n</div>",

Hard to tell visually, but he may still be in [ground effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_effect_(aerodynamics\\)) during the initial bank, benefiting from some additional lift, and his angle of attack never gets high enough for ground effect-induced stall.\n\nThe aircraft on the right (the one that crashes) initially pulls upward as if to climb straight out before banking left, then over-corrects, perhaps after seeing his wingman fall below him. He sheds altitude (a big no-no during takeoff and departure!) and banks steeply. I suspect what happened is that he was still configured to increase his roll angle, just about to re-adjust into a stable bank, when his left wing hit the wake turbulence. At that point his left wing starts creating less lift and his left aileron loses its effectiveness, while his right wing is still configured for the roll. If you watch closely you can see that he starts with a bank that's steep but probably not outside the aircraft's normal capabilities - a little steeper than his wingman - then as he starts to cross the wake turbulence his aircraft gets \"yanked\" so that the wings are nearly vertical, and at that moment he's toast. You can see the angular momentum is uncontrollable at that point, as the plane keeps rotating and he impacts cockpit-first (hopefully meaning he died instantly on impact and didn't experience the explosion).\n\nOK, but why did that happen? Impossible to say.\n\nMaybe their pre-flight planning was inadequate, so they didn't have a shared understanding of the departure.\n\nMaybe the crashed pilot wanted to show off and deviated from the departure.\n\nMaybe the crashed pilot was departing as planned, and the other pilot wanted to show off by departing lower, and the crashed pilot tried to follow - whether to respond to the implied challenge, or because he thought his wingman was having a problem and wanted to keep him in view (the pilot sits pretty low in the Su-25 and doesn't have great visibility below him), or just instinctively.\n\nMaybe the crashed pilot had already started to lose control of the plane when he put his nose up at the beginning, before starting the roll - maybe due to lack of flight hours and/or unfamiliarity with the airframe, he overcompensated for leaving ground effect, then compounded his error by pitching his nose back down which slowed his rate of climb, then compounded that error by banking low above the ground without having a sufficient rate of climb to do so safely, and compounded *that* error by crossing his wingman's wake, making it impossible to recover from his previous errors.\n\nThere's probably deeper cultural problems at play. For example, in the latter scenario, maybe this unit doesn't emphasize safety of flight; maybe the crashed pilot felt he had to immediately adjust to match his wingman's departure, despite already losing control of his aircraft, or else he'd be mocked, reprimanded, or grounded. With a better unit culture and training that emphasizes safety of flight, maybe the pilot takes a few seconds to regain control of his aircraft, configure for a normal climb straight out, get his rate of climb back to normal, and *then* do a controlled bank to the departure direction.",

They made a lot of bad bad bets about the state of the world, and now it turns out Ukraine has the winning hand. \n\nThe first bad bet was the Zelenskyy was unpopular and that Ukraine *was* just an unruly province of Russia. That there was no Ukrainian identity worth fighting for and that if the Russians kicked the whole thing would fall over. That\u2019s not true, and it seems indeed that Ukrainian nationalism is just as strong, or stronger, than Russian. This was tested a second timing during the siege period of the war, again even under TOS bombardment Ukrainians backed Kyiv. \n\nSecond, even if Ukraine resisted it would do so poorly as it had in 2014. In 2014 the UA was in a bad state, it was corrupt at a high level, and in the initial operations was very badly handled by Russian and separatist forces. But after 2014 the UA fought nearly 8 years of low scale war, churned out thousands of skilled vets, and most importantly rooted much of the corruption out of the military. So the UA of 2022 just wasn\u2019t that of 2014.  \n\nThird, the west would be dysfunctional, distracted, and ambivalent about the war. Not a bad bet. What if Trump and La Pen had won their elections? Even still Biden and Macron, on paper, have domestic issues which probably should have militated against involvement. Especially in the wake of Afghanistan (in the short term) and the GWOT(long term). One might reasonably expect the west to be sick and tired of war. But Ukraine, the US, and the rest of NATO played the social media game really well. They kept focus on the war, and made the resupply effort into a national competition. Who will give the most, or the best, the fastest. If you can\u2019t give, you can at least sanction. There was a moment in which the peoples of every country which mattered in this crisis looked toward Kyiv, empathized with David beset by Goliath, and was horrified by the brutality of the invasion and the failure. Rather than look away, people rallied around the flag and took sides in a war. Can you imagine Germans doing that for the US in a war for Taiwan? But now in many countries it would be political suicide to say \u2018we are cutting off aid to Ukraine\u2019. Which is what Russia needs to happen. \n\nAnd fourth, no matter what Putin bet the Russian army was big enough to just smash the Ukrainians apart with or without western aid. Putin was right in concluding that his army could take 10s of thousands of casualties and keep fighting. He was wrong in assuming that the Ukrainian army would take 10s of thousands of casualties and fall apart. It didn\u2019t for the above reasons, and is really the culmination of the bad bets. \n\nIf you think like Putin, a Russian nationalist who spent the last decade turning the west against itself, I personally understood why he made the bets he did. But they just proved in hindsight to be so very badly wrong. In a way I think I\u2019m a strategic level the war was well planned. It was like a big, well built house set on a sand dune.

Massive brinksmanship?\n\nWell, he could have not invaded Ukraine at all...\n\nA serious answer is that I actually think massive brinkmanship might have had the opposite effect. Genuinely threatening NATO members, or nuclear threats beyond the usual sabre-rattling (i.e. deployment of nuclear weapons in theatre, stepped up nuclear readiness), might provoke even more drastic responses from, at the very least, the US, UK, and Eastern European states. Whilst I can see maybe the more lukewarm EU states backing down in the face of it, for the US especially, it would have to prove that such nuclear threats don't work or it risks the entire unraveling of the US-led world order. We'd have seen HIMARS with ATACMS given by the US from day one, training on Western aircraft from day one, as well as donations of Abrams. The US has clearly tried to only escalate incrementally - but if Russia is openly threatening nuclear war then that goes out of the window completely. \n\nIn terms of limiting Western assistance to Ukraine, Putin - if he was insistent on invading - only had two options: win the war before it can make any difference, or not scare the West enough that it feels compelled to make such donations of equipment and materiel.\n\nObviously Putin gambled on the first option, and had Kyiv fallen in a week then we wouldn't be having this conversation. Russia would probably have to deal with some nasty partisan or insurgent attacks with NATO provided MANPADS and ATGMs, but they wouldn't be facing HIMARS or donated armor. The risk with this plan, though, was exactly what has happened - if it doesn't work, then the West will flood Ukraine with equipment so that Russia can actually be conventionally defeated.\n\nThe alternative was to just repeat the actions from 2014 onwards - and only ratchet up the escalations slightly each time. If it had been an offensive led by D/LNR troops, much more local in scope, augmented with Russian artillery and air support, then it becomes a lot less threatening to the rest of Europe. It would feel like a continuation of what was already happening - yeah, a bit of an escalation, but ultimately not that different from what Europe was already overlooking. It's as soon as images of Russian tank columns streaming into Northern Ukraine, and missiles hit towns close to Poland, that the picture completely changes. Then even the lukewarm EU states get flashbacks to the fears of Soviets flooding the Fulda Gap that they thought had been left in the 1980s. Putin gambled on maximalist aims and their failure created Russia's current problems.",

This has helped intensify US aid as the Iraqi gov asked for formal assistance.\n\nSure, but the US occupation of Iraq predates that still. Furthermore, the decision and plan to strike ISIS was decided upon before Sinjar mountain, so its not like that was the main motivator. Its not that the US wasn't hoping to alleviate the desperate humanitarian situation on the ground, but they made that a goal once the war was already underway. I think its also worth pointing out that at this time, ISIS had American and European hostages, and the stated primary goal of the war against ISIS was to save American lives. In the end though, striking ISIS was just another leg in the in the preexisting occupation, an occupation that really wasn't about humanitarian issues in the first place.\n\n\n> That started with the invasion of Crimea and eastern Ukraine. US intervention did not start in 2022, as yourself indicate.\n\nRight, I see your point here. Mine is that we already saw a clash between Armenia and the Azeris and we didn't see the US move much to support armenia. It is still early days and that was a somewhat 'limited' war, so perhaps that will change with increased Azeri aggression, I definitely wouldn't go so far as to say that isn't a possibility.\n\n> We're talking about a scenario where Armenia is being invaded proper\n\n> If you re-read my comment above, never did I state that the US would intervene militarily in the war, just respond. US responded in Ukraine.\n\nHere is my other problem though, how does the US actually support Armenia? In the case of a full on invasion I can't imagine much support beyond sanctions against leaders of the Azerbaijan government, maybe pressure on allies like Israel to reduce arm sales to Azerbaijan. Actually supplying Armenia with weapons seems very difficult at best. Armenia is landlocked, bordering Azerbaijan, Iran, Georgia, and Turkey. Iran and Azerbaijan are obviously not going to let america roll through their country to deliver arms. Turkey is Azerbijan's ally, so I doubt they will let the US do this either. That leaves Georgia, which may work but might require cooperation with Russia which seems pretty unlikely at the moment. The other option is airdrops, but I doubt america will do that in a contested airspace unless they are willing to enforce a no fly zone first. Contrast that with ukraine, where america can easily move material across the border with poland.\n\n\nIf the Azeri's don't invade as you predict, then it leaves space for America to send weapons, but also would cause far less public pressure in America.\n\nI don't know, this all speculative, but I suspect America will try to use diplomacy and the UN, and wouldn't get involved unilaterally.",

Do you actually believe that the first time US conducts military operations in Iraq, after 3 years, it&#39;s air dropping food to the Yazids and striking ISIS that&#39;s encroaching on the mountain where they are hiding is a coincidence?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>That leaves Georgia, which may work but might require cooperation with Russia which seems pretty unlikely at the moment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>US is already selling arms to Georgia, which has ports. So supplying arms to Armenia is not a problem of logistics.</p>\n\n<p>The US wouldn&#39;t need to do much tbh. Like I said, there was never a time where Russia, USA and Europe were united on a goal and it did not come to be. Pressure and threat of intervention from Russia, US and Europe will stop Azeris in their tracks, because even if 99% chance that it&#39;s a bluff, no one&#39;s calling that bluff.</p>\n</div>",

June 15th, 2014 (4 days after ISIS captures Mosul, as ISIS is marching on Baghdad itself): [Obama is sending 275 troops to Iraq. to \"provide support and security for U.S. personnel and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad\" 'in the wake of territorial gains made by ISIS'](https://www.businessinsider.com/obama-is-sending-275-us-troops-to-iraq-2014-6)\n\n2. Approximately June 16th - June 27th, 2014; The US is openly announcing they are flying sorties over Iraq in support of the Iraqi government, furthering announcing that they are gathering intelligence required to conduct effective airstrikes in weeks time: [\"The United States has increased manned and unmanned reconnaissance flights over Iraq - to about 30 to 35 a day - in an effort to help Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki\u2019s government repel the advance of Islamist militants from the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).\" and \"[the White House] has dispatched military advisors and said it would consider air strikes against the insurgents, who have seized cities and towns across western and northern Iraq.\" and \"U.S. intelligence about the ISIL advance is improving but it could take weeks to complete a detailed picture of the threat, and any possible strikes do not appear imminent, U.S. officials said.\"](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iraq-security-usa-flights-idUSKBN0F22DR20140627)\n\n3. Approximately June 30th: [\"The United States has deployed 300 more troops to Baghdad in the last two days, with some of them assigned to secure Baghdad\u2019s international airport\", \"One senior U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject, told McClatchy that the troops were moved to Baghdad after American officials determined that Islamist fighters had consolidated their grip on the western outskirts of the capital in recent days. The movement \u201cconvinced us this would be prudent,\u201d the official said. And \"were \u201cdeploying for the purpose of protecting U.S. citizens and property, if necessary.\u201d The force \u201cis equipped for combat,\u201d the letter said, and \u201cwill remain in Iraq until the security situation becomes such that it is no longer needed.\u201d\"](https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/world/article24769897.html)\nThis brought the total number of troops deployed to Iraq in the wake of ISIS advance to [800](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-orders-200-more-u-s-personnel-to-iraq/)\n\n4. Statement from the DOD on why American military forces were returning to Iraq and outlining the goals in opposing ISIS. Published July 3rd, 2014: [\"The United States has sent troops back to Iraq because it is in America\u2019s interest for the country to remain stable and to counter Sunni militants from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said today.\" and \"Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, which has captured large sections of the country\u2019s north and west over the past few weeks, is a regional threat, Dempsey said, but could become a transnational and global threat in the future\", and \"Currently, U.S. advisors in Iraq are not involved in combat operations, Dempsey said, but he did not rule that out.\"](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/602825/chairman-describes-us-interests-in-iraq/)\n\n\nSo, what we can see from this is that US intervention began in earnest about a month and a half before ISIS captured Sinjar and threatened the massacre of the Yazidis. The US was clear about their goals to defend the embassy and airport should ISIS reach baghdad, to support the Iraqi government broadly in its war, and to weaken ISIS which they believed could become a \"global threat\". They were already openly discussing supporting future Iraqi offensive operations against ISIS and discussing the possibility of US airstrikes against ISIS in support of Iraq. They were preparing for this with armed sorties and the deployment of US special forces detachments on the ground that could call in airstrikes. Notice how nowhere in these statements did the US make mention of stopping ISIS massacres, even though ISIS had already killed thousands if not 10s of thousands of citizens as they swept through Iraq and Syria by this point.\n\n>Do you actually believe that the first time US conducts military operations in Iraq, after 3 years, it's air dropping food to the Yazids and striking ISIS that's encroaching on the mountain where they are hiding is a coincidence?\n\nAnd as you can see from all of this, its clearly not. I counter, do you think the US would have been able to suddenly strike ISIS successfully if it had not already been for the prior buildup of resources in Iraq? The US already intended to push ISIS back and prevent Iraq from undergoing a complete implosion. They were going to do that even if the Yazidis were not surrounded, they already had everything in place and were openly discussing it for a month. When the Yazidis were surrounded thats when America decided it was time to pull the trigger. It wasn't coincidence, it was just a damn good time to start the offensive operation against ISIS and to do it in a way that would gurantee public support from both sides of the political aisle in America. Frankly, its for the best it worked out this way. If America hadn't been previously preparing to strike ISIS, and only decided to do it once the Yazidis were trapped, they probably wouldn't have been in a good position to help as effectively as they did.\n\nWe have gone way off track here, but my point with all of this is that nations are primarily looking after their self interest. This isn't some anti-american statement, this is a reality of the current state of geopolitics for all nations. Nobody is being an altruist here, and that is an unfortunate reality I don't much like. Coming back to Armenia, I agree with you in the sense that I don't think America will just do nothing, but I don't know how far they would actually go and thats the key question imo. Armenia is directly supported by Russia, and America may not want to directly cooperate with Russia. Meanwhile Azerbijan is allied with Turkey, a NATO member. America and Turkey aren't in the best relations right now, and I don't know how far America is willing to go in worsening the relationship with Turkey. Another wrinkle is that Europe was looking towards Azerbijan to recoup its losses in oil and gas from Russia, so it may not fully commit as it had with Ukraine.\n\nAs you say, I agree that public support is on Armenia's side, which is good, and should Armenia see a full invasion or significant increase in hostilities I don't think America will sit around and do nothing precisely for this reason. But, I do think they would do it through the UN, and it seems like that could actually work this time because Russia wouldn't have any sensible reason to block it. I don't think America would unilaterally support Armenia with substantial arms though, and I definitely don't think they would be willing to get into a military intervention, outside of a small UN peacekeeping detachment.",

Any path north would be near constantly observed and subject to heavy pressure. Probably the logistic issue would be insurmountable. That changes as one moves south and the isthmus widens, where the situation inverts. \n\nIf the UA takes the slow and steady approach it would probably pay a heavy price and find itself at the end of a delicate logistics string. But a rapid advance in which Ukraine dramatically *bursts* into the Crimean interior would be different. So probably shaping operations, followed by a blitzing attack. \n\nBut there are other options with Crimea that would actually probably make it hard to hold long term. The American solution might be to send in the Marines, bypass the Isthmus, and strike at Sevastopol directly. This is also what the allied powers tried in 1854, tho they sailed up from the Turkish straight. Obviously Ukraine doesn\u2019t have this capacity even in its fantasy dreams. But it does have helicopters and small boats. The isthmus defense would be pretty vulnerable then to outflanking operations. Ukraine probably isn\u2019t capable of even doing company sized assaults, but SOF would have a field day inserting all across the peninsula and causing havoc. It makes the logistic strategy a lot more viable and realistic, especially during the breakout phase as the UA hit the bottom of the Isthmus. \n\nThis is all to say that, while difficult, the battle isn\u2019t impossible. Germany took Sevastopol in 41, the Soviets retook it in 44. Such a thing is doable with the proper planning and execution. That may not be worth the investment, especially if Ukraine is also fighting simultaneous dynamic battles in the Donbas. Then again, a general route from Kherson Oblast may well carry Ukraine over the isthmus without much fighting. If a Russian commander concludes he can\u2019t, for the reasons above, hold the isthmus he might retreat too far, or westward not southward. In war who knows.",

Everything off the road is sand and salt flats. Any path north would be near constantly observed and subject to heavy pressure. Probably the logistic issue would be insurmountable. That changes as one moves south and the isthmus widens, where the situation inverts. </p>\n\n<p>If the UA takes the slow and steady approach it would probably pay a heavy price and find itself at the end of a delicate logistics string. But a rapid advance in which Ukraine dramatically <em>bursts</em> into the Crimean interior would be different. So probably shaping operations, followed by a blitzing attack. </p>\n\n<p>But there are other options with Crimea that would actually probably make it hard to hold long term. The American solution might be to send in the Marines, bypass the Isthmus, and strike at Sevastopol directly. This is also what the allied powers tried in 1854, tho they sailed up from the Turkish straight. Obviously Ukraine doesn\u2019t have this capacity even in its fantasy dreams. But it does have helicopters and small boats. The isthmus defense would be pretty vulnerable then to outflanking operations. Ukraine probably isn\u2019t capable of even doing company sized assaults, but SOF would have a field day inserting all across the peninsula and causing havoc. It makes the logistic strategy a lot more viable and realistic, especially during the breakout phase as the UA hit the bottom of the Isthmus. </p>\n\n<p>This is all to say that, while difficult, the battle isn\u2019t impossible. Germany took Sevastopol in 41, the Soviets retook it in 44. Such a thing is doable with the proper planning and execution. That may not be worth the investment, especially if Ukraine is also fighting simultaneous dynamic battles in the Donbas. Then again, a general route from Kherson Oblast may well carry Ukraine over the isthmus without much fighting. If a Russian commander concludes he can\u2019t, for the reasons above, hold the isthmus he might retreat too far, or westward not southward. In war who knows.</p>\n</div>",

Now he\u2019s being mourned as a legend. Gary Schroen\u2019s death came after decades of service to the CIA, including being one of the first Americans into Afghanistan after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks*\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/09/09/gary-schroen-cia-bin-laden-9-11/\n\nInside her Northern Virginia home, Anne McFadden keeps an informal shrine to her late husband Gary Schroen, a fellow spy and one of the CIA\u2019s most revered and longest-serving officers.\n\nA staircase wall shows the cover of \u201cFirst In,\u201d Schroen\u2019s book that chronicles his mission at the age of 59 leading the agency\u2019s first officers into Afghanistan two weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks. An adjacent photo features Schroen and his colleagues on that team \u2014 its code name was \u201cJawbreaker\u201d \u2014 sporting black-and-white keffiyehs next to their helicopter, tail sign: \u201c91101.\u201d On a sideboard, 11 CIA medals, most emblazoned with the agency\u2019s seal of an eagle and a 16-point compass star, sit open in square-shaped wooden cases.\n\n\u201cYou know, he didn\u2019t talk that much about what he got the medals for,\u201d McFadden said on a recent day inside their home, where the counterintelligence specialist granted her first interview since her husband\u2019s death last month. \u201cHe had these in a drawer. I put them out.\u201d\n\nAnne McFadden shows some CIA medals of distinction earned by Schroen. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\nSchroen worked for the CIA as an operations officer and contractor for more than 50 years before dying Aug. 1 after complications from a fall outside their Alexandria home. He was 80.\n\nAt the CIA, he managed case officers and recruited foreigners as spies and collaborators, paying them with hard cash and running covert actions against enemies abroad.\n\nEven though Schroen wrote an acclaimed memoir about his most legendary operation \u2014 and even though McFadden herself has worked as a CIA employee and contractor for more than 35 years \u2014 her husband\u2019s modesty and penchant for secrecy meant she only knew so much.\n\nBut McFadden, 66, said her husband\u2019s Jawbreaker mission, which laid the groundwork for the Taliban\u2019s collapse in the fall of 2001 and the 20-year U.S. war in Afghanistan, gave Schroen the most gratification.\n\nThe operation also helped make Schroen famous at Langley, where the Russian-made (and CIA-modified) Mi-17 that choppered the Jawbreaker team over the Hindu Kush Mountains into Afghanistan was dedicated in a ceremony in 2019 as an agency museum exhibit outside on its campus.\n\nWhen Schroen died \u2014 shortly after a CIA drone strike killed al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri \u2014 agency director William J. Burns released a statement, hailing him as a \u201clegend and inspiration to every Agency officer.\"\n\nThe acknowledgment was a rare gesture. Typically, the CIA announces the death of an officer when they have been killed in the line of duty and awarded a black star engraved on its lobby\u2019s Memorial Wall. Even then, the agency only names them if their identities are deemed no longer sensitive.\n\nBut Schroen, a main character in the Pulitzer Prize-winning book \u201cGhost Wars\u201d by Steve Coll, was well-known to the world, at least among spy services, reporters and other national security types. At a memorial service at their church later this month, McFadden said, she expects several hundred to attend, many of them Langley friends or mentees.\n\nSchroen, left, and former CIA colleague Jim Lawler, now a novelist, meet up at a deli in McLean, Va., last year. Lawler based a character in his spy novel \"Living Lies\" off Schroen. (Courtesy of Jim Lawler)\n\u201cGary said [Jawbreaker] was the best thing he did in his career. It was the culmination of everything he\u2019d been trying to do,\u201d McFadden said. \u201cThere was a little bit of vengeance, but mostly, he just said, \u2018I was the right person to go.\u2019 I once asked him if he was afraid and he said, \u2018Not really.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u2018Off to a Bad Start\u2019\nSitting on her couch, McFadden pulled out her husband\u2019s papers.\n\nThe Illinois native, born Nov. 6, 1941, joined the Army Security Agency in 1959 at the age of 18.\n\nBut Schroen\u2019s career almost blew up as soon as it began, according to an unpublished story he wrote, \u201cOff to a Bad Start.\u201d When a beer bottle he had left on top of his barracks mailbox in Germany spilled all over outgoing Christmas cards and other correspondence, his enraged commanding officer threatened him with a court-martial and 25 years in prison. He was accused of \u201ctampering with the U.S. mail,\u201d Schroen wrote.\n\nThe court-martial never happened. Instead, he got busted back one grade to private E-2. Soon, after an honorable discharge in 1962, he was off to Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville. During college, where he worked side jobs as a janitor and unloading trucks for UPS, he got a letter in the mail from another three-letter agency.\n\nHe entered the CIA in June 1969 when the agency, led by Richard Helms, was combating the Soviets and running clandestine operations in southeast Asia.\n\nThe accused spy knew stealth was crucial from his work on submarines. He surfaced anyway.\n\nBut Schroen was dispatched to another part of the world. In the early 1970s, he and his first wife, Pat \u2014 their first date was seeing \u201cThe Spy Who Came In From the Cold\u201d \u2014 settled in Iran with their only child at the time, Christopher.\n\nAround then, members of the Mujahideen-e Khalq had launched several attacks against Americans in Tehran, Schroen wrote in another of his biographical stories. Under high alert, several CIA officers in Tehran were issued concealed-carry weapons.\n\nSo, one night in September 1975, Schroen wrote, he began his seven-block walk home from the embassy \u2014 armed.\n\n\u201cHe looked like any other young diplomat at the Embassy, except a closer examination would have revealed a Browning 9mm Hi-Power automatic tucked under his belt on his left side, hidden by the suit jacket,\u201d Schroen wrote of himself in the third person.\n\nWhen Schroen was about four blocks from home, he saw two Iranian men in suits, standing by a sedan. One man reached his hand into a small bag \u2014 the \u201cperfect size for a handgun,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThen, Schroen pulled out his Browning. He was going to shoot, but one of the men shook his head no, and the second man nodded. Schroen took off in a sprint.\n\n\u201cIn looking back over the years, it is clear to me that this was an MEK assassination operation targeting me,\u201d Schroen wrote. \u201cThe fact that I was alert and armed, and I drew my weapon before they could react, I am sure saved my life.\u201d\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be the last time Schroen was nearly killed.

An adjacent photo features Schroen and his colleagues on that team \u2014 its code name was \u201cJawbreaker\u201d \u2014 sporting black-and-white keffiyehs next to their helicopter, tail sign: \u201c91101.\u201d On a sideboard, 11 CIA medals, most emblazoned with the agency\u2019s seal of an eagle and a 16-point compass star, sit open in square-shaped wooden cases.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou know, he didn\u2019t talk that much about what he got the medals for,\u201d McFadden said on a recent day inside their home, where the counterintelligence specialist granted her first interview since her husband\u2019s death last month. \u201cHe had these in a drawer. I put them out.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Anne McFadden shows some CIA medals of distinction earned by Schroen. (Bill O&#39;Leary/The Washington Post)\nSchroen worked for the CIA as an operations officer and contractor for more than 50 years before dying Aug. 1 after complications from a fall outside their Alexandria home. He was 80.</p>\n\n<p>At the CIA, he managed case officers and recruited foreigners as spies and collaborators, paying them with hard cash and running covert actions against enemies abroad.</p>\n\n<p>Even though Schroen wrote an acclaimed memoir about his most legendary operation \u2014 and even though McFadden herself has worked as a CIA employee and contractor for more than 35 years \u2014 her husband\u2019s modesty and penchant for secrecy meant she only knew so much.</p>\n\n<p>But McFadden, 66, said her husband\u2019s Jawbreaker mission, which laid the groundwork for the Taliban\u2019s collapse in the fall of 2001 and the 20-year U.S. war in Afghanistan, gave Schroen the most gratification.</p>\n\n<p>The operation also helped make Schroen famous at Langley, where the Russian-made (and CIA-modified) Mi-17 that choppered the Jawbreaker team over the Hindu Kush Mountains into Afghanistan was dedicated in a ceremony in 2019 as an agency museum exhibit outside on its campus.</p>\n\n<p>When Schroen died \u2014 shortly after a CIA drone strike killed al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri \u2014 agency director William J. Burns released a statement, hailing him as a \u201clegend and inspiration to every Agency officer.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The acknowledgment was a rare gesture. Typically, the CIA announces the death of an officer when they have been killed in the line of duty and awarded a black star engraved on its lobby\u2019s Memorial Wall. Even then, the agency only names them if their identities are deemed no longer sensitive.</p>\n\n<p>But Schroen, a main character in the Pulitzer Prize-winning book \u201cGhost Wars\u201d by Steve Coll, was well-known to the world, at least among spy services, reporters and other national security types. At a memorial service at their church later this month, McFadden said, she expects several hundred to attend, many of them Langley friends or mentees.</p>\n\n<p>Schroen, left, and former CIA colleague Jim Lawler, now a novelist, meet up at a deli in McLean, Va., last year. Lawler based a character in his spy novel &quot;Living Lies&quot; off Schroen. (Courtesy of Jim Lawler)\n\u201cGary said [Jawbreaker] was the best thing he did in his career. It was the culmination of everything he\u2019d been trying to do,\u201d McFadden said. \u201cThere was a little bit of vengeance, but mostly, he just said, \u2018I was the right person to go.\u2019 I once asked him if he was afraid and he said, \u2018Not really.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u2018Off to a Bad Start\u2019\nSitting on her couch, McFadden pulled out her husband\u2019s papers.</p>\n\n<p>The Illinois native, born Nov. 6, 1941, joined the Army Security Agency in 1959 at the age of 18.</p>\n\n<p>But Schroen\u2019s career almost blew up as soon as it began, according to an unpublished story he wrote, \u201cOff to a Bad Start.\u201d When a beer bottle he had left on top of his barracks mailbox in Germany spilled all over outgoing Christmas cards and other correspondence, his enraged commanding officer threatened him with a court-martial and 25 years in prison. He was accused of \u201ctampering with the U.S. mail,\u201d Schroen wrote.</p>\n\n<p>The court-martial never happened. Instead, he got busted back one grade to private E-2. Soon, after an honorable discharge in 1962, he was off to Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville. During college, where he worked side jobs as a janitor and unloading trucks for UPS, he got a letter in the mail from another three-letter agency.</p>\n\n<p>He entered the CIA in June 1969 when the agency, led by Richard Helms, was combating the Soviets and running clandestine operations in southeast Asia.</p>\n\n<p>The accused spy knew stealth was crucial from his work on submarines. He surfaced anyway.</p>\n\n<p>But Schroen was dispatched to another part of the world. In the early 1970s, he and his first wife, Pat \u2014 their first date was seeing \u201cThe Spy Who Came In From the Cold\u201d \u2014 settled in Iran with their only child at the time, Christopher.</p>\n\n<p>Around then, members of the Mujahideen-e Khalq had launched several attacks against Americans in Tehran, Schroen wrote in another of his biographical stories. Under high alert, several CIA officers in Tehran were issued concealed-carry weapons.</p>\n\n<p>So, one night in September 1975, Schroen wrote, he began his seven-block walk home from the embassy \u2014 armed.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHe looked like any other young diplomat at the Embassy, except a closer examination would have revealed a Browning 9mm Hi-Power automatic tucked under his belt on his left side, hidden by the suit jacket,\u201d Schroen wrote of himself in the third person.</p>\n\n<p>When Schroen was about four blocks from home, he saw two Iranian men in suits, standing by a sedan. One man reached his hand into a small bag \u2014 the \u201cperfect size for a handgun,\u201d he wrote.</p>\n\n<p>Then, Schroen pulled out his Browning. He was going to shoot, but one of the men shook his head no, and the second man nodded. Schroen took off in a sprint.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIn looking back over the years, it is clear to me that this was an MEK assassination operation targeting me,\u201d Schroen wrote. \u201cThe fact that I was alert and armed, and I drew my weapon before they could react, I am sure saved my life.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>It wouldn\u2019t be the last time Schroen was nearly killed. On Nov. 21, 1979, student protesters stormed the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan, setting it on fire and trapping Schroen and many others inside. A Marine was fatally shot, but Schroen outlasted the rioters in a code room vault and left the compound physically unscathed.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf there aren\u2019t 3,000 students coming over the fence, then it\u2019s not an emergency,\u201d McFadden said her husband used to say.</p>\n\n<p>Nearly two decades later, as the chief of station in Islamabad, he helped lead a 1997 CIA-FBI operation that captured Mir Aimal Kansi, an FBI \u201cTop Ten\u201d fugitive.

I&#39;ve seen broader Russian public being described as &quot;zombified&quot; to what&#39;s happening in their country and I think they&#39;ll remain that way.</p>\n</div>",

                    "body": "> Context is important too, I'd imagine. Russia still has the largest inventory of battlefield nukes in the world and could theoretically wipe out a Ukrainian battalion in an afternoon.\n\nTheoretically. \n\nFirst, I wouldn't be surprised if Russian nukes are only 1/4 serviceable. Just by looking at the maintenance of the moskva ship.  Russia has a serious problem of \"well if it isn't needed right now, we'll just take that money\" type of corruption. I'm sure every nuclear weapon commander sells off everything that can be sold off from the nuclear fleet. Whatever it is. \n\nBut that is speculation. \n\nSecondly, nukes are not really good battlefield weapons. An 800kt weapon has a 5psi blast radius of about 6km. So it can really only destroy about 12km of a front. The Kherson front is ~240km, so they'd need to deploy ~20 of those nukes to hit the entire front. That's a lot of nukes. Granted, they can probably focus on concentrated areas and yeah, probably knock out ~1000 soldiers in an attack (until they disperse). But after their first attack, the remaining soldiers will disperse and change tactics. A nuclear weapon won't be all that effective at hitting battlefield soldiers.

So knocking out 10-50 Ukrainian BTGs would give Russia the capability to maybe stop an attack or maybe even start their own counter offensive. However, it would signal Europe and probably NATO that they have to engage in this war. And Russia would lose a war against NATO in weeks. \n\nFour, using the nukes would deplete Russia's stockpiles of deployable nuclear weapons. How bad would it be? That's a good question.

                    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>Context is important too, I&#39;d imagine. Russia still has the largest inventory of battlefield nukes in the world and could theoretically wipe out a Ukrainian battalion in an afternoon.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Theoretically. </p>\n\n<p>First, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Russian nukes are only 1/4 serviceable. Just by looking at the maintenance of the moskva ship.  Russia has a serious problem of &quot;well if it isn&#39;t needed right now, we&#39;ll just take that money&quot; type of corruption. I&#39;m sure every nuclear weapon commander sells off everything that can be sold off from the nuclear fleet. Whatever it is. </p>\n\n<p>But that is speculation. </p>\n\n<p>Secondly, nukes are not really good battlefield weapons. An 800kt weapon has a 5psi blast radius of about 6km. So it can really only destroy about 12km of a front. The Kherson front is ~240km, so they&#39;d need to deploy ~20 of those nukes to hit the entire front. That&#39;s a lot of nukes. Granted, they can probably focus on concentrated areas and yeah, probably knock out ~1000 soldiers in an attack (until they disperse). But after their first attack, the remaining soldiers will disperse and change tactics. A nuclear weapon won&#39;t be all that effective at hitting battlefield soldiers.

Then, they should show it by example.</p>\n\n<p>They can mobilize their kids</p>\n\n<p>So the Russian army couldn&#39;t do it, but civilians who don&#39;t know how to carry firearms will??? Smells like embarrassment. Even this suggestion discredits the army and signifies some kind of fiasco IMO</p>\n\n<p>They can mobilize the immigrants))) And leave the men to feed their families</p>\n\n<p>Why doesn&#39;t this proactive deputy go as a volunteer himself? He can show a great example!</p>\n\n<p>He should take off his immunity and go to the conscription office himself! Doesn&#39;t take much to blabber!!!!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have no doubt some will proudly go to defend their country, but never forget the old-as-USSR sense of self-preservation above anything else.</p>\n</div>",
