The worse than expected performance of Russia along with the pre existing tensions will likely embolden American politicians and diplomats to be tougher on China. The collapse of the Soviet Union (which left the US/NATO as the default &quot;winner&quot; of the Cold War), the Gulf War, and other relatively successful US/NATO military interventions in the 1990s undoubtedly led to some overconfidence (more hawkish rhetoric) with the invasion of Afghanistan and later Iraq, with politicians believing that it would be just as simple and easy.</p>\n</div>",

                            "body": "> With the blood and suffering of how many people in their relative countries where those \u201c minor \u201c wars?\n\n\n10-30 million deaths maybe, if we want to include not just those who died directly from combat, but also from flow on effects like famine. \n\n\nThat's a pretty big improvement over the previous 70 years, where the first and second world wars (which notably weren't prevented by US diplomacy due to the isolationist stance of the US) resulted in easily over 100 million deaths. That's not even taking into account the Chinese, Russian, or Spanish civil wars which could probably add another 10 million on to that total. \n\n\nThe world population now is about three times larger than it was in 1950, so the US has kept this lower rate of conflict deaths even though the world population has boomed. \n\n\n> Tell that to all those Balkan, Middle-Eastern, North African, East-Asian and South-American countries which had to deal with direct consequences of US interventions.\n\n\nI can and will. Overall, the world is healthier, wealthier, and happier than it was 70 years ago. Diplomacy has winners and losers, but overall the US has helped to foster global stability that has resulted in measurable improvements to the standard of living for people in almost every county in the world. Countries like Vietnam, Bosnia, Egypt, Colombia, and Iraq are all measurably better off over the last 70 years than they were in the 70 years before that. \n\n\n> The only result of all that is that US and more specifically the greedy elite inside of it has egregiously amassed all those benefits for themselves, not even their subjects, demonstrating only the worst possible traits of uncontrolled capitalism, ironically also demonstrating why competition in simple economic terms is the best tool of capitalism itself.\n\n\n As Churchill said \"Capitalism is the worst economic system \u2014 except for all the others that have been tried.\" This is straying a little far from diplomacy, so I'll leave it at that. \n\n\n> Until we figure out how to get to a fully global union, the multipolar world is the best we can get by with. \n\n\nI honestly don't think that the data bears this out. If we want to compare unipolar to bipolar, the last 30 years (after the collapse of the USSR) have been amongst the most peaceful in human history. \n\n\n> US folks have to understand that their culture and influence are not welcomed in a rather large portion of the world.\n\n\nAgain, based on what? The US has had probably the biggest cultural impact of any single nation in history over the last 70 years. In the marketplace of ideas, they have dominated because people want what the US has to offer. If they didn't, they'd go somewhere else. \n\n\n> My personal opinion is that US should literally avoid intertwining itself with every single conflict on this planet. \n\n\nLike they did in the 30s? Remind me again how that turned out? \n\n\n>Their interventions only prolong or worsen any conflict that might die off promptly. Good example would be the Nagorno-Karabakh war where neither superpower took actions and the war ended definitively.\n\n\nMate, the Nagorno-Karabakh war is probably the last example that you want to use. It has been the site of low intensity conflict since the 90s. The only reason that there hasn't been any further conflict since October 2022 is because the EU has deployed a peacekeeping force. Once the EU troops leave I give it less than 12 months until violence erupts again.\n\nTl;dr - The US isn't perfect, but it skilfully uses diplomacy to reduce global tensions.",
                            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>With the blood and suffering of how many people in their relative countries where those \u201c minor \u201c wars?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>10-30 million deaths maybe, if we want to include not just those who died directly from combat, but also from flow on effects like famine. </p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s a pretty big improvement over the previous 70 years, where the first and second world wars (which notably weren&#39;t prevented by US diplomacy due to the isolationist stance of the US) resulted in easily over 100 million deaths. That&#39;s not even taking into account the Chinese, Russian, or Spanish civil wars which could probably add another 10 million on to that total. </p>\n\n<p>The world population now is about three times larger than it was in 1950, so the US has kept this lower rate of conflict deaths even though the world population has boomed. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Tell that to all those Balkan, Middle-Eastern, North African, East-Asian and South-American countries which had to deal with direct consequences of US interventions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I can and will. Overall, the world is healthier, wealthier, and happier than it was 70 years ago. Diplomacy has winners and losers, but overall the US has helped to foster global stability that has resulted in measurable improvements to the standard of living for people in almost every county in the world. Countries like Vietnam, Bosnia, Egypt, Colombia, and Iraq are all measurably better off over the last 70 years than they were in the 70 years before that. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The only result of all that is that US and more specifically the greedy elite inside of it has egregiously amassed all those benefits for themselves, not even their subjects, demonstrating only the worst possible traits of uncontrolled capitalism, ironically also demonstrating why competition in simple economic terms is the best tool of capitalism itself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As Churchill said &quot;Capitalism is the worst economic system \u2014 except for all the others that have been tried.&quot; This is straying a little far from diplomacy, so I&#39;ll leave it at that. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Until we figure out how to get to a fully global union, the multipolar world is the best we can get by with. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I honestly don&#39;t think that the data bears this out. If we want to compare unipolar to bipolar, the last 30 years (after the collapse of the USSR) have been amongst the most peaceful in human history. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>US folks have to understand that their culture and influence are not welcomed in a rather large portion of the world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Again, based on what? The US has had probably the biggest cultural impact of any single nation in history over the last 70 years. In the marketplace of ideas, they have dominated because people want what the US has to offer. If they didn&#39;t, they&#39;d go somewhere else. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>My personal opinion is that US should literally avoid intertwining itself with every single conflict on this planet. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Like they did in the 30s? Remind me again how that turned out? </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Their interventions only prolong or worsen any conflict that might die off promptly. Good example would be the Nagorno-Karabakh war where neither superpower took actions and the war ended definitively.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Mate, the Nagorno-Karabakh war is probably the last example that you want to use. It has been the site of low intensity conflict since the 90s. The only reason that there hasn&#39;t been any further conflict since October 2022 is because the EU has deployed a peacekeeping force. Once the EU troops leave I give it less than 12 months until violence erupts again.</p>\n\n<p>Tl;dr - The US isn&#39;t perfect, but it skilfully uses diplomacy to reduce global tensions.</p>\n</div>",

The later was going to get tough to enforce as missile technology advanced and the US was building systems to counter Iran and the DPRK.\n\nThe STARTs, SALT etc type treaties cut down number for the 30 000 or whatever of the 70s No one is going to build that nonsense again so this is more of a flex than a real move. The arms control wonks might have a different view to the hot take I just dropped.

I can even quote the 2021 textbook.  \n\n\n\n> For the security of the Soviet Union it was extremely important that Finland did not become an ally of Germany or at least that its territory was not used for the deployment of German troops or troops of other states for the purpose of attacking the USSR from the northwest. During negotiations with the government of Finland Stalin offered to exchange a part of territory of the Karelian Isthmus, where the border lied some 32 km from Leningrad, for twice as much territory of the Soviet Karelia.

Not to mention US troops or assets would undoubtedly be caught up in the fight\n\n> Hard to ignore the efforts that trump took to undermine nato and our allies in europe, and rumored to go as far as musing about US leaving nato.\n\nTrump was all about his weird 'art of the deal' mentality. He liked strongarming everyone to improve his perceived position.

I don't think it's legislative restriction, but more legislative apathy towards increasing production. \n\nThe estimates are that the Lima Tank Plant produces 12-15 Abrams a month - so generously 150 Abrams per year. Currently there are 336 Polish Abrams and 75 Australian Abrams that are in line as well as roughly 100 Army Abrams over the next 4 years. So that's roughly 500 Abrams over the next 4 years. That's 3 years of capacity spoken for over the next 4 years. Add in the already committed 31 Abrams, and it's about 3.5 years of capacity. \n\nThe article on the plant that came out a few days ago said they could - with funding - double that production, and adding a third shift produce even more. So let's say they go from 150 to 300 to 375 produced per year by Jan 1, 2024. Sounds great, right? Knock out Australia's order in 2023, Poland's in 2024, and all while slowly supplying Ukraine with tank battalions that they can train and integrate over late 2023 and early 2024.\n\nBut the question is: what then? The US has spent all this money to increase production, and now has fulfilled all its paying customers with only Ukraine as a not paying customer left. There's no guarantee they'll get more customers to make that production amount worthwhile, and Ukraine surely won't be paying during the war, or likely even after it. \n\nSo what does the US do now it's got a tank plant that's even a bigger cost on the budget and a new not-light tank to procure? Downgrade the production capacity? Not without creating a parts shortage. See if it can speed run upgrading all its stored Abrams? Even more money. See if they can force GDLS to make the MPF there? Maybe. \n\nAnd that's why I say it's legislative apathy towards increasing production because except for like Sherrod Brown and Rob Portman (Ohio's Senators), there no appetite to invest to increase production for two, maybe three years of orders.",

So let&#39;s say they go from 150 to 300 to 375 produced per year by Jan 1, 2024. Sounds great, right? Knock out Australia&#39;s order in 2023, Poland&#39;s in 2024, and all while slowly supplying Ukraine with tank battalions that they can train and integrate over late 2023 and early 2024.</p>\n\n<p>But the question is: what then? The US has spent all this money to increase production, and now has fulfilled all its paying customers with only Ukraine as a not paying customer left. There&#39;s no guarantee they&#39;ll get more customers to make that production amount worthwhile, and Ukraine surely won&#39;t be paying during the war, or likely even after it. </p>\n\n<p>So what does the US do now it&#39;s got a tank plant that&#39;s even a bigger cost on the budget and a new not-light tank to procure? Downgrade the production capacity? Not without creating a parts shortage. See if it can speed run upgrading all its stored Abrams? Even more money. See if they can force GDLS to make the MPF there? Maybe. </p>\n\n<p>And that&#39;s why I say it&#39;s legislative apathy towards increasing production because except for like Sherrod Brown and Rob Portman (Ohio&#39;s Senators), there no appetite to invest to increase production for two, maybe three years of orders.</p>\n</div>",

                "body": "It was envisioned as the centerpiece of a $200 billion program revolutionizing how the US Army would fight. Now it\u2019s languishing in storage in Virginia, a 25-ton symbol of the malaise that lies at the nexus of the Pentagon and the defense industry.\n\nThe Non-Line-of-Sight Cannon (NLOS-C), a self-propelled 155mm howitzer on tank tracks, was integral to Army plans to develop the kind of high-tech system that would help offset the numerical advantages of a peer like China or Russia in a future conflict.\n\nIt was part of an ambitious concept to replace combat units with a family of ground and air vehicles, both manned and robotic, all networked wirelessly.\n\nOnly it was too ambitious: the so-called Future Combat Systems program was plagued by technology issues, slips in schedule and ballooning costs. By the time the NLOS-C was put on show on the National Mall in Washington in 2008 as part of the Army\u2019s charm offensive on Capitol Hill, doubts were already beginning to form.\n\n\u201cWe were under such pressure to finish the assembly and integration on time, we were putting parts together that had never been assembled before,\u201d recalls Mark Signorelli, who worked for contractors United Defense and later BAE Systems, which developed the NLOS-C.\n\nIn 2009, after spending $20 billion in eight years with little to show for it, the Pentagon canceled Future Combat Systems \u2014 run by Boeing Co. and SAIC \u2014 to avert what then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates termed a \u201ccostly disaster.\u201d\n\nThe collapse of what was the largest and most ambitious acquisition program in Army history illustrates how the defense industrial base that has underpinned US military primacy for decades is misfiring. Munitions shortages, failed audits and surveillance gaps exposed by the Chinese balloon ultimately shot down off South Carolina suggest that America\u2019s military-industrial complex may no longer be fit for purpose.\n\nAs Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine enters a second year, and China relations plumb new depths over flashpoints from Taiwan to semiconductors, that reality raises serious questions about US readiness to fight a war. \n\n\u201cWe have a defense industrial base that\u2019s built to achieve first-level deterrence by virtue of the world class platforms we have deployed,\u201d said Roy Kamphausen, a former China strategist for the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and now president of the National Bureau of Asian Research. \u201cBut there are serious questions about how we would sustain ourselves in a high-intensity conventional conflict of more than a few weeks in duration.\u201d\n\nAfter decades of consolidation, the industry suffers from a paucity of competition and lacks the kind of \u201csurge capacity\u201d needed to wage major industrial wars. Cost overruns are routine. And a culture of risk aversion rules from the Pentagon to the boardrooms of defense industry giants. \n\nOne upshot: the scrapping of Future Combat Systems means that more than a decade later the US Army has yet to develop a replacement for its Cold War-era armored vehicles \u2014 the Abrams tank and the Bradley Fighting Vehicle.\n\nOr take hypersonic missiles, a field in which the US once held a strong technological lead as far back as the 1960s. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) began a program to design hypersonic weapons in the early 2000s, only to halt it following a series of early failed tests.\n\nSpin forward to summer 2021, when China conducted two hypersonic weapons tests, including the launch into space of an orbiting weapon capable of carrying a nuclear payload, alarming military planners in Washington. The fast, low-flying and highly maneuverable weapons represent a potential threat to the homeland, since they could be used to send nuclear warheads over the South Pole and around US anti-missile systems.\n\nYet the tests also spoke to a deeper concern that the US may have chronically underestimated China\u2019s ability to deliver innovative technologies to its military.\n\nThe moment encapsulated a failure of the Defense Department to transition critical technologies in R&D to production, with the result that \u201cin the interim, Russia and China caught up,\u201d said Mich\u00e8le Flournoy, a former Undersecretary of Defense for Policy. \u201cNow we are playing catch up.\u201d\n\nLast summer brought another wake-up call. As Washington sent Ukraine Javelin anti-tank missiles and Stinger surface-to-air missiles, along with howitzers and ammunition, it began to deplete its own stockpiles, demonstrating its own lack of resilience.\n\nA third shock as regards US ability to counter China is only now dawning, according to Flournoy, a potential future contender for Secretary of Defense: the presence of Chinese-made components throughout defense supply chains that create \u201cunacceptable dependencies if not vulnerabilities.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost prime contractors can\u2019t even tell you how much Chinese content is in their systems, ranging from semiconductors to displays to nuts and bolts,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Defense Department acknowledged that the defense industrial base faces many of the same supply-chain challenges as other sectors. \u201cLead times from ordering a component to delivery drive production timelines,\u201d said spokesman Jeff Jurgensen. \u201cTo offset long lead times, the Department is making sustained investments to expand production capacity and stockpile critical weapons and materials.\u201d\n\nThe defense industry\u2019s problems have crystallized into a matter of urgency over the last 18 months, but they date back decades. \n\nIn the wake of the Soviet Union\u2019s fall, US politicians hoped to cash in on the \u201cpeace dividend,\u201d the promise of economic benefits from reduced defense spending. Then-Deputy Secretary of Defense William Perry laid out what this would mean for the industry at a dinner now known as the \u201clast supper,\u201d in which he told executives to consolidate or face extinction. \n\nConsolidate they did. The defense sector has moved from more than 70 aerospace and defense \u201cprime contractors\u201d that worked directly with the government in 1980 to just 5 by the early 2000s, the same number as today: Lockheed Martin Corp., Raytheon Technologies Corp., General Dynamics Corp., Northrop Grumman Corp., and Boeing.\n\n\u201cNot too many years ago, we had five times as many contractors and there was more competition and there was more creativity,\u201d said Representative Ken Calvert, the California Republican at the helm of the House\u2019s defense spending panel. \u201cAs these larger guys kept buying the smaller guys coming up with the ideas, and then encapsulate them and restructure, it\u2019s taken a lot of the innovation out.\u201d\n\nEven some major projects end up with just one bidder. In 2019, Boeing declined to compete for a Pentagon program to develop and procure a next-generation intercontinental ballistic missile because it viewed the tender as heavily skewed in Northrop Grumman\u2019s favor, leaving Northrop as the sole bidder for the nearly $85 billion project.\n\nThe dearth of contractors and rigid requirements from their single customer, the Pentagon, helps contribute to the cost overruns that have become synonymous with the industry. One prominent example is the Navy\u2019s Littoral Combat Ship. What Navy leaders had touted as a 55-vessel fleet costing $220 million per ship has dwindled to 35 costing on average $478 million apiece. \n\nThat\u2019s nothing compared with the F-35. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter \u2014 the world\u2019s most expensive weapons program \u2014 is projected to cost $1.7 trillion over its 66-year lifetime, roughly equivalent to the nominal GDP of Russia. Despite its eyewatering price tag, the jet is still plagued by deficient software.\n\nThese overruns are baked into the system. Like many defense projects, the F-35 is intricately bound up with US domestic politics. Nearly every state has economic ties to the project, with 29 states counting on it for $100 million or more in economic activity. The F-35 directly and indirectly creates about 250,000 jobs in 45 states and Puerto Rico, according to Lockheed Martin.\n\nThe tortured process of defense acquisition has squeezed creativity from the system and made it difficult to deliver innovation. A 2021 Hudson Institute study argued that the time it takes for the Defense Department to go from identifying a need to awarding a contract has increased from about one year in 1950 to seven years today. For innovative systems, such as the F-35, it can take another 21 years to become operational.\n\nChina, by contrast, is able to deliver capabilities far more quickly. In a July 2021 address, Maj. Gen. Cameron Holt, then deputy assistant secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, estimated that China is procuring munitions and other high-end weapons systems \u201cfive-to-six-times\u201d faster than the US. \n\nAt the nub of the problem is the Pentagon\u2019s planning, programming, budgeting and execution process, known as PPBE. It controls the resources that make weapons programs happen, but such is its reputation that Congress created a commission to overhaul the process. It\u2019s due to report this year.\n\n\u201cThe Pentagon is such a huge bureaucracy and the budgeting process and acquisition processes are really long, very slow, very cumbersome and very linear,\u201d said Stacie Pettyjohn with the Center for a New American Security. \u201cYou\u2019re not really rewarded for taking risks.\u201d",
                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>It was envisioned as the centerpiece of a $200 billion program revolutionizing how the US Army would fight. Now it\u2019s languishing in storage in Virginia, a 25-ton symbol of the malaise that lies at the nexus of the Pentagon and the defense industry.</p>\n\n<p>The Non-Line-of-Sight Cannon (NLOS-C), a self-propelled 155mm howitzer on tank tracks, was integral to Army plans to develop the kind of high-tech system that would help offset the numerical advantages of a peer like China or Russia in a future conflict.</p>\n\n<p>It was part of an ambitious concept to replace combat units with a family of ground and air vehicles, both manned and robotic, all networked wirelessly.</p>\n\n<p>Only it was too ambitious: the so-called Future Combat Systems program was plagued by technology issues, slips in schedule and ballooning costs. By the time the NLOS-C was put on show on the National Mall in Washington in 2008 as part of the Army\u2019s charm offensive on Capitol Hill, doubts were already beginning to form.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe were under such pressure to finish the assembly and integration on time, we were putting parts together that had never been assembled before,\u201d recalls Mark Signorelli, who worked for contractors United Defense and later BAE Systems, which developed the NLOS-C.</p>\n\n<p>In 2009, after spending $20 billion in eight years with little to show for it, the Pentagon canceled Future Combat Systems \u2014 run by Boeing Co. and SAIC \u2014 to avert what then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates termed a \u201ccostly disaster.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The collapse of what was the largest and most ambitious acquisition program in Army history illustrates how the defense industrial base that has underpinned US military primacy for decades is misfiring. Munitions shortages, failed audits and surveillance gaps exposed by the Chinese balloon ultimately shot down off South Carolina suggest that America\u2019s military-industrial complex may no longer be fit for purpose.</p>\n\n<p>As Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine enters a second year, and China relations plumb new depths over flashpoints from Taiwan to semiconductors, that reality raises serious questions about US readiness to fight a war. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe have a defense industrial base that\u2019s built to achieve first-level deterrence by virtue of the world class platforms we have deployed,\u201d said Roy Kamphausen, a former China strategist for the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and now president of the National Bureau of Asian Research. \u201cBut there are serious questions about how we would sustain ourselves in a high-intensity conventional conflict of more than a few weeks in duration.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>After decades of consolidation, the industry suffers from a paucity of competition and lacks the kind of \u201csurge capacity\u201d needed to wage major industrial wars. Cost overruns are routine. And a culture of risk aversion rules from the Pentagon to the boardrooms of defense industry giants. </p>\n\n<p>One upshot: the scrapping of Future Combat Systems means that more than a decade later the US Army has yet to develop a replacement for its Cold War-era armored vehicles \u2014 the Abrams tank and the Bradley Fighting Vehicle.</p>\n\n<p>Or take hypersonic missiles, a field in which the US once held a strong technological lead as far back as the 1960s. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) began a program to design hypersonic weapons in the early 2000s, only to halt it following a series of early failed tests.</p>\n\n<p>Spin forward to summer 2021, when China conducted two hypersonic weapons tests, including the launch into space of an orbiting weapon capable of carrying a nuclear payload, alarming military planners in Washington. The fast, low-flying and highly maneuverable weapons represent a potential threat to the homeland, since they could be used to send nuclear warheads over the South Pole and around US anti-missile systems.</p>\n\n<p>Yet the tests also spoke to a deeper concern that the US may have chronically underestimated China\u2019s ability to deliver innovative technologies to its military.</p>\n\n<p>The moment encapsulated a failure of the Defense Department to transition critical technologies in R&amp;D to production, with the result that \u201cin the interim, Russia and China caught up,\u201d said Mich\u00e8le Flournoy, a former Undersecretary of Defense for Policy. \u201cNow we are playing catch up.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Last summer brought another wake-up call. As Washington sent Ukraine Javelin anti-tank missiles and Stinger surface-to-air missiles, along with howitzers and ammunition, it began to deplete its own stockpiles, demonstrating its own lack of resilience.</p>\n\n<p>A third shock as regards US ability to counter China is only now dawning, according to Flournoy, a potential future contender for Secretary of Defense: the presence of Chinese-made components throughout defense supply chains that create \u201cunacceptable dependencies if not vulnerabilities.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMost prime contractors can\u2019t even tell you how much Chinese content is in their systems, ranging from semiconductors to displays to nuts and bolts,\u201d she said.</p>\n\n<p>The Defense Department acknowledged that the defense industrial base faces many of the same supply-chain challenges as other sectors. \u201cLead times from ordering a component to delivery drive production timelines,\u201d said spokesman Jeff Jurgensen. \u201cTo offset long lead times, the Department is making sustained investments to expand production capacity and stockpile critical weapons and materials.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The defense industry\u2019s problems have crystallized into a matter of urgency over the last 18 months, but they date back decades. </p>\n\n<p>In the wake of the Soviet Union\u2019s fall, US politicians hoped to cash in on the \u201cpeace dividend,\u201d the promise of economic benefits from reduced defense spending. Then-Deputy Secretary of Defense William Perry laid out what this would mean for the industry at a dinner now known as the \u201clast supper,\u201d in which he told executives to consolidate or face extinction. </p>\n\n<p>Consolidate they did. The defense sector has moved from more than 70 aerospace and defense \u201cprime contractors\u201d that worked directly with the government in 1980 to just 5 by the early 2000s, the same number as today: Lockheed Martin Corp., Raytheon Technologies Corp., General Dynamics Corp., Northrop Grumman Corp., and Boeing.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNot too many years ago, we had five times as many contractors and there was more competition and there was more creativity,\u201d said Representative Ken Calvert, the California Republican at the helm of the House\u2019s defense spending panel. \u201cAs these larger guys kept buying the smaller guys coming up with the ideas, and then encapsulate them and restructure, it\u2019s taken a lot of the innovation out.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Even some major projects end up with just one bidder. In 2019, Boeing declined to compete for a Pentagon program to develop and procure a next-generation intercontinental ballistic missile because it viewed the tender as heavily skewed in Northrop Grumman\u2019s favor, leaving Northrop as the sole bidder for the nearly $85 billion project.</p>\n\n<p>The dearth of contractors and rigid requirements from their single customer, the Pentagon, helps contribute to the cost overruns that have become synonymous with the industry. One prominent example is the Navy\u2019s Littoral Combat Ship. What Navy leaders had touted as a 55-vessel fleet costing $220 million per ship has dwindled to 35 costing on average $478 million apiece. </p>\n\n<p>That\u2019s nothing compared with the F-35. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter \u2014 the world\u2019s most expensive weapons program \u2014 is projected to cost $1.7 trillion over its 66-year lifetime, roughly equivalent to the nominal GDP of Russia. Despite its eyewatering price tag, the jet is still plagued by deficient software.</p>\n\n<p>These overruns are baked into the system. Like many defense projects, the F-35 is intricately bound up with US domestic politics. Nearly every state has economic ties to the project, with 29 states counting on it for $100 million or more in economic activity. The F-35 directly and indirectly creates about 250,000 jobs in 45 states and Puerto Rico, according to Lockheed Martin.</p>\n\n<p>The tortured process of defense acquisition has squeezed creativity from the system and made it difficult to deliver innovation. A 2021 Hudson Institute study argued that the time it takes for the Defense Department to go from identifying a need to awarding a contract has increased from about one year in 1950 to seven years today. For innovative systems, such as the F-35, it can take another 21 years to become operational.</p>\n\n<p>China, by contrast, is able to deliver capabilities far more quickly. In a July 2021 address, Maj. Gen. Cameron Holt, then deputy assistant secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, estimated that China is procuring munitions and other high-end weapons systems \u201cfive-to-six-times\u201d faster than the US. </p>\n\n<p>At the nub of the problem is the Pentagon\u2019s planning, programming, budgeting and execution process, known as PPBE. It controls the resources that make weapons programs happen, but such is its reputation that Congress created a commission to overhaul the process. It\u2019s due to report this year.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe Pentagon is such a huge bureaucracy and the budgeting process and acquisition processes are really long, very slow, very cumbersome and very linear,\u201d said Stacie Pettyjohn with the Center for a New American Security. \u201cYou\u2019re not really rewarded for taking risks.\u201d</p>\n</div>",

The Titanium Metals Corporation (TIMET), for example, is the last remaining US producer of titanium sponge, necessary for the manufacture of military engines and airframes to armor for America\u2019s main battle tank.\n\nIn September 2022, the Pentagon halted deliveries of the F-35 after finding an alloy used in magnets for pumps made by Honeywell International Inc. was made in China.

Russia is far more integrated with the outside world than the Soviet Union ever was (current sanctions notwithstanding). Tensions in Europe over Ukraine have little threat of global spillover and are *mostly* contained to Europe. In the Cold War, a security situation in, say, Hungary, would lead to a *global* alert for both Soviet and NATO forces - indeed, Cold Warriors often talk about the interconnectedness of affairs (during the Korean War, for example, the US had legitimate debates over whether the war was a distraction to get the US to commit troops to Korea, leaving Europe defenceless). Finally, the current period lacks the ideological bifurcation of the Cold War: yes, there are differences in how Russia / China view the liberal international order, but *nothing* on the scale of the divide between the USSR and NATO. The current \"cold war\" is really about Russia's *survival* as a great power in the current international order and an attempt to maintain the dying remnants of the Russian empire.\n\n\"Cold War\" unfortunately is becoming a catch-all term to describe any conflict that isn't yet hot, but in this case I think it's a misnomer.

Russia is far more integrated with the outside world than the Soviet Union ever was (current sanctions notwithstanding). Tensions in Europe over Ukraine have little threat of global spillover and are <em>mostly</em> contained to Europe. In the Cold War, a security situation in, say, Hungary, would lead to a <em>global</em> alert for both Soviet and NATO forces - indeed, Cold Warriors often talk about the interconnectedness of affairs (during the Korean War, for example, the US had legitimate debates over whether the war was a distraction to get the US to commit troops to Korea, leaving Europe defenceless). Finally, the current period lacks the ideological bifurcation of the Cold War: yes, there are differences in how Russia / China view the liberal international order, but <em>nothing</em> on the scale of the divide between the USSR and NATO. The current &quot;cold war&quot; is really about Russia&#39;s <em>survival</em> as a great power in the current international order and an attempt to maintain the dying remnants of the Russian empire.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Cold War&quot; unfortunately is becoming a catch-all term to describe any conflict that isn&#39;t yet hot, but in this case I think it&#39;s a misnomer.

In Xi\u2019s case, his cuckoo got too big compared to the warblers to nourish it, and is running into serious economic problems. </p>\n\n<p>The term Cold War presumes a standoff between equals. But the cuckoo is not the equal to the warbler, and cannot sustain an ecosystem on its own.</p>\n</div>",

And in exchange, Zelenskyy should be told to accept a new boundary with Russia and call a truce.\n\nI disagree with this idea, but I thought it would be a good idea to share it, if only as a reminder that these kinds of perspectives still exist. I disagree for the following basic reasons:\n\n- The authors write that the current situation is becoming \"untenable\". \"Simply sending more armored vehicles to Ukraine without a clear calculus behind it will only mean pushing Ukrainian forces into a death trap of a war of attrition, with a country with 11 time zones and a historical willingness to throw as many bodies at a problem as possible.\" While there is no denying that the war is turning into a war of attrition, you don't win a war of attrition by putting down the weights before your competitor. If the Western industrial base can produce the equipment the Ukrainians need faster than the Russian industrial base can produce the equipment the Russians need, then Russia will be the first to break. If the situation really is untenable, then my opinion is that we should let it go on until something breaks and the untenability of the situation is realized. I think both sides' breaking points are still far off, but that Russia's breaking point is nonetheless closer than Ukraine's. I also disagree with the assertion that Russia can win simply because it supposedly has more men to throw at the problem. I'm not sure this is even correct, despite the fact that Russia's population, on paper, is larger than Ukraine's. Ukraine still has tens of millions of people, and millions of men it can potentially rely upon, while the Russian government is scratching the bottom of the barrel to find able-bodied conscripts, such as prisons. Ukrainian personnel are simply better trained and equipped, so a one-to-one comparison between both forces in presence would miss crucial elements. When an army can use force multipliers like drones and superior command and control, intelligence and reconnaissance, as Ukraine is successfully doing, ORBATs go out the window.\n\n- The authors are too impatient. Accurate or not, it is a trope among foes of the US that the US doesn't have the guts for a prolonged engagement, that its electorate recoils at the prospect of putting its soldiers in harms' way, that the country has a low tolerance for pain. The United States has proven this wrong many times, but pushing Ukraine to negotiate away its territory in return for modern aircraft would feed into this trope. Imagine if the United States pressured the United Kingdom to negotiate a peace treaty with Germany at the height of the Battle of Britain. If it takes ten years and $500 billion of military assistance to defeat Russia, then that's what it shall take. If the Ukrainians want to enter into peace negotiations, that is their right and responsibility, but they should be the only ones to make that decision.",

There are warning signs but either side can change direction of they are willing, China can turn to democracy or at least away from more dictatorial directions. The US can say that empire building and genocide is okay. Neither of them will, but it isnt like sepf perpetuating. Both sides make a decesions every day.</p>\n</div>",

Submarines are a threat but given, today, the limited places they can re-arm the threat is somewhat limited. To &quot;bomb shipbuilding back into the stone age&quot; you would need a sustained air campaign , which would require air superiority, something that is unlikely over Mainland China.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>There no merchant traffic threat if the USN beats the PLAN. The blockade would be broken instantly after a Midway style battle.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Merchant ships won&#39;t go into waters that <em>might</em> be mined, or attacked by long range missiles at any moment. You would need to escort every ship, mine sweep and provide anti-missile protection. The USN doesn&#39;t have the assets to do that in perpetuity. </p>\n\n<p>The Chinese are patient , they can out-build the USN and replace losses that would create a <em>generational</em> problem for the USN in about 10 years.</p>\n</div>",
