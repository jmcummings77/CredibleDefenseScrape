This document is part of the ATP 7-100 series that addresses a nation-state\u2019s military doctrine with a focus on army ground forces and tactical operations in offense, defense, and related mission sets. Other foundational topics include task organization, capabilities, and limitations related to military mission and support functions. ATP 7-100.3 serves as a foundation for understanding how Chinese ground forces think and act in tactical operations. This publication presents multiple examples of functional tactics in dynamic operational environment conditions. The tactics in this ATP are descriptive, and provide an orientation to tactics gathered from Chinese doctrine, translated literature, and observations from recent historical events.\n\nA link to the entire report in a PDF:\n\nhttps://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/DR_pubs/DR_a/ARN33195-ATP_7-100.3-000-WEB-1.pdf\n\nHere is an Audiobook version, so you can listen to it:\n\nhttps://rdl.train.army.mil/catalog-ws/view/ATP7-100.3Audiobook/index.html\n\nThe guest is part of the team that created the official document for the US Army, and will have a reddit flair on their username that distinguishes them as being verified by the mod team.

In addition to relocating our scenarios to East Asian and Eastern European battlefields, MCCC rebuilt our scenario threats to reflect the modernizing armies of China and Russia while remaining decisive action training environment (DATE) compliant. Now, over 60% of MCCC\u2019s scenarios feature DATE threat actors resembling the Chinese formations described in ATP 7-100.3 Chinese Tactics. The remaining 40% of our tactical scenarios are based on the current Russian military, and MCCC plans to design a similar foundational block on the Russian Army upon the publication of ATP 7-100.1 Russian Tactics. There is far more work to be done in educating students on Chinese and Russian tactics to a level at which we understood the Soviets, and this represents a considerable area of expansion for MCCC in 2022. \n\n----------------\n\n*Episode 24 - Chinese Threat Doctrine Part 1*\n\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-24-chinese-threat-doctrine-part-1/id1522992251?i=1000554217149\n\n> In this episode of Breaking Doctrine, our host, Major Rich Diegel discusses the is Army Techniques Publication (ATP) 7-100.3, Chinese Tactics, the first offering in a series of threat-specific doctrine produced by the TRADOC G2.

Despite that, it's still limited to cyclic rate of fire in emergences only, rapid rate only for two minutes before barrel change (with only one spare barrel), and sustained rate being half of the rapid rate, which is 1/3 to 1/5 the cyclic rate. It also weighs about 25 lbs (depending on model), making it a boat anchor for mobility.\n\n[This is the MK-48/FN Maxima](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mk_48_machine_gun), an enlarged M249/FN Minimi designed to fire 7.62 NATO but be light enough to classify as a light machine gun. Those became very popular in Afghanistan, because the -48 was lighter than the -240B or -240G, giving a lighter 7.62 NATO machine gun. However, that weight came with compromises, it was less sturdily built so the barrel is thinner and heats up quicker than a -240 and the internals wear out far faster, requiring a total rebuild every 15,000 rounds.\n\nThe MK-48 isn't a worse machine gun because it can't be abused with the rate of fire like an M240 can be, which likewise can't be fired like a water cooled machine gun can be. The -48's usefulness was being lighter but it came at a cost, a tradeoff that the gunner must recognize and accept or else their machine gun shits the bed and they spend the firefight twiddling their thumbs.\n\nArtillery is no different. Every piece has different rates of fire that arent suggestions or recommendations, they're known limits found out in testing. They vary depending on the piece, round type, charge. For example, the M777 with full charge can do 5-8 rpm in emergencies, 4 rpm as rapid for only a few minutes, and sustained fire of only 2 rpm. Go beyond that and it breaks, then t's not the guns fault, it's user-error.",

The Chinese equivalent of the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve is (also) named the [Strategic Petroleum Reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_petroleum_reserve_(China)) and holds a similar number of oil barrels (\\~500 million) as its U.S. counterpart.\n\nA second major mistake is found a little further in the article. Quote:\n\n\"*(...) the PLAN is still largely manned by conscripts (...)*\"\n\nProblem is, the PLAN isn't \"largely manned\" by conscripts because... China doesn't enforce conscription. War on the Rocks has a detailed article on the [Chinese system](https://warontherocks.com/2020/07/people-win-wars-the-pla-enlisted-force-and-other-related-matters/).

Those so-called conscripts are actually *volunteers*: China can nominally conscript citizens for the military, but in practice doesn't, *because they have a sufficient stream of volunteers*. These \"volunteer conscripts\" serve for 2 years and can then either (1) leave the military or (2) stay on as newly-minted NCOs.\n\nNote that a majority of the \"volunteer conscripts\" serve with the Ground Forces.

Ukraine has no reason to use HIMARS on large targets well within range of regular artillery, it would be prohibitively expensive and a waste of HIMARS.

I don\u2019t believe Ukraine has used HIMARS like this before, and I honestly don\u2019t see how HIMARS could\u2019ve even done it as they kind of have an alibi blowing up depots and command centers, most of the action occurring at Kherson.\n\nThe Russians say it was HIMARS, but I don\u2019t see why (cost, regular artillery does better job and waste of HIMARS) or if HIMARS could\u2019ve even done it. The evidence so far is pieces of HIMARS rockets that they put on a bench\u2026 which is *real* convincing.

Insane, until one realizes that the way the Russians fight now, they really don't need much better.\n\nReconnaissance Fire Complex, the fancy way of saying everything they possess at the tactical level is designed to find the enemy to destroy by heavy fires, specifically with artillery controlled UAV drones doing ISR in conjunction with automated artillery FDC computers that mean ready cannon and/or rocket artillery can be firing at those targets within seconds of finding a target. They claimed before the war they could do it in seven seconds, and that is what freaked out the US Army, especially since they kinda proved they could do it quickly in 2014-5 Donbas War and Syria. The reality in Ukraine, due to a variety of reasons, is they can't do it that fast,  but RUSI reported drone directed artillery arrives in 3-5 minutes.\n\nThere are two ways a drone can find the enemy. They can either overfly their positions occasionally (in places like the Donbas it's a good chunk of the day) but the best way to find the enemy is overflying enemy positions during a battle. It's nearly impossible not to have to run around a bit, between positions, etc, and they're spotted that way. Most cover and concealment is focused on the ground level, an overhead drone sees them from bird's eye view to spot them. And weapons firing reveal their signature in various ways that get spotted. And if they're spotted by drone operators giving instant 10 digit (1 meter) accurate coordinates, then it comes down to how fast the artillery crew can process an accurate fire mission using a registered gun.\n\nWhen a Russian ground attack launches a deliberate attack they almost surely know beforehand the general area of a UAF company level defensive position. They're nearly always placed near key terrain features or are inside villages/towns/cities. They've often have been subject to numerous ground probes and attacks and lots of drone coverage before the latest ground attack starts.

It just won't be a lot of getting ground, and it's going to take a while.\n\nThey just need to be used purely as reconnaissance elements to advance cautiously to act as bait while overwatched by drones. In that case they might not even need to actually conduct a no shit attack at all, artillery fire is doing all the work and ground troops only expended to \"clean out\" positions that were abandoned or held by very weak UAF defenders. \n\nHow does one counter such tactics? Attack what they require to perform it. \n\nFunny enough, they'll need to be more competent as defenders than attacking.",

It just won&#39;t be a lot of getting ground, and it&#39;s going to take a while.</p>\n\n<p>They just need to be used purely as reconnaissance elements to advance cautiously to act as bait while overwatched by drones. In that case they might not even need to actually conduct a no shit attack at all, artillery fire is doing all the work and ground troops only expended to &quot;clean out&quot; positions that were abandoned or held by very weak UAF defenders. </p>\n\n<p>How does one counter such tactics? Attack what they require to perform it. </p>\n\n<p>Funny enough, they&#39;ll need to be more competent as defenders than attacking.</p>\n</div>",

Manpower was near parity the entire time as I said.\n\n\u201cFrom 1941 until mid-1943, the Red Army confronted 80-90% of Germany's total strength\u201d Glantz When the Titans Clashed\n\nWhat are you talking about.\n\nAs for the casualties: good portion from someone in r/history\n\nSoldiers who were lightly wounded and were treated at their position or in a Verwundetennest (a casualty collection point in American parlance) by a field medic, but did not require treatment at the Truppenverbandplatz (battalion aid station) - would they be reported in any official capacity? My guess is that in the late stages of the war in particular, as the availability of trained medical personnel as well as supplies and casualty transport infrastructure worsened, only more severe injuries would be prioritized for treatment at rear facilities. The Russians with their manpower didn\u2019t have to do with this. In fact 77% of Russian wounded and sick returned to battle. If a casualty never made it to the Truppenverbandplatz, then it would likely be up to his chain of command as to whether he was reported or not; this introduces inconsistencies. \n\nBut indeed the Soviets suffered greater causalities. So here\u2019s this from someone else.\n\nThese two tables https://i.imgur.com/vzzSK4N.png show us the relative combat effectiveness of the Soviet attackers and the Wehrmacht defenders. First and foremost, although the raw-number casualty ratios look very lopsided in favor of the Germans, the casualty ratios as a portion of each side's manpower are actually not very favorable for the Germans at all! In one battle within the larger Dnepr-Carpathians Operation which you cite, despite the fact that the Soviets took more casualties than the Germans in raw numbers, as proportions of the overall force the Soviets take 34% casualties (all types - KIA, WIA, MIA) while the Wehrmacht takes 55% overall casualties.\n\nSoviet sources noted that the 'break-in', the phase of an offensive dedicated to piercing the opponent's defensive lines and creating an opening for the exploitation forces to pass through, consistently produced the highest share of casualties in operations - between 65% and 80% of all casualties in an army-level offensive. This is because the break-in phase exposes the attackers to the defenders' firepower at its most effective: prepared positions with stockpiled ammunition, generally in terrain that does not favor the attacker.\n\n\nThe cited 3:1 advantage for the attackers is a bare minimum for success, but in the late war, ratios of as high as 7:1 were preferred. When the Red Army achieved these large advantages, casualties went down; however, when they were not able to achieve this local superiority, casualties stayed high. For an army that has to really marshal its resources to get divisions up to full strength, you can see how this might be a problem. Indeed, going back to Stoeckli's charts up there, we can see that they take their worst casualty percentages in the sectors of the Carpathian offensive where they are basically 1:1 with the defenders.\n\nCasualties for Bagration are misleading\n\nAt first Glantz glance, the Soviets seem to have it worse at Operation Bagration, but upon closer inspection, the majority of Soviet casualties is injured, and the majority of German casualties are either killed or captured/missing. Now injured personnel can be permanently disabled, but a fair portion will either return to active duty or be re-integrated behind the frontline or in society. Captured soldiers and missing ones the other hand, are pretty much gone. This is the big advantage of a successful offensive and something that the Soviets had been on the receiving end of quite extensively during Barbarossa.\n\n2. Lack of overwhelming force on the Soviet side\n\nAt Dnieper-Carpathian -at an even later time- the disproportionate casualties can be largely attributed to the lack of overwhelming force on the Soviet side.\n\n3. The Soviets were on the offensive, against a (still) tough opponent\n\nThis is arguably the most important reason. At no point in 1944 and 1945 were the Axis forces not strategically on the defensive on the Eastern Front. Ergo the Soviets were continuously on the offensive. Early in the war they were also desperately trying to be on the offensive, as their doctrine dictated they should, but wholly unable to. By 1944 they had gotten immeasurably better at it, but being on the offensive was still a very costly affair in this time period. In more or less equal battles, breakthroughs needed overwhelming force to guarantee operational success and typically incurred far greater average casualties than defensive actions. The only times this was not the case was in spectacularly successful offensives or against much weaker opponents. The Battle for France and Barbarossa and such were in a way just shocking exceptions, that showcased how highly functional the German army was and/or how dysfunctional the Allied/Soviet armies were, rather than prove that the fundamentals of warfare had changed to make the offensive cheaper than defense in terms of lives.\n\nIn this regard, it was fully to be expected that the Soviets, now on the offensive, would pay a heavy price for any successes or reconquest. And we should not underestimate what they were up against at this point either. The common narrative is that the Axis front at this point had been worn out, that the forces were incompetent Italians and demoralized Romanians, and that the German forces had lost vast amounts of trained manpower they absolutely couldn't miss, were increasingly outmatched in quantities of materiel, gradually lost control over the air, and devolved into an outdated doctrine of static defense. And this isn't completely wrong. But it remained a coherent and strong fighting force, up to the last months of the war. The German army, when it was full-strength, had obliterated equal forces.

Manpower was near parity the entire time as I said.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cFrom 1941 until mid-1943, the Red Army confronted 80-90% of Germany&#39;s total strength\u201d Glantz When the Titans Clashed</p>\n\n<p>What are you talking about.</p>\n\n<p>As for the casualties: good portion from someone in <a href=\"/r/history\">r/history</a></p>\n\n<p>Soldiers who were lightly wounded and were treated at their position or in a Verwundetennest (a casualty collection point in American parlance) by a field medic, but did not require treatment at the Truppenverbandplatz (battalion aid station) - would they be reported in any official capacity? My guess is that in the late stages of the war in particular, as the availability of trained medical personnel as well as supplies and casualty transport infrastructure worsened, only more severe injuries would be prioritized for treatment at rear facilities. The Russians with their manpower didn\u2019t have to do with this. In fact 77% of Russian wounded and sick returned to battle. If a casualty never made it to the Truppenverbandplatz, then it would likely be up to his chain of command as to whether he was reported or not; this introduces inconsistencies. </p>\n\n<p>But indeed the Soviets suffered greater causalities. So here\u2019s this from someone else.</p>\n\n<p>These two tables <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/vzzSK4N.png\">https://i.imgur.com/vzzSK4N.png</a> show us the relative combat effectiveness of the Soviet attackers and the Wehrmacht defenders. First and foremost, although the raw-number casualty ratios look very lopsided in favor of the Germans, the casualty ratios as a portion of each side&#39;s manpower are actually not very favorable for the Germans at all! In one battle within the larger Dnepr-Carpathians Operation which you cite, despite the fact that the Soviets took more casualties than the Germans in raw numbers, as proportions of the overall force the Soviets take 34% casualties (all types - KIA, WIA, MIA) while the Wehrmacht takes 55% overall casualties.</p>\n\n<p>Soviet sources noted that the &#39;break-in&#39;, the phase of an offensive dedicated to piercing the opponent&#39;s defensive lines and creating an opening for the exploitation forces to pass through, consistently produced the highest share of casualties in operations - between 65% and 80% of all casualties in an army-level offensive. This is because the break-in phase exposes the attackers to the defenders&#39; firepower at its most effective: prepared positions with stockpiled ammunition, generally in terrain that does not favor the attacker.</p>\n\n<p>The cited 3:1 advantage for the attackers is a bare minimum for success, but in the late war, ratios of as high as 7:1 were preferred. When the Red Army achieved these large advantages, casualties went down; however, when they were not able to achieve this local superiority, casualties stayed high. For an army that has to really marshal its resources to get divisions up to full strength, you can see how this might be a problem. Indeed, going back to Stoeckli&#39;s charts up there, we can see that they take their worst casualty percentages in the sectors of the Carpathian offensive where they are basically 1:1 with the defenders.</p>\n\n<p>Casualties for Bagration are misleading</p>\n\n<p>At first Glantz glance, the Soviets seem to have it worse at Operation Bagration, but upon closer inspection, the majority of Soviet casualties is injured, and the majority of German casualties are either killed or captured/missing. Now injured personnel can be permanently disabled, but a fair portion will either return to active duty or be re-integrated behind the frontline or in society. Captured soldiers and missing ones the other hand, are pretty much gone. This is the big advantage of a successful offensive and something that the Soviets had been on the receiving end of quite extensively during Barbarossa.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Lack of overwhelming force on the Soviet side</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>At Dnieper-Carpathian -at an even later time- the disproportionate casualties can be largely attributed to the lack of overwhelming force on the Soviet side.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The Soviets were on the offensive, against a (still) tough opponent</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This is arguably the most important reason. At no point in 1944 and 1945 were the Axis forces not strategically on the defensive on the Eastern Front. Ergo the Soviets were continuously on the offensive. Early in the war they were also desperately trying to be on the offensive, as their doctrine dictated they should, but wholly unable to. By 1944 they had gotten immeasurably better at it, but being on the offensive was still a very costly affair in this time period. In more or less equal battles, breakthroughs needed overwhelming force to guarantee operational success and typically incurred far greater average casualties than defensive actions. The only times this was not the case was in spectacularly successful offensives or against much weaker opponents. The Battle for France and Barbarossa and such were in a way just shocking exceptions, that showcased how highly functional the German army was and/or how dysfunctional the Allied/Soviet armies were, rather than prove that the fundamentals of warfare had changed to make the offensive cheaper than defense in terms of lives.</p>\n\n<p>In this regard, it was fully to be expected that the Soviets, now on the offensive, would pay a heavy price for any successes or reconquest. And we should not underestimate what they were up against at this point either. The common narrative is that the Axis front at this point had been worn out, that the forces were incompetent Italians and demoralized Romanians, and that the German forces had lost vast amounts of trained manpower they absolutely couldn&#39;t miss, were increasingly outmatched in quantities of materiel, gradually lost control over the air, and devolved into an outdated doctrine of static defense. And this isn&#39;t completely wrong. But it remained a coherent and strong fighting force, up to the last months of the war. The German army, when it was full-strength, had obliterated equal forces. Being no longer full-strength it still proved a force to be reckoned with.</p>\n</div>",

Blitzkrieg is not like this which is one of the reasons why Germany has been defeated in the end because the German army lacks an actual doctrine and even if they do, they rarely consider long term strategy in their minds. The Red Army is far more holistic and a better vision to conduct a war than the Wehrmacht ever did; so much so that what is even more impressive is that deception has also been fully incorporated into the Red Army doctrine to extreme success.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s also worth noting that while they lost a lot of land and men in Barbarossa, they decimated the German army as well. Tank units had half their allocated numbers, veteran units destroyed, and the German logistics stretched beyond breaking. They very nearly destroyed army group center during the counter attack that winter.</p>\n</div>",

The problem for Russia is that the countries that will likely try to get Ukraine to jump on the cease fire are not the ones actually supplying Ukraine.

I think it will take time for that tactic to work, time during which Russia will be weakened and Ukraine emboldened by the cease fire demand.\n\nSo instead, I think Russia is using energy, food, etc to try to reduce western support. Only once western support is reduced will they make the demand. I think they will want a reasonable probability of immediate results before they suggest a cease fire.",

For most posters, I would imagine this is the first time they have actively had to reckon with the idea that a nuclear war is not just a product of fiction or distant probability or a deus ex machina wargame resolution but a real, legitimate threat. They did not live through decades of the world existing on the edge of nuclear brinkmanship. Nuclear weapons were the purview of crazy dictators and wars of large-scale slaughter were things in history books. The sudden realization of an existential threat that means the death of our entire civilization in a matter of hours can be quite hard to reconcile and people will discuss it extensively to try and place some framework on the fear. With that in mind, there's a lot more discussion of nuclear war in the discourse in general right now, because nuclear war (and fear thereof) sells papers/articles/gets clicks etc. Anybody with relatively decent credentials stands a fair chance of getting a nuclear take out there and published at the moment, far more so than I think at any time in the last 30ish years. That's a lot of chatter in the air about a scary thing and it's relatively self-perpetuating.

The reason i ask is because I find both current narratives implausible:\n1) Ukraine struck the prison of its own accord to discourage surrendering. This one is fucking off the charts insane. Zelensky gave the order for the Azovstal defenders to surrender even when many were still determined to keep fighting. Now they\u2019re being punished for following his own orders??? \n2) Russia blew up the building to hide POW abuse. This seems more plausible at first\u2026but really, when one thinks about it-Russia is going to blow up a building full of POWs to draw attention away from abuse of those POWs? I know we all want to believe (and thee is admittedly plenty of evidence for) Russian general command being brutal and incompetent, but the sheer stupidity of authorizing such an operation is unfathomable. \n\nNow I know of no evidence to suggest the Russia baiting Ukraine scenario but it seems possible for some reasons:\n1) Many in the DPR LPR would want nothing more than to publicly execute hundreds of Azov members for their supposed crimes. Russia cannot do this flat out for public image reasons. Those who want rivers of Azov blood to flow ASAP are mollified by this event.\n2) Russia successfully gets an opportunity to make Ukraine look bad. They thus are able a) to regenerate their own image as the saviors of Ukraine from its seemingly brutal self governance, which rejuvenates the raison e\u2019etre for their war. b) If the UN mission visits and finds evidence it was a Ukrainian strike, that will have a chip to play in the international stage, evidence that \u2018we are not the (only) bad guys\u2019 thus weakening international support.\n3) This would be much less of a hassle, it seems logistically easier to just get Ukraine to be baited to conduct a strike and than to say it was a strike and show it off as such then blow it up onself and have to make a \u2018fake set\u2019 for UN investigators, who are not idiots, to discover fake evidence.\n\nSo in the end, we get Russian duplicity, as expected, but to me with a more credible combination of motivation and means to conduct this operation. But for sure, I am not saying this is what happened. I really have no proof or am trying to offer any, just mulling a thought.",

This seems more plausible at first\u2026but really, when one thinks about it-Russia is going to blow up a building full of POWs to draw attention away from abuse of those POWs? I know we all want to believe (and thee is admittedly plenty of evidence for) Russian general command being brutal and incompetent, but the sheer stupidity of authorizing such an operation is unfathomable. </p>\n\n<p>Now I know of no evidence to suggest the Russia baiting Ukraine scenario but it seems possible for some reasons:\n1) Many in the DPR LPR would want nothing more than to publicly execute hundreds of Azov members for their supposed crimes. Russia cannot do this flat out for public image reasons. Those who want rivers of Azov blood to flow ASAP are mollified by this event.\n2) Russia successfully gets an opportunity to make Ukraine look bad. They thus are able a) to regenerate their own image as the saviors of Ukraine from its seemingly brutal self governance, which rejuvenates the raison e\u2019etre for their war. b) If the UN mission visits and finds evidence it was a Ukrainian strike, that will have a chip to play in the international stage, evidence that \u2018we are not the (only) bad guys\u2019 thus weakening international support.\n3) This would be much less of a hassle, it seems logistically easier to just get Ukraine to be baited to conduct a strike and than to say it was a strike and show it off as such then blow it up onself and have to make a \u2018fake set\u2019 for UN investigators, who are not idiots, to discover fake evidence.</p>\n\n<p>So in the end, we get Russian duplicity, as expected, but to me with a more credible combination of motivation and means to conduct this operation. But for sure, I am not saying this is what happened. I really have no proof or am trying to offer any, just mulling a thought.</p>\n</div>",
