      "selftext": "The r/CredibleDefense daily megathread is for asking questions and posting submissions that would not fit the criteria of our post submissions. As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster. Don't abuse it though! If something is not obviously against the rules but you still feel that it should be reviewed, leave a short but descriptive comment while filing the report.",

In this case, Europe could not rely on US American reinforcement for rolling back Russia's air defenses, so we need to prepare for this situation.\n\nI think it's a good short piece, so I would suggest reading the whole thing, but here are some interesting quotes:\n\n\"If Ukraine is forced to negotiate a ceasefire, Russia would be in a strong position to demand retreats from key positions and the removal of Kyiv\u2019s remaining military initiative as baseline concessions. Such a process would also fracture Western political unity \u2013 which has largely held up to this point \u2013 and break all trust between Ukraine and its Western partners, since it could only be forced by withholding desperately needed support. Russia would then most likely spend three to six months reorganising its currently weak logistics, training and force dispositions, and then restart offensive operations from a much stronger position.\"\n\n\"Russia is set on a course that will see its production of weapons, ammunition and new formations increase significantly over the coming 2\u20133 years. Depending on how successfully Western governments sustain the supplies that Ukraine needs to keep fighting effectively, this will either make future Ukrainian advances harder to achieve or potentially result in serious reverses to gains made so far. Either way, without major increases in European defence production and a focus on reorganising and training militaries to credibly roll back any future Russian aggression against Alliance territory, Russia will regenerate a capacity to directly threaten NATO faster than most political or even military planners appear to realise.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, the Chinese military is growing faster and increasing its capabilities more quickly than most thought possible even five years ago. Developments in very long-range anti-ship and anti-tanker/AWACS aircraft missile systems are particularly problematic for key US military capabilities across the vast distances of the Indo-Pacific. Furthermore, many of the US technical answers to some of these problems \u2013 such as the Next Generation Air Dominance fighter, Collaborative Combat Aircraft and the new B-21 Raider bomber \u2013 will not be available until 2029 or 2030 at a useful scale. The upshot is that the maximum period of risk of the Chinese military attempting to blockade or invade Taiwan or key disputed territories in the South or East China Seas is likely to be 2026\u20132028. Very problematic Chinese capabilities will be largely mature and fielded, but many of the US answers will not be ready yet. In the event of a dangerous standoff or an actual military conflict in the Indo-Pacific during this period, therefore, the US will be heavily stretched to meet its own commitments and Allied needs in that theatre.

At&#39;s a fair bit more than 100%...</p>\n\n<p>All while surveys found that &gt;70% of Crimeans considered Ukraine their motherland back in 2011.

        "body": "[**Ukrainian Marines on \u2018Suicide Mission\u2019 in Crossing the Dnipro River** *Soldiers frustrated by positive reports from Ukrainian officials break their silence, describing the effort as brutalizing and, ultimately, futile.*  \n](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/16/world/europe/ukraine-kherson-river-russia.html)  \n\n> There was a faint tremor in the marine\u2019s voice as he recounted the murderous fighting on the east bank of the Dnipro River, where he was wounded recently.\n> \n> \u201cWe were sitting in the water at night and we were shelled by everything,\u201d the marine, Maksym, said. \u201cMy comrades were dying in front of my eyes.\u201d\n> \n> For two months, Ukraine\u2019s Marine Corps has been spearheading an assault across the Dnipro River in the southern region of Kherson to recapture territory from Russian troops. The operation is Ukraine\u2019s latest attempt in its flagging counteroffensive to breach Russian defenses in the south and turn the tide of the war.\n> \n> Soldiers and marines who have taken part in the river crossings described the offensive as brutalizing and futile, as waves of Ukrainian troops have been struck down on the river banks or in the water, even before they reach the other side.\n> \n> Conditions are so difficult, a half-dozen men involved in the fighting said in interviews, that in most places, there is nowhere to dig in. The first approaches tend to be marshy islands threaded with rivulets or meadows that have become a quagmire of mud and bomb craters filled with water.\n> \n> The soldiers and marines gave only their first names or asked for anonymity for security reasons, and commanders declined almost all media requests to visit military units in the Kherson region.  \n> \n> Several soldiers and marines spoke to journalists out of concern about the high casualties and what they said were overly optimistic accounts from officials about the progress of the offensive.\n> \n> The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said that it was not immediately possible to comment on the soldiers\u2019 accusations but that it would provide a response in due course.\n> \n> Some of the heaviest fighting has been in the village of Krynky, on the east bank 20 miles upriver from Kherson city, where Ukrainian troops seized a narrow strip of fishermen\u2019s houses \u2014 the only place where they managed to establish a toehold.  \n>   \n> But footage of the area, livestreamed from a drone and seen by The New York Times, verified soldiers\u2019 accounts of heavy Russian airstrikes that have destroyed the houses and turned the river bank into a mass of mud and splintered trees.  \n> \n> Fresh troops arriving on the east bank have to step on soldiers\u2019 bodies that lie tangled in the churned mud, said Oleksiy, an experienced soldier who fought in Krynky in October and has since crossed multiple times to help evacuate the wounded.\n> \n> Some of the dead marines have been lying there for as long as two months, as units have been unable to retrieve the bodies because of the intense shelling, said Volodymyr, a deputy company commander who was attending the funeral of one of his men, identified only as Denys, last week.\n> \n> \u201cThe left bank is very difficult,\u201d Volodymyr said. \u201cThose who do it are the real heroes, men with great will power.\u201d  \n> \n> With Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive bogged down and the United States and even the European Union showing signs of cutting back aid, the cross-river offensive has been keenly watched for signs that Ukraine can regain momentum against Russian forces. The hope is that they can create a breakthrough deep enough to threaten Russia\u2019s supply routes and its hold in the south. The Marine Corps, rebuilt to full strength this year with several newly formed brigades, was assigned the task.\n> \n> Since the war\u2019s outset, Ukrainian officials have sought to maintain a positive narrative in an effort to maintain morale at home and support abroad. Casualty numbers are not published, nor are details of setbacks suffered by Ukrainian troops.\n> \n> In the case of the Dnipro, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine and other officials have suggested recently that the marines have gained a foothold on the eastern bank. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs posted a statement last month claiming they had established several strongholds.\n> \n> But marines and soldiers who have been there say these accounts overstate the case.\n> \n> \u201cThere are no positions. There is no such thing as an observation post or position,\u201d said Oleksiy. \u201cIt is impossible to gain a foothold there. It\u2019s impossible to move equipment there.\u201d\n> \n> \u201cIt\u2019s not even a fight for survival,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s a suicide mission.\u201d  \n> \n> Oleksiy said the Ukrainian commanders\u2019 poor preparation and logistics had decimated his battalion. Wounded men were being left behind because of a lack of boats, he said, and the brutal conditions were degrading morale and soldiers\u2019 support for each other.\n> \n> \u201cPeople who end up there are not prepared psychologically,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t even understand where they are going. They are not told by the command that sends them there.\u201d\n> \n> Oleksiy agreed to let The Times publish his account out of frustration at the losses. \u201cI did not see anything like this in Bakhmut or Soledar,\u201d he said, referring to two of the most intense battles on the eastern front. \u201cIt\u2019s so wasteful.\u201d\n> \n> Russian airstrikes along the river banks marked on the Ukraine Control Map, which geolocates video footage of strikes on both sides of the front, confirm his description. The map shows heavy Russian aerial bombardment of several crossing points along a 40-mile stretch of the river.\n> \n> Russian troops are taking heavy losses, too, by several accounts. The map details multiple hits by Ukrainian artillery, rockets and drones on Russian troops and armor in all of the main settlements along the eastern bank. The city of Kherson has come under repeated Russian attack, but it also resounds with the constant firing of Ukrainian artillery.\n> \n> \u201cGenerally, we are on hunting duty,\u201d said Yevhen Karas, 36, deputy commander of the 14th Separate Regiment, who was visiting one of his units operating drones against Russian targets across the river. He asked for the location not be revealed for security reasons. \n> \n> \u201cThe main priority is Russian artillery and to defend our operations,\u201d said Karas, whose surname is also his military call sign. After two months of operations, he said, the Russian units in the area and long-range artillery had been heavily suppressed. Russian troops were generally staying under cover during the day and moved only at night as a result, he said.\n> \n> Karas headed a volunteer military group, C14, from 2014, which has been described as extreme right-wing by watchdog groups. In 2016 it was integrated as a special operations force in the Ukrainian army.\n> \n> The marines were suffering, Karas said, but the Ukrainian attacks had unnerved Russian commanders, who brought back an airborne unit from the Zaporizhzhia front to bolster the defense.\n> \n> \u201cThey are very scared that Ukraine this month, or in the spring or the summer, will increase its territory to expand and liberate\u201d the east bank, he said, adding that he followed radio intercepts of Russian communications, among other sources of intelligence.\n> \n> Even small territorial gains would give Ukraine the ability to strike Russia\u2019s supply routes into Crimea, he said.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/16/world/europe/ukraine-kherson-river-russia.html\"><strong>Ukrainian Marines on \u2018Suicide Mission\u2019 in Crossing the Dnipro River</strong> <em>Soldiers frustrated by positive reports from Ukrainian officials break their silence, describing the effort as brutalizing and, ultimately, futile.</em><br/>\n</a>  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>There was a faint tremor in the marine\u2019s voice as he recounted the murderous fighting on the east bank of the Dnipro River, where he was wounded recently.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe were sitting in the water at night and we were shelled by everything,\u201d the marine, Maksym, said. \u201cMy comrades were dying in front of my eyes.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>For two months, Ukraine\u2019s Marine Corps has been spearheading an assault across the Dnipro River in the southern region of Kherson to recapture territory from Russian troops. The operation is Ukraine\u2019s latest attempt in its flagging counteroffensive to breach Russian defenses in the south and turn the tide of the war.</p>\n\n<p>Soldiers and marines who have taken part in the river crossings described the offensive as brutalizing and futile, as waves of Ukrainian troops have been struck down on the river banks or in the water, even before they reach the other side.</p>\n\n<p>Conditions are so difficult, a half-dozen men involved in the fighting said in interviews, that in most places, there is nowhere to dig in. The first approaches tend to be marshy islands threaded with rivulets or meadows that have become a quagmire of mud and bomb craters filled with water.</p>\n\n<p>The soldiers and marines gave only their first names or asked for anonymity for security reasons, and commanders declined almost all media requests to visit military units in the Kherson region.  </p>\n\n<p>Several soldiers and marines spoke to journalists out of concern about the high casualties and what they said were overly optimistic accounts from officials about the progress of the offensive.</p>\n\n<p>The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said that it was not immediately possible to comment on the soldiers\u2019 accusations but that it would provide a response in due course.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the heaviest fighting has been in the village of Krynky, on the east bank 20 miles upriver from Kherson city, where Ukrainian troops seized a narrow strip of fishermen\u2019s houses \u2014 the only place where they managed to establish a toehold.  </p>\n\n<p>But footage of the area, livestreamed from a drone and seen by The New York Times, verified soldiers\u2019 accounts of heavy Russian airstrikes that have destroyed the houses and turned the river bank into a mass of mud and splintered trees.  </p>\n\n<p>Fresh troops arriving on the east bank have to step on soldiers\u2019 bodies that lie tangled in the churned mud, said Oleksiy, an experienced soldier who fought in Krynky in October and has since crossed multiple times to help evacuate the wounded.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the dead marines have been lying there for as long as two months, as units have been unable to retrieve the bodies because of the intense shelling, said Volodymyr, a deputy company commander who was attending the funeral of one of his men, identified only as Denys, last week.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe left bank is very difficult,\u201d Volodymyr said. \u201cThose who do it are the real heroes, men with great will power.\u201d  </p>\n\n<p>With Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive bogged down and the United States and even the European Union showing signs of cutting back aid, the cross-river offensive has been keenly watched for signs that Ukraine can regain momentum against Russian forces. The hope is that they can create a breakthrough deep enough to threaten Russia\u2019s supply routes and its hold in the south. The Marine Corps, rebuilt to full strength this year with several newly formed brigades, was assigned the task.</p>\n\n<p>Since the war\u2019s outset, Ukrainian officials have sought to maintain a positive narrative in an effort to maintain morale at home and support abroad. Casualty numbers are not published, nor are details of setbacks suffered by Ukrainian troops.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of the Dnipro, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine and other officials have suggested recently that the marines have gained a foothold on the eastern bank. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs posted a statement last month claiming they had established several strongholds.</p>\n\n<p>But marines and soldiers who have been there say these accounts overstate the case.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThere are no positions. There is no such thing as an observation post or position,\u201d said Oleksiy. \u201cIt is impossible to gain a foothold there. It\u2019s impossible to move equipment there.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not even a fight for survival,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s a suicide mission.\u201d  </p>\n\n<p>Oleksiy said the Ukrainian commanders\u2019 poor preparation and logistics had decimated his battalion. Wounded men were being left behind because of a lack of boats, he said, and the brutal conditions were degrading morale and soldiers\u2019 support for each other.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cPeople who end up there are not prepared psychologically,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t even understand where they are going. They are not told by the command that sends them there.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Oleksiy agreed to let The Times publish his account out of frustration at the losses. \u201cI did not see anything like this in Bakhmut or Soledar,\u201d he said, referring to two of the most intense battles on the eastern front. \u201cIt\u2019s so wasteful.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Russian airstrikes along the river banks marked on the Ukraine Control Map, which geolocates video footage of strikes on both sides of the front, confirm his description. The map shows heavy Russian aerial bombardment of several crossing points along a 40-mile stretch of the river.</p>\n\n<p>Russian troops are taking heavy losses, too, by several accounts. The map details multiple hits by Ukrainian artillery, rockets and drones on Russian troops and armor in all of the main settlements along the eastern bank. The city of Kherson has come under repeated Russian attack, but it also resounds with the constant firing of Ukrainian artillery.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cGenerally, we are on hunting duty,\u201d said Yevhen Karas, 36, deputy commander of the 14th Separate Regiment, who was visiting one of his units operating drones against Russian targets across the river. He asked for the location not be revealed for security reasons. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe main priority is Russian artillery and to defend our operations,\u201d said Karas, whose surname is also his military call sign. After two months of operations, he said, the Russian units in the area and long-range artillery had been heavily suppressed. Russian troops were generally staying under cover during the day and moved only at night as a result, he said.</p>\n\n<p>Karas headed a volunteer military group, C14, from 2014, which has been described as extreme right-wing by watchdog groups. In 2016 it was integrated as a special operations force in the Ukrainian army.</p>\n\n<p>The marines were suffering, Karas said, but the Ukrainian attacks had unnerved Russian commanders, who brought back an airborne unit from the Zaporizhzhia front to bolster the defense.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThey are very scared that Ukraine this month, or in the spring or the summer, will increase its territory to expand and liberate\u201d the east bank, he said, adding that he followed radio intercepts of Russian communications, among other sources of intelligence.</p>\n\n<p>Even small territorial gains would give Ukraine the ability to strike Russia\u2019s supply routes into Crimea, he said. But for now, the cross-river operation was focused not on a breakthrough but on drawing in and killing as many Russian troops as possible, he said.</p>\n\n<p>Drones were proving critical in that fight, providing reconnaissance and guiding artillery, while increasingly targeting troops and equipment with explosives. A kamikaze drone was cheaper and more accurate than expensive artillery shells, which are in increasingly short supply, said the unit commander, Dzhmil, 37, giving his call sign.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe read the papers and we know who is helping us and that everything has its price,\u201d he said, referring to growing debates in the United States and Europe over aid to Ukraine.

This means Russians with their huge advantage of artillery et al means they are basically out of range on certain sectors to hit Ukrainian positions and infrastructure on the other side of the river.

If the US and other countries were willing to bomb Houthi missile launchers, then this wouldn\u2019t be a problem, but (in my opinion, correctly) they have decided that this would be too much of an escalation and therefore not a good idea.
