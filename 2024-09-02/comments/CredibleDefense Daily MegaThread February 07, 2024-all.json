Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

They have to be allowed to hold their nose. Importantly, Dems in left wing states or with strong progressive credentials (Bernie) need to be allowed to vote no and still pass. Second, in recent American politics you almost *never* see substantial crossing of party lines like that. Its extremely extremely rare, and doubly so in a presidential election cycle. Both parties are too disciplined, the threat of a primary is for many politicians the most serious threat they will face in their careers (this also feeds into point 1, where primary voters are more extreme to either wing than gen election voters). So being the 'guy or gal who gave Biden a big W' is unpalatable. Its personally risky, but it also breaks ranks with the party establishment who have become *extremely* powerful since 2016. Basically the McCain types have all but gone extinct. Only the Dem party has major rank-breakers, Sinema and Manchin. And theyre on the outs, Manchin will not run for reelection this cycle and Sinema is doing extremely badly in AZ. Likely to get a third place finish, if she doesn't pull out. So there is just no incentive for a either group to punch this bill through, unless nearly the whole body does so. \n\nPut another way, this bill was only ever going to pass 70-30 just for optics and posturing sense. 60-40 is not just not realistic.",

        "body": "New update on the tactical situation of the front in Ukraine. Today I will comment on all sectors except Avdiivka, which for spacing reasons I will post in the tomorrow's megathread. Hoping not to have to modify anything in the meantime. As usual, my main source are the Ukrainian military observators Mashovets and Kovalenko, several Ukrainian and Russian Telegram channels (e.g. WarArchive for geolocations) and of course DeepState. I suggest having a map under eye while reading, for instance DeepState or Andrew Perpetua's. \n\nKupyansk sector. The Russians from the 6th Army of the Western Military District recorded progress for about 4/500 meters in the forest south of Lyman Pershyi, capturing some Ukrainian positions. This has somewhat complicated things for Synkivka. Right now the houses at the northern end of the village are gray area, to my understanding. But in any case, the situation is stable and the Ukrainians are firmly maintaining control of the village. \n\nFrom here to Kyslivka there is no progress to report. Problems arose in the area of Tabaivka and Krokhmalne, when around mid-January the 47th Tank Division (1st Tank Army, WMD) broke through Ukrainian positions along the Kupyansk-Svatove railway, held by the 103rd TDF Brigade. On the second day since the breakthrough, the village of Krokhmalne was taken, after which the Russians headed towards the Pischana River and Tabaivka. In the latter direction, the Russians have advanced more than 4 kms in the last three weeks. At the moment they should have reached the course of the river inside this village. The Russians have thus succeeded in sweeping into the Pischana valley. In itself, the situation is not extremely serious, as the valley is surrounded by heights (which are the watershed between the Pischana and the Oskil) both to the north and to the west.\n\nNow the Russians are concentrating on advancing along the P07 Road in the direction of Stepova Novoselivka. Here the plan is to conquer the heights north of Tabaivka (where the Pischana River, a small tributary of the Oskil, has its source) and outflank the solid Ukrainian positions around Kotlyarivka and Kyslivka. There has been some little progress, but these heights as well have Ukrainian trenches and fortifications. For this purpose, the 1st Tank Regiment and the 15th Motorized Regiment of the 2nd Motorized Division (1st Tank Army) have arrived in the area. This division has been reinforced by about 5k men during the last month, according to Mashovets, largely flowing in from the 346th Regiment of the Mobilization Reserve.\n\nIn the Telegram channel \"Poisk_in_UA\" I\u2019ve read that the mother of a soldier in the 1st Tank Regiment who signed a contract in October 2023 and was declared missing a month later, stated that since October there are 350 MIAs in this unit. This seems an unreasonably high number as I am not aware that this unit has been overwhelmingly involved compared to others, but I\u2019m reporting that anyway. \n\nThe 12th Tank Regiment of the 4th Tank Division (1st Tank Army) attempted to attack towards Ivanivka from the east, as part of this plan, but without success.\n\nWhen it comes to Ukrainian reinforcements, the Russians (specifically, Multi_XAM, a fairly credible channel for these things, I think he has contacts with their military intelligence) report elements of the 44th Mech Brigade and of the 4th Tank Brigade being deployed to contain the breakthrough in this area, which could be plausible, since they are formations already largely deployed between Kupyansk and Svatove anyway.\n\nJust to the south the Russians are trying to move towards Berestove. In the second half of January they had managed to advance about 1,5 km towards this village from Krokhmalne. However, it seems that their successes have been stopped - the area is defended by the 25th Airborne Brigade.\n\nSvatove sector. There was some reconnaissance in force by the Russians in the Serhiivka/Novojehorivka area (which on the Russian side should be covered by the 380th Regiment of the Territorial Forces) towards the Ukrainian positions, all of which were repulsed by the 68th Jager Brigade, i.e. the brigade that contributed the most to stopping the Russian summer offensive in this area and has covered this section of the front ever since.\n\nKreminna sector. In the direction of Makiivka, the Russians are not far from the outskirts of the village after the advances in the first half of January. The 752nd Motorized Regiment of the 3rd Motorized Division (20th Army, WMD) recently received two fresh companies as reinforcements. \n\nFurther south, the offensive of the 144th Motorized Division (20th Army) continues, despite considerable losses; in the direction of Terny, the Russians have advanced 5,5 kms since early December, including between 2 and 2,5 kms recorded since the last days of January. The Russians have taken half of the forested ravine (named \"Alligator\" by the Russians), a ravine that lies between two heights descending to the Zherebets River. They are now not even 2 kms from the first houses in Terny. Their goal is, firstly, to cut the road just south of the reservoir to the west of Terny, one of the main roads used to supply Ukrainian units in the eastern bank of this (small) river. \n\nThe Ukrainians have reinforced their grouping in the area: there are the 21st Mech Brigade, the 97th Mech Battalion of the 60th Mech Brigade, the 3rd Battalion of the 25th Airborne Brigade and the 18th \"Sloviansk\" Brigade of the National Guard, including its \"Donbas\" Battalion. In the Yampolivka area, towards which there have been Russian advances, albeit of lesser magnitude, the defense is held by the 63rd Mech Brigade, supported by elements of the 4th Tank Brigade and one battalion each from the 117th and 126th TDF Brigades, while the 164th Motorized Brigade of the 25th Army of the CMD is attacking.  \n\nIn the Serebrianka Forest the intensity of fighting remains very high, but there is no concrete Russian progress. The 100th TDF Brigade has stopped attacks from the 169th Motorized Brigade of the 25th Army (which were supported by tanks too) near Dibrova, while the \"Azov\" Brigade of the Offensive Guard has halted those in the eastern part of the forest. In particular, since the deployment of the latter brigade last August in the Serebrianka Forest, Russian progress has come to a virtual standstill, after constant counterattacks had begun in late January 2023, when month after month the Russians retook the eastern part of the forest, driving the Ukrainians away from Kreminna. \n\nSiversk sector. Over the past month the intensity of the fighting has increased greatly. The 127th Motorized Brigade and the 6th Motorized Regiment of the 2nd Corps (8th Army, SMD) are pressing against Bilohorivka (defended by the 81st Airmobile Brigade) from both the north and the east. The status of the filtration station along the Siversky Donets River, attacked by Storm-Z/V units, is unknown at the moment - it\u2019s considered a gray area. The Russians already control the heights to the north-east of the village. DeepState wrote about a major Russian mechanized attack repulsed in recent days, with little success on their part, although the Ukrainians are harmed, here as elsewhere, by shortages of artillery and mortar shells, which FPV drones cannot replace. It\u2019s possible that the Russians have advanced a few hundred meters from the chalk processing plant (already controlled by them) in the direction of the settlement and of the chalk quarry, capturing several industrial buildings.\n\nIn the other sections of this sector the situation has seemingly stabilized. After the Ukrainians withdrew from Vesele there was no more Russian progress in that direction. In fact, the village is likely gray area today, or at least much of it. The 51st Air Assault Regiment of the 106th VDV Division, which had entered the village, recently posted a video of their men in a village passing it off as Vesele - but it was geolocated as being in Yakovlivka, not far away but in Russian hands for over a year. \n\nBakhmut sector. The Ukrainians appear to have effectively halted the offensive that began in November. The 200th Motorized Brigade of the 14th Corps of the Arctic Fleet and the \"Sever-V\" Assault and Reconnaissance Brigade were stopped in their advance inside the village of Bohdanivka and in the heights north-west of the settlement. Indeed, inside Bohdanivka the Ukrainians counterattacked and regained some ground, driving the Russians away from the center of the village. The Ukrainian 56th Motorized Brigade, 77th Airmobile Brigade and 17th Tank Brigade are active in the area, as well as elements of the TDF. A battalion of the 24th Mech Brigade and the 3rd Mech Battalion of the 93rd Mech Brigade have arrived too, together with, likely, a battalion of the 141st Infantry Brigade. Beside this, the layout of forces here and in the southern flank is pretty much the same as I had listed the last time.\n\nThe push by the 98th VDV Division has been halted too, it looks like. The Russians have so far been unable to overcome the Ukrainian trench system located on both sides of the Bakhmut - Chasiv Yar railway between Bohdanivka and Khromove, as well as to get beyond the graveyard of the latter village.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>New update on the tactical situation of the front in Ukraine. Today I will comment on all sectors except Avdiivka, which for spacing reasons I will post in the tomorrow&#39;s megathread. Hoping not to have to modify anything in the meantime. As usual, my main source are the Ukrainian military observators Mashovets and Kovalenko, several Ukrainian and Russian Telegram channels (e.g. WarArchive for geolocations) and of course DeepState. I suggest having a map under eye while reading, for instance DeepState or Andrew Perpetua&#39;s. </p>\n\n<p>Kupyansk sector. The Russians from the 6th Army of the Western Military District recorded progress for about 4/500 meters in the forest south of Lyman Pershyi, capturing some Ukrainian positions. This has somewhat complicated things for Synkivka. Right now the houses at the northern end of the village are gray area, to my understanding. But in any case, the situation is stable and the Ukrainians are firmly maintaining control of the village. </p>\n\n<p>From here to Kyslivka there is no progress to report. Problems arose in the area of Tabaivka and Krokhmalne, when around mid-January the 47th Tank Division (1st Tank Army, WMD) broke through Ukrainian positions along the Kupyansk-Svatove railway, held by the 103rd TDF Brigade. On the second day since the breakthrough, the village of Krokhmalne was taken, after which the Russians headed towards the Pischana River and Tabaivka. In the latter direction, the Russians have advanced more than 4 kms in the last three weeks. At the moment they should have reached the course of the river inside this village. The Russians have thus succeeded in sweeping into the Pischana valley. In itself, the situation is not extremely serious, as the valley is surrounded by heights (which are the watershed between the Pischana and the Oskil) both to the north and to the west.</p>\n\n<p>Now the Russians are concentrating on advancing along the P07 Road in the direction of Stepova Novoselivka. Here the plan is to conquer the heights north of Tabaivka (where the Pischana River, a small tributary of the Oskil, has its source) and outflank the solid Ukrainian positions around Kotlyarivka and Kyslivka. There has been some little progress, but these heights as well have Ukrainian trenches and fortifications. For this purpose, the 1st Tank Regiment and the 15th Motorized Regiment of the 2nd Motorized Division (1st Tank Army) have arrived in the area. This division has been reinforced by about 5k men during the last month, according to Mashovets, largely flowing in from the 346th Regiment of the Mobilization Reserve.</p>\n\n<p>In the Telegram channel &quot;Poisk_in_UA&quot; I\u2019ve read that the mother of a soldier in the 1st Tank Regiment who signed a contract in October 2023 and was declared missing a month later, stated that since October there are 350 MIAs in this unit. This seems an unreasonably high number as I am not aware that this unit has been overwhelmingly involved compared to others, but I\u2019m reporting that anyway. </p>\n\n<p>The 12th Tank Regiment of the 4th Tank Division (1st Tank Army) attempted to attack towards Ivanivka from the east, as part of this plan, but without success.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to Ukrainian reinforcements, the Russians (specifically, Multi_XAM, a fairly credible channel for these things, I think he has contacts with their military intelligence) report elements of the 44th Mech Brigade and of the 4th Tank Brigade being deployed to contain the breakthrough in this area, which could be plausible, since they are formations already largely deployed between Kupyansk and Svatove anyway.</p>\n\n<p>Just to the south the Russians are trying to move towards Berestove.

            "body": "On the southern flank, from the area of the dachas to the west of Bakhmut there was an advance of a handful of hundred meters towards Ivanivske, with the Russians (I think the 102nd Motorized Regiment of the 150th Motorized Division of the 8th Army of the SMD) getting quite close to the first houses of Ivanivske. \n\nIn the Klishchiivka area the Russians made no progress and indeed Hill 215, a tactically important height located to the north-west of the village, was confirmed to still be in Ukrainian hands, with the Russians unable to capture the entire system of fortifications in that area despite very fierce fighting in the area. They did, however, advance a few hundred meters along a ravine 1,5 km north of these heights, aiming to flank the Ukrainian positions from there. \n\nAlong the Bakhmut-Horlivka railway there is no Russian progress - indeed, the Ukrainians still hold positions near the ponds east of the railroad, between Klishchiivka and Andriivka. The Ukrainians have formed a new brigade of the Offensive Guard: \"Pomsta\u201d, raised by reforming the Luhansk Border Guards detachment. It has already been deployed between Andriivka and Kurdyumivka, that is, between the 92nd Assault Brigade and the 28th Mech Brigade. On the other hand, in Kurdyumivka the presence of the 177th Naval Infantry Regiment of the Caspian Flotilla was confirmed by geolocations, after Mashovets had reported they were spotted there in late December, when they arrived from Kherson to replace the 57th Motorized Brigade of the 5th Army (EMD). In the area there are also elements of the 7th Military Base (49th Army, SMD) as well as of the \"Cossack Volunteer Assault Corps\u201d, which also have a large presence in Bakhmut's northern flank.\n\nHorlivka Sector. The 225th Separate Assault Battalion (as far as I have read, it is supposed to have been reformed and is no longer part of the 127th TDF Brigade) recently captured a gas substation (or at least, drove the Russians out of there) between Niu-York and Horlivka, which was a Russian position along the 2015 lines.\n\nAvdiivka Sector: we\u2019ll check it tomorrow.\n\nMarinka Sector. Russians from the 5th Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps continue to push towards Heorhiivka, defended by the 46th Airmobile Brigade. According to a geolocation published today, they have advanced about 800 meters, north of the lake, towards the village, after having captured the two forest belts to the north-east of this area. \n\nIn Krasnohorivka (the one near Marinka, not near Avdiivka) the arrival of the 3rd Battalion of the 80th Air Assault Brigade from Bakhmut's southern flank seems confirmed. Pobjeda is defended by a battalion of the 95th Air Assault Brigade. In general, this area appears to be defended mainly by a grouping of the Ukrainian Air Assault Forces. The 103rd Motorized Regiment of the 150th Motorized Division is trying to push towards Pobjeda from Marinka but without success, while the 255th Motorized Regiment of the 20th Motorized Division (8th Army, SMD) is attempting to do the same thing from the east, but with the same results. The 20th Motorized Division is supported by the 1219th and 1465th Regiments of the Territorial Forces.\n\nThere were Russian successes near Novomykhailivka, however. The 33rd Motorized Regiment of the 20th Motorized Division managed to capture the fortified farm \u201cZverinets\", advancing 2,6 kms westwards. Novomykhailivka is in danger of finding itself surrounded on three sides. The village is defended by the 79th Air Assault Brigade and the bulk of 116th TDF Brigade, and elements of the 23rd Mech Brigade have arrived last month \u2013 at first this was claimed by Russian sources, and then DeepState reported a serious war crime: the execution of 6 POWs from this brigade around Novomykhailivka, although there is no video evidence of this. This brigade therefore is now divided between here and the north-eastern flank of Avdiivka, confirming that it has been completely withdrawn from the Orikhiv sector.\n\nThe 155th Naval Infantry Brigade of the Pacific Fleet, recently reinforced by a battalion of the 40th Naval Infantry Brigade of the same fleet, as well as elements of the OBTF \"Kaskad\" (which last month switched from the subordination to the 1st Corps to being under the Rosgvardia), are attacking towards this village from the east. Yesterday, according to geolocations, they managed to enter the village and to occupy a few hundred meters in the eastern end of it. \n\nThe 39th Motorized Brigade of the 68th Corps (EMD) is continuing to push from Solodke both towards Novomykhailivka and the Kostyantynivka-Vuhledar road, supported by the 139th Separate Assault Battalion of the 29th Army (EMD) and the 1442nd Regiment of the Territorial Forces. Elements of the 72nd Mech Brigade (its 2nd Mech Battalion and its 48th Rifle Battalion), recently reinforced by elements of the 31st Mech Brigade (this brigade covers also the northern flank of Avdiivka, where they were recently joined by the 71st Jager Brigade) were deployed to stop the Russian advances towards the road and thus the Vodiane area, and they appear to have succeeded in halting them at the moment. The Russians had major losses in a failed mechanized attack in the direction of Vodiane. According to both Mashovets and Kovalenko, the 39th Motorized Brigade is beginning to lose combat capability.\n\nVuhledar sector. The only thing to report, other than the relocation here of the 57th Motorized Brigade of the 5th Army (EMD) from the southern flank of Bakhmut, is that a video that was released yesterday showed Ukrainian shelling of a tree line north of Mykilske, which would show that the Russians in that forest belt are about 1 km further north than previously believed. In any case, it\u2019s a news of limited scope and there is nothing else to report.\n\nVelyka Novosilka sector. The 143rd Motorized Regiment and the 218th Tank Regiment of the 127th Motorized Division (5th Army, EMD) succeeded, during late January, in advancing more than 1 km from Pryyutne in the direction of Novodarivka, conquering the heights immediately to the north of the former village, in the defense area of the 127th TDF Brigade. \n\nPolohy sector. Nothing to write.\n\nOrikhiv sector. The series of Russian counterattacks that began in late November seems to have culminated, despite the relocation of part of the Ukrainian brigades deployed here to Avdiivka and Marinka. The Ukrainians, probably the \"Kara-Dag\" Brigade of the Offensive Guard, have regained ground for about 900 meters between Verbove and Novopokrovka in a 1,5 km-wide section, approaching again Hill 140, which nevertheless remains in Russian hands. The trench system between Robotyne and Novoprokopivka is in Ukrainian hands and Russian attacks towards it have failed. \n\nKamyanske sector. Nothing to write.\n\nKherson Sector/Dnipro River. In the Krynky bridgehead, the 35th and 36th Marine Brigades have returned to be increasingly active lately. Beside the Marine Corps, there is a fair grouping of TDF brigades along the Dnipro in the right bank: the 121st, 122nd, 123rd, 124th and 126th, and elements of the 106th also appear to have arrived recently. Subunits of at least the 126th, 122nd and 121st TDF Brigades have been directly involved in the actions in Krynky. \n\nAlthough the Ukrainians likely no longer control the forested area south-east of the settlement, they have managed to expand the area under their control in Krynky: there are geolocations showing the Ukrainians in the territory which was supposed to be under Russian control, both in the direction of Kozachi Laheri and in the direction of Korsunka. In the former, Ukrainians were detected near the museum, further south compared to Russian-held positions; in the latter, an Ukrainian flag has been planted further north compared to the post office, which had been retaken by the Russians in January. In the same area, however, there have been FPV drone attacks against the Russians, which signals that the situation is very fluid and costantly evolving. However, the Ukrainians, arriving by boat over the Konka River, have the possibility of actions against the territory that had already been recaptured by the Russians. \n\nIn any case, it must be pointed out that after almost 4 months since the first Ukrainian presence, the Russians are still unable to dislodge the Ukrainians from Krynky, despite a huge numerical superiority: elements of the 70th Motorized Division and the 144th Motorized Brigade of the 18th Army (SMD), the 104th VDV Division, the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade of the Black Sea Fleet are engaged against Krynky - the 81st Special Purpose Brigade, actually a PMC associated with the Redut galaxy, should be in action here as well.\n\nKovalenko listed the ouster of Ukrainians from Krynky as one of the two Russia's top priorities before their presidential elections in mid-March, along with the capture of Avdiivka.\n\nThe intensity of bombings with KABs here has dropped since the SU-34s were shot down in December. Although those missing KABs are being employed in another sector, as we shall see. \n\nSee you tomorrow for Avdiivka!",

In any case, it\u2019s a news of limited scope and there is nothing else to report.</p>\n\n<p>Velyka Novosilka sector. The 143rd Motorized Regiment and the 218th Tank Regiment of the 127th Motorized Division (5th Army, EMD) succeeded, during late January, in advancing more than 1 km from Pryyutne in the direction of Novodarivka, conquering the heights immediately to the north of the former village, in the defense area of the 127th TDF Brigade. </p>\n\n<p>Polohy sector. Nothing to write.</p>\n\n<p>Orikhiv sector. The series of Russian counterattacks that began in late November seems to have culminated, despite the relocation of part of the Ukrainian brigades deployed here to Avdiivka and Marinka. The Ukrainians, probably the &quot;Kara-Dag&quot; Brigade of the Offensive Guard, have regained ground for about 900 meters between Verbove and Novopokrovka in a 1,5 km-wide section, approaching again Hill 140, which nevertheless remains in Russian hands. The trench system between Robotyne and Novoprokopivka is in Ukrainian hands and Russian attacks towards it have failed. </p>\n\n<p>Kamyanske sector. Nothing to write.</p>\n\n<p>Kherson Sector/Dnipro River. In the Krynky bridgehead, the 35th and 36th Marine Brigades have returned to be increasingly active lately. Beside the Marine Corps, there is a fair grouping of TDF brigades along the Dnipro in the right bank: the 121st, 122nd, 123rd, 124th and 126th, and elements of the 106th also appear to have arrived recently. Subunits of at least the 126th, 122nd and 121st TDF Brigades have been directly involved in the actions in Krynky. </p>\n\n<p>Although the Ukrainians likely no longer control the forested area south-east of the settlement, they have managed to expand the area under their control in Krynky: there are geolocations showing the Ukrainians in the territory which was supposed to be under Russian control, both in the direction of Kozachi Laheri and in the direction of Korsunka. In the former, Ukrainians were detected near the museum, further south compared to Russian-held positions; in the latter, an Ukrainian flag has been planted further north compared to the post office, which had been retaken by the Russians in January. In the same area, however, there have been FPV drone attacks against the Russians, which signals that the situation is very fluid and costantly evolving. However, the Ukrainians, arriving by boat over the Konka River, have the possibility of actions against the territory that had already been recaptured by the Russians. </p>\n\n<p>In any case, it must be pointed out that after almost 4 months since the first Ukrainian presence, the Russians are still unable to dislodge the Ukrainians from Krynky, despite a huge numerical superiority: elements of the 70th Motorized Division and the 144th Motorized Brigade of the 18th Army (SMD), the 104th VDV Division, the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade of the Black Sea Fleet are engaged against Krynky - the 81st Special Purpose Brigade, actually a PMC associated with the Redut galaxy, should be in action here as well.</p>\n\n<p>Kovalenko listed the ouster of Ukrainians from Krynky as one of the two Russia&#39;s top priorities before their presidential elections in mid-March, along with the capture of Avdiivka.</p>\n\n<p>The intensity of bombings with KABs here has dropped since the SU-34s were shot down in December. Although those missing KABs are being employed in another sector, as we shall see. </p>\n\n<p>See you tomorrow for Avdiivka!</p>\n</div>",

                "body": "I think a lot of Republicans in Congress are sick of the dysfunction. \n\nIt seems like the hawkish and moderate members went along with the border provisions as it was a smart strategy to extract concessions out of Democrats to eventually pass a bill they supported anyway. The frustrating part was that it worked; the Republicans got tighter immigration reforms and border security funding - including for 900 more miles of border wall - while the Democrats didn't get a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers like they've asked in the 2013 and 2018 talks. The only \"boon\" they got was faster work permits which, with 3.7% unemployment, was a boon to the traditional Republican base of businesses. Hell, even the Border Patrol Union and Chamber of Commerce supported the bill. \n\nAnd yet, some members of the GOP threw it all away and even threw Lankford, the second most conservative senator, under the bus (and backed over, as he said). Most burned any sort of good relationship with him by not only throwing him under the bus for the bill, but outright lying to his face. As he said, Senators that said they needed at least 3 weeks to consider the text of the bill came out within an hour opposing it. Even Democrats were shocked. They expected Republicans to lie to them - really, that's just politics - but they didn't expect them to lie to Lankford. \n\nAt this point, how do you have a party when you can't trust the majority of your party members, even those within your own faction? Even if you're not loyal to party leadership, being loyal to your personal relationships still matters. Ultimately, politics is about those personal relationships and having trust within the party to be able to negotiate outside it.

                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I think a lot of Republicans in Congress are sick of the dysfunction. </p>\n\n<p>It seems like the hawkish and moderate members went along with the border provisions as it was a smart strategy to extract concessions out of Democrats to eventually pass a bill they supported anyway. The frustrating part was that it worked; the Republicans got tighter immigration reforms and border security funding - including for 900 more miles of border wall - while the Democrats didn&#39;t get a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers like they&#39;ve asked in the 2013 and 2018 talks. The only &quot;boon&quot; they got was faster work permits which, with 3.7% unemployment, was a boon to the traditional Republican base of businesses. Hell, even the Border Patrol Union and Chamber of Commerce supported the bill. </p>\n\n<p>And yet, some members of the GOP threw it all away and even threw Lankford, the second most conservative senator, under the bus (and backed over, as he said). Most burned any sort of good relationship with him by not only throwing him under the bus for the bill, but outright lying to his face. As he said, Senators that said they needed at least 3 weeks to consider the text of the bill came out within an hour opposing it. Even Democrats were shocked. They expected Republicans to lie to them - really, that&#39;s just politics - but they didn&#39;t expect them to lie to Lankford. </p>\n\n<p>At this point, how do you have a party when you can&#39;t trust the majority of your party members, even those within your own faction? Even if you&#39;re not loyal to party leadership, being loyal to your personal relationships still matters. Ultimately, politics is about those personal relationships and having trust within the party to be able to negotiate outside it. And that&#39;s what the GOP has lost. </p>\n\n<p>McConnell and McCarthy never wanted the border provisions tacked to aid.

                    "body": "We are witnessing political realignment in real time, much as occurred with Lincoln's Republican Party replacing the Whigs after a period of chaos following the Whigs' collapse in the late 1850s. If we are witnessing such a realignment, that means the boundaries between the parties are less clearly delineated and we are more likely to see individual proclivities driving decisions where, in the past, party politics may have enforced discipline with sufficient rigor and consistency that any individual lawmaker's views generally did not matter enough to influence outcomes. If you were a Republican, you had to vote Republican on Republican bills and the same went for Dems on Dem bills, with leadership largely driving the contents of the bills and more junior members of the caucus left with little practical say about what gets passed into law.\n\nThat operating paradigm limited the power of the smaller sub-factions within each party to push Congress into adopting more radical legislation. Ever since Reagan, though, Republican political power has rested on a delicate alliance between such factions, specifically between the religious right, big business, gun owners, and generic xenophobes/racists. The Republicans have succeeded in bundling religious and identity \"wedge\" issues that especially appeal to single issue voters with generally unpopular economic policies, effectively motivating poorer voters to support policies that are against their economic interests but are favored by big business. Those policies consisting primarily of lower taxes on corporations and on wealthy individual taxpayers combined with an overall looser regulatory environment, which many blue collar Rs are willing to accept in exchange for stronger social regulations that favor their religious and/or racial/cultural in-group.\n\nThe problem for GOP leadership is that this alliance depends on the GOP never actually delivering on any of its promises to its religious and xenophobic wings. For a few reasons. \n\nFirst, because if they actually succeed in banning abortion, blocking all immigration, removing all government support for minorities, and otherwise establishing Christian theocratic laws, then suddenly there is no motivation for blue collar voters to betray their economic interests and the Republican alliance no longer works. Since that will likely never happen in a single moment but rather slowly over a period of time spanning multiple elections, the effect of adopting such policies is to peal some percentage of support away from the GOP during each election in turn as individual voters assign relatively more weight to economic issues as their social concerns are addressed, resulting in a declining support for GOP economic policies and ultimately a breakdown in the alliance. In any case, the big business wing simply won't agree to such extreme policies, because it does not benefit them and in fact undermines their power by reducing the loyalty of conservative voters to their cause. The many corporations which historically have been happy to support conservative politicians but that boycott South Carolina after its particularly odious anti-trans bill was adopted exemplify this dynamic. Ultimately, the utility of single issue voters is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, they can be convinced to vote for absolutely horrendous policies if those policies are bundled with their single issue. On the other hand, their loyalty to the party is weak, and might disappear as soon as their issue is resolved.\n\nSecond, because these socially conservative and single issue voter policies are almost universally bad for business, and thus are not actually supported by the business wing of the party except to the extent that they may pay lip-service to conservative values. e.g., banning immigration increases labor costs; being associated with abortion politics can damage a business's brand, which in many cases may be international and thus rely on goodwill from people in countries with substantially more liberal abortion politics; increased gun violence increases the costs of healthcare and law enforcement and thus taxes; racially discriminatory policies increase crime rates and thus damage the economy; etc. \n\nThird, as the Republicans succeed in achieving their more radical social and religious objectives, it naturally provokes stronger opposition from secularists on the left and on the right, including improving turnout for liberals and pushing some otherwise libertarian-leaning Rs out of the party's alliance altogether. \n\nAt this point in time, the GOP has enjoyed a generation of economic policy dominance, with 40 years of extremely low tax rates and generally loose and loosening regulatory supervision. Yet the party is only now beginning to deliver on its social and religious agendas, after gaining a two-seat advantage in the Supreme Court, which has accepted lawsuits challenging pro-choice precedent and attempting to establish novel rights around what is misleadingly called \"religious liberty.\" With lifetime appointments, SCOTUS justices are freer to impose socially conservative policies than Republican legislators who must answer to voters once every two or six years.\n\nThis acceleration in the religious agenda has provoked the predictable backlash from the left and libertarian right I mentioned above, e.g. as seen with voter turnout during the Ohio election last year, when they enshrined a guaranteed right to abortion in the state constitution via plebiscite. Increasingly, the socially conservative and xenophobic elements in the GOP have consolidated into a more radical, MAGA-oriented voting bloc, with the more economically motivated members tending toward a more moderate style of politics in line with the historical traditions of the US Congress. Which makes some sense. The economically conservative are at worst passively selfish or cynical about exercising power transactionally, not actively motivated by a desire to harm others or fundamentalist commitment to an ideology, and there are limits on how far they can be pushed into accepting Trump's punitive style of politics. Most of them are not particularly interested in living in an actual theocracy any more than those on the left are. They also tend toward a more transactional style, and thus are willing to compromise when offered sufficient inducement. Whereas religious fundamentalists and xenophobes are naturally more inclined toward extremist beliefs and rigidly enforced principles, and thus more willing to empower the government to punish people they don't like and less willing to accept compromise solutions. Even when those compromises are wildly favorable to the conservative cause, such as this border bill. At some point along the path of descent into a full-on fascist Christian theocracy, though, no amount of bribery will keep the moderates on-side with the ever growing infringements of American liberties, and the alliance will start to break down. Or perhaps already has started to do so.\n\nYet even SCOTUS overturning *Roe* and various states' adopting anti-abortion laws has not upset the delicate balance between the primarily socially conservative and primarily economically conservative wings of the GOP as much as Trump has with his bull-in-a-china-shop approach to politics. Trump clearly fits into the transactional, moderate wing of the party in terms of his actual policy inclinations and revealed policy preferences, but he is so insanely narcissistic that he is willing to sacrifice literally anything at all for his own benefit, and thus whole-heartedly hopped into bed with the extremist wing of the party. His willingness to engage in bad faith abuse of the rules and the system is shameless. Whereas more traditional GOP politicians could not have torpedoed the border deal for fear of blow back, Trump has no problem openly admitting that he wants to hurt the country to improve his own electoral chances. Which his base seems callow enough to accept. Nixon had to hide his interference in LBJ's Vietnam peace talks in 1968, Reagan had to hide messing with the Iran hostage negotiations. Yet Trump can actively and publicly work to damage the country and his own party's political agenda in a cynical bid to increase his own electoral chances with apparent impunity.\n\nThat puts moderates in a terrible position. Their brand relies on keeping taxes low and preventing the government from messing with the economy, not blind adherence to Christian theocracy. Moderate districts are also more vulnerable to a Democratic challenger, so they are more likely to suffer consequences if perceived as intentionally hurting the US.\n\nVoters aren't *that* stupid. They recognize that there will always be periods where their party is not in power, and that the system must continue to function during those periods, at least at the basic level of passing funding bills to keep the lights on in government. Trump might be able to own that kind of intentionally destructive, obstructionist strategy because of his inexplicable hold over his base, but the moderate Rs need to hide their obstructionism with at least a fig leaf of politically palatable justification. Trump has taken even that fig leaf away from them, which in turn puts them in the difficult position of having to balance their loyalty to the party against their personal electoral chances and increases the odds they will decline to vote along party lines. All of which lays the groundwork for a potentially permanent fracture within the Republican Party, which may evolve into a full realignment with the establishment of a new conservative party or parties. We will likely see increasing instances of GOP party members breaking the party's reputation for disciplined voting and messaging under these pressures. And then, just as you say, legislation becomes more \"wrapped up in Congress members' personal feelings now rather than policy or strategy.\"",

In comparison he US Army has 5,000. For Ukraine: they need about\n\n* 1,000 infantry mortars\n* 1,000 self propelled mortars (think APC with mortar attached)\n* 500 more towed\n* 500 more SPG\n* Accompanying ammunition supply\n\n**AFVs**\n\nAFVs aren't the biggest deciding factor here. More modern tanks would help, but the current style of warfare means not that much. However, changing their fleet over to NATO tanks would increase crew survivability. Let's say 1,000 NATO tanks. IFVs would be a better investment as they increase survivability compared to COMBLOC equipment. 2,000 modern IFVs would do it. APCs are actually more in demand, but if you push down all the COMBLOC equipment that they're using for IFVs into APCs, you don't need to supply any. 300 Armored Recovery Vehicles for the new tanks. They need a lot more de-mining vehicles, maybe about 300? It depends. Also about the same in engineering vehicles. Maybe 100 bridging vehicles for the tanks. In summary:\n\n* 1,000 NATO tanks\n* 2,000 NATO IFVs\n* No APCs as all COMBLOC IFVs become APCs\n* 300 ARVs\n* 300 de-mining vehicles\n* 300 engineering vehicles\n* 100 bridging vehicles\n\n**Mobility**\n\nUkraine also has trouble moving equipment and people around. They need trucks, infantry vehicles, and MRAPS. I'm less sure on these numbers\n\n* 5,000 HMMVs\n* 2,000 MRAPS\n* 5,000 logistics vehicles\n\n**Communication equipment**\n\nComms in Ukraine are unsecured, which hurts their ability to communicate but also to use EW against drones. So you're going to need a lot of this. New vehicles will help, but it needs to be with every infantry group too. So we're talking tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of radios and other communication devices.\n\n**Night vision equipment**\n\nUkraine has a desperate need of night vision equipment. New vehicles will help once again, but the infantry needs this as well. You're likely not going to equip every infantryman with night vision goggles. So let's just say 100,000 pairs to start. \n\n**Monetary aid**\n\nFor monetary aid, the IMF predicts a $37bn dollar deficit this year whereas Ukraine predicts $40bn. Looking at the proposed budget, they expect their defense costs to go down 1/3, which is unrealistic. So I'd peg their deficit at $60bn this year. That's on top of outside aid that comes into Ukraine that doesn't hit their budget. So there's the baseline for this year. \n\nI'd actually double the monetary support to $120bn. That way they can offer more money to entice more Ukrainians to serve in the military, helping with their manpower shortages. Also to pay off more public debt to outside creditors to prevent default, and setting themselves up to take on more debt if need be later. \n\n**Summary**\n\nSo as you can see, the true funds needed will vastly exceed $100bn. It's likely hit over $500bn.",

They've been so ludicrously wrong in basically everything they've written or said about this war. \n\nIn terms of reforms, the UAF was largely solid garbage throughout the 2000s and well into the Donbas War, where at the start only five brigades could even be said to be partially combat ready. \n\nSince then, most of the supposed reforms talked about where they are \"basically NATO\" never came to be. \n\nThe branch that did reform the most were SSO, aka SOF, who between Iraq deployments and working with 10th SFG and various JSOC units since 2014 essentially copied them. They're actually pretty good from what I hear. \n\nI've read some good things about the Air Assault Forces, more than Ground Forces, which seems pretty backwards. Not much good at all from their Air Force. But overall a lot of the talk of getting to NATO standards was just talk, part of a legit and much needed campaign to both get more military support and trying to join NATO, which obviously required them to talk up NATO abilities and how much they wanted to copy them. I totally get why they were saying it, I don't begrudge them as their national survival literally required them to suck up to the West, but they're not close to NATO standards, minus bad NATO militaries. \n\nThere was a push for more initiative for junior leaders. But it isn't universal and especially doesn't seem to be part of mission planning and execution for offensives. For every claim I hear they are using it I seem to hear others saying that aren't. Though I will say that minus Wagner, they are far better about it than any Russian military force, so it's safe to say give them that reform.\n\nThere was talk about developing a long serving professional NCO Corps but that hadn't happened before the war started. And even that's not a NATO thing, even the Russians were trying to do that too since 2009.\n\nThe UAF organization system, tactics, doctrine, culture is all still as Soviet as it comes, way closer to Russia than anything in NATO, minus a few ex-Warsaw Pact or Soviet members who still haven't shed their Soviet legacy (Hungary, Romania, Baltics, etc). Nothing like US, UK, FR, GE, etc. \n\nEven the tactics, techniques, and procedures taught to them by the US Army and British Army since 2015, that was very bread and butter basic stuff, and nothing above the battalion level, their senior officers weren't involved. It was better than nothing but it was never intended to turn them into the US Army. The training wasn't even meant for the UAF, it was originally just for the Ukrainian National Guard, which stood up in 2014 but was totally untrained, but by 2015 they started allowing UAF units to rotate through too, which should give an indication of the simplicity of the curriculum.\n\nMost of the current UAF key senior officers never did any joint rotations with NATO militaries (Kosovo, Iraq), never attended military schools in the West, never participated in exchange programs, etc. If the UAF really had such an emphasis on emulating NATO, those officers who did would hold the key positions in the UAF, especially at the top levels.

They&#39;ve been so ludicrously wrong in basically everything they&#39;ve written or said about this war. </p>\n\n<p>In terms of reforms, the UAF was largely solid garbage throughout the 2000s and well into the Donbas War, where at the start only five brigades could even be said to be partially combat ready. </p>\n\n<p>Since then, most of the supposed reforms talked about where they are &quot;basically NATO&quot; never came to be. </p>\n\n<p>The branch that did reform the most were SSO, aka SOF, who between Iraq deployments and working with 10th SFG and various JSOC units since 2014 essentially copied them. They&#39;re actually pretty good from what I hear. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve read some good things about the Air Assault Forces, more than Ground Forces, which seems pretty backwards. Not much good at all from their Air Force. But overall a lot of the talk of getting to NATO standards was just talk, part of a legit and much needed campaign to both get more military support and trying to join NATO, which obviously required them to talk up NATO abilities and how much they wanted to copy them. I totally get why they were saying it, I don&#39;t begrudge them as their national survival literally required them to suck up to the West, but they&#39;re not close to NATO standards, minus bad NATO militaries. </p>\n\n<p>There was a push for more initiative for junior leaders. But it isn&#39;t universal and especially doesn&#39;t seem to be part of mission planning and execution for offensives. For every claim I hear they are using it I seem to hear others saying that aren&#39;t. Though I will say that minus Wagner, they are far better about it than any Russian military force, so it&#39;s safe to say give them that reform.</p>\n\n<p>There was talk about developing a long serving professional NCO Corps but that hadn&#39;t happened before the war started. And even that&#39;s not a NATO thing, even the Russians were trying to do that too since 2009.</p>\n\n<p>The UAF organization system, tactics, doctrine, culture is all still as Soviet as it comes, way closer to Russia than anything in NATO, minus a few ex-Warsaw Pact or Soviet members who still haven&#39;t shed their Soviet legacy (Hungary, Romania, Baltics, etc). Nothing like US, UK, FR, GE, etc. </p>\n\n<p>Even the tactics, techniques, and procedures taught to them by the US Army and British Army since 2015, that was very bread and butter basic stuff, and nothing above the battalion level, their senior officers weren&#39;t involved. It was better than nothing but it was never intended to turn them into the US Army. The training wasn&#39;t even meant for the UAF, it was originally just for the Ukrainian National Guard, which stood up in 2014 but was totally untrained, but by 2015 they started allowing UAF units to rotate through too, which should give an indication of the simplicity of the curriculum.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the current UAF key senior officers never did any joint rotations with NATO militaries (Kosovo, Iraq), never attended military schools in the West, never participated in exchange programs, etc. If the UAF really had such an emphasis on emulating NATO, those officers who did would hold the key positions in the UAF, especially at the top levels. There are some, the current deputy of the UAF is one of them, but it seems he got that job only because he got fired from the last job for whatever reasons. </p>\n\n<p>Zaluzhny&#39;s never done anything with the West, that&#39;s for sure.</p>\n</div>",
