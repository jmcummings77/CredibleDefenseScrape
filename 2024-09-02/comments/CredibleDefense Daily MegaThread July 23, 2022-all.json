Our defence editor picks five books that help make sense of how wars are fought today*\n\nhttps://www.economist.com/the-economist-reads/2022/07/19/what-to-read-to-understand-modern-warfare\n\nThe war in Ukraine is a curious mix of old and new. Soldiers crouch in trenches that would not be out of place in Verdun, were it not for the glimpse of a reconnaissance drone above. Some Ukrainian gunners receive orders via Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink constellation of satellites. \n\nOthers fire artillery pieces that pre-date the Cuban missile crisis. Chinese-made quadcopters drop 1940s-vintage grenades on unsuspecting Russian tanks. It has the feel of a steampunk novel by Tom Clancy. Making sense of all this can be tricky. Conscription has ebbed away in America and most big European countries, so military matters seem rarefied. The Western wars of the past 30 years have been waged largely against assorted insurgents and guerrillas; the sound of big guns once more pounding out duels within Europe is disorienting. How to understand it all? This selection of five books should help you brush up on modern warfare.\n\n**The Face of Battle. By John Keegan.** Penguin Books; 384 pages; $18. Bodley Head; \u00a316.99\n\nA lot of military history is a snoozefest: hagiographies of generals and bloodless accounts of obscure engagements. So when John Keegan, a lecturer at Sandhurst, Britain\u2019s military academy, published \u201cThe Face of Battle\u201d in 1976, it was an instant classic. The book examines three seminal battles\u2014Agincourt, Waterloo and the Somme\u2014at the level of the individuals who fought them. \u201cInside every army is a crowd struggling to get out,\u201d writes Keegan, \u201ca human assembly animated not by discipline but by mood\u201d. The line is sometimes barely discernible. In the first world war, entire battalions came into being \u201cwhen a train load of a thousand volunteers was tipped out on to a rural railway platform in front of a single officer\u201d. In Ukraine, conscripts have been thrown into the meat-grinder with little training. Keegan vividly describes how booze, religion, fatigue, honour, the promise of loot and raw coercion keep soldiers from fleeing. Men in close combat will eventually break, though, in little under a year in the case of the second world war. Modern battles have drones, artificial intelligence and hypersonic missiles. But their aim is the same\u2014\u201cfor it is towards the disintegration of human groups that battle is directed\u201d. (We reviewed another of Mr Keegan\u2019s books, on the American civil war, in 2009.)\n\n**Military Power: Explaining Victory and Defeat in Modern Battle.** By Stephen Biddle. Princeton University Press; 352 pages; $39.95 and \u00a330\n\nThe battle for Kyiv was a powerful reminder that small armies can, and often do, frustrate larger and richer ones. But why? Stephen Biddle offers a compelling (if, in places, technical) explanation. By 1914 modern weaponry had become so lethal that infantry could not advance without being shredded to pieces. What broke the trench stalemate in 1918 was a complex bundle of new tactics that Biddle calls the \u201cmodern system\u201d. The apocalyptic artillery barrages of Passchendaele gave way to shorter, sharper bursts designed to force defenders to hunker down, not obliterate them. Small, dispersed infantry teams, armed with machine guns and grenades, advanced under cover and concealment afforded by the terrain. Powerful armies that neglect these principles get unstuck\u2014or, like Iraq in 1991, wiped out. Small ones that heed them can survive even against a blitz of advanced precision weapons, as al-Qaeda did in the Afghan mountains in the spring of 2002. There are vital lessons for armies, argues Mr Biddle: training and skill are more important than kit, boots on the ground remain vital and infantry will have the edge over heavy armour.\n\n**The Tank Debate: Armour and the Anglo-American Military Tradition.** By John Stone. Taylor & Francis; 210 pages; $62.95 and \u00a346.99\n\n\u201cTime after time during the past 40 years the highest defence authorities have announced that the tank is dead or dying,\u201d wrote Basil Liddell Hart, the British military theorist, in 1960. \u201cEach time it has risen from the grave to which they have consigned it\u201d. Sure enough, when Egypt hammered Israeli armour in the Yom Kippur war of 1973, many were quick to write off the tank. The Israelis did not. They quickly realised that tanks needed infantry to protect them, and that the enemy squads wielding anti-tank missiles were themselves quite vulnerable. The point, as John Stone explains, is not that technology will make tanks obsolete; technology can help them adapt, too. It is that technology and tactics have to be in tune. Mr Stone argues that the current generation of American and British tanks, the Challenger and Abrams series, were first designed in the 1970s when armies anticipated close-up slugfests rather than the fluid manoeuvre warfare that came into fashion in the 1980s. They therefore prioritised heavy armour and big guns over mobility; Soviet-era tanks, by contrast, are cheap, light and quick. But, as we explained in a recent interactive piece, Russian tank crews in Ukraine proved so inept that these advantages counted for little.\n\n**Army of None: Autonomous Weapons and the Future of War.** By Paul Scharre. W.W. Norton; 448 pages; $18.95\n\nMy previous three suggestions all emphasise continuity in warfare: Keegan\u2019s irreducible clash of human on human, Mr Biddle\u2019s paean to century-old tactics and Mr Stone\u2019s account of why tanks keep staging comebacks. In contrast, Paul Scharre, a former army officer and Pentagon official, considers a rupture: weapons that have increasing freedom to choose their own targets. Their antecedent is the acoustic homing torpedo of 1943, which could latch onto the sound of a ship\u2019s propellers. The mature example is the loitering munition: a drone-missile hybrid, employed by both sides in Ukraine, which can be sent to wander an area until it detects a suitable target. Discussions on this topic are liable to get carried away in speculative visions of Terminator-like sentient weaponry; the value of Mr Scharre\u2019s book, which we reviewed in 2018, is that it is grounded in history as much as futurology. He argues that important lessons might be gleaned from air-defence systems like America\u2019s Patriot missiles and the ship-based Aegis. Such systems have long had to make complex decisions, at superhuman speed, about which incoming targets to engage\u2014and they sometimes get it catastrophically wrong. \u201cHumanity,\u201d he concludes, \u201cis at the threshold of a new technology that could fundamentally change our relationship with war\u201d.\n\n**Supplying War: Logistics from Wallenstein to Patton.** By Martin van Creveld. Cambridge University Press; 328 pages; $39.99 and \u00a329.99\n\nIn the first half of the 17th century, writes Martin van Creveld, an Israeli military historian, an army going to war took with it 100 balls per artillery barrel. No barrel would be expected to fire more than five times a day. On an average day in Ukraine, Russian guns fire 400 times and eat through more than 7,000 rounds, on one estimate. Hauling that much ammo is a herculean task. Logistics is not sexy, but it is vital to modern warfare. Russia\u2019s logistical woes contributed to its quagmire around Kyiv in February and March. Ukraine\u2019s use of American rockets to blow up Russian depots this month is premised on gumming up Russian supplies. \u201cSupplying War\u201d is not the most up-to-date treatment of the topic\u2014opt for \u201cMilitary Logistics and Strategic Performance\u201d by Thomas Kane if you\u2019re a Russian staff officer trying to make amends\u2014but it is the most readable. \u201cA real revolution,\u201d says Mr van Creveld, \u201cwill take place only when soldiers get tired of firing heavy metal projectiles at one another and start using weightless laser beams instead.\u201d \u25a0",

Ukraine\u2019s use of American rockets to blow up Russian depots this month is premised on gumming up Russian supplies. \u201cSupplying War\u201d is not the most up-to-date treatment of the topic\u2014opt for \u201cMilitary Logistics and Strategic Performance\u201d by Thomas Kane if you\u2019re a Russian staff officer trying to make amends\u2014but it is the most readable. \u201cA real revolution,\u201d says Mr van Creveld, \u201cwill take place only when soldiers get tired of firing heavy metal projectiles at one another and start using weightless laser beams instead.\u201d \u25a0</p>\n</div>",

Instead, it seems like he's making decisions based on the fake world he lives in. And that world is one that is detached from reality. In that world, it is Putin's destiny and right to restore Russia's greatness to what it was before Boris Yeltsin destroyed Russia. \n\nSo don't think of Putin as a leader looking out for his country. Don't look at him as a dictator interested in becoming more powerful. Instead, look at him as a man with an obsession. The obsession is to restore the former greatness of Russia. Nothing else matters to him.\n\nOh and the way he exercises power is through brutal force. \"Do as I say or suffer.\"\n\nWhen you think of him that way, then it makes sense why he does what he does. He doesn't want to allow food to flow from Ukraine because then the grain in Russia is worth less. If he can't control the grain, then nobody can. Ukraine didn't submit, so they should suffer. \n\nAgreements are just paper to Putin. He has shown he will not honor any agreement. Instead, to Putin, agreements are a tool to manipulate others.

Additionally, I just can't imagine that this would serve any real benefit for Russia post-negotiation. If it was to make them look \"tough\" it doesn't really do that unless it's explicit, and Russia outright refused to own it. That's not being tough, that's just being ratty and doesn't really serve any purpose at all. Added to that, Russia wants to negotiate a beneficial (to them) end to this war if they can, they know that outright conquest is a dream, so why would they intentionally undermine their best negotiation effort so far? Finally, Russia is trying to portray itself as the hero of this deal and the champion of countries that would have starved without it, so why would they suddenly put themselves in the position of saboteur? It really makes no sense.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I will add, I think the only explanation of this being intentional is ignorance in and of itself. In short, Russia wants to act like a bully, a sort of \"we could do this more if we wanted to, don't forget that grrrrr\" action, which in and of itself is just kind of ignorant. That is a petulant action that does seem to suit the Russians these days. I doubt there's anything more to it than that.",

That&#39;s not being tough, that&#39;s just being ratty and doesn&#39;t really serve any purpose at all. Added to that, Russia wants to negotiate a beneficial (to them) end to this war if they can, they know that outright conquest is a dream, so why would they intentionally undermine their best negotiation effort so far? Finally, Russia is trying to portray itself as the hero of this deal and the champion of countries that would have starved without it, so why would they suddenly put themselves in the position of saboteur? It really makes no sense.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I will add, I think the only explanation of this being intentional is ignorance in and of itself. In short, Russia wants to act like a bully, a sort of &quot;we could do this more if we wanted to, don&#39;t forget that grrrrr&quot; action, which in and of itself is just kind of ignorant. That is a petulant action that does seem to suit the Russians these days. I doubt there&#39;s anything more to it than that.</p>\n</div>",

Moscow is stronger than Kyiv. Moscow has more to offer us than Kyiv. Moscow wanted quite badly to be allied with the west a couple decades ago. Many people have pointed out that allying with Moscow would beat useful way to contain China. And yet as Russia has increasingly abandoned democracy and asserted itself upon it's former colonies, the west has pulled farther and farther away from it.\n\nIt's because of our principles, which are contrary to everything Russia is doing.\n\n>I think everybody looks at the principles the same way. We are just prone to lie to ourselves more. If we weren't would we be going to Riad to kiss the hand of people-chopping dictators?\n\nIt's because the West balances itself between practicality and principle. The West isn't strong enough to tell every dictator in the world to piss off at the same time without suffering substantial harm.\n\nAs a general rule, that means that the west tolerates and works with dictators who don't threaten the west, especially when they can assist against a stronger dictator. So for example, the US was working on trying to find a way to squeeze Maduro out of power for years, then did an immediate 180 and is now buddying up to him, because he can help weaken Russia. Similarly, the west has tolerated the Saudis for years because they provide a critical resource and are generally willing to avoid rocking the boat.\n\nMany people, including me, often think the west caters to dictators more than we need to. But everyone should recognize that a balance is being sought and that principle has a role alongside self interest, even if it isn't as dominant a role as many of us would like.\n\nAnd working more based off principle than any other competitor is good for the west. It means that we look more at mutual benefit than self-interest countries like Russia (especially) or China (somewhat), which means that more people are interested in working with us, and our global coalition is stronger as a result.",

Moscow wanted quite badly to be allied with the west a couple decades ago. Many people have pointed out that allying with Moscow would beat useful way to contain China.

It is clear that currently the Russian forces are not undertaking major offensive operations.

And all was done by the same reconnaissance fire complex probing tactics they're still using. They have been attacking towards Sloviansk since mid April, the waterways from the east through NW make it nearly impossible to take without a dramatic flanking maneuver from the NW, which they're trying to do right now.\n\nThey've been trying to break through the defenses around Avdiivka also since mid April. \n\nThey never got a chance to attack Bakhmut until the Popansa breakthrough occurred, since they got within range they've been attacking since they've had the opportunity.\n\nThe entire eastern defensive line was \n\n>This is clear not just from the fact that they have not been gaining any significant ground, but also based on the fact that the intensity of shelling has dropped several times over and the casualty rate of the Ukrainian forces went from 100 KIA a day to something like 30.\n\nNeither of those are indications of an operational pause. \n\nFirst, if they were in a pause, arty would nearly stop altogether. Also to consider is the month long plus UAF strategic campaign attacking Russian rear area with PGMs, specifically against ammunition supply points holding artillery shells. Guess what happens when those get hit? They can't shoot as much.\n\nSecond, casualties can be less nationwide for a whole lot of reasons besides a non-existent operational pause in Ukraine. For instance, besides less Russian arty firing, the Ukrainians are in better defensive positions in places like the Donbas than they were previously, which was purposely placing themselves in the absolute worst places, reinforcing failure to hold ground regardless of the costs, and then still losing ground. 100-200 KIA didn't just happen, anymore than suffering stings on your dick just happens when you stick it in a hornet's nest; casualties that heavy are caused by bad decisions.\n\nThird, Zelensky is a professional liar, aka politician. Everything he says publicly is part of a sales pitch, it's literally his job. If he talks up casualties, it's to get more weapons. If he talks down casualties, it's because he wants to demonstrate how effective recent weapon acquisitions have been and wants more of them. I'll wait until no shit investigations prove casualties plummeted before everyone cheers. \n\n>Now of course you can argue that this is due to having to reposition the artillery, bring up the supply lines, but it's been 3 weeks already, more than enough time to do all that.\n\nFirst, most of the salient campaign didn't even pause, so let's not get ahead of ourselves.\n\nSecond, the UAF didn't just move a few kilometers west, the entire eastern half of the salient was abandoned, every unit along the Donets or near it like a large reverse C and now to a position that looks like a /, with distances of 30-50 km. \n\nTo put those distances in perspective, Russian artillery is positioned 8-15 km behind the front lines, and those were that far behind the Donets river for the most part. Most had barely moved since early April and suddenly had to not only move their guns but all their ammo too, those massive artillery ASPs at the brigade and division level all had to be picked up and moved. Over bridges that were either destroyed or in need of heavy repair. \n\nAnd that was just the artillery, everything else had to get moved 30-50 km too. Counterbattery radars, drone operation sites, field HQs.\n\nAnd while they're doing that, the ground forces WERE STILL ATTACKING. Over a week ago the Russians attempted a failed coup de main attack to overrun the new Siversk-Bakhmut defensive line before it could be properly manned and supposedly got mauled. So now that means recon recon recon because there is a whole new defensive line they know nothing about.\n\n>Now as far as the Ukrainian offensive operations, I don't believe we have seen a true large scale multi brigade offensive.\n\nFor the Russians in the Donbas, each BTG is part of a brigade that reports to a division HQ that is part of a CAA, with each having their own sector of the overall operational area. They're all coordinated but they're all working separately, with each CAA having its own supply line, its own operational objectives.\n\nAlmost none of them have been doing multi-brigade attacks in the same sector, they're doing company or battalion attacks against focal points so they can mass fires within the division or even CAA areas, every tube or rocket in that sector (plus airstrikes) that can range that target are all supporting that single attack (the principle of massing), often done as a probe. When that company or battalion attack stops, either taking ground or failing, another starts within the division or CAA, etc. And each CAA is doing that independent of each other.\n\nWhen the UAF retreated from the Donets in early July, that only affected a couple CAA. Other CAA weren't affected, they didn't move, their supply lines weren't disrupted (other than the UAF campaign striking their rear area), which is why they didn't stop attacking.",

They have been attacking towards Sloviansk since mid April, the waterways from the east through NW make it nearly impossible to take without a dramatic flanking maneuver from the NW, which they&#39;re trying to do right now.</p>\n\n<p>They&#39;ve been trying to break through the defenses around Avdiivka also since mid April. </p>\n\n<p>They never got a chance to attack Bakhmut until the Popansa breakthrough occurred, since they got within range they&#39;ve been attacking since they&#39;ve had the opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>The entire eastern defensive line was </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is clear not just from the fact that they have not been gaining any significant ground, but also based on the fact that the intensity of shelling has dropped several times over and the casualty rate of the Ukrainian forces went from 100 KIA a day to something like 30.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Neither of those are indications of an operational pause. </p>\n\n<p>First, if they were in a pause, arty would nearly stop altogether. Also to consider is the month long plus UAF strategic campaign attacking Russian rear area with PGMs, specifically against ammunition supply points holding artillery shells. Guess what happens when those get hit? They can&#39;t shoot as much.</p>\n\n<p>Second, casualties can be less nationwide for a whole lot of reasons besides a non-existent operational pause in Ukraine. For instance, besides less Russian arty firing, the Ukrainians are in better defensive positions in places like the Donbas than they were previously, which was purposely placing themselves in the absolute worst places, reinforcing failure to hold ground regardless of the costs, and then still losing ground. 100-200 KIA didn&#39;t just happen, anymore than suffering stings on your dick just happens when you stick it in a hornet&#39;s nest; casualties that heavy are caused by bad decisions.</p>\n\n<p>Third, Zelensky is a professional liar, aka politician. Everything he says publicly is part of a sales pitch, it&#39;s literally his job. If he talks up casualties, it&#39;s to get more weapons. If he talks down casualties, it&#39;s because he wants to demonstrate how effective recent weapon acquisitions have been and wants more of them. I&#39;ll wait until no shit investigations prove casualties plummeted before everyone cheers. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now of course you can argue that this is due to having to reposition the artillery, bring up the supply lines, but it&#39;s been 3 weeks already, more than enough time to do all that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>First, most of the salient campaign didn&#39;t even pause, so let&#39;s not get ahead of ourselves.</p>\n\n<p>Second, the UAF didn&#39;t just move a few kilometers west, the entire eastern half of the salient was abandoned, every unit along the Donets or near it like a large reverse C and now to a position that looks like a /, with distances of 30-50 km. </p>\n\n<p>To put those distances in perspective, Russian artillery is positioned 8-15 km behind the front lines, and those were that far behind the Donets river for the most part. Most had barely moved since early April and suddenly had to not only move their guns but all their ammo too, those massive artillery ASPs at the brigade and division level all had to be picked up and moved. Over bridges that were either destroyed or in need of heavy repair. </p>\n\n<p>And that was just the artillery, everything else had to get moved 30-50 km too. Counterbattery radars, drone operation sites, field HQs.</p>\n\n<p>And while they&#39;re doing that, the ground forces WERE STILL ATTACKING. Over a week ago the Russians attempted a failed coup de main attack to overrun the new Siversk-Bakhmut defensive line before it could be properly manned and supposedly got mauled. So now that means recon recon recon because there is a whole new defensive line they know nothing about.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now as far as the Ukrainian offensive operations, I don&#39;t believe we have seen a true large scale multi brigade offensive.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For the Russians in the Donbas, each BTG is part of a brigade that reports to a division HQ that is part of a CAA, with each having their own sector of the overall operational area. They&#39;re all coordinated but they&#39;re all working separately, with each CAA having its own supply line, its own operational objectives.</p>\n\n<p>Almost none of them have been doing multi-brigade attacks in the same sector, they&#39;re doing company or battalion attacks against focal points so they can mass fires within the division or even CAA areas, every tube or rocket in that sector (plus airstrikes) that can range that target are all supporting that single attack (the principle of massing), often done as a probe. When that company or battalion attack stops, either taking ground or failing, another starts within the division or CAA, etc. And each CAA is doing that independent of each other.</p>\n\n<p>When the UAF retreated from the Donets in early July, that only affected a couple CAA. Other CAA weren&#39;t affected, they didn&#39;t move, their supply lines weren&#39;t disrupted (other than the UAF campaign striking their rear area), which is why they didn&#39;t stop attacking.</p>\n</div>",

Those are still fairly heavy, and considerably pricier and more complicated to operate, and can't be air-transported that easily.\n\nFor example, we might start to see more examples of, say, [this sort of system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqYB7cGij6o) which amounts to a mobile, open carrier with an artillery piece slapped on it.
