Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

The ultimate goal for Russia is to reintegrate these breakaway regions. In the context of Ukraine, my viewpoint aligns with [Mearsheimer's arguments in his 1992 article about Russia, Ukraine & nukes](https://old.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/168v7by/credibledefense_daily_megathread_september_03_2023/jz1cd5o/).\n\nI believe that Putin's motivation for the invasion was a growing concern that Ukraine was nearing a point of irreversible independence, making its return to Russia an almost insurmountable challenge. Thus, for Putin, the window to annex Ukraine was rapidly closing.\n\nThis is absolutely in direct contradiction to what post-Valdai Club Mearsheimer argues. He's repeatedly asserted that Putin lacks territorial ambitions and has no desire to annex Ukraine. According to him, Putin's primary concern is the prospect of a hostile military alliance (NATO) on Russia's borders, which could potentially enable NATO to invade Russia. I firmly disagree with this perspective.

Such an outcome might indeed signify an existential threat, as it suggests Russia losing territory\u2014even if this land is technically in Ukraine and not within the internationally recognized borders of post-1991 Russia. Historically, territorial loss is often deemed an existential threat to nation-states. However, while Putin might see former Soviet Republics as territories to reclaim for Russia, I argue there are varying degrees of existential threats. Being unable to annex regions that have long been independent and have evolved into nation-states does not constitute an existential threat.\n\nTo conclude, while I acknowledge the validity in your argument (allowing states to define their existential threats), Mearsheimer appears to superimpose his interpretations on Russia: the presence of NATO on Russia's borders. He seems to overlook what might be Russia's genuine existential concern: the potential loss of what it views as its 'rightful' territory in Ukraine.

In my opinion, the Mearsheimer of 2015-2023 misinterprets Russia's objectives, contradicting his own assertions in his 1992 article.\n\nYou'll have to be specific, in broad strokes I disagree. The issue is that you're comparing the realist analysis from the 1992 article that is mainly focused on the Ukrainian POV, and then comparing it to the realist analysis of modern Mearsheimer which is mostly focused on the Russian POV(probably because it gets Mearsheimer around, his 2014 lecture is what really catapulted him into 'fame' after all). He will sometimes make comments from the Ukrainian POV, and those are completely in line with his 1992 thinking.\n\n>He seems to overlook what might be Russia's genuine existential concern: the potential loss of what it views as its 'rightful' territory in Ukraine.\n\nWell one of Mearsheimer's claims is that if Russia's invasion is merely about a landgrab / securing territory; then the possibility of diplomacy and making a deal with Putin / Russia is there. On the other hand, if the issue(whatever exactly it might be) is instead existential by itself then no such diplomacy will occur and there will be no end to the conflict. \n\nI find that argument quite persuasive, though the issue is there always of where you begin and where you end. And just to be clear, I do think modern Russia as it pertains to the mainstream regime is a revanchist entity, I have made comparisons to Serbia in the context of the dissolution of Yugoslavia; the parallels are very similar. Whenever the imperial center loses power, it tends to lash out in some way; to reclaim past glory. But just because there are imperial tendencies, does not mean that *some* grievances that have been presented by the Russian side are illegitimate. When Gorbachev made the intention to align Russia and west in the same security arrangement, that was a once in a lifetime opportunity that should've been pursued. Instead, he was rebuked; and the seeds of resentment were sown, that lead to the rise of revanchist nationalists. Most of these decisions were not made intentionally, there was also a lot of bad luck and historic happenstance; putting all the blame on Russia is wrong.",

He will sometimes make comments from the Ukrainian POV, and those are completely in line with his 1992 thinking.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>He seems to overlook what might be Russia&#39;s genuine existential concern: the potential loss of what it views as its &#39;rightful&#39; territory in Ukraine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Well one of Mearsheimer&#39;s claims is that if Russia&#39;s invasion is merely about a landgrab / securing territory; then the possibility of diplomacy and making a deal with Putin / Russia is there. On the other hand, if the issue(whatever exactly it might be) is instead existential by itself then no such diplomacy will occur and there will be no end to the conflict. </p>\n\n<p>I find that argument quite persuasive, though the issue is there always of where you begin and where you end. And just to be clear, I do think modern Russia as it pertains to the mainstream regime is a revanchist entity, I have made comparisons to Serbia in the context of the dissolution of Yugoslavia; the parallels are very similar. Whenever the imperial center loses power, it tends to lash out in some way; to reclaim past glory. But just because there are imperial tendencies, does not mean that <em>some</em> grievances that have been presented by the Russian side are illegitimate. When Gorbachev made the intention to align Russia and west in the same security arrangement, that was a once in a lifetime opportunity that should&#39;ve been pursued. Instead, he was rebuked; and the seeds of resentment were sown, that lead to the rise of revanchist nationalists. Most of these decisions were not made intentionally, there was also a lot of bad luck and historic happenstance; putting all the blame on Russia is wrong.</p>\n</div>",

The United States didn't pay much attention to Russian complaints about NATO expansion, withdrawal from the ABM Treaty, and so forth and so on, but we did not have a confrontational policy until the Ukraine crisis broke out in 2014.

When practical, scientific views are expressed, usually it is the right wing folks who lose their lunches. See global climate science ( no citation needed) or in this case human biology. \n\nAn overwhelming percentage of abortions are done in the first trimester, less in the second, and the very few in the third happen almost always when the mother's life is in peril, or the fetus is non-viable (won't survive or will for an hour in misery).

There are two points to be made in response.\n\n1) Abortion is the intentional and unjust killing an unborn human being. Nobody has the right to unjustly kill another human being on demand. One cannot simply brush over this right - even when bodily rights come into conflict with the right to life, we look for a least-harm resolution.  \n\nFor instance, we often do not allow free exercise of bodily rights in cases such as preventing suicide attempts & locking at-risk patients up until they are no longer considered at risk, illegalizing certain harmful drug usage, mandatory autopsies if the coroner deems it to be in the public interest, and more.

You might as well suggest that the stomach digesting food without your permission is violating you.\n\nSomeone force-feeding you would be violating your rights.  The food being digested does not. The child has no capacity to take action because the child only starts to exist as part of the natural bodily processes of the woman - that is entirely in the purview of the man and woman.\n\n>You can believe that abortion is murder if you like, however the creation of a fetus in a woman's womb is her responsibility to continue and hers to end.\n\nThis means nothing.

To argue otherwise is to deny human rights and replace them with some conceptual arbitrary privilege.\n\n2) An unborn child is definitively a living human being.\n\n3) This most fundamental right is the right to life - that is, the right not to be unjustly killed - without which, no other rights can exist. \n\n4) Abortion intentionally kills an innocent human being.

And, last but not least, it might make it much more difficult, if not impossible, to secure the Russian Duma's ratification of the Start II agreement and to achieve further reductions of nuclear weaponry.\n\nBaker in 2002:\n\n>One sad lesson of the twentieth century is that refusing to form alliances with defeated adversaries is more dangerous than forming such alliances. The Treaty of Versailles solved the \"German problem\" in exactly the wrong way\u2014 by sealing the defeat with territorial and economic retribution. This resolution certainly demoralized Germany in the immediate aftermath of war, but the resulting grievances fueled something unimaginably worse and more dangerous. One hesitates to stretch historical analogies too far, but little imagination is required to see something similar happening in Russia. The end of the Cold War was certainly not settled by anything like Versailles, but from Russia's perspective, the results have been much the same\u2014a humiliating loss of territory, prestige, and power. Russia's economic and political problems have stemmed largely from Russia's own failure to implement the necessary reforms to encourage the creation of a market economy, but it would not be difficult\u2014indeed, it has not been difficult\u2014for Russian demagogues to blame the West for the troubles ordinary Russian men and women have experienced during the past decade.

By continuing to treat Russia like a potential adversary, we may encourage it to become our enemy, the very thing we fear. The best way to find an enemy is to look for one, and I worry that that is what we are doing when we try to isolate Russia. The same principle would apply, of course, if we were to embark on a policy to try to isolate China.\n\nThe issue is really that after USSR collapsed, Russia was not given any assistance that could be compared to the Marshall plan or even something what Yugoslavia enjoyed. In both of those cases USA was at the forefront of financial assistance, but the assistance was predicated on the recipient implementing political and economic reforms that would foster democracy. And it is quite obvious why this didn't occur, because Russia was still considered a great power and by extension a rival *and* because the political climate at the time was high on the concept of liberal democracy. \n\nI think it's interesting that USSR more or less peacefully collapsed given the scale of its empire, but that relatively peaceful dissolution did not procure anything good for Russia. The comparison to China is interesting, because China on the other hand never abandoned communism(even if it did so in some practical terms), it is still today a 'communist' state that resisted liberal democracy. And the prize for that resistance is the whole of west moving all its production to China and investing heavily into the country.\n\nI also think it's worth talking about Putin, since leaders matter. If you read his speeches from the time when he takes power to around ~2003 they are starkly different than afterwards, especially after the infamous Munich speech. How does one explain the complete change in tone? During this time one can easily argue that Putin is also at his weakest, he is seen as being too soft and a moderate. Again, the change in tone either requires one to think that Putin started plotting in 1999 already and he worked on his plan to backstab west for 20 years+, or that simply the change in tone was genuine. \n\nThe role of imperialism and revanchism is of course deeply relevant here. I think an interesting comparison is between USSR/Yugoslavia and Russia/Serbia. Both states held the highest amount of power within their federations, and when they dissolved they lost the most power, resources, etc. In Serbia's case, the rise of nationalist and imperialist rhetoric coincided with the weakening of the central authority apparatus of the party. Between the rise of nationalist rhetoric and the first imperialist actions that were then undertaken, there was about 20 years. About the same time as in Russia's case. The big difference is that Yugoslavia was a failing state where most people knew that the only thing keeping it together is Tito, in USSR's case; its dissolution came shockingly fast and was not predicted by many people. So that basically explains why one state acted much 'sooner' when the imperial center lost its power. The other big difference is that one had nukes, which is why you actually had the west acting in a way that wanted to *preserve* the federation. (let us remember the infamous Chicken Kyiv speech).

Political landscape also can't really be compared at all. The only country that really fits the bill here is Poland...and they definitely received a ton of help with their reforms; but most importantly they received a shitton of investment, especially from Germany. They're basically the proxy arm of the German manufacturing complex.\n>Russia definitely did receive some aid: I lived in Moscow and my seat st school was next to a window snd right outside was a streetlamp with \"US AID\" written on it.

The commission of this offence by a group of persons is punishable by seven to 12 years&#39; imprisonment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So if they get caught, they plead ignorance and don&#39;t get prosecuted. Or conversely</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>According to documents obtained by RFE/RL, the district police concluded that the suspects in the kidnapping case were not &quot;subject to criminal liability&quot; because they &quot;voluntarily decided to abandon their intended act [of kidnapping].&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They get caught, and say they don&#39;t want to kidnap them anymore, and so get let off.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s not really strange that prosecutions are low if the successful defense after getting caught is &quot;I didn&#39;t know, and if I did know, I don&#39;t want to do it anymore.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Like imagine if stealing was the same defense. &quot;I didn&#39;t know stealing was a car was a crime, and here&#39;s the car back.&quot; And they just let them off the hook with a promise to not do it again.</p>\n</div>",

The charge for just the birth was 80k. That doesn't include all the doctor visits my wife had or the medication to keep her blood pressure under control during the pregnancy to keep her from having eclampsia. It also doesn't count the extra week we had in the hospital afterwards, or the tests after my daughter was born, or all the routine doctor's visits in the first year. I have great insurance through my work so it was basically all covered, except one doctor visit where they coded it wrong and so they want to charge me $700 for it. Been fighting that for over a year now.  So it easily would've cost us $100k to have my daughter.\n\nNow let's talk about childcare. I've again we're lucky. My wife's work offers 3 months paternity leave, so she has time to rest and heal from her 2nd degree tear. Thank goodness she didn't need a C-section. I was able to use my massive amounts of banked sick time to be with her for a month after the birth to help, and flex working from home. After those three months, my wife returned to work but she works from home so she can stay with our daughter. We looked into daycare and it would cost us $2k a month, if we could get a spot. You know what the median household income is in my area? $63k. So childcare for one would cost 1/3rd the median household income. \n\nThe other big expense is housing. My mortgage is $1,500 a month; Median rent in my area is $1,400. Using rent as the lower amount, that would be another $16,800 a year. \nSo between housing and childcare costs it would be $42k a year. That's 2/3rds of that median household income of $63k, and before anything else like food, transportation, or utilities. \n\nYou're whole \"Americans don't care about family but like luxury\" theory just doesn't play out because Americans are not living in luxury right now. \n\nYou know what the difference between hard economic times before and now is? Women enfranchisement.

                        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>This is completely the opposite experience I&#39;ve had, my friends have had, and wonder where you came up with it.  </p>\n\n<p>I had my daughter a year and a half ago. The charge for just the birth was 80k. That doesn&#39;t include all the doctor visits my wife had or the medication to keep her blood pressure under control during the pregnancy to keep her from having eclampsia. It also doesn&#39;t count the extra week we had in the hospital afterwards, or the tests after my daughter was born, or all the routine doctor&#39;s visits in the first year. I have great insurance through my work so it was basically all covered, except one doctor visit where they coded it wrong and so they want to charge me $700 for it. Been fighting that for over a year now.  So it easily would&#39;ve cost us $100k to have my daughter.</p>\n\n<p>Now let&#39;s talk about childcare. I&#39;ve again we&#39;re lucky. My wife&#39;s work offers 3 months paternity leave, so she has time to rest and heal from her 2nd degree tear. Thank goodness she didn&#39;t need a C-section. I was able to use my massive amounts of banked sick time to be with her for a month after the birth to help, and flex working from home. After those three months, my wife returned to work but she works from home so she can stay with our daughter. We looked into daycare and it would cost us $2k a month, if we could get a spot. You know what the median household income is in my area? $63k. So childcare for one would cost 1/3rd the median household income. </p>\n\n<p>The other big expense is housing. My mortgage is $1,500 a month; Median rent in my area is $1,400. Using rent as the lower amount, that would be another $16,800 a year. \nSo between housing and childcare costs it would be $42k a year. That&#39;s 2/3rds of that median household income of $63k, and before anything else like food, transportation, or utilities. </p>\n\n<p>You&#39;re whole &quot;Americans don&#39;t care about family but like luxury&quot; theory just doesn&#39;t play out because Americans are not living in luxury right now. </p>\n\n<p>You know what the difference between hard economic times before and now is? Women enfranchisement. When women have easy access to birth control, are not discriminated against getting an education, and are allowed to have their own bank accounts not tied to make relatives/spouses, they have less children and later since their only options aren&#39;t getting married (with little chance of divorce), have kids, and raise them.

The two sides are now at parity, a source close to Ukraine\u2019s commander-in-chief says. New electronic-warfare jamming boxes, fitted on tanks and other assets, are meanwhile reducing the ability of Ukraine\u2019s first-person-view drones to guide payloads into the most vulnerable sections of a target. A source within Ukraine\u2019s general staff suggests any technological advantage his country once enjoyed was necessarily temporary. Both sides are learning from the other, he says, and reverse engineering is getting quicker: \u201cWe had the experience of defending against Russian drones, and we got better quickly.

        "body": "I wanted to bring up a few clarifications about the AMRAAM/missile development discussion from yesterday.\n\nFirst, I think the main source of confusion was that I come from an engineering perspective, while Fox is essentially our \"customer\". If he's the guy on the other end of the table in customer meetings, then *of course* 'development' is going to take a decade. That is indeed what happened with the AIM-120D development: Fox looks at it from initial contract award to initial operating capacity. In other words, from when the money first gets appropriated to when fighters are equipped en masse with the new variant. For the -120D, this was 11 years.\n\nTo further clarify, this was stated:\n\n>the AIM-120 itself took over a decade of development\n\nWith initial funding approved January 2004 and IOC in 2015, this is accurate. However, the same document (the acquisitions document mentioned in u/Original_History_562 's excellent rebuttal yesterday) shows the timeline from funding to CDR (critical design review, which is for most intents and purposes the \"end of development\" to someone like me) was two years: January 2004 to November 2005. That's a mighty fast turnaround! ... But it should be reiterated that these are *goals*. Not actuals.\n\nNow, why did the AIM-120D languish in purgatory for over a decade? Personally, I don't know. I get the impression it simply wasn't a priority with the GWOT forcing defense to focus on products related to COIN. But I want to reiterate that this turnaround is *not usual* for missiles in general, though A2A missiles do seem uniquely prone to development hell. \n\nNow, as to the source of my claim that \"testing had concluded\": I used this source, which is generally credible: http://www.fi-aeroweb.com/Defense/AMRAAM.html\n\nFrom that source, we get:\n\n>Production of the AIM-120D commenced in 2006 with the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase completed in September 2009. \n\nFirst let's clarify what an EMD phase is. Per the Air Force (https://aaf.dau.edu/aaf/mca/emd-phase/#:~:text=The%20purpose%20of%20the%20EMD,production%2C%20deployment%20and%20sustainment%20decisions.):\n\n>The purpose of the EMD phase is to develop, build, test, and evaluate a materiel solution to verify that all operational and implied requirements, including those for security, have been met, and to support production, deployment and sustainment decisions.\n\nSo, seems that testing concluded after about five years from contract award to end of testing, with most engineering development work having taken place during three years. This lines up with my initial statement that it wouldn't be impossible to ram through the next-gen AMRAAM in that timeframe. It'd be tight, but understand my perspective: Raytheon is about to have its AMRAAM severely reduced in importance to the US military because of the development of Lockheed's JATM, which is intended to functionally replace it. They would very much like to find a niche for further development. AMRAAM-AXE isn't even a new missile: It's an A2A adaptation of the AMRAAM-ER, which is a GBAD adaptation. Most of the engineering work for the missile is complete. I'd expect a faster turnaround for this adaptation than the ten years Fox was talking about.\n\nNow, about the point of that part of the post. I wasn't suggesting Ukraine is due to receive the AMRAAM-AXE. Fox is right to point out that it's not even approved for funding yet. I simply speculated that they could be a recipient of them as an alternative to the JATM, which they'd be unlikely to receive.\n\nNow, to switch gears and briefly discuss AMRAAM D. Fox's initial statement was that I was incorrectly extrapolating the variant from the article. The source of the article was one I found simply because it quoted a Ukrainian official whose quote I saw. I wasn't interested in any other part of the article. What jumped out to me was the comment that the range of the missile provided would be 160-180 km. That is only possible with the AIM-120D, or as it was previously called, the AIM-120C-8. Perhaps the C-8 is an export classification. It may be slightly more robust in some ways. Functionally, the missiles might as well be identical. Shoot me.\n\nFinally: Why was Fox blocked? Not because he 'provided sources', or disagreed with me. I've been wrong many times before, and have accepted corrections when properly sources. But no: It's because the first thing I read on his post was this:\n\n>seriously people, this dude is making shit up.\n\nAnd:\n\n>The guy is literally posting false shit, but you guys are seriously eating it up? The Selected Acquisition Report literally is telling everyone this dude is a liar. \n\nI didnt read a single word after that. The moment you stoop to ad hominems, you get blocked. That's true of every person I've blocked so far- I believe only three or four people. The second you're so high on your own supply that you call me a *liar* rather than attempting to calmly correct a misunderstanding or get to the bottom of a disagreement, that's when I no longer wish to see anything you have to say.\n\nSo with that stated, I believe my perspective is correct, though it's true I was woefully inadequate in fully explaining it. Yesterday was a busy day, and I didn't want to go too far into the debate as it wasn't something I considered particularly important. Half of it was speculation on an hypothetical future where the conflict is still ongoing in a deliberately vague \"few years\". The other half seemed pretty obvious to me. For some reason, this triggered Fox's rant. Well, so be it. Now hopefully my perspective is clear, and the root of the disagreement is now more understood.",
