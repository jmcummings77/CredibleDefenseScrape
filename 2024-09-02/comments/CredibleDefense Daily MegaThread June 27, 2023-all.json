But it's only worth it as a feint because it's somewhat credible.\n\nStrategically Ukraine has not committed to any axis of advance in order to keep the Russians on their feet. The more Russia \"calls the bluff\" of this action by not responding in force, the easier it becomes to expand the bridgehead without a fixed link to support it logistically. After all how much ammunition and fuel you need is largely dependent on how aggressivly your enemy responds. \n\nOnce you have a sizable bridgehead, it's not like the river cannot be bridged.

        "body": "I saw that u/Draskla posted a summary on Tagarev's statement today.\n\nI would like to point out a few things in regards to it and a few tangential subjects.\n\nToday Tagarev had a rather long TV interview today, I won't post it here because I don't think it has subtitles.\n\nAnyway, the important things are the following.\n\n1. He expressed that the \"value\" of the equipment is difficult to calculate because it is of articles bought long ago (ie soviet).\n2. He further expressed that \"resource\" (read shelf life) is nearing its end (he said couple of years) and the government will have to destroy them either way - My personal opinion is that while this is probably true, it has been explicitly stated to calm down the more \"neutral\" part of the population which might go on to question if we can afford to spare the (presumably) ammo.\n3. Tagarev went on to say that the ratio of aid/weapons is weighed more towards ammo/weapons than aid than the previous (Bulgarian) package for Ukraine.\n4. Most importantly, he did say that the package contains (among other things) ammo and **systems**. If I recall correctly this has never been said before, because (although the contents of all packages have been secret) previous direct packages did not contain heavy weapons (tanks,artillery, etc.). He further went on to say that some of the \"systems\" are old, which is generally true for vast majority of BG equipment.\n\nThis is purely speculation on my part but I suspect some AD equipment (other than MANPADS) will be delivered. Bulgarian armed forces still have on inventory (and supposedly in usable state) S125 and S75 and some more \"modern\" AD systems.\n\nAlthough BG does have S300, it is extremely unlikely to be sent and since it has been in the public discourse (mainly as irreplaceable and essential asset) essentially out of the question.\n\nIn regards to the warehouse explosions, Tagarev did mention he suspected Russia. I believe he explicitly named it, but haven't checked it again before writing the comment.EDIT: He did not expressly say it was Russia but strongly suggests it in a \"political\" way.\n\nHowever in the past decade there have been more than 10 fires and \"accidents\" at different weapon warehouses. There even was a Novichock poisoning attempt at Gebrev (owner of weapon/ammo production facilities) but he survived. His warehouse in Chechia also \"caught fire\".\n\nIn that regard, the Chech authorities managed to name (I believe) two GRU agents that were, at the time of both Bulgarian \"accidents\" and the one in Czechia, in each country. However, the Bulgarian prosecution has not done anything to investigate the matter. I, however would like to stress that this has nothing to do with keeping the tensions down as some users here have expressed such opinion.\n\nThe BG judicial system as a whole is very compromised and not really independent. The prosecution is essentially a state within the state and at least two political parties have a lot of authority outside of the normal political system (read, deal with power with local Oligarchs and other powerful structures within the state).\n\nAnother thing which I would like to mention is that the president, while techicaly \"NATO trained general\" is very much product of last regime, before '89. He has graduated as an officer of the air forces in '87 and in those times, only very loyal to the ideology (or rather the regime) people could even hope to get accepted in military academies as the one he has graduated.\n\nWhile he has seen \"the light\" in that a lot more power (and money) can be gained through capitalism he has always been sympathetic to Russia, avoiding answering direct question even when Russia named Bulgaria a hostile state. He further (along with two \"pro-peace\" political parties) has stated that providing weapons to Ukraine only prolongs the bloodshed and the war. Further, he has stated (essentially every time Bulgarian weapon aid to Ukraine is the subject) that this could or would \"drag Bulgaria into the conflict\", yet not mentioning this can only happen if Russia attacked Bulgaria.\n\nThe president was virtually in power for almost a year since the parties could not form a government (and the constitution states the president assigns a caretaker government until next elections which are usually scheduled in to happen in 2-3 months).\n\nHis government(s) essentially followed \"neutrality\" position, where it made everything possible to not send any actual aid to Ukraine, particularly of military kind but dared no try to stop the \"triangle deal\" where military production is bought by allied states and kindly enough did not care what happened later.\n\n\"His\" government did not expressed interest in participating in the NATO deal for 1m shells for Ukraine. In regards to that deal, Tagarev mentions in his interview that the (president's) government did not participate even though one of the ways to participate was to receive funding to increase production capacity, which obviously directly benefits Bulgaria rather than anyone else.\n\nTagarev mentions that the government is preparing a request to participate in the NATO deal to receive the aforementioned funding to increase production capacity, but did not go into details. He mentions specifically 155mm shells production.\n\nOn the domestic front, while Bulgaria is on its way out of the political crisis, the government in on VERY shaky legs. This comment will turn into a 30 page essay if I try to summarize why. It is entirely possible government won't last past this autumn and certainly won't survive till 2025 (much less its actual end of mandate in 2027).\n\nI will add more in EDIT if I find to have missed something.   \n\n\nPS: Tagarev did mention that Bulgaria will be financially compensated for this aid. Whether he meant financially in the pure sense as in be paid, or get a discount for replacement did not became clear.\n\nHe also stated that Bulgaria may provide training facilities for Ukrainian servicemen, but did not specify for what kind of personnel in particular. In the past there was an initiative to train either 30 or 60 Ukrainian military medical staff at a time.\n\nTagarev also mentions the presiden't numerous statements that \"Bulgaria can be dragged into the conflict\" by saying there are no logical arguments and suggests journalist to ask the president how will this happen since there are more than 30 other countries providing aid, mentioning that there are countries even closer (mentioning Estonia in particular).\n\nHe goes on further to state that helping Ukraine outright win actually increases security as any peace treaty now will likely just embolden Russia in the future.\n\nTagarev also expresses the view (which is objectively true) that there is a significant media campaign to disrupt the government (and army) attempt to supply weapons to Ukraine.\n\nHe mentions that some parties (as in political) push the Kremlin interests (his exact words) and the claim (of those parties) that Bulgaria is going to send its own soldiers to Ukraine (which is of course absurd claim, but works to stoke fears in the less informed and ignorant part of the population).\n\nWhen asked about the whole Wagner fiasco, he doesn't say anything of particular value but also the Bulgaria is neutral in that particular conflict and follows the events to try and help its own citizen that might be in danger or require assistance.\n\nHe expresses the view that Lukashenko is only a puppet between Putin and Prigozhin, and is only used to hide how the actual deal has been made.\n\nWhen asked about receiving western equipment is exchange of donating soviet one, he says that the focus is elsewhere now (ie, that ship has sailed more or less) and mentions \"coalition f16\", something this sub is well aware of.  He says there is \"some interest\" in a few particular systems in exchange of which Bulgaria can be \"compensated\", he however mentions that those are \"main battle systems\" which he doesn't go into much detail but says \"essentially aircraft, tanks and/or SAM systems\"   (which goes against my own speculation, although here it might be in the sense of the more modern ones SA-6, SA-8, etc.).\n\nThe rest of the interview is about the future Bulgarian F16 which have been delayed and isn't of particular interest in regards to Ukraine.",

In the past there was an initiative to train either 30 or 60 Ukrainian military medical staff at a time.</p>\n\n<p>Tagarev also mentions the presiden&#39;t numerous statements that &quot;Bulgaria can be dragged into the conflict&quot; by saying there are no logical arguments and suggests journalist to ask the president how will this happen since there are more than 30 other countries providing aid, mentioning that there are countries even closer (mentioning Estonia in particular).</p>\n\n<p>He goes on further to state that helping Ukraine outright win actually increases security as any peace treaty now will likely just embolden Russia in the future.</p>\n\n<p>Tagarev also expresses the view (which is objectively true) that there is a significant media campaign to disrupt the government (and army) attempt to supply weapons to Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>He mentions that some parties (as in political) push the Kremlin interests (his exact words) and the claim (of those parties) that Bulgaria is going to send its own soldiers to Ukraine (which is of course absurd claim, but works to stoke fears in the less informed and ignorant part of the population).</p>\n\n<p>When asked about the whole Wagner fiasco, he doesn&#39;t say anything of particular value but also the Bulgaria is neutral in that particular conflict and follows the events to try and help its own citizen that might be in danger or require assistance.</p>\n\n<p>He expresses the view that Lukashenko is only a puppet between Putin and Prigozhin, and is only used to hide how the actual deal has been made.</p>\n\n<p>When asked about receiving western equipment is exchange of donating soviet one, he says that the focus is elsewhere now (ie, that ship has sailed more or less) and mentions &quot;coalition f16&quot;, something this sub is well aware of.  He says there is &quot;some interest&quot; in a few particular systems in exchange of which Bulgaria can be &quot;compensated&quot;, he however mentions that those are &quot;main battle systems&quot; which he doesn&#39;t go into much detail but says &quot;essentially aircraft, tanks and/or SAM systems&quot;   (which goes against my own speculation, although here it might be in the sense of the more modern ones SA-6, SA-8, etc.).</p>\n\n<p>The rest of the interview is about the future Bulgarian F16 which have been delayed and isn&#39;t of particular interest in regards to Ukraine.</p>\n</div>",

The 24th Brigade did its best but the momentum at that time was really too favorable to the Russians. After losing the town the Ukrainians managed to establish new lines of defense north of the town and hold them for about a month while the battle raged in Severodonetsk.\n\nIn my view, May/June 2022 was arguably the nadir of Ukrainian perfomance. Russia had recovered from the madness of the first weeks \nand had started a more \"coherent\" war, including fielding enormous firepower in terms of artillery (about 60k shells/day). In the Siversky Donets sector they deployed the vast majority of the formations of the Western and Central Military Districts, elements of the 76th VDV Division and LPR units - whose press-ganged troops were numerous and still relatively fresh and were considered (and thereby employed) basically halfway between today's Russian mobilized soldiers and the convicts of Storm Z units. Moreover, PMC Wagner's action was instrumental in the urban battle at Popasna.\n\nThe Ukrainian Army was in a limbo in which Soviet-made armament stocks were beginning to run seriously low, NATO countries were just starting to send in heavy artillery, they did not have GMLRS and Soviet-caliber ammunition factories in the former Warsaw Pact countries had yet to begin to go into full swing. If I am not mistaken, they even used tanks as artillery in several instances, which caused a shortage of 125mm shells. The vast majority of the new brigades created after general mobilization had yet to be fully equipped and the volunteers/conscripts trained. And several of those that had been deployed suffered serious efficiency/discipline issues: e.g. the 115th Mechanized Brigade in Severodonetsk (which the Russians tried to depict as the 115th TD Brigade which wasn't deployed there - I suggest reading this very interesting [article](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/articles/2022/06/15/7352535/), by the way). According to Ukrainian sources, the daily average of KIAs in those weeks was about 200 (which I am convinced was the worst figure of the entire war) and as a result many units suffered huge problems in terms of operational capabilities. Since July/August it was definitely noticeable that the tide had turned for the better.\n\nIn the specific case at Popasna, the UAF did its utmost duty, but it was over-stretched in the wider sector and without actual rotation capabilities. Some units had been deployed along the Siversky Donets to avoid bridgeheads (with great success: Bilohorivka!) After losing Kreminna it would have been better to leave Rubizhne and Severodonetsk, focus on holding the southern sector of the river and entrench around the Oskil river to the north.\n\nThe real breakthrough I recall occurred the following month at Zolote/Hirske. According to pro-Ukrainian sources 4 battalions came very close to being surrounded, although fortunately they were able to retreat in good order. The loss of these strongholds caused the fall of Lysychansk the following week. The rest then is well-known history. In any case, the Ukrainian actions were heroic and miraculous. I remember vividly that after the fall of Lysychansk it was thought that Siversk (also Soledar and Bakhmut) would fall in a short time and basically the town's task was to slow the Russian onslaught towards the Sloviansk/Kramatorsk conurbation, with the Russians taking Sviatohirsk in June in the Oskil sector as well. Instead, Siversk has always remained firmly in Ukrainian hands, and Russia has totally lost momentum ever since and failed to exploit the new operational depth.",

It's like them both using automatic grenade launchers indirectly too, whereas among, say, US forces the Army has no idea how to do that with the Mk-19 and the Marines only really teach it briefly as theoretical.\n\n>In the specific case at Popasna, the UAF did its utmost duty, but it was over-stretched in the wider sector and without actual rotation capabilities.\n\nMy contention is that problem was self-inflicted. By order of the political leaders and top brass (and not the fault of the tactical units) the UAF were not concentrating forces in the areas that needed it. They were deliberately leaving sectors weak despite being to the Russian main effort, in order to use excess combat power in less important areas.\n\nMost of all, they were galavanting across the Donets looking to turn Severodonetsk into Mariupol 2.0 to attrit the Russians, which blew up in their faces. That was just an absolute terrible decision from start to finish. \n\nNot as bad but still wasteful was using the 93rd for months turning a quiet sector west of Izyum hot by counterattacking again and again. I remember at the time wondering why that kept happening. Yeah. I get the idea of a fixing attack, but maybe that mech brigade might be better used somewhere else not doing harassment raids on the Russian lines. \n\nAnd of course the big efforts in Kharkiv and Kherson. I'm not even opposed to them, I'm of mixed feeling.

It&#39;s like them both using automatic grenade launchers indirectly too, whereas among, say, US forces the Army has no idea how to do that with the Mk-19 and the Marines only really teach it briefly as theoretical.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the specific case at Popasna, the UAF did its utmost duty, but it was over-stretched in the wider sector and without actual rotation capabilities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My contention is that problem was self-inflicted. By order of the political leaders and top brass (and not the fault of the tactical units) the UAF were not concentrating forces in the areas that needed it. They were deliberately leaving sectors weak despite being to the Russian main effort, in order to use excess combat power in less important areas.</p>\n\n<p>Most of all, they were galavanting across the Donets looking to turn Severodonetsk into Mariupol 2.0 to attrit the Russians, which blew up in their faces. That was just an absolute terrible decision from start to finish. </p>\n\n<p>Not as bad but still wasteful was using the 93rd for months turning a quiet sector west of Izyum hot by counterattacking again and again. I remember at the time wondering why that kept happening. Yeah. I get the idea of a fixing attack, but maybe that mech brigade might be better used somewhere else not doing harassment raids on the Russian lines. </p>\n\n<p>And of course the big efforts in Kharkiv and Kherson.

Either way, what blows my mind is two rump brigades, barely enough for a single brigade, needed Zelensky to get involved in the decision making process. WTF?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Generally, at least to my understanding, urban warfare is not a good way to get a good ratio of inflicted vs suffered losses \n\nIt really depends. At the end of the day, urban terrain is just ground that is often two stories or higher than surface (so having lots of high ground), tons of defilade, lots of concealment to match lots of cover, with channelized avenues of approach, etc. A good defender facing off against a poor enemy can use the urban terrain as a significant force multiplier. \n\nBut if the enemy uses caution (which the Russians actually did, I was very surprised in their deliberate efforts in Mariupol, the US learned those lessons in blood in places like Fallujah), and using very heavy fires then yes, defending can be a losing proposition in casualties. \n\nEspecially in places like Severondonestk where the fight started with the city already surrounded by three sides, giving three directions for the Russians to attack and making the Ukrainians curve their defensive line on the outskirts, making it 3x longer than it should have been if their flanks were secure. That was a TERRIBLE situation just to start the battle, its no wonder it went to shit so quick (the UAF fell back to the western edge within 4 days of the start of the actual assault, later retaking part of lost ground in counterattacks but then losing that again shortly thereafter).  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The matter in Bakhmut was even more complicated, I agree with Kuleba when he said that either they fought there or they would face the Wagner onslaught with the tens of thousands of convicts somewhere else.\n\nI dont agree with that take at all. Its not as bad as the \"it takes less casualties to defend than to attack and retake it,\" an argument Zelensky and some of the top generals routinely have made in the past that is just nonsense. But I still think this talking point doesn't stand up to scrutiny.  \n\nThe decision to reinforce Bakhmut and not retreat despite the major threat to their flanks and supply lines was made in late February and early March. The mud season ends \\~mid May, leaving \\~2.5 months tops until it UAF offensive time. After that its too dangerous for Wagner to remain on the offensive, they need to wrap it up and consolidate the lines or else they're VERY vulnerable to a large counterattack (Priggy publicly warned against that threat many times, because its real).  \n\nHad the Ukrainians retreated to high ground to the west in late February, the smart move for Wagner would be to follow them and keep attacking, hoping to get the canal and high ground of the ridge and be in a terrific position to launch a follow on attack on Sloviansk and Kramatorsk some time in the future, or use the terrain to their advantage defending in the upcoming UAF offensive. But let's say they did as Kuleba and many others have said and shifted to somewhere else. \n\nIf Wagner was immediately pulled out and sent to another sector like Avdiivka (the next worst UAF position) it would have taken weeks just to move them (hundreds of kilometers, with all their personnel, equipment, supplies, etc), possibly over a month (moving a corps sized force who have been largely sedentary at the upper tactical level since August 2022 is no easy task). Upon getting to wherever they go they need to stage, time for combat forces to acclimatize to that locale, start getting a feel for the area, doing recon and probes, develop TTPs specific to that area and the tactical conditions which will obviously be different than Bakhmut, etc.. By the time they kick off the attack in a serious manner its probably early to mid April, and wow, the clock is TICKING. \n\nAnd then what? Wagner has maybe a month and a half to attack, if that, before they need to wrap things up because the threat of the upcoming UAF offensive. But where ever they end up, Avdiivka, Kremmina, etc, they wouldn't be attacking from a advantageous positions, like high ground overlooking the enemy's tactical rear and supply lines. The Ukrainians on the front lines wouldn't be starved of ammo due to heavily interdicted supply line, with mortarmen down to a handful of rounds a day (only due to local supply issues), or have problems evacuating their casualties which is a notorious cause of poor morale. So they have \\~1.5 months to get results in a place that is going to be very hard to get results. \n\nAnd that assumes the Ukrainians don't reinforce too. Let's remember, if Russia shifts Wagner out of Bakhmut, then the UAF can shift forces too. And they'd need a shit ton fewer of them to hold the much better tactical situation in Avdiivka or elsewhere, straight lines, better ground, secure supply lines, etc, easier to defend.  \n\nEasier to defend means less artillery ammo consumed, which matters when they're supposedly prepping for a major offensive while crying about lack of ammo. And easier to defend means less casualties, kind of important if they want to retain quality while also having the quantity in their units keeping them at strength, not easy when they are feeding the better part of a dozen brigades at any given time into the Bakhmut meatgrinder. \n\nManpower and supplies are the concerns of operational and strategic commanders and their staff, who in the case of the Ukrainians made a bad decision.

The UAF took heavy losses resisting the initial invasion but that was nothing compared to the spring-summer Russian offensive. Between losses and growth, they are a much different force afterwards, best described as a mobilized army.</p>\n</div>",

Three years ago, he was convicted of murder and sentenced to a long prison term, but he was freed after volunteering to fight with the Wagner Group as a private military contractor.\n\nBack in Novy Burets, Rossomakhin drunkenly wandered the streets of the hamlet about 500 miles east of Moscow, carrying a pitchfork and threatening to kill everyone, residents said.\n\nDespite police promises to keep an eye on the 28-year-old former inmate, he was arrested in a nearby town on charges of stabbing to death an elderly woman from whom he once rented a room. He reportedly confessed to committing the crime, less than 10 days after his return.\n\nRossomakhin's case is not isolated. The Associated Press found at least seven other instances in recent months in which Wagner-recruited convicts were identified as being involved in violent crimes, either by Russian media reports or in interviews with relatives of victims in locations from Kaliningrad in the west to Siberia in the east.\n\nIn January, Prigozhin was seen in a video addressing a group of men said to be the first set granted amnesty after serving in Ukraine.\n\n\"You've worked through your contract. You worked honourably, with dignity,\" Prigozhin said in the clip published by Russia's Ria Novosti news agency. Prigozhin said the men \"should be treated with deepest respect by society\" after completing their contracts, but he added a warning, and was clearly aware of the risks:  \n\n\"Don't drink a lot, don't use drugs, don't rape women, do not get up to no good,\" Prigozhin could be heard telling the men.\n\nRossomakhin wasn't seen as valorous when he returned from fighting in Ukraine but rather as an \"extremely restless, problematic person,\" police said at a meeting with fearful Novy Burets residents that was filmed by a local broadcaster before 85-year-old Yulia Buyskikh was slain. At one point, he even was arrested for breaking into a car and held for five days before police released him March 27.\n\nRossomakhin wasn't seen as valorous when he returned from fighting in Ukraine but rather as an \"extremely restless, problematic person,\" police said at a meeting with fearful Novy Burets residents that was filmed by a local broadcaster before 85-year-old Yulia Buyskikh was slain. At one point, he even was arrested for breaking into a car and held for five days before police released him March 27.\n\nTwo days later, Buyskikh was killed.\n\n\"She knew him and opened the door, when he came to kill her,\" her granddaughter, Anna Pekareva, wrote on Facebook. \"Every family in Russia must be afraid of such visitors.\"\n\nOther incidents included the robbery of a shop in which a man held a saleswoman at knifepoint; a car theft by three former convicts in which the owner of the vehicle was beaten and forced to sign it over to them; the sexual assault of two schoolgirls; and two other killings besides the one in Novy Burets.\n\nIn Kaliningrad, a man was arrested in the sexual assault of an 8-year-old girl after taking her from her mother, according to a local media report and one of the girl's relatives.\n\nThe man had approached the mother and bragged about his prison time and his Wagner service in Ukraine, according to the relative, who spoke to AP on condition of anonymity out of safety concerns. The relative asked: \"How many more of them will return soon?\"\n\nA \"pattern of recidivist behavior\"\n\nIn its recruiting, Wagner usually offered convicts six-month contracts, according to media reports and rights groups. Then they can return home, unlike regular soldiers, who can't terminate their contracts and leave service as long as Putin's mobilization decree remains in effect. It wasn't immediately clear, however, whether these terms will be honored after Prigozhin's unsuccessful mutiny.\n\nPrigozhin, himself a former convict, recently acknowledged that some repeat offenders were Wagner fighters \u2014 including Rossomakhin in Novy Burets and a man arrested in Novosibirsk for sexually assaulting two girls.\n\nPutin recently said the recidivism rate \"is 10 times lower\" among the convicts that went to Ukraine than for those in general. \"The negative consequences are minimal,\" he added.\n\nThere isn't enough data yet to assess the consequences, according to a Russian criminology expert who spoke on condition of anonymity out of safety concerns. \n\nRomanova from Russia Behind Bars says there have been many troubling episodes involving convicts returning to civilian life after a stint in Ukraine.\n\nLaw enforcement and justice officials who spent time and resources to prosecute these criminals can feel humiliated by seeing many of them walk free without serving their sentences, she said.\n\nSome convicts who are caught committing crimes after returning home sometimes try to turn the tables on police by accusing them of discrediting those who fought in Ukraine \u2014 now a serious crime in Russia, she said.\n\nAsked if that deters those in law enforcement, Romanova said: \"You bet. A prosecutor doesn't want to go to prison for 15 years.\"\n\nShe paints a grim life in Russia's prisons, with rampant and incessant violence, extreme isolation, constant submission to guards and a strict hierarchy among inmates. For prisoners in those conditions, \"what would his mental state be?\" Gelmel asked.\n\nAdd in the trauma of being thrown into battle \u2014 especially in places like Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, the longest and bloodiest of the conflict, where Wagner forces died by the thousands, \"Imagine \u2014 he went to war. If he survived \u2026 he witnessed so much there. In what state will he return?\"",

At one point, he even was arrested for breaking into a car and held for five days before police released him March 27.</p>\n\n<p>Two days later, Buyskikh was killed.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;She knew him and opened the door, when he came to kill her,&quot; her granddaughter, Anna Pekareva, wrote on Facebook. &quot;Every family in Russia must be afraid of such visitors.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Other incidents included the robbery of a shop in which a man held a saleswoman at knifepoint; a car theft by three former convicts in which the owner of the vehicle was beaten and forced to sign it over to them; the sexual assault of two schoolgirls; and two other killings besides the one in Novy Burets.</p>\n\n<p>In Kaliningrad, a man was arrested in the sexual assault of an 8-year-old girl after taking her from her mother, according to a local media report and one of the girl&#39;s relatives.</p>\n\n<p>The man had approached the mother and bragged about his prison time and his Wagner service in Ukraine, according to the relative, who spoke to AP on condition of anonymity out of safety concerns. The relative asked: &quot;How many more of them will return soon?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>A &quot;pattern of recidivist behavior&quot;</p>\n\n<p>In its recruiting, Wagner usually offered convicts six-month contracts, according to media reports and rights groups. Then they can return home, unlike regular soldiers, who can&#39;t terminate their contracts and leave service as long as Putin&#39;s mobilization decree remains in effect. It wasn&#39;t immediately clear, however, whether these terms will be honored after Prigozhin&#39;s unsuccessful mutiny.</p>\n\n<p>Prigozhin, himself a former convict, recently acknowledged that some repeat offenders were Wagner fighters \u2014 including Rossomakhin in Novy Burets and a man arrested in Novosibirsk for sexually assaulting two girls.</p>\n\n<p>Putin recently said the recidivism rate &quot;is 10 times lower&quot; among the convicts that went to Ukraine than for those in general. &quot;The negative consequences are minimal,&quot; he added.</p>\n\n<p>There isn&#39;t enough data yet to assess the consequences, according to a Russian criminology expert who spoke on condition of anonymity out of safety concerns. </p>\n\n<p>Romanova from Russia Behind Bars says there have been many troubling episodes involving convicts returning to civilian life after a stint in Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>Law enforcement and justice officials who spent time and resources to prosecute these criminals can feel humiliated by seeing many of them walk free without serving their sentences, she said.</p>\n\n<p>Some convicts who are caught committing crimes after returning home sometimes try to turn the tables on police by accusing them of discrediting those who fought in Ukraine \u2014 now a serious crime in Russia, she said.</p>\n\n<p>Asked if that deters those in law enforcement, Romanova said: &quot;You bet. A prosecutor doesn&#39;t want to go to prison for 15 years.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>She paints a grim life in Russia&#39;s prisons, with rampant and incessant violence, extreme isolation, constant submission to guards and a strict hierarchy among inmates. For prisoners in those conditions, &quot;what would his mental state be?&quot; Gelmel asked.</p>\n\n<p>Add in the trauma of being thrown into battle \u2014 especially in places like Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, the longest and bloodiest of the conflict, where Wagner forces died by the thousands, &quot;Imagine \u2014 he went to war. If he survived \u2026 he witnessed so much there. In what state will he return?&quot;</p>\n</div>",

At one time, that Bulgakov, that Mizintsev, that Gorshenin were filmed for the actual collapse of the MTO system of the RF Armed Forces and reports that did not correspond to the situation. But the formal reason was the support of PMCs - and this is how it was presented to the public.\n\n>Exactly the same thing is now unfolding in all the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. The support of PMCs has become a litmus test against which the RF Armed Forces are scourged. **Surovikin has not been seen since Saturday - it is not known for certain where General Armageddon is located, there is a version that he is under interrogation.**\n\n>The actual leadership of the course of the special military operation is carried out by the commander of the Airborne Forces, Mikhail Teplinskiy. Valery Gerasimov formally retains the post of chief of the General Staff, but has nothing to do with resolving issues of the NMD.\n\n>But these cleansings concern not only the leadership - it also touched ordinary fighters with officers. Romanov writes about the pilots who refused to strike at mixed convoys with PMCs and civilians: they are now facing criminal prosecution. Two Majors report on border guards who did not open fire from small arms at a convoy of hundreds of pieces of equipment.\n\n>Such cases are an example of bureaucratic delirium and inertia of the system. In the conditions of the SVO and the loss of both the sides and the flight personnel, capable pilots are worth their weight in gold - they can prove their usefulness at the fronts in word and deed.

At one time, that Bulgakov, that Mizintsev, that Gorshenin were filmed for the actual collapse of the MTO system of the RF Armed Forces and reports that did not correspond to the situation. But the formal reason was the support of PMCs - and this is how it was presented to the public.</p>\n\n<p>Exactly the same thing is now unfolding in all the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. The support of PMCs has become a litmus test against which the RF Armed Forces are scourged. <strong>Surovikin has not been seen since Saturday - it is not known for certain where General Armageddon is located, there is a version that he is under interrogation.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The actual leadership of the course of the special military operation is carried out by the commander of the Airborne Forces, Mikhail Teplinskiy. Valery Gerasimov formally retains the post of chief of the General Staff, but has nothing to do with resolving issues of the NMD.</p>\n\n<p>But these cleansings concern not only the leadership - it also touched ordinary fighters with officers. Romanov writes about the pilots who refused to strike at mixed convoys with PMCs and civilians: they are now facing criminal prosecution. Two Majors report on border guards who did not open fire from small arms at a convoy of hundreds of pieces of equipment.</p>\n\n<p>Such cases are an example of bureaucratic delirium and inertia of the system. In the conditions of the SVO and the loss of both the sides and the flight personnel, capable pilots are worth their weight in gold - they can prove their usefulness at the fronts in word and deed. The border guards, according to military bureaucrats, should have decided to commit suicide.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of how the General Staff will be cleaned, in some cases it is quite possible to show flexibility and show adequacy.</p>\n\n<h1>VSRF #Russia #PMC</h1>\n\n<p>@rybar</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Surovikin has not been seen since Saturday - it is not known for certain where General Armageddon is located, there is a version that he is under interrogation.\n\nConsidering that the PMC whose interests he's asidously represented for the last ten years right up to their failed coup, which backed his appointment for the command he lost, and then fiercely supported his subsequent junior appointment is basically getting disbanded, it's not surprising that Surovikin might be under suspicion.\n\n\"His preferred media silence\" may be why he's not on TV (although not necessarily why reports about him are largely absent from TV, even though these days there's so much brass on Pervyi Kanal it looks like the History Channel's World War II Marathon), but I don't think that's valid grounds for discounting the *possibility* that he can't be on TV because he was too closely associated with Wagner.\n\nRemember when Achalov wasn't on TV for days after August 22? Do you think that was because, as deputy defense minister, he had to be naturally selective with his media appearances and cultivate an image of dignity and inaccessibility, or may it have possibly had something remotely to do with him having backed the party that launched a botched coup?",

I'll move this if one becomes available later.\n\nA while back I bored y'all with [(kind of) a list](https://old.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/14ikji1/credibledefense_daily_megathread_june_25_2023/jpgoqmz/?context=3) of the things I'm keeping an eye out for. Some of these are already developing, but I'd be prudent about reading too much into them. In particular, here are some things that I don't think we should read too much into.\n\nI don't think Prigozhin's charges being dropped should be taken as a sign of anything important for the moment. Lots of Western analysts are hung up on the legalistic character of the Russian political and military system, but IMHO it would be misapplied in this case. Its purpose is to shield *current* politicians from reprisals brought via legitimate legal mechanisms, or to exclude potential rivals through legitimate legal mechanisms. It does not exclude the use for paralegal mechanisms.\n\nCase in point: Alexander Litvinenko was arrested, acquitted, arrested again, and had the charges brought against him dropped, just like Prigozhin. He wasn't charged or prosecuted for anything when he was assassinated. Neither was Anna Politkovskaya. Sergey Skripal, to cite yet another high-profile assassination case known to Western audiences, is the only one who'd actually been tried and convicted of anything -- but sentenced to prison, not death, and his punishment had technically been terminated, as he'd been included in the Illegals Program, so he, too, was technically a free man when he was assassinated.\n\nRussia is one of the countries where the rule of law is not a thing. The fact that there are no formal charges being brought against him is not an indication of what the government's intentions are for him. At most it's an indication that the federal government would rather not see this go to trial. Whether that's because they want to get the revolt out of the public eye as soon as possible or because they'd rather deal Prigozhin silently is still a mystery IMHO.\n\nI also don't think that the fact he's still alive and was given real asylum in Belarus is a major indication of anything *yet*. The fact that this coup got to happen in the first place is a sign that Putin's position is shakier and less effective than he'd want to make known -- I don't want to join the ranks of Putin's apologists who insist this wasn't a sign of weakness, because it absolutely was.\n\nHowever, I don't think we should read too much into the fact that Prigozhin is still free, not yet in any case. It may be a symptom of Putin's weakness, and the result of a real inability to swiftly eliminate him (by assassination, or arrest, or whatever). However, it may also be a matter of ensuring a smooth transfer of Wagner resources under the MoD's authority.\n\nSuddenly and swiftly decapitating Wagner may be a strong political signal, but it would also mean suddenly and swiftly decapitating a company that employs several thousand people who have guns and drive company tanks, some of them with a very shady past (not just ex-cons but also outright *cons*), some of them foreign citizens. They're exactly the kind of people you don't want running around, even in Ukraine. Keeping Prigozhin alive and technically in control of Wagner up until most of this gets harmlessly transferred over to the MoD may be a good idea.\n\n(Oh, and my intrussive inner Tom Clancy voice also says, who knows, maybe it's even a way to make a move on Belarus, but Lukashenko wouldn't be *that* gulible, right? *Right!?*)",

It's highly unlikely that literally every single person employed by Wagner was in the damn column that headed for Moscow. Even if that had been swiftly crushed in an ambush and an overwhelming counter-attack, what about the several hundred, maybe even several thousand people everywhere else? What about the convicts who somehow survived Bakhmut, are still running around with weapons, and would've suddenly found themselves out of contract with a non-existent company? What about the Wagner personnel deployed overseas, protecting government assets all over Africa, or deployed along with SVR officers or diplomats? How do you deal with those?\n\nThis massive dildo of consequences is still going and it's still not very well lubed IMO. Wagner was a giant black ops program, financed partly, but not fully by the government. On the one hand it allowed running federal government programs with practically zero oversight. But on the other hand, the same lack of transparency and supervision that allowed the Kremlin to run every dirty, but necessary op via Wagner also made it a major liability, as it also meant ceding operational control of a large equipment and personnel base to a third-party that it's not tied to through any formal mechanisms.\n\nTransferring Wagner assets and personnel to the MoD will reclaim some of what was lost. But it'll do so at reduced efficiency, as any organisation is more than just the people it has on contract and the equipment they work with. And, more importantly, it won't immediately reclaim the informal mechanisms of power that have been created in all these years.",

But on the other hand, the same lack of transparency and supervision that allowed the Kremlin to run every dirty, but necessary op via Wagner also made it a major liability, as it also meant ceding operational control of a large equipment and personnel base to a third-party that it&#39;s not tied to through any formal mechanisms.</p>\n\n<p>Transferring Wagner assets and personnel to the MoD will reclaim some of what was lost. But it&#39;ll do so at reduced efficiency, as any organisation is more than just the people it has on contract and the equipment they work with. And, more importantly, it won&#39;t immediately reclaim the informal mechanisms of power that have been created in all these years.</p>\n</div>",

I&#39;m just wondering if anyone announced what those rates are, as I&#39;m wanting to create a bench mark to compare to in a month or so.</p>\n</div>",

In terms of artillery we might see a much larger portion of batteries held quiet to specifically be used for counter battery action versus as fire against line troops. This would still let them make good attacks, but would begin ratcheting up the medium term stress on the Russians a lot more.

The two are incredibly different - for one, SoE debt can be liquidated or discharged with little to no impact to credit rates and ratings. \n\nThe entire \"poor covid return\" is a meme - the recovery was less than expected because the impact of the covid policies was far lesser than what many mainstream analysts modelled as the Chinese economy had adjusted to a significant extent to them. Want to hear an interesting data point? In the first year of COVID, a far lesser portion of the Chinese population was under a lockdown than was the case in France or Canada. Why is that? Because harsher, earlier lockdowns were more effective, and prevented spread, which meant you had to lockdown less person-hours. \n\nThe Chinese real estate bubble already popped. Right now it's only projected to incur minor further contraction, on the order of 3-5%. \n\nChina is \"jucing\" the economy because they have dangerously low inflation rates, right now under 1%. Deflation is incredibly dangerous so fiscal stimulus is necessary. If anything all indicators are that China is not juicing enough.\n\nChina's economy is doing fine. It's not doing horribly, but it's doing just fine, especially given the decrease in demand in exports due to tightening in export partners.

The two are incredibly different - for one, SoE debt can be liquidated or discharged with little to no impact to credit rates and ratings. </p>\n\n<p>The entire &quot;poor covid return&quot; is a meme - the recovery was less than expected because the impact of the covid policies was far lesser than what many mainstream analysts modelled as the Chinese economy had adjusted to a significant extent to them. Want to hear an interesting data point? In the first year of COVID, a far lesser portion of the Chinese population was under a lockdown than was the case in France or Canada. Why is that? Because harsher, earlier lockdowns were more effective, and prevented spread, which meant you had to lockdown less person-hours. </p>\n\n<p>The Chinese real estate bubble already popped. Right now it&#39;s only projected to incur minor further contraction, on the order of 3-5%. </p>\n\n<p>China is &quot;jucing&quot; the economy because they have dangerously low inflation rates, right now under 1%. Deflation is incredibly dangerous so fiscal stimulus is necessary. If anything all indicators are that China is not juicing enough.</p>\n\n<p>China&#39;s economy is doing fine. It&#39;s not doing horribly, but it&#39;s doing just fine, especially given the decrease in demand in exports due to tightening in export partners.

Sergei Surovikin, the former top Russian commander in Ukraine, helped plan Mr. Prigozhin\u2019s actions last weekend, which posed the most dramatic threat to President Vladimir V. Putin in his 23 years in power.  \n>  \n>General Surovikin is a respected military leader who helped shore up defenses across the battle lines after Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive last year, analysts say. He was replaced as the top commander in January but retained influence in running war operations and remains popular among the troops.  \n>  \n>American officials also said there are signs that other Russian generals may also have supported Mr. Prigozhin\u2019s attempt to change the leadership of the Defense Ministry by force. Current and former U.S. officials said Mr. Prigozhin would not have launched his uprising unless he believed that others in positions of power would come to his aid.  \n>  \n>If General Surovikin was involved in last weekend\u2019s events, it would be the latest sign of the infighting that has characterized Russia\u2019s military leadership since the start of Mr. Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine and could signal a wider fracture between supporters of Mr. Prigozhin and Mr. Putin\u2019s two senior military advisers: Sergei K. Shoigu, the minister of defense, and Gen. Valery V. Gerasimov, the chief of general staff.  \n>  \n>Mr. Putin must now decide, officials say, whether he believes that General Surovikin helped Mr. Prigozhin and how he should respond.  \n>  \n>On Tuesday, the Russian domestic intelligence agency said that it was dropping \u201carmed mutiny\u201d criminal charges against Mr. Prigozhin and members of his force. But if Mr. Putin finds evidence General Surovikin more directly helped Mr. Prigozhin, he will have little choice but to remove him from his command, officials and analysts say.  \n>  \n>Some former officials say Mr. Putin could decide to keep General Surovikin, if he concludes he had some knowledge of what Mr. Prigozhin had planned but did not aid him. For now, analysts said, Mr. Putin seems intent on pinning the mutiny solely on Mr. Prigozhin.  \n>  \n>Senior American officials suggest that an alliance between General Surovikin and Mr. Prigozhin could explain why Mr. Prigozhin is still alive, despite seizing a major Russian military hub and ordering an armed march on Moscow.  \n>  \n>American officials and others interviewed for this article spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence. They emphasized that much of what the United States and its allies know is preliminary. U.S. officials have avoided discussing the rebellion publicly, out of fear of feeding Mr. Putin\u2019s narrative that the unrest was orchestrated by the West.  \n>  \n>Still, American officials have an interest in pushing out information that undermines the standing of General Surovikin, whom they view as more competent and more ruthless than other members of the command. His removal would undoubtedly benefit Ukraine, whose Western-backed troops are pushing a new counteroffensive that is meant to try to win back territory seized by Moscow.  \n>  \n>The Russian Embassy did not respond to a request for comment.  \n>  \n>General Surovikin spoke out against the rebellion as it became public on Friday, in a video that urged Russian troops in Ukraine to maintain their positions and not join the uprising.  \n>  \n>\u201cI urge you to stop,\u201d General Surovikin said in a message posted on Telegram. \u201cThe enemy is just waiting for the internal political situation to worsen in our country.\u201d  \n>  \n>But one former official called that message akin to \u201ca hostage video.\u201d General Surovikin\u2019s body language suggested he was uncomfortable denouncing a former ally, one who shared his view of the Russian military leadership, the former official said.  \n>  \n>There were other signs of divided loyalties in the top ranks. Another Russian general \u2014 Lt. Gen. Vladimir Alekseyev \u2014 made his own video appeal, calling any actions against the Russian state a \u201cstab in the back of the country and president.\u201d But hours later, he surfaced in another video, chatting with Mr. Prigozhin in the Russian city of Rostov-on-Don, where Wagner fighters seized military facilities.  \n>  \n>\u201cThere were just too many weird things that happened that, in my mind, suggest there was collusion that we have not figured out yet,\u201d Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia, said in a phone interview.  \n>  \n>\u201cThink of how easy it was to take Rostov,\u201d Mr. McFaul said. \u201cThere are armed guards everywhere in Russia, and suddenly, there\u2019s no one around to do anything?\u201d  \n>  \n>Independent experts, and U.S. and allied officials said that Mr. Prigozhin seemed to believe that large parts of Russia\u2019s army would rally to his side as his convoy moved on Moscow.  \n>  \n>Mr. Prigozhin had worked with General Surovikin during Russia\u2019s military intervention in Syria, and had described him as the most capable commander in the Russian army. Former officials said General Surovikin did not support pushing Mr. Putin from power but appears to have agreed with Mr. Prigozhin that Mr. Shoigu and General Gerasimov needed to be relieved of duty.  \n>  \n>\u201cSurovikin is a decorated general with a complex history,\u201d said Dara Massicot, a senior policy researcher at the RAND Corporation. \u201cHe is said to be respected by the soldiers and viewed as competent.\u201d  \n>  \n>General Surovikin and Mr. Prigozhin have both brushed up against Mr. Shoigu and General Gerasimov over tactics used in Ukraine. While the Russian military\u2019s overall performance in the war has been widely derided as underwhelming, analysts have credited General Surovikin and Mr. Prigozhin for Russia\u2019s few successes.  \n>  \n>In General Surovikin\u2019s case, that limited success was the professionally managed withdrawal of Russian troops from Kherson, where they were nearly encircled last fall and cut off from supplies. Based on communications intercepts, U.S. officials concluded that a frustrated General Surovikin represented a hard-line faction of generals intent on using the toughest tactics against Ukrainians.  \n>  \n>Similarly, Mr. Prigozhin\u2019s Wagner mercenaries achieved some success in taking the eastern city of Bakhmut after a nine-month slog in which, by Mr. Prigozhin\u2019s own count, some 20,000 Wagner troops were killed. U.S. officials and military analysts say tens of thousands of troops died in the fight for Bakhmut, among them Wagner soldiers who were former convicts with little training before they were sent to war. Mr. Prigozhin frequently complained that senior Russian defense and military officials were not supplying his troops with enough weapons.  \n>  \n>Russia\u2019s entire military campaign in Ukraine has been characterized by a musical chairs of changing generals. Last fall, when General Surovikin was put in charge of the Russian Army\u2019s effort in Ukraine, he was the second man to get the job, replacing a general who had lasted barely a month. General Surovikin did not last much longer, but performed far better during his weeks at the helm.  \n>  \n>Nevertheless, by January, General Surovikin was demoted, and Mr. Putin handed direct command of the war to General Gerasimov, who promised to put Russian forces back on the offensive. General Surovikin\u2019s demotion, military and Russia analysts say, was widely viewed as a blow to Mr. Prigozhin.",

At the same time, as the study progressed, the lines dividing these categories began to blur.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p><strong>Many of those who were outraged and discouraged by the decision to invade Ukraine in the early days of the conflict gradually came to the conclusion that the war, although deplorable, was inevitable, and are beginning to lean toward supporting the \u201cspecial military operations.\u201d These people are apolitical, and their apoliticality plays an important role in this evolution of opinion.</strong></p>\n\n<p>On the one hand, being unaccustomed to political thinking and the experience of political participation, many faced with war evaluated it not in political, but moral terms. This was their initial reason for not accepting the war \u2014 after all, mass military violence committed for no apparent reason is immoral. But it is precisely because of this depoliticization that they were unable to convert this indignation into a consistent political stance.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n</div>",

I would still argue that the coax is vital for long term ammo conservation of main gun rounds while still keeping an HMG for other secondary targets/threats. If you only have 40 rounds you can destroy 40 things at best. Not everything thing that needs to be killed needs to be killed with a main gun round. If your RWS HMG in a tank without a coax is engaging another target you don\u2019t want to have to be obligated to use a main gun round or traverse the HMG off its threat. Additionally if suppression of a target is required then it comes down to how frequently you\u2019re firing rounds/burst rather than how long or explosive those rounds/burst are that you\u2019re firing. In that case I want the 12,000 rounds of coax while still having another machine gun to engage secondary or tertiary targets if needed.

I would still argue that the coax is vital for long term ammo conservation of main gun rounds while still keeping an HMG for other secondary targets/threats. If you only have 40 rounds you can destroy 40 things at best. Not everything thing that needs to be killed needs to be killed with a main gun round. If your RWS HMG in a tank without a coax is engaging another target you don\u2019t want to have to be obligated to use a main gun round or traverse the HMG off its threat. Additionally if suppression of a target is required then it comes down to how frequently you\u2019re firing rounds/burst rather than how long or explosive those rounds/burst are that you\u2019re firing. In that case I want the 12,000 rounds of coax while still having another machine gun to engage secondary or tertiary targets if needed. I do agree though that the HMG that\u2019s usually for the commanders seat absolutely should and probably will be a RWS in future tanks.</p>\n</div>",

Face plants leading to teeth knocked out, sprained angles, hyperextend knees, broken legs, herniated backs are all very common. Military parachutes meant for static line jumps are designed to get the paratrooper to the ground as fast as possible without dying. Jump school is designed to teach the very basics of how to survive that jump without injury, assuming everything goes right, assuming the aircraft doesn't miss the drop zone and drop everyone into a forest, city, lake, etc, which is when the heavier losses occur.\n\n>or are people just expected to be ok with breaking their legs?\n\nThis is why there has been a long standing argument against modern airborne forces. They'll never do it in a contested environment. It's very dangerous and costly even in training. Etc. \n\nThe counterargument is the nature of the job requires very disciplined, athletic, aggressive, brave light infantry, so it makes it worth keeping because they're very useful in non-airborne ops. \n\nPlus the airborne dominate the US Army top brass who will keep kidding themselves that maybe they might actually jump in combat. \"But muh airfield seizures!\"",

It often becomes important when you have already tried it - it is addictive. There is a whole palette of sensations and opportunities that are hard to give up - I say this as someone who has experienced both the pleasure of owning one and the disappointment of losing one. In the 2014, people did not join for money - they joined for an idea and a leader. Of course, it was not twenty-five thousand men - only four thousand - but it was also a lot. But at a certain point I came to realise that as the state was being established in the territories which had rebelled against Ukraine, the system would become nervous of the fact of owning a loyal private army. And then the question came before me: what do I personally need these people for?  \n>  \n>It became part of me, gave me status, inspired me - but I and these people were just a historical tool that had to fulfil its role, and no matter how much cat scratching - there was no getting away from it. An algorithm was defined for the transfer of the volunteer unit to the state systtem, only one battalion was left under my control so I would not be bored in our turbulent times - and Vostok continued to serve further in the army as one regiment and three battalions of territorial defense - essentially ordinary motorized rifle battalions.  \n>  \n>The main question that arises in this case is what goals and interests you serve. Are you able to overcome your own pride for the sake of higher meanings, or will your ego win out? There is a great temptation, it is true. But it is possible to overcome this temptation, if your loud words about the homeland are not empty words. I assembled my combatants and told them: we continue to serve as we served. No one is going anywhere - stay with your soldiers - they need you. In about six months I calmly handed over the \"authority\" to the army men of the Ministry of Defence, to first encounter all the peculiarities of that agency, - but my men continued to serve the Motherland and to carry out combat tasks. And many of them are still fighting today and continue to regard me as their commander.",

In the 2014, people did not join for money - they joined for an idea and a leader. Of course, it was not twenty-five thousand men - only four thousand - but it was also a lot. But at a certain point I came to realise that as the state was being established in the territories which had rebelled against Ukraine, the system would become nervous of the fact of owning a loyal private army. And then the question came before me: what do I personally need these people for?  </p>\n\n<p>It became part of me, gave me status, inspired me - but I and these people were just a historical tool that had to fulfil its role, and no matter how much cat scratching - there was no getting away from it. An algorithm was defined for the transfer of the volunteer unit to the state systtem, only one battalion was left under my control so I would not be bored in our turbulent times - and Vostok continued to serve further in the army as one regiment and three battalions of territorial defense - essentially ordinary motorized rifle battalions.  </p>\n\n<p>The main question that arises in this case is what goals and interests you serve. Are you able to overcome your own pride for the sake of higher meanings, or will your ego win out? There is a great temptation, it is true. But it is possible to overcome this temptation, if your loud words about the homeland are not empty words. I assembled my combatants and told them: we continue to serve as we served. No one is going anywhere - stay with your soldiers - they need you. In about six months I calmly handed over the &quot;authority&quot; to the army men of the Ministry of Defence, to first encounter all the peculiarities of that agency, - but my men continued to serve the Motherland and to carry out combat tasks. And many of them are still fighting today and continue to regard me as their commander.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Kramatorsk is a large city close to both Zaporizhia and Donbas frontlines and so likely has many soldiers staying there.
