        "body": "An update and expansion from what I posted yesterday on Leopard 1 and 2 tank commitments\n\n**LEOPARD 2**\n\nTotal: 14 L2A6 / 33-35 L2A4\n\n**Germany**: 14 -  2A6s - https://archive.is/uD5dO\n\n>Chancellor Olaf Scholz came in for criticism in recent months from EU partners for his apparent hesitation to supply Ukraine with battle tanks. On Jan. 25, he announced that Germany would send 14 state-of-the-art Leopard 2 A6s as part of a coordinated effort to provide two full battalions. They are expected to be shipped at the end of March.\n\n**Poland**: 14 - 2A4s - https://archive.is/QaANc\n\n>On Friday, Polish Deputy Defence Minister Marcin Ociepa told private broadcaster RMF FM that it would be around three months before Leopard tanks reached Ukraine.\n\n>\"It depends what country we are talking about, but I would estimate that we are talking about around a quarter... until those tanks can really be on Ukrainian territory and go into battle,\" he said.\n\nFrom https://archive.is/uD5dO\n\n>Poland has said it will deliver an older version of the tank, the A4, but will need spare parts from Germany. Those parts, however, are no longer in production.\n\n**Norway**: 8 - 2A4s- https://archive.is/9vcoH \n\n>Norway will donate 8 tanks and up to 4 special purpose tanks to Ukraine. We are also earmarking funds to ammunition and spare parts, says Minister of Defence Bj\u00f8rn Arild Gram.\n\n>...\n\n>... We will also contribute with educating and training Ukrainian tanks-crew in Poland, along with other allied countries.\n\n>...\n\n>The tanks-package will also include the donation of ammunition and spare parts. In addition, Norway will also offer 250MNOK to the EU Ukraine-fund, European Peace Facility. The funds will be earmarked for ammunition and spare parts for the Leopard II.\n\n\n**Canada**: 4  - 2A4s - https://archive.is/2PHOR\n\n>Canada will supply Ukraine with four Leopard 2 A4 main battle tanks and Canadian Armed Forces trainers to teach Ukrainian soldiers how to operate the vehicles, Defence Minister Anita Anand announced Thursday.\n\n**Portugal**: 3 - https://archive.is/nett2\n\n>LISBON, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Portugal is repairing some its Leopard 2 tanks and will send three to war-torn Ukraine next month, Prime Minister Antonio Costa said on Wednesday.\n\n>The announcement came after Costa said on Saturday the southern European nation was in talks with Germany to obtain parts needed to repair inoperable Leopard tanks in Portugal's inventory.\n\n>\"Right now we are implementing the recovery and maintenance plan for the Leopard 2 tanks and, according to the plan, we are in a position to be able to send three of them in March,\" Costa told parliament.\n\n>\"This is what we are working towards,\" Costa added.\n\n>Admiral Antonio Silva Ribeiro, the head of the Portuguese armed forces, said last month Portugal had 37 Leopard 2 tanks but local media has widely reported that most are inoperable.\n\n**Spain**: 2A4s - between 4 and 6 - https://archive.is/J4iqE\n\n>Spanish government sources have told EL PA\u00cdS that the Madrid shipment would initially consist of between four and six units.\n\n**Finland**: No decision, and probably not soon - https://archive.is/mpzH9\n\n>However, Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin told Suomi radio on Sunday that her government had yet to reach a decision on the matter. She noted that Finland's 1,300 kilometer (808 mile) border with Russia must be taken into account when considering the shipment of weapons to Ukraine.\n\nhttps://archive.is/J0fNN\n\n>A senior NATO official said Finland signaled it would most likely hold direct tank deliveries until it officially joins the alliance, a move that is currently being blocked by Turkey. Even after it becomes a member, Finland, which has around 240 tanks, would only be able to spare a few, the official said.\n\n**Sweden** - No decision made - https://archive.is/mpzH9\n\n>Sweden, another partner that initially seemed open to sending Leopards, also hasn\u2019t yet decided what to do.\n\n**Netherlands**: Could not buy leased German 2A6s and send to Ukraine - https://archive.is/naako \n\n>Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the only tanks his country could provide in theory were 18 Leopard-2 tanks leased to the country from Germany. Both countries decided that these tanks were not available for Ukraine.\n\n**Denmark**: 0 \n\n>The Danish government, which possesses 44 tanks in its arsenal, told Welt that it would not participate in Germany's tank coalition. However, both the Netherlands and Denmark have committed financial resources to refurbishing 100 Leopard-1 tanks in German warehouses.\n\n**LEOPARD 1**\n\nTotal L1A5s: Up to 178 / possibly 237\n\n**Germany, Denmark, and the Netherlands**: Up to 178\n\nhttps://archive.is/JgUFR \n\n>News agency dpa quoted Germany\u2019s defense minister, Boris Pistorius, as saying during a visit to Kyiv on Tuesday that the first 20-25 Leopard 1 tanks would reach Ukraine this summer. Pistorius\u2019 office said German authorities have authorized the export of up to 178 Leopard 1 A5 tanks to Ukraine, but noted that the actual number sent would depend on the refurbishments required.\n\nhttps://archive.is/EVdjm \n\n>German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius, on a surprise visit to Kyiv, said between 20 and 25 of the tanks would arrive by summer, about 80 by the end of the year and another 100 in 2024, according to a statement by Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov's office after the counterparts met.\n\nBelgium: 50 possibly if they can cut a deal with OIP - https://archive.is/5uBma\n\n>It\u2019s obvious where those first hundred Leopard 1s will come from: German firms Rheinmetall and FFG Flensburger, which respectively have 88 and 99 Leopard 1A5s in storage.

On Jan. 25, he announced that Germany would send 14 state-of-the-art Leopard 2 A6s as part of a coordinated effort to provide two full battalions. They are expected to be shipped at the end of March.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Poland</strong>: 14 - 2A4s - <a href=\"https://archive.is/QaANc\">https://archive.is/QaANc</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>On Friday, Polish Deputy Defence Minister Marcin Ociepa told private broadcaster RMF FM that it would be around three months before Leopard tanks reached Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;It depends what country we are talking about, but I would estimate that we are talking about around a quarter... until those tanks can really be on Ukrainian territory and go into battle,&quot; he said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From <a href=\"https://archive.is/uD5dO\">https://archive.is/uD5dO</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Poland has said it will deliver an older version of the tank, the A4, but will need spare parts from Germany. Those parts, however, are no longer in production.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Norway</strong>: 8 - 2A4s- <a href=\"https://archive.is/9vcoH\">https://archive.is/9vcoH</a> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Norway will donate 8 tanks and up to 4 special purpose tanks to Ukraine. We are also earmarking funds to ammunition and spare parts, says Minister of Defence Bj\u00f8rn Arild Gram.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>... We will also contribute with educating and training Ukrainian tanks-crew in Poland, along with other allied countries.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>The tanks-package will also include the donation of ammunition and spare parts. In addition, Norway will also offer 250MNOK to the EU Ukraine-fund, European Peace Facility. The funds will be earmarked for ammunition and spare parts for the Leopard II.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Canada</strong>: 4  - 2A4s - <a href=\"https://archive.is/2PHOR\">https://archive.is/2PHOR</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Canada will supply Ukraine with four Leopard 2 A4 main battle tanks and Canadian Armed Forces trainers to teach Ukrainian soldiers how to operate the vehicles, Defence Minister Anita Anand announced Thursday.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Portugal</strong>: 3 - <a href=\"https://archive.is/nett2\">https://archive.is/nett2</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>LISBON, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Portugal is repairing some its Leopard 2 tanks and will send three to war-torn Ukraine next month, Prime Minister Antonio Costa said on Wednesday.</p>\n\n<p>The announcement came after Costa said on Saturday the southern European nation was in talks with Germany to obtain parts needed to repair inoperable Leopard tanks in Portugal&#39;s inventory.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Right now we are implementing the recovery and maintenance plan for the Leopard 2 tanks and, according to the plan, we are in a position to be able to send three of them in March,&quot; Costa told parliament.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;This is what we are working towards,&quot; Costa added.</p>\n\n<p>Admiral Antonio Silva Ribeiro, the head of the Portuguese armed forces, said last month Portugal had 37 Leopard 2 tanks but local media has widely reported that most are inoperable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Spain</strong>: 2A4s - between 4 and 6 - <a href=\"https://archive.is/J4iqE\">https://archive.is/J4iqE</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Spanish government sources have told EL PA\u00cdS that the Madrid shipment would initially consist of between four and six units.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Finland</strong>: No decision, and probably not soon - <a href=\"https://archive.is/mpzH9\">https://archive.is/mpzH9</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>However, Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin told Suomi radio on Sunday that her government had yet to reach a decision on the matter. She noted that Finland&#39;s 1,300 kilometer (808 mile) border with Russia must be taken into account when considering the shipment of weapons to Ukraine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://archive.is/J0fNN\">https://archive.is/J0fNN</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>A senior NATO official said Finland signaled it would most likely hold direct tank deliveries until it officially joins the alliance, a move that is currently being blocked by Turkey. Even after it becomes a member, Finland, which has around 240 tanks, would only be able to spare a few, the official said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Sweden</strong> - No decision made - <a href=\"https://archive.is/mpzH9\">https://archive.is/mpzH9</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sweden, another partner that initially seemed open to sending Leopards, also hasn\u2019t yet decided what to do.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Netherlands</strong>: Could not buy leased German 2A6s and send to Ukraine - <a href=\"https://archive.is/naako\">https://archive.is/naako</a> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the only tanks his country could provide in theory were 18 Leopard-2 tanks leased to the country from Germany. Both countries decided that these tanks were not available for Ukraine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Denmark</strong>: 0 </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Danish government, which possesses 44 tanks in its arsenal, told Welt that it would not participate in Germany&#39;s tank coalition. However, both the Netherlands and Denmark have committed financial resources to refurbishing 100 Leopard-1 tanks in German warehouses.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>LEOPARD 1</strong></p>\n\n<p>Total L1A5s: Up to 178 / possibly 237</p>\n\n<p><strong>Germany, Denmark, and the Netherlands</strong>: Up to 178</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://archive.is/JgUFR\">https://archive.is/JgUFR</a> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>News agency dpa quoted Germany\u2019s defense minister, Boris Pistorius, as saying during a visit to Kyiv on Tuesday that the first 20-25 Leopard 1 tanks would reach Ukraine this summer. Pistorius\u2019 office said German authorities have authorized the export of up to 178 Leopard 1 A5 tanks to Ukraine, but noted that the actual number sent would depend on the refurbishments required.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://archive.is/EVdjm\">https://archive.is/EVdjm</a> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius, on a surprise visit to Kyiv, said between 20 and 25 of the tanks would arrive by summer, about 80 by the end of the year and another 100 in 2024, according to a statement by Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov&#39;s office after the counterparts met.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Belgium: 50 possibly if they can cut a deal with OIP - <a href=\"https://archive.is/5uBma\">https://archive.is/5uBma</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It\u2019s obvious where those first hundred Leopard 1s will come from: German firms Rheinmetall and FFG Flensburger, which respectively have 88 and 99 Leopard 1A5s in storage. The Danish, German and Dutch governments will buy back the stored tanks, pay to refurbish them then transfer them\u2014along with ammunition and spare parts\u2014to the Ukrainian government.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe first ones [are] being delivered within a few months,\u201d the partnership announced.</p>\n\n<p>Our \u2018Leo 1 A5 Initiative\u2019 is open to further partners,\u201d the three tank-donors explained. \u201cBelgium has also shown initial interest to participate\u201d in the partnership.

Oil is a completely different story. Natural gas cannot be transported as easily as oil can, and mostly goes by pipelines that have been built throughout the last half-century. LNG exists but is much less relevant for Russia than pipelines.\n\n* If we exclude Turkey-bound TurkStream and BlueStream (they have their own caveats), there's 3 main Europe-bound gas pipelines: NS1, Yamal-Europa, \"Ukraine transit\" (it is actually several pipelines, but we can bunch them together). They are different in operating costs, conditions, and capacity. NS1 was about 25% of total RU-Europe exports and 30% of the theoretical max pipeline capacity.\n\n* [Russia's gas exports](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FoXwnOUXgAAbUOw?format=jpg&name=medium) to Europe crashed and are unlikely to recover.\n\n* [NS1 transit was reduced by Russia's Gasprom](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FoXwqYfXgAA1sW_?format=jpg) in successive steps until it was completely halted on Aug 31st. A few days later Russia announced that the pipeline is stopped indefinitely. It was blown up on Sep 25th.\n\n* Today Ukraine Transit and Turkstream are the only pipelines delivering natural gas to Europe. Both have plenty unused capacity. Yamal-Europe has its entire capacity idling.\n\n* Ukraine Transit is a complicated story: Russia pays Ukraine to deliver its gas to Europe, and it is one of the most expensive options for Russia (NS1 was almost 40% cheaper). There's many hairy details and many people with strong opinions about the RU/UA gas scandals of the 00s and 10s, but today Ukraine's gas exports are net positive.\n\nAny wild speculation on whodunnit should be grounded in these facts.",

This is not a new lesson: Napoleonic France, Wilhelmine Germany, Nazi Germany, and imperial Japan all suffered catastrophic defeats at the hands of powerful balancing coalitions. Aggression sometimes pays, but usually only when a powerful state can arrange to fight its victims one-on-one. The Ukraine war shows that favorable circumstances of this kind are hard to arrange, because overt acts of aggression tend to unite other states in opposition. If any heads of state are pondering whether to launch a war to change the status quo, taking this lesson to heart will spare them a great deal of trouble and make for a more peaceful and prosperous world.",

This is not a new lesson: Napoleonic France, Wilhelmine Germany, Nazi Germany, and imperial Japan all suffered catastrophic defeats at the hands of powerful balancing coalitions. Aggression sometimes pays, but usually only when a powerful state can arrange to fight its victims one-on-one. The Ukraine war shows that favorable circumstances of this kind are hard to arrange, because overt acts of aggression tend to unite other states in opposition. If any heads of state are pondering whether to launch a war to change the status quo, taking this lesson to heart will spare them a great deal of trouble and make for a more peaceful and prosperous world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

The agency fielded just 100 tips in the program\u2019s first two years and made no payments to whistleblowers.\n\n>Under the law enacted Dec. 29, whistleblowers can report violations of economic sanctions like those imposed on Russian oligarchs to FinCEN. Tipsters whose information leads to financial recoveries will now get minimum payments, replacing a system with no guaranteed awards.  \n\n>The new law is enticing informants to provide information on a variety of misdeeds, including how banks secretly help Russian President Vladimir Putin conduct his war in Ukraine.\n\n>\u201cIt is going to hit Putin and his cohorts where it hurts,\u201d said attorney Stephen Kohn.\n\n>Kohn represents two whistleblowers outside the US who claim a bank caters to sanctioned Russian oligarchs and entities and may have failed to flag suspicious flows of Russian money through the US, according to a redacted complaint filed with regulators. The Washington lawyer wouldn\u2019t identify the bank or his clients, citing concerns about retaliation. \n\n>The FinCEN changes come as the Justice Department\u2019s \u201cKleptoCapture\u201d task force hunts for yachts, private jets and hidden cash tied to sanctioned Russians.

The agency fielded just 100 tips in the program\u2019s first two years and made no payments to whistleblowers.</p>\n\n<p>Under the law enacted Dec. 29, whistleblowers can report violations of economic sanctions like those imposed on Russian oligarchs to FinCEN. Tipsters whose information leads to financial recoveries will now get minimum payments, replacing a system with no guaranteed awards.  </p>\n\n<p>The new law is enticing informants to provide information on a variety of misdeeds, including how banks secretly help Russian President Vladimir Putin conduct his war in Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt is going to hit Putin and his cohorts where it hurts,\u201d said attorney Stephen Kohn.</p>\n\n<p>Kohn represents two whistleblowers outside the US who claim a bank caters to sanctioned Russian oligarchs and entities and may have failed to flag suspicious flows of Russian money through the US, according to a redacted complaint filed with regulators. The Washington lawyer wouldn\u2019t identify the bank or his clients, citing concerns about retaliation. </p>\n\n<p>The FinCEN changes come as the Justice Department\u2019s \u201cKleptoCapture\u201d task force hunts for yachts, private jets and hidden cash tied to sanctioned Russians. At first, the program only focused on violations of the Bank Secrecy Act, the anti-money laundering law that requires financial institutions to know their customers, report suspicious activities to FinCEN, and monitor high-risk transactions.</p>\n\n<p>President Joe Biden signed the Anti-Money Laundering Whistleblower Improvement Act as part of the $1.7 trillion funding bill.

My thesis is that exactly by overestimating their influence we are granting them influence they wouldn't otherwise have.\n\nThe problem is that by the majority of people actively trying to 'protect debate from bad faith actors' they are in fact just dividing debate into 'camps' and making debate on BOTH sides entirely at the whims of the misinformation campaigns that *do* exist.\n\nAs an example (it's often better to reflect on the behavior of one's own side), were you to individually look at reports, i'd bet that according to responses on reddit ukraine hasn't caused a single civilian casualty in this conflict because individually every single missile that kills a civilian can just be claimed as a russian false flag attack. After all we don't trust russia and they're engaged in industrial scale psy-ops right? Therefore the element of doubt which credibly should exist turns into complete distrust and refusal to accept negative information.\n\nIn essence the problem is that the partisanship of discussion on both sides has made it so that both sides are living in a world of disinformation, largely of their own making. It's no different to what happens in domestic politics (best demonstrated by the US) where what is true is determined by your political alignment, not by what is true. If i'd spent years being told that my vote wasn't real and it was actually the russians then i'd probably gravitate to the outlet that wasn't telling me I was an indoctrinated idiot (such as may be fox news) and ironically 4 years of the 'liberal' media essentially saying trump wasn't a legitimate president is exactly what enabled January 6th, not that dems would ever accept it. It takes two sides for these scenarios to develop. I myself engaged in similar behavior following the devastation of the brexit vote, I've just come to realise what I was doing.\n\nDivisive discourse leads to divisive information leads to divisive decisions etc etc etc. It's a death spiral and (once again) is going to continue to destroy democracy from within.",

            "body": "Information Medium affects behavior. Different online social media Platforms have their own structures. \n\nReddit for example stopped being an Immediate/Live/Developing-Story source in early-mid 2010s.  \nPlatforms like Twitter is what took that role with High Volume-High Cadence information generation. Reddit simply can not compete with that structurally. \n\nHowever one can not have a \"Clear/Comprehensible\" back-forth verbose discussion on Twitter, the structure just doesn't allow for that.\n\nEven using Small or Large typing screen/instruments (Mobile or Desktop or Physical Keyboard) affects tone, semantics, argument structure of users/writers (Wharton did a great podcast based on study on this few years back).

        "body": "While chips get the headlines at the moment, the old favourite of great poewr competition, space is still an area that is vital. Perhaps it may soon be more so than any time since the mid 70s, when the us lead in (you guessed it, chips) meant it could sustain long duration automated spy satellites and began switching from film to digital. \n\nThere was a narrative about China over taking the US and a counter narrative about \"new space\" rewriting all the rules. \n\n[https://twitter.com/thesheetztweetz/status/1625534198818783232](https://twitter.com/thesheetztweetz/status/1625534198818783232)\n\nLast quarter of 2022 Space Explorations of Hawthorn California (they are moving or may have moved) put double the mass of CASC (China) into orbit and more than the rest of the world put together. Insane as that included a NASA moon launch (Artemis I) and a component for the Tiangong space station. \n\nChina does have a comercial space launch sector, most built round solid launchers.

Russia was cutting off supply, that's it.  imho putin was obviously trying to use energy prices as pressure to divided the west.  when the pipelines were blown up, prices soared even higher.  Who was that immediate result beneficial for?  Not the west, but certainly a positive for Putin.\n\n>Fair enough - it should really say, \"[The US had a motive to sabotage the pipeline because it would be] reducing the potential for a return to European reliance on Russian energy imports.\" As for repair potential, I'm very confident that the US / NATO has the capability to covertly disable the pipeline again if need be. It's not really a defensible target, after all.\n\nThat is at best a marginal benefit for the US, and no where near the threshold of value for it to (1) attack an ally's energy infrastructure and (2) open the door in this conflict beyond indirect US military involvement, contained to Ukraine and limited to conventional military tactics.

No shortage of reporting on that, and IIRC a fair range was best case six months and more likely about a year to repair and get going again.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>But the fact remains because of disablement of the pipeline, the option has been taken out of the game entirely, for the time being, which changed the negotiation in a major way.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There was no negotiation.  Russia was cutting off supply, that&#39;s it.  imho putin was obviously trying to use energy prices as pressure to divided the west.  when the pipelines were blown up, prices soared even higher.  Who was that immediate result beneficial for?  Not the west, but certainly a positive for Putin.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Fair enough - it should really say, &quot;[The US had a motive to sabotage the pipeline because it would be] reducing the potential for a return to European reliance on Russian energy imports.&quot; As for repair potential, I&#39;m very confident that the US / NATO has the capability to covertly disable the pipeline again if need be. It&#39;s not really a defensible target, after all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is at best a marginal benefit for the US, and no where near the threshold of value for it to (1) attack an ally&#39;s energy infrastructure and (2) open the door in this conflict beyond indirect US military involvement, contained to Ukraine and limited to conventional military tactics.

Thank you very much for your question.  I want to be absolutely clear: We have intensively prepared everything to be ready with the necessary sanctions if there is a military aggression against Ukraine.  And this is necessary.  It is necessary that we do this in advance so that Russia can clearly understand that these are far-reaching, severe measures. It is part of this process that we do not spell out everything in public because Russia could understand that there might be even more to come.  And, at the same time, it is very clear we are well prepared with far-reaching measures.

Russia was trying to coerce buyers into paying for gas (Nord Stream is gas, not oil) with rubles. Unlike some countries, Germany agreed to open accounts in rubles.
