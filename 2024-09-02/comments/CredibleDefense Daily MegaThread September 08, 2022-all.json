        "body": "Strelkov chararacterization of DNR/LNR forces:  \n\"A little about the problems (the most acute ones) that do not allow me to criticize the fighters and commanders of the DPR/LPR, who (according to some couch strategists) \"do not hold their positions steadfastly enough.\" What (in the opinion of these bloggers) is the reason for the rapid advance of the enemy in a number of important sectors during his current offensives.For clarity, I will give a \"generalized portrait\" of a company of Donetsk / Luhansk \"mobiks\" (\"ironheads\") operating in the N direction of the N front.\n\nSo:The company was recruited as part of \"a hundred ... some\" regiment of the NM DPR in late February - early March of this year from the mobilized. From its initial payroll, 3-5 people previously took part in hostilities, served in the army (any - Soviet, Ukrainian, NM DPR) - another 15 people. The company is commanded by a reserve officer who did not fight at all either in the 14th year or later. Sometimes (not always) he has a deputy officer - the same reserve officer with no combat experience. Platoon commanders were appointed just those who managed to visit the situation, \"at least close to combat\" from 2014 to 2022. There weren't enough for the departments.For six months, the company (initially numbering just over 100 people) greatly \"lost weight\" - from a quarter to a third of the personnel. Approximately half of the losses were in combat - artillery shelling, sniper strikes, being captured by a Ukro-DRG, etc. The rest - dropped out as a result of an exacerbation of old diseases that did not allow their owners to serve and were not identified when enlisting in the troops due to the complete absence of a medical commission (or its conduct according to the principle: \u201cDo you have a head, two arms and two legs? Are you younger than 70? - good!\"). Half of the remaining 60-70 fighters are limited-fit due to age and sores that have not yet brought their owners to an unbearably lying state. 85% of the personnel of the company - were not on vacation at home for more than 6 months, and 15% of the lucky ones - were on vacation for 5 days (plus 2 days on the road, which few of them managed to meet due to difficulties with transport).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe company is armed, for the most part, with AK-74 assault rifles of the 2nd or 3rd wear category, but a certain number of \"Mosins\" and \"Degtyarev\" machine guns (DP-28) are still in service. Mortars - no, grenade launchers - 1-2 pieces (there are a dozen of them for the entire regiment), from the regiment one c DShK is attached, which no one in the company knows how to use, not to mention disassemble / assemble it. Body armor - did not see. There are no means of communication. Night vision devices or (especially) thermal imagers - similarly. There is one simple optical (tourist) binoculars - the company commander. The existence of drones is well known, but not because of their presence in the company, but because such enemy vehicles regularly correct artillery fire on the company or drop ammunition on it. Trench tool - what was found and collected in nearby villages. The company does not have its own transport ( in the regiment, too, but - for the reasons stated below - even the presence in the regiment does not affect the capabilities of the company in any way). Uniforms and shoes received six months ago by the method - \"what was thrown during the distribution and what I managed to catch\" - have worn out in places to tatters, but no one is in a hurry to replace them. With all the rest of the equipment, the picture is the same - its replenishment occurs among employees almost exclusively at the expense of those who have retired.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe entire regiment (then still entirely) in early March of this year. - without teaching AT ALL (nothing at all, so even company commanders often didn\u2019t even know how to equip a magazine for a machine gun at the beginning of a campaign) they were sent to X ... district X ... regions to guard rear checkpoints. Then someone decided that the \"mobiles\" were too well armed and \"settled too well\" - they were replaced at checkpoints by heavily armed \"Rosgvardia\", and the regiment turned out to be pulled apart on a front 50-70 km wide, with than many companies ended up in not only different Russian regiments and brigades, but even different \"armies\" and \"corps\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOur \"example\" company, for example, turned out to be attached to the N-th battalion of the N-th separate motorized rifle brigade. There are about 50 people in the battalion (together with the rear), of which half are officers. The rest are 1/3 in losses, and 2/3 in the \"five-hundredths\" (since the battalion also did not change or replenish for half a year). True - the battalion \"shared\" with the company a whole chemical forces major and a lieutenant - but (what a bad luck!) Both of them two weeks ago (let's say) were captured by the DRG together with 9 fighters of our company. And why? - but because even our \"sparse\" company turned out to be stretched for one and a half kilometers of the front (sometimes more), its platoons and defensive areas are at distances between themselves that exclude visual communication between the fighters in the trenches.  No one in the company has heard of \"forwards OPs\"  and the commanders are not able (due to the lack of both experience and authority) to force their exhausted fighters to go beyond the forward trenches.There is no barbed wire in front of the company positions. Camo nets- none. No one knows that signal mines exist in nature, since no one has ever seen them. Anti-personnel mines are known to be the enemy has a couple of explosions in his rear (on those set up by enemy recon units ) already. There are no anti-tank ones either (in the battalion they are attached to - the same). Illumination rockets?- The \"parent\" battalion commander has a score (on the fingers of one hand), but he does not give them to the \"mobiles\". It's the same with chemical smokes and other engineering munitions.In the event of an enemy attack, it was ordered to report on the \"field telephone\" about the attack and \"firmly defend, waiting for reinforcements.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSomehow, at the end of summer, the enemy suddenly opens heavy artillery fire on the trenches of the company. Since all positions had been shot for a long time, the command post of the company was destroyed immediately. Together with the only \"field phone\". One platoon of the company, where there was no commander (he fell ill a week ago, he was taken to the service with diabetes) - ran as soon as the shelling stopped. Another platoon, having got out of hiding, found on the parapet of the trench a group of heavily armed men in someone else's uniform and with blue bandages on their sleeves. A couple of people twitched - they were immediately shot dead. The rest were taken prisoner. The third platoon managed to get together and fired back at the enemy all day and even managed (probably) to inflict some losses on him. But by nightfall, the platoon ran out of ammunition for machine guns and shots for grenade launchers. In addition, it (defended, for example, in the ruins of the village of Glukhoy Ovrag) was hit by its own artillery (there are no communications and spotters). Having lost half of the composition, the platoon retreated to the rear in the dark, carrying out several wounded. To voluntarily surrender - we must pay tribute - no one did.The next day, the battalion commander of the \"owner's\" battalion reported to the top that: \"the mobiles fled at the first shots, so we could not hold the position.\" The fact that his battalion (led by the staff of the battalion command post) hastily retreated long before the aforementioned platoon had used up all the ammunition - the battalion commander prudently did not report.And whoever tells me that everything described is \"a lie and a provocation\" - I will laugh in his face. Even if it is an investigator.  \nhttps://.me/strelkovii/3181\n\n(add \"t\" before \".me\")",

                            "body": "The UAF have to hold off Russian counterattacks from the north and east that will likely be coming rather quickly. They'll pull units from Kharkiv and the reserves in the Belgorod rear area, transport them to the north side of the bulge, and soon as they have enough artillery unloaded after the guns are limbered up, they're going to launch a big ass attack, potentially that'll include a river crossing from the east too (the Oskil river north of the city isn't very wide). \n\nThen there is a large Russian force in the south, multiple CAAs, who are probably not going to be sitting on their hands waiting patiently to see how this battle turns out while they starve. Likely a significant part of them are going to be turned around to counterattack the south side of the salient. They will still possess up to week's worth of supplies or more, depending on how many and how well stocked their brigade, division, and CAA level supply depots are. Them too, as fast as it takes for their arty to pick up and move north, and have enough ammo on hand, they're going to attack in force.\n\nTo defend their new lines, the UAF are going to need to hold a new salient at least 80 kilometers long if they want to hold all the way to Kupyansk. Their supply line will be a single road that will be in artillery range of both the north and south side of the salient. 80 kilometers long and with a reported 4x brigades inside the salient (the other two are holding the shoulders \"on the flanks\"). The types of brigades means they have a total of 13x battalions of infantry, which means they each need to hold ~6 km for every battalion. If the Russians attack in strength by doctrine, and they have every motivation to mass as best as they can, they can match the frontage of a single UAF battalion with a full  brigade or more, with a whole lot of arty firing too. That is not going to be an easy line to defend, and if it breaks, they can be encircled themselves (always a danger for narrow thrust salients). \n \nPlus, UAF logistics are going to be problematic. Their supply line just increases by more than 40 km (they were already well behind the front line to start), with all those brigades in the salient forced to use a single two lane road for truck resupply, reinforcements, casualty evacuation, and  tactical mobility.. At least some of their arty is going to have to move partly into the salient to continue covering them in the east, and that's going to mean more congestion, plus needing to moving large quantities of arty ammo too. And again, that single road is going to be in range of every Russian artillery piece they use for the counterattack. \n\nPro-Russian OSINT \"analysts\" were  earlier reporting that preparations for UAF attacks were being detected coming from down the M03, south, from the Sloviansk axis towards Dolyna. Unlike the Balakliya sector, the one south of Izyum is not a weak point, and there is no element of surprise for the UAF to use to their advantage. The possibility of launching a successful attack there in order to even budge that line is pretty small, and it can be potentially very costly for the UAF because the Russians now expect an attack against them, they have their arty there well supplied and registered, and they're suddenly very motivated to pay the fuck attention. \n\nSo why are the Ukrainians doing it? Assuming they're not idiots then they're making showy gestures of an attack in that direction, possibly even willing to launch some limited attacks to sell it enough to be real, because it's fixing operation, if the Russians are stuck defending that sector they can't counterattack the Kupyansk salient. \n\nMy wild ass guess is that the Ukrainians will conduct a deliberate and well executed retreat to Shevchenkove. Unless they get HEAVILY reinforced, as in a bunch more brigades (at least 3x high tier mech type brigades. Not to hold the line, it's way too narrow now, but to expand it's width, especially if they can't reach any sort of defensible ground to hold the line easier. \n\nBut even if they have to retreat back to the start line (which they won't need to), this is still a hell of an accomplishment considering UAF losses so far were probably pretty low. Between the losses Russia suffered and the disruption to their operations in that operational area, this is a textbook diversionary attack that is quite impressive.",
                            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>The UAF have to hold off Russian counterattacks from the north and east that will likely be coming rather quickly. They&#39;ll pull units from Kharkiv and the reserves in the Belgorod rear area, transport them to the north side of the bulge, and soon as they have enough artillery unloaded after the guns are limbered up, they&#39;re going to launch a big ass attack, potentially that&#39;ll include a river crossing from the east too (the Oskil river north of the city isn&#39;t very wide). </p>\n\n<p>Then there is a large Russian force in the south, multiple CAAs, who are probably not going to be sitting on their hands waiting patiently to see how this battle turns out while they starve. Likely a significant part of them are going to be turned around to counterattack the south side of the salient. They will still possess up to week&#39;s worth of supplies or more, depending on how many and how well stocked their brigade, division, and CAA level supply depots are. Them too, as fast as it takes for their arty to pick up and move north, and have enough ammo on hand, they&#39;re going to attack in force.</p>\n\n<p>To defend their new lines, the UAF are going to need to hold a new salient at least 80 kilometers long if they want to hold all the way to Kupyansk. Their supply line will be a single road that will be in artillery range of both the north and south side of the salient. 80 kilometers long and with a reported 4x brigades inside the salient (the other two are holding the shoulders &quot;on the flanks&quot;). The types of brigades means they have a total of 13x battalions of infantry, which means they each need to hold ~6 km for every battalion. If the Russians attack in strength by doctrine, and they have every motivation to mass as best as they can, they can match the frontage of a single UAF battalion with a full  brigade or more, with a whole lot of arty firing too. That is not going to be an easy line to defend, and if it breaks, they can be encircled themselves (always a danger for narrow thrust salients). </p>\n\n<p>Plus, UAF logistics are going to be problematic. Their supply line just increases by more than 40 km (they were already well behind the front line to start), with all those brigades in the salient forced to use a single two lane road for truck resupply, reinforcements, casualty evacuation, and  tactical mobility.. At least some of their arty is going to have to move partly into the salient to continue covering them in the east, and that&#39;s going to mean more congestion, plus needing to moving large quantities of arty ammo too. And again, that single road is going to be in range of every Russian artillery piece they use for the counterattack. </p>\n\n<p>Pro-Russian OSINT &quot;analysts&quot; were  earlier reporting that preparations for UAF attacks were being detected coming from down the M03, south, from the Sloviansk axis towards Dolyna. Unlike the Balakliya sector, the one south of Izyum is not a weak point, and there is no element of surprise for the UAF to use to their advantage. The possibility of launching a successful attack there in order to even budge that line is pretty small, and it can be potentially very costly for the UAF because the Russians now expect an attack against them, they have their arty there well supplied and registered, and they&#39;re suddenly very motivated to pay the fuck attention. </p>\n\n<p>So why are the Ukrainians doing it? Assuming they&#39;re not idiots then they&#39;re making showy gestures of an attack in that direction, possibly even willing to launch some limited attacks to sell it enough to be real, because it&#39;s fixing operation, if the Russians are stuck defending that sector they can&#39;t counterattack the Kupyansk salient. </p>\n\n<p>My wild ass guess is that the Ukrainians will conduct a deliberate and well executed retreat to Shevchenkove. Unless they get HEAVILY reinforced, as in a bunch more brigades (at least 3x high tier mech type brigades. Not to hold the line, it&#39;s way too narrow now, but to expand it&#39;s width, especially if they can&#39;t reach any sort of defensible ground to hold the line easier. </p>\n\n<p>But even if they have to retreat back to the start line (which they won&#39;t need to), this is still a hell of an accomplishment considering UAF losses so far were probably pretty low.

Literally in human memory. And it's not like current government is starting to beat some drums of war to change that. Nothing.\nAnd even if they had some crazy ideas, being on the right-most fringe of viable parties, they're most likely on the way out next year. So maybe this is some attempt to gain popularity by ensuring security, but it doesn't seem like it's gonna fly since opposition is basically on the same page, but pointing out excessive spending which seems to resonate. \n\nAs I said in another reply - I sure hope we're getting some killer deal on that hardware, because it's wasting a lot of money otherwise.\n\nEdit:\n\nActually I can think of a single ideological foundation that could rattle on the heads of our current leaders and could maybe use some hardware. Good old [Prometheism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheism) - the idea of destroying Russian empire by empowering non-Russian peoples in its territory. It could perhaps took form of directly supporting opposition sides in potential civil wars. Think Belarus going kinetic. \n\nThat's the only situation where I could perhaps, maybe, possibly, slightly, barely image Poland using its armed forces in a fashion that isn't purely defense of its own territory or in support of allies.

        "body": "Edit: After typing this all out and reading it back, it seems pretty clear that I'm just recognizing some similar elements, but there is not much to suggest that they will lead to a similar outcome, i.e. continuation until complete military collapse. It does, however, seem like a plausible outcome based on the political similarities. And I think Ukraine is wise to assume that they will need to force a complete collapse in order to win.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------\n\nI've been thinking a lot about the **similarities and differences between the Ukraine invasion and the western front of WWI**. I'm just a layman, but it's been very interesting for me to learn about the larger context. Please let me know what you guys think about this.\n\nI'm CERTAIN that much of this must be wrong, embarrassingly wrong, or simply foolish. But it seems plausible to me so I would appreciate some more knowledgeable input.\n\n**Similarities:**\n\n1. Artillery-focused warfare.\n2. Autocracy fighting an alliance of democracies (generally).\n3. Initial invasion takes a large amount of territory, then lines move very little for a long time. Aggressor planned to conquer victim quickly, but failed.\n4. Attritional warfare - tactical success does not translate to strategic success.\n\n**Differences** (too many to list, but some specifics that impact the items above):\n\n1. Precision-strike capability much farther behind enemy lines.\n2. The world has done a pretty good job of not escalating to WWI levels of direct boots-on-the-ground fighting by allies.\n3. Putin's autocracy is somewhat constrained compared to the Kaiser's -- apparently he can't mobilize for total war at will.\n4. Ukraine and its allies have learned the tactical and strategic lessons of WWI (maybe).\n5. The German military in WWI was broadly competent and well-supplied compared to its opponents, at least initially.\n\nThe most important similarity, to me, is the political and broadly strategic similarity. It is **an attritional conflict that will end when one side is no longer able to make war**. Since Russia is autocratic, it can sustain a massively costly aggressive war, with no clear benefits or objectives, far longer than any sane regime could. In WWI, Germany literally starved its civilian population to death so that it could send mashed turnips to the front lines and keep its soldiers barely functional. I don't think Russia's ability to sustain war is on the same level of insanity as WWI Germany's, but it is some unknown distance into the realm of insanity.\n\nThe propaganda is similar as well: tough, proud, traditional Germany/Russia must surely prevail versus the decadent democracies that couldn't possibly have the same will to fight. Russia's plan, apparently, is that Ukraine's allies will get tired of winning because it is too uncomfortable to continue blowing up the Russian military. But, Russia badly underestimates how sustainably pissed the world is.\n\nIt also seems to me that **military conquest itself is the goal of the aggressor regime** in both cases. Putin is not making war in Ukraine in order to help Russia; he is using Russia to engage in a war of conquest for its own sake. The costs to the Russian people don't matter for him: the reason that the Russian people exist, for Putin, is to enable conquest. For him, the ability to conquer is the measure of a nation's worth.\n\nI think the outcome may be the same. **Putin will continue the war until it is physically impossible for the Russian military to continue making war.** Ukraine knows this, and is fighting a long war of attrition strategically. They are not engaging in foolish offensives \"for glory\" or to \"show progress.\" They are shaping the battlefield, going after logistics and GLOCs, and fighting for strategic attritional benefits rather than tactical territorial successes. It seems that Russia hasn't quite learned these lessons.\n\nAt least, that seems like a plausible interpretation -- maybe the Kharkiv offensive will turn out to be a tactical success/strategic failure like the German Spring Offensive. They are certainly using similar tactics of a broad attack, bypassing hard points, etc. It seems really impossible to tell what the strategic situation is in a conflict like this by looking at the battle lines. I like to think that the Russian tactical successes are really strategic failures by attrition, and whatever Ukraine does is a strategic successes no matter what the tactical situation looks like. Such is my motivated reasoning and wishful thinking. I think the ultimate outcome of the Kharkiv offensive will be telling. I hope that it's good news for Ukraine strategically.\n\nI also hope that the Russian ability to sustain war is much less than that of WWI Germany, which seems to clearly be the case from the lack of mobilization. Russia military competency is also starting in a very poor state compared to the German military in WWI, so this may affect the timeline for military collapse.\n\nI know the answer to all questions is almost always \"it's impossible to know.\" But again, I'm pretty sure that I must be really wrong about some of the things above, so please let me know your thoughts.",
