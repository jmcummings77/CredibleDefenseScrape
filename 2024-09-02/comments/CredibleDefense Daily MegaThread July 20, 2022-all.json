Did Collins mention this idea in his memo to Secretary of State Christopher? No? He didn&#39;t? What did Collins say?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>On NATO, Collins notes that the Russians are aware that the U.S. internal debate is reaching a crucial moment about expansion and want to be assured that the door is open to Russia, not just to East Europeans. In Collins\u2019 view, \u201cwhat the Russians hope to hear from you is that NATO is not moving precipitously and that any policy NATO adopts will apply equally to them.\u201d <strong>Their \u201cneuralgic\u201d attitude stems from the fear that they will \u201cend up on the wrong side of a new division of Europe.\u201d</strong> Therefore, Collins counsels Christopher to make sure the Russians know that the U.S. is actively promoting Russia\u2019s &quot;complete reintegration into the family of Western states.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is the part you don&#39;t want to talk about, because it ruins your narrative. This is also where you start whining about &quot;not legitimate! Not the real reason! Burden of proof is on them!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>That was the analysis of our then charges d&#39;affaires and later US Ambassador to Russia. I repeat: it was the analysis of <em>our</em> then charges d&#39;affaires. That <strong>did not</strong> come from Yeltsin or any other Russian.</p>\n\n<p>Now, Collins isn&#39;t infallible. Of course not. But the only reason you repeatedly dismiss his own analysis is...that it doesn&#39;t fit. Your. Narrative.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>legitimate</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You keep using that word.

It is current practice to give brigades an extra light infantry battalion (or 2) from the volunteer regiments, but I have no specific info on whether this practice is being brought forward to the newly formed brigades, so a total of 16-19 fresh battalions.</p>\n\n<p>The 115th TD Brigade will be renumbered.</p>\n</div>",

What you don't want to hear is that everybody's initial performance was bad (the Germans excepted).

It also has a shorter boost phase, making it harder to target the singular booster rather than the numerous warheads/countermeasures.

It has been speculated the Sarmat has [fractional orbital bombardment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_Orbital_Bombardment_System) capability which would allow it unlimited range, reduce detection times by ground based radars, and prevent determining the warheads' target until the last moment.

The US has space based detection systems that will identify an ICBM launch within seconds. It is believed current US strategic doctrine would see a full scale nuclear strike regardless of where the Russian warheads are targeted.

        "body": "Okay, so yesterday I talked about would it be better to have 25 F35s or spend that money on 5000 heavy pieces of ground equipment. Which is better?\n\nWell, I'd like to look how expensive F35s are and what ground equipment could be bought for the same money.\n\nHere is the assumption, each F35 will have 2 qualified pilots and each pilot will need about 150 hours per year to stay effective. Additionally, the cost to fly the F35 (all in - amortizing the purchase cost) is $30k/hr. We'll also assume a 30 year life for the jets and ground equipment. \n\nSo for 25 aircraft, you are looking at 50 pilots that will fly for 7,500 hours per year. That comes out to about 225 million dollars per year. \n\nNow, for the heavy/advanced ground equipment (artillery, HIMARs, AA, Main Battle Tanks, etc). Lets say the equipment costs about 5 million dollars per unit and costs about 1 million dollars/year for maintenance and the crew (roughly 10 people, 100k per person for room/board, training, ammo, etc). So the cost is roughly 166k/year to purchase and 1 million dollars to have a competent crew. So you are looking at 1.16 million dollars per year per piece of equipment. That comes out to about 200 pieces of heavy ground equipment. Well, looks like I have to eat my words, when factoring in training, the F35s cost A LOT less than I thought when compared to advanced ground equipment. \n\nOf course, you can always buy more equipment than competent crew, but what's the point of having equipment if you don't have the crew to work it? I think a lot of politicians make that mistake. Buy the equipment but don't factor in a training budget. \n\nIf you were a small, eastern European country, which would you rather have?\n\nI don't know the answer to this. I think if you are an island country like Taiwan or Australia, you'd absolutely want the F35s as they can do multiple roles - hit naval targets with standoff weapons like NSM OR hit ground targets after the beech landing and you could have aerial defense weapons. If you are a small European country that has a strong relationship with the USA, maybe you'd want the ground equipment as sophisticated ground equipment could deny the enemy air superiority (like we see in Ukraine) and fast reaction forces with MANPADs and anti-tank weapons with a lot of artillery. \n\nBut then there is another problem, F35s are really really good for combined arms type operations. \"Eyes in the sky\" with their sophisticated electronics suite and their anti-air capability. Additionally, every military needs to police their airpsace, so they already need a small number of fighter jets. So just spending an extra 50-100 million per year would give you an upgrade from 25 F16s or older jets to a fully modernized F35 fleet. The F35 fleet would have a lot more capability than even F16s. Especially going up against other modern air fighters. \n\nThere is a final problem with the F35s. If the enemy has a lot of ground based air defense, it's very very unlikely that 25 F35s will be effective at all in ground attacks. They'll be too vulnerable to ground based anti-air (stealth only helps reduce radar cross section - it doesn't stop visual or IR acquiring the target) and will have to remain far behind enemy lines. We're starting to see the development of such weapons. Starstreak is a good example, yet the F35 *should* be able to fly high enough to not be hit by starstreak in it's current form. A similar truck mounted system with a bigger rocket should be able to knock out the F35 if visually acquired. \n\nSo honestly, I don't know what the answer is. A little bit of both is probably the best as you never want to put too many eggs in one basket anyway.",

Which adversaries will be fought (or need to be deterred)?\n\n2.And, for those adversaries, in which contexts/goals/situations?\n\n2. And, from there, thus what missions need to be done?\n\n4. From that, what forces will be most effective?\n\nI think it's safe to say that if we were planning on a proxy war via Ukraine against Russia in which Ukraine was intact, we'd have a different mix of stuff - we thought they'd fold and equipped them for an insurgency.  Now that they are holding, we need to give a different mix of stuff than we gave and to some extent have. You are seeing real-time innovation on the battlefield to explore what works better.\n\nOf course, there are big assumptions on both who we might confront, and then how we might confront them. Getting that wrong makes the entire downstream strategy choices incorrect... There's some set of situations where an f35 is the right thing to have, and others where it's cost ineffective. We saw a good amount of that in some of our wars, where $100k missiles were blowing up $5 tents.\n\nMinor comment: RE Starstreak, it won't hit an f35 flying at adequate altitude as Starstreak is rated for a 23k ft ceiling - we fly those planes high for that reason, with stealth characteristics, and then have PGMs that are plenty accurate from high altitudes and long distances.\n\nFor US in general, I personally think we have a manned aircraft bias, and an allergy to redundant modular components across our ecosystem in favor of very expensive fully integrated things, but I'm also a computer science and automated process nerd. I just see a ton of former pilots making decisions, and it makes it easier for me to believe that there's a bias in that direction, especially without a crucible to test what works. We concoct war games to try to test stuff, but those scenarios still are defined on assumptions of who we will fight and what they will have, which may not be correct.

We saw a good amount of that in some of our wars, where $100k missiles were blowing up $5 tents.</p>\n\n<p>Minor comment: RE Starstreak, it won&#39;t hit an f35 flying at adequate altitude as Starstreak is rated for a 23k ft ceiling - we fly those planes high for that reason, with stealth characteristics, and then have PGMs that are plenty accurate from high altitudes and long distances.</p>\n\n<p>For US in general, I personally think we have a manned aircraft bias, and an allergy to redundant modular components across our ecosystem in favor of very expensive fully integrated things, but I&#39;m also a computer science and automated process nerd. I just see a ton of former pilots making decisions, and it makes it easier for me to believe that there&#39;s a bias in that direction, especially without a crucible to test what works. We concoct war games to try to test stuff, but those scenarios still are defined on assumptions of who we will fight and what they will have, which may not be correct.
