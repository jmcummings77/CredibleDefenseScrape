      "selftext": "The r/CredibleDefense daily megathread is for asking questions and posting submissions that would not fit the criteria of our post submissions. As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster. Don't abuse it though! If something is not obviously against the rules but you still feel that it should be reviewed, leave a short but descriptive comment while filing the report.",

It couldn&#39;t reliably penetrate US air defenses until the advent of the ICBM. </p>\n\n<p>The simple truth is that Soviet DA VS (SAC equivalent) was not the mirror of SAC that would&#39;ve been required to penetrate US airspace and retaliate against a US attack. No quick-reaction alert, no preplanned dispersal airbases, and no massive IADS-penetration exercises. Once the US got ICBMs, there was a fair chance that <em>all</em> of the bombers could&#39;ve been caught on the ground by a surprise missile attack.</p>\n\n<p>Even early Soviet ICBMs were vulnerable. R-7 took 24 hours to fuel and couldn&#39;t be left fueled for more than a day. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>it was a scaringly popular idea in the US government.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It wasn&#39;t.</p>\n</div>",

Prigozhin, leader of the Wagner mercenary group, who used what he said were the newly bloody corpses of his fighters as the backdrop for another expletive-laced rant against the top military command. Not for the first time, he threatened to pull his fighters out of the long-embattled Ukrainian city of Bakhmut if the Ministry of Defense did not provide more ammunition.\n\n>That was just one of a series of events that contributed to a sense that the war effort, and by extension the country, was adrift, even as Russia prepares to observe the biggest military holiday of the year next Tuesday.\n\n>Two explosions rocked the Kremlin in the middle of the night on Wednesday, in what the Russians claimed was a failed drone attack by Ukraine. Denying the accusation, Ukraine said Russia might have done it to try to muster domestic support for a faltering war effort. No matter the culprit, symbolically it seemed to many to signal Kremlin weakness.\n\n>That came in tandem with attacks on a number of oil storage facilities, igniting huge fires, and train derailments both near the border and well away from the battlefields, all attributed to Ukrainian drones or sabotage.\n\n>Adding to the building sense of anxiety, the head of Russia\u2019s Security Council, Nikolai Patrushev, bizarrely accused the United States in an interview of having started the war to seize territory ahead of a supposed cataclysmic explosion of a volcano at Yellowstone National Park, which he said would wipe out life in North America.\n\n>\u201cEveryone is nervous, sitting on the edge of their seats,\u201d said Clifford Kupchan, a Russia specialist and chairman of the Eurasia Group, a Washington-based political risk assessment firm. \u201cYou have the most revered Russian military holiday dovetailing with the coming Ukrainian offensive and all of these explosive events.\u201d\n\n>The holiday, Victory Day, commemorates the Soviet Union\u2019s triumph over Nazi Germany, and in the last two decades President Vladimir V.

But he is under some pressure himself to rally the nation in his scheduled nationwide Victory Day speech.\n\n>\u201cThe longer Putin is silent, the more everyone will think that he is confused and does not know what to do,\u201d Abbas Gallyamov, a former Kremlin speechwriter turned political analyst, wrote on Telegram.\n\n>In one sign of heightened security fears, Red Square, at the very heart of Moscow, and the venue for the viewing stands for the elite during the parade, has been closed to the public since the end of April. Numerous parades around the country are being scaled back or canceled.\n\n>The one in Moscow, however, is expected to be the usual, carefully choreographed display of raw power, even if the reputation of the Russian military has been diminished. Some pro-war bloggers have lashed out at the business-as-usual parade, saying the men and weapons would be better deployed in Ukraine.\n\n>Part of that is because so much is riding on the outcome of the anticipated Ukrainian drive.\n\n>\u201cMany people see this offensive as decisive in the war,\u201d said Dmitri Kuznets, who monitors the military bloggers for Meduza, an independent Russian website in Riga, Latvia. \u201cEveryone is very emotional and people\u2019s interpretation depends on their political views.\u201d\n\n>In a sign of the growing anxiety, the Russian occupation authorities on Friday ordered civilians living near the front line in the Zaporizhzhia region, in southern Ukraine, to leave their homes and businesses.\n\n>\u201cI would like to stress that this is a mandatory measure to ensure the safety of residents living in frontline territories,\u201d the Kremlin-appointed governor of the region, Yevgeny Balitsky, said in a statement.

In addition to the attacks on oil depots in Crimea, on Friday, drones hit a refinery in the Krasnodar region of southern Russia, Russian state media reported.\n\n>Mr. Prigozhin has unleashed similar rants previously, but Mr. Putin has been loath to publicly rebuke either him or the top military leaders whom the mercenary leader denigrated \u2014 Sergei K.

Gerasimov, the chief of staff of the armed forces.\n\n>Over the course of the war, Mr. Prigozhin and the generals have maneuvered bureaucratically and on the battlefield to gain the upper hand in directing the war and to win Mr. Putin\u2019s confidence.

We don't do propaganda.\"\n\nNow, this sub is definitely better than the rest of Reddit, but there are still some narratives at play here that people readily buy into.

He went on to point out that they had calculated the amount of memory the application would leak in the total possible flight time for the missile and then doubled that number.  They added this much additional memory to the hardware to \"support\" the leaks.  Since the missile will explode when it hits it's target or at the end of it's flight, the ultimate in garbage collection is performed without programmer intervention.\"\n\n\nThat old disaster with the patriot missile that failed to fire (in the 90's) due to an integer truncation error is another example of sloppy programming in practice. \n\nI don't think you can rule out any amount of organizational, technical, or contractual dysfunction, but at the same time, when you think about it, it is *political dysfunction*, for a broad definition of politics.\n\nI mean, it isn't completely impossible to write pretty safe software in a reasonable timeframe.

He went on to point out that they had calculated the amount of memory the application would leak in the total possible flight time for the missile and then doubled that number.  They added this much additional memory to the hardware to &quot;support&quot; the leaks.  Since the missile will explode when it hits it&#39;s target or at the end of it&#39;s flight, the ultimate in garbage collection is performed without programmer intervention.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>That old disaster with the patriot missile that failed to fire (in the 90&#39;s) due to an integer truncation error is another example of sloppy programming in practice. </p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t think you can rule out any amount of organizational, technical, or contractual dysfunction, but at the same time, when you think about it, it is <em>political dysfunction</em>, for a broad definition of politics.</p>\n\n<p>I mean, it isn&#39;t completely impossible to write pretty safe software in a reasonable timeframe. There are obviously hard technical problems there, but that isn&#39;t generally what holds the industry back.</p>\n</div>",
