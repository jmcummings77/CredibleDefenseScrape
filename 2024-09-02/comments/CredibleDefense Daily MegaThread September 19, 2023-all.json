During the early part of the war, many shocking videos, photographs, and news stories came out of the southern part of the country as it was surrounded while it still had some communication, and other stories came out of Bucha, Irpin, Izyum, and Kherson as successful warfighting pushed the Russians back. Are there any current narratives of what everyday life is like for civilians in the occupied areas, in particular the south? Supposedly that massive cemetery north of Mariupol has doubled in size--I doubt they're turning over ground to make a golf course.",

Reuters reports the donation will consist of 30 Leopard 1 tanks and 15 T-72 tanks, citing the Ritzau news agency.\n\nBoth purchases are said to be in cooperation with countries that have the tanks available to them. The T-72s see below; the Leopard 1s I'm guessing are the ones purchased by Rheinmetall from OIP. \n\n>The Czech Republic has signed a letter of intent with Denmark and the Netherlands on financial support for deliveries of Czech weapons to Ukraine, the country\u2019s defence ministry said on Tuesday.\n\n>The ministry said it would help cover supplies of additional tanks, howitzers, small arms, air defence capacities and forms of electronic warfare or ammunition. [Reuters reports](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/czechs-get-funding-denmark-netherlands-ukraine-weapon-supplies-2023-09-19/) it said the first project would be the donation of modernised T-72EA tanks in the near future.\n\nExcalibur Army had stated before that they had been contracted for 90 in the Netherlands/US deal but had the option for another 30. So it looks like Denmark joined the Netherlands to provide the last 30. At $1 million USD, that's been a pretty good deal. However, the article also states that over half of the 90 have been sent to Ukraine. Which is about the same pace they had in April when they said 37 had been delivered: roughly 5 a month.

Poroshenko certainly didn't \"found\" the main pro-russian party, although he was allied to them at some points, and was known to generally work with those who were in power, be it pro-Western or pro-Russian forces. \n\nAnd your point about Roshen proves that he was willing to work with Russia, despite being hawkish in public. That's precisely why I think OP's point stands. Putin invaded because he lost all hope to negotiate with Zelensky, so who knows, maybe Poroshenko could've either stalled negotiations again or maybe given concessions to Putin (because if he were to get re-elected in 2019, he wouldn't be able to go for another term anyway).\n\nIt's a tough hypothetical though, because if Putin was to attack Ukraine anyways, Poroshenko would be more likely to flee from Kyiv and his media presence would be much less effective than that of Zelensky. It's also really hard to imagine him actually winning those 2019 elections in the first place. Maybe if Zelensky wasn't running at all, otherwise fat chance. \n\nAs for his hawkish stance and army, he did help AFU to actually get their shit together at first. But since the conflict became frozen, and no one thought Russia would invade, it was costly (in his opinion anyway) to keep the resources focused on army, so he mostly neglected it since 2017, only the Donbass direction was somewhat fortified. Therefore, the chances are Ukraine still wouldn't be ready for invasion.",

Putin invaded because he lost all hope to negotiate with Zelensky, so who knows, maybe Poroshenko could&#39;ve either stalled negotiations again or maybe given concessions to Putin (because if he were to get re-elected in 2019, he wouldn&#39;t be able to go for another term anyway).</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s a tough hypothetical though, because if Putin was to attack Ukraine anyways, Poroshenko would be more likely to flee from Kyiv and his media presence would be much less effective than that of Zelensky. It&#39;s also really hard to imagine him actually winning those 2019 elections in the first place. Maybe if Zelensky wasn&#39;t running at all, otherwise fat chance. </p>\n\n<p>As for his hawkish stance and army, he did help AFU to actually get their shit together at first. But since the conflict became frozen, and no one thought Russia would invade, it was costly (in his opinion anyway) to keep the resources focused on army, so he mostly neglected it since 2017, only the Donbass direction was somewhat fortified. Therefore, the chances are Ukraine still wouldn&#39;t be ready for invasion.</p>\n</div>",

And so was east of Mariople.\n\nPersonally in these threads before the war my guess was that they would not go for Kiev, but try to take everything east of the Dniper.

But they were definitely visible and close to the front line the week before.\n\nThe Russian invasion force was largely not told about the invasion until 24-72 hours before, all to preserve OPSEC. Which means around 21 Feb a bunch of Russians would have started blabbing that would be easily caught by HUMINT and SIGINT. And as soon as they started moving to their assembly areas they would be talking on radios, which means MASSIVE increase in SIGINT. And we now know most of them were using unsecure channels and no frequency hopping, so anyone could listen in.\n\nThen the Donbas separatists start shelling the JFO.

He didn't activate the TDF, an organization that already existed on paper (contrary to reserves for all military aged males to join up). The ground units didn't leave their garrison bases to take up defensive positions near the border. Only a few units are known to have even left their garrisons and moved anywhere, the 72 Bde and one arty brigade, both to reinforce Kyiv, which were still nowhere near the border.

Russia alone has the power to end this war immediately. And it\u2019s Russia alone that stands in the way of peace, because Russia\u2019s price for peace is Ukraine\u2019s capitulation, Ukraine\u2019s territory and Ukraine\u2019s children.\u201d\n\n>The plea to continue supporting Kyiv comes as Biden prepares to host Zelenskiy at the White House on Thursday.

Ukrainian forces are engaged in a grueling counteroffensive to retake land lost to Russia and Zelenskiy has pressed allies for additional assistance.\n\n>It also comes at a time when the embattled global body is facing yet another diplomatic crisis. Canada this week accused Indian operatives of assassinating a Sikh leader on Canadian soil, allegations the Indian government denied. The spat leaves Biden caught between one of the US\u2019s closest allies and a key partner in countering China.\n\n>Biden is seeking $24 billion for Ukraine, but conservatives in the House have threatened to shut down the US government if a budget deal includes what they call a \u201cblank check\u201d for Kyiv. House conservatives have bristled at Biden\u2019s support for Ukraine and called for imposing more conditions on or halting aid. Congress faces a Sept. 30 deadline to pass additional government funding.\n\n>Biden\u2019s comments follow remarks from a senior State Department official earlier Tuesday that the US and allies in the Group of Seven understand the war will last for the medium or long term and that their planning should reflect that outcome.\n\n>The official spoke to reporters on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, summarizing a dinner among officials Group of Seven industrialized democracies the night before. Allies must ensure that Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion fails and there is sufficient burden-sharing, the official said.\n\n>Biden on Tuesday also addressed the US relationship with China, which has seen tensions grow between the world\u2019s two largest economies. Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping have not spoken since November 2022 as the countries have sparred over their technological ambitions, Taiwan, and an alleged Chinese spy balloon that crossed the US.\n\n>\u201cWhen it comes to China, I want to be clear and consistent: we seek to responsibly manage the competition between our countries so it does not tip into conflict,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe also stand ready to work together with China on issues where progress hinges on our common efforts.\u201d",

This is evidenced, in particular, by the identified fragments of the rocket recovered at the scene of the tragedy.&quot; </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2023/09/19/7420459/\">https://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2023/09/19/7420459/</a></p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve seen several outlets with a similar comment to this one:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Censor.NET&#39;s source in the Security and Defense Forces reported that the author of The New York Times article, Thomas Gibbons-Neff, who stated in his article that Kostyantynivka was allegedly hit by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, had previously been repeatedly seen promoting Russian narratives. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://censor.net/ua/news/3444345/po_rynku_v_kostyantynivtsi_6_veresnya_rosiyany_vdaryly_raketoyu_s300_sbu_onovleno\">https://censor.net/ua/news/3444345/po_rynku_v_kostyantynivtsi_6_veresnya_rosiyany_vdaryly_raketoyu_s300_sbu_onovleno</a></p>\n</div>",

You could argue that Western disinterest is what pushed Armenia into forging close ties with Russia and Iran, but that's kind of a pointless chicken-and-egg discussion, IMO. The fact of the matter is that Armenia is in Turkey's backyard (i.e. a hostile NATO ally), Russia (a fair-weather friend, at best) has shown its willingness to \"protect its interests\" in former Soviet states, and Azerbaijan's malicious geopolitical plays have to be tolerated for now.\n\nThis is very reductive, and there's decades (centuries, really) of history, bad blood, and complicated relationships we need to take into account, too. Nagorno-Karabakh is, legally, territory that's recognized as belonging to Azerbaijan, currently occupied by Armenians (ethnic Armenians allied to the Republic of Armenia rather than actual Armenian armed forces). That's already a problem for the West, which prides itself on respecting international law and national sovereignty. Then there's the issue that neither side is really blameless here. While Azerbaijan is the clear aggressor now and also in 2020, both sides engaged in uh, questionable, borderline illegal stuff in the First Karabakh War. This whole thing is much more complicated than \"These guys are Western allies and/or aligned with the West, while the other guys aren't.\" \n\nBut let's say the West throws all of the above out the window and decides it wants to help Armenia. How does that happen, exactly? Neither the UN nor NATO would approve any kind of troop deployment in Armenia, so how do you build a coalition to assist Armenia and do it without openly antagonizing Turkey and Azerbaijan? How do the logistics work, considering Armenia is sandwiched between two hostile states, plus Iran & Georgia?",

It should not be this difficult for you to connect those dots. \n\n>\"Spending so much on defense\" has literally been a topic for three fucking decades.

So long as the issue remains unresolved, there will never be peace between them.\n\nFor almost 30 years, neither side was willing to engage each other in good faith. Azerbaijan wanted the non-NK occupied territories (where the pre-war population was nearly 100% Azeri) returned before discussing the status of NK while seemingly keeping independence off the table. For its part, Armenia refused to return those territories without an agreement on NK's status beforehand. Without these territories, NK would've been surrounded much as it is now. However, Armenia was never serious about giving them back either.\n\nArmenia expelled half a million Azeris from those areas and resettled them with ethnic Armenians. Whole cities were depopulated and lay as abandoned ruins to this day. Combined with the Azeris expelled from Armenia proper, Azerbaijan had an influx of 750k refugees in the early 90s at a time when their pre-war population was only 7 million people. \n\nSimultaneously, Azerbaijan expelled almost their entire population of ethnic Armenians (also about half a million people) and started systematically destroying Armenian cultural heritage sites in Nakhchivan and elsewhere. Many sites were centuries old. \n\nThis is not even taking into account the various war crimes each side committed during the 1990s or the various pogroms and civilian massacres they carried out. \n\nMy point is that neither side should be considered the victim. Armenia was never serious about peacefully resolving the situation when they had the upper hand. Now Azerbaijan is in that position. If Azerbaijan seizes Nagorno-Karabakh, much of the 150k Armenias living there would leave even if they weren't expelled by Azerbaijan. Either way, it would be a tragedy; but it could be the last tragedy in a series of tragedies spanning these last three decades.\n\nJust to clarify, I don't want this to happen, nor do I think it should. Armenians have a history in the area dating back to antiquity, and it should be protected. \n\nStrategically, if Azerbaijan does capture Nagorno-Karabakh they could kiss any prospects of land access to Nakhchivan goodbye. Despite the rhetoric, I don't see any significant incursions into Southern Armenia as likely, and capturing NK would remove any potential for Armenian cooperation on the issue. Even if Russia is currently unable to defend Armenia under their CSTO obligations, invading Armenia itself would be a far harder fight than the last campaign and carry a heavy cost that would not be worth the marginal benefits direct access to Nakhchivan would provide.

                "body": "> Ukraine wanting to sell grain in the EU in contravention of regulations against flooding the market with cheaper non-local product\n\nThis is incorrect. The EU as a whole banned grain imports from Ukraine until September 15, in order to give time to transit countries to come up with a solution. Hungary (ostensibly anti-Ukraine), Poland and Slovakia (that have elections coming up soon) did nothing - while Romania and Bulgaria made a deal - and imposed an unilateral ban in contravention of EU rules and free trade regulations. This is why you have literally the rest of the EU, siding with Ukraine on this. Ukraine could have handled it better, but let's not pretend Poland did not try to screw them over expecting Kyiv to let it slide (and for electoral purposes). As someone said, agriculture remains one of the few remaining valuable exports to Ukraine. \n\nRegarding the 'Ukraine being ungrateful' narrative, personally I am uncomfortable with it. Poland provided humanitarian, military and diplomatic support to Kyiv from Day 1. However, Ukraine should also act in its own interests, especially - and I emphasize - considering that they are supported by the rest of the EU on this matter. Charity should not become blackmail, or it is no longer charity. Let's also not forget that in July Poland tried to unload on Ukraine excess poultry produced not in standard with EU regulations, that were deemed unsuitable for consumption due to traces of Newcastle disease.",
