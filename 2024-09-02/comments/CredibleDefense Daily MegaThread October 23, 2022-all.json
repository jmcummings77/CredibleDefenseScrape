If we're promising catastrophic consequences in public, then we're promising catastrophic consequences in private too. But the fact of the matter is Ukraine is not under the NATO nuclear umbrella. Threatening a nuclear response to use in Ukraine would be an abysmally poor strategy.\n\n>I also think you are missing that hybrid warfare is already ongoing with NATO.\n\nNone of this kind of chicannery is particularly new, barring the pipeline. Russia has been waging this kind of hybrid warfare against NATO for decades now. Spying, cyberwarfare, information warfare, this is all par for the course and members of NATO know that.\n\n>Poland doubts article 5 due to structural interest of France/Germany and underwhelming response in the first few months of war\n\nDo you have evidence for this claim? Because frankly this conflict has reinvigorated NATO and the concept of Article Five in ways that we haven't seen since the end of the Cold War. In March, Biden was in Poland reaffirming the \"sacred commitment\" of the US to Article 5. We announced that we are building a new military base there as of August. This points to a strong and continued resolve to support Poland and NATO as a whole. Poland is not stocking up on weapons because it doubts US resolve, it's stocking up on weapons because A. they're paranoid about Russia and Belarus (rightly so) which makes it prudent to do so and B. They know that in the event of a hot war with Russia (god forbid), they will be right on the front line. Plus, Poland is clearly making a push to increase their value to NATO by increasing their arsenal. They know that they will get prestige and positive treatment if they serve as NATO's shield against Russia in this new security environment. None of the discussion of Poland's place in NATO or Poland's concerns really reinforces how Ukraine is a failure of NATO nuclear deterrence. Instead, the fact that Russia is not lobbing cruise missiles into Poland right now to interdict training and supply lines should be a pretty obvious example of NATO nuclear deterrence working. The same thing applies to the Baltics. They have been worried since their independence. I spoke with the Foreign Minister of Lithuania at a talk in 2015 and she was worried then. They are right to be concerned, because a Russian invasion will come for them and do great damage to their cities and people, but they also know that NATO is there to support them and frankly is the only thing guaranteeing their survival. As I said above, there's no signs the US is wavering on its commitment to NATO. As with Poland, their fears are not indicative of the failure of NATO nuclear deterrence.\n\n>Poland has also recently requested participation in nuclear sharing but it was promptly denied.\n\nWhich was the right decision. The US already has nuclear weapons scattered across Europe, US nukes in Poland does not make the country any safer, and the US rightly has no desire to spread its nuclear arsenal out any more than it has to.\n\n>There is also a separate discussion on success of Russian deterrence.\n\nRussia is being deterred and NATO is being deterred. This is how deterrence has worked since Russia got the bomb. It's a two way street. Russia is not expanding the war to NATO, the US is not sending certain equipment to Ukraine among other decisions. Remember that all of Putin's nuclear threats have been explicitly directed at the West, not at Ukraine itself. Also, you cite the US not drawing specific red lines, but as I already said, they've sent those messages in private and, furthermore, strategic ambiguity is a key piece of nuclear deterrence. This is why Russia is also not laying out a lot of specific red lines.\n\n>Actions matter, not words or pieces of paper.\n\nI'll be honest, I'm genuinely curious what you desire to see here? The US has mustered a massive coalition to keep Ukraine, a country that was barely a security partner, afloat economically and militarily. With US backing, NATO is providing the products of the best intelligence agencies in the world to assist Ukraine's war effort. NATO is waging a diplomatic campaign against Russia. NATO shows no signs of pulling its support. They are not telling Ukraine to stop. They are supportive of Ukraine's goals and Ukraine's independence. What's more, they have willingly chosen to put themselves on a dangerous course in order to provide for Ukrainian freedom. And Europe is definitely suffering for it economically, the US as well. So what do you want? Would you like the US to rattle its nuclear saber irresponsibly like Russia? Shall we have conversations legitimizing the usage of nuclear weapons? Is stooping to their level somehow going to benefit Ukraine? More weapons? Those are coming non-stop. You may think the deterrence is all that's stopping the US from sending things like ATACMS and Abrams, but we know for a fact it is not.\n\nAll in all, you have thoroughly failed to convince me that US nuclear deterrence is not working as it should: *protecting the allies under our nuclear umbrella from the aggression of other nuclear states.*",

Russian military strategists have been normalizing the use of tactical nuclear weapons \\~\\~ since 2015 and common believe is Western nuclear deterrence won't apply to such weapons. Deployment is a matter of time as Ukraine will continue winning the war. Then you will stand shocked and ask yourself 'how could I miss this, bbbuuttt nuclear deterrence'. You'd equally shocked if Ukraine had fallen in Feb and Russian would be amassing troops on Lithuania/Estonia/Latvia border as I write this comment.\n\nOn article 5, again you refer to words while reality are major defence purchases from outside of Europe, revision of strategic use of armed forces and initial discussions of military alliance with Ukraine post war. Poland was shocked with German/France response when the war started (they are not reliable allies as it's a common belief USA strong armed them into support) and it became clear support might come only if it can hold on it's own. With USA potentially reducing their involvement in Europe and are encouraging Poland for this type of action. It has very little to do with being valuable member of NATO while Germans haven't meet their 2% GDP defence spending for decades. It's about distrust in French/Germans involvement in transatlantic alliance and continentalist notions ever present in these states.\n\nBiden speech was met with disappointment as well. No clear deterrence message, not moving of substantial forces to Baltic states nor addressing nuclear threats. Private channels you constantly refer to are not credible at all. Clear public messaging and public commitment is the key to success and USA' credibility in this matter as Russians understand only strength. With America's alliance closely watching.\n\nSure, now sanctions are in place, West is united (for now) mostly due to savage Russian brutality, some weapons are flowing but the beginnings were rough. Major lesson learned was aid will only come if you're strong enough to survive after much deliberation and USA with direct neighbors are the only trustworthy allies in the time of need (Balts are definitely strong enough).  And the war is still ongoing with nuclear strikes threat rising with every dying mobilized soldier.\n\nWhat I'd like to see is more HIMARS with ATACMS, F-16 aircraft with call of volunteers to pilot them, leopard 2 tanks, NASAMS air def in numbers and more self-propelled howitzer with large quantity of ammo. Tens of thousands of additional NATO soldiers deployed in Baltic states/Poland to force Russia to take them into account and NATO announced that it's ready to strike Russian position in Ukraine if Russia decides to use nuclear weapons. Stop trying to deescalate while clearly it doesn't work but match Russian in their gambit.\n\nIt's what will end this war and every single expert on Russia I know of advises the same. Even former Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev supports this, but no, you of course know better what is enough. Paper credibility/deterrence that not only failed to prevent the war, but also fails to end it.\n\nPS. Talking about Poland/Balts being 'paranoid' in the face of largest war in Europe, war crimes/russification/displacement literally happening in front of our eyes and ultimatum given to NATO by Putin to withdrawn before the war is pure silliness and lack of understanding what is unfolding (or was to unfold). What else do you need to say it's not 'paranoid' but actually realistic approach? They were correct in their assessment of Russia from the very beginning. Not sure from where this patronizing approach comes from, you can do better.",

And the war is still ongoing with nuclear strikes threat rising with every dying mobilized soldier.</p>\n\n<p>What I&#39;d like to see is more HIMARS with ATACMS, F-16 aircraft with call of volunteers to pilot them, leopard 2 tanks, NASAMS air def in numbers and more self-propelled howitzer with large quantity of ammo. Tens of thousands of additional NATO soldiers deployed in Baltic states/Poland to force Russia to take them into account and NATO announced that it&#39;s ready to strike Russian position in Ukraine if Russia decides to use nuclear weapons. Stop trying to deescalate while clearly it doesn&#39;t work but match Russian in their gambit.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s what will end this war and every single expert on Russia I know of advises the same. Even former Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev supports this, but no, you of course know better what is enough. Paper credibility/deterrence that not only failed to prevent the war, but also fails to end it.</p>\n\n<p>PS. Talking about Poland/Balts being &#39;paranoid&#39; in the face of largest war in Europe, war crimes/russification/displacement literally happening in front of our eyes and ultimatum given to NATO by Putin to withdrawn before the war is pure silliness and lack of understanding what is unfolding (or was to unfold). What else do you need to say it&#39;s not &#39;paranoid&#39; but actually realistic approach? They were correct in their assessment of Russia from the very beginning. Not sure from where this patronizing approach comes from, you can do better.</p>\n</div>",

It takes multiple actors on the ground and in the air working closely together for 24 hours a day.  \n\n>\u201cThe last few weeks were very busy, very exhausting for us,\u201d Juice said of the air war against the drones, dozens of which Russia has deployed daily.  \n \n>\u201cIt\u2019s still very, very difficult to shoot them down.\u201d  \n\n>The war in Ukraine is now fought in two mostly separate arenas: on the ground in the south and east, where the Ukrainian Army has the upper hand, and in the air, where Russia is firing long-range missiles and deploying the exploding Iranian-made drones to cripple the electrical and heating infrastructure in Ukrainian cities in the hopes of demoralizing the population.  \n \n>Since Russia began terrorizing Ukrainian cities in September with the drones, Ukraine has turned its focus to an intense counter-drone strategy, made up on the fly but often surprisingly successful.  \n \n>Currently, it consists of three layers of protection: fighter jets that patrol around the clock; ground-fired antiaircraft missiles; and teams of soldiers with machine guns who try to shoot the drones down as they fly past.  \n  \n>The hardest part is simply finding the drones, Juice said. On radar, the small, plodding drones can be confused with migrating birds or trucks on a highway. Ground controllers identify potential targets and direct jets to intercept them, but often the pilots come up empty.  \n \n>Despite the hurdles, the Ukrainian military is now routinely shooting down more than 70 percent of the Shahed-136 drones Russia purchased from Iran in August, Yuriy Sak, an adviser to the Ukrainian minister of defense, said in an interview.  \n\n>Ukraine shot down the first such drone in the country\u2019s east on Sept. 13 and has since downed at least 237, the Ukrainian military said in a statement last week. \u201cWe are trying to quickly adapt to the new reality,\u201d Mr. Sak said.  \n  \n>Exploding drones are a rapidly emerging class of weapons that are proliferating around the world and likely to become a staple of modern armed conflicts, military analysts say. That is a point that Ukrainian officials have been making in seeking air defense assistance from their allies. If Ukraine can learn to shoot the drones down with its three-pronged effort, allied countries\u2019 militaries could reap the benefits of this hard-won experience, Mr. Sak said.  \n \n>There have been notable successes.  \n\n>One Ukrainian MiG pilot won folk hero status in Ukraine this month for shooting down five Iranian Shahed-136 drones over the central Ukrainian city of Vinnytsia, only to be forced to eject after crashing into the debris of the last one. The pilot, Karaya \u2014 who identified himself by only his nickname, according to military policy \u2014 told the local news media afterward, \u201cWithin a short period of time, we are adapting to this kind of weapon and are starting to destroy it successfully.\u201d  \n\n>After colliding with the airborne debris, he said, Karaya steered his MiG away from Vinnytsia and ejected. The jet crashed into houses in an outlying area, but injured nobody on the ground. Karaya later visited the site to apologize.  \n\n>\u201cI visited the scene, said I was sorry for the discomfort I caused the residents and thanked them for their steel nerves,\u201d he wrote on Instagram, saying he showed up in his tattered uniform, missing epaulets. He joked that it was a violation of military protocol. \u201cLost them while leaving the office,\u201d he wrote.  \n\n>While fighter jets have been effective against Iranian drones, said Yurii Ignat, a Ukrainian Air Force spokesman, the approach is costly because of its use of air-to-air missiles. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating that we must hit these drones with expensive missiles,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat else can we do? This is the reality now.\u201d  \n\n>Before Russia\u2019s arsenal included the Iranian-made drones, beginning in August, Ukraine had an edge in drone warfare.  \n\n>Ukrainian soldiers along the front line flew off-the-shelf commercial drones to spot targets and drop grenades on Russian trenches. The United States has supplied Ukraine with its Switchblade drones, a type of exploding drone. Ukraine has also deployed Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 drones \u2014 larger, longer-range craft that surveil the battlefield and fire guided missiles.  \n\n>In August, the United States promised that within the next nine months it would deliver to Ukraine a small, compact counter-drone missile system that could be mounted on the back of an ordinary pickup truck. The so-called Vampire system is a newly developed anti-drone technology that can reach out farther than a machine gun, but is portable enough to be driven quickly into the path of incoming drones.  \n\n>After a drone swarm attack on Kyiv on Monday, Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, appealed to Israel for air defense weapons. The plea was rebuffed by Israel\u2019s minister of defense, Benny Gantz, largely because Israel depends on Russian cooperation for the Israeli Air Force to conduct raids in Syria. Israel, he said, would provide early warning systems, but not air defense weapons.  \n\n>Mr. Sak, the adviser to the Ukrainian defense minister, said Israel could be missing an opportunity to hone its tactics in facing down threats in its own territory by assisting in the counter-drone efforts now underway in Ukraine.  \n\n>\u201cThese Iranian drones that are hitting Ukrainian cities were not developed, not meant for Ukraine,\u201d Mr. Sak said. \u201cThey were developed as a mass capability to strike Israel. They are using Ukraine as a testing ground, to see weaknesses, to perfect them, and sooner or later they will use them against Israel.\u201d  \n\n>A Ukrainian official, speaking off the record, has said Israel has provided intelligence useful for targeting the Iranian drones.  \n  \n>The drones, when in flight, also have a distinctive buzz from their small engines, which has proved a vulnerability.  \n\n>In Kyiv, three policemen shot down one drone with their Kalashnikov rifles after hearing the buzz, described by witnesses as sounding like a chain-saw engine, and then seeing the triangular weapon fly toward them over rooftops.  \n \n>\u201cThere was very little time to make a decision,\u201d said Sgt. Oleksandr Kravchuk, who is a shooting instructor with the police department.  \n\n>He said he fired all 30 rounds in his magazine, trying to aim in front of the craft to account for its speed in flight. The drone veered off course and crashed, blowing up about 75 yards from where he was standing, Sergeant Kravchuk said in an interview.  \n\n>\u201cWe heard it, we saw it, then we opened fire,\u201d he said.",

The United States has supplied Ukraine with its Switchblade drones, a type of exploding drone. Ukraine has also deployed Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 drones \u2014 larger, longer-range craft that surveil the battlefield and fire guided missiles.  </p>\n\n<p>In August, the United States promised that within the next nine months it would deliver to Ukraine a small, compact counter-drone missile system that could be mounted on the back of an ordinary pickup truck. The so-called Vampire system is a newly developed anti-drone technology that can reach out farther than a machine gun, but is portable enough to be driven quickly into the path of incoming drones.  </p>\n\n<p>After a drone swarm attack on Kyiv on Monday, Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, appealed to Israel for air defense weapons. The plea was rebuffed by Israel\u2019s minister of defense, Benny Gantz, largely because Israel depends on Russian cooperation for the Israeli Air Force to conduct raids in Syria. Israel, he said, would provide early warning systems, but not air defense weapons.  </p>\n\n<p>Mr. Sak, the adviser to the Ukrainian defense minister, said Israel could be missing an opportunity to hone its tactics in facing down threats in its own territory by assisting in the counter-drone efforts now underway in Ukraine.  </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThese Iranian drones that are hitting Ukrainian cities were not developed, not meant for Ukraine,\u201d Mr. Sak said. \u201cThey were developed as a mass capability to strike Israel. They are using Ukraine as a testing ground, to see weaknesses, to perfect them, and sooner or later they will use them against Israel.\u201d  </p>\n\n<p>A Ukrainian official, speaking off the record, has said Israel has provided intelligence useful for targeting the Iranian drones.  </p>\n\n<p>The drones, when in flight, also have a distinctive buzz from their small engines, which has proved a vulnerability.  </p>\n\n<p>In Kyiv, three policemen shot down one drone with their Kalashnikov rifles after hearing the buzz, described by witnesses as sounding like a chain-saw engine, and then seeing the triangular weapon fly toward them over rooftops.  </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThere was very little time to make a decision,\u201d said Sgt. Oleksandr Kravchuk, who is a shooting instructor with the police department.  </p>\n\n<p>He said he fired all 30 rounds in his magazine, trying to aim in front of the craft to account for its speed in flight. The drone veered off course and crashed, blowing up about 75 yards from where he was standing, Sergeant Kravchuk said in an interview.  </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe heard it, we saw it, then we opened fire,\u201d he said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Corbyn isn't relevant to the current Labour leadership even though I was a fan of his non defence related policies. I wouldn't expect any change under the current Labour Party in terms of Ukraine support as its a pretty easy political win to support Ukraine.

It's in Russia's best interests to try and tell the West that Ukraine is dangerous/untrustworthy. A Russian dirty bomb use would achieve nothing but Russia getting caught using a dirty bomb. These things are identifiable and not effective militarily. It could be pretext for escalation, but I'm not sure what, considering they're already missile striking everything.

Russia could be playing off recent reporting that indicates the West and Ukraine aren&#39;t always on the same page with Ukraine&#39;s more fantastical plots (Dugina, the Kerch bridge strike, and recently a piece in the New Yorker noting that the Ukrainians straight up lied to the US about their defense plans at the start of the war). It&#39;s in Russia&#39;s best interests to try and tell the West that Ukraine is dangerous/untrustworthy. A Russian dirty bomb use would achieve nothing but Russia getting caught using a dirty bomb. These things are identifiable and not effective militarily. It could be pretext for escalation, but I&#39;m not sure what, considering they&#39;re already missile striking everything. Maybe an assassination campaign?</p>\n</div>",

Mao sailed through most of his career appealing to nationalism even as economic catastrophe mounted. Xiaoping saw that nationalism was losing its grip as the original ideologically strong Mao generation was dying and was thus quick to open up avenues of growth, improving the lives of citizens a lot and allowing the West in. \n\nXi has relied on unparalleled economic growth to implement unparalleled authoritarianism and surveillance. But as the growth does down, which he sees coming in any case, the appeal to nationalism must be made stronger. That\u2019s why the integration of Taiwan has been made a necessary aim, and the constant sword rattling with the West. \n\nThe West on the other hand, with its new export controls regime, has kneecapped the growth in China further. This naturally means a rise in nationalism is needed to keep the population putting up with the isolationist, authoritarian policies. \n\nChinese foreign policy usually works on a time scale larger than what, say, Europe is used to - having gone from a world war to a generally United front in a couple of decades. \n\nChina is planning for 2060 too. How they\u2019ll hold up the nationalist part so far is anyone\u2019s guess but that\u2019s the reason Taiwan is a hot topic these days. \n\nThe third possibility, considered the least plausible, is a fall of authoritarianism itself. That will not happen under Xi, and the tempo is in favour of increasing authoritarianism. \n\nBut stranger things have happened.",

Xiaoping saw that nationalism was losing its grip as the original ideologically strong Mao generation was dying and was thus quick to open up avenues of growth, improving the lives of citizens a lot and allowing the West in. </p>\n\n<p>Xi has relied on unparalleled economic growth to implement unparalleled authoritarianism and surveillance. But as the growth does down, which he sees coming in any case, the appeal to nationalism must be made stronger. That\u2019s why the integration of Taiwan has been made a necessary aim, and the constant sword rattling with the West. </p>\n\n<p>The West on the other hand, with its new export controls regime, has kneecapped the growth in China further. This naturally means a rise in nationalism is needed to keep the population putting up with the isolationist, authoritarian policies. </p>\n\n<p>Chinese foreign policy usually works on a time scale larger than what, say, Europe is used to - having gone from a world war to a generally United front in a couple of decades. </p>\n\n<p>China is planning for 2060 too. How they\u2019ll hold up the nationalist part so far is anyone\u2019s guess but that\u2019s the reason Taiwan is a hot topic these days. </p>\n\n<p>The third possibility, considered the least plausible, is a fall of authoritarianism itself. That will not happen under Xi, and the tempo is in favour of increasing authoritarianism. </p>\n\n<p>But stranger things have happened.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "Has anyone here been on the inside of a NATO/US or general military decision-making group when it comes to something like formulating a plan to deal with the Shahed drones?  \nI have read all of the commentary here for the last week about different air defense systems and it strikes me as very linear thinking but of course that probably means that's how these kinds of issues are handled. The problem is that there have so far not been any satisfactory solutions that I have seen generated from this linear approach, as these systems are one by one discounted here based on cost, effectiveness, time-to-operation, manpower requirements, etc.\n\n  \nThe other main solution advocated in this forum has been to provide Ukraine with better offensive weapons in retaliation, which users here describe as escalation. The main example being the ATACMS. The reasoning on either side of this issue has been discussed in detail.  \nI don't understand why there isn't as much discussion of deterring Iran.

        "body": "Some clarifications about the dirty bomb story:\n\n1. A dirty bomb is not the equivalent of a nuclear weapon. Pavel Podvig notes that they could contaminate an area of a couple hundred square meters at most. These are not militarily viable weapons. The point of the dirty bomb is to contaminate an area and make people sick. More than anything else it is a psychological weapon, hence why we assume terrorists would do this. Furthermore, the signature of a dirty bomb is distinct. It would be a relatively straightforward task to determine where the nuclear material originated from and therefore establish responsibility. No one could mistake a dirty bomb detonation for a nuclear warhead detonation and vice versa. Dirty bombs also do not immediately justify or necessitate a nuclear response, given how small and relatively not impactful they are. See Cheryl Rofer talking about them here: [https://twitter.com/CherylRofer/status/1584286611621105665](https://twitter.com/CherylRofer/status/1584286611621105665)\n2. Per the RIA Novosti article that appears to be the driver behind a lot of this chatter (Mediazona, an opposition news outlet in Russia, claims this article was discussed during the calls), there are two narratives here. The **Dirty Bomb** narrative is not that Ukrainians are planning to use a dirty bomb on Russia. Rather, they are planning to detonate a dirty bomb in Ukrainian territory and blame it on Russia to destroy Russia's reputation/support and justify more weaponry. This is similar to a claim made on state TV earlier this week that Ukraine was planning on detonating a \"nuclear device\" in Mykolaiv to frame Russia. In short, Russia is supposedly concerned about getting accused of a crime it says it didn't commit. That doesn't preclude a Russian false flag, but it is not implying a nuclear attack on Russia. That's left to the second narrative. The **Nuclear Weapon** narrative is coming from both RIA Novosti and Interfax, stating that anonymous Russian sources say Ukraine is secretly building nuclear weapons in Chernobyl and will get the parts to actually create the weapons from the United Kingdom. So obviously bullshit.\n3. There are lots of reasons for Russia to be making this claim and these calls right now. Setting the groundwork for a false flag is just one of them. Obviously, that's the most alarming conclusion, so it is getting the most chatter on social media, but it's entirely possible that this is a disinfo op or cover for increasing negotiations. The fact of the matter is that a dirty bomb helps nobody in this situation, especially in the scenario that Russia is proposing. This is not something that Ukraine would conscious nor is it something that Russia \\*should\\* conscious. A good thread from pwnallthethings (who despite his name and pfp is actually a genuine expert) covers it here: [https://twitter.com/pwnallthethings/status/1584266760709996544](https://twitter.com/pwnallthethings/status/1584266760709996544)  \n\n\nEdit: If you are concerned that Shoigu is reaching out to only the people with nukes, don't be. Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands store just as many nukes as Turkey and he didn't call them.",

They are not suddenly going to upend their decades-old policy of resisting nukes in the Middle East, including supporting sanctions against Iran in the Security Council and throwing its weight behind the JCPOA (with the nuclear agreement still being dependent on Russian cooperation, as it requires surplus of enriched Iranian uranium being flown to Russia and Russian help in downgrading Iranian enrichment facilities).\n\nProviding nukes to Iran means overturning the balance of power in the Middle East, with Russia suddenly coming at odds with the likes of Israel and Saudi. And they still need the support of the likes of Saudi, as we've recently seen with OPEC production cuts. In addition, Iran becoming a nuclear power means other countries in the region going nuclear as well, and the prospect of Russia facing more nuclear powers on its southern borders (including probably Turkey) is not exactly a desired geopolitical reality.\n\nAny payment of Russia to Iran notwithstanding, it is far likelier that Russia has successfully made a case within Iran's power circles that they are in dire need of support and that they're in reality fighting the combined strength of the entire western bloc. The same western bloc that not long ago tried to upend Iran's influence in Syria when they backed all kinds of rebel groups, and the same bloc that still enforces the stringiest sanctions against it. And the Russians probably don't need to remind the Iranians that they honored Iran's plea for assistance back when Soleimani flew to Moscow to request its intervention in Syria.\n\nAs an Iranian, when your friend is in help, you don't haggle over payments when your support is required.

Prospects that Russia is doing very poorly at by the way.</p>\n\n<p>Its anyone&#39;s guess on how that will go. No one gas a genie bottle here. War could last another year...or another two years or possibly even longer, but unless Russia gets a lot smarter and mobilizes their entire society like Ukraine has I just don&#39;t see them being able to flip the tide. I also do not see remotely the same potential for Russia to do the latter because they are the ones invading someone for no good reason. Most of their people don&#39;t really care about it especially not enough to go volunteer or fight themselves. Ukraine meanwhile has basically all of civil society behind their soldiers.</p>\n</div>",

No amount of UA zeal or aggression gets through that, it's a meat grinder affair of costly frontal assaults unless somewhere the Russians expose a temporary weakness that the Ukrainians can exploit, which has happened before and will likely again.

To accomplish that, the UAF didn't create some massive field army sized force in their strategic reserve and secretly send them along with a massive supply allotment to the Donbas, they used a handful of local brigades who had been fighting there for months fighting, who were pulled off the line temporarily, moved to an assembly area, given a short time to reconstitute and prep, and then launched on an offensive against a known Russian weak point that was begging to be attacked.

Russia will never truly lose every tank (I assume at least a few hundred will be held in reserve for Russia) so as it approaches the ceiling for losses it will become flatter and flatter.\n\nI also think Russia has artificially inflated the part of the curve where we are now, the loss rate has remained steep because now we are seeing a dozen T-62 losses over the mere span of days. Once they are no longer able to inflate their losses (which is quite an incredible thing to say) with T-62s then we will see the curve begin to cool off.\n\nYes, right now the log appears linear but it is not. This same function we are seeing right now will be captured using a log as well. So your function should be f(n) = ln(x), basically some natural log to approximate the actual flow. It can also be viewed as a limit where the final number you have judged to be as the total number of Russian tanks is an asymptote as Russian losses approach... infinity. The line of losses will always approach but never quite touch that final threshold.",
                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I love this, but the annoying thing about it is that it to me it will almost certainly not be a linear scale, but more <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithmic_scale#/media/File:Logarithmic_Scales-mkII.svg\">logarithmic</a> as X increases linearly, Y will likely flatten out and the losses will slow. Russia will never truly lose every tank (I assume at least a few hundred will be held in reserve for Russia) so as it approaches the ceiling for losses it will become flatter and flatter.</p>\n\n<p>I also think Russia has artificially inflated the part of the curve where we are now, the loss rate has remained steep because now we are seeing a dozen T-62 losses over the mere span of days. Once they are no longer able to inflate their losses (which is quite an incredible thing to say) with T-62s then we will see the curve begin to cool off.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, right now the log appears linear but it is not. This same function we are seeing right now will be captured using a log as well. So your function should be f(n) = ln(x), basically some natural log to approximate the actual flow. It can also be viewed as a limit where the final number you have judged to be as the total number of Russian tanks is an asymptote as Russian losses approach... infinity. The line of losses will always approach but never quite touch that final threshold.</p>\n</div>",
