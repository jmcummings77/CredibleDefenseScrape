I'll say this: intel services goofed Afghanistan bad but got the Russian invasion right, so we should at least consider it credible that the nuclear threat is heightened.\n\nWe have to consider and acknowledge that Russia's nuclear arsenal, like America's is mostly sitting in a stockpile. Besides silos, subs, and mobile ICBMs (all strategic, not tactical), Russia has not deployed its vast arsenal--yet. They have rough parity with the US in terms of deployed nukes.\n\nHow then, could Russia use nukes, and how would we know it's coming? Well, there are three main scenarios that I see:\n\n1) Russia forgoes using a tactical weapon and instead launches from a silo to Ukraine. Ukraine would have seconds and at most minutes to respond. The rest of the world would likely only know after the bang. This would entail an 800kt weapon being detonated in the air above a major city, destroying or otherwise damaging everything within a few km radius. Little radiation, but lots of damage.\n\n2) Russia secrets out a single tactical nuke from storage and attach it to a launcher and then deploys it against a Ukrainian brigade. The brigade would be destroyed or heavily damaged, and if it is a groundburst, there would be significant radiation. We would only know if US intelligence is able to pick up on such a small cargo existing one of the known storage locations.\n\n3) Russia openly mobilizes its nuclear arsenal. This is the US equivalent of Defcon 2. Bombers are strapped with nukes, all stockpiled weapons are armed, and the world would stand on precipice. \n\nOf all the above, I rank them in terms of plausibility: 3, 1, 2. The third option is escalatory, but also leaves options for deescalation. It also would give Russia a time-limited edge, depending on when America also mobilizes. It would limit America's response, if, say, they knew any American retaliation to a Russian attack on Ukraine would lead to a credible nuclear exchange with Russia.\n\n1 is a shock tactic with limited military purposes (depends where they strike). This is dangerous for Russia, as it would invite a NATO non-nuclear response, not to mention the severe blowback of killing hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians, many of whom likely have family in Russia.\n\n2 is noncredible. There is no military value in nuking a single brigade. NATO's response would be the same as 1, and by secreting out only a single nuke, Russia would only worsen their situation.\n\nSo 3 it is. But this option is expensive, time-consuming, and risky. If both Russia and America move to that position, where 5000 nukes are pointed from each side to the other, we would stand on a knife's edge.\n\nFurther, the pinnacle philosophical question of this war has always been: does might make right? Does nuclear power mean that the good laws of men be discarded and replaced instead with the awesome power of the atom? It's a question that all societies have struggled with. \n\nConsider: by what right did Britain and France conquer Africa and India, if not the right of gunpowder and steel? The pull of our ancestors pulls us towards conquest and dominion. But we know a better world without violence is possible. A world of equal harmony and trade, of peace and understanding, as enshrined in the founding charter of the United Nations. That vision was shattered by the greed of men on both sides during the cold war, but I think it can return. \n\nIf Russia does use nuclear weapons and does conquer Ukraine, then the UN is a dead letter like the League of Nations. We are back to the age of conquest and tyranny, and God help all those who stand in the way of the mighty. I pray that humanity survives the coming conflicts.",

I think the chances are low but not zero.\n\nHistorically our side genuinely considered using nuclear weapons to break a logjam in both Korea and Vietnam. And the only time they've actually been used was to force a surrender of an enemy that seemingly could only be defeated otherwise through a ruinously expensive conventional offensive (Japan). I think we can conclude that Russia either already has started similar thinking, or that they will in the future.\n\nThe idea that NATO would definitely have to join the war effort directly if nuclear arms were used, although it's become all the rage in the past week, frankly lacks credibility. \n\nThat said, the problem for Putin is that nukes aren't really a magic cure-all for his problems, even if NATO doesn't intervene. I don't think Ukraine will surrender over the use of one small nuclear device on a battlefield, so he'll almost certainly have to use many, and/or nuke cities, at which point the attempt to limit the nuclear war to \"just one bomb\" has already failed. He'll still have to control any territory that's been taken -- Russia hasn't even got to the counterinsurgency phase yet, which is where most modern wars falter.\n\nAnd above all he'll have to reckon with the post-war world. He'll have to consider the likelihood that the response from NATO is to beef up its defenses in all existing NATO countries and very likely station troops to defend post-war Ukraine. At which point what have the nukes accomplished other than further isolating Russia? All of those are things that would happen if he offered a ceasefire today.",

I think we can conclude that Russia either already has started similar thinking, or that they will in the future.</p>\n\n<p>The idea that NATO would definitely have to join the war effort directly if nuclear arms were used, although it&#39;s become all the rage in the past week, frankly lacks credibility. </p>\n\n<p>That said, the problem for Putin is that nukes aren&#39;t really a magic cure-all for his problems, even if NATO doesn&#39;t intervene. I don&#39;t think Ukraine will surrender over the use of one small nuclear device on a battlefield, so he&#39;ll almost certainly have to use many, and/or nuke cities, at which point the attempt to limit the nuclear war to &quot;just one bomb&quot; has already failed. He&#39;ll still have to control any territory that&#39;s been taken -- Russia hasn&#39;t even got to the counterinsurgency phase yet, which is where most modern wars falter.</p>\n\n<p>And above all he&#39;ll have to reckon with the post-war world. He&#39;ll have to consider the likelihood that the response from NATO is to beef up its defenses in all existing NATO countries and very likely station troops to defend post-war Ukraine. At which point what have the nukes accomplished other than further isolating Russia? All of those are things that would happen if he offered a ceasefire today.</p>\n</div>",

It's not their first port of call, and orders to retreat are not issued for no reason at all. Modern manuever warfare involves a lot of cut-and-thrust, and Russia will not be able to mount any sort of successful counter-attacks if it does not allow its forces to undertake tactical retreats, to regroup and concentrate force for a counter-attack. It will just end up in strongpoints being completely encircled, as Ukraine bottles up Russian forces that are digging in - leaving forces dispersed and cut-off, and fatally undermining Russian fighting strength. It's simply far, far too large a front for any sort of refusal to retreat to be tactically viable.\n\nWhilst Russia lost a lot of equipment in the Kharkiv counter-offensive, and also (relatively speaking) in its retreat from Kyiv, personnel losses were much lower, and it could have been much worse. If there had been a 'no step back' order in place for those retreats, we wouldn't still have Russian troops in Izium or Hostomel - instead they'd simply have held out there for a few weeks longer, and there'd be much more loss of Russian personnel and materiel. Of course it would cost more Ukrainian lives as well, but it is exceedingly unlikely that a completely encircled force will inflict more damage than it suffers.\n\nYou would see a slowdown in the rate of any advance - and in certain scenarios that may well be useful. For instance, I think it was Izyum where the Russians fought a seemingly well-executed (at least comparatively) delaying action in the recent Kharkiv counter-offensive, allowing the majority of Russian forces to retreat to new defensive lines. However, that's very context specific, and if every strongpoint tries to do that, you'll just end up with tens of thousands of troops split between pockets deep behind enemy lines, which can then be rolled-up one by one, likely taking extreme numbers of casualties.",

He was targeted for US sanctions, along with several other leading businessmen close to Russian President Vladimir Putin, following the invasion of Ukraine, and also in earlier round in 2018.\n\n>Deripaska, the majority shareholder of Russian metals giant En+ Group International. He has a net worth of around $3 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index.\n\n>\u201cIn the wake of Russia\u2019s unjust and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, I promised the American people that the Justice Department would work to hold accountable those who break our laws and threaten our national security,\u201d Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. \u201cToday\u2019s charges demonstrate we are keeping that promise.\u201d \n\n>Though Deripaska isn\u2019t in the US, he has property in the country that could be subject to forfeiture. In the indictment, prosecutors list US assets including a Wells Fargo account, a Washington mansion and two Manhattan townhouses, one in the West Village and the other on the Upper East Side. The Washington mansion and West Village townhouse were searched by the FBI last October.\n\n>A spokesman for Deripaska didn\u2019t immediately respond to an email request for comment.\n\n>One of the alleged sanction conspirators, New Jersey resident and naturalized US citizen Olga Shriki was arrested Thursday for her alleged participation in the scheme, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement. Shriki helped Deripaska receive the money from a $3 million sale of a music studio in 2019, according to prosecutors. \n\n>The government said Deripaska\u2019s girlfriend, Ekaterina Olegovna Voronina, was separately charged with lying to Department of Homeland Security agents while trying to enter the US to give birth earlier this year. Voronina entered the US to give birth to another of Deripaska\u2019s children in 2020.\n\n>In the sanctions case, Prosecutors claim Deripaska illegally used the US financial system to maintain three luxury properties in the country.

The legal entity has a few hundred employees and pays hundreds of millions of rubles in taxes to the treasury every year. The businessman himself actively helps the front with supplies, he has invested about 10-15 million roubles in drones, infrared cameras, communications, armored cars and uniforms since the USO was launched (we hesitate even to ask about a specific amount). \n\n> We know the man personally, his help in supplying soldiers on the front line is invaluable to us (and to the soldiers even more so). \n\n> Now the situation: from among his staff, about ten or eleven workers have fallen under the first wave of mobilization. No one is running, everyone has the right attitude, everyone wants to defend their homeland, the entrepreneur understands this and helps equip them. Ten to eleven people seems like a small number for a large sole proprietorship, but: \n\n> The legal entity, of course, has taken out loans for its activities, and some of the equipment it uses is leased. In this situation, the downtime of a conditional crane, whose operator has been mobilized, probably means the failure of a deadline for the execution of a state contract, because it is difficult to find a quick replacement for the retiring personnel in the market (more than one company will face the same problem now or has already faced it - and personnel become worth their weight in gold). For the backbone state company, it is at least a failure to meet deadlines, and for the contractor, anything is possible, up to and including bankruptcy. \n\n> At stake are several hundred million rubles in annual taxes to the treasury, several hundred jobs, and a government contract in the backbone industry. And the opportunity for one patriotically-minded entrepreneur to continue supplying significant amounts of money to the front lines is also at stake. This case, we believe, is not isolated. \n\n> No one is hysterical, everyone is ready to act within the legal framework, there are several questions: \n\n> - Is it possible to get deferrals on payments of loans and leases for the enterprises, whose employees were subject to mobilization? \n\n> - Is there a clear framework for such deferrals? In theory, they can be asked in different ways: from the volume of tax payments, from the availability of state contracts in the company, and from the number of people employed in the company. Is it possible for a company to get a reservation for employees according to these parameters?\n\n> - can the Ministry of Industry and Trade, for example, issue a memo or instructions (like the Ministry of Defense did on mobilization) for legal entities which in the current conditions face the problem of possible bankruptcy, fulfilling all orders on mobilization of their personnel? \n\n> Dear friends, if you have encountered such questions and know the exact answers, please write to us. \n\n> The topic seems quite serious and urgent to us.",

I posted about this in a megathread around the time the mobilization took place, but it's worth repeating here.   \n\n\nRussians have a particular view about Russia and it's role in history. The closest analogy would be the \"American Exceptionalism\" view some americans have about the US. Russians see themselves as a great nation, the continuation of the Byzantine Empire and as a Third Rome. They admit international laws and regulations exists, but they also hold the opinion that those laws can be bent or broken by great powers when their vital interests are threatened.   \n\n\nWhich leads to the second point, which is about Ukraine. Russia sees Ukraine as being part of its sphere of influence. Not just geopolitical sphere of influence, but also its cultural sphere. Lest we forget, one of the reasons for the first Donbass war in 2014 was the protection of the Russian speaking population inside Ukraine. The idea of Ukraine making sovereign foreign policy decisions on which Russia hasn't agreed to or at the very least hasn't been consulted on is not something the Russians can live with. Ukraine joining NATO is a doomsday scenario for the Russians.   \n\n\nThese views, rightly or wrongly, are held not just by Putin, but a large part of the Russian security establishment and the general Russian population as a whole. Exactly how many, it's hard to tell. But the few polls we do have from Russia seem to indicate a significant approval rating for Putin and for the special military operation in Ukraine. How much those polls can be trusted is a matter of debate, but I don't think they can be dismissed outright.   \n\n\nWhat's even more telling is that most of the criticism we have seen towards Putin from inside Russia wasn't the one we would like to see. Internal critics of Putin are holding him and the security establishment to task for not prosecuting the war as forcefully as they can.  \n\n\nAnd politicians from Romania, Poland and the Baltics have been pointing this out since the war in Georgia in 2008 at the very least, but no one in the West was inclined to listen  to this rethoric because it didn't fit with the liberal internationalist foreign policy agenda that was prevalent in the West at the time.",

Keep the Western public and media talking about nuclear threats to sow disruption. Do not pull nukes out of storage yet, don't want to tip NATO early and solidify support instead of deterring it.\n3. Proceed with annexation. Start funneling troops in LNR/DNR who are in reserve in their provinces to critical frontline junctures, whether they like it or not. Expand mobilization to the populations of newly annexed regions and start pressing them into necessary roles.\n4. Begin constant strikes on Ukrainian critical infrastructure after a suitable warning period. Clear escalation step in response to Ukraine continuing to fight on annexed land.

I don't think Russia can realistically blackmail Ukraine into halting attacks without actually engaging in the most destructive course possible, which naturally they should want to avoid. Rather, I would continue to use nuclear weapons to deter direct Western intervention as a result of annexation because I do really think Russia believes that's a possibility. I am trying to think about it from their perspective. The uncertainty of nuclear weapons use also continues to rattle the cage of NATO in private, if not public. There are benefits to keeping the threats up without specific demands attached, but I would do them constantly as they do now.  \n\n\nRe: PGMs, I don't think anybody really has a good grasp on what Russia has got now. They definitely still have some, almost certainly enough to cause some damage. There are also other sabotage options available. Frankly, just because we haven't seen Russia launch spec ops strikes on vulnerable Ukrainian targets doesn't mean they can't. The Iranian drone influx also adds another strike dimension as well.",

Keep the Western public and media talking about nuclear threats to sow disruption.

Both your elite and your population are willing to accept nuclearisation in Ukraine if it comes to that. Keep your enemies constantly aware that you are willing to escalate and risk far more than they are.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Proceed with annexation. Start funneling troops in LNR/DNR who are in reserve in their provinces to critical frontline junctures, whether they like it or not. Expand mobilization to the populations of newly annexed regions and start pressing them into necessary roles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo. No need to. With your manpower pool now into millions, there is no need to scrape the bottom of the barrel to recruit a few dozen thousand DNR/LNR people. Instead, rearm their regular units, reinforce them from their mobilised units, give them a rest and use them as your spearhead for future offensives. They are the best troops you have.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Begin constant strikes on Ukrainian critical infrastructure after a suitable warning period. Clear escalation step in response to Ukraine continuing to fight on annexed land. Destroy power plants, power lines, water supplies, whatever I can that will inflict maximum suffering on the civilian population without resorting to outright pointless terror bombing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYes. Not as a part of a terror campaign but with clear military objectives. Destroying the Ukrainian power grid significantly degrades the Ukrainian military potential. With the new Iranian kamikaze drones you even have an additional weapon to achieve it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Hold the line and hope for a hard winter across Europe. Continue offering potential deescalatory moves to the West (START negotiations, phone calls, face to face meetings). Assure China and India that I do not intend to use a nuclear weapon right now.\n\nYes. Prepare for an offensive in the spring - after all, you will have a manpower advantage for the first time since the war started instead of being outnumbered 3:1 or worse.\n\nAdditionally, keep constantly negotiating with China. Hope that the USA will continue to antagonise Beijing. Point out to them that you either hang together or hang separately. Acquire semiconductors and other necessary tech from them.

Since Western governments haven\u2019t yet pointed fingers, people start to speculate. Russia isn\u2019t trusted, but it\u2019s hard to fathom for many why they\u2019d blow up their own pipelines. Meanwhile, the US has a much clearer motive. Maybe it hurts European interests, but that hasn\u2019t stopped them before. Neither has the clear illegality of the move. Note that I personally think the US theory to be pretty unlikely, but these are all things I\u2019ve been hearing around me quite a lot for the past few days and they ultimately stem from skepticism towards specifically US foreign policy, not the concept of the West at large.</p>\n</div>",

Why suddenly today is it getting elevated to prominence in the social media sphere? It's certainly an alarming statement. But it was alarming two days ago as well? Just an odd thing that it suddenly popped off now, the day before Putin's speech. Previously I speculated that this was an attempt by Ukraine to play off nuclear fears in order to get more weaponry. After all, anti-rocket systems would help defend against infrastructure missile strikes as well, not just nuclear ones.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>So one weird thing I noticed about this and I&#39;m still trying to puzzle it out. That quote ran two days ago in the Guardian. Why suddenly today is it getting elevated to prominence in the social media sphere? It&#39;s certainly an alarming statement. But it was alarming two days ago as well? Just an odd thing that it suddenly popped off now, the day before Putin&#39;s speech. Previously I speculated that this was an attempt by Ukraine to play off nuclear fears in order to get more weaponry. After all, anti-rocket systems would help defend against infrastructure missile strikes as well, not just nuclear ones. If my idea is the case, is it possible that quote didn&#39;t get enough traction in Western media the first time around?
