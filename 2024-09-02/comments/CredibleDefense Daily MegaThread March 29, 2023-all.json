We also know that in recent months they've started using infantry *extensively* in attacks on heavily fortified Ukrainian positions in Vuhledar, Bakhmut, Soledar, Marinka, and Avdiivka, while also using far less longrange fires than they were using back in May-June 2022. Lastly, we know that Russia is using its AFVs far more sparingly than earlier in the war, and yet they are *still* seeing a huge spike in vehicle losses during their Winter offensive. So it actually does make sense to me that Russia has suffered more casualties in recent months than they had earlier in the conflict. \n\nThe real questions I have are how bad have Ukrainian casualties been, and what is the breakdown of losses for each side in terms of professional vs \"expendable\" men.",

Early in Putin's regime the oligarchs really did hold significant power in Russia, but he broke their backs about a decade ago. Today, there really aren't any oligarchs left, just \"putinarchs\" who derive all their power and influence from the regime itself. Without access to state run-enterprises and profitable companies, these people have nothing, they owe everything to Putin directly. He argues that's why we haven't seen any kind of revolt of the rich and powerful in Russia, and likely won't. Those with any power and influence in Russia owe their positions to Putin personally so their fates are tied to the success of his regime. Conversely, some of the less rich and less powerful people in Russia are getting uncomfortable, but they have little ability to influence events and are therefore largely overlooked. \n\nThat being said, such a system has its downsides. Putin has kept utterly corrupt and incompetent leaders like Shoigu and Gerasimov in place because they are loyal to the regime. If he started cutting loose some of those key figures, other influential people loyal to Putin might get nervous and that could undermine the stability of Putin's regime.",

This fit a broader pattern of English-drawn borders used to incentivize dependents on the 19th century UK and make minorities out of majorities (the Kurds were another victim of such border drawing). While it is overly simplistic to conflate the various Taliban organizations with Pashtun ethnicity, the former can be seen as an reaction of the latter to multiple invasions and interferences by outside powers. </p>\n\n<p>And, TBH, the AFG Taliban and TTP are themselves nebulous aggregations of smaller independent groups. It\u2019s what makes protecting former American allies still in AFG so difficult - because while one coalition within the Taliban may declare amnesty as a condition of peace talks with the US, smaller sub-groups are very much still settling scores. In general I think it\u2019s best not to think of the Taliban or TTP as formal organizations in the western sense, but rather as unreliable non-state actors with aligned interests. Negotiating with either is thus very challenging.</p>\n</div>",

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Based on the post in the last thread about the Ukrainian Air Force current inventory. </p>\n\n<p>I had a quick look at ukrainian air bases on google maps to see what there was sitting about. This is quite non credible btw as obviously the vast majority of these sitting about aren&#39;t air worthy and probably will never fly again. Also some may have been destroyed by strikes etc. But I found the Su-24 count especially interesting. </p>\n\n<p>So in about 15 minutes of looking I found: </p>\n\n<p>Starokostiantyniv - 51 Su-24s  (<a href=\"https://ibb.co/8NT97y2\">https://ibb.co/8NT97y2</a>\n<a href=\"https://ibb.co/gv6YPWL\">https://ibb.co/gv6YPWL</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Myrhorod - 23 Su-27 (<a href=\"https://ibb.co/njnkBRc\">https://ibb.co/njnkBRc</a>\n<a href=\"https://ibb.co/zFLvppv\">https://ibb.co/zFLvppv</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Ozerne - 3 Su-27</p>\n\n<p>Kulkabino - 5 -2u-27</p>\n\n<p>Vasylkiv - 25 Mig-29 (<a href=\"https://ibb.co/Dw60ywq\">https://ibb.co/Dw60ywq</a>\n<a href=\"https://ibb.co/qs9Qb6W\">https://ibb.co/qs9Qb6W</a>\n<a href=\"https://ibb.co/6FYgm0M\">https://ibb.co/6FYgm0M</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Ivano Fankvisk - 34 - Mig-29</p>\n\n<p>Bila Tservka - 31 Su-24 (<a href=\"https://ibb.co/Pc2rx0L\">https://ibb.co/Pc2rx0L</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Mykolaiv - 16 Mig-29 / 5 Su-27 / 5 Su-24 (<a href=\"https://ibb.co/xFS4ZtK\">https://ibb.co/xFS4ZtK</a>\n<a href=\"https://ibb.co/K5SBD5f\">https://ibb.co/K5SBD5f</a>)</p>\n\n<p>This is probably only fraction as well, I didn&#39;t spend a lot of time and only looked through main bases, even at those main bases, Ukraine operates a lot of hardened aircraft shelters inherited from the Soviet Union as well. Overall it just goes to show that Ukraine inherited a LOT of Soviet aircraft. I don&#39;t think we can necessarily extrapolate anything else from it.</p>\n</div>",

The fear was that concentrated units, like we see in WWII, were just prime targets for American atomic strikes (which was a correct conclusion, the Americans were going to nuke any Soviet concentration they could find). The solution was to disperse units across the battlefield to fight in small groupings. The problem was, what happens when infantry meets tanks? In WWII the infantry would dig in, deploy guns, and wait for tanks or TDs to come and clear the way, but on the dispersed battlefield you couldn't expect tanks to come save your bacon. Nor did you want to drag around a ton of infantry support assets which would just make you a bigger, slower nuclear target (though the USSR did keep AT guns through the 1980s). \n\nThe solution was the BMP-1 which was a transport, an infantry support asset, and a tank destroyer all in one. It fired a round very similar to the Soviet recoilless rifle then popular with infantry units, which could kill a Leo from the front and would mess up even an M60 (though IIRC it could not kill an M60 with either a glacis or turret front hit). It answered the question \"what about tanks.\" Mated with the AT-3, the BMP became *even more* dangerous in a tank-on-infantry engagement. But in the 1970s the BMP's gun became increasingly less relevant, it was too small and low velocity to be more than an annoyance and the proliferation of composite armors made it basically impossible for a low velocity gun like that to penetrate. The AT missiles became the more serious AT threat, while the gun became primarily a way to deliver AT against infantry positions. Thats why it goes away with the BMP-2, the autocannon is often thought of as a superior anti-infantry tool when paired with explosive rounds. The BMP-3 I dont really understand, but the Russkies seem to like that tandem cannon-gun arrangement so there must be some asset to it.",

In theory, the 73mm gun (Grom) was supposed to support infantry with an ATGM to deal with tanks at longer ranges. In practice the Grom can't hit anything past a couple hundred meters and the guidance of the ATGMs didn't work very well. The US forces at the time relied on the dismounted infantry equipt with Dragons to provide the firepower. The US came out with the Bradley in 1981 with the 25mm cannon, which is a lot better than the Grom at actually hitting things, and the USSR put a 30mm cannon on the BMP-2 at around the same time. The BMP-3 added a 100mm gun that could also fire ATGMs, so it has a HE capability. The Bradley would have to rely on the TOW missiles to destroy hard points. Obviously it's nice to have the firepower, but the larger gun also adds weight and danger to the infantry if the vehicle gets hit. The weight on the Bradley goes to crew protection; the original Bradley was protected against up to 14.5mm all around and the M2A2 is rated to protect against 30mm from the front. Bradleys hit by friendly fire in Iraq did a great job of protecting their crews and dismounts; troops prefer to ride on top of Russian AFVs for a reason.",

They wanted to give the president and his advisors credit for this and credit for that. They really had done a terrific job, everyone said, of saving Ukraine and acting nimbly in a rapidly evolving, predictably unpredictable conflict.

What does winning in Ukraine even look like? Do we agree with Ukraine that it means restoring its 1991 borders?

Does our concept of victory actually diverge from the Ukrainians\u2019 vision?

And then I don\u2019t know what. I don\u2019t think they will go to the Hill again in the fall to ask for more. If the Ukrainians are wildly successful, that may help.
