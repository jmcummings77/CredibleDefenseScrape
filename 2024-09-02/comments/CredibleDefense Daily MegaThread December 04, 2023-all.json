You can see in the video this part of the line is substantial, with the host mentioning it's their largest investment. He also mentions this step takes around 60 seconds, and that all products go through it.\n\nSo if we treat this as a bottleneck on throughput, assume the rest of the plant can keep up, and assume 66% utilization of the line, we get around 300 shells per 8 hour shift, or let's just be generous and call it 1k shells per day if they're running stops out around the clock. By comparison Ukraine is shelling at 6k per day, so this one line is only about 1/6th their consumption, and one would assume Ukraine would ultimately like to increase consumption.\n\nSo what would it take to duplicate this plant? Money, time, floor space, and most importantly skilled fabricators. As the host mentioned the forge is their biggest investment. These tools are built to order by a relatively small number of specialized companies. With the larger equipment it's often actually installed before the building is finished, as it's too big to install easily after the fact.\n\nThen on the financial side they have to pencil out ROI numbers. What happens if they spend 2 years building new duplicate lines, only for the war in Ukraine to end in 3 years and orders begin to dry up? They have to think about ROI on decades long time frames. A defense contractor isn't going to potentially tank a division of their company no matter how much they personally wish to help Ukraine.\n\nFinding skilled fabricators is certain to be an issue as well. These defense lines by their nature are more old school and less automated, because they don't have the volume to justify the costs of more substantial automation.

But because they already have most of the ingredients and most of the infrastructure (on hand dough and an oven) they might do 200 sandwiches a day and 5 or 6 pizzas a day (it fits the local market). Lets say they are about 60% capacity and to do a pizza they have to run it through the oven twice/run at half speed. Not a big issue but it is tricky. So lets say 300 sandwiches a day or 150 pizzas a day.\n\nYou come in and want 3000 pizzas (a 20x increase over max). \n\nIf its a one off order, its not too big of a deal: order a bunch of extra materials and the price will go up from needing to do double time+ for the 18 hour shifts. But it can get done over a few days, about 5-7 going all out at the risk of burning out your workforce.\n\nYou come in and want 3000 pizzas a day because your building a collage across the street? The one off order isn't going to cut it. You need more workers, more equipment, changes to the back end ordering, more space, etc.\n\nSpace and equipment is going to be a big up front cost. You have cash on hand to cover it, but you need to make that back. Either by jumping the cost per unit or knowing the demand will be there long term. So that takes paperwork to hash out. Its not hard but it takes a little time, say 2 weeks.\n\nOnce that is done you can start getting workers. Again not hard, and pizza is a low skill job, but that still takes say 2 weeks. \n\nThen build time. Lucky there is a building in the unit over that is empty, so 2 weeks to install equipment in.\n\nSub in 'cruise missile' for 'sandwich', '155 shell' for 'pizza', and '2-3 months' for '2 weeks'. NATO is artillery light/missile heavy, so everything is configured for that (running the pizzas twice to account for the sandwich speed in the oven). Your not going to get many willing to splash out 2b for a new facility when they might only make 1b of items, but governments are usually good with contracts, so its just a case of either cost + any rush charge + a flat 2b. Or cost but a 10 year contract. But that needs to be worked out and takes time. Then expansion. And as things that are designed to go boom are a bit spicier than pizzas, training time for that.\n\nAnd your suddenly looking at 6-9 months minimum lead time for extra production for something already produced.",

So lets say 300 sandwiches a day or 150 pizzas a day.</p>\n\n<p>You come in and want 3000 pizzas (a 20x increase over max). </p>\n\n<p>If its a one off order, its not too big of a deal: order a bunch of extra materials and the price will go up from needing to do double time+ for the 18 hour shifts. But it can get done over a few days, about 5-7 going all out at the risk of burning out your workforce.</p>\n\n<p>You come in and want 3000 pizzas a day because your building a collage across the street? The one off order isn&#39;t going to cut it. You need more workers, more equipment, changes to the back end ordering, more space, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Space and equipment is going to be a big up front cost. You have cash on hand to cover it, but you need to make that back. Either by jumping the cost per unit or knowing the demand will be there long term. So that takes paperwork to hash out. Its not hard but it takes a little time, say 2 weeks.</p>\n\n<p>Once that is done you can start getting workers. Again not hard, and pizza is a low skill job, but that still takes say 2 weeks. </p>\n\n<p>Then build time. Lucky there is a building in the unit over that is empty, so 2 weeks to install equipment in.</p>\n\n<p>Sub in &#39;cruise missile&#39; for &#39;sandwich&#39;, &#39;155 shell&#39; for &#39;pizza&#39;, and &#39;2-3 months&#39; for &#39;2 weeks&#39;. NATO is artillery light/missile heavy, so everything is configured for that (running the pizzas twice to account for the sandwich speed in the oven). Your not going to get many willing to splash out 2b for a new facility when they might only make 1b of items, but governments are usually good with contracts, so its just a case of either cost + any rush charge + a flat 2b. Or cost but a 10 year contract. But that needs to be worked out and takes time. Then expansion. And as things that are designed to go boom are a bit spicier than pizzas, training time for that.</p>\n\n<p>And your suddenly looking at 6-9 months minimum lead time for extra production for something already produced.</p>\n</div>",

Now they waited to be sent to prisoner-of-war facilities, far from the front line.\nMoscow\u2019s fall offensive in Ukraine, of which Avdiivka is the primary target, is resulting in a steady flow of Russian POWs. Often, the captured men say they got lost and ended up among Ukrainians by mistake. Voluntary surrender is a crime in Russia. \n\nMany of their comrades were less fortunate. Fields and factory districts around Avdiivka are littered with dead Russian infantry, sent to attack Ukrainian positions in costly frontal assaults. \nRussia is accepting high casualties as the price of advancing. Its troops are pushing gradually into Avdiivka\u2019s outskirts, while also trying to encircle it by taking the surrounding countryside. \n\nThe Ukrainians call the Russian assaults \u201cmeat waves.\u201d The defenders inflict casualties with artillery, drones, mines and tanks, but they are struggling to cope with the Russians\u2019 sheer numbers. Kyiv estimates that Russia currently has over 400,000 troops in Ukraine. Moscow has never disclosed its troop numbers.\n\n\nIf Russia takes Avdiivka, it could open up further local advances in the eastern Donetsk region. It would also be a propaganda win for President Vladimir Putin, allowing him to claim that momentum is back with Moscow after Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive this summer couldn\u2019t achieve a breakthrough. \n\nThe POWs in the makeshift holding facility, mostly in their 30s and 40s, face an indeterminate confinement. Prisoner exchanges between Russia and Ukraine have stalled in recent months.\nYet some of the Russians sitting in the garage also expressed relief.

They described their motivations for joining the Russian army fighting in Ukraine, their brief training and their units\u2019 low morale after being ordered to conduct costly assaults. The Journal verified their identities and has withheld their surnames. \n\nCombat at Avdiivka was \u201can animal nightmare,\u201d said Sergei, a former factory worker from Perm near the Ural Mountains who signed up in October for money. His old job paid 30,000 rubles a month, he said, or about $340. The army offered him 100,000. \n\nTraining consisted mostly of menial chores such as picking up branches, he said. Combat preparation consisted of firing two magazines\u2019 worth of ammunition from an assault rifle, he said, and mostly theoretical first-aid lessons. \nHe didn\u2019t expect to be at the front line. He thought he would only be driving trucks in the rear, he said. \n\nSent straight to Avdiivka, his unit was ordered to attack Ukrainian-held tree lines on the city\u2019s northern flank. But the assault was driven back by Ukrainian armored vehicles. The unit retreated to its starting position, leaving dead men strewn across the muddy fields.\n\nSergei was wounded but was soon sent back to the front line. In late November, he was captured while disoriented, he said. \u201cI felt relieved. I don\u2019t want to see this nightmare anymore.\u201d His family hasn\u2019t seen any of his promised pay yet, he said. The Ukrainians let him and other POWs phone home. \n\nPavel was drafted in late 2022, during Putin\u2019s first big wave of conscription to bolster Russian forces in Ukraine, which were on the retreat at the time. \u201cMy choice was either to come here or face a fine or prison,\u201d said the former machine-tool operator from Siberia.\n\nTactical training consisted of charging across a field, in the style of Soviet-era World War II movies in which troops shout \u201cfor Stalin!,\u201d said Pavel.\n\nHe spent many months in the rear in northeastern Ukraine. He saw little action but came to fear large Ukrainian drones that buzz unseen in the night, which Russians have dubbed \u201cBaba Yaga\u201d\u2014an evil witch in Eastern European folk tales.\n\nThis fall, Pavel\u2019s unit was sent to Avdiivka and told they were now assault troops. \n\nHis company was ordered to cross the fiercely contested train tracks north of the city and take some trenches, he said. Many of their vehicles were knocked out by artillery well before they reached the Ukrainian position. Russian infantry fell dead and wounded in the mud. The unit took and held the trenches, taking more casualties, before being relieved.\n\n\u201cThe captain said we fulfilled our goal. But how can you say that if only 35 out of 100 men came back?\u201d said Pavel. \u201cAnd that was just on one day.\u201d He blamed the losses on commanders\u2019 blunt tactic of frontal assaults and on the men\u2019s lack of training. \u201cTo become real assault troops takes work and a lot of time,\u201d he said. \n\nRussian authorities have disclosed very little information about the heavy casualties in the war, noted Pavel. \u201cNow I saw them with my own eyes.\u201d \n\nOne night his depleted company was sent back to the contested area near the train tracks to stabilize the Russian position. He was ordered to help collect some wounded men. He said he and another man lost their way and ended up at a Ukrainian-held tree line.\n\n\u201cI thought this is the end. We went to ground and shouted \u2018don\u2019t shoot!\u2019\u201d he said. The Ukrainian soldiers told them they were very lucky men: They had just wandered through a minefield.\n\nRussian commanders\u2019 insistence on sending wounded men back to the front is another reason for low morale, said Andrei, who was also taken prisoner north of Avdiivka. \n\nRussian soldiers are dying because they are ordered to attack positions where they have no protection from Ukrainian fire even if they succeed, he said. But commanders are under orders from higher up, he said. \n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t follow an order, you will face either a long time in prison or you\u2019ll be shot,\u201d he said. \n\nAndrei, a former bank worker, said he volunteered for the army because many of his relatives had served. He thought he would be in a reserve unit because he has a heart condition but instead was sent to the front line. \n\nSoon he found himself at Avdiivka, advancing in an armored vehicle with 11 other men when it hit a mine. Half of the men were killed. He was badly concussed. He lay there all night until he found the energy to stagger back to base, he said. After three weeks\u2019 rest, he was back in a trench, where men around him were being killed by shelling. They withdrew.\n\u201cI got lost,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw two soldiers and asked for water. They were Ukrainian.\u201d \n\nThe losses on both sides are \u201cunjustified,\u201d Andrei said, calling it a war between brothers. It is a description that Ukrainians, after years of Russian efforts to control, invade and subjugate them, decidedly reject.",

Now they waited to be sent to prisoner-of-war facilities, far from the front line.\nMoscow\u2019s fall offensive in Ukraine, of which Avdiivka is the primary target, is resulting in a steady flow of Russian POWs. Often, the captured men say they got lost and ended up among Ukrainians by mistake. Voluntary surrender is a crime in Russia. </p>\n\n<p>Many of their comrades were less fortunate. Fields and factory districts around Avdiivka are littered with dead Russian infantry, sent to attack Ukrainian positions in costly frontal assaults. \nRussia is accepting high casualties as the price of advancing. Its troops are pushing gradually into Avdiivka\u2019s outskirts, while also trying to encircle it by taking the surrounding countryside. </p>\n\n<p>The Ukrainians call the Russian assaults \u201cmeat waves.\u201d The defenders inflict casualties with artillery, drones, mines and tanks, but they are struggling to cope with the Russians\u2019 sheer numbers. Kyiv estimates that Russia currently has over 400,000 troops in Ukraine.

            "body": "After reading them again, I can't stress enough how important these two articles are. Without exaggeration, they're the most important news stories that will get published in the next 24 hours. If you have the time at any point today, give them a read in their entirety. It won't be wasted time. That being said, here are a few of the more interesting tidbits from the two articles that I wanted to comment on:\n\n>War-gaming \u201cdoesn\u2019t work,\u201d [a senior Ukrainian military official] said in retrospect, in part because of the new technology that was transforming the battlefield.\n\nThese article attempt to provide both US and UA views of the factors underpinning the counteroffensive failure. While I think both sides have points, overall I come down favoring the US's version of events, and statements like this are a big contributor to that. Ukraine did not follow US recommendations derived from the wargames and then failed, and their conclusion from that is that wargames don't work. This attitude is very concerning to me personally.\n\n>The more immediate alternative would entail tapping the U.S. military\u2019s arsenal of 155mm shells that, unlike the South Korean variant, were packed with cluster munitions. The Pentagon had thousands of them, gathering dust for decades. But Secretary of State Antony Blinken balked.\n\nThe blame for delays in cluster munitions finally gets laid at the feet of a specific person. To be clear, I don't think it was solely Blinken's call to delay cluster munitions. Nothing is ever that simple. But its interesting that in this case, it seems it was the State Department that got cold feet, and for political/moral reasons at that.\n\n>U.S. intelligence officials, skeptical of the Pentagon\u2019s enthusiasm, assessed the likelihood of success at no better than 50-50. The estimate frustrated their Defense Department counterparts, especially those at U.S. European Command, who recalled the spies\u2019 erroneous prediction in the days before the 2022 invasion that Kyiv would fall to the Russians within days.\n\nGood old overcorrection. \"They were wrong about one thing, therefore they will be wrong about the next thing\" is a surefire way to miss a target in the opposite direction as last time.\n\n>In addition, in a tactic used in both World War I and II, Surovikin would deploy blocking units behind the Russian troops to prevent them from retreating, sometimes under pain of death.\n\nBlocking units have been rumored for some time now, but this is the most credible source I know of reporting on their use along the Surovikin Line.\n\n>But that assessment was changing quickly. The goal had been to strike before Moscow was ready, and the U.S. military had been trying since mid-April to get the Ukrainians moving. \u201cWe were given dates. We were given many dates,\u201d a senior U.S. government official said. \u201cWe had April this, May that, you know, June. It just kept getting delayed.\u201d\n\nInteresting to see that the timeline for the counteroffensive slipped behind the scenes in the same way that it did in public. \n\n>Zaluzhny told his troops to pause their assaults before any more of Ukraine\u2019s limited weaponry was obliterated, a senior Ukrainian military official said.\n\nZaluzhny blinked. Interesting to see that this was a decision from the highest echelons of command as opposed to one requested by the lower units. The concerns about force preservation seem like \"too little, too late\".

Without exaggeration, they&#39;re the most important news stories that will get published in the next 24 hours. If you have the time at any point today, give them a read in their entirety. It won&#39;t be wasted time. That being said, here are a few of the more interesting tidbits from the two articles that I wanted to comment on:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>War-gaming \u201cdoesn\u2019t work,\u201d [a senior Ukrainian military official] said in retrospect, in part because of the new technology that was transforming the battlefield.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These article attempt to provide both US and UA views of the factors underpinning the counteroffensive failure. While I think both sides have points, overall I come down favoring the US&#39;s version of events, and statements like this are a big contributor to that. Ukraine did not follow US recommendations derived from the wargames and then failed, and their conclusion from that is that wargames don&#39;t work. This attitude is very concerning to me personally.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The more immediate alternative would entail tapping the U.S. military\u2019s arsenal of 155mm shells that, unlike the South Korean variant, were packed with cluster munitions. The Pentagon had thousands of them, gathering dust for decades. But Secretary of State Antony Blinken balked.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The blame for delays in cluster munitions finally gets laid at the feet of a specific person. To be clear, I don&#39;t think it was solely Blinken&#39;s call to delay cluster munitions. Nothing is ever that simple. But its interesting that in this case, it seems it was the State Department that got cold feet, and for political/moral reasons at that.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>U.S. intelligence officials, skeptical of the Pentagon\u2019s enthusiasm, assessed the likelihood of success at no better than 50-50. The estimate frustrated their Defense Department counterparts, especially those at U.S. European Command, who recalled the spies\u2019 erroneous prediction in the days before the 2022 invasion that Kyiv would fall to the Russians within days.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Good old overcorrection. &quot;They were wrong about one thing, therefore they will be wrong about the next thing&quot; is a surefire way to miss a target in the opposite direction as last time.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In addition, in a tactic used in both World War I and II, Surovikin would deploy blocking units behind the Russian troops to prevent them from retreating, sometimes under pain of death.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Blocking units have been rumored for some time now, but this is the most credible source I know of reporting on their use along the Surovikin Line.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>But that assessment was changing quickly. The goal had been to strike before Moscow was ready, and the U.S. military had been trying since mid-April to get the Ukrainians moving. \u201cWe were given dates. We were given many dates,\u201d a senior U.S. government official said. \u201cWe had April this, May that, you know, June. It just kept getting delayed.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Interesting to see that the timeline for the counteroffensive slipped behind the scenes in the same way that it did in public. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Zaluzhny told his troops to pause their assaults before any more of Ukraine\u2019s limited weaponry was obliterated, a senior Ukrainian military official said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Zaluzhny blinked. Interesting to see that this was a decision from the highest echelons of command as opposed to one requested by the lower units. The concerns about force preservation seem like &quot;too little, too late&quot;. If your first echelon is so valuable it can&#39;t be lost, your whole operation needs to be rethought from the ground up.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>U.S. military officials believed that Ukraine could have made a more significant advance by embracing greater use of ground reconnaissance units and reducing its reliance on imagery from drones, which weren\u2019t able to detect buried mines, tripwires or booby traps.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Drones aren&#39;t perfect.</p>\n</div>",

Recon units and sappers sent into the forward area to evaluate the routes (route recon is literally a job for recon units)\n2. Recon in force over the winter and spring to test the minefields\n3. Recon in force early in the offensive before the actual breeching elements; though they could lose the tactical element of surprise, they didn't have surprise to begin with since this was the most telegraphed offensive in modern military history. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"Here, have barely 30 Leopards, 50 Bradley's, at most 5 weeks of basic training for conscripted soldiers, not enough shells, zero air support, CAS, or almost zero frontline SHORAD, and off you go against massive minefield, drone spotted artillery kill zones, K-52s with ATGMs and whole Russian mobilized army.\n\nHere's a more accurate version: \n\nIn lieu of better offensively capable brigades that were mauled in Bakhmut, the UAF chose an inexperienced brigade that was hyped up by the UAF General Staff and deliberately tasked to be the lead element of their counteroffensive, even chosen to star in the UAF's theatrical Counteroffensive trailer, who were given the absolute best western equipment, enough for a full mech infantry brigade with three battalions of Brads and their accompanying tank battalion of Leopard 2A6, the most up-to-date fielded variant. \n\nThey're the first to be given US Army combined arms training, finishing months before the offensive started. They continued training back in Ukraine. Two company commanders have since come out and said their own chain of command told them the Russians were expected to rout as soon as they were attacked. \n\nThey were given many hundreds of thousands of shells right before the offensive started. \n\nKA-52 had known to be active in the theater of operations already, and the role they performed in the South was literally doctrinal. \n\nThe UAF has SHORAD, its defending their cities and responsible for them claiming +90% kills on incoming strategic raids. \n\nAccording to Michael Kofman, who spoke to a UAF engineering officer, the density and size of the minefields in the South were essentially identical to minefields encountered in the Kherson Bridghead. Note, the operational level commander of the UAF counteroffensive WAS THE SAME COMMANDER OF THE KHERSON OFFENSIVE. \n\nThe Russians having performed a partial mobilization wasn't unknown in June 2023 or at any point in the planning process of their counteroffensive. \n\nDon't strain your arms carrying Ukraine's water.

Note, the operational level commander of the UAF counteroffensive WAS THE SAME COMMANDER OF THE KHERSON OFFENSIVE. </p>\n\n<p>The Russians having performed a partial mobilization wasn&#39;t unknown in June 2023 or at any point in the planning process of their counteroffensive. </p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t strain your arms carrying Ukraine&#39;s water.

        "body": "What a shit show this is\u2026\n\n\n[US officials frustrated by Biden administration\u2019s response to attacks in Red Sea](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/04/biden-response-red-sea-attacks-00130018)\n\nJake Sullivan said the U.S. \u2018cannot assess\u2019 a U.S. warship was targeted.\n\nAn hours-long firefight involving U.S. commercial vessels in the Red Sea this weekend has left some U.S. officials frustrated by what they see as the Biden administration\u2019s deliberate downplaying of a major threat to American forces.\n\nA U.S. Navy warship scrambled to respond to multiple distress calls on Sunday, as Houthi rebels in Yemen launched missiles and drones against three separate commercial vessels. The USS Carney fired back, taking down three unmanned aerial systems.\n\nDefense Department spokespeople and top administration officials, including national security adviser Jake Sullivan, have said the U.S. \u201ccannot assess\u201d that the Carney was the target of the attacks. Similarly, after previous Houthi drone and missile attacks on commercial shipping in past weeks, the Pentagon said officials did not believe the Houthis were aiming for the U.S. warships.\nBut four other officials with knowledge of the discussions said in interviews that U.S. naval forces are clearly under threat in the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf.\n\n\u201cIf our ships see something is coming near them or toward them, they are going to assess it as a threat and shoot it down,\u201d said one DOD official, who like others in this story was granted anonymity to discuss a sensitive topic. \u201cYou\u2019d be hard-pressed to find another time\u201d U.S. ships have been this challenged in the region.\n\nA separate U.S. official argued the administration was downplaying the seriousness of the situation in the Red Sea in order to avoid escalating tensions in a region that\u2019s already on edge over the conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.\n\n\u201cPeople are thinking this is an Israel thing, and because they are heavy-handed in Gaza no one is saying anything,\u201d the official said. \u201cThe world should be condemning this.\u201d\n\nA second U.S. official acknowledged that the U.S. has taken pains to say it does not know whether the Carney was the target because it is \u201ctrying to avoid unnecessary escalation.\u201d But the official also pointed out that the administration has deliberately left some wiggle room and has not said definitively that the warship was not targeted.\n\n\u201cWe are not hesitating to take action against forces or militia groups that could be a threat to our forces,\u201d the official said.\n\nSome DOD officials have said explicitly that the increase in attacks on commercial shipping is an escalation. Adm. Christopher Grady, vice chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, highlighted the attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea as \u201ca big deal.\u201d\n\nGrady said \u201cthis is very much an expansion of perhaps the larger conflict between Israel and Hamas\u201d \u2014 a contrast to recent comments by Pentagon spokespeople that previous Iran-backed attacks are \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d from the conflict in Gaza.\n\n\u201cThis is not just a U.S. problem. This is an international problem,\u201d Grady said at an event in Washington on Monday. \u201cThere\u2019s undoubtedly an Iranian hand in this. So this looks a little bit like horizontal escalation.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. has retaliated against dozens of attacks by Iranian proxies in Iraq and Syria in recent weeks, including striking facilities used by the militants in both countries. On Sunday, U.S. forces in Iraq observed five militants preparing to launch a one-way attack drone and sent an uncrewed aerial system to take them out, according to the Pentagon. Iraqi forces later confirmed the five militants were killed.\n\nOfficials did not rule out the possibility that the administration will respond to the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea.\n\n\u201cIf we make the assessment or feel the need to respond, we will always make that decision at a time or place of our choosing.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>What a shit show this is\u2026</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/04/biden-response-red-sea-attacks-00130018\">US officials frustrated by Biden administration\u2019s response to attacks in Red Sea</a></p>\n\n<p>Jake Sullivan said the U.S. \u2018cannot assess\u2019 a U.S. warship was targeted.</p>\n\n<p>An hours-long firefight involving U.S. commercial vessels in the Red Sea this weekend has left some U.S. officials frustrated by what they see as the Biden administration\u2019s deliberate downplaying of a major threat to American forces.</p>\n\n<p>A U.S. Navy warship scrambled to respond to multiple distress calls on Sunday, as Houthi rebels in Yemen launched missiles and drones against three separate commercial vessels. The USS Carney fired back, taking down three unmanned aerial systems.</p>\n\n<p>Defense Department spokespeople and top administration officials, including national security adviser Jake Sullivan, have said the U.S. \u201ccannot assess\u201d that the Carney was the target of the attacks. Similarly, after previous Houthi drone and missile attacks on commercial shipping in past weeks, the Pentagon said officials did not believe the Houthis were aiming for the U.S. warships.\nBut four other officials with knowledge of the discussions said in interviews that U.S. naval forces are clearly under threat in the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf our ships see something is coming near them or toward them, they are going to assess it as a threat and shoot it down,\u201d said one DOD official, who like others in this story was granted anonymity to discuss a sensitive topic. \u201cYou\u2019d be hard-pressed to find another time\u201d U.S. ships have been this challenged in the region.</p>\n\n<p>A separate U.S. official argued the administration was downplaying the seriousness of the situation in the Red Sea in order to avoid escalating tensions in a region that\u2019s already on edge over the conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cPeople are thinking this is an Israel thing, and because they are heavy-handed in Gaza no one is saying anything,\u201d the official said. \u201cThe world should be condemning this.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>A second U.S. official acknowledged that the U.S. has taken pains to say it does not know whether the Carney was the target because it is \u201ctrying to avoid unnecessary escalation.\u201d But the official also pointed out that the administration has deliberately left some wiggle room and has not said definitively that the warship was not targeted.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe are not hesitating to take action against forces or militia groups that could be a threat to our forces,\u201d the official said.</p>\n\n<p>Some DOD officials have said explicitly that the increase in attacks on commercial shipping is an escalation. Adm. Christopher Grady, vice chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, highlighted the attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea as \u201ca big deal.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Grady said \u201cthis is very much an expansion of perhaps the larger conflict between Israel and Hamas\u201d \u2014 a contrast to recent comments by Pentagon spokespeople that previous Iran-backed attacks are \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d from the conflict in Gaza.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis is not just a U.S. problem. This is an international problem,\u201d Grady said at an event in Washington on Monday. \u201cThere\u2019s undoubtedly an Iranian hand in this. So this looks a little bit like horizontal escalation.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The U.S. has retaliated against dozens of attacks by Iranian proxies in Iraq and Syria in recent weeks, including striking facilities used by the militants in both countries. On Sunday, U.S. forces in Iraq observed five militants preparing to launch a one-way attack drone and sent an uncrewed aerial system to take them out, according to the Pentagon. Iraqi forces later confirmed the five militants were killed.</p>\n\n<p>Officials did not rule out the possibility that the administration will respond to the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf we make the assessment or feel the need to respond, we will always make that decision at a time or place of our choosing.

You would have to go back to the first few months of OIF to maybe see large army formations advancing against other conventional combined arms units and not taking a tactical pause every step of the way to blow up what's in front of them. As it was the accordion effect was real, which caused pauses anyway. This is ignoring that the Iraqis were not a peer to the US Army.\n\nSo much to unpack here. \n\nFirst, the US Army and Marines, being competent military forces with good training, comms and coordination, do rely on responsive on-call fire support while doing combined arms operations. In the form of heavy weapons, IFV, tanks, mortars, arty, GMLRS, rotary wing and fixed wing air support. We don't just use air strikes for everything, support is tiered, task organized, often not available (especially air support), and definitely not doctrinally guaranteed even a tiny bit. \n\nOIF (and I'm a veteran of that war) didn't even use much fixed wing air support. Most of what we used was rotary wing, Apaches, who were awesome at CAS because there was a minimal ADA threat, they had outstanding loiter time, they flew low and slow, their air crews were exceptionally good at working with ground forces (not something many fixed wing pilots can say), their optics were fantastic for spotting targets, and they had firepower that worked very well for the threat (most kills were actually made with the 30mm gun). \n\nWhen it came to fixed wing airstrikes, most of those were called in, in lieu of artillery, because bombs were all JDAMs, so guided, while all artillery wasn't. A standard US Army or Marine commander had access to nothing organic larger than a tank gun that could hit and destroy a large target with one shot. If we used arty (and we did, a lot), we acknowledged it was an area weapon which meant not hitting a target building, it meant hitting entire blocks. With a JDAM, we could hit individual buildings, to limit collateral damage and ensure the actual target we wanted dead would be dead. \n\nIn Afghanistan, it was even crazier. To start things out, until 2006 when Rumsfeld got fired, arty was barely allowed to be used as a political decision. Rumsfeld specifically didn't want the US/ISAF to catch the same bad rap as the Russians, who used artillery indiscriminately in their war. So we used precision air strikes instead. Fixed wing was often better than rotary wing because of response time and distances; a platoon in a Troops In Contact situation on the border with Pakistan needing responsive fire support can't wait for three hours for Apaches vectored from central Afghanistan to show up; fixed wing going full afterburner can arrive in 15 minutes instead. \n\nAnd even when Rumsfeld got fired and arty was allowed again, there often wasn't enough. Take Regional Command East, which was US Army controlled for most of the war. That was roughly the size of Pennsylvania, had 120 Combat Outposts (COP) in it, which could be manned by a whopping 150 platoon sized maneuver elements. Which meant most COPs were only platoon sized, which meant maybe they had one 120mm mortar to support them. Company sized COPs sometimes had artillery pieces on them to support neighboring areas, and when they did almost none had more than a pair of M777 meant to support up to a dozen smaller COPs in firing range. \n\nAdd in significant ROEs that went into effect in 2010, and they weren't even allowed to use arty for most TIC situation because they were area weapons. The famous Battle of Ganjgal in 2009, an Afghan unit was getting annihilated in an ambush and the US forces with them wouldn't even allow HE rounds from the supporting arty unit to fire to help them because the village that the Taliban were inside might also contain civilians. \n\nMeanwhile, and I can't stress this enough, the US Army and Marines had almost entirely dropped COIN doctrine by the mid 2010s and switched to Near Peer focus. \n\nBack in September, just to try to silence this crap talking point, that the US military doesn't know what it's doing, [I posted this](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/16bie0u/comment/jzf0n4d/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), an account of a US Army infantry squad leader who didn't even enter the military until 2014, who has been doing almost nothing since besides prepping to fight Russia. \n\nContinued in Part II",

And that is: the election hasn't even started yet. There has not been even one primary vote cast, were 11 months away from the key moment. If this were Sept. 2024, it would be massively important. But IMO its unlikely the war will last another 11 mo. I would be surprised if it lasted 6 more weeks, and once it falls out of the headlines its going to lose any impact on voters who are going to be animated by the real issues of the presidential campaign. For example, consider how badly Afghanistan hurt Biden in the moment. But by the time people went to the polls, it wasn't a first order issue. Likewise people will be mad now, Biden's numbers will slip a bit, but when they see who the winner of the Republican primary will be and what they support those disillusioned voters are more likely to come back on side than sit 2024 out.

Preventing Russia from getting reelected to the board of the group is cast as part of that plan, said the people on condition of anonymity to discuss the memo\u2019s content.\n\n>Moscow sought to urge those it lobbied to challenge what it called the unrestrained politicization of the OPCW and to protect the body from \u201cfinal destruction.\u201d \n\n>Despite those efforts, **Russia received the fewest votes of any nominated country,** and lost out to Ukraine, Poland and Lithuania for board membership.\n\n>Moscow was deeply frustrated by the outcome and is investigating what went wrong, one of the people said. \n\n>The Russian Foreign Ministry didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n>The result was welcomed by Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. \u201cOPCW is a very reputable international body and terrorists have no place in it,\u201d he posted on the platform X.\n\n> The vote underscores Moscow\u2019s waning influence in international organizations as a result of its February 2022 invasion of Ukraine and is indicative of how few friends it has in some of these bodies, despite intense lobbying efforts. Russia has been suspended from the Council of Europe, the UN Human Rights Council and the global anti-money laundering group Financial Action Task Force. On Friday, the country failed to win reelection to the governing council of the International Maritime Organization.\n\n>Moscow\u2019s relationship with the OPCW had been clouded before Vladimir Putin\u2019s war against Ukraine. In 2018, a group of Russian spies were caught trying to hack the international body to gain access to an investigation into a nerve-agent attack targeting Sergei Skripal, a former Russian intelligence officer living in the UK.\n\n>Among the talking points pushed by the Russian Foreign Ministry ahead of the OPCW vote was a claim that the \u201cSkripal case\u201d was mounted by the British secret service. Another argued the \u201calleged poisoning\u201d of opposition politician Alexey Navalny in 2020 was similarly provoked by Germany.\n\n>There is ample evidence that Russian intelligence was behind both attacks.\n\n> Offering a window into how the Kremlin uses its diplomatic network to spread disinformation internationally, the memo repeats unsubstantiated claims that the US has provided Ukraine with \u201ctoxic chemicals,\u201d and that Kyiv, foreign mercenaries and Ukrainian militants planned to use those alleged deliveries to create \u201cprovocations.\u201d",

In 2018, a group of Russian spies were caught trying to hack the international body to gain access to an investigation into a nerve-agent attack targeting Sergei Skripal, a former Russian intelligence officer living in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>Among the talking points pushed by the Russian Foreign Ministry ahead of the OPCW vote was a claim that the \u201cSkripal case\u201d was mounted by the British secret service. Another argued the \u201calleged poisoning\u201d of opposition politician Alexey Navalny in 2020 was similarly provoked by Germany.</p>\n\n<p>There is ample evidence that Russian intelligence was behind both attacks.</p>\n\n<p>Offering a window into how the Kremlin uses its diplomatic network to spread disinformation internationally, the memo repeats unsubstantiated claims that the US has provided Ukraine with \u201ctoxic chemicals,\u201d and that Kyiv, foreign mercenaries and Ukrainian militants planned to use those alleged deliveries to create \u201cprovocations.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

And once israel decided to keep the Sinai, it was only a matter of time. They ended up giving it back eventually anyway, so there was no point in trying to keep it in the first place besides getting too comfortable.</p>\n</div>",

The ROC\u2019s Moscow Patriarchate Publishing House is selling a children\u2019s novel To Live: To Serve the Motherland that prepares children to serve in the Russian military using nationalist and religious ideals.[78] The book includes chapters about: \u201cHoly Fathers on War, Peace, and the Russian Military;\u201d \u201cThere is No Life in War without Digging;\u201d \u201cCombat Training: Strength, Bravery, and Dexterity,\u201d and \u201cRussian Land is All under God.\u201d[79]\n\n- **Russian Technological Adaptations (Russian objective: Introduce technological innovations to optimize systems for use in Ukraine)**\n\n> Russian MLRS manufacturer NPO Splav, a subsidiary of Russian state-owned defense conglomerate Rostec, has patented a new MLRS projectile that reportedly has an extended range and is supersonic.

Kherson Oblast occupation head Vladimir Saldo participated in a conference for Kherson Oblast\u2019s United Russia branch in occupied Henichesk on December 2 and claimed that there are 6,500 United Russia members and supporters in occupied Kherson Oblast, including 200 oblast-level and local-level officials.[82] The Ukrainian Resistance Center reported on November 3 that Russian occupation officials are attempting to use United Russia activities in occupied Ukraine to generate support among locals and legitimize the Russian occupation.[83]\n\n> The Ukrainian Resistance Center reported on December 3 that Russian occupation authorities forcibly deported 100 Ukrainians from occupied Kherson Oblast to Russia under evacuation schemes in November 2023.[84] Russian occupation officials routinely use the guise of evacuations, medical treatment, vacation opportunities, and educational programs to deport residents from occupied Ukraine to Russia.[85]\n\n- **Russian Information Operations and Narratives**\n\n> Pro-Kremlin actors are amplifying reports of Ukrainian social and governmental division, specifically those involving Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, to discredit Ukrainian leadership and weaken Western support for Ukraine. The Ukrainian Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) and Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) warned about renewed Russian efforts to spread propaganda to reduce support for Ukraine and split Ukrainian society from within by fostering mistrust between government officials and between civilians and the government.[86] This effort is congruent with the erroneous pre-war Kremlin understanding of the Ukrainian government, namely that Ukrainians did not support their government and would welcome Russia\u2019s attempt at regime change, that likely influenced Russian decision-making to conduct the 2022 full-scale invasion.[87] This new wave of Russian information operations is therefore part of an existing narrative line that Russian actors are promoting towards a new aim. The GUR and SBU reported that Russian sources specifically intend to sow mistrust in Ukrainian state bodies that organize prisoner of war exchanges (POWs) and hope to garner Ukrainian support for a negotiated settlement with Russia to freeze the frontlines. Domestic tensions are not unusual while sustaining a war effort, particularly in a free country with a robust civil society facing a protracted and difficult conflict like the one in Ukraine.\n\n- **Significant activity in Belarus (Russian efforts to increase its military presence in Belarus and further integrate Belarus into Russian-favorable frameworks and Wagner Group activity in Belarus)**\n\n> Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko arrived in Beijing, China on December 3 and will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping on December 3 and 4 to discuss trade, economic investment, and international cooperation.[88]",

            "body": "Non frontline combat news (first 2 are from the introduction, as it's a bit thin today):\n\n- **Russia continues to reckon with the economic ramifications of labor shortages partially resulting from the war in Ukraine.** \n\n> Russian state media outlets reported on December 4 that Russian consulting company Yakov and Partners has recorded increased labor shortages in domestic production that will likely grow to a deficit of two to four million workers by 2030, 90 percent of whom are likely to be semi-skilled workers in critical industries.[1] Yakov and Partners noted that this supply shortage will place upward pressure on workers\u2019 wages that will outpace GDP growth and make Russian companies even less attractive to foreign investment.[2] Russian outlet RBK cited Russian economic experts who stated that this problem can only be resolved through improved interactions between Russian businesses and the state, including through dedicated programs to repatriate Russians who fled the country due to the war and programs to attract \"highly-qualified\" migrants from other countries.[3] ISW previously assessed that Russia continues to face shortages in both skilled and unskilled labor, a problem that is further compounded by the Kremlin's inconsistent and often inflammatory messaging about Russians who fled Russia because of the war and against migrant workers within Russia.[4] The Russian economy will likely continue to grapple with the Kremlin's competing desires to bolster Russia's force generation and industrial capacity while simultaneously disenfranchising key labor groups, which is likely to lead to continued concerns over Russian economic output and potential resulting social grievances.\n\n- **Kremlin-backed United Russia State Duma deputies and Federation Council senators proposed a bill to introduce criminal punishments for leaking personal data, likely as part of ongoing efforts to control the Russian information space ahead of the March 2024 Russian presidential elections.** \n\n> The United Russia legislators proposed a bill that would allow Russian authorities to sentence individuals to up to four years in prison for storing, transferring, or collecting personal data \u201cobtained illegally,\u201d and up to five years if the information contains unspecified \u201cspecial categories of data\u201d or personal biometric data.[18] The bill also stipulates that Russian authorities could punish someone with up to six years in prison for \u201dillegal use of personal data for selfish interest\u201d and could punish someone with up to eight years in prison and a two million ruble (about $21,850) fine for transferring \u201dillegally acquired\u201d personal data abroad.[19] Russian opposition outlet Agentstvo Novosti reported that the bill\u2019s definition of personal data includes an individual\u2019s first name, surname, patronymic, address, phone number, address, and email.[20] Agentstvo Novosti noted that the bill\u2019s implementation would criminalize database analysis \u2013 one of the few tools left to independent Russian investigative journalists.[21] The Russian government has been prosecuting Russian internet service companies Yandex and Google under laws about illegal storing of personal data of Russian users likely to gain further control over internet companies operating in Russia to better track Russians\u2019 personal information and online data ahead of the Russian 2024 presidential election.[22] The bill is also likely part of ongoing Russian government efforts to restrict Russian citizens\u2019 access to information on the internet and the activities of opposition figures and media outlets.[23]\n\n- **Russian Mobilization and Force Generation Efforts (Russian objective: Expand combat power without conducting general mobilization)**\n\n> Select Russian Duma deputies appear to be at odds over the issue of extending Russian conscript service. Russian State Duma Defense Committee Chairman Andrei Kartapolov dismissed a Duma deputy\u2019s call for increased conscript service periods. Duma Deputy and former Deputy Commander of the Southern Military District (SMD) Lieutenant General Andrei Gurulev proposed on December 3 that the Russian military require conscripts to serve for two years instead of one.[66] Gurulev claimed that a two-year requirement would increase the quantity of conscripts without having to increase the number of conscripts called up.[67] Gurulev also claimed that two-year service terms would increase the quality of conscript training.[68] Gurulev claimed that this increased service term would also help build up the Russian border protection troops, which Gurlev claimed have proven recently to be ineffective.[69] Duma Deputy Viktor Sobolev supported Gurulev\u2019s call as a way for conscripts to be \u201ctruly combat-ready.\u201d[70] Kartapolov rejected Gurulev\u2019s call on December 4 and claimed that conscripts are \u201ccapable of mastering a military specialty in one year\u201d so a second year would be a waste of time, government resources, and labor.[71]\n\n> The Russian MoD proposed unspecified changes to military medical examination requirements. The Russian MoD submitted a draft proposal on December 3 to change the \u201corganization\u201d of medical examinations of military conscripts, contract personnel, mobilized reserves, and those called up for military training for those who have diseases that do not have a \u201csignificant impact\u201d on their ability to perform military duties.[72] The MoD did not offer specifics about what these changes would entail, but this is likely part of the longstanding Russian effort to expand categories of personnel liable for military service.\n\n- **Russian Technological Adaptations (Russian objective: Introduce technological innovations to optimize systems for use in Ukraine)**\n\n> Russian state-owned defense conglomerate Rostec stated on November 29 that its electronics subsidiary Roselektronika created a new \u201cfriend or foe\u201d drone recognition system that can identify \u201cfriendly\u201d drones from an altitude of up to five kilometers and from a distance up to 100 kilometers.[73] Rostec stated that the identification system weighs no more than 150 grams and can be integrated into a wide range of drones.\n\n> Rostec subsidiary United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) has reportedly recently delivered various modernized aircraft to the Russian military.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Non frontline combat news (first 2 are from the introduction, as it&#39;s a bit thin today):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Russia continues to reckon with the economic ramifications of labor shortages partially resulting from the war in Ukraine.</strong> </li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Russian state media outlets reported on December 4 that Russian consulting company Yakov and Partners has recorded increased labor shortages in domestic production that will likely grow to a deficit of two to four million workers by 2030, 90 percent of whom are likely to be semi-skilled workers in critical industries.[1] Yakov and Partners noted that this supply shortage will place upward pressure on workers\u2019 wages that will outpace GDP growth and make Russian companies even less attractive to foreign investment.[2] Russian outlet RBK cited Russian economic experts who stated that this problem can only be resolved through improved interactions between Russian businesses and the state, including through dedicated programs to repatriate Russians who fled the country due to the war and programs to attract &quot;highly-qualified&quot; migrants from other countries.[3] ISW previously assessed that Russia continues to face shortages in both skilled and unskilled labor, a problem that is further compounded by the Kremlin&#39;s inconsistent and often inflammatory messaging about Russians who fled Russia because of the war and against migrant workers within Russia.[4] The Russian economy will likely continue to grapple with the Kremlin&#39;s competing desires to bolster Russia&#39;s force generation and industrial capacity while simultaneously disenfranchising key labor groups, which is likely to lead to continued concerns over Russian economic output and potential resulting social grievances.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Kremlin-backed United Russia State Duma deputies and Federation Council senators proposed a bill to introduce criminal punishments for leaking personal data, likely as part of ongoing efforts to control the Russian information space ahead of the March 2024 Russian presidential elections.</strong> </li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The United Russia legislators proposed a bill that would allow Russian authorities to sentence individuals to up to four years in prison for storing, transferring, or collecting personal data \u201cobtained illegally,\u201d and up to five years if the information contains unspecified \u201cspecial categories of data\u201d or personal biometric data.[18] The bill also stipulates that Russian authorities could punish someone with up to six years in prison for \u201dillegal use of personal data for selfish interest\u201d and could punish someone with up to eight years in prison and a two million ruble (about $21,850) fine for transferring \u201dillegally acquired\u201d personal data abroad.[19] Russian opposition outlet Agentstvo Novosti reported that the bill\u2019s definition of personal data includes an individual\u2019s first name, surname, patronymic, address, phone number, address, and email.[20] Agentstvo Novosti noted that the bill\u2019s implementation would criminalize database analysis \u2013 one of the few tools left to independent Russian investigative journalists.[21] The Russian government has been prosecuting Russian internet service companies Yandex and Google under laws about illegal storing of personal data of Russian users likely to gain further control over internet companies operating in Russia to better track Russians\u2019 personal information and online data ahead of the Russian 2024 presidential election.[22] The bill is also likely part of ongoing Russian government efforts to restrict Russian citizens\u2019 access to information on the internet and the activities of opposition figures and media outlets.[23]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Russian Mobilization and Force Generation Efforts (Russian objective: Expand combat power without conducting general mobilization)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Select Russian Duma deputies appear to be at odds over the issue of extending Russian conscript service. Russian State Duma Defense Committee Chairman Andrei Kartapolov dismissed a Duma deputy\u2019s call for increased conscript service periods. Duma Deputy and former Deputy Commander of the Southern Military District (SMD) Lieutenant General Andrei Gurulev proposed on December 3 that the Russian military require conscripts to serve for two years instead of one.[66] Gurulev claimed that a two-year requirement would increase the quantity of conscripts without having to increase the number of conscripts called up.[67] Gurulev also claimed that two-year service terms would increase the quality of conscript training.[68] Gurulev claimed that this increased service term would also help build up the Russian border protection troops, which Gurlev claimed have proven recently to be ineffective.[69] Duma Deputy Viktor Sobolev supported Gurulev\u2019s call as a way for conscripts to be \u201ctruly combat-ready.\u201d[70] Kartapolov rejected Gurulev\u2019s call on December 4 and claimed that conscripts are \u201ccapable of mastering a military specialty in one year\u201d so a second year would be a waste of time, government resources, and labor.[71]</p>\n\n<p>The Russian MoD proposed unspecified changes to military medical examination requirements. The Russian MoD submitted a draft proposal on December 3 to change the \u201corganization\u201d of medical examinations of military conscripts, contract personnel, mobilized reserves, and those called up for military training for those who have diseases that do not have a \u201csignificant impact\u201d on their ability to perform military duties.[72] The MoD did not offer specifics about what these changes would entail, but this is likely part of the longstanding Russian effort to expand categories of personnel liable for military service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Russian Technological Adaptations (Russian objective: Introduce technological innovations to optimize systems for use in Ukraine)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Russian state-owned defense conglomerate Rostec stated on November 29 that its electronics subsidiary Roselektronika created a new \u201cfriend or foe\u201d drone recognition system that can identify \u201cfriendly\u201d drones from an altitude of up to five kilometers and from a distance up to 100 kilometers.[73] Rostec stated that the identification system weighs no more than 150 grams and can be integrated into a wide range of drones.</p>\n\n<p>Rostec subsidiary United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) has reportedly recently delivered various modernized aircraft to the Russian military. Rostec stated on December 2 that the UAC Irkutsk Aviation Plant transferred new Su-30SM2 fighter aircraft and Yak-130 combat training aircraft to the Russian MoD.[74] Rostec stated that the Su-30SM2s have improved avionics, increased detection and identification ranges of air targets, and new high-precision weapons.[75] Russian state newswire TASS reported on December 4 that the UAC Nizhny Novgorod Sokol Aviation Plant also transferred modernized MiG-31 interceptor aircraft to the Russian MoD as part of the completion of the state defense order for 2023.[76]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Activities in Russian-occupied areas (Russian objective: Consolidate administrative control of annexed areas; forcibly integrate Ukrainian citizens into Russian sociocultural, economic, military, and governance systems)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Russian Presidential Administration Head for Domestic Policy Andrei Yarin reportedly visited occupied Ukraine as part of ongoing efforts to legitimize Russian authority over occupied Ukraine ahead of the March 2024 Russian presidential election.

UPMKs are also ever improving.</p>\n\n<p>Now lets assume that F-16s will force the Russians to change their current FAB bomb rates, it will take what approximately 6 more ish months before Ukriane has enough F-16s available? So Russia has free reign to keep on bombing the front line until then. </p>\n\n<p>The current rate is 1000 Fabs a month, and is increasing. even if we take in conservative measures of accuracy that the bombs have 200-300 metre CEP and assume that the rate remains 1000 fabs a month.

However, demonstrating the importance of this operation, Castro exercised a high degree of control over operations directly, spending hours at the Cuban general staff headquarters in Havana, receiving a stream of endless reports, situation updates, and force laydowns from a swarm of aides he sent to Angola to perform this function. Ultimately, it was Castro himself who planned the defense of Cuito Cuanavale and ordered many of the key operational moves of FAPLA and Cuban forces during the battle.63 Indeed, Castro\u2019s direct exercise of command infuriated Ochoa, leading Castro to increasingly sideline him in favor of General Leopoldo Cintra Fri\u0301as (known as \u201cPolo\u201d).64\n**Although he may have been 6,000 miles away, Castro\u2019s generalship at Cuito Cuanavale proved critical.** He ordered that all of the FAPLA brigades pull back to a narrow, triangular bridgehead on the east side of the Cuito River, literally where the bridge crosses into Cuito Cuanavale on the west bank. The position was protected by tributary rivers and heavy bush to both the north and south. Castro had Cuban engineers build extensive trenches and mine \\fields in depth around the perimeter of what was called the Tumpo bridgehead. He deployed five FAPLA brigades in a tight, two-tiered defense within the bridgehead, each brigade paired with a battalion or company of Cuban regulars to stiffen their spines. He dug-in another FAPLA brigade on the west bank to hold the Cuito bridge along with a Cuban armored brigade as an operational reserve for the whole force, and placed four battalions of Cuban artillery and MRLs on high ground on the west bank where they could range the entire battlefield and even use direct fire across the river, if the South Africans got that close.\n\n> Between February 14 and March 23, 1988, the SADF mounted at least four deliberate attacks against the Tumpo bridgehead.66 Each was a ferocious struggle, the SADF mustering a mechanized force of 2,000\u20133,000 men, with roughly 30 tanks, and several dozen Ratels and other armored vehicles backed by a dozen or more artillery pieces including the outstanding G-5s and G- 6s...In some of the early battles, the South Africans made progress against the outer line of Cuban-backed FAPLA positions, **prompting Castro to decide in early February**\u2014 against Ochoa\u2019s advice and prompting his replacement by Polo\u2014**to pull all of his units back to the west bank** except the FAPLA 25th Brigade and a task force organized around the Cuban 3rd Tank Battalion. He ordered Cuban and FAPLA sappers to build additional bunkers, trenches, antitank obstacles, and minefields, and concentrated all of the Cuban and Angolan artillery directly behind these positions, along with additional Cuban tanks in hull-down positions along the west bank of the river.\n\n> **Castro\u2019s moves ultimately won the battle.** In each subsequent attack, the SADF would spend hours trying to punch through a forward defensive line, all the while under heavy fire, only to find the forward trenches abandoned\u2014a tactic the Germans had first pioneered.

            "body": "Re: the Abrams numbers, very important to keep them in context here. The US Army is now the only operator of the tank (whereas before the USMC had a few hundred). BUT! they have earmarked a large number of tanks for active units. That is, these tanks are already committed either in Asia/Korea, or to forward deployment in Europe, or are in the US but with units that would move to an active theater within M+30ish of mobilization. Beyond that you have combat brigades in the ARNG, despite Regular Army protests dating back to the 90s. These units are, on paper and institutionally, treated as equivalents to active divisions. The difference is that, on paper, they need 90 days for refresher training, and so constitute in large part our M+90 reserve. The ARNG sells itself based on the idea that these units are fundamentally equivalent to active units, are capable of forming the nation's strategic reserve, and come to the front with the same capabilities as an active division. And that speaks for most of the Abrams in active US service. It is also worth recognizing here that for the US, and in particular the US Army, these Abrams are not open for donations or sale. They are the mechanized force. If you give 100 tanks out of current stock, at best youre weakening the core reserve in a M+90 situation. At worst its coming from the already likely inadequate forces guarding the rest of the Russian border, including the single battalion tripwire force in Lithuania. Were the US to commit ground forces literally anywhere, and assuming they planned to have a mech component which is now *the* mission for the Army in the face of more independant SOF and a lighter more deployable USMC, they need those tanks. The last pool, the A1s & A2s in storage, are likely to be in abysmal condition, stripped for parts, and requiring extensive service to get combat ready. These may be M+12mo or more, and would represent a significant investment in time and dollars. To the point that one wonders why theyre out there, a ton of optimistic thinking there at this point, but another line of discussion all together. And we can reasonably surmise their bad condition based on reporting that suggests how bad off the US Army storage system has been. Like half of all stored transmissions require rebuild, type bad. \n\nAnd so you can inject classic American politics into the problem. If the Army gives up tanks now, will it be likely to get newer better ones in a year or two? Can the Lima plant keep up with the triple pressures of large orders out of Eastern Europe, plus the M1E3 program which will (hopefully) ramp up in the next five years, plus now this new construction/refurb program? To replace Army donations OR get old tanks back up to snuff. Will Congress fund that, or will they talk in a couple years about shuttering Lima *again*. Will they support the Army, or will funds be siphoned off to the Navy at the expense of other key areas? If youre the Army, this kind of conflict proves their relevance in a future conflict. Who else would keep Taiwan's/Korea's/Vietnam's land forces afloat? Who could have predicted the Ukraine war, or the immense need for land systems it generated? Thus you need a strong Army. And within big Army, the ARNG is probably the best pool to draw reserve stocks from *except* that 1) losing equipment attacks their core mission and is a net political win for the Regular Army who has long tried to kill ARNG combat units, 2) the ARNG is extremely politically well connected thanks to having three major lobbying arms (the national ARNG association, each state ARNG, and Governors who LOVE having a little army to play with), and 3) the ARNG is corrupt and not a good steward of what they have, an attempt to dig into their arsenals may well reveal that the M+90 deployment promise is totally bullshit and that Regular Army was right they cannot be trusted to accomplish their core mission.\n\nWhich means as an institution the Army plays a double game where they love to see Ukraine get everything the Army doesn't need, but will SCREAM if they lose their core capabilities. And they have a point, if they are expected to provide conventional land deterrence along some of the frontier regions, they likely will need every tank APC and rifle they have. Were Congress/White House able to provide some replacement guarantee the politics might be different, but that has not happened. Likely because the Army is right in concluding that post-war if China continues to be the big threat theyre in for massive funding cuts anyway, and it could be decades before they convince Congress to design, develop and acquire in mass some hypothetical M2 tank. \n\nBut also all this talk of the M1 is frustrating because what about Europe? There are thousands of Leo2s out there, Germany has hundreds, do they really need all of them?",

And within big Army, the ARNG is probably the best pool to draw reserve stocks from <em>except</em> that 1) losing equipment attacks their core mission and is a net political win for the Regular Army who has long tried to kill ARNG combat units, 2) the ARNG is extremely politically well connected thanks to having three major lobbying arms (the national ARNG association, each state ARNG, and Governors who LOVE having a little army to play with), and 3) the ARNG is corrupt and not a good steward of what they have, an attempt to dig into their arsenals may well reveal that the M+90 deployment promise is totally bullshit and that Regular Army was right they cannot be trusted to accomplish their core mission.</p>\n\n<p>Which means as an institution the Army plays a double game where they love to see Ukraine get everything the Army doesn&#39;t need, but will SCREAM if they lose their core capabilities. And they have a point, if they are expected to provide conventional land deterrence along some of the frontier regions, they likely will need every tank APC and rifle they have. Were Congress/White House able to provide some replacement guarantee the politics might be different, but that has not happened. Likely because the Army is right in concluding that post-war if China continues to be the big threat theyre in for massive funding cuts anyway, and it could be decades before they convince Congress to design, develop and acquire in mass some hypothetical M2 tank. </p>\n\n<p>But also all this talk of the M1 is frustrating because what about Europe? There are thousands of Leo2s out there, Germany has hundreds, do they really need all of them?</p>\n</div>",

I dug through some links to see the supporting evidence for these claims and there's not much there. The section you highlighted about Fiona Hill brings you to another Quincy Institute article which only then links you to the original claim from Fiona Hill and Angela Stent in a Foreign Policy article. What you quoted, namely that \"the two sides had reached a tentative peace deal\" is not exactly what the original article says \"in April 2022, Russian and Ukrainian negotiators appeared to have tentatively agreed on the outlines of a negotiated interim settlement.\" An interim settlement is more akin to a ceasefire than it is a \"peace deal.\" Then your article adds the pure speculation that it was due, at least in part, to pressure from the West that the deal fell apart. The original article from Hill/Stent offers no explanation for why it fell apart. \n\nIronically, the \"smoking gun\" evidence from the Ukrainian Parliamentarian David Arakhamia actually provided perfectly plausible rationales for why the original agreement fell apart without Western pressure:\n\n>There were several reasons the negotiations ultimately collapsed, he said, including the need to change the Ukrainian constitution (which had been amended in February 2019 to enshrine the country\u2019s NATO aspirations), and the fact that Johnson had come to Kyiv to inform Ukrainian officials the West wouldn\u2019t sign any agreement with Moscow, instead urging: \u201clet\u2019s just fight.\u201d \n\n>Arakhamia also said that Kyiv\u2019s lack of trust in the Russian side to fulfill its end of the bargain meant that the peace deal \u201ccould only be done if there were security guarantees\u201d \u2014 suggesting, obliquely, that negotiations could have borne fruit had they received the backing and involvement of NATO states. Western governments\u2019 provision of security guarantees for Ukraine have\u00a0long been part\u00a0of the discussion for how to ensure the sustainability of a post-war peace deal, and in fact, Arakhmia himself\u00a0disclosed\u00a0in the same interview that \u201cthe Western allies advised us not to agree to ephemeral security guarantees.\u201d\n\nIn other words, another explanation for why there wasn't an agreement in April 2022 was because there was zero trust in Russia keeping its word. There was also likely little to no appetite from the West to extend security guarantees to defend Ukraine from a potential future attack from Russia. \n\nSo instead of the author's seeming suggestion that the West has prolonged the war in order to punish Russia, the equally plausible (I'd argue more plausible) explanation is that Ukraine and the West expected Russia to renege on this interim agreement after getting some breathing room and restarting the conflict from a position of greater relative strength. Again, there was also likely zero willingness to extend security guarantees for Ukraine from Western countries, especially since they fully expected Russia to test those guarantees in the future. \n\nSeems odd that this author, who's a supposed realist, doesn't seem to think that Russia's designs on Ukraine extended beyond merely forcing them to openly declare neutrality (was a full-scale invasion including an attempt to take Kyiv needed for this goal?), and that Russia wouldn't again attempt to achieve their broader goals in Ukraine at their earliest convenience.",

What you quoted, namely that &quot;the two sides had reached a tentative peace deal&quot; is not exactly what the original article says &quot;in April 2022, Russian and Ukrainian negotiators appeared to have tentatively agreed on the outlines of a negotiated interim settlement.&quot; An interim settlement is more akin to a ceasefire than it is a &quot;peace deal.&quot; Then your article adds the pure speculation that it was due, at least in part, to pressure from the West that the deal fell apart. The original article from Hill/Stent offers no explanation for why it fell apart. </p>\n\n<p>Ironically, the &quot;smoking gun&quot; evidence from the Ukrainian Parliamentarian David Arakhamia actually provided perfectly plausible rationales for why the original agreement fell apart without Western pressure:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>There were several reasons the negotiations ultimately collapsed, he said, including the need to change the Ukrainian constitution (which had been amended in February 2019 to enshrine the country\u2019s NATO aspirations), and the fact that Johnson had come to Kyiv to inform Ukrainian officials the West wouldn\u2019t sign any agreement with Moscow, instead urging: \u201clet\u2019s just fight.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>Arakhamia also said that Kyiv\u2019s lack of trust in the Russian side to fulfill its end of the bargain meant that the peace deal \u201ccould only be done if there were security guarantees\u201d \u2014 suggesting, obliquely, that negotiations could have borne fruit had they received the backing and involvement of NATO states. Western governments\u2019 provision of security guarantees for Ukraine have\u00a0long been part\u00a0of the discussion for how to ensure the sustainability of a post-war peace deal, and in fact, Arakhmia himself\u00a0disclosed\u00a0in the same interview that \u201cthe Western allies advised us not to agree to ephemeral security guarantees.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, another explanation for why there wasn&#39;t an agreement in April 2022 was because there was zero trust in Russia keeping its word. There was also likely little to no appetite from the West to extend security guarantees to defend Ukraine from a potential future attack from Russia. </p>\n\n<p>So instead of the author&#39;s seeming suggestion that the West has prolonged the war in order to punish Russia, the equally plausible (I&#39;d argue more plausible) explanation is that Ukraine and the West expected Russia to renege on this interim agreement after getting some breathing room and restarting the conflict from a position of greater relative strength. Again, there was also likely zero willingness to extend security guarantees for Ukraine from Western countries, especially since they fully expected Russia to test those guarantees in the future. </p>\n\n<p>Seems odd that this author, who&#39;s a supposed realist, doesn&#39;t seem to think that Russia&#39;s designs on Ukraine extended beyond merely forcing them to openly declare neutrality (was a full-scale invasion including an attempt to take Kyiv needed for this goal?), and that Russia wouldn&#39;t again attempt to achieve their broader goals in Ukraine at their earliest convenience.</p>\n</div>",
