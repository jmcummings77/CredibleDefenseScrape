As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

These points were typically where coordination between the forces was at its weakest, allowing the Chechens to make progress and ultimately succeed in reducing the Ukrainian defences. This role has continued to some extent, with Chechen units, Wagner Group mercenaries and Russia\u2019s airborne forces providing a second line of troops. One tactic they employ is to send less experienced units forward to reveal Ukrainian positions, which are then engaged with precision artillery and loitering munition strikes. The Chechens and others then follow up the attack against weakened Ukrainian positions.</a>  </p>\n\n<p>Through a steady stream of videos released via TikTok, the Chechens have gained a somewhat poor reputation. However, <strong>first-hand reports from Ukrainian soldiers indicate that these videos are in no way representative of their attitude during combat, and that the Chechens represent a very real challenge.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I think at this point you owe me an apology if you want to be taken seriously on this subreddit.</p>\n</div>",

This is inherently going to underrate modern generals. It'll also favor generals with long victorious careers, but that's a good thing, as it proves they're not just winning by flukes.\n\nIn the article he notes Patton doesn't get an especially high rating due to participating in few battles despite being considered an excellent general by historians. That's because his Wikipedia-based data set (not getting on his case about it! he acknowledged this shortcoming, no big deal, it's a tricky subject) only has two battles with Patton as general, Operation Torch and the Battle of the Bulge. \n\nFirst, this ignores multiple other battles Patton participated in, like the allied invasion of Sicily where Patton's 7th Army inflicted 10:1 casualties on Axis forces, or his participation in the invasion of Normandy, or the Lorraine campaign, all victories for Patton. \n\nSecond, it's the squishy, shifting definition of battle. The entire Battle of the Bulge would be considered probably 4 distinct battles by Napoleonic standards, with Patton participating in perhaps 2. For comparison, the Siege of Mantua in the first Italian campaign had Napoleon's multiple defenses of the siege at Bassono, Arcole, and Rivoli all count as victories in his data set, but if you used the 20th century idea of a \"battle\" (which is more like a campaign in Napoleonic terms) you'd probably combine those into the broader Battle of Mantua or something. That said, Napoleon also actually suffers from omission of battles - he won another couple battles earlier in the first Italian campaign, like at Castiglione.",

At this point the protest itself was largely peaceful despite the police brutality. On my first visit, my wife, with her mother and aunts, wanted to go to the Maidan to show their support. Not to protest, that was very dangerous. Most people were too scared to be on the front line but they found other ways to show their support. In our case it was medical supplies. A medical centre used to treat injured protesters had been trashed by police.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nWhen we got there I saw the protest for the first time. It was huge. To give you an idea it ran down Khreshchatyk Street, think Oxford Street (London) but three times as wide, to the Maidan square. The side streets were blocked with ten foot walls of snow and wood. There was a forest of large tents, the type with chimneys, and there were people everywhere. Thousands upon thousands. The supplies we brought suddenly looked meagre. People were streaming in with car loads of stuff for the protesters. The atmosphere was tense but had a touch of festival. Alcohol was banned, the place was clean and well organised. What struck me was the range of people present. All sections of society were here. From students to army veterans, taxi drivers to doctors, farmers to officer workers, old and young, conservative and liberal. There were people from all over Ukraine, even Donetsk and Crimea. While the politics was varied they were united in one thing. The country was fast approaching a dictatorship and their democracy was worth fighting for.\n\n\r  \nI was in the airport waiting for my second flight to Kyiv since the protests started when I read the news that the government passed the so-called [dictatorship laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-protest_laws_in_Ukraine). These were sweeping new laws that basically made peaceful protests and criticism of the government illegal. It was also passed in an unconventional way. Not sure they would have enough support in government they called a snap vote, turned off the normal electronic voting system and with a quick show of hands they passed it into law. There was outrage in the parliament that led to fist fights.\r  \nI knew then it was going to turn ugly. You can\u2019t just ban protests and expect everyone to just give up and go home. Not now, not after the sacrifices they had already made. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was not long after the clashes began. I went back to the Maidan the day after the first outbreak of violence. Again my wife's family wanted to bring supplies. This time the atmosphere was a lot more tense. The temperature at day was minus 14 but the protesters were still out in huge numbers.\n\n\r  \nFrom here the brutality was ramped up. Water cannons were used in these freezing conditions. One protester caught by the police was stripped naked and paraded in the snow. After I had returned home it got worse, rubber bullets, savage public beatings and finally sniper fire. I remember that day well. There was a good chance people I knew were there. Good non violent people who just wanted an end to the corruption. It was a tragic day for the country.",

From students to army veterans, taxi drivers to doctors, farmers to officer workers, old and young, conservative and liberal. There were people from all over Ukraine, even Donetsk and Crimea. While the politics was varied they were united in one thing. The country was fast approaching a dictatorship and their democracy was worth fighting for.</p>\n\n<p>I was in the airport waiting for my second flight to Kyiv since the protests started when I read the news that the government passed the so-called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-protest_laws_in_Ukraine\">dictatorship laws</a>. These were sweeping new laws that basically made peaceful protests and criticism of the government illegal. It was also passed in an unconventional way. Not sure they would have enough support in government they called a snap vote, turned off the normal electronic voting system and with a quick show of hands they passed it into law. There was outrage in the parliament that led to fist fights.</p>\n\n<p>I knew then it was going to turn ugly. You can\u2019t just ban protests and expect everyone to just give up and go home. Not now, not after the sacrifices they had already made. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>It was not long after the clashes began. I went back to the Maidan the day after the first outbreak of violence. Again my wife&#39;s family wanted to bring supplies. This time the atmosphere was a lot more tense. The temperature at day was minus 14 but the protesters were still out in huge numbers.</p>\n\n<p>From here the brutality was ramped up. Water cannons were used in these freezing conditions. One protester caught by the police was stripped naked and paraded in the snow. After I had returned home it got worse, rubber bullets, savage public beatings and finally sniper fire. I remember that day well. There was a good chance people I knew were there. Good non violent people who just wanted an end to the corruption. It was a tragic day for the country.</p>\n</div>",

My Russian is extremely poor but I'm fairly sure he's not literally saying \"Ukraine has not bombed Donetsk for 8 years, only Russian positions\" anywhere in that video excerpt.\n\nA somewhat less sensationalist summary of what he is saying would be:\n\n* There have been constant fire exchanges along the frontlines between 2014 and 2022, sometimes at higher, sometimes at lower intensity\n* The MoD is claiming there was an imminent danger that Ukraine would attack along with NATO forces, making the \"special military operation\" absolutely imperative; but \"nothing special\" occurred on that day, and there is no value to that claim by the MoD.\n\nThis is a fairly ridiculous claim altogether and honestly I doubt there is a plan to it in the first place. *If* the MoD ever tried to claim that, there's no way it wouldn't have been shot down pretty quickly. There were no indications of anything like that, anywhere. And if there had been, but they were not made known to the Western public, Russia took months to bring troops and materiel to the Ukrainian border, which is decidedly not how you react to the threat of imminent invasion.\n\nIMHO it's more likely that Priggy is just trying to discredit the MoD's policy of preparing for long-term conflict with NATO. That line has secured excellent funding, vast resources, and very good political ties for the Ministry for decades now, and sabotaging it -- either by claiming it's unnecessary, or that the Ministry is just not doing a good job at it -- is a good way to grab some of that.

My Russian is extremely poor but I&#39;m fairly sure he&#39;s not literally saying &quot;Ukraine has not bombed Donetsk for 8 years, only Russian positions&quot; anywhere in that video excerpt.</p>\n\n<p>A somewhat less sensationalist summary of what he is saying would be:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>There have been constant fire exchanges along the frontlines between 2014 and 2022, sometimes at higher, sometimes at lower intensity</li>\n<li>The MoD is claiming there was an imminent danger that Ukraine would attack along with NATO forces, making the &quot;special military operation&quot; absolutely imperative; but &quot;nothing special&quot; occurred on that day, and there is no value to that claim by the MoD.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is a fairly ridiculous claim altogether and honestly I doubt there is a plan to it in the first place. <em>If</em> the MoD ever tried to claim that, there&#39;s no way it wouldn&#39;t have been shot down pretty quickly. There were no indications of anything like that, anywhere. And if there had been, but they were not made known to the Western public, Russia took months to bring troops and materiel to the Ukrainian border, which is decidedly not how you react to the threat of imminent invasion.</p>\n\n<p>IMHO it&#39;s more likely that Priggy is just trying to discredit the MoD&#39;s policy of preparing for long-term conflict with NATO. That line has secured excellent funding, vast resources, and very good political ties for the Ministry for decades now, and sabotaging it -- either by claiming it&#39;s unnecessary, or that the Ministry is just not doing a good job at it -- is a good way to grab some of that. So he&#39;s making up a strawman based on their public &quot;we&#39;re already at war with all of NATO&quot; mantra, which even the most staunchly pro-Russian, anti-Western doomer can tell is more than just a little thin.</p>\n</div>",

The way I always hear the story told is this:  Chen turns to his friend Wu Guang and asks \u201cWhat\u2019s the penalty for being late?\u201d  \u201cDeath,\u201d says Wu.  \u201cAnd what\u2019s the penalty for rebellion?\u201d  \u201cDeath,\u201d says Wu.  \u201cWell then\u2026\u201d says Chen Sheng.  And thus began the famous Dazexiang Uprising, which caused thousands of deaths and helped usher in a period of instability and chaos that resulted in the fall of the Qin Dynasty three years later.</a></p>\n</div>",

They don't have to get within 100 yards and shoot them out of the sky with .303 rounds.\n\n>How would they detect and target helicopters dozens of kM's away that are a 20-30 meters above the ground? While also flying near the ground? You won't do it from the F-16, of course, since it's flying low and can't actually see the helicopters.\n\nUS AWACS and/or UAF recon/radar to guide them towards targets.\n\nAnd their own radar once they are close enough to \"pop-up\" to shoot and then (as the AMRAAMs are fire and forget) dive back down to treetop height and scoot.\n\nThey'd approach low, rise high enough to get a lock (which wouldn;t be very high at all), fire, turn and dive away.\n\nIf the KA-50's can see tanks on the ground 8-10km away to shoot their ATGM at them.....F-16's can see the (higher) KA-50s from 20km+ given the heli's themselves are already higher than the tanks they're firing at.\n\nThis is flat terrain. A handy online calculator tells me the visual sight range over flat ground for a target 100ft up is 19km *from ground level*. If the F-16 is also at 100ft that's going to extend out even further, probably to 40km+. If the Heli is as low as 50ft, thats still going to be sightable from 30km+. \n\nIf the Heli's are high enough to fire at tanks 8-10km out.... they're high enough to be painted themselves from a 100-200ft high opposing aircraft from as far away as the Max AIM-120 range, and from even lower aircraft if we're talking the 20km range needed to put the F-16 10km behind the front line.\n\nEDIT:\n>28 Apr 1981, Israeli F-16s scored the first air-to-air kill by shooting down two Syrian Mi-8 'Hip' helicopters over the Bekaa Valley.\n\nand\n\n>In 1994, two USAF F-15 fighters patrolling Iraq's Northern No-Fly Zone mistook a pair of US Army Black Hawk helicopters for Iraqi helicopters, and shot them down.

        "body": "Putin is a common subject of debate over if he is a Machiavellian leader, but it seems that he failed to heed Machivelli's advice on relying on mercenaries/auxiliaries. \n\n\"Mercenaries and auxiliaries are useless and dangerous; and if one holds his state based on these arms, he will stand neither firm nor safe; for they are disunited, ambitious, and without discipline, unfaithful, valiant before friends, cowardly before enemies; they have neither the fear of God nor fidelity to men, and destruction is deferred only so long as the attack is; for in peace one is robbed by them, and in war by the enemy. The fact is, they have no other attraction or reason for keeping the field than a trifle of stipend, which is not sufficient to make them willing to die for you. They are ready enough to be your soldiers whilst you do not make war, but if war comes they take themselves off or run from the foe; which I should have little trouble to prove, for the ruin of Italy has been caused by nothing else than by resting all her hopes for many years on mercenaries, and although they formerly made some display and appeared valiant amongst themselves, yet when the foreigners came they showed what they were.\" (The Prince, Chapter 12)\n\nWagner is more of an auxiliary group than a Merc group since Russia was the supposed controller of it, but that only goes so far. A pure merc group would likely have not survived this long. This whole situation, taken seriously rather than as a performance like some others are taking it, seems to prove Putin's paranoia of ever letting the military and the generals from gaining their own independent power.\n\nMachiavelli is not entirely right in the context of the modern world since mercs are useful in limited/proxy wars. Russia used the Wagner group to decent effect against insurgents in Syria who were lesser in capability. Wagner was also much smaller then with 6000 in 2017 at the peak of their operations there. It was also ultimately working as support for the Syrian government. There is much to say about Wagner in Syria and how the interaction with American forces precluded this whole mess, but I don't have the time for it and I am not a real expert on it anyway. However, that was certainly the first time that Wagner would be humbled by the 'foreigners' as Machiavelli would say. 151\u2013201 killed in Syria.\n\nBut it would not be the last time, as Ukraine would be a very different war for the Wagner Group with estimates placing the group at 50k+ in size in December 22. 6,171 killed (confirmed) 9,000+ killed, 30,000+ wounded (estimated). By numbers alone, it can be seen that Wagner has gone from being the size of a large regiment to an entire field army (in U.S army terms). It is hard for me not to insert my own view that allowing/ facilitating this was a major mistake on Putin's part but as I do not know what he was thinking nor do I know the inner workings of the Russian military, I can't why this came to be. Past these facts, we have all been seeing the result of putting the Wagner group into a real battle against a real enemy. Time for them to flee. Unlike in the time of Machiavelli, though, Wagner can't simply run off to some other country to sell their services. \n\nI doubt Putin will come to ruin for this. It's not like his army is made up entirely of Mercs/auxiliaries/paramilitary. This situation may even be salvaged and Russia might compromise or forcibly restructure the Wagner group. Regardless, Putin should know now how big of a mistake it was to rely on the Wagner group. Hopefully, he didn't learn his lesson.",

The fact is, they have no other attraction or reason for keeping the field than a trifle of stipend, which is not sufficient to make them willing to die for you. They are ready enough to be your soldiers whilst you do not make war, but if war comes they take themselves off or run from the foe; which I should have little trouble to prove, for the ruin of Italy has been caused by nothing else than by resting all her hopes for many years on mercenaries, and although they formerly made some display and appeared valiant amongst themselves, yet when the foreigners came they showed what they were.&quot; (The Prince, Chapter 12)</p>\n\n<p>Wagner is more of an auxiliary group than a Merc group since Russia was the supposed controller of it, but that only goes so far. A pure merc group would likely have not survived this long. This whole situation, taken seriously rather than as a performance like some others are taking it, seems to prove Putin&#39;s paranoia of ever letting the military and the generals from gaining their own independent power.</p>\n\n<p>Machiavelli is not entirely right in the context of the modern world since mercs are useful in limited/proxy wars. Russia used the Wagner group to decent effect against insurgents in Syria who were lesser in capability. Wagner was also much smaller then with 6000 in 2017 at the peak of their operations there. It was also ultimately working as support for the Syrian government. There is much to say about Wagner in Syria and how the interaction with American forces precluded this whole mess, but I don&#39;t have the time for it and I am not a real expert on it anyway. However, that was certainly the first time that Wagner would be humbled by the &#39;foreigners&#39; as Machiavelli would say. 151\u2013201 killed in Syria.</p>\n\n<p>But it would not be the last time, as Ukraine would be a very different war for the Wagner Group with estimates placing the group at 50k+ in size in December 22. 6,171 killed (confirmed) 9,000+ killed, 30,000+ wounded (estimated). By numbers alone, it can be seen that Wagner has gone from being the size of a large regiment to an entire field army (in U.S army terms). It is hard for me not to insert my own view that allowing/ facilitating this was a major mistake on Putin&#39;s part but as I do not know what he was thinking nor do I know the inner workings of the Russian military, I can&#39;t why this came to be. Past these facts, we have all been seeing the result of putting the Wagner group into a real battle against a real enemy. Time for them to flee. Unlike in the time of Machiavelli, though, Wagner can&#39;t simply run off to some other country to sell their services. </p>\n\n<p>I doubt Putin will come to ruin for this. It&#39;s not like his army is made up entirely of Mercs/auxiliaries/paramilitary. This situation may even be salvaged and Russia might compromise or forcibly restructure the Wagner group. Regardless, Putin should know now how big of a mistake it was to rely on the Wagner group. Hopefully, he didn&#39;t learn his lesson.</p>\n</div>",

Specifically:\n\n> That's also not to say that Obama and the US couldn't, or shouldn't have done more though, obviously we should have. But if anyone deserves blame for not doing enough to punish Russia, and actually tying Europe even closer to Russia despite what was happening in Ukraine AND numerous direct warnings from the US, it's Angela Merkel.\n\nI think the most important consideration, which people are very willing to forget today, is this: Ukraine is in Europe, Russia was a major partner for several European countries (including, but not just, Germany), so handling the 2014 crisis was, first and foremost, the responsibility of European countries.\n\nThe US *could* have done more as in, it may have had the resources, and could have possibly mustered the political will. However, doing so against the wish, or simply without the full support of, its European allies would have been absurd.

Socially speaking, Americans were focused on the home front and didn't want to be in another war.

Political constraints actually got worse with a fully Republican Congress and a Democratic president. Operationally constraints slightly lessened. The Ukrainian Armed Forces, however, gave more reasons as to be a better bet for aid. \n\nThat covers Obama's last 1.5 years in office. As you can see, the fiscal, political, and operational constraints meant there wasn't going to be any large aid to Ukraine. What could be done was small amounts, which is what was done. \n\nBetween 2016-2020 Donald Trump was President. I don't think I need to really expand on how that was a constraint. Though sequestration was officially repealed in 2018 and the Ukrainian Armed Forces were becoming more experienced. Socially, Americans were focusing on domestic issues with support of pulling back for foreign interventions. \n\nIn 2021, political constraints eased with a Democratic trifecta; however, the Hunger Biden/Ukraine \"scandal\" was a political constraint. Fiscal constraints were reduced due to a Democratic openness and desire to spend money; however, Sinema and Manchin were deficit hawks and most other Democratic members didn't support *more* military spending. Operationally, the dumpster fire beginning to roll downhill that was the Afghanistan withdrawal placed constraints militarily from a planning perspective. Socially, America was war weary, almost everyone wanting to withdraw from Afghanistan but *not like that*. Inflation was becoming an issue, focusing even more on domestic issues. Ukraine's Armed Forces had basically been proven reliable, if not believed to fend off a full invasion. \n\nSo there it is. A combination of political, fiscal, operational, and social constraints kept any significant aid from Ukraine until 2022. And the key point, in my opinion, was the American social ego to want a \"win\" after the failure in Afghanistan.",

Ukraine&#39;s Armed Forces had basically been proven reliable, if not believed to fend off a full invasion. </p>\n\n<p>So there it is. A combination of political, fiscal, operational, and social constraints kept any significant aid from Ukraine until 2022. And the key point, in my opinion, was the American social ego to want a &quot;win&quot; after the failure in Afghanistan.</p>\n</div>",

There were people and some groups that warned about Putin's Russia in early 90s already, and especially in early 2000s after the honeymoon period died, and so on.\n\nBut how do you square those warnings, those reservations; in relation to what was established between Europe and USSR in 1975 already? See, Helsinki accords. \n\nThere were really I'd say three overarching motivations working with Soviets and later Russians.

The escalating reports of conflict between Wagner and MOD in recent weeks including the incidents of shooting at each other in retrospect make this quite a clear trajectory.\n\nKey questions I see\n\n1. Will Kadyrov join and bring in the Chechnyan forces (I assume yes)\n2. Will other ethnic dominated provinces where Russians are a minority, such as Tatarstan and the other Caucus provinces neighbouring Chechnya join the revolt?\n3. Will rank and file MOD provide active resistance to Wagner (seems not be occurring so far based on reporting)\n4. Will the field grade officers and general staff side with Wagner (Gerasimov is obviously not going to, but what about the other Generals and Colonels?)\n5. How many other Oligarchs and which ones will join Wagner? Do the others with independent financial and military power bases support Putin or Prigozhin?\n6. Will the Russian anti Putin forces coordinate support for Wagner as a means of removing Putin, including the democratic movement and its leaders such as the guy who keeps getting poisoned whose name I forgot\n7. Will Wagner continue to be able to recruit within Russia to sustain a longer term conflict if required? Prisoners are the most obvious supply of recruits for Wagner, but also to be considered are the anti Putin forces such as Freedom of Russia Legion, MOD deserters and mutineers from the rank and file, draft dodgers, democratic and anti Putin activists etc. Two wildcard recruitment pools are firstly the regional volunteer forces that have been raised by the various Oblast Governors and not all of which have been deployed to Ukraine, and secondly Ukrainian POWs in camps that could be raided either to set the POWs free as agents of chaos to fight their way home (The Czechoslovak Legion 2.0) or to join with Wagner temporarily. Its a crazy idea but who knows what would happen.\n8. Will Azerbaijan use this opportunity to go for gold in its Nagorno Karabakh fight now that they can be fully assured of no Russian involvement? \n9. Will Georgia or Moldova (and Romania) try anything against Ossetia and Transnistria respectively?\n10. Will China intervene? This to me is the single most important question. If Putin survives the week, then with a full scale war and internal revolt that may broaden into full scale civil war (and we know western intel will forment this as much as possible) the only trustworthy forces that Putin could rely on are Chinese troops sent to rescue him by Xi. Ironically strong Syria vibes, although the Civil War with the allied interventions may obviously be a more direct precedent.\n\nFuck me. I did not have this on my bingo card for this week.",

For example, Russia and Ukraine and Britain are parties to AP I.  The USA is not.  So, if the US captures a mercenary, it is obligated under the Geneva Conventions to treat them like any other lawful combatant.  If Britain captures a mercenary, it is not obligated to treat them like any other lawful combatant, but almost certainly would do so.  If Russia or Ukraine captures a mercenary, all bets are off.

So, a military-style rebellion from outside the system.</p>\n\n<p>They did have an ideology and widespread network, sure - but &quot;Wagner&quot; also has the latter to some extent (though probably can&#39;t really leverage it) and the former to a minor extent (it definitely has its own tinge of turbopatriots).</p>\n</div>",

They wern't a faction from *within the existing order* trying to keep that existing order in place, but put their faction in control of it. \n\nThey were a civilian party that relied on defections of the working classes..... which included the Kronstadt sailors, the St Petersburg garrison etc etc which they appealed to ideologically as \"fellow workers\".... to complete their revolution. They relied on masses to join them, amongst those masses being working class elements of the military who had committed to overthrowing the whole system.\n\nThey may have wanted their \"leadership team\" to remain a small dedicated revolutionary force, rather than a mass membership party, but they were relying on the general population backing up and \"converting\" to be their foot soldiers when the time came. \n\nWagner aren't appealing for that kind of mass support for their cause, trying to draft crowds of thousands to disrupt all civil society, perform mass strikes, form their own revolutionary committee and storm the gates of the winter palace. \n\nThey're trying to pull of a military coup entirely with their own forces, and other military units they can persuade to fight for their faction rather than the government.... and then expect to turn around to the rest of society and say \"Fait Accompli, we won.
