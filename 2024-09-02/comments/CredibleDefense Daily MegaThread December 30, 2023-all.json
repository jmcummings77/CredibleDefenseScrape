Allegedly, the MNDAA holds the entirety of the urban area, but there remains a Tat command post to the NE of the city. \n\nThe capture of Laukkai means that Lashio and Muse should be taken after the remaining garrison forces are destroyed as many troops will be freed up. However, in my opinion we should expect a slowdown in operations by the MNDAA as they consolidate their territory and deal with politics behind the scenes.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Some really big news from Myanmar with <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/mandalayfreepress/videos/383682640860920\">claims</a> that the MNDAA has captured Laukkai, the capital of Kokang after heavy clashes. Allegedly, the MNDAA holds the entirety of the urban area, but there remains a Tat command post to the NE of the city. </p>\n\n<p>The capture of Laukkai means that Lashio and Muse should be taken after the remaining garrison forces are destroyed as many troops will be freed up. However, in my opinion we should expect a slowdown in operations by the MNDAA as they consolidate their territory and deal with politics behind the scenes. There is a lot of pressure by China to halt, pressure by the NUG to keep going and pressure internally to figure out a way to prevent ethnic tensions between the MNDAA and other groups from jeopardizing future fighting. There is concern about being seen as conquerors.</p>\n</div>",

The name change reflects the fact the this unit, which was founded in 1980 for counter-terrorism reasons, draws personnel from the Air and Naval branches.

        "body": "After a similar report from WSJ on Germany, the [WaPo](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/30/france-russia-interference-far-right/) has a new report on Russian influence operations within France. Excerpts:\n\n\n> Russia has been increasing its efforts to undermine French support for Kyiv \u2014 a hidden propaganda front in Western Europe that is part of the war against Ukraine, according to Kremlin documents and interviews with European security officials and far-right political figures.\n\n> The Kremlin documents, obtained by a European security service and reviewed by The Washington Post, show that Sergei Kiriyenko, the first deputy chief of staff in President Vladimir Putin's administration, has tasked Kremlin political strategists with promoting political discord in France through social media and French political figures, opinion leaders and activists. Those figures were not identified by name in the documents seen by The Post. Moscow's goal is to undermine support for Ukraine and weaken NATO resolve, the documents show. The effort parallels similar interference in Germany, where the Kremlin has attempted to marry the far right and the far left in an antiwar alliance, The Post previously reported.\n\n>The talking points to be amplified by the Kremlin's strategists included arguing that Western sanctions against Russia have damaged the French economy through a decline in trade, leaving the country at risk of falling into \"the deepest social and economic crisis of recent years,\" as well as asserting that the supply of arms to Ukraine has left France without the weapons to defend itself.\n\n>Several weekly \"dashboard\" presentations to Kremlin officials in 2022 show that Moscow thought France was vulnerable to political turmoil. Citing opinion polls, the strategists noted that 30 percent of the French retained a positive view of Russia, the second highest among Western European countries after Italy, while 40 percent were inclined not to believe reporting on Ukraine by France's own mass media.\n\n> Later, in 2023, Kiriyenko's Kremlin group ordered the strategists to promote messaging that would increase the number of those in France reluctant to \"pay for another country's war,\" one of the documents shows. They were also told to increase \"the fear of direct of confrontation with Russia and the start of World War III with Europe's participation,\" and to boost the number of those who want \"dialogue with Russia on the construction of a common European security architecture.\" The United States was to be described as using Ukraine as an instrument to weaken Russia's position in Europe, the documents state.\n\n> **The documents show that troll farms created by the Kremlin political strategists produced and published social media content and articles critical of Western support for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's government. One note written by one of the strategists in June 2023 directed a troll farm employee to create a \"200-character comment by a middle-aged French person\" who considers Europe's support for Ukraine to be \"a stupid adventure.\" The fictional French person was also supposed to argue that support for Ukraine is turning into \"inflation \u2026 and falling living standards.\"**\n\n> The Kremlin's messaging has so far had limited resonance in France, where President Emmanuel Macron has been at the forefront of Europe's efforts to support Ukraine and a majority of the population has backed him. But the visibility of pro-Russian accounts on social media is climbing in France, according to Thomas Gomart, director of the French Institute for International Relations, and approval ratings for France's far-right parties have been rising. Rhetoric from Russia allies like Schaffhauser \u2014 who maintains connections across the country's far right \u2014 about the cost of the Ukraine war is increasingly being combined with the idea that it is an American adventure and that France needs to assert itself as a great power and restore relations with Russia.\n\n>For part of the French establishment, the vision of France leading a grand Europe together with Moscow is \"a dream which will never go away,\" said Sylvie Kauffmann, editorial director at Le Monde and author of the recent book \"Les Aveugl\u00e9s,\" or \"The Blinded Ones,\" about how France and Germany misread Putin in seeking to build close ties with him. \"In this dream we are a big power and Russia is a big power and we are two big nuclear powers treating each other on an equal footing,\" she said.\n\n> >Moscow tries to fan tensions\n\n>At the end of June, after Paris erupted into riots over the police killing of a teenager of Moroccan and Algerian origin, a network of pro-Russian social media accounts became highly active, according to a study conducted by Alto Intelligence, a leading cybersecurity firm that tracks anomalous digital media activity across Europe. **A tiny fraction of profiles \u2014 1.2 percent \u2014 produced 30.6 percent of all digital media commentary on the riots**. Among the most prolific accounts, 24.2 percent were injecting pro-Russian posts into the commentary. Most of the accounts were aligned with far-right French politicians such as \u00c9ric Zemmour or Le Pen, Alto found.\n\n>Concerns are also growing that the Kremlin could seek to exacerbate mounting tensions over the Israel-Gaza conflict, a senior European security official said, adding that Russia was willing to exploit a wide array of political issues.\n\n>In November, French officials said Moscow's fingerprints were found on an attempt to fan tensions between France's Jewish and Muslim communities, both the biggest in Europe, following Israel's invasion of Gaza. A Moldovan couple was arrested for painting hundreds of Stars of David across the streets of Paris, and French officials said they believed the couple was acting on the instructions of a pro-Russian Moldovan businessman.\n\n>When France's state digital watchdog detected more than 1,000 bots amplifying photos of those Stars of David, French authorities called the effort \"a new operation of Russian digital interference against France,\" and part of \"an opportunistic and irresponsible strategy aimed at exploiting international crises to sow confusion and create tensions\" in France and Europe.\n\n>The state watchdog, Viginum, said it had a \"high degree of confidence\" that the bots were connected to a Russian disinformation network known as Recent Reliable News, which produces content aimed at undermining Western governments' stances on the Ukraine war. Viginum noted that one of the bots' main activities was to redirect to RRN websites.\n\n>The RRN websites have also been a vehicle for a Russian operation known as Doppelg\u00e4nger, which was exposed by French officials in June. It cloned and usurped the sites of well-known Western media brands such as France's Le Monde \u2014 and, eventually, of the French Foreign Ministry \u2014 to produce fake content that included depicting Ukraine as a Nazi state and blasting sanctions against Russia as harming European economies. Viginum accused two Russian companies \u2014 Struktura and Social Design Agency \u2014 of being behind Doppelg\u00e4nger.\n\n>> Withholding support for Ukraine\n\n>After a six-month inquiry this year into foreign interference in the French political process, France's Parliament focused in on the Kremlin, declaring in its final report: \"Russia is conducting a long-term disinformation campaign in our country\" that seeks \"to defend and promote Russian interests and to polarize our democratic society.\"\n\n>It also highlighted the role of Le Pen's National Rally, finding that the party \"maintains many privileged links with the Kremlin\" and had effectively acted as \"a communication channel\" for its views.\n\n> Sensing a change in the political winds after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Le Pen has become quieter on advocating closer ties with Moscow. Tarnished by the 2014 loan from Russia \u2014 which was paid back early, National Rally said in September \u2014 she has limited her comments mostly to the negative impact of sanctions on the French economy.\n\n> For Schaffhauser \u2014 who faced special scrutiny in the parliamentary inquiry for his role facilitating the two loans for Le Pen \u2014 a primary objective is helping Moscow rebuild its connections to Europe.\n\n> The French parliamentary inquiry noted \"the dense relational fabric\" that Schaffhauser \u2014 a member of the European Parliament for Le Pen's party from 2014 to 2019 \u2014 had built up over years of dealings between Russia and France.\n\n>At one point, over the summer, shortly after the June riots rocked Macron's administration, Schaffhauser said he'd even been in talks with several former senior French military intelligence officers about how to bring a network of former French generals to power in case of crisis and political collapse in France. \"We have to propose the best government for France, a shadow government \u2026 people who are really patriots,\" Schaffhauser said.\n\n>In its report, the parliamentary inquiry warned of the propensity of former French officials, \"particularly retired officers,\" to echo Moscow's positions and \"develop speeches using Kremlin language.\"\n\n\nWhile it\u2019s interesting that the French are willing to talk openly about Russian info ops related to Ukraine, they have been relatively mum about the issue across in Niger where third-party companies, including [Microsoft](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/01/russias-african-coup-strategy/), have been more forthcoming with Russian destabilization strategies across Africa. To some extent, French interests are being more directly challenged there, something which the *historically* pro-imperialist far-right has shown no ideological discombobulation squaring with.",

If possible, be plentiful, as you have provided no sources to corroborate that claim so far.\n\nAnyway, from the article (of note is that Golos at the time was an independent election watchdog, and is currently the **only** supposedly independent election watchdog still remaining in Russia):\n\n> Grigory Melkonyants, deputy head of Golos, said: \"They're passing this law to complicate the lives of NGOs or completely stop our financing.\" **Golos helped expose the electoral fraud that marred Russia's recent parliamentary and presidential elections, and has already been the target of a mass discreditation campaign.**\n\n> Melkonyants noted that the bill did not include a definition of political activity, meaning it could be applied far and wide. **\"Political activity means wanting to come to power \u2013 no human rights groups or environmental groups want to come to power.** Such a wide formulation of this law is very aggressive,\" he said.\n\nAs it currently stands, it's just false that such an authoritarian expansion of 'oversight' which apparently coincided with the largest protests Moscow has experienced since the 90's was rooted in anything other than cracking down on dissent.\n\n>  In the end, they largely copied the US legislation, naturally abusing it in an inimitably Putinist way.\n\nFunny headline, here:\n\n<PUT_TASS_HERE>/politics/1673715\n\n> - Russia's foreign agents law 'almost copy' of US law, **but more liberal**, Putin says \n\n> - \"This law has been active in the US since 1937 or 1938, [I think], ours is almost a copy, only it's much more liberal. We talk about it all the time,\" he said at the plenary session of the Eastern Economic Forum (EEF).\n\nIt being related to US legislation is immaterial if a **more liberal** copy produces an incomparably harder crackdown on civil rights. It's a Russian law that they, as you've said, abuse to crack down on dissent. No such thing happening in the US.",

If possible, be plentiful, as you have provided no sources to corroborate that claim so far.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, from the article (of note is that Golos at the time was an independent election watchdog, and is currently the <strong>only</strong> supposedly independent election watchdog still remaining in Russia):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Grigory Melkonyants, deputy head of Golos, said: &quot;They&#39;re passing this law to complicate the lives of NGOs or completely stop our financing.&quot; <strong>Golos helped expose the electoral fraud that marred Russia&#39;s recent parliamentary and presidential elections, and has already been the target of a mass discreditation campaign.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Melkonyants noted that the bill did not include a definition of political activity, meaning it could be applied far and wide. <strong>&quot;Political activity means wanting to come to power \u2013 no human rights groups or environmental groups want to come to power.</strong> Such a wide formulation of this law is very aggressive,&quot; he said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As it currently stands, it&#39;s just false that such an authoritarian expansion of &#39;oversight&#39; which apparently coincided with the largest protests Moscow has experienced since the 90&#39;s was rooted in anything other than cracking down on dissent.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the end, they largely copied the US legislation, naturally abusing it in an inimitably Putinist way.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Funny headline, here:</p>\n\n<p>&lt;PUT_TASS_HERE&gt;/politics/1673715</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Russia&#39;s foreign agents law &#39;almost copy&#39; of US law, <strong>but more liberal</strong>, Putin says </p></li>\n<li><p>&quot;This law has been active in the US since 1937 or 1938, [I think], ours is almost a copy, only it&#39;s much more liberal. We talk about it all the time,&quot; he said at the plenary session of the Eastern Economic Forum (EEF).</p></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It being related to US legislation is immaterial if a <strong>more liberal</strong> copy produces an incomparably harder crackdown on civil rights. It&#39;s a Russian law that they, as you&#39;ve said, abuse to crack down on dissent. No such thing happening in the US.</p>\n</div>",

The downside is more difficult paperwork and cooperation with the army.</p>\n\n<p>All in all, the pre-2022 LNR/DNR units are still there, but their quality is diminished compared to early war. They probably lost more than 50% of the pre-war professionals, with the remainder continuing to serve as a &quot;brace&quot;, or a &quot;stiffener&quot;, for the new rank and file - inexperienced reinforcements.</p>\n</div>",

Will Russian say it was Ukrainian rocket? 50/50, hotel may be Azov base in their statement. Will this claim have any credibility? No. Will it matter what they say? No</p>\n</div>",
