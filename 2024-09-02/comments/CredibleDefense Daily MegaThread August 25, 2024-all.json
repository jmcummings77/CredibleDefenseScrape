        "body": "I was tagged a couple days ago in one of the periodic \"not one inch\" threads we get here. I didn't have time to respond right away, and the thread was locked by the time I got back. It's not that big a deal as I didn't have that much to add to that discussion anyway. Plus, someone in a thread that was linked there had also posted a summary based on M. E. Sarotte's excellent book on this topic (which I highly recommend), making it both more up-to-date than what I could post and (via Marie Sarotte's book) based on a bunch of recently declassified material that I'm not too familiar with.\n\nI did, however, want to post what I think is an interesting snippet of information regarding the original context in which this particular piece of (at the risk of straining into NCD territory) very lame case of playing the victim card by a superpower was developed, because I think it's relevant to understanding the frame of mind in which the current Russian political establishment operates with regards to its foreign policy in its immediate region and towards NATO.\n\nFollowing the dissolution of the Soviet Union, there was considerable debate in Washington about the subsequent relation with former Warsaw Pact countries. Joshua Shifrinson describes some of the issues that were considered at the time [in one of his papers](https://open.bu.edu/bitstream/handle/2144/41811/9%20Shifrinson_NATO%20Enlargement%20Consensus3.pdf?sequence=3) if anyone's curious about the details. The short version is that, by 1992 or so, a preference towards NATO expansion had been formulated as a *realpolitik* alternative to waiting for the EU to fill the power vacuum left behind by the Soviet Union and possibly degrade the US' ability to protect its interests in Europe, but the discussion was largely shelved after Bush lost the election.\n\nHowever, by 1994, the Clinton administration reached more or less the same conclusion, though from another angle. Besides genuine political interest, the Clinton administration feared that Russia would challenge the post-Cold War equilibrium in Europe with potentially disastrous results. This particular observation wasn't exactly prescient: it may sound that way in the current context but back in 1994, whatever was left of the Soviet Union, and then Russia, had not shied away from armed conflict, from low-key paramilitary interventions (e.g. OMON intervention in Riga) to open conflict (Transnistria) when it came to former Soviet republics. While not universal, the fear that Russia might seek to re-establish its sphere of influence by open warfare was real.\n\nThus, in the following years, the U.S. began to work both with European partners and with Russia to pave the way for a NATO expansion eastwards. By 1996, NATO enlargement became part of Clinton's political agenda, and the U.S. openly worked with members of the Visegrad Group to secure membership for former Warsaw Pact republics.\n\n1996 was kind of a big year in Russia, too, though, because presidential elections were held that year. That's the context in which Primakov, the Foreign Minister at the time, first formulated the \"we were promised there wouldn't be any expansion\" thing in public.\n\nA *private* discussion on that subject had taken place earlier, in 1993, when, in a letter to the recently-elected Bill Clinton, Boris Yeltsin protested that NATO expansion Eastwards violated \"the spirit\" of the German reunification treaty. That letter was declassified in 2018 and it's now available [here](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/document/16376-document-04-retranslation-yeltsin-letter). \n\nIronically enough, its declassification attracted some rather angry statements from the Kremlin at the time, for several reasons:\n\n* It showed that, despite later efforts from subsequent Russian administrations to show the contrary, the Yeltsin administration understood that no formal guarantees on this topic had been offered. Yeltsin didn't claim that NATO was in breach of any formal guarantees, but tried to argue that it went against the order established through the reunification treaty \n* Worse, the Russian administration openly acknowledged the security concerns of Eastern European countries at the time,. While it tried to downplay them to some degree, the letters did, nonetheless, show a Russian administration that claimed it was willing to work with its international partners to address them, which cast a very unfavorable light on subsequent Russian administrations.\n* Worst of all, Yeltsin argued that it wasn't open East-West confrontation that posed the greatest threat to Europeans, but the specter of ethnic war (remember, this was 1993, Yugoslavia was going through a very bloody dissolution). This was a real concern on both sides, and casts subsequent Russian administration, which used ethnic conflict as a serious instrument of foreign policy, in an even worse light.\n\nClinton's administration worked to address Yeltsin's concerns somewhat (and those of other European partners, for that matter). That was an exercise that culminated in the NATO-Russia Founding Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation and Security between NATO and the Russian Federation in 1997.\n\nHowever, Yeltsin's policy wasn't particularly easy to pursue. It's hard to tell which of the many hardline statements on this topic (including Primakov's) were genuine opposition and which were merely attempts to save face. Russia was economically unable to re-establish its sphere of influence over the population of countries that had gone through 45 years of endemic poverty under Soviet-imposed regimes, and militarily unable to enforce the dissolution of its sphere of influence through direct intervention outside its borders.\n\nPrimakov's public statements were kind of a big deal at the time, though. This stance was the opening act of his term (he became Foreign Minister in January 1996, after having served as the head of the SVR), and he enjoyed considerable clout. Shortly after, the US Department of State circulated a memo that sought to address these concerns (also declassified in 2018 and available [here](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/document/16395-document-23-russian-assertions-about-two-plus)).\n\nThat memo is a pretty confusing read for a contemporary audience. It predates most attempts at formalizing the history of discussions on this topic in the 2+4 format. Some of its claims are in fact partly inaccurate (e.g. it states that some of Hans-Dietrich Genscher's statements applied only to the GDR, but in their original context, it is clear they did not, but also that they concerned a hypothetical scenario in which Hungary or Poland would consider NATO membership) but it already outlines three wider points that are familiar to a contemporary audience:\n\n* That the agreement on reunification of Germany, in 2+4 format, was concerned specifically and exclusively with the reunification of Germany, and that so were any provisions made in it\n* That the Russian administration clearly understood this at the time, as the geographical boundaries on which the provisions of the treaty applied were established by common agreement\n* That Russia's right to involve itself in arrangements on German reunification was an extension of the post-war agreement on the common administration of the defeated Nazi Germany's territory, which imposed limits on German sovereignty. That is, the U.S. acknowledged that Russia had a *legal* right to a say in how German reunification was handled, backed by international law (that's actually one of the reasons why the 2+4 format was a thing), and that the reunification of Germany was negotiated under these circumstances as a consequence of (what we now call) the rules-based world order, not because the might of (realistically, just two of) the countries involved in the negotiations granted them a right to call the shots. No such international agreement existed on other Eastern European countries. In their case, international agreements, as acknowledged by Russia itself, acknowledged full sovereignty for these countries.\n\nI wanted to bring up these two sources because /u/Elaphe_Emoryi made a very good point [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/1ezawvk/credibledefense_daily_megathread_august_23_2024/ljkvd7p/), namely that this theory of broken NATO promises was gradually developed in the mid-nineties. It was developed both in response to domestic pressure and in an attempt to legitimize Russian claims on influence in Eastern Europe which the Soviet Union had secured through occupation and a policy of *fait accompli*, rather than through the establishment of a legal international framework (as it did with occupied Germany). In fact:\n\n1. Early post-Soviet Russian administrations did not claim that they had received formal guarantees, and only argued that a hypothetical (at the time) NATO expansion was contrary to \"the spirit\" of the treaty on the reunification Germany.\n2. This theory was \"formalized\" through a deliberate exercise, based on this earlier claim, beginning around 1995.\n3. It grew from a wider basis, which the Russian government acknowledged security concerns of Central and Eastern European governments, downplayed the risk of open East-West confrontation, and warned that ethnic instability (in its historical context, both ethnic warfare per se and the humanitarian crises it brought) was the major danger that Europe was facing.",

The forces currently deployed would not be sufficient to overrun Kyiv's prepared defences.

At the start of the war they were caught filming themselves in fake firefights while far from the frontline which tainted their reputation; even now in Kursk they were mocked for quickly withdrawing from the border to further lines of defence and Alaudinov then [claiming that they just \"missed each other\"](https://en.zona.media/article/2024/08/14/akhmat) with the Ukrainians rather than intentionally retreated. They forced a Russian war blogger (Romanov) and then a Russian soldier to make public excuses after they said they fled their positions on the border and were hiding behind conscripts.\n\nThe Spetsnaz unit is also not really what one would think given the name. They started to recruit very largely with little requirements especially among non-Chechens (less than 20% of the unit are Chechens now). Reportedly Chechens mostly make up the officer group and enjoy special privileges within. They boast of offering better payments, training, equipment, living conditions to attract Russians from other regions (with the ongoing inflation in payments from all regions I'm not sure this is still the case though). Part of the goal of the Akhmat units is for Kadyrov to inflate perception of his contribution to the war without actually losing too many Chechens or too many of his men (and they are paramilitary in that they depend on Kadyrov personally rather than the MoD or even Rosgvardia really).\n\nThey weren't initially trained or equipped for high intensity peer on peer war but for counter terrorism (and spent the last years prior to 2022 raiding suspected terrorists/separatists, suspected homosexuals and Kadyrov critics or their families), they didn't have artillery systems, tanks, .., they reproduce all the systemic flaws of the Russian force structures in even worse (nepotism, corruption, ..), Kadyrov needs them (at least the legacy members) and doesn't actually want them to die even if he wants to use them to project strength and that he's doing more than his part for the SMO so they are seen as usually being deployed in rather safe areas.\n\nOn the less \"credible\" reasons, I think their reputation is tainted from their actions at the start of the war, so whatever they claim now is seen with suspicion. Russian soldiers and war bloggers are generally not naturally fond of Chechens and Kadyrov and they are the main source of information on what these forces are up to (Alaudinov said he wanted to execute them recently, so the hostility is reciprocal). It also seems like the Russian government has decided to make Alaudinov the face of Russia's military response to the Ukrainian offensive in Kursk, so the fiasco it has been so far isn't really helping with the unit's reputation.\n\nThere are different Akhmat groups with different missions (Rosgvardia Spetsnaz, MoD, MVD, ..) and they are also often mixed up. Today for Spetsnaz Akhmat I think there are little reasons to consider them differently from other military units, they do take part in the fighting. But they are not really elite in any sense, naturally much more PR driven, and Kadyrov will want to preserve the Chechen cadre in any case. At least this is my impression, but I'm not too knowledgeable about military units and their role in the war so it's mainly based on perception from more general articles on political games and may be completely off the mark; however the description given in that article is very far from general perception.",

They boast of offering better payments, training, equipment, living conditions to attract Russians from other regions (with the ongoing inflation in payments from all regions I&#39;m not sure this is still the case though). Part of the goal of the Akhmat units is for Kadyrov to inflate perception of his contribution to the war without actually losing too many Chechens or too many of his men (and they are paramilitary in that they depend on Kadyrov personally rather than the MoD or even Rosgvardia really).</p>\n\n<p>They weren&#39;t initially trained or equipped for high intensity peer on peer war but for counter terrorism (and spent the last years prior to 2022 raiding suspected terrorists/separatists, suspected homosexuals and Kadyrov critics or their families), they didn&#39;t have artillery systems, tanks, .., they reproduce all the systemic flaws of the Russian force structures in even worse (nepotism, corruption, ..), Kadyrov needs them (at least the legacy members) and doesn&#39;t actually want them to die even if he wants to use them to project strength and that he&#39;s doing more than his part for the SMO so they are seen as usually being deployed in rather safe areas.</p>\n\n<p>On the less &quot;credible&quot; reasons, I think their reputation is tainted from their actions at the start of the war, so whatever they claim now is seen with suspicion. Russian soldiers and war bloggers are generally not naturally fond of Chechens and Kadyrov and they are the main source of information on what these forces are up to (Alaudinov said he wanted to execute them recently, so the hostility is reciprocal). It also seems like the Russian government has decided to make Alaudinov the face of Russia&#39;s military response to the Ukrainian offensive in Kursk, so the fiasco it has been so far isn&#39;t really helping with the unit&#39;s reputation.</p>\n\n<p>There are different Akhmat groups with different missions (Rosgvardia Spetsnaz, MoD, MVD, ..) and they are also often mixed up. Today for Spetsnaz Akhmat I think there are little reasons to consider them differently from other military units, they do take part in the fighting. But they are not really elite in any sense, naturally much more PR driven, and Kadyrov will want to preserve the Chechen cadre in any case. At least this is my impression, but I&#39;m not too knowledgeable about military units and their role in the war so it&#39;s mainly based on perception from more general articles on political games and may be completely off the mark; however the description given in that article is very far from general perception.</p>\n</div>",

They're also probably gone.\n\nI think the situation, supply-wise, is as bad as it is right now as it's ever going to be in the sector.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that artillery is located more than a few km from the front, it's not Pokrovsk that supplies Ukrainian artillery in shells. It's the front line units that would suffer from a lack of ammunition/supplies and quite evidently they already suffer from that.\n\n> The geography its a big gain too, the elevation gives adventage, and after this town the terrain it's too flat to make a good defence against Russian advences. \n\nIt's just as flat as the terrain North-East of Kherson and Russia is barely taking ground over there: https://en-ca.topographic-map.com/map-zq28tj/Tokmak/?center=47.82053%2C36.77124&zoom=8\n\nSure, it's probably a matter of how much resources they dedicate to destroy defences and defenders.

Of course, they could decide not to beeline and attack on a front that's 10x wider, and that's excellent news for defensive purposes.\n\nIn the end, even if they progress at the same pace they have in the last month, Russia won't be reaching Pavlohrad before at least another year.

But also their towed artillery reserves will be gone: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FozvYM2Zhpw\n\nUnless Russia secures massive vehicle and artillery (not just ammunition) support from other countries, it won't be executing large offensive operations like this for another year.",

Will delete if source is NCD. 25 min interview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVEpemEOXCE / text: https://theins.press/en/confession/274009\nWarning: He details some pretty brutal incidents (and the graphics are not exactly SWF), also summarized in this post.\n\nKey points I remember from watching yesterday:\n- He was mobilized and deserted after 6 months\n- From his unit of 250 men, only 2-3 privates + a dozen or so commanders, deputies & staff survived. The neigbhouring units lost ~1500 (each) in the same timespan\n- They were at the front, and the unit commander (\"an ex mall security guard that wanted to land on TV\") was getting them to attack from day 1. Initially 20 guys a day, in groups of 5, later partially groups of 2.

Than there's some more:\n- There is widespread abuse among frontline commanders (\"40%\") of some soviet painkiller that makes you high - hence all first aid kits arrive without them.\n- The military police does not appraoch the front as they are too scared\n- As a consequence, on the front, there is no way to deal with discipline issues (like refusing to attack across a field when there's a baba yaga currently hovering). Hence, frontline commanders take matters into their own hands. Typically: Summary execution after being taped to a tree next to a ditch. Or being shot at close range with an AK while wearing 2 sets of body armour (broken ribs at least). Or being shot in the helmet with a pistol point blank.

They found him and thought he was a mobilized from their unit who was running away (despite his ID stating otherwise), and were about to execute him when the other guy was found... The pit they were about to execute him into had 30 bodies.\n- There is widespread smuggling of weaponds out of the frontline into Russia, typically in bodybags. \"No one collects/counts the weapons from the fallen.\"\n- He is very worried about the future of Russia, where these cruel and dehumanized commanders & soldiers roam the streets with those weapons.",
