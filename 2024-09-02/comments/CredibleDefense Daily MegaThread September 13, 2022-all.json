But as spring progressed, e-commerce and business activity resumed in areas away from the front lines, and many factories switched to supplying the military. \u201cIt means we\u2019re profitable and even have some money for future investments,\u201d he said.\n\n>Ukraine\u2019s **economy, while hurting, is stabilizing** after the deep crash set off by the war, thanks to a combination of quick policy actions, military resilience and the flexible response of Ukrainian businesses to the damage and dislocation. **The uptick is boosting morale in the country along with recent combat breakthroughs in the east after months on the defensive**.\n\n>Early this year, as Russian forces threatened the capital Kyiv, it looked like Ukraine\u2019s economy might collapse, with **gross domestic product for the year projected to fall by as much as half. It is still expected to be down about 30%**, but summer saw a rebound from the depths of last spring.\n\n>\u201cThings are bad but stable,\u201d said Tymofiy Mylovanov, head of the Kyiv School of Economics. \u201cIt looks and feels like the economy is adapting.\u201d\n\n>A major factor is military: Russia\u2019s retreat from the area around Kyiv, the slow progress of its subsequent offensives and Ukraine\u2019s recent counterattacks have created enough certainty for economic activity to resume in the unoccupied part of Ukraine. The Ukrainian army\u2019s success in recent days in driving Russian forces out of the eastern Kharkiv region has shown how Ukraine has seized the strategic initiative and put Russia on the back foot, raising hopes that more territory will be liberated before winter and that Russia will struggle to resume the offensive.\n\n> \u201cIf you\u2019re 50 or 100 kilometers from the front line, there are missiles but you don\u2019t fear the Russians will be here tomorrow,\u201d said Mr. Mylovanov.\n\n> Ukraine\u2019s central bank and finance ministry also took swift steps, using a playbook drawn from earlier crises, that economists say helped to prevent a bigger disaster.\n\n>The National Bank of Ukraine imposed capital controls and pegged Ukraine\u2019s currency, the hryvnia, to the dollar at a level that didn\u2019t allow import costs and inflation to skyrocket. The bank had to **devalue the hryvnia in July when it came under too much pressure, but the new rate has held so far.**\n\n>The central bank, despite misgivings, printed money to keep the government solvent at a time when international markets wouldn\u2019t lend and tax revenues were evaporating. \u201cAt the beginning of the war we understood it is impossible to conduct our monetary policy as before,\u201d said Sergiy Nikolaychuk, deputy governor of the National Bank of Ukraine.\n\n>The government temporarily slashed business taxes and suspended sales taxes and import duties, providing a fiscal stimulus and easing imports of consumer goods during the darkest hour. Kyiv has gradually restored taxes as economic activity has stabilized.\n\n>**Russian efforts against vital systems such as banks and the internet have been largely ineffective, and they have continued to function.**\n\n>Russian bombs destroyed most of Igor Liski\u2019s wood-processing factory west of Kyiv this spring. He decided to rebuild it to set an example of resistance. It will be operating at nearly full capacity by fall, he said.\n\n>\u201cI believe victory will depend on the economy,\u201d said the 43-year-old entrepreneur. \u201cUkraine needs companies to give work, pay taxes, export products. All companies who can, should produce.\u201d\n\n>**Despite the recent gains, the economic blow has been severe. Russian troops have seized some of the heartlands of Ukrainian industry and agriculture; blockaded the Black Sea ports that Ukrainian exports rely on; and bombed factories, oil refineries and other infrastructure. Millions of Ukrainians have become refugees inside the country and across Europe, and unemployment is declining slowly from a peak of 35%**.\n\n>Russian missiles continue to strike, and winter will bring new difficulties, including the sky-high cost of heating and fears of natural-gas shortages. In recent days, Russian strikes against power stations, which have caused temporary outages in several cities, are a warning that Moscow will try to target Ukraine\u2019s electricity and heating infrastructure.\n\n>Ukraine\u2019s Western allies, especially the **European Union, are lagging in sending promised financing for the government\u2019s huge budget deficit**, leaving Kyiv dangerously reliant on money-printing by the central bank. That has contributed to inflation of over 20%.\n\n>\u201cIt\u2019s crucial for the resilience of Ukraine that we get the funding that was committed from our international partners,\u201d said Yuriy Vitrenko, CEO of the national oil-and-gas company Naftogaz.\n\n>But determination not to go under is evident across the country, and many Ukrainian businesses are finding workarounds for missile threats, blocked logistics, shortages and scattered workforces. \u201cMotivation and truth are on our side,\u201d said Mr. Liski. \u201cIf we survive also on the economic side, definitely we will win the war.\u201d\n\n>Mr. Liski built his first businesses in Luhansk in eastern Ukraine. He lost them all in Russia\u2019s covert invasion of the region in 2014. He moved to Kyiv and built up new ventures in industry and agriculture, ranging from wood-processing to honey-making. His company, a private-equity fund called Effective Investments Group, uses foreign capital raised from Europe and North America.\n\n>He is pitching a proposal to the government for an insurance fund involving international insurers that protects investments against military risk to spur rebuilding now despite the continuing war.\n\n>Ukraine\u2019s economy suffered a deep depression in the 1990s after the collapse of Communism. Later, a series of shocks set the country back, from the 2008 global financial crisis to Russia\u2019s 2014 seizure of Crimea and part of Ukraine\u2019s east. **Ukrainians watched while neighbors such as Poland and Romania joined the EU and grew rapidly. Ukraine\u2019s aspirations for deeper economic ties with the West, and Moscow\u2019s resistance, were among the causes of the conflict**.\n\n>Ukraine\u2019s economy was improving before Russia\u2019s invasion this year. **Many Ukrainians say the latest economic shock is still better than the one in the 1990s, when employers couldn\u2019t pay wages and mass hardship swept the country. Many also say past experience has engendered a mentality of inventive self-reliance**.",

            "body": ">\u201cWe are well trained in recovering from all types of crises,\u201d said Mariya Masliy, a shoe designer from Kyiv. \u201cCrisis management is the norm since we were born.\u201d\n\n>Ms. Masliy has switched from designing high heels to army boots with Kevlar protection. The factory she works with in Kharkiv was bombed; it has restarted production in safer western Ukraine. Currently a refugee in Amsterdam, she has carved out a new Dutch export market for her fashion brand, Marsala. \u201cA Dutch friend told me \u2018You Ukrainians are all so active, you don\u2019t sit around in depression,\u2019 \u201d she said.\n\n>The invasion threatened to cut off Ukraine\u2019s access to gasoline, diesel and crude oil, which came overland from Russia and from Belarus, a Russian ally, or from the blockaded Black Sea. Russian missiles also destroyed Ukraine\u2019s main oil refineries and major fuel depots. Executives from Ukraine\u2019s gas-station operators, led by major networks OKKO and WOG, traveled frantically around the EU, buying up new supplies of gasoline and diesel. They had to pay cash up front, sometimes a month in advance, to European suppliers that didn\u2019t like the risk of dealing with a country being invaded.\n\n>Importing fuel by train was difficult, because Ukrainian railroads have a wider gauge than the EU\u2019s. At the Polish-Ukrainian border, fuel had to be siphoned out of EU-standard trains and pumped into Ukrainian wagons. \u201cIt isn\u2019t easy or quick,\u201d said Vasyl Danylyak, chief executive of OKKO.\n\n>**In April, Ukraine imported only about 200,000 metric tons of fuel, compared with a million tons a month before the war. Mile-long lines of cars were a common sight at Ukrainian gas stations**. The government relaxed fuel-price controls to help importers cover higher logistics costs. Gas-station networks bought fuel from all over the world, except Russia, bringing it in by road, rail and river. By July, imports were back up to 770,000 tons. It was enough to meet demand, and **lines at gas stations disappeared**.\n\n>The fuel companies operate without large depots because of missile attacks. **WOG keeps less than $3 million of gasoline in any one place, to keep the target\u2019s value below the cost of Russian missiles**.\n\n>A deal brokered by Turkey to reopen the Black Sea for limited grain exports is giving partial relief to Ukrainian agriculture and world food markets\u2014although **Russia has threatened to curtail the shipments**. But heavy industry is still struggling without sea access.\n\n>Ukraine\u2019s biggest steel plant, the ArcelorMittal steel mill in Kryviy Rih, is producing at about 20% of its prewar volume. The mill has switched to sending steel westward to the EU via road and rail. But without ports, **it can\u2019t import enough coking coal to Kryviy Rih, limiting how much iron ore it can process**. \u201cYou solve one bottleneck and you find another,\u201d said Mauro Longobardo, an Italian who heads the Ukraine operations of the Luxembourg-based multinational. Low volume and expensive logistics mean the plant is losing money. It has cut wages and will need to cut jobs if the situation doesn\u2019t improve. \u201cIf we reduce people, this city hurts like hell,\u201d he said.\n\n>The gritty steel town of Kryviy Rih, about 40 miles from the front-line fighting in south Ukraine, holds symbolic importance for both sides: It is the hometown of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The steel mill helped defend it early in the invasion when a Russian armored column came within less than 10 miles by giving the Ukrainian army several giant mining trucks to block the road into town. **The Russian armored vehicles couldn\u2019t use the soggy ground around the obstacle, came under fire and retreated, a strategic setback for Russia\u2019s campaign in the south**.\n\n\n>Service sectors are faring better, despite challenges. Nova Poshta, the parcel-delivery company, struggled through the springtime gasoline shortages. **In Kharkiv, Russian shelling killed people queuing at a branch for humanitarian packages**. Sorting centers in Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Mykolaiv were also bombed.\n\n>**\u201cWe began rebuilding the sorting centers within hours. Now you can\u2019t see the damage,\u201d** said Mr. Klimov. Out of 30,000 prewar employees, about 2,700 have joined the military. The company laid off about 1,500 people, mainly in Russian-held areas where it can\u2019t operate.\n\n>Signs of recovery in Ukraine\u2019s job market began soon after Russian forces retreated from Kyiv. **Vacancies on Work.ua, Ukraine\u2019s biggest employment website, reached more than 40,000 on a given day in August, compared with only 6,000 in March. That compares with more than 100,000 vacancies in February**, before the invasion.\n\n>Vacancies show the geographical shift taking place in Ukraine\u2019s economy, said Artur Mikhno, Work.ua\u2019s CEO. Jobs are being created disproportionately in Lviv and other cities in Ukraine\u2019s safer west, and he said far fewer employers are hiring in eastern cities such as Kharkiv, which Russia continues to target from afar.\n\n>Work.ua is part of the burgeoning tech scene in Dnipro, an industrial city in central Ukraine. Other IT clusters have emerged in Kyiv and Lviv. Exports of IT services were up 23% in the first half of 2022 compared with a year earlier.\n\n>**\u201cWe\u2019re at war with a country with nuclear weapons and companies are still able to grow their business,\u201d said Alexander Kholodov, founder of Dnipro-based software company Yalantis.**\n\n>Many people are supporting the national defense and economy however they can.\n\n>Before the war, Petro Hryhoriev\u2019s main business was an 84-acre asparagus farm in the southern Kherson region. Russian troops now occupy it. Some of Mr. Hryhoriev\u2019s workers are now refugees in Europe, and others are in Kherson but uncontactable. He is still wiring them their salaries, using the farm\u2019s financial reserves and the profits from two cafes he opened this year in Dnipro. He has donated body armor, helmets, medicine and two cars to the army. He said he firmly believes Kherson will be liberated and he will see his farm again.\n\n>**On a summer evening in Dnipro, Mr. Hryhoriev\u2019s cafes were lively, and young people drank and talked on the waterfront until the midnight wartime curfew**. The city of over a million on the banks of the wide Dnipro river has suffered less bombing than cities nearer the front line and has become a haven for many displaced people.\n\n>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to live a full life,\u201d Mr. Hryhoriev said. \u201cEveryone wants their life back.\u201d\n\n>Among the Soviet-era high-rise blocks of eastern Kyiv, Maksym Pustakov is starting to rebuild the food-kiosk business he lost in Mariupol, the port city destroyed in one of the most brutal episodes of Russia\u2019s invasion.\n\n>After fleeing Mariupol with his wife and son and reaching Kyiv, Mr. Pustakov said he shut his eyes and tapped on his mobile phone\u2019s banking app. Opening his eyes, he was relieved to see his bank was still working and his money was all there. He decided to open up a new shawarma kiosk in Troieshchyna, a tough working-class suburb of the capital. All their employees are fellow refugees from Mariupol. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to wait for something to happen. We are not that sort of people. We decided to act,\u201d he said. The outlet took off, and Mr. Pustakov is already expanding it and planning a second. His ambition, he said, is to build a chain across Ukraine.",
            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>\u201cWe are well trained in recovering from all types of crises,\u201d said Mariya Masliy, a shoe designer from Kyiv. \u201cCrisis management is the norm since we were born.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Ms. Masliy has switched from designing high heels to army boots with Kevlar protection. The factory she works with in Kharkiv was bombed; it has restarted production in safer western Ukraine. Currently a refugee in Amsterdam, she has carved out a new Dutch export market for her fashion brand, Marsala. \u201cA Dutch friend told me \u2018You Ukrainians are all so active, you don\u2019t sit around in depression,\u2019 \u201d she said.</p>\n\n<p>The invasion threatened to cut off Ukraine\u2019s access to gasoline, diesel and crude oil, which came overland from Russia and from Belarus, a Russian ally, or from the blockaded Black Sea. Russian missiles also destroyed Ukraine\u2019s main oil refineries and major fuel depots. Executives from Ukraine\u2019s gas-station operators, led by major networks OKKO and WOG, traveled frantically around the EU, buying up new supplies of gasoline and diesel. They had to pay cash up front, sometimes a month in advance, to European suppliers that didn\u2019t like the risk of dealing with a country being invaded.</p>\n\n<p>Importing fuel by train was difficult, because Ukrainian railroads have a wider gauge than the EU\u2019s. At the Polish-Ukrainian border, fuel had to be siphoned out of EU-standard trains and pumped into Ukrainian wagons. \u201cIt isn\u2019t easy or quick,\u201d said Vasyl Danylyak, chief executive of OKKO.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In April, Ukraine imported only about 200,000 metric tons of fuel, compared with a million tons a month before the war. Mile-long lines of cars were a common sight at Ukrainian gas stations</strong>. The government relaxed fuel-price controls to help importers cover higher logistics costs. Gas-station networks bought fuel from all over the world, except Russia, bringing it in by road, rail and river. By July, imports were back up to 770,000 tons.

Analysts believe that, for example, **one Russian tank division may have lost half its combat power.**  \n\n>According to the Ukrainian military's General Staff, **during the week beginning Sept. 6, 590 pieces of Russian equipment were destroyed**. \n\n>>\"Enemy losses were 86 tanks and 158 armored fighting vehicles, 106 artillery systems, 159 vehicles and 46 units of other equipment,\" the General Staff claimed.\n\n>CNN cannot independently verify the figures cited, but an independent group, Oryx \u2014 which has collated Russian losses since the campaign began \u2014 said it has verified a surge of losses among Russian units compared to August. Most have been incurred in Kharkiv, though the Russians have also lost equipment in Kherson and Donetsk. \n\n>In one day alone, Sept. 11, Oryx estimated that Ukrainian forces destroyed, damaged or captured 102 pieces of Russian equipment, including 23 tanks, 13 armored personnel carriers and 25 infantry fighting vehicles. The following day, the Russians lost a further 99 pieces, according to Oryx data. \n\n>As it only counts observed and verifiable losses in its data, Oryx says the real rate of losses is likely much higher. \n\n>**According to rolling averages compiled by Oryx, in the second week of September, Russian forces were losing an average of more than 60 pieces of equipment a day, compared to about 15 a day in the final week of August. That's the highest sustained rate of loss since several disastrous attempts to cross the Siverskyi Donets river in May**.\n\n>**In the same period, Ukrainian verified losses were running at about 10 pieces of equipment**. \n\n>Some of the **equipment appears to have belonged to the Luhansk People's Militia** rather than regular Russian forces and is likely to have been older. But substantial amounts of modern hardware were also lost.\n\n>Geolocated images show a number of updated T-80 tanks were among those damaged or destroyed, as well as mine-clearing vehicles and armored personnel carriers.\n\n>Military analyst Rob Lee of the Department of War Studies at King's College London tweeted Monday that videos showed T-80s, armored personnel carriers and other vehicles all disabled. Lee later tweeted: **\"Russia's 4th Tank Division has two tank regiments ... With the most recent losses in Izium, it has lost nearly a full regiment of T-80U variant tanks in Ukraine, or half its total that weren't in storage.\"**\n\n>Ukraine Weapons Tracker, which also analyzes social media and official images, said that in one single location near Izium, \"we counted no less than nine T-80U and T-80BV tanks.\"\n\n>Some more specialized equipment was also lost, including a Zoopark-1 radar station, which tracks the positions of enemy firepower. Other videos show Ukrainian soldiers showing off captured Russian Tor and Osa short-range surface-to-air missile systems in the Kharkiv region. There are also images of Russian Orlan-10 drones retrieved by Ukrainian forces, apparently undamaged.\n\n>Some analysts believe Russian forces left equipment behind because of a lack of fuel. \n\n>According to the Institute for the Study of War: \n\n>>\"Russian troops likely withdrew from the area in great haste, and social media posts show abandoned tanks and other heavy military equipment near Izium, which indicates that Russian troops failed to organize a coherent retreat.\"\n\n>The loss of so much armor and other equipment may also complicate the Russians' task of reconstituting units and forming a new defensive line inside the Luhansk region.",

And they could start preparing to take the Donbass back from a strong position much sooner.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe not immediately, but certainly sooner than on a timeline where they spend another 2 months beating it out at the frontlines drawn on the map right now.</p>\n\n<p>Presently, we&#39;ll have to see if Ukraine currently has such an opportunity. I&#39;m skeptical that they do, or at least don&#39;t want to jump to the assumption that they do...but...this conflict has produced surprises multiple times so far.</p>\n</div>",

In the book, the American quartermaster gradually becomes a kingpin at the center of a vast organization due to his ability to grease the cogs. He even ends up making good connections with the Germans, who make a contract with him to bomb his own base in exchange for a large sum of cash. The quartermaster accepts, then pays a bomber squadron to bomb their own base. When his superiors understandably come for his head, he explains how the money he received more than covers the damage to the base, as well as providing a nice profit for the US army to buy more supplies (he is still a reliable quartermaster). And of course, a tidy profit for himself and his boys.\n\n\nCatch 22 is fantastic. I can highly recommend it as pretty relevant to the modern day.",

We will intensify our strikes and liberate new territories in a different way,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Becky Anderson in an interview.\n\n>Lyman, an important rail hub, is roughly 37 miles (60 kilometers) west of the strategically important Ukrainian city of Severodonetsk.\n\n>President Volodymyr Zelensky says Ukrainian forces have taken 6,000 square kilometers of land since the beginning of the month. His adviser also said they conducted a storm operation that liberated \u201cmore than 300 settlements in four days.\u201d\n\n>**\u201cWe prepared carefully for this. It has taken months of planning. We used reconnaissance and accuracy, we used our allies, especially the United States army, for information on this, and we used Western weapons,\u201d** Zelensky added.\n\n>During the recent offensive, Ukrainian forces managed to capture Russian weaponry that would support around three brigades in their fighting, Arestovych told CNN. He also said Russia suffered \u201chuge casualties\u201d and lost some soldiers who Ukraine had captured as prisoners of war. **Asked by CNN whether they will be afforded the rights they are entitled to under the Geneva convention, he said \u201cabsolutely.\u201d**\n\n>\u201cWe are a European army and a European country, we follow international law. We do not break the Geneva Convention or other international conventions about the rules of war\u2026 We give them rights and the possibility to call home, their mothers, and fathers\u2026and to speak with journalists if they want,\u201d Arestovych continued. \nArestovych said Ukrainian forces used disinformation to trick Russian soldiers on the battlefield by making them think they were going to strike at Kherson.\n\n>\u201cThey thought we were going to start the main strike on the city of Kherson. We did start our strike on Kherson, but it was an assisted strike, not the main strike. The main strike we provided in the east of our country, and the Russians were completely surprised about this, because two months before, we were only speaking about the Kherson region. That\u2019s why we liberated territory in four days that Russians tried to keep for about four months.\u201d he said.\n\n> **[Ukrainian official warns about abandoned ammo and Russian soldiers still at-large in Kharkiv region](https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-09-13-22/h_bfecff212c361514c7b8ec80fc0d6d40)**\n\n> A Ukrainian official said that despite the retreat of Russian forces from much of the Kharkiv region, the area remains dangerous \u2014 with some Russian soldiers \"wandering in the forests\" and huge amounts of abandoned ammunition yet to be secured.\n\n>Stepan Maselskyi, head of the Izium district military-civilian administration, told CNN Tuesday that there is no power, electricity and water in most settlements.\n\n>There are also \"major problems with gas in most of the communities, very serious damage to gas pipelines. There is no provision of medical services. Medical services were not provided during the occupation,\" he said.\n\n>Maselskyi told CNN by phone that there is a \"very big danger [with munitions left behind]. A lot of \u2018booby traps,\u2019 a lot of explosive items left, scattered.\"\n\n>He said that near Balakliya, which was re-taken last week, one person was killed by a mine on Tuesday. \"Many sappers work in the area, but the [liberated] territory is very large. It takes time to de-mine everything and defuse all explosive objects,\" he said.\n\n>There are \"a lot of places where ammunition was left, abandoned,\" he added.\n\n>**According to Maselskyi, \"Some [Russian soldiers] are still wandering in the forests of the Izium region**. ... All measures are now being taken to detain them.\"\n\n>He referred further comment to the military.\n\n>\"The occupiers looted everything they could,\" Maselskyi told CNN. \"From households of people who had evacuated, everything was taken away. We try to prevent looting by locals. We immediately take the liberated settlements under the protection of the National Police.\"\n\n> Maselskyi said it would be a while before residents could return home.\n\n>\"It is dangerous now, until the territory is de-mined and the shells are dismantled. Until we are completely sure that the territory is clear of mines, tripwires and that the occasional occupiers are not hiding anywhere \u2014 only then will special bodies allow entry,\" he said.\n\n>Maselskyi said restoring electricity and water is a top priority. \"We have a week of hard 24/7 work ahead.

So many possibilities.\n\nDepends what the Russians do, right? Right now it looks questionable whether the Russian army is capable of successfully defending on two fronts simultaneously. Reports that they sent tons of men/equipment to Kherson to defend against the counterattack there, which made some progress anyway, and that lead to the breakthrough in Kharkiv. Now rumors they are shifting those same forces back towards Kharkiv, they might not even have ever reached Kherson. If those troops reach Lyman and stiffen the line, great, can they hold Kherson without them? If they don't reach Lyman and stiffen the line, then Lyman probably falls. Etc. The comic reductio ad absurdum if this were a Good Soldier Svejk bit would be that Ukraine has the troop/equipment strength to just keep putting pressure in different spots, and that same unit of reserves runs back and forth but never gets anywhere in time to do anything.\n\nSo the question is can the Russians stop Ukr on two fronts at once?

Or are such claims 4D chess and they&#39;re actually going for Melitopol? So many possibilities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Depends what the Russians do, right? Right now it looks questionable whether the Russian army is capable of successfully defending on two fronts simultaneously. Reports that they sent tons of men/equipment to Kherson to defend against the counterattack there, which made some progress anyway, and that lead to the breakthrough in Kharkiv. Now rumors they are shifting those same forces back towards Kharkiv, they might not even have ever reached Kherson. If those troops reach Lyman and stiffen the line, great, can they hold Kherson without them? If they don&#39;t reach Lyman and stiffen the line, then Lyman probably falls. Etc. The comic reductio ad absurdum if this were a Good Soldier Svejk bit would be that Ukraine has the troop/equipment strength to just keep putting pressure in different spots, and that same unit of reserves runs back and forth but never gets anywhere in time to do anything.</p>\n\n<p>So the question is can the Russians stop Ukr on two fronts at once? If not, then the breakthrough will be in whichever direction is available at the time.</p>\n</div>",

That's fundamentally unsatisfying to the war-watcher community, compared to spectacular advances that you can depict on a map, like up north. Kherson is gonna be a grinding affair, not particularly suited to media narratives on either side. We can't see full casualty lists, but we can see pictures of units in towns and paint a map.

An air burst is an explosion in which a weapon is detonated in air at an altitude below 30 km but at sufficient height that the fireball does not contact the surface of the earth. After such a burst, blast may cause considerable damage and injury. The altitude of an air burst can be varied to obtain maximum blast effects, maximum thermal effects, desired radiation effects, or a balanced combination of these effects. Burns to exposed skin may be produced over many square kilometers and eye injuries over a still larger area. Initial nuclear radiation will be a significant hazard with smaller weapons, but the fallout hazard can be ignored as there is essentially no local fallout from an air burst. The fission products are generally dispersed over a large area of the globe unless there is local rainfall resulting in localized fallout. In the vicinity of ground zero, there may be a small area of neutron-induced activity which could be hazardous to troops required to pass through the area. Tactically, air bursts are the most likely to be used against ground forces",

I don't believe they did. The issue with that was the Kharkiv area was only a good location in the first place because it was a major Russian weakpoint. But it wasn't a weak point until AFTER Russians started moving large numbers of units out of the Izyum axis to Kherson, which didn't start until late July and into August. \n\nSo what's more likely is they planned the Kherson counteroffensive first, back in July, but that ended up drawing Russian reinforcements instead of causing a retreat (which was highly probable considering the bridges were being attacked since 7/19). They throttled back on the tempo and goals for Kherson but then authorized OC-E to use available assets already on hand to exploit the weakness the Russians created to reinforce Kherson. Interrelated but not joint operations planned together. \n\nLastly, why would the UA GenStab need the Pentagon to war game the probability of success for an attack by five armored brigades against a handful of strung out Russian battalions, many of which were paramilitary and not even meant to be holding a defensive line? They needed computerized numbers crunching to tell them that would be successful? Seriously?",

There are people here who understand modern tactical warfare much better, but an additional perspective:\n\nSince ancient times, the most important aspect of a battle has been the geographic and natural features/composition of the battlefield. The best generals of antiquity would happily give away almost every other advantage, whether it be manpower, armor, element of surprise, weapons -- to fight the battle on grounds that were advantageous to them. In Kherson, the battlefield isn't conducive to rapid offensives unless the Ukrainians have an overwhelming advantage in armor and counterbattery, which they don't. We're talking about really flat land with just agricultural fields as far as the eye can see. Little tree cover and next to no human settlements -- thus not many places to hide. That means, ultimately, that the Russian's advantage in drone and artillery warfare is amplified. And because the Ukrainians don't have the armor and ability to hit back at Russian artillery, they have to do everything to turn Russia's biggest advantage into their biggest weakness. \n\nHow do they do that? Well, artillery is ammunition hungry. So, you hit every ammo dump you possibly can to starve the Russian guns. With each ammo dump removed, the Russians are going to adjust to a more decentralized approach to logistics, but they simply do not have the heavy equipment required to feed their ammo hungry artillery at the same rate. But accomplishing that goal takes time. You have to identify the big ammo dumps, then hit them. Then, when the Russians decentralize, you have to find the smaller dumps, hit them, and so on. Second, you remove the Russians ability to supply those dumps in the first place. That's what the attacks on the bridges, ferries, pontoon crossings, etc. have been trying to achieve. Once again, given the weapons at the Ukrainian's disposal, that process is going to take time. And that's what we're seeing. As an example, the Antonivskyi Bridge is still standing, and perhaps still useable. \n\nKharkiv, on the other hand, would have worked in almost exactly the opposite way. The fighting there took place around villages with enough urban dwellings, natural forests that provide cover and just sufficient undulation in the land to make a fast offensive possible. The element of surprise also worked massively in the Ukrainians favor. Not only in the initial attack, but the subsequent 3-4 days as well. You don't know where the enemy is, where they are going to attack from, and how many troops they have **precisely** because of the difference in geography. Ultimately, the biggest factor in Kharkiv was that there simply wasn't enough Russian manpower to hold territory that vast, so the faster the Ukrainians went, the better their results would have been.

They massed units and resources in Kherson and Kharkiv-Donbas to conduct large scale offensive operations, but likely couldn't do similar in Zaporizhzhia. Finding the units for the recent Kharkiv counteroffensive was easy, they were already in those areas for months fighting somewhere on the front lines or in the local reserve, they only needed to move those brigades to a select area to mass them before attacking. But there are no large numbers of similar units (and supplies) on the line in Zaporizhzhia, so they would need to be moved from another front, and that takes time.\n\n- Planning takes time too. The Kharkiv counteroffensive was likely thought up since early to mid August after the Russians weakened the Izyum axis to send units to reinforce Kherson. Pro-Russian OSINT posters like Rybar were openly reporting on a UAF build up in that exact area as far back as August 31st, a full week before they attacked.\n\n- Expectation of success. While they likely knew they'd be successful in Kharkiv there is no way in hell they anticipated the Russians to totally collapse. Nobody ever plans for the crazy best case scenario since it's very unlikely to occur. Had the offensive gone well but not as smashingly successful as it did, momentum would not be so high, morale would not be so high, and we'd not be wondering where the next massive victory would occur.\n\n- Patience. Maybe they are planning something? But since they'd not have known the success of Kharkiv till at least September 8, and because it will take at least a week to move additional units and supplies from Donbas-Kharkiv to Zaporizhzhia, and to actually plan out an attack, something could be in the works right now that might start in a few days.",

Good analysis of that here:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHhgVrKJJoA&amp;t=12s\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHhgVrKJJoA&amp;t=12s</a></p>\n\n<p>And it is also well accepted that the Russians are struggling to build new gear, especially at a rate fast enough to replace what is getting destroyed or donated to the Ukrainians.</p>\n\n<p>A least the gear from the states has been maintained and is often much better equipment than the equivalent Russian stuff.</p>\n</div>",
