It's fairly candid. Some excerpts:\n\n>I trust my generals. Since the start of the war I fired ten of them because they were not up to it. Another one shot himself. I trust Syrsky [General Oleksandr Syrsky, commander of Ukraine\u2019s land forces]. If he tells me he needs another brigade, it means that he really needs another brigade. I certainly don\u2019t think I am the smartest one here. I must and do listen to those who are in the field. Because the initiative is there.\n\n>[\u2026]\n\n>They wanted to take Kyiv. Militarily this was the right decision\u2014the easiest way to achieve their goal. I would have done the same. I know Gerasimov [the head of Russia\u2019s armed forces] well (not personally, of course). There was no way out for him. He concentrated on Donbas to preserve whatever resources he had left.\n\nZaluzhny's respect for Gerasimov was previously attested to in [his interview](https://time.com/6216213/ukraine-military-valeriy-zaluzhny/) with *Time*, calling him \"the smartest of men\".\n\n>We have made all the calculations\u2014how many tanks, artillery we need and so on and so on. This is what everyone needs to concentrate on right now. May the soldiers in the trenches forgive me, it\u2019s more important to focus on the accumulation of resources right now for the more protracted and heavier battles that may begin next year. I\u2019ll be talking to Milley [America\u2019s top soldier] about this [later today].\n\n>I will tell him how much it is worth, how much it costs. If we don\u2019t get it, of course we will fight to the end.\n\nIs it worrying that Milley is his liason for aid given that Milley was loudly pushing for negotiations?\n\n>TE: Do you need to conduct another wave of mobilisation?\n\n>VZ: We are already conducting it as it is. We have enough people, and I can clearly see what I have. I have enough. I don\u2019t need hundreds of thousands more.\n\n>We need tanks, we need APCs [armoured personnel carriers], infantry fighting vehicles. And we need ammunition. Please note, I\u2019m not talking about F-16s right now.\n\nInteresting that manpower does not seem to be an issue. Also, why does he go out of his way to reject F-16s?\n\n>TE: Can we talk about air defence?\n\n>VZ: Now we have a ratio of 0.76. Russians are using this 0.76 coefficient of efficacy when they plan their attacks. This means that instead of 76 missiles, they launch 100. And 24 get through and reach their target. And what do two missiles do to a power station? It won\u2019t work for two years. So it has to be built up.\n\n>[\u2026]\n\n>When they say, \u201cYou get 50,000 shells\u201d, the people who count the money faint. The biggest problem is that they really don\u2019t have it.\n\n>With this kind of resources I can\u2019t conduct new big operations, even though we are working on one right now. It is on the way, but you don\u2019t see it yet. We use a lot fewer shells.\n\n>I know that I can beat this enemy. But I need resources. **I need 300 tanks, 600-700 IFVs, 500 Howitzers. Then, I think it is completely realistic to get to the lines of February 23rd.** But I can\u2019t do it with two brigades. I get what I get, but it is less than what I need.\n\n>[\u2026]\n\n>Russian mobilisation has worked. It is not true that their problems are so dire that these people will not fight. They will. A tsar tells them to go to war, and they go to war. I\u2019ve studied the history of the two Chechen wars\u2014it was the same. They may not be that well equipped, but they still present a problem for us. We estimate that they have a reserve of 1.2m-1.5m people\u2026 **The Russians are preparing some 200,000 fresh troops. I have no doubt they will have another go at Kyiv.**\n\nThey all seem pretty certain that another Russian offensive is coming, and that there will be another attempt at Kyiv. I wonder if this reflects actual intelligence or is a strategy to expedite military aid.",

To my mind, this is a total lack of imagination and paralysis of leadership.\n\nWe just spent two decades where the military budget and logistic constraints went completely unnoticed.

We are now in a position where for an absolutely maddeningly small fraction of the same domestic expenditure, with absolutely zero risk of shedding American blood, we could do something fundamentally right and good, a geopolitical and domestic slam dunk, and instead we drag our feet at every turn.\n\nThe Ukrainians have not criticized us in the US at all like they have been willing to do to the Germans, because they are wise enough to see that they cannot risk our support, but I think quite frankly it is an outrage how little we have sent in proportion to what we can. The truest argument against it all is also the most cowardly, we are afraid that doing more risks nuclear war. What that amounts to is we say we are willing to trade any amount of Ukrainian lives for a slim extra assurance that sending Javelins but not Abrams is what will make the difference to Russia in not using nukes. This craven logic is also faulty. If Russia wanted to end the world with nukes, then it makes exactly zero difference if our support is full throated or not, it is entirely a question of how zealously suicidal they are and really nothing more.",

We are now in a position where for an absolutely maddeningly small fraction of the same domestic expenditure, with absolutely zero risk of shedding American blood, we could do something fundamentally right and good, a geopolitical and domestic slam dunk, and instead we drag our feet at every turn.</p>\n\n<p>The Ukrainians have not criticized us in the US at all like they have been willing to do to the Germans, because they are wise enough to see that they cannot risk our support, but I think quite frankly it is an outrage how little we have sent in proportion to what we can. The truest argument against it all is also the most cowardly, we are afraid that doing more risks nuclear war. What that amounts to is we say we are willing to trade any amount of Ukrainian lives for a slim extra assurance that sending Javelins but not Abrams is what will make the difference to Russia in not using nukes. This craven logic is also faulty. If Russia wanted to end the world with nukes, then it makes exactly zero difference if our support is full throated or not, it is entirely a question of how zealously suicidal they are and really nothing more.</p>\n</div>",

Not without willfully stripping a significant percentage of present NATO active and reserve inventories, especially the US who is the only one with the numbers that would make such fanciful numbers possible. \n\nIn terms of Zaluzhnyi's wish list, they equate to roughly 30 tank companies, 45 mech infantry companies, and 83 batteries of artillery. At 3x of each to build a battalion, that's 10 tank, 15 mech infantry, and 27 artillery battalions, so enough for a whole bunch more heavy maneuver and separate artillery brigades. A significant increase in the size of Ukrainian Ground Forces, essentially building an offensive focused heavy corps \"armored fist,\" stronger than anything they currently possess.\n\nTo put those figures in comparison, the active duty US Army has 60 tank companies, 60 mech infantry companies, and 93 artillery batteries. And of all the artillery the West has already given to Ukraine, that only amounts to roughly 58 batteries.\n\nAbout political will, to get that equipment to Ukraine anytime soon will mean raiding the US Army's prepositioned stocks around the world, which are intended to specifically equip armored brigades in troublesome areas, or using maritime floating stocks, so in case of an emergency they don't need to actually load up and ship a CONUS based armored BCT with vehicles (taking at least a month) but instead just fly out the personnel. Right now there are no permanent stationed ABCTs overseas, only infantry or Stryker brigades, with ABCTs rotating on deployments while using APS vehicles. So 2-3 ABCTs would need to be permanently stationed overseas (leading to readiness issues and very high costs) in order to give the prepositioned stocks to Ukraine. Either that or take them from the Army National Guard, which will involve basically going to war with a whole bunch of governors who will fight it tooth and nail.\n\nAnd that doesn't remotely consider the enabler equipment, spare parts, contractor support that basically moves permanently to Poland (even active Army can't fully maintain its own equipment alone), and all the training that the UAF will insist can be done in 3-4 weeks, because highly motivated Ukrainians are proven to learn at a higher rate than anyone else in recorded history.\n\nI don't even bring up European nations because realistically none have the stockpiles to give more than a token amount of random vehicles that won't be standardized and will only complicate the logistics systems, which isn't what Ukraine wants. \n\nNot that any of this will happen, these are fairy tale \"shoot for the sun\" numbers, and no nation state leaders in the West have the willpower because it means turning traitor to their own country's security in exchange for placating the Twitter mob because of a magazine article.\n\nBut this is how the game is played as anyone who has negotiated knows (or gotten sued or sued someone else). Start with a ridiculously large figure that will never happen and then \"accept\" a lower amount that was what you thought was realistic in the first place. \n\nBy putting these numbers out to American media, this is how Ukraine is forced to negotiate. They don't have legit political power but they do have lots of popularity, so they use that to their advantage as leverage. The fact that Zaluzhnyi mentions an objective to reach Feb 23 borders shows this message is purely intended only for western readers, as that hasn't been Ukraine policy since mid summer, but it's floated as an ideal by many in the West. In other words, \"we need this equipment to reach the territorial lines that you guys want in order to cram a peace deal down our throats.\" It's a good selling point.\n\nI got to hand it to them, the Ukrainians are really really really good at Information Operations.",

They fall behind when it comes to precision and finesse, but they are still the sledgehammer they have always been, more so that now they have a large mass of warm bodies to back any assault. Their organization and approach of course lack lower level initiative, but the tradeoff is this means wielding huge bodies of untrained soldiers is easier, as less is demanded of them, so long as the larger organization is finding the right offensive outlet.\n\nThe smart move, from a Russian perspective, is to not get bogged down in defensive fighting, where Ukraine can pivot their high precision pinpricks around repeatedly, it is to keep the huge Russian army's mass in motion and maintain initiative from the top, the only place Russia's organization allows it. Retreating to the border up North has allowed Russia to maintain a degree of temporary force ambiguity, because they know Ukraine will never cross and invade it, but must maintain a larger presence there nonetheless to protect against Russia. Over time though, this benefit will fade if Russia doesn't make serious moves, because all the uncontested border frontlines from Kharkiv to Lviv will be getting strengthened with entrenchment measures, and require fewer and fewer reserves to watch them. Unbalancing them with a surprise reopening of the front before this is complete makes sense, and will prevent Ukraine from ever massing the forces necessary elsewhere on the newly shortened front. Previously, shortening the front by retreating from Kherson made sense for Russia, because Kherson was an extremely difficult to defend and supply salient. Now, Russia has more forces and would likely benefit from the widening of the front, this time though from places more favorable to them.",

        "body": "Fascinating piece in the FT today about how the Kremlin's technocrats have responded to the war.\n\n>**How Putin\u2019s technocrats saved the economy to fight a war they opposed**\n\n>One month before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Vladimir Putin\u2019s top economic confidants visited the Russian president\u2019s residence at Novo-Ogaryovo outside Moscow to brief him on the likely fallout from western sanctions.\n\n>Putin listened as Herman Gref, chief executive of state-owned lender Sberbank, led a 39-page presentation warning the Russian president of disastrous consequences if tensions over Ukraine, then already at fever pitch, were to escalate further still.\n\n>A close ally of Putin\u2019s since their days in the St Petersburg mayor\u2019s office in the 1990s, Gref had a reputation for being the most liberal member of Putin\u2019s extended circle \u2014 and for speaking his mind.\n\n>At that moment, the technocrats feared Putin was on the verge of recognising two Kremlin proxy separatist statelets in Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region, which they believed would provoke a furious western reaction that could cripple Russia\u2019s economy.\n\n>Elvira Nabiullina, the highly respected central bank governor, and the other attendees shared his concerns and had helped prepare the presentation. But they let Gref take the floor.\n\n>The presentation warned Putin that \u201charsh sanctions\u201d would create panic on financial markets and potentially set Russia\u2019s economy back decades.\n\n>Gross domestic product could fall by 30 per cent in dollar terms in two years. Inflation would force the central bank to raise interest rates to 35 per cent, cutting real incomes by a fifth.\n\n>Russians\u2019 quality of life would lag behind even developing countries as restrictions on imports would make Russia struggle not only to find advanced technologies, but essentials such as medicines and food.\n\n>As Gref rattled through the potential consequences, Putin cut him off and asked him what Russia should do to avoid the worst of the sanctions, according to several people familiar with the matter.\n\n>Too timid to warn Putin off military escalation, the technocrats had no clear solution \u2014 and could not bring themselves to tell Putin he was at risk of courting geopolitical disaster.\n\n>They left the meeting none the wiser about what exactly Putin was planning or whether he had taken their message onboard, the people say.\n\n>\u201cThey were brave enough to ask the big man for a meeting. But they could not deliver the message,\u201d says one of the people. \u201cThey were unable to deliver the only answer.\u201d\n\n>The full-scale assault on Ukraine on February 24, three days after Putin recognised the Donbas separatists, exceeded their worst fears. They discovered Putin\u2019s true intentions along with the rest of the world: on television.\n\n>Putin\u2019s failure to heed the technocrats\u2019 warnings devastated them. \u201cI\u2019d never seen [Gref] like that. He was completely bereft, in a state of total shock,\u201d says a former executive who saw Gref in the war\u2019s early days. \u201cEveryone thinks this is a catastrophe, him more than anyone else.\u201d\n\n>Four days into the war, Putin\u2019s economic brains trust clustered together at the far end of a 20ft table in the Kremlin as Putin \u2014 evidently pleased with his bizarre joke that the US was \u201cthe empire of lies\u201d \u2014 asked them how to mitigate the sanctions.\n\n>Nabiullina, whose attire has long been closely watched by some investors for coded signals, sat dressed all in black.\n\n>But as western countries cut Russia out of global financial markets and supply chains, the technocrats rode to the Kremlin\u2019s rescue, deploying deft economic management skills to defuse the crisis. In the process, they have ensured that their own apocalyptic predictions did not come to pass.\n\n>Within the narrow confines of the Russian political elite, technocrats such as Gref and Nabiullina were once thought of as modernisers, a reformist counterbalance to the siloviki, the hardline security services veterans at Putin\u2019s other shoulder.\n\n>However, when faced with a historic chance to defend their belief in open markets and speak out against the war, they demurred.\n\n>Instead of breaking with Putin, the technocrats have cemented their role as his enablers, using their expertise and tools to soften the blow of western sanctions and hold Russia\u2019s wartime economy together, according to former officials.\n\n>Russia\u2019s economy has avoided the most dramatic predictions that western economists \u2014 and the technocrats themselves \u2014 had made about the impact of sanctions, with the hit to GDP likely to be in the order of 3.5-5.5 per cent this year.\n\n>Though Russia is largely cut out of the global banking and payments systems, the economy has been able to fall back on ready replacements that had been created by the technocrats.\n\n>\u201cThe economic team really saved him. That\u2019s why he keeps them around. If the siloviki had been in control [of the economy] the GDP fall really would have been 10-15 per cent,\u201d a former senior Russian official says. \u201cHe\u2019s not crazy. That\u2019s why he left them in their jobs.\u201d\n\n>The FT spoke to more than 20 Russian current and former officials, oligarchs, bankers and economists who described the technocrats\u2019 dilemma. The Kremlin, Russia\u2019s central bank and Sberbank did not respond to requests for comment. Russian financial news outlet Frank Media first reported on the presentation.\n\n>As the war rages on, critics say their continued silence while they help the Russian state tick along has become a form of acceptance, making them complicit in a war they privately profess to oppose.\n\n>\u201cBeing on Putin\u2019s team means that you share his values, you share his principles, and you are enormously loyal to him,\u201d says Sergei Aleksashenko, a former deputy governor of the central bank.\n\n>\u201cIt was not possible to be on Putin\u2019s team after 2012,\u201d when he returned to the Kremlin after a four-year hiatus, \u201cif you have even some degree of disloyalty. So I\u2019m really not surprised all of them decided to stay\u201d.\n\n>**The orthodox path**\n\n>In almost a decade at the helm of Russia\u2019s central bank, Nabiullina carefully cultivated a reputation as the Kremlin\u2019s top technocrat. She steered Russia out of its 2014 economic crisis, tamed inflation through ultra-hawkish monetary policy and took on powerful vested interests in the notoriously corrupt banking sector.\n\n>Her success earned her the trust of Putin, who backed her independence in the face of a powerful oligarchical lobby that pushed for Sergei Glazyev, a hardline nationalist and promoter of conspiracy theories who is beloved of the siloviki, to replace her. In December last year, Putin publicly endorsed Nabiullina over her critics, warning that Russia \u201ccould end up like Turkey\u201d \u2014 a byword for unorthodox economic policy and a rapidly weakening currency \u2014 if it abandoned inflation targeting to open up cheaper credit for businesses.\n\n>As tensions with the west over Ukraine grew, especially after the 2014 annexation of Crimea, Nabiullina moved to insulate Russia from sanctions by developing an independent payments system and amassing a $643bn war chest for foreign exchange reserves.\n\n>But the scale of the invasion \u2014 and the crushing western sanctions in response \u2014 still caught Nabiullina by surprise, according to Alexandra Prokopenko, a former central bank official.\n\n>\u201cNobody had a scenario for Russia invading Ukraine. There were stress tests for state companies and the banking system, but nobody saw a full-scale military conflict, frozen reserves and this level of sanctions coming,\u201d she says.\n\n>Nabiullina quickly set about dismantling her own legacy. Western countries seized about half of Russia\u2019s foreign currency reserves, leaving Nabiullina unable to use a tool that was supposed to protect the economy from turbulence. To stop a run on the banks and ease pressure on the rouble, Russia introduced currency controls \u2014 a measure she had previously told friends would force her resignation. \u201cWe destroyed everything we built over 10 years,\u201d a person close to her says.\n\n>Konstantin Sonin, an economist at the University of Chicago, reached out to Ksenia Yudayeva, Nabiullina\u2019s top deputy for macroeconomic policy and an old friend, on the encrypted messaging app Signal. Sonin urged Yudayeva to resign, warning her that she was helping the war effort and likening the bank\u2019s staff to Hjalmar Schacht, head of Germany\u2019s Reichsbank under Adolf Hitler.\n\n>Yudayeva said \u201cthere was a lot of interest in Schacht\u201d at the Bank of Russia but insisted she had a moral obligation to stay. If the bank\u2019s top technocrats quit in protest at the war, Putin would appoint hardliners like Glazyev to replace them and immiserate ordinary Russians through ruinous statist policies like price freezes, Yudayeva argued. Disgusted, Sonin deleted Signal and declared he never wanted to speak to Yudayeva again.\n\n>\u201cGlazyev would do the same things. There would be no difference between them now,\u201d Sonin says. Yudayeva did not respond to a request for comment. Russian independent news site Meduza first reported on their exchange.\n\n>Nabiullina\u2019s failure to anticipate the freeze on the reserves made her a target for pressure from leading siloviki who pushed for a figure like Glazyev to replace her in the spring, according to a current and a former Russian official. But Putin, evidently confident in her ability to steer Russia out of the storm, instead appointed her to a third term.\n\n>\u201cEverything depends on the central bank. If the central bank doesn\u2019t work properly the whole economy is completely fucked,\u201d the former official says. \u201cIf Glazyev came in, the rouble wouldn\u2019t even be printed on paper. They\u2019d just have to give out pieces of wood.\u201d\n\n>Nabiullina publicly pleaded for central bank staff to band together to help ordinary Russians survive the war\u2019s financial shocks \u2014 which she sees as the crucial part of her mission, according to people close to her.\n\n>But many of them decided they could no longer go along with it.",

            "body": ">Prokopenko, whose parents are Ukrainian, resigned from her job advising Yudayeva in the first few weeks of the war and left Russia. Though several junior and mid-career officials quietly quit the central bank and Russia\u2019s economic ministries, almost all of Russia\u2019s senior technocrats still remain in their posts.\n\n>\u201cThey had to resign, morally. But she feels she is doing her job,\u201d a sanctioned Russian oligarch says of Nabiullina.\n\n>By late spring, the panic had largely subsided. The payments systems the central bank spent years developing allowed domestic transfers to flow freely even as the sanctions largely cut Russia from the outside world.\n\n>High energy prices permitted Russia to grow its budget revenue \u2014 half of which comes from oil and gas \u2014 by 34 per cent year on year from January to April and helped the rouble recover from its precipitous fall against the dollar.\n\n>This was not all down to the actions of the technocrats, however. While Russia\u2019s dollar income from energy sales grew, the sanctions made it much more difficult for Russia to buy imports, leading to the economy running a substantial trade surplus. That eased pressure on the rouble, allowing Nabiullina to relax the currency controls and begin cutting interest rates.\n\n>\u201cThe central bank reduced the panic in the first day,\u201d says Sergei Guriev, provost and professor of economics at Sciences Po university in Paris.\n\n>But \u201cthe central bank is backed by riot police\u201d, Guriev adds. \u201cIf you asked me a year ago what would happen if the government announces you can\u2019t take your money out of the bank, I would say there would be a mass protest. But in this particular case, citizens understood that if they protest, they would go to jail or be beaten up.\u201d\n\n>Some of Russia\u2019s technocrats are worried they could suffer a similar fate.

But after deciding to remain in his job, Gref has said he wants to rise to the challenge.\n\n>\u201cLife has become more vibrant, colourful, and interesting,\u201d Gref said at a panel alongside Nabiullina in November. \u201cIt looks like it\u2019ll be even more interesting in the years to come.\u201d",
            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>Prokopenko, whose parents are Ukrainian, resigned from her job advising Yudayeva in the first few weeks of the war and left Russia. Though several junior and mid-career officials quietly quit the central bank and Russia\u2019s economic ministries, almost all of Russia\u2019s senior technocrats still remain in their posts.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThey had to resign, morally. But she feels she is doing her job,\u201d a sanctioned Russian oligarch says of Nabiullina.</p>\n\n<p>By late spring, the panic had largely subsided. The payments systems the central bank spent years developing allowed domestic transfers to flow freely even as the sanctions largely cut Russia from the outside world.</p>\n\n<p>High energy prices permitted Russia to grow its budget revenue \u2014 half of which comes from oil and gas \u2014 by 34 per cent year on year from January to April and helped the rouble recover from its precipitous fall against the dollar.</p>\n\n<p>This was not all down to the actions of the technocrats, however. While Russia\u2019s dollar income from energy sales grew, the sanctions made it much more difficult for Russia to buy imports, leading to the economy running a substantial trade surplus. That eased pressure on the rouble, allowing Nabiullina to relax the currency controls and begin cutting interest rates.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe central bank reduced the panic in the first day,\u201d says Sergei Guriev, provost and professor of economics at Sciences Po university in Paris.</p>\n\n<p>But \u201cthe central bank is backed by riot police\u201d, Guriev adds. \u201cIf you asked me a year ago what would happen if the government announces you can\u2019t take your money out of the bank, I would say there would be a mass protest. But in this particular case, citizens understood that if they protest, they would go to jail or be beaten up.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Some of Russia\u2019s technocrats are worried they could suffer a similar fate. Though many of them are privately repulsed by the war, \u201cthere\u2019s this fear that \u2018if I leave, they\u2019ll consider me a traitor and arrest me\u2019\u201d, says Prokopenko.</p>\n\n<p>As the war drags on, however, many of the officials have come to see their jobs as a kind of patriotic duty. \u201cFor the first 10 days, all of the elite was in a total state of shock.

Particularly those in power. \n\nRussians are really good at suffering.

More importantly, unlike Russia, the **quality** of these reserves is pretty high, with hard currencies comprising over 90% of total reserves. Now, this data is backwards looking, and their CB is definitely right for stress testing their balance sheet to the vagaries of a war. \n\nHowever, the bombing campaign started in early October, Zelensky asked refugees to not return to the homeland and asked those who could leave to leave as well. Further, it's important to stress that BOP crises are almost always characterized by sudden panic. Short of a nuclear war, there is very, very little evidence to back up a sudden drop in confidence triggering a run on the hryvnia. Lastly, keep in mind that the hryvnia has been devalued, so sudden selling pressure should, in theory, disincentivize further selling beyond a certain point, within the \"new normal\" conditions that Ukraine's currently facing. \n\n>One dire scenario predicted that Ukraine\u2019s economy could contract by another 5 percent next year, on top of the 33 percent contraction this year, according to a person familiar with the bankers\u2019 report who spoke on the condition of anonymity because it was not public.\n\nPart of this is that the initial estimate for growth next year wasn't realistic to begin with. The reality is that GDP is a terribly metric for most economies, but especially those where data integrity and sudden shocks are rampant. Both of these characteristics are present in Ukraine (and Russia.) That 33% drop in the economy isn't fully reflective of the state of the underlying real economy, which is probably considerably worse. What matters a lot more, and this can't be stressed enough, is the first issue, which is FX availability. Ukraine's short term growth contraction is not outside the realm of contractions that other worn-torn nations have experienced. If the West can keep Ukraine's current account coffers stable (a big ask, as the article does rightly point out, but very, very manageable), then the reconstruction challenge can be met with real confidence. \n\n>The biggest economic threat, however, is not a loss of connectivity but a loss of people. \n\nThis, I believe, is probably the biggest misnomer about the economic aspect here. Ukraine's refugees may or may not become permanent refugees, but the fact that Ukraine has countries virtually everywhere else in Europe willing to take its citizens, is a massive benefit for them. Remittances can be a major boost to the hryvnia, lower demand on the power grid due to household usage can be redirected to industry and import cover for basic goods is reduced. If you asked Churchill if he would have taken a release valve for their civilian population at the height of the blitz during WW2, he most certainly would have jumped at the opportunity. \n\nOverall, it's not the infrastructure destruction picture isn't one that doesn't call for some alarm bells to ring, but it is one that contextually, looking at history as a guidepost, doesn't seem to point towards a greatly unique challenge.

The jammer can be much closer to the receiver than the GPS sats are, and has much more power on tap.  Combination of proximity, and power, can overwhelm the real sat signals by many magnitudes.\n\n2. The receiver can try to be directional, avoiding inputs from below or to the sides, and accepting them from above, to reduce jamming effects. Or potentially try to use other rejection techniques.\n\nBut there is only so directional you can make the receiver since the GPS sats can be anywhere in the sky.

At some point the Soviet equipment stockpiles for Ukraine would run out compared to Russia's massive stockpiles, and at some point, there would be a critical breaking point where Ukraine wouldn't be able to effectively resist modern equipment. \n\nPeople are talking tactics, while in the vast majority of cases, the war is decided strategically. Yes there's the chance that Russia just took Kyiv and the war would be over, or Ukraine successfully encircles 50,000 men and their equipment, but on average, these are not usually the decisive moments of the war, rather war is more often a critical breaking point type thing. What's a few breaking points?\n1. Loss of men\n2 loss of equipment \n3. Loss of economy\n4. Loss of territory\n\nAnd others. If you lose any of these substantially, the rest quickly fall. The first is the lowest risk, the fourth is a also low, it's the middle two that are the biggest relevant factors. \n\nRussia is absolutely correct in their assessment that without western support, they should expect Ukraine to hit a breaking point in either economic breakdown or equipment before them. (I will not go into analysis about the factors driving occupations and partisan warfare). \n\nDue to western support, Ukraine will likely never totally lose on the equipment factor. This is the area where I see Ukraine most likely to win. 2 years from now, with consistent western support, Russia will simply begin to run out of key equipment pieces that define modern warfare, and as a result, Ukraine would dominant. A big fear here is that as Russia runs out of equipment, Western equipment support will also dwindle in order to force negotiations rather than a violent collapse of Russian lines.\n\nThe economic factor is one that I think favors Russia, but not by much. Economic collapse impacts a war not by collapse of living standards, but by collapse of \"living.\" There will always be enough rail for the military, you will always be able to scrap enough rations for soldiers. There have been many wars where civilians suffered greatly (which we have not yet seen fully in Ukraine outside of battle areas) and the war continued. Even if Ukrainians had to live on a piece of wood for fire and 1000 calories a day, it would work. This is especially true when you consider that the Ukrainian home front is far less important to the war due to western aid than in other wars. What would cause a Russian victory here?\n1. A severe economic depression to the point that Ukrainians would begin to literally die in their homes\n2. A severe exodus of Ukrainians as to compromise the war effort directly \n\nI don't buy either possibility as likely. I think if we got to the point that Ukrainians were starving to death that we would see direct western humanitarian aid enter Ukraine to deliver food. Countries like Germany in world war 1 never reached such a dire situation and very rarely in history have countries been able to force this kind of collapse. I think Ukrainians will suffer, but I don't think it's catastrophic. \n\n\n\nTLDR: Russia would win without western aid, continued equipment support is likely key for Ukrainian victory, I don't think the economic offensive will be decisive",

The argument here is that if the Russians take Bakhmut, it'll be easier for them to assault Sloviansk (to the northwest) and Toretsk (to the southwest) and Siversk (to the north) simply because supply lines to those cities would be threatened, but it doesn't say why those supply lines would be threatened. For example, there's a main road (T0514) from Sloviansk to Siversk that runs north of any line of contact, and just south of the Siversky Donets river. Thus, the supply lines to Siversk aren't going to be threated due to the loss of Soledar and Bakhmut. He's talking about three vectors being directly threatened because...Bakhmut sits in the middle? Bakhmut sits in a valley, like most \"sizeable\" towns/cities do. Chasiv Yar is on an elevation, and the Ukrainians can keep attacking Bakhmut relentlessly from there for quite some time. As has been pointed out many times before, this isn't a repeat of Lysychansk/Sievierodonetsk as both cities aren't being threatened simultaneously. Further, he talks about using the rail, even though the rail service doesn't even work? And the Russians themselves have severed the line from Bakhmut to Soledar. The loss of Bakhmut would certainly push the Ukrainian primary defense lines to the west, but it doesn't really mean the loss of any other major towns (not including Soledar, whose tactical importance seems to stretch only as far as Bakhmut itself is considered.) Further, without the aforementioned rail infrastructure over bridges, it forces the Russians to fight further from their established logistics hubs, and we've all seen how well that goes for them. I'm an idiot and probably wrong about most of this, but this analysis doesn't really spell anything out for me that makes the Bakhmut as a tactically/strategically important town clearer.",

I'm going on vacation. I am ready to answer questions, if someone has them and if it is not classified information.) Doctor of medicine.\n\n--- In the course of the SVO, we see how field units are changing - they are trying to master some experience, supply is improving. But about such changes in the organization of the medical service of the army, almost nothing is known. Has it gotten better or worse compared to the beginning of the SVO? How significant (irreplaceable?) volunteer help? How do you assess the overall level of paramedicine, battlefield medicine in the course of its? Do the wounded come faster, better bandaged, and so on? - I can only say about us. We came in with medicine not sufficiently prepared. In some ways it was generally super, but some aspects were simply absent as a phenomenon. Everything has become much better, the level has increased. A volunteer assistant is irreplaceable, without her there would be no seams, but tight (I write about medicine). The level of Self-interaction has grown, but there are no limits to perfection.\n\n--- How do you assess the level of training in providing home medical care in personnel/mobilized units? What is the percentage of survival after delivery to the hospital / nursing home and the provision of medical care already? - The quality of primary pre-medical care has increased compared to 2015. I estimate our survival rate is good so far. If he did not die in the position, we immediately pull it out.\n\n--- What is the mood in the troops? How do they assess the quality of those mobilized in personnel units and individual battalions of those mobilized? How ready are they for winter, for which positions are there problems in supply? - Those who came in were tired. The mobilized are very different, there are fighting, there are just rabble. Everything is more or less in positions. The preparation in the rear is very serious. We have problems with washing in the regiment, but I hope they will solve it.\n\n--- the question of the primary treatment of the wounded is it right for the wounded to reach the doctors (they put a tourniquet, put an anesthetic, immobilize)or are there problems with primary medical training for military personnel ? as with the rule of the golden hour, the wounded are quickly evacuated?. is there enough medical staff ? is he also in the first order, or is he only receiving from evacuation zones and further to the rear? the question is from the field of tactics of using medical units. - Primary care is definitely better than it was in 2015. They usually get to the doctor within an hour, which is why mortality is not high among the wounded during evacuation (unless, of course, he died immediately). Medical platoons are in the front ranks, the company goes to the front for evacuation, a paramedic or a doctor may be part of the evacuation group.\n\n--- To what extent are the medical staff and the wounded who need it provided with hot meals and bath and laundry service? - It's tight. We sort things out on the ground on our own. On the front in one place I saw a bathhouse and a cellophane. So, who is more experienced, he has everything.\n\n--- a delicate question and not entirely correct - are the \"rules of war\" being observed, i.e. were there targeted attacks on field hospitals? - There were. They hit the hospitals directly. In another part of the front, there was a reverse case. While the hospital was standing, it did not arrive, as soon as it was removed, it was covered. But it may be a combination of circumstances. About 3 months ago, there was information that the primary points are all in SIBZah, up to the operations in them. Khinzirs do not hesitate to hit hospitals.\n--- has the evacuation from the LBS been worked out to provide medical assistance during the thaw?How do you assess the provision of medical facilities and the qualification of med.staff? - I have experience of evacuation in the Donbass in winter. Medical facilities, including at the expense of humanitarian aid, are well provided. Qualifications, unfortunately, are very different. From excellent specialists to fools in uniform. If on average \u2014 tolerable.\n\n--------- Older Interview with combat medic --------\nHello, lostarmorovtsy! My business trip ended ahead of schedule, I dropped out due to injury two weeks before the start of the offensive, now I am recovering in the walls of my alma mater. I have seen and experienced a lot during these months.\n\n--Question-- Is there any tangible assistance from foundations/public organizations/authorities? And in medicine, and ordinary fighters.\n\n--Answer-- I would say - invaluable help. Our reinforcement group from the VNG hospitals was greatly helped and is being helped by one veteran organization of \"krapov berets\" - the senior of the neurosurgeon brigade began serving in the second Chechen in the 46th obron medical battalion, just formed, he gained authority and connections there. Former colleagues and classmates who work in private medicine help a lot.\n\n--Question-- In the field, how do you check the blood group and Rh?\n\n--Answer-- There is a group of laboratory diagnostics in the detachment. There is a stock of express tests, they are brought because of the ribbon.\n\n--Question-- Do the civilian wounded pass through you or are they on their own line?\n\n--Answer-- However, with civil health care in the territories, everything is not easy.\n\n--Question-- How does the threat of the use of the WTO and UAVs by the enemy feel in the immediate rear, and how much does this complicate the work?\n\n--Answer-- It feels very real. Therefore, maximum attention is paid to camouflage, dispersal and engineering training. Of the last measures that have been taken in the rear units - digging earthen crevices, which were dug in the Second World War.\n\n--Question-- If it's not a secret, how is the supply in the hospital?\n\n--Answer-- Now it has become better, the deficit that was in May-June was overcome, but in some places not completely. So, at a great price, consumables for ventilators.\n\n--Question-- If I'm not mistaken, did you serve in the hospital? The circumstances of the injury are possible?\n\n--Answer-- It was on the Zaporozhye front. The Khinzirs have been conducting aggressive reconnaissance there since the beginning of August, fighting with tanks and other armor. Brazenly, despite the losses, especially on mines. From our side, in response, reserves were pulled up, from our MOSN, a PMP was sent to the threatened direction, where your humble servant was also sent. We arrived, turned around, prepared to receive the wounded. About 8 hours later, 120 mortars were covered, I received a concussion and shrapnel in the face.\n\n--Question-- Did you have med crosses on your tents or other visual identifications of a field hospital? Besides, I may have corrected the khinzir with the UAV and knew where I was hitting.\n\n--Answer-- There were, on the roofs of the self-binding kung. But this has never stopped the pigs.\nI can't say much, and soon a month has passed since I was assigned to a bed. From my medicinal bell tower, the overwhelming number of wounded are still victims of artillery fire, but since the beginning of July, there have been noticeably more blown up - here both petals and monks with claymores of the drg-shniki ukrovskie got into the habit of putting on the roads. There were very few bullets, there were several days in a row when such wounded did not enter the squad at all. There are fewer burnt ones, too, and the bulk of them are victims of fires caused by shelling in warehouses and positions, violations of TB (the fuel and lubricants service is different here), crews of burnt armor are in the minority here.",

If NATO is going to make the threat, it needs to be willing to act on it... and right now everyone knows its not.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is why I talk about the Baltics and Poland. In the unlikely but non-zero chance that Ukraine collapses, they are next.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sure, that&#39;s why NATO has the small deployments to Poland, Romania and the Baltic States. They aren&#39;t really meant to stop an invasion; they are just there to act as a &quot;tripwire&quot;. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This war is already for the survival of the Russian regime, they&#39;re all in. I think that has been perfectly clear for a while now. And I doubt posturing on the Polish/Belarusian border would &quot;unify the entire Russian nation.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Of course, but that&#39;s the Russian regime. For the Russian people, losing in Ukraine may not be an existential threat, but when there&#39;s 100k troops on your borders threatening invasion, that changes.</p>\n</div>",

The question here is how long will Ukraine be able to continue such a war if the Russians inflict so many casualties? Personally, I dont think the number is that high, for example, it could be 50k, however, what I think is happening is that the Ukrainians are losing both trained combat troops equipped and prepared for attacks and also cannon fodder units. If we assume a lower death number and the loss of trained and equipped combat units plus the loss of cannon fodder, the question still is how long the Ukrainians can go like this.\n\n2. The Ukrainians conducted several mobilizations and the last mobilization happened in the Autumn. I make the assumption that when you conduct a mobilization, it means you are dealing with a problem and this problem is lack of men.\n\n3. The Ukrainians not conducting offensives that destroy or encircle Russian forces. Neither the Kharkov nor the Kherson offensives were such. In Kharkov, the Russians lacked forces that can actually stand their ground except for a limited time in one of the cities there and they were almost constantly retreating and even started transporting BMPs with helicopters. And, in the end, Ukraine stopped its offensive while the general assumption was that there was some kind or a Russia collapse. If there was a Russian collapse, why didnt the Ukrainian continue the offensive towards the separatist republics?

The incompetence of the Russians during many moments of this war is something that we can consider to be true, however, despite the losses of equipment and soldiers, the retreats, the failures, there have been no actual collapses of their military in Ukraine. Its actually the opposite if we assume they are gathering more forces while still weakening Ukraine. And keep in mind that Ukraine might not be able to rebuild and return to the state their military was previously in.\n\nSo, here is something that doesnt present the Ukrainian situation as good... and all of this is speculation based on assumptions that cannot be proven.
