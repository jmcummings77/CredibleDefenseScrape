        "body": "I will try to give an update of the tactical evolution of the front in recent weeks. As usual, my main source is the Ukrainian military observator Mashovets, and also several Ukrainian and Russian Telegram channels (e.g. WarArchive is excellent for geolocations) and map-makers such as, first and foremost, DeepState.\n\nKupyansk Sector. From here to the south of Svatove the \"Group West\" of the Russian Armed Forces is deployed, which encloses almost all the formations of the Western Military District. It numbers 67k men. The Russians are continuing to push strongly in this sector, attacking towards six different directions. They have considerably strengthened their grouping in this sector in the recent months and so have the Ukrainians.\n\nThe 25th and 138th Motorized Brigades of the 6th Army, with support from regiments of the Territorial Forces, are continuing to press against Synkivka from Lyman Pershyi. The 79th Motorized Regiment of the 18th Motorized Division (11th Corps of the Baltic Fleet) is in the second echelon after having arrived during October. The advance is limited but the Russians have captured several platoon-strongholds and Russian assault groups would be at the gates of Synkivka, which is defended by elements of the 67th Mechanized Brigade and of the 95th Air Assault Brigade of the UAF. The bulk of the Ukrainian 57th Motorized Brigade has also recently arrived in the area. \n\nThe 15th Motorized Regiment of the 2nd Motorized Division of the 1st Tank Army is attacking from Pershotravneve, supported by the 11th Tank Regiment of the 18th Motorized Division, which has received reinforcements in terms of a \u201cStorm\u201d detachment. They advanced a few hundred meters. The Ukrainians have lately deployed a battalion of the 30th Mech Brigade in this area, which is in addition to the reinforcements I had written about [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/17p276b/comment/k83it77) and the brigades already in the area from before, namely the 14th Mech, 41st Mech, 115th Mech and 103rd TDF Brigade and a battalion of the 4th Tank Brigade. The new 44th Mech Brigade has also seen its first deployment, further south, in Andriivka, where a Leopard 1A5 of this brigade was lost. The Ukrainian grouping in the Kupyansk sector has increased tremendously in size since May. During the winter and spring there were only the 14th Mech Brigade along with a TDF brigade in the sector if I remember correctly, but most of the Russian formations of the Western MD were in Belarus reconstituting at the time.\n\nElements of the 4th Tank Division of the 1st Tank Army are attacking from Orlyanka and Yahidne, along with the 272nd Motorized Regiment of the 47th Tank Division of the same army. They reportedly had some success, counterattacking and recovering some territory that had been liberated by the Ukrainians a few weeks ago. The (tactically important) Hill 195 remains in Ukrainian hands.\n\nElements of the 47th Tank Division are attacking from slightly further south towards the Ivanivka-Kyslivka line. This division is being brought towards full capability - remember that it had been created in 2021 by reforming the 6th Tank Brigade, which became the 26th Tank Regiment. It has recently received the new 153rd Tank Regiment (fully equipped), deployed in this sector. In the recent weeks the Russians have been gaining ground in this specific area; the two settlements are in any case firmly in Ukrainian hands. The 380th Motorized Regiment, a unit created in 2023 that would belong to this division, was recently deployed to Raihorodka, having spent the past few months guarding the state border in Kursk Oblast. The 27th Motorized Brigade of the 1st Tank Army is attacking from Kuzemivka, without success. The 7th Separate Motorized Regiment of the 11th Corps is attacking towards Krokhmalne with the aim of reaching the P07 Highway, without success.\n\nLet's try to understand the Russian goals in this area. Since August, the Russians have been attacking continuously. Mashovets explained that most attacks (not only in this sector) are the work of 10/12 men-strong assault squads, supported by artillery in a suppressive role, with the objective of advancing along forest belts and capturing Ukrainian platoon-strongholds. Armored vehicles are used, but not that often. This Wagner-style tactic is judged to be more effective in terms of yield loss ratio compared to armored/mechanized fists. Through attacks with glide bombs they have destroyed Ukrainian bridges over the Oskil and at the moment supplies arrive via trucks from Borova. This is in any case sustainable for Ukrainian logistics and allows them to supply a Ukrainian grouping that the Russians estimate being 30k men-strong. We are now able to understand the Russian maximalist objective initiated in July of this summer, by attacking from Raihorodka and Kovalivka in order to reach Borova and subsequently drive the Ukrainians out of the eastern bank of the Oskil \u2013 entirely, north of Borova, and partly, to the south. That goal has failed and the Russians are concentrating their efforts directly in the Kupyansk area.\n\nThe Svatove sector is quiet. The Ukrainians had stopped the offensive of the 3rd Motorized Division of the 20th Army (WMD) against Novojehorivka and Makiivka, and the withdrawal of the 2nd Army (Central MD) can definitely be felt. The Ukrainians had improved their tactical positions in the area near Novojehorivka.\n\nFrom Makiivka begins the 43k men-strong  \u201cGroup Center\u201d. It currently encompasses formations of the new 25th Army (likely CMD \u2013 even though it received officers, both senior and junior, from the 36th Army of the EMD), some elements of the 90th Tank Division (41 Army, CMD), the 144th Motorized Division of the 20th Army (WMD) and some brigades of the 2nd Corps (8th Army, SMD) that are active in the Siversk salient, just south of the Siversky Donets. \n\nFrom Dibrova, elements of the 164th Motorized Brigade of the 25th Army reportedly attempted a reconnaissance in force towards the electrical substation in the western part of the Serebrianka Forest, without any success. Units of the 228th Motorized Regiment of the 90th Tank Division (41st Army) are reportedly being withdrawn from the Torske salient and replaced with units of the 488th Motorized Regiment of the 144th Motorized Division (20th Army), which probably means that the formers are heading to Avdiivka. For Mashovets, the regiments of the 144th Motorized Division have received serious reinforcements in terms of replenishing their previous human and material losses. It\u2019s possible that in the future this division could begin an offensive in the direction of Nevkse with the aim of expelling the Ukrainians from the eastern bank of the Zherebets, occupying the axis between Makiivka and Yampolivka. In this case the Russians would attack from the watershed between the Zherebets and the Krasna and enjoy an elevation advantage. The ambitious goal of driving the UAF out of positions east of the Zherebets (and thus, in their potential plans, also out of the Serebrianka Forest) could be the first part of a major offensive plan towards Lyman, to be developed, if they have the means, during 2024. In the former potential objective, the 144th Division would be supported by the 36th Motorized Regiment of the 67th Motorized Division of the 25th Army, deployed in Chervonopopivka.\n\nAlthough the Kreminna sector is paying, from the Russian point of view, for the departure of all VDV and 41st Army\u2019s units, reinforcements have reportedly arrived that would partially make up for this. Mashovets urges not to underestimate this sector, at least in the medium to long term. Recently, the 137th Motorized Brigade, linked to the Central MD and built on the basis of the \"Ural\" Volunteer Battalion (formed in the summer of 2022 in Yekaterinburg) has been deployed. However, it would be under-strength (e.g., it would not have tanks among its equipment). The 31st Motorized Regiment of the 67th Motorized Division would also have been deployed and the first units of the new 11th Tank Brigade of the 25th Army are probably on their way too.\n\nSalient of Siversk - nothing relevant to say.\n\nBakhmut sector. This month the Russians began what they call \"active defense\". In fact, in both the northern and southern flank a sort of offensive has begun, aided by the deployment (Mashovets didn\u2019t confirm this, but from Russian channels I have indications of this) of the new VDV regiments. In the northern flank elements of the 217th and 331st Air Assault Regiments, together with units of the new 299th Air Assault Regiment of the 98th VDV Division, are attacking towards Bohdanivka. They have been successful, reaching the beginning of the area known as the \"garden center\", less than 1,5 km from the O0506 road. In the last month and a half the Russians have advanced about 2 kms in this direction, securing the entire Berkhivka reservoir. The paratroopers are being followed by elements of the 88th Motorized Brigade of the 2nd Corps with the aim to consolidate the occupied positions. Units of the 11th VDV Brigade reportedly reached and could have occupied part of Khromove, although I cannot confirm Russian rumors of a total occupation of the village. The Ukrainian grouping in the northern sector of Bakhmut was weakened by re-deployments; at the moment resistance is mainly put up by the 77th Airmobile Brigade; recently units of the 1st Special Purpose Brigade \"Ivan Bohun\" have arrived as reinforcements from Kreminna. In fact, Ukrainian advances in these areas during May and June have been completely nullified. On the southern flank, the new 119th Air Assault Regiment of the 106th VDV Division is attacking in the hills north-west of Klishchiivka, making some progress (in the order of a few hundred meters) and taking advantage of some rotations in the Ukrainian grouping in this flank, as well as of the decreased rate of Ukrainian artillery fire.

            "body": "It\u2019s clear that the Russians are aiming, in their intentions, to recover the high ground overlooking the village of Klishchiivka. The paratroopers are followed by elements of the 4th Motorized Brigade of the 2nd Corps to consolidate the occupied positions. The 72nd Motorized Brigade of the 3rd Corps, after being restaffed and receiving new equipment after previous very high losses (it would have just received 40 BMP-1/2s), attacked towards the Bakhmut-Horlivka railway, occupying the former grey area around the ponds east of the railway. Units of the 83rd VDV Brigade attacked further south towards Andriivka, remarking Russian control over the terrain east of the railway but without crossing it, despite false information on this subject from some Russian media. The 51st Air Assault Regiment of the 106th VDV Division and the 57th Motorized Brigade of the 5th Army (EMD) reportedly counterattacked north of Zelenopillya, recovering ground east of the railway. The Ukrainians might  have recently brought the 42nd Mech Brigade from Kreminna to this flank as reinforcement, and there is increased activity by the 93rd Mech Brigade.\n\nHorlivka sector. The only thing to report are the Ukrainian attacks (by units of the 24th Mech Brigade) towards the two tailing heaps west of the city. To my understanding, at least one of these \u201cTerrikons\u201d was occupied by the Ukrainians. Realistically, their goal here is to keep as many units of the 132nd Motorized Brigade (1st Corps) busy defending Horlivka as possible, preventing them from following other units of this brigade into attacks in the north-east flank of Avdiivka. \n\nAvdiivka sector. I tried to make [a map](https://i.imgur.com/M0WwF9H.png) (using DeepState's for the frontline map) of the (partial) order of battle, based on geolocations and according to Ukrainian and Russian reports. In the north-eastern flank, progress against Stepove and Berdychi by the 2nd Army of the CMD (the 30th Motorized Brigade was likely involved in some actions, but marginally, so I marked it as a reserve) and elements of the 1st Corps (8th Army, SMD) was halted. Rather, according to Russian sources, the Russians had to abandon the positions they had reached in the eastern end of Stepove, due to strong resistance from the 47th Mech Brigade with its Bradleys, returning to the forest belt just west of the Avdiivka-Pokrovsk railway. For the Russians, therefore, advancing west of the railway is proving very, very difficult, and costly. They even attempted a mechanized attack on Stepove, losing two BTR-82As inside the settlement. Russian efforts at the moment are therefore mostly focusing in two other directions: Hill 240 and Novokalynove. The first is a high ground at the junction of the Avdiivka-Pokrovsk railway line with the Ocheretyne-Horlivka line, bitterly defended by the Ukrainians, which if taken would give the Russians a local elevation advantage in the area. The second is a village that, if conquered, could open the way to Ocheretyne (in a context of widening the width and depth of the flank\u2026), an important settlement for Ukrainian logistics, particularly in the event of subsequent attacks towards Novobakhmutivka, south of the railway. If the Russians succeed in this ambitious goal, two supply routes to Avdiivka would remain: via Novoselivka Persha or via Umanske. That would be in my opinion enough to ensure supplies to the garrison in Avdiivka (and also, all things considered, still relatively safe), albeit with lower supply capacity and a greater risk of occasional Russian shellings/bombings against them. Hill 240 remains in Ukrainian hands while the Russians reportedly had advances of about 300 meters towards Novokalynove, which saw the arrival of Ukrainian reinforcements. The Khorne Group, which is the UAV unit of the 116th Mech Brigade, also arrived in Avdiivka, but I have no information to state that maneuver elements of this brigade arrived. The Russians control the whole tree line north of the Ocheretyne-Horlivka railway and are trying to move further against the settlement. The settlement of Nova Poltavka, in the rear and halfway between Pokrovsk and Kostjantynivka, is considered very important by the Russians for Ukrainian logistics in Avdiivka. The Russians have reported the start of fortification construction in Selydove (about 30 kms west of Avdiivka) but I would wait for satellite confirmation first: it\u2019s possible these are false rumors to create the impression for their followers that the Ukrainians want to withdraw from Avdiivka soon.\n\nThe Coke Plant is firmly in Ukrainian hands, although the Russians control positions around the railway near the huge plant. By mid-November they likely captured the water pumping station south of the Terrikon (not to be confused with the Donetsk Filtration Station) and could advance, south from here, from the eastern side of the railway. Potential attacks towards the area to the west of the railway to the south of the Coke Plant (should the Russians approach that area) are potentially very dangerous for supplies in the urban core of Avdiivka, but also very difficult to carry out for them. The Russians would also be attempting to approach the Avdiivka sand quarry, without success, at the moment. There would be advances in the area of the ponds to the east of the Donetsk Filtration Station and in the fields south of it. The DFS remains an Ukrainian stronghold, manned by the 12th Rifle Battalion of the 110th Mech Brigade, although the medium-term hold of this position is, in my opinion, not guaranteed. The most important Russian advances this month occurred in the industrial zone of Avdiivka, also known as Promka. This is a negative development that I didn\u2019t expect, as there has been a breakthrough of the 2015 lines. From a satellite view it\u2019s easy to see that this area, just like the vineyard area just to the south, was full of trenches. The Russians, attacking from Yasynovskyi Lane, likely captured all the industrial area and much of the vineyard (attacking from Yasynuvata-2 Train Station), but the holiday cottages in Skotovata would still be in Ukrainian hands, defended by the ditch separating them from the vineyard, as would the landfill west of the industrial zone. \n\nThe first advances in the Promka took place in early November; Russian artillery greatly undermined Ukrainian positions, along with direct tank fire against the industrial buildings, forcing the Ukrainians to withdraw. In this area the Russians deployed several \"elite\" units that were reportedly instrumental in the breakthrough in the area: the \"Pyatnashka\" Battalion (attached to the 110th Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps), the \"Hispaniola\" Battalion (a PMC close to the Wagner Group, formed by Russian football hooligans), the \"Veterany\" Battalion, (a PMC attached to the 3rd Corps) and the BARS-11 Detachment, part of the \"Kuban\" Brigade of the \"Cossack Volunteer Assault Corps\" (linked to PMC Redut) and Rogozin's \"Tsar's Wolves\" (yes, it\u2019s part of two \"brigades\" at the same time - BARS and units linked to PMC Redut are a deep grey area for those who follow the Russian order of battle). These are units formed by Russian volunteers, with good training and motivation and specialized in assault and reconnaissance. In the actions in the area they were supported by the 6th Motorized Division of the 3rd Corps. In the area of the former restaurant \"Tsarska Ohota\" (a huge Ukrainian stronghold), on the contrary, there was no progress (nor towards the 9th District). What the Ukrainians will likely try to focus on is the hold of the Skotovata area and of the \"Tsarska Ohota\"; they will also look forward halting Russian progress at the edge of the urban area of Avdiivka. At the moment the Russians are consolidating the positions they have gained in the industrial zone. After that they could take whatever remains of the forest north of the industrial zone and thus put the DFS at risk as well as approaching the first houses of the \u201cprivate sector\u201d of Avdiivka, potentially from multiple points. \n\nRussian artillery in Avdiivka can count on numerous units: the 120th Artillery Brigade of the 41st Army, the 385th Artillery Brigade of the 2nd Army, the 232nd Rocket Artillery Brigade and the 1st NBC Brigade (fielding TOS-1) of the Central Military District, the 400th Artillery Regiment of the 90th Tank Division (41st Army) and the 944th Artillery Regiment of the 20th Motorized Division (8th Army) would all be deployed there. The volume of fire is very high. The Ukrainians can count on the artillery battalions of the brigades of the Ground Forces deployed in the sector, the 55th Artillery Brigade and at least one battalion of the 148th Artillery Brigade of the Air Assault Forces.\n\nIn the southern flank there are reports that elements of the 35th Motorized Brigade of the 41st Army, which had disappeared during 2023, were involved in this month's attacks against Sjeverne and Tonenke, probably to support the actions of the 9th \"Marine\" Brigade of the 1st Corps (it has nothing to do with the Russian Naval Infantry), which in October had very high losses, losing a very large share of its vehicles. Some units of the 74th Motorized Brigade of the 41st Army may have been involved in the attacks in this sector but, to my knowledge, limitedly, so I marked it as reserve. The 55th Mountain Brigade of the same army is heavily engaged in the Opytne and Spartak area, and would have had relevant losses. In the southern flank the only major Russian advances happened in the first week of the offensive, setting aside some small advances in Pervomaiske and the seizure of the quarry between Vodyane and Opytne in late October.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>It\u2019s clear that the Russians are aiming, in their intentions, to recover the high ground overlooking the village of Klishchiivka. The paratroopers are followed by elements of the 4th Motorized Brigade of the 2nd Corps to consolidate the occupied positions. The 72nd Motorized Brigade of the 3rd Corps, after being restaffed and receiving new equipment after previous very high losses (it would have just received 40 BMP-1/2s), attacked towards the Bakhmut-Horlivka railway, occupying the former grey area around the ponds east of the railway. Units of the 83rd VDV Brigade attacked further south towards Andriivka, remarking Russian control over the terrain east of the railway but without crossing it, despite false information on this subject from some Russian media. The 51st Air Assault Regiment of the 106th VDV Division and the 57th Motorized Brigade of the 5th Army (EMD) reportedly counterattacked north of Zelenopillya, recovering ground east of the railway. The Ukrainians might  have recently brought the 42nd Mech Brigade from Kreminna to this flank as reinforcement, and there is increased activity by the 93rd Mech Brigade.</p>\n\n<p>Horlivka sector. The only thing to report are the Ukrainian attacks (by units of the 24th Mech Brigade) towards the two tailing heaps west of the city. To my understanding, at least one of these \u201cTerrikons\u201d was occupied by the Ukrainians. Realistically, their goal here is to keep as many units of the 132nd Motorized Brigade (1st Corps) busy defending Horlivka as possible, preventing them from following other units of this brigade into attacks in the north-east flank of Avdiivka. </p>\n\n<p>Avdiivka sector. I tried to make <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/M0WwF9H.png\">a map</a> (using DeepState&#39;s for the frontline map) of the (partial) order of battle, based on geolocations and according to Ukrainian and Russian reports. In the north-eastern flank, progress against Stepove and Berdychi by the 2nd Army of the CMD (the 30th Motorized Brigade was likely involved in some actions, but marginally, so I marked it as a reserve) and elements of the 1st Corps (8th Army, SMD) was halted. Rather, according to Russian sources, the Russians had to abandon the positions they had reached in the eastern end of Stepove, due to strong resistance from the 47th Mech Brigade with its Bradleys, returning to the forest belt just west of the Avdiivka-Pokrovsk railway. For the Russians, therefore, advancing west of the railway is proving very, very difficult, and costly. They even attempted a mechanized attack on Stepove, losing two BTR-82As inside the settlement. Russian efforts at the moment are therefore mostly focusing in two other directions: Hill 240 and Novokalynove. The first is a high ground at the junction of the Avdiivka-Pokrovsk railway line with the Ocheretyne-Horlivka line, bitterly defended by the Ukrainians, which if taken would give the Russians a local elevation advantage in the area. The second is a village that, if conquered, could open the way to Ocheretyne (in a context of widening the width and depth of the flank\u2026), an important settlement for Ukrainian logistics, particularly in the event of subsequent attacks towards Novobakhmutivka, south of the railway. If the Russians succeed in this ambitious goal, two supply routes to Avdiivka would remain: via Novoselivka Persha or via Umanske. That would be in my opinion enough to ensure supplies to the garrison in Avdiivka (and also, all things considered, still relatively safe), albeit with lower supply capacity and a greater risk of occasional Russian shellings/bombings against them. Hill 240 remains in Ukrainian hands while the Russians reportedly had advances of about 300 meters towards Novokalynove, which saw the arrival of Ukrainian reinforcements. The Khorne Group, which is the UAV unit of the 116th Mech Brigade, also arrived in Avdiivka, but I have no information to state that maneuver elements of this brigade arrived. The Russians control the whole tree line north of the Ocheretyne-Horlivka railway and are trying to move further against the settlement. The settlement of Nova Poltavka, in the rear and halfway between Pokrovsk and Kostjantynivka, is considered very important by the Russians for Ukrainian logistics in Avdiivka. The Russians have reported the start of fortification construction in Selydove (about 30 kms west of Avdiivka) but I would wait for satellite confirmation first: it\u2019s possible these are false rumors to create the impression for their followers that the Ukrainians want to withdraw from Avdiivka soon.</p>\n\n<p>The Coke Plant is firmly in Ukrainian hands, although the Russians control positions around the railway near the huge plant. By mid-November they likely captured the water pumping station south of the Terrikon (not to be confused with the Donetsk Filtration Station) and could advance, south from here, from the eastern side of the railway. Potential attacks towards the area to the west of the railway to the south of the Coke Plant (should the Russians approach that area) are potentially very dangerous for supplies in the urban core of Avdiivka, but also very difficult to carry out for them. The Russians would also be attempting to approach the Avdiivka sand quarry, without success, at the moment. There would be advances in the area of the ponds to the east of the Donetsk Filtration Station and in the fields south of it. The DFS remains an Ukrainian stronghold, manned by the 12th Rifle Battalion of the 110th Mech Brigade, although the medium-term hold of this position is, in my opinion, not guaranteed. The most important Russian advances this month occurred in the industrial zone of Avdiivka, also known as Promka. This is a negative development that I didn\u2019t expect, as there has been a breakthrough of the 2015 lines. From a satellite view it\u2019s easy to see that this area, just like the vineyard area just to the south, was full of trenches. The Russians, attacking from Yasynovskyi Lane, likely captured all the industrial area and much of the vineyard (attacking from Yasynuvata-2 Train Station), but the holiday cottages in Skotovata would still be in Ukrainian hands, defended by the ditch separating them from the vineyard, as would the landfill west of the industrial zone. </p>\n\n<p>The first advances in the Promka took place in early November; Russian artillery greatly undermined Ukrainian positions, along with direct tank fire against the industrial buildings, forcing the Ukrainians to withdraw.

                "body": "This lack of progress hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed and has caused debates in Russian channels. It\u2019s likely that recently the Russians have had to abandon positions gained in the last \"latitudinal\" tree line before Sjeverne because of Ukrainian fires. Mashovets pointed out that Storm-V detachments (comparable to Storm-Z) attached to the 41st Army recently received a batch of 150 convicts to replenish losses - which represents a small number and way smaller than in the past, when the recovery of losses of Storm-Z/V detachments at the CAA level involved batches of 5/600 convicts, and the number is insufficient to recover the losses. This may be an early sign of difficulty in recruiting convicts from Russian prisons and penal colonies. Obviously some convicts are continuing to volunteer for the front and will continue - Russia is very populous after all - but it\u2019s clear that the pool is getting smaller and smaller. Russia uses a \"carrot and stick\" stretegy with the convicts. While frontline discipline is very harsh, the terms of service (6 months in Wagner, 12 months in Storm Z) seem to be respected and at the end of service, those who survive actually do go home (if they don't want to stay at least, while mobilized and contract soldiers will stay until the end of the \u201cSMO\u201d), nor is there any evidence of convicts being forced to go to Ukraine against their will. The reasons for this are due, in my view, to the risk of fragging and shooting spree events. Russia is also introducing organic \"Storm\" battalions in  its brigades/regiments: in this case we are talking about units vocated to assault and made up of contract (or mobilized) soldiers. Mashovets, 15ish days ago, estimated the Russian grouping in Avdiivka being 68/69k men-strong. Possible further reinforcements in the short term could come in the form of other units of the 90th Tank Division.\n\nRussian attacks continue south of Donetsk. The 5th Motorized Brigade of 1st Corps attacked in the fields between Krasnahorivka and Marinka, without success. The 103rd Motorized Regiment of the 150th Motorized Division (8th Army) continues to press inside Marinka, recently managing to take a small block along Kashtanova Road. Let's say the only successes in the recent months in Marinka is the growth from 75 to 80% of the share of the town under Russian control.\n\nFurther south, the 33rd Motorized Regiment of the 20th Motorized Division (8th Army), along with elements of the 255th Motorized Regiment of the same division, are attacking towards Pobjeda, without success.\n\nAttacks by the 39th Motorized Brigade of the 68th Corps (EMD) towards Novomykhailivka continue. In recent weeks they have further advanced south of the village, with advances between 1 and 1,5 km. In any case, the resistance of the 79th Air Assault Brigade, which has to defend from Krasnahorivka (north of Marinka) up to the \"corner\" formed by the front line south of Solodke and which can only count on a few TDF battalions as reinforcements, is an unsung story in my opinion.\n\nFrom here to the Mokri Yaly River in the Velyka Novosilka sector there\u2019s quite little to write. There were attacks by the 36th Motorized Brigade (29th Army, EMD) between Vuhledar and Mykilske and by the 37th Motorized Brigade (36th Army, EMD) between Urozhaine and Novodonetske, repulsed (with human and material losses for the Russians, especially in the latter case), by the 72nd Mech Brigade and the 58th Motorized Brigade of the UAF, respectively.\n\nIn any case, it should be mentioned that in the Velyka Novosilka sector, the UAF has been on the defensive since September. There would be only TDF units in the western bank of the Mokri Yaly. Particularly near Pryyutne, the situation is delicate. The 394th Motorized Regiment of the 127th Motorized Division (5th Army, EMD) continuously attacks the Ukrainian positions, with infantry-only clashes. The Russians have reportedly taken the entire Hrusheva ravine and lately are advancing along the tree lines north-east of Pryyutne, with advances of almost 1 km in the direction of Staromaiorske, which is in danger of finding the Russians not only to the south but also to the west. In this area the Russians enjoy an elevation advantage, controlling Hill 170 and 160.\n\nThe Polohy sector is quiet. The Russians transferred the 177th Naval Infantry Regiment of the Caspian Flotilla, which used to reinforce the 35th Army (EMD), to Kherson. \n\nOrikhiv sector. November, in general silence, was the most prolific month since August, despite the transfer of the 47th Mech Brigade to Avdiivka. The 33rd and 65th Mech Brigades advanced west of Robotyne and, more recently, south-west towards the positions of the 136th Motorized Brigade of the 58th Army. The 46th Airmobile Brigade has made some small progress approaching Novoprokopivka, garrisoned by the remnants  of the 42nd Motorized Division of the 58th Army (SMD) supported by several regiments of the Territorial Forces. Units of the Ukrainian 82nd Air Assault Brigade, of the 71st Jager Brigade, and of the \"Kara-Dag\" Brigade of the Offensive Guard managed to dislodge units of the 247th Air Assault Regiment (7th VDV Division) out of Hill 140 and from the other heights north-west of Verbove, which had been a thorn in their side during August and September for the attacks towards Verbove, which the Russians still control in its entirety. The \u201cChervona Kalyna\" Brigade of the OG had success further north, in Novopokrovka, against the positions of the 108th Air Assault Regiment (7th VDV Division). Only one tree line before this village is still controlled by the Russians. Now, then, what\u2019s the current status of the counteroffensive? It\u2019s no longer the Ukrainian main effort, but hostilities are far from over. Now the fighting is comparable to the summer fighting in the southern flank of Bakhmut, although with some obvious differences. In the past month the Ukrainians have widened the width of the salient by almost 3 kms (from west of Robotyne to west of Verbove), reaching a width of almost 11 kms. The Ukrainians will probably continue offensive actions at the tactical level in the near future.\n\nIn the Kamyanske sector, the Russians (elements of the 19th Motorized Division of the 58th Army) reportedly conducted some attacks, taking a bit of ground to the east of Zherebianky. Nothing serious however - the sector is quiet and in fact Ukrainian ambitions here have been dead for 5 months now.\n\nKherson sector / Dnipro River. The Ukrainians continue to maintain a solid infantry-bridgehead in Krynky: a strip of at least 2,5 km of the settlement is in their hands, they also control the forest area south of Krynky with a depth of a few hundred meters. The Ukrainians involved in the actions here are several companies of the 35th and 36th Marine Brigades - the results they are achieving are exceptional in terms of headaches for the Russians. The \"birds of Magyar\" are very active in the area, although so are the Russian Lancets, with the Ukrainian artillery paying a not insignificant price during November in terms of howitzers lost.\n\nMashovets wrote of how Teplinsky, fearful of losses, sends the Russian infantry in small groups against Krynky, fearing the actions of Ukrainian artillery and FPV drones, but this in turn allows the Ukrainians to engage in clashes with groups of Russians that are too small to prevail.\n\nRecall that Teplinsky (Commander-in-chief of the VDV) in October had been put in charge of the \"Group Dnipro\u201d, which numbers 70k men. Certainly with the end of the summer the trend that wanted this grouping to be the basin to reinforce the groupings in the southern front ended - and indeed, it\u2019s receiving reinforcements. The 177th Naval Infantry Regiment (which is unsuccessfully attacking Ukrainian positions between the Antonovskiy railway bridge and Poima) has been deployed here, so was the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade which is being restored after the fighting in Robotyne (its air assault battalion is involved in actions against the Krynky bridgehead, attacking from Korsunka).\n\nElements of the 70th Motorized Division of the new 18th Army (SMD) and the 144th Motorized Brigade of the 40th Corps of the same army are also active towards Krynky. Let's say that the \u201cbaptism of fire\u201d for these new units was rather disappointing... This [video](https://nitter.net/wartranslated/status/1727980325249138795) reports major losses in a battalion of the 26th Motorized Regiment of the 70th Division, active against Krynky. The 28th Motorized Regiment of the same division had been involved in actions against Ukrainian positions in September and had also suffered losses. The 144th Brigade, aided by Storm-Z detachments, has been unable to reduce the Ukrainian control in Krynky for several weeks now.\n\nUnits of the 205th Motorized Brigade (49th Army, SMD) reportedly attacked Ukrainian positions in the area of the solar power plant in Pidstepne, but without success. Along the Konka River, in the vicinity of Oleshky, small Ukrainian units are harassing the 22nd Corps of the 18th Army.\n\nTeplinsky obtained the deployment of the newly formed 104th VDV Division to Kherson (created by reforming the 31st VDV Brigade). The 328th Air Assault Regiment has already been deployed and units of it are involved in actions against Krynky. The 337th Air Assault Regiment is reportedly arriving during these days while the 345th has yet to arrive. The division's 1180th Artillery Regiment and 132nd Tank Battalion are being deployed in the rear. Probably with this new division Teplinsky will aim to drive the Ukrainians out of Krynky and will use the paratroopers as a mobile reserve against further Ukrainian attempts along the Dnipro. My assessment of the Ukrainian actions here remains the same: without any illusion of frontline breakthroughs because of them, they are great for keeping as many Russians as possible engaged here (while attriting them) for as little effort as possible. And it seems to be working.\n\nThat's all. [3/3]",

The Ukrainians continue to maintain a solid infantry-bridgehead in Krynky: a strip of at least 2,5 km of the settlement is in their hands, they also control the forest area south of Krynky with a depth of a few hundred meters. The Ukrainians involved in the actions here are several companies of the 35th and 36th Marine Brigades - the results they are achieving are exceptional in terms of headaches for the Russians. The &quot;birds of Magyar&quot; are very active in the area, although so are the Russian Lancets, with the Ukrainian artillery paying a not insignificant price during November in terms of howitzers lost.</p>\n\n<p>Mashovets wrote of how Teplinsky, fearful of losses, sends the Russian infantry in small groups against Krynky, fearing the actions of Ukrainian artillery and FPV drones, but this in turn allows the Ukrainians to engage in clashes with groups of Russians that are too small to prevail.</p>\n\n<p>Recall that Teplinsky (Commander-in-chief of the VDV) in October had been put in charge of the &quot;Group Dnipro\u201d, which numbers 70k men. Certainly with the end of the summer the trend that wanted this grouping to be the basin to reinforce the groupings in the southern front ended - and indeed, it\u2019s receiving reinforcements. The 177th Naval Infantry Regiment (which is unsuccessfully attacking Ukrainian positions between the Antonovskiy railway bridge and Poima) has been deployed here, so was the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade which is being restored after the fighting in Robotyne (its air assault battalion is involved in actions against the Krynky bridgehead, attacking from Korsunka).</p>\n\n<p>Elements of the 70th Motorized Division of the new 18th Army (SMD) and the 144th Motorized Brigade of the 40th Corps of the same army are also active towards Krynky. Let&#39;s say that the \u201cbaptism of fire\u201d for these new units was rather disappointing... This <a href=\"https://nitter.net/wartranslated/status/1727980325249138795\">video</a> reports major losses in a battalion of the 26th Motorized Regiment of the 70th Division, active against Krynky. The 28th Motorized Regiment of the same division had been involved in actions against Ukrainian positions in September and had also suffered losses. The 144th Brigade, aided by Storm-Z detachments, has been unable to reduce the Ukrainian control in Krynky for several weeks now.</p>\n\n<p>Units of the 205th Motorized Brigade (49th Army, SMD) reportedly attacked Ukrainian positions in the area of the solar power plant in Pidstepne, but without success. Along the Konka River, in the vicinity of Oleshky, small Ukrainian units are harassing the 22nd Corps of the 18th Army.</p>\n\n<p>Teplinsky obtained the deployment of the newly formed 104th VDV Division to Kherson (created by reforming the 31st VDV Brigade). The 328th Air Assault Regiment has already been deployed and units of it are involved in actions against Krynky. The 337th Air Assault Regiment is reportedly arriving during these days while the 345th has yet to arrive. The division&#39;s 1180th Artillery Regiment and 132nd Tank Battalion are being deployed in the rear. Probably with this new division Teplinsky will aim to drive the Ukrainians out of Krynky and will use the paratroopers as a mobile reserve against further Ukrainian attempts along the Dnipro. My assessment of the Ukrainian actions here remains the same: without any illusion of frontline breakthroughs because of them, they are great for keeping as many Russians as possible engaged here (while attriting them) for as little effort as possible. And it seems to be working.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s all. [3/3]</p>\n</div>",

If the barges were damaged or destroyed by the storm and aren't readily deployed, anything that floats and is massive enough to resist being pushed out of position by a handful of jet skis will do the trick. An out of commission cruise ship for example. There are several large ships like that which have been sitting in Sevastopol harbor for years now which could be put to that use. The barges are just serving as a heavy weight with a lot of inertia that can hold the top edge of the net in place in the middle of the harbor. Otherwise they would need to anchor the net on both sides of the harbor, which would make it logistically complicated to open a passage for their ships to get through.\n\nAnd the booms are really just the floats that I mentioned being attached to the nets. They just have more structure than a simple net with buoys attached at intervals ([e.g., a seine fishing net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine_fishing)) would have, but they are not significantly harder to produce or deploy. They are also extremely common equipment in any commercially active harbor, especially in any area where there is oil transport or production at sea, as there is near Crimea, because [similar booms are used to contain oil spills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boom_(containment\\)) and those could be repurposed for this use easily, and in fact that may have been precisely what the Russians did in the first place. They're like industrial strength pool noodles, not anything difficult to produce or source. So these are defenses which could theoretically be created from combinations of random boating and fishing supplies that are typically available in great quantity in any given active harbor.\n\nAlthough the torpedo nets probably are somewhat more formidable than a fishing net, so replacing them with whatever random rope nets are available may not be good enough to resist torpedo attacks. Historically anti-torpedo nets have been made of steel rings. I don't happen to know either way here, but if they are steel they should have survived the storm reasonably well even if they were pushed out of position. So it would just be a matter of untangling them and towing them back out into the harbor. If not made of steel they would most likely be even more easily replaced rope nets. Even a reasonably thick seine fishing net would suffice to keep a USV out, and possibly even many types of modern torpedo since they no longer include net cutters on their noses as WW1-era torpedoes often did, back when anti-torpedo nets were much more common.\n\nBottom line, there is no excuse for the Russians not to get those defenses back in place ASAP, beyond extreme incompetence.

Raisi was among the first leaders that MBS, as the crown prince is known, spoke with after the Hamas attack.\n\n>Alongside its conciliatory outreach, Saudi Arabia is pursuing another track. US Assistant Secretary of State Barbara Leaf said Washington is working with Saudi Arabia and its other Arab allies to stop Tehran \u201cweaponizing\u201d the conflict to strengthen its so-called axis of resistance, which encompasses armed groups from Lebanon and Palestinian territories to Iraq, Syria and Yemen.\n\n>A Saudi Foreign Ministry official and a spokesperson for the Saudi Embassy in Washington couldn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n>While its unclear how seriously Tehran has taken Riyadh\u2019s overtures, so far a regional war\u2019s been averted. The Saudis and their Arab allies still fear such an outcome\u2019s possible if Israel presses ahead with its military campaign to eradicate Hamas, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to resume after a truce that\u2019s led to hostage releases ends.\n\n>Hamas, which is funded, armed and trained by Iran, killed some 1,200 Israelis and abducted 240 on Oct. 7. Israel\u2019s retaliatory airstrikes and ground assault on Gaza have killed more than 15,000 Palestinians, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory, and caused what the United Nations says is a \u201chumanitarian catastrophe.\u201d\n\n>Hamas is designated a terrorist organization by the US and European Union. **Iran praised the assault but denied direct involvement.**\n\n\n>Saudi Arabia\u2019s two-pronged approach is giving a rare glimpse into its strategy vis-a-vis Iran after the restoration of diplomatic ties in March following a seven-year rupture. The two countries have long vied to be the main geopolitical power in the Middle East. The rivalry\u2019s spurred in part by Iranian leaders\u2019 eagerness to export their Islamic revolution to the rest of the region as well as their past rejection of the House of Saud\u2019s guardianship over Islam\u2019s holiest sites in Saudi Arabia.\n\n>The specter of a regional conflict prompted Riyadh to go out of its way to enlist Iran as a co-sponsor of the communique issued at the end of the extraordinary Islamic-Arab summit, according to officials involved in the process. The document harshly condemned Israel, called for an immediate cease-fire and laid out steps for a long-term solution.\n\n>The crown prince\u2019s focus is on de-escalation with Iran, according to a person on the Saudi side with direct knowledge of the high-level contacts. In their meetings with Iranian officials, MBS and his aides have also aired Saudi concerns over Iran\u2019s support for armed groups in the Arab world while talking up the benefits of cooperation, the person said.\n\n>>Saudi \u2018Evolution\u2019\n\n>\u201cIt\u2019s an evolution,\u201d said Elham Fakhro, research fellow at Exeter University\u2019s Institute of Arab and Islamic Studies. \u201cInstead of a more militaristic approach, Saudi\u2019s strategy is now diplomacy-heavy.\u201d\n\n>At stake for the kingdom is preserving and even potentially deepening the China-brokered deal signed with Iran in March, particularly through economic ties.\n\n>But it\u2019s also pursuing other goals like helping create a state for Palestinians alongside Israel, normalizing ties with Israel and forging a closer defense relationship with the US\u2014all risk putting it at odds with Tehran. Iran is committed to the annihilation of Israel and an end to all US military presence in the Middle East and opposes both the two-state solution and normalization.\n\n>**\u201cThere is a limit to how far Iran and Saudi Arabia can go in de-escalating tensions between themselves if the entire region is ablaze because of the war in Gaza or if Iran remains at daggers drawn with Saudi Arabia\u2019s allies in the West,\u201d** said Ali Vaez, Iran Project Director at the International Crisis Group.\n\n>The March d\u00e9tente emerged primarily out of the crown prince\u2019s desire to minimize threats to the kingdom\u2019s multi-trillion-dollar domestic economic transformation plan known as Vision 2030. The kingdom is investing billions of dollars abroad as part of that push, and Saudi and Iranian officials have previously talked of joint oil and gas ventures.\n\n>A key goal of Prince Mohammed is ending a devastating eight-year war he\u2019s waged in Yemen against the Houthis, a group backed by Iran that\u2019s targeted vital Saudi interests. In 2019, the Houthis claimed a drones and missile attack that briefly knocked out half of the kingdom\u2019s oil production.\n\n>>\u2018Ideological Tool\u2019\n\n>Complicating Saudi Arabia\u2019s mission is the fact the Palestinian cause is becoming an even more crucial \u201cideological tool\u201d for Iran and its allies against the backdrop of their economic failures and mounting popular anger, said Renad Mansour, a senior fellow at the Chatham House think tank.\n\n>Since Oct. 7, the Houthis have fired missiles and drones at Israel \u2014 most of them intercepted by the US and Saudi Arabia. The group also hijacked an Israeli-linked cargo ship and has vowed to continue such attacks until the war in Gaza ends.\n\n>**Iran\u2019s proxies have to mount attacks to show solidarity with Hamas but will probably stop short of crossing a line that would provoke a full-blown war**, Mansour said. Iran is reluctant to risk enmeshing Hezbollah or triggering a severe US military reaction, he said.\n\n>The Lebanese group, key pillar of Tehran\u2019s strategy in the region, has exchanged fire with Israeli forces almost daily since the war started. Those skirmishes have killed at least 85 Hezbollah fighters and around a dozen civilians, but are yet to trigger a major confrontation.\n\n>\u201cFor Iran it\u2019s a balancing act between going beyond their slogans of resistance and being pragmatic and not jeopardizing the status quo in which they are benefiting,\u201d said Mansour.\n\n>**The US is fully backing Saudi Arabia\u2019s push to relaunch its 2002 Arab Peace Initiative**, which aims to create a nation for Palestinians alongside the Jewish state, according to Leaf, the assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern Affairs.\n\n>Putting the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on a path to resolution was crucial to resuming negotiations over the normalization of ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia, she said, calling the strife \u201can issue that\u2019s been weaponized by Iran with its architecture of proxies.\u201d\n\n>\u201cThis crisis just illuminated what a threat it is to peace, order and stability in this region,\u201d Leaf said. \u201cYou stop Iran from weaponizing it by taking it away.\u201d",

Its launch solved the problem of protecting the orbital frequency resource of the SKIF satellite communication system.

In addition, the group will include Yamal communication satellites, Smotr remote sensing satellites, and Berkut observation satellites.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The stage of flight testing of the experimental communication system \u201cSkif-D\u201d with the spacecraft of the same name, created at the Information Satellite Systems company named after Academician M. F. Reshetnev, has been completed.  </p>\n\n<p>On board the demonstrator satellite, Russian equipment received flight qualifications, and the technology for controlling the device and accessing the Internet was tested.The maximum data transfer speed through Skif-D, which was achieved during communication sessions, was 6.5 megabits per second.The spacecraft was launched into orbit on October 22, 2022. Its launch solved the problem of protecting the orbital frequency resource of the SKIF satellite communication system. According to the rules of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), radio frequency applications must be confirmed again in October 2024: Skifa-D signals will be accepted by JSC RESHETNYOV.
