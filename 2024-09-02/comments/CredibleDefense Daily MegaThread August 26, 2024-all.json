Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

Profits in the coal sector fell from 248 billion rubles in Jan-May 2023 to just 8 billion rubles from Jan-May 2024, while exports of thermal coal fell by 40% from a year earlier, Kommersant reports. In Jan-Apr 2024, more than half of Russia\u2019s coal companies were making losses, according to Vedomosti. Russian experts say that the industry is entering its worst crisis in 30 years.\n\n>...\n\n>However, these factors are just the trigger of the crisis. The underlying reason for the struggles of Russian coal are Western sanctions. Losing the EU as a customer was painful for Russia because it is much harder to redirect coal to other markets than, say, crude oil. The reason is that the \"economics of coal\" work differently: Compared to other fossil fuels, coal is really cheap and heavy. Therefore, logistics are very important and a direct connection to the end consumer - usually by ship or rail - is crucial. For some Russian coal producers, logistics costs account for two-thirds of the final price of their coal.\n\n>...\n\n>Because of sanctions, logistics costs have risen. Russia\u2019s new \u201cfriendly\u201d customers like India are not its closest neighbours. Consider a coal shipment from a Western Russian port that used to go to Europe: Nowadays, it is likely to go to India instead. This is very similar to Russian oil exports. But there is one key difference: A large crude oil tanker (Aframax) carries around 50 million dollars worth of Russian oil, while a similarly-sized bulk carrier (Capesize) only carries 15-20 million dollars worth of Russian coal. If the cost of the voyage to India is assumed to be 5 million dollars for both of those ships, this leaves ample profit for oil exporters, but coal exporters will start making losses.\n\n\nCoal is less profitable than gas, which in turn is less profitable than oil. This is due to supply and demand. There's a lot of coal supply in the world. Hence, transporting it all over the world isn't really worth it, which is a problem for Russia due to European sanctions on coal.\n\n\nRussian airlines are also starting to struggle. Besides the increasing burden of sanctions, they can no longer rely on [flyover fees](https://www.rferl.org/amp/russia-ukraine-war-aviation-aeroflot-business-sanctions/33088356.html):\n\n\n>The pilots and passengers were in their seats; the planes ready for takeoff. But over 350 flights could not depart on schedule from Moscow's Sheremetyevo International Airport over two days in June. Aeroflot, Russia's state-owned flagship carrier, which claims to be one of the world's largest airlines, had run out of cabin crews.\n\n>...\n\n>The state-controlled United Aircraft Corporation's deliveries of Superjets and MS-21s have been postponed from 2024 until at least 2025.\n\n>...\n\n>That means that now not only are there not enough pilots overall, but \"you have pilots for the promised Russian planes who have nothing to fly,\" the expert said.\n\n>...\n\n>To find better pay -- and better working conditions, with adequate time for rest and vacation -- both pilots and crews are leaving, industry employees said.\n\n>...\n\n>And the flyover fees that, before the pandemic, supplied Aeroflot with one-third of its annual pre-tax earnings -- some $500 million to $800 million, according to Novaya Gazeta Europe --have largely vanished.\n\n\nThis is quite similar to Russia's gas sector, which relied on the lucrative European market to subsidize its other operations, especially the domestic market. Neither China, India nor Turkey will agree to similar terms, which is also discussed in the article.

This is more likely than an entire Russian take over of Ukraine since Russia has neither the local support or the military power to do it. \n\nOr it could take it all over and prop up a government which now has to deal with constant partisan sabotage and uprisings, making it even more of a resource sink, drawing further resources from conflict with the West. \n\nEuro NATO after a Ukraine fall could put more faith in NATO as Russia hasn't tried anything in a NATO country, after all. The collective umbrella worked, and not only that, a non-NATO country using old NATO equipment with a half trained military devastated Russia, showing that NATO doctrine and equipment is a good investment. So populations, some of which have fled from Russia to NATO's security, and elites have more faith in NATO. They continue to reinvest in military armament, and work closer as well on a number of products to provide self sufficiency and independent action.\n\nNow let's look at Russia not winning\n\nRussia doesn't win in Ukraine but the war drags on for another few years, costing Ukraine hundreds of thousands of casualties and hundreds of billions of dollars more in devastation. It also requires $100b per year in aid from the West. It ends after Russia withdraws to 2022 lines with a threat that any further advance will restarti the war. Ukraine doesn't have the ability to keep going in their own, Russia ignores any international court judgements for payment, and their foreign reserves are used as collateral for loans given to Ukraine during the war, meaning the near $1T in rebuilding costs has no funding means besides general aid from the West. The EU doesn't want to have that in so it's candidacy lingers, and with the Donbas/Crimea outstanding, it doesn't join NATO. It takes decades to recover, if ever.\n\nOr the war last another 5 years and Ukraine takes back all of its pre-2014 territory. All the above happens, just adding another $200b in aid and two years of casualties, plus adding additional territory to be rebuilt. Ukraine can join NATO, but the EU still doesn't want to let them in. Now a really poor country with a good but small military (as the bigger one gets demobilized to save money) joins NATO, means it now has to be defended which increases the cost of NATO as it is in direct conflict with Russia. \n\nOr $100b in aid a year won't cut it, and the West commits to doubling or tripling that number. Now Western populace and elites are wondering why so much money is going to a foreign country, or to buy local military equipment for a foreign country when that money could be spent in country for their own expense. Isolationism rises as Euro NATO peoples elect new elites to become more isolationist and focus on spending money on their people, and balancing their budgets. Ukraine still needs hundreds of billions of dollars in aid to rebuild, maybe Russia's reserves are used for rebuilding but they're already backing loans so maybe not. Ukraine in NATO, not in EU.\n\nOr the best case scenario for Ukraine winning: NATO surges hundreds of billions of dollars of material to Ukraine including a dozen more Patriots, hundreds of F-16s like Ukraine requested, a thousand more tanks, ten thousand more AFVs including IFVs, APC, SPGs, a hundred MLRS, tens of thousands of MRAPs/HMMVs, millions of rounds of artillery/rockets/mortars plus a billion rounds of small arms, a million sets of body armor,  night vision, and anything else they could request. The newly equipped Ukrainian military pounds the Russian forces with a wave of Western power in a manner not seen since Gulf War 1, and Russia firmly retreats with its tail between its legs to pre-1991 borders. Ukraine gets its hundred of billions of dollars in loans forgiven, Russia's currency reserves are seized to start the rebuilding of Ukraine including UXO clearing, it gets hundreds of billions in IMF loans to cover the rest of costs, and Ukraine join NATO with an ascension to EU on the schedule. NATO has pushed Russia back and all it cost was $1T+ in funding to a country that wasn't in the alliance and future payments to bring that country up to EU standards with the hope it grows into a productive member, and doesn't lead to a wave of Ukrainian migration or crashing the agriculture markets. Also, it likely would need tax increases in the EU due to budget caps, or budget cuts elsewhere. I can't imagine the population of the West being happy that much money is being spent to improve a country that isn't theirs, and especially not if there are tax increases. \n\nAlso, all that time and money that comes from the US detracts from its mission in the Pacific and towards China. Taiwan wouldn't be happy that the US has less capability or funding for them, that's for certain\n\n\nSo you're two scenarios of \"good guys win, everything is good\" or \"bad guys win, everything bad\" aren't the only outcomes. Messy middle outcomes are more likely, including ones that neither of outline. \n\nFor instance, there is the possibility that both sides exhaust themselves and Ukraine becomes a Korea situation, or a low intensity war like the Donbas.",

The neigbhouring units lost ~1500 (each) in the same timespan\n- Once they were at the front, the unit commander (\"an ex mall security guard that wanted to land on TV\") was getting them to attack from day 1. Initially 20 guys a day, in groups of 5, later partially groups of 2. If I understand correctly, there was a tank (wreck?) that they managed to reach and dig in under after a few days, and then they essentially just lost people relieving that position\n- He was only carrying wounded, as he didn't want to kill anyone, so he while he did even retrieve people from there, he never stayed there (all those that did died).\n- Wounded are only extracted if: They are in the rear OR they are just a couple dozen meters from the closest dugout OR someone takes initiative. When he was wounded he crawled back after being denied rescue over radio.\n- He had to hack the arm off a guy whom he carried back with an already rotting arm, because he was told it would take 24h to evacuate him.\n- A lot about drones, nothing new.\n- He estimates 400,000 casualties total for Russia (dead + heavily wounded) [Just thought I'd mention it]\n- \"It feels like\" a 50x advantage of drones for Ukraine (FPV/maverick/baba yaga).\n- 2 (ex)Wagner guys showed up, one borrowed money from everyone \"to buy drones in Belgorod\" and dissapeared.\n\nI think the above is all rather \"as expected\". Than there's some more:\n- There is widespread abuse among frontline commanders (\"40%\") of some soviet painkiller that makes you high - hence all first aid kits arrive without them.\n- The military police does not appraoch the front as they are too scared\n- As a consequence, on the front, there is no way to deal with discipline issues (like refusing to attack across a field when there's a baba yaga currently hovering). Hence, frontline commanders take matters into their own hands. Typically: Summary execution after being taped to a tree next to a ditch. Or being shot at close range with an AK while wearing 2 sets of body armour (broken ribs at least). Or being shot in the helmet with a pistol point blank. This \"only\" happened to 2/250 guys in his unit (refusing to attack while drone present), but was more common in neighbouring units.\n- At some point, he was ordered to attack while a drone was operating, so he went sideways to a neighbouring unit of contract soldiers. They found him and thought he was a mobilized from their unit who was running away (despite his ID stating otherwise), and were about to execute him when the other guy was found... The pit they were about to execute him into had 30 bodies.\n- There is widespread smuggling of weaponds out of the frontline into Russia, typically in bodybags. \"No one collects/counts the weapons from the fallen.\"\n- He is very worried about the future of Russia, where these cruel and dehumanized commanders & soldiers roam the streets with those weapons.\n\nI know it's anecdotal, but we don't get much insight into the Russian side recently, so I thought I'd share it.",

Which is something that we have had proof of for literal years at this point. Wagner convict units used to suffer near total losses, but would still go into the assault when ordered. Why?

Again, there's actually quite a bit of evidence to support most of these claims, coming from Russian milbloggers, video complaints directly from Russian units and/or their families, and documented practices.

            "body": "> So what exactly are Russia's goals/maximalist goals now?\n\nI'm going to state Russia's maximalist goals (as I see them) between square brackets. Russia's war goals are to:\n\n1. Take the four annexed oblasts: Donetsk and Luhansk entirely and parts of Kherson and Zhaporizhzhya east of the Dnipro river. [Take Kherson and Zhaporizhzhya entirely]\n\n2. Hold Crimea [and the land bridge which goes through Kherson and Zhaporizhzhya oblasts]\n\n3. Keep Ukraine out of NATO and the EU indefinitely [and replace the democratic government under Zelensky by a puppet government]\n\n> How likely is that?\n\nHard to say. At current rate I don't think it's very likely. For the near future, Russia might continue to chip away at Ukraine slowly, pushing them west meter by meter while taking heavy casualties, until they eventuelly reach an operational and strategic culmination point. Either their supply lines are stretched too far and the front can't be provided with sufficient fuel/ammo, maybe they run out of armored vehicles, or they reach the Dnipro river. To paraphrase what a Soviet general is alleged to have remarked after the Winter War: Russia might take just enough ground to bury their dead. \n\nHowever, under current circumstances it seems unlikely that the Ukrainian Army collapses and Russia completely overruns Ukraine. If Trump and wins in November and American military aid dries up entirely then Russia might be able to push Ukraine back still further in 2025, although I still don't see them marching into Kyiv. The only dark horse event that might result in total Russian victory is if China gets involved with weapons/ammo and boots on the ground. I view that as extremely unlikely, because it would ensure China loses all support in Europe (which is currently trying to balance the USA and China) and ensures an all-out economic war with the EU, USA and the rest of NATO. Nor does it seem likely that the Ukrainian people or the UAF revolt against Zelensky's government. He's currently very popular both within Ukraine and among its partners and there's no other Ukrainian politician with the same level of trust. \n\nI think the best Russia can hope for is to push back Ukraine behind the Dnipro in Kherson and Zhaporizija and then create a low-intensity frozen conflict similar to the demarcation line between North and South Korea (or similar to the Donbass in 2014-2022). That would technically prevent Ukraine from joining the EU and NATO, since those entities require states to fix all border issues before joining. But there can be found ways around that, e.g. Cyprus joined the EU even though half of the island is occupied by Turkey. So I do not think a 'soft' partnership and alignment with the EU can be prevented. \n\nOn the other hand, I think that Russia is getting more and more militarily, economically, logistically and demographically exhausted. If Western partners keep up or even increase the military aid and allow Ukraine to use long-distance weapons inside Russia, there's a solid chance that it's the RuAF which ends up collapsing. In that case Ukraine's war goals are to (i) make Russia leave Ukrainian territory, (ii) return the kidnapped children and hostages, (iii) prevent future aggression by joining NATO and the EU. (Getting reparations and persecution of Russian war criminals is probably never going to happen.) Putin might have to settle for that, maybe with some legal fiction of 'shared sovereignty' over Crimea and the other oblasts so he can pretend like Russia didn't lose them.",

By the end of Day 3, you don&#39;t have an air force anymore.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDWcg8dh930\">Zapp Branagan tactics</a> are not sustainable.</p>\n</div>",

Russia's military also does best when there is little change, and fails when their is sudden unexpected flux for a million reasons relating to logistics, command structure and culture, and technology.\n\n3) Take a page out of Vauban's book. National borders do not necessarily reflect anything about what is the easiest territory to hold or defend. Ukraine may be better off slowly ceding the Donbas, and eventually reaching some sort of more favorable defensive line than they currently hold. Likewise, pushing forward around Kursk seems at first blush to have improved Ukraine's defensive lines, and there is no question that removing them will cost Russia a lot more than it cost Ukraine to gain them, only to regain the border. Additionally, pushing from the border protects Sumy from terror shelling, a real threat.\n\n4) There is a strong case to be made that certain forms of attrition are the best way for Ukraine to force a favorable peace. Russia unquestionably has more manpower, but not all manpower is equal. Contract soldier bonuses are constantly increasing, an indication recruitment is flagging. Conscripts are far less effective soldiers than contract ones in all sorts of ways. Attacks like Kursk force contracts to be used manning the border from now on to prevent more conscript deaths, because if they don't conscripts are captured and killed at disproportionate rates. The best case for Russia is having conscripts used purely in logistic, and \"fleet in being\" roles, supporting the regular army but safe from attack.\n\n5) Offensives like Kursk do cost Ukraine more equipment it seems in things like tanks, IFVS, APCs, etc. but despite what people say that is exactly what Ukraine should try to be trading with Russia. Russia operates almost entirely from vehicle stockpiles that will give out eventually. As this happens Russia's offensive potential will be drastically curtailed.

It would be an entirely different story if they had solid guarantees on weapons, ammunition and financing, but they live in perpetual uncertainty past a 6-8 months horizon, they have people to take care of and millions of workers that fled the country.\n\n> Why then, would Ukraine pick any strategy that involves making costly and risky offensives to forcibly recapture occupied territory from a superior opponent who has a particular reputation and doctrine for set-piece battles and defence?\n\nThat's what happened in the summer 2023 and Ukraine did it because they were expected to by their partners who provided all sorts of vehicles and weapons specifically to allow them to do that.\n\nThis year, they're not doing any offensive \"to forcibly recapture occupied territory\". \n\n> Please educate me, as to why a strategy of fierce defence while bleeding Russia through destruction of industry and military capabilities, would not work.\n\nThat's precisely what Ukraine has been doing for almost a year until they invaded Kursk. \n\n> Rapidly and extensively building large defense works, barriers and creating heavily vehicle and anti-personnel minefields along approaches to Russia\u2019s objectives (which are very obvious).\n\nThe only thing I can answer here is that they don't have enough mines to accomplish something like what you describe. Russia has used the vast majority of its massive stockpile of mines in Zaporizhzhia. Ukraine has a small fraction of that.\n\n> Using Western and another advanced equipment only when either counterattacking and exploiting unexpected successes in counter attacks and other breaches.\n\nThey should use whatever they have available to exploit opportunities. Waiting a week to counter-attack after an unexpected success because said \"advanced\" equipment is far away or the unit isn't ready logistically isn't a viable approach. Believe it or not, but the Kursk offensive took quite a bit of planning and preparation. You can't improvise something like that. If your success is the result of a very diminished local Russian force, then it's either because Russia move some forces away (like Kharkiv) or because they got destroyed by you over a period of weeks - in all cases: it's not unexpected.\n\n> Heavily investing in the development of large amounts of long range strike weapons like ballistic missiles, cruise missiles or drones.\n\nHave you watched the news lately? There's a big raid on Russia every night, they revealed a new jet-powered \"drone\" (it's a flying bomb if you ask me, but I won't start that argument), the Russian losses from drones have increased manifold this year (https://x.com/Cyrusontherun/status/1828043368112312807) : you can't achieve that without heavily investing in large amounts of long range weapons and drones. They just made a choice in simpler technology so that they can field 5-10-20x more than expensive ballistic or cruise missiles.\n\n> This means hitting bridges, factories and other war supporting industries in Russia-proper, and especially in the hundreds of kilometeres around the border.\n\nThey've hit factories that are located within 1000km of Ukraine. Do you have an idea how little of that production is within that range? Most of it is in the Moscow area, the most AD packed area of Russia. As for the rest, they would need something like Tomahawks to have enough range to hit it. \n\nSo, why isn't Ukraine developing a very long range cruise missile to hit Ural factories? I can refer you to my previous answer, but more importantly: 1 missile doesn't do nearly enough damage even if you manage a perfect hit. These factories are, with few exceptions, nothing like white rooms printing chips or circuit boards. Unless you throw dozens of tons of HE at them, they can get repaired in weeks to have some level of operation. \n\n[The Allies dropped nearly 1M tons of bombs on Germany in 1944 alone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_bombing_during_World_War_II#Allied_bombing_statistics_1939%E2%80%931945) and it still had better production than it did in 1943. I'm not saying Russia would do as well, and we have 100x better accuracy, but you probably under-estimate how much explosives it takes to knock out a ~[1km^2 factory site like Omsktransmash](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uuTR15Ww8PAec9rz9).

It would be an entirely different story if they had solid guarantees on weapons, ammunition and financing, but they live in perpetual uncertainty past a 6-8 months horizon, they have people to take care of and millions of workers that fled the country.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why then, would Ukraine pick any strategy that involves making costly and risky offensives to forcibly recapture occupied territory from a superior opponent who has a particular reputation and doctrine for set-piece battles and defence?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That&#39;s what happened in the summer 2023 and Ukraine did it because they were expected to by their partners who provided all sorts of vehicles and weapons specifically to allow them to do that.</p>\n\n<p>This year, they&#39;re not doing any offensive &quot;to forcibly recapture occupied territory&quot;. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Please educate me, as to why a strategy of fierce defence while bleeding Russia through destruction of industry and military capabilities, would not work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That&#39;s precisely what Ukraine has been doing for almost a year until they invaded Kursk. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rapidly and extensively building large defense works, barriers and creating heavily vehicle and anti-personnel minefields along approaches to Russia\u2019s objectives (which are very obvious).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The only thing I can answer here is that they don&#39;t have enough mines to accomplish something like what you describe. Russia has used the vast majority of its massive stockpile of mines in Zaporizhzhia. Ukraine has a small fraction of that.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Using Western and another advanced equipment only when either counterattacking and exploiting unexpected successes in counter attacks and other breaches.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They should use whatever they have available to exploit opportunities. Waiting a week to counter-attack after an unexpected success because said &quot;advanced&quot; equipment is far away or the unit isn&#39;t ready logistically isn&#39;t a viable approach. Believe it or not, but the Kursk offensive took quite a bit of planning and preparation. You can&#39;t improvise something like that. If your success is the result of a very diminished local Russian force, then it&#39;s either because Russia move some forces away (like Kharkiv) or because they got destroyed by you over a period of weeks - in all cases: it&#39;s not unexpected.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Heavily investing in the development of large amounts of long range strike weapons like ballistic missiles, cruise missiles or drones.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Have you watched the news lately? There&#39;s a big raid on Russia every night, they revealed a new jet-powered &quot;drone&quot; (it&#39;s a flying bomb if you ask me, but I won&#39;t start that argument), the Russian losses from drones have increased manifold this year (<a href=\"https://x.com/Cyrusontherun/status/1828043368112312807\">https://x.com/Cyrusontherun/status/1828043368112312807</a>) : you can&#39;t achieve that without heavily investing in large amounts of long range weapons and drones. They just made a choice in simpler technology so that they can field 5-10-20x more than expensive ballistic or cruise missiles.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This means hitting bridges, factories and other war supporting industries in Russia-proper, and especially in the hundreds of kilometeres around the border.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They&#39;ve hit factories that are located within 1000km of Ukraine. Do you have an idea how little of that production is within that range? Most of it is in the Moscow area, the most AD packed area of Russia. As for the rest, they would need something like Tomahawks to have enough range to hit it. </p>\n\n<p>So, why isn&#39;t Ukraine developing a very long range cruise missile to hit Ural factories? I can refer you to my previous answer, but more importantly: 1 missile doesn&#39;t do nearly enough damage even if you manage a perfect hit. These factories are, with few exceptions, nothing like white rooms printing chips or circuit boards. Unless you throw dozens of tons of HE at them, they can get repaired in weeks to have some level of operation. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_bombing_during_World_War_II#Allied_bombing_statistics_1939%E2%80%931945\">The Allies dropped nearly 1M tons of bombs on Germany in 1944 alone</a> and it still had better production than it did in 1943. I&#39;m not saying Russia would do as well, and we have 100x better accuracy, but you probably under-estimate how much explosives it takes to knock out a ~<a href=\"https://maps.app.goo.gl/uuTR15Ww8PAec9rz9\">1km<sup>2</sup> factory site like Omsktransmash</a>. Oh, and accuracy doesn&#39;t matter when a B-52 carpet bombing run doesn&#39;t cover half of your target...</p>\n</div>",

Trading any of that back is possible but ONLY for concessions made by your side\u201d. Land in Kursk gives UA something to trade for return of occupied UA land. Without it they\u2019d have to trade neutrality, or limits on defence spending or otther items. There will be UA land Russia won\u2019t trade on these terms, Crimea, likely the land bridge, but there may be other places where they will trade a few hundred sq km of UA lands to have a few hundred sq km of Kursk back. This makes that possible, and possible without UA having to lose some other concession that may be critical for their future.</p>\n\n<p>4) Morale. </p>\n\n<p>A defensive war may make \u201ccost benefit\u201d sense to maximise Ru losses but it is demoralising on the military, civilian and international audiences for UA to constantly lose land even if it is inch by inch. It \u201clooks\u201d like a losing proposition where the only possible outcome of continued fighting is \u201closing\u201d gradually into infinity. This is not good for sustained international aid nor sustained covilian/military will to fight and keep making sacrifices. To have at least one area where you are winning/gaining ground changes that narrative from \u201cit\u2019s just a matter of how gradually we lose\u201d to a narrative of \u201cwe are giving as good as we get and this is a draw at worst, and we could start winning if we just push a little harder\u201d. It may sound \u201cmushy\u201d on a cost benefit spreadsheet but it\u2019s a real factor in the war that must be attended to by Ukraine. They just cannot be seen to be \u201cdefinitively losing, the only question is how slowly they can restrict Ru to taking land\u201d. That\u2019s a potentially war losing narrative to have take hold, they have to take steps to ensure they can present reasonably a different narrative to that.</p>\n</div>",

I think most people accept that Ukraine has suffered less losses due to the nature of being on the defensive against Russian tactics that often feel very brute force in nature, but by early 2023 we know that Ukraine had suffered high losses in the summer offensives to control Severodonetsk and Lysychansk, with one Ukrainian spokesperson saying up to 200 a day were dying across the front as they faced massive artillery disparity. Even Kherson was fairly casualty intensive despite the success. Even with the Kharkiv theater being a huge success for that year, it\u2019s hard for me to think that Russian losses amount to double that of Ukrainian.

I think most people accept that Ukraine has suffered less losses due to the nature of being on the defensive against Russian tactics that often feel very brute force in nature, but by early 2023 we know that Ukraine had suffered high losses in the summer offensives to control Severodonetsk and Lysychansk, with one Ukrainian spokesperson saying up to 200 a day were dying across the front as they faced massive artillery disparity. Even Kherson was fairly casualty intensive despite the success. Even with the Kharkiv theater being a huge success for that year, it\u2019s hard for me to think that Russian losses amount to double that of Ukrainian.
