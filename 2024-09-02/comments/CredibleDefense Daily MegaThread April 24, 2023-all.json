As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

The answer lies in the complicated dynamics of mountain warfare.

Seen from this viewpoint, the Galwan Valley is vital. The vital Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldie (DSDBO) road, completed last year, passes along the banks of the Shyok river near the confluence of the Galwan and Shyok. A thrust by Chinese heavy forces like infantry backed by tanks and self-propelled artillery could ride along the valley floor and cut off the DSDBO Road and imperil logistics to all the Indian Army\u2019s defenses north of the Galwan, especially a critical military enclave called Sub Sector North, around 800 sq. km just below the Karakoram Pass.\n\n>\u201cThe PLA can cut off our road if they come through the valley,\u201d says military analyst Major General Vinaya Chandran (retired). \u201cWe need to guard it by holding the heights near PP-14.\u201d The Indian Army had set up a post in the Galwan Valley near Hot Springs in July 1962.

A lot of the talk about China on reddit is around the same level as leftist South American dictators and Chinese propagandists talking about the US, which isn&#39;t a good look.</p>\n</div>",

That role is reserved for senior Party leadership and the Army. This sort of abrasive comment is the type of thing you would expect from someone not very serious, or perhaps someone making a domestic politics play. And yes, China does have domestic politics and political factions, just like every country.\n\nI can't say for certain,  but I would imagine this sort of statement is popular with hardline Marxists: after all, the fall of the Soviet Union was a great tragedy--and illegal from the Marxist perspective--for to replace a socialist ruling party with a non-socialist one is the height of illegality in a Marxist system. It's the type of activity that would've killed you in the 30s in the USSR, or today in China. To some, when they reflect on the USSR, they conclude the only just outcome would've been for the CPSU to resist Yeltsin in a protracted people's war or some similar violent conflict. Thus, it follows that every single post-Soviet state is illegitimate. And we have to keep in mind what the diplomat didn't say, but would say if he were fully honest: that the USSR should be restored. Absent that, the next best outcome for China is for Russia to be restored as a strong state & bulwark against Western powers. That requires the small ex-Soviet states to be reabsorbed into Russia.\n\nBeyond the ideological, there's also a legalistic impulse. Prior to 1917, there was just Russia. The Stans, the Caucuses, the Baltics, Ukraine--all were just Russia. The civil war and revolution changed that and birthed new nations, all under a supposedly equal union of nations (the USSR). Without that union, some would say it follows that the old status quo reverts--sans USSR, old Russia (and her territorial claims) return. To put it bluntly--a Ukraine without the USSR is just Russia. It's all rather silly from our perspectives in the West, that things can just snap back to how they were. We've lived and let live the collapse of empires within our lifetime, including the various colonial empires, and we've all more or less come to accept that reality. China, however, has a clear desire to resurrect historical claims over territory (see Taiwan). It follows that this would lead to this sort of legalistic impulse, especially if it can benefit China.\n\nI want to stress that I don't think this is official state policy coming from Xi. But Xi, despite being monolithic, is not a monolith of Chinese opinion. China has factions, and for reasons of ensuring longterm peace among nations, we should hope that these hardliners don't end up in power. It remains to be seen where these Wolf Warriors will end up post-Xi. Are they the next generation of leaders? Or are they more transient than that?",

        "body": "[Translated, **long**, opinion piece by Ukrainian Pravda:](https://www.pravda.com.ua/articles/2023/04/24/7399113/)\n\n1/3:\n\n****\n\nSupporting the Ukrainian Armed Forces (UAF): Waiting for the counteroffensive. How the UAF is preparing for the de-occupation of territories and how the leak of Pentagon documents is affecting Ukraine's plans.\n\n\"Counteroffensive\" has been among the top topics in both Western and Ukrainian media since the end of last autumn.\n\nIt gained even more attention after an interview with the Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Valeriy Zaluzhnyy, in \"The Economist,\" where he revealed what weapons the Ukrainian army would need to reach the front line on February 23, 2022.\n\nThroughout the winter and early spring, media and military analysts discussed the Russian offensive in Donbas, and later the future Ukrainian counteroffensive.\n\nVarious military experts appear on television screens, YouTube, and internet media pages every day, making predictions about when it will begin, drawing dozens of maps with arrows, and describing where and how the UAF will advance.\n\nRepresentatives of the military and political leadership emphasize that all of these conversations are nothing more than coffee table speculation.\n\nAccording to Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council Oleksiy Danilov, information about when and where the UAF's counteroffensive will begin is known to no more than five people on the planet.\n\nGiven the above, \"Ukrainska Pravda\" will not speculate on how the Armed Forces of Ukraine will act. We will focus on how preparation for the counteroffensive is going, what weapons are needed to carry it out, and how recent leaks of Pentagon documents mentioning Ukraine affect the future actions of the Ukrainian army.\n\nDuring the preparation of the material, \"Ukrainska Pravda\" spoke with dozens of sources [called interlocutor in this text] in government bodies and among the military. The information gathered in this text in no way reveals Ukraine's plans for the offensive (they are unknown to \"Ukrainska Pravda\") and does not harm the Ukrainian army.\n\nPentagon document leaks and the prospects of the counteroffensive\nIn early February 2023, the top representatives of Ukraine's military and political leadership held several closed briefings for \"the big seven\" diplomats.\n\nObviously, the main topic of these conversations was the prospects and timing of the start of a large-scale Ukrainian counteroffensive operation.\n\nAccording to the interlocutors present at the diplomatic meetings who spoke with \"Ukrainska Pravda,\" after the words \"the beginning of the counteroffensive,\" the most frequent thing said was \"April-May.\" This time frame was considered by cautious Ukrainian speakers as the most likely for the start of large-scale actions on the front.\n\nAt the beginning of April, there were indeed significant events directly related to the Ukrainian army's counteroffensive. However, their epicenter was not in the east or south of Ukraine, but in the United States.\n\nOn gaming servers, classified Pentagon documents were leaked and made publicly available. Some of them were clearly forged, but according to most experts, some of them appear to be quite reliable.\n\nImmediately, the question arose as to whether there was a Moscow trail in this leak, as, for example, the figures for military losses were clearly fabricated in favor of Russia. Most of the military and political leadership in Kyiv leans towards this version.\n\nIn particular, the head of the Main Intelligence Directorate, Kyrylo Budanov, said that it was a Kremlin information operation to damage relations between Ukraine and the United States.\n\nSome of the interviewed military experts from the Ukrainian establishment have a somewhat different view on the \"leak\". They argue that whoever stood behind this event, even if it was indeed a very expensive \"black swan\", the biggest beneficiary of it will be the United States: both Kiev and Moscow saw that Washington possesses a wide range of data on their forces.\n\nAnd most importantly, supposedly no side has a possibility of gaining a strategic advantage in these data. Thus, the US is supposedly sending a signal to both Russia and Ukraine that winning the war on the battlefield is currently out of reach for both sides.\n\nIn the end, whatever and whoever was behind the leak, the main question for Ukraine was whether this American negligence could jeopardise the counter-offensive that was being prepared. \n\nOfficially, through the words of the Minister of Defense Oleksiy Reznikov, Kyiv stated that the leaked documents will have no influence on the preparation of a counteroffensive by the Ukrainian Armed Forces, as the data, which was true, \"is no longer relevant.\"\n\nUnofficially, sources within the command of the Defense Forces also do not believe that the plans of the Ukrainian Armed Forces have been disrupted due to the American leak.\n\n\"This data leak will in no way affect our counteroffensive. Our real plans were not mentioned. We have plans, they have been approved by the General Staff, and we are moving forward step by step. The next couple of months will be difficult,\" warns one of the high-ranking Ukrainian military officials.\n\nHowever, in conversations with UP, the aforementioned \"average arithmetic\" was mentioned - referring to a forecast of when the counteroffensive will begin - which has shifted to May-June. But the reason for such changes is more likely due to nature and partners, rather than the leaked documents.\n\nOn the one hand, excessively wet weather with floods complicates military logistics and movement of heavy equipment. On the other hand, delays by partners in transferring weapons mean that a significant portion of this equipment is not yet in Ukraine.\n\n\"The curators of the counteroffensive\"\n\n\"The world loves winners. Understand that if we show success and the ability to win during the counteroffensive, this will be key in our partners' readiness to continue to help us in the future. Without victories, it will be very difficult to maintain support. So we need to win,\" explains one of the interlocutors of UP in the entourage of the head of the Presidential Office Andriy Yermak.\n\nObviously, the success of military operations will determine the further course of events in many spheres, from Ukraine's very existence within its borders and its place in the geopolitical game to purely internal political developments.\n\nOne interesting non-public meeting that took place at the Bankova in early April may testify to how seriously Zelensky's team takes the need to win at all costs.\n\nMore than ten people were invited to the meeting with Yermak: several deputy heads of the Office of the President, heads of security agencies, top managers from state-owned banking and energy sectors, several ministers and deputies who demonstrated their effectiveness during the full-scale war.\n\nFor understandable security reasons, UP decided not to publish the names of those present, in order not to expose them to additional danger.\n\nDuring the meeting, the head of the OPU told those present that each of them has a personal important task from the president: Zelensky decided that these proven people should deal with the issue of equipping new brigades for the counteroffensive.\n\nAfter Yermak's brief report, his advisor Daria Zarivna distributed several sheets of paper with infographics about the needs of their brigades to each attendee.\n\nEssentially, in the Office of the President of Ukraine (OPU), they decided themselves who to entrust with which brigade. The participants of the meeting are responsible for quick staffing - whatever the brigades lack, the \"curator\" must find it. Regardless of how or where, the issues must be resolved.\n\n\"In fact, this is a good idea of Zelensky's. These are his people, and they can really quickly help the military. And the president also gets another direct communication channel with these brigades, so no soldier or official can report to Bankova that everything is fine when in reality there are real problems there. And you can't even imagine what a plus that is,\" explains one member of the president's team at OPU.\n\nAs OPU interlocutors convince, this approach to staffing brigades in no way indicates distrust of the military, but rather is intended to provide them with maximum help.\n\n\"Many officials and managers know exactly how to properly and quickly set up supply chains for what the brigades need here and now. You understand that very often it is about political ties inside the country and abroad. All this should speed up the equipment of fighters and get a parallel communication channel from ordinary soldiers,\" explains the OPU interlocutor at Bankova.\n\nWhat weapons does Ukraine need for an offensive?\n\nIn the aforementioned interview with \"The Economist\" in December 2022, Valeriy Zaluzhnyy outlined Ukraine's urgent needs: 300 tanks, about 700 infantry fighting vehicles, and half a thousand howitzers.\n\nAt that time, Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov explained that the figures mentioned by the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are the needs of the army for a specific operation, and much more equipment and weapons are needed for the complete de-occupation of Ukrainian territories.\n\nDuring the winter and early spring, Western partners actively worked on supplying weapons to Ukraine. Despite several breakthrough decisions regarding tanks and air defense systems, there remains a significant number of controversial issues and deficit positions.\n\nIn particular, regarding the supply of modern Western F-16 aircraft, ammunition, heavy weapons, and mortars.\n\nAs told by a interlocutor in the Armed Forces of Ukraine who is directly involved in the supply of weapons, one of the most problematic issues currently is also the quality of what is being provided to Ukraine.",

How the UAF is preparing for the de-occupation of territories and how the leak of Pentagon documents is affecting Ukraine&#39;s plans.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Counteroffensive&quot; has been among the top topics in both Western and Ukrainian media since the end of last autumn.</p>\n\n<p>It gained even more attention after an interview with the Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Valeriy Zaluzhnyy, in &quot;The Economist,&quot; where he revealed what weapons the Ukrainian army would need to reach the front line on February 23, 2022.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout the winter and early spring, media and military analysts discussed the Russian offensive in Donbas, and later the future Ukrainian counteroffensive.</p>\n\n<p>Various military experts appear on television screens, YouTube, and internet media pages every day, making predictions about when it will begin, drawing dozens of maps with arrows, and describing where and how the UAF will advance.</p>\n\n<p>Representatives of the military and political leadership emphasize that all of these conversations are nothing more than coffee table speculation.</p>\n\n<p>According to Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council Oleksiy Danilov, information about when and where the UAF&#39;s counteroffensive will begin is known to no more than five people on the planet.</p>\n\n<p>Given the above, &quot;Ukrainska Pravda&quot; will not speculate on how the Armed Forces of Ukraine will act. We will focus on how preparation for the counteroffensive is going, what weapons are needed to carry it out, and how recent leaks of Pentagon documents mentioning Ukraine affect the future actions of the Ukrainian army.</p>\n\n<p>During the preparation of the material, &quot;Ukrainska Pravda&quot; spoke with dozens of sources [called interlocutor in this text] in government bodies and among the military. The information gathered in this text in no way reveals Ukraine&#39;s plans for the offensive (they are unknown to &quot;Ukrainska Pravda&quot;) and does not harm the Ukrainian army.</p>\n\n<p>Pentagon document leaks and the prospects of the counteroffensive\nIn early February 2023, the top representatives of Ukraine&#39;s military and political leadership held several closed briefings for &quot;the big seven&quot; diplomats.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, the main topic of these conversations was the prospects and timing of the start of a large-scale Ukrainian counteroffensive operation.</p>\n\n<p>According to the interlocutors present at the diplomatic meetings who spoke with &quot;Ukrainska Pravda,&quot; after the words &quot;the beginning of the counteroffensive,&quot; the most frequent thing said was &quot;April-May.&quot; This time frame was considered by cautious Ukrainian speakers as the most likely for the start of large-scale actions on the front.</p>\n\n<p>At the beginning of April, there were indeed significant events directly related to the Ukrainian army&#39;s counteroffensive. However, their epicenter was not in the east or south of Ukraine, but in the United States.</p>\n\n<p>On gaming servers, classified Pentagon documents were leaked and made publicly available. Some of them were clearly forged, but according to most experts, some of them appear to be quite reliable.</p>\n\n<p>Immediately, the question arose as to whether there was a Moscow trail in this leak, as, for example, the figures for military losses were clearly fabricated in favor of Russia. Most of the military and political leadership in Kyiv leans towards this version.</p>\n\n<p>In particular, the head of the Main Intelligence Directorate, Kyrylo Budanov, said that it was a Kremlin information operation to damage relations between Ukraine and the United States.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the interviewed military experts from the Ukrainian establishment have a somewhat different view on the &quot;leak&quot;. They argue that whoever stood behind this event, even if it was indeed a very expensive &quot;black swan&quot;, the biggest beneficiary of it will be the United States: both Kiev and Moscow saw that Washington possesses a wide range of data on their forces.</p>\n\n<p>And most importantly, supposedly no side has a possibility of gaining a strategic advantage in these data. Thus, the US is supposedly sending a signal to both Russia and Ukraine that winning the war on the battlefield is currently out of reach for both sides.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, whatever and whoever was behind the leak, the main question for Ukraine was whether this American negligence could jeopardise the counter-offensive that was being prepared. </p>\n\n<p>Officially, through the words of the Minister of Defense Oleksiy Reznikov, Kyiv stated that the leaked documents will have no influence on the preparation of a counteroffensive by the Ukrainian Armed Forces, as the data, which was true, &quot;is no longer relevant.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Unofficially, sources within the command of the Defense Forces also do not believe that the plans of the Ukrainian Armed Forces have been disrupted due to the American leak.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;This data leak will in no way affect our counteroffensive. Our real plans were not mentioned. We have plans, they have been approved by the General Staff, and we are moving forward step by step. The next couple of months will be difficult,&quot; warns one of the high-ranking Ukrainian military officials.</p>\n\n<p>However, in conversations with UP, the aforementioned &quot;average arithmetic&quot; was mentioned - referring to a forecast of when the counteroffensive will begin - which has shifted to May-June. But the reason for such changes is more likely due to nature and partners, rather than the leaked documents.</p>\n\n<p>On the one hand, excessively wet weather with floods complicates military logistics and movement of heavy equipment. On the other hand, delays by partners in transferring weapons mean that a significant portion of this equipment is not yet in Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;The curators of the counteroffensive&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;The world loves winners. Understand that if we show success and the ability to win during the counteroffensive, this will be key in our partners&#39; readiness to continue to help us in the future. Without victories, it will be very difficult to maintain support. So we need to win,&quot; explains one of the interlocutors of UP in the entourage of the head of the Presidential Office Andriy Yermak.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, the success of military operations will determine the further course of events in many spheres, from Ukraine&#39;s very existence within its borders and its place in the geopolitical game to purely internal political developments.</p>\n\n<p>One interesting non-public meeting that took place at the Bankova in early April may testify to how seriously Zelensky&#39;s team takes the need to win at all costs.</p>\n\n<p>More than ten people were invited to the meeting with Yermak: several deputy heads of the Office of the President, heads of security agencies, top managers from state-owned banking and energy sectors, several ministers and deputies who demonstrated their effectiveness during the full-scale war.</p>\n\n<p>For understandable security reasons, UP decided not to publish the names of those present, in order not to expose them to additional danger.</p>\n\n<p>During the meeting, the head of the OPU told those present that each of them has a personal important task from the president: Zelensky decided that these proven people should deal with the issue of equipping new brigades for the counteroffensive.</p>\n\n<p>After Yermak&#39;s brief report, his advisor Daria Zarivna distributed several sheets of paper with infographics about the needs of their brigades to each attendee.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, in the Office of the President of Ukraine (OPU), they decided themselves who to entrust with which brigade.

Their equipment is often also stored somewhere outdoors, and what looks impressive on paper is much more complicated in reality. This results in a weak supply speed,\" the interlocutor explains.\n\nHis words are confirmed by the top officials of the state in their public statements.\n\nOn March 25, President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that the Armed Forces of Ukraine cannot yet launch a counteroffensive, which was planned for the spring, due to a lack of weapons.\n\nA short list of what is most needed in the conditions of a counteroffensive:\nTo break the enemy's logistics lines and destroy the rear of the enemy, Ukraine needs long-range artillery, including Himars systems with long-range GLSDB shells (range of destruction - 150 km).\nThe Ukrainian army needs to disrupt the logistical branch of the occupiers that goes from the territory of Russia to the occupied Crimea. This will cut off the supply of the Russian grouping in Crimea, including their missile ships.\n\nFar-range artillery can also be used to destroy enemy air defense systems.\n\nTo destroy Russian air defense systems, Ukraine needs HARM anti-radiation missiles. They fly towards Russian radars, self-guide, and destroy them. The air defense system without radars becomes \"blind\". HARMs were developed for F-16 aircraft, but they can also be launched from Soviet MiGs. Additionally, the Himars installation mentioned earlier can also be used to destroy Russian air defense systems.\n\nTo destroy enemy aircraft and helicopters, Ukraine needs long-range air defense systems and a large number of missiles for them. This includes Patriot, NASAMS, IRIS-T. After suppressing Russian air defense systems, Ukraine will be able to use guided bombs such as JDAM (\"smart bombs\") more freely. They will help destroy depots, command posts, and armored vehicles. JDAM bombs are dropped from an aircraft, after which their wings open and they head towards the target.\n\nTo support infantry and destroy enemy fire points and fortifications, Ukraine needs tanks such as Abrams, Challenger, Leopard, etc. According to reports, the Ukrainian army will receive about a hundred Western tanks, which is not a lot. However, in addition to them, there are also Soviet and Polish PT-91 (a modernized Soviet T-72 tank). A significant amount of wheeled equipment such as \"Humvee\" is also needed for transporting infantry.\n\nThere is a lot of artillery, including NATO's 155 caliber. The Ukrainian army currently has the most M777 howitzers. According to rough estimates, Ukraine will receive about 500,000 shells for the offensive. If the active phase of the offensive lasts a month, the Ukrainian army will be able to fire approximately 20-25 thousand shells per day.\n\nCurrently, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are mainly on the defensive. To understand the needs of the army for an offensive, one can compare the use of shells by the enemy during the active phase of the offensive on Ukraine. From March to August 2022, the Russians fired approximately 50,000 shells per day.\n\nThe great \"Guardian of the Advance\" promotion, quiet preparation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and potential challenges of the operation.\n\nNew equipment and general conditions of the counter-offensive require a large number of well-trained personnel.\n\nFor the major offensive operation, Ukraine is preparing not just dozens but newly formed brigades of the Armed Forces and National Guard. At least 16 such brigades are known from public data (approximately 40-50 thousand people).\n\nThe most visible aspect, thanks to billboards, TV commercials, and bright slogans, is the recruitment process for the \"Guardian of the Advance\" - eight assault brigades in the composition of the National Guard. The ninth in this list is the \"Khartiya\" - the former Kharkiv DFTH in the composition of the 127th brigade of the Special Operations Forces.\n\nThe first thing to know about the \"Guardian of the Advance\" is that its advertising is not about creating new brigades from scratch, but rather reformatting and selecting people for already existing combat units.\n\nAnd this is, to some extent, good, because the core of the brigades includes units with already existing combat experience.\n\nFor example, the \"Rubizh\" brigade was created on the basis of the well-known 4th operational brigade, and the \"Bureviy\" brigade was created on the basis of the 1st presidential brigade. Both have gone through the toughest defensive operations in the East: Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, and Bakhmut.\n\n\"We thought that the 'Guardian of the Advance' was just an advertisement to recruit people to the National Guard. Because the military enlistment offices send them to the Armed Forces by the batch, and only 150 people came to the brigade \"N\" of the National Guard in a year. This doesn't even cover the \"200th\" and \"300th\" ones,\" recalls the commander of one of the reconnaissance units in the composition of the National Guard, who moved to \"Bureviy\" a couple of months ago, in conversation with Ukrainian News (UP).\n\nThe commander of one of the battalions of the same brigade, Kostiantyn Vakhramiiev, tells UP that his battalion (up to 700 people) is 80% made up of active military personnel and National Guard troops who have transferred from non-combat units. Only about 20% are recruits who came in response to the \"Guardian of the Advance\" advertising.\n\nEveryone who joins \"Bureviy\" undergoes a 45-day training. It covers the basics of military service, classes with instructors depending on the profession (machine gunner, grenadier, etc.).\n\nCombat medics, sappers, and sergeants are preparing abroad \u2013 in Poland, Great Britain, and Germany.\n\nThe distribution of 700 people in the battalion is roughly as follows: 400 people - assault infantry, 300 - artillerymen and support units.\n\n\"We emphasize assault infantry. After all, our task will be to go in and knock out the enemy, and then the Armed Forces of Ukraine should come in and secure the area. We have BTRs and mortars in our arsenal,\" explains the level of tasks of the battalion by Vakhramyeyev.\n\nThe aforementioned commander, who joined \"Bureviy\", assesses the current readiness of his unit at 75% in an interview with UP. They still have a month of training ahead of them.\n\n\"One of the shortcomings of the preparation is the lack of strategy. It is understandable that no one knows the counteroffensive plan. Don't tell me its date, don't tell me its location. But tell me, for example, what are we \"flying\" with - \"Maviks\", \"Storks\"? What are we using to listen to the Russians?\" - the commander shares his concerns.\n\nThe second thing to know about \"Guardian of the Advance\" is that some of its fighters are already at war. \"Bureviy\", for example, holds the front line in Luhansk region. That is, we are not talking about \"preserved\" brigades.\n\n\"There will be a task for counteroffensive - we will go on the offensive, but for now, we need to restrain the enemy in the east. And if we take all nine brigades and sit under Kyiv waiting for a counteroffensive, then who will be fighting?\" - Vakhramyeyev sums up.\n\nUnlike the \"Guardian of the Advance,\" the recruitment and training of new brigades in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which will receive Western tanks and long-range artillery, and therefore, are likely to be the main striking force of the offensive, are happening almost in complete silence.\n\nFrom open sources, it is known about the formation of the 47th separate assault brigade, which has Slovenian M-55S tanks, the 49th separate artillery brigade, which has Turkish TRG-230 MLRS (range 20-70 km). As well as several mechanized brigades, including the 21st, 33rd, and 118th.\n\nNew brigades are also being formed in the Marine Corps - the 37th and 38th. One of them is to be led by the former combat of the 1st separate marine battalion...\n\nFrom the available information, it appears that, unlike the \"Advance Guard,\" the new units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) will be created from scratch. This raises questions about their level of combat readiness and coordination, although little is currently known about the preparation of these brigades.\n\nIt is quite possible that experienced AFU brigades will also participate in the upcoming operation. However, who they are and how many will be used in conjunction with the new brigades is currently unknown.\n\nOne experienced and authoritative military officer, speaking anonymously to the Ukrainian media, called the use of exclusively newly created AFU brigades in such an important operation as a counteroffensive a mistake. This is because most of these soldiers will only gain experience on the battlefield.\n\n\"It would have been better to bring out real combat units, complete them, give them new equipment, coordinate them, and make them a real striking force. It could have been effectively used in any direction. And what are we doing now? We're sending new units into the attack. Someone among them will definitely panic and drop their weapons. They're people, most of them taken from the streets,\" shares the officer.\n\n\"The main thing in war is combat experience. Newly formed units lack combat experience, as well as an officer core, even though a few people have been transferred there,\" he adds.",

This is because most of these soldiers will only gain experience on the battlefield.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;It would have been better to bring out real combat units, complete them, give them new equipment, coordinate them, and make them a real striking force. It could have been effectively used in any direction. And what are we doing now? We&#39;re sending new units into the attack. Someone among them will definitely panic and drop their weapons. They&#39;re people, most of them taken from the streets,&quot; shares the officer.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;The main thing in war is combat experience. Newly formed units lack combat experience, as well as an officer core, even though a few people have been transferred there,&quot; he adds.</p>\n</div>",

It draws on fieldwork in Ukraine by the author, including interviews with senior Ukrainian Air Force commanders, military scientists, and inspection of captured and recovered Russian weapons and aircraft systems. The primary purpose of the study is to provide an open-source assessment of the enduring threat posed by the VKS to Ukraine in the short term, and to NATO nations in the medium and long term.

The deadline for proposals is 13 June. </p>\n\n<p>Three use cases have been identified and will be investigated as part of the competition \u2013 \u2018Biofeedback Systems&#39;, which will measure the user&#39;s state; the \u2018Warfighter Ensemble&#39;, which aims to optimise and enhance biological functions; and \u2018Sensory Enhancements&#39;, which will augment the human senses beyond typical biological abilities. </p>\n\n<p>HA technologies have the potential to enable the user to think and act faster, and have increased strength, and/or endurance.</p>\n\n<p>This is the second HA competition launched by the UK Ministry of Defence in under a year, indicating the importance the authority is attributing to the development of this technology.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I&#39;m really curious about these &quot;sensory enhancements which will augment the human senses beyond typical biological abilities.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>And I&#39;m not sure if this is worth the excitement/anxiety over cybernetic soldiers, or if this is the equivalent of some type of amphetamine salt patch for infantry.</p>\n</div>",

I'm wondering, especially considering the beachheads Ukraine has taken on the Russian side of Kherson river, is an amphibious assault across the river to cut off Crimea that way possible? Most analysts have said no, but Russia wont be expecting it and as far as I can tell they only have light infantry garrisons that would be decimated by a western armoured force. This looks very similar to the Kharkiv offensive - put all the eyes on a grand southern offensive, keep the east side of Dnipier lightly garrisoned as Russia pulls troops to the South, and when nobody expects it cross the Dnipier with armoured forces and cut off Crimea. Only difference (albeit big difference) between Kharkiv offensive being a huge river in the way - so does Ukraine have the amphibious ability to do this?
