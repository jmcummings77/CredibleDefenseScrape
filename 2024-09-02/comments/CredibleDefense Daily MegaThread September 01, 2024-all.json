At the beginning they mention his next trip is to Poland to report on how the Polish military is training UAF troops.  \n\nHe also put out a second article giving details from the exercise.  I really recommend the full article.  I've cut out a lot of details but the best takeaway is they are testing out the latest tech and it can give a wide range of new capabilities, but if the humans operating the tech are making mistakes opposition forces can still create and use opportunities to strike and cause damage.\n\n[Old-school soldiers prove they can still beat tech-heavy troops | Defense One | August 2024](https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/08/old-school-soldiers-prove-they-can-still-beat-tech-heavy-troops/399087/?oref=d1-homepage-river)\n\n*Deep in the Louisiana woods, the U.S. Army's \u201cGhost\u201d unit showed that doing the basics well can still turn the tide.*\n\n*But even as warfare in Ukraine suggests a major shift in land operations, an old lesson appeared to hold true: a well-led, experienced force fighting on its home turf can still win against a technologically superior enemy. Over the course of a dusk-to-dawn raid earlier this month, Defense One watched as Spirko and other members of Geronimo's \u201cGhost\u201d reconnaissance unit outfoxed Strike time after time.*\n\n*Tonight\u2019s objective: find the 101st\u2019s Multi-Functional Reconnaissance Company (MFRC). The unit was a formidable adversary. One of only three similar units across the Army, the MFRC was decked out with new gear perfect for hunting the adversary, including drones, electronic warfare tools, deception equipment, and more. If Geronimo could find them, they\u2019d weaken Strike\u2019s reconnaissance capability and take a powerful unit off the board.*\n\n*Racing out on the three dune-buggy type vehicles, day turned into night, forcing the soldiers to rely on night-vision goggles to drive. Nevertheless, the soldiers were able to move quickly, assisted by their deep knowledge of the roads.*\n\n*After winding their way through the woods, the teams converged on a small clearing to release a drone. On board the drone, a Raspberry Pi computer was set up to scan the nearby forest for the tell-tale electronic signals given off by WiFi devices.*\n\n*But the TS-M800 had technical problems, forcing the soldiers to wait. In the darkness came the rumbling of vehicles. A soldier glanced at an Android phone loaded with the Tactical Assault Kit software, and identified them as Baker Company.*\n\n*The soldiers parked near the objective and got out of the vehicle. Spirko\u2019s steps barely made a sound, despite the many branches underfoot. Soon, they encountered the small outpost\u2014where Spirko \u201ckilled\u201d the three soldiers rushing toward them.*\n\n*On the road back to their vehicle, the two soldiers spotted four 101st Airborne ISVs parked just a few feet off the road, with two soldiers standing just behind them. The soldiers, perhaps tired from their day, did not challenge the two figures as they passed by. Spirko radioed back to base to report the soldiers, relaying their exact position for a possible strike without even looking at a map.*\n\n*Spirko and Adrade then hid their vehicle. Unlike the soldiers they\u2019d just spotted, they parked deep within the forest\u2014though not so deep that they couldn\u2019t watch the road. Peering out, they watched as oblivious 101st ISVs drove back and forth.*\n\n*Elsewhere, Corely\u2019s team was also making progress. He had found the position of a 101st company command post, and radioed the location back to base. Geronimo then used its indirect fires\u2014the term for everything from artillery to rockets\u2014to destroy the company base by virtually shelling it. The attack allowed Pathfinder Company, another Geronimo unit, to press forward and take back territory from the 101st.*\n\n*But Corely\u2019s work was not even close to over. After a whispered meeting with Andrade and Spirko, he and his team traveled off into the approaching dawn to continue their mission for another 12 hours.*\n\n*For Spirko and Andrade, though, it was time to drive back to the base to rest and reset. Drenched in sweat from the night\u2019s events, the air-conditioning felt almost painfully cold. They hadn't caught the MFRC\u2014but \u201cGhost\u201d unit had once again slipped through the enemy\u2019s hands.*",

He even had to fire his own defense minister for parroting Russia\u2019s spin on the war. In public, at least, Petkov sought to play down any idea that Bulgaria \u2014 despite considerable stocks of Soviet-era weaponry \u2014 would step up and arm Ukraine.*\n\n*While the Socialist Party in Sofia called Bulgarian arms deliveries to Ukrainian forces a \u201cred line,\u201d Petkov\u2019s officials avoided government-to-government transactions and used intermediary companies in Bulgaria and abroad to open up supply routes by air and land through Romania, Hungary, and Poland.*\n\n*With the secret supply lines to Ukraine, Petkov was taking a big risk.*\n\n*Polls in Bulgaria showed that 70 percent of citizens worried about being drawn into the war and therefore opposed too much support for Ukraine. President Rumen Radev, a nominee of the Socialist Party, stoked this sentiment, claiming that Bulgaria would become a party to the war if arms were supplied.*\n\n*It did not escape the Kremlin\u2019s attention that Bulgaria, under Petkov and Vassilev, was making massive efforts on behalf of Ukraine.*\n\n*Starting as early as May, Moscow bombarded his country with cyberattacks, Petkov said. These hit the power supply and post offices, and at times pensions for civil servants could not be paid.*\n\n*Moscow knew Bulgaria was the EU country most dependent on Russian gas before the war and decided to make an example of it.*\n\n*As early as April 27, Gazprom chose Bulgaria as the first EU country where it would sever gas exports. But Sofia did not relent. Within 24 hours, Prime Minister Petkov presented a solution that would allow Bulgaria\u2019s nearly 7 million inhabitants to get by without gas from Russia. He organized two tankers of liquefied natural gas from the United States \u2014 at the same price per cubic meter as Gazprom was charging.*\n\n*Petkov\u2019s government was toppled in a parliamentary vote of no confidence over the summer. Pro-Russian forces also played their part in that. By the fall, Petkov and Vassilev were only in office on a provisional basis. Since then, the country has been caught in political deadlock, but the attitude toward Ukraine has changed somewhat.*\n\n*In December, parliament decided to officially allow arms deliveries to Ukraine. \u201cWe are deeply grateful to Bulgaria for that,\u201d Kuleba said. However, he noted he was already seeing attempts to torpedo that decision. \u201cIt is unbelievable how persistently these forces are trying to pull Bulgaria to the side of the aggressor and butcher.\u201d*",

Sikorski argues that Poland's obligation to protect its citizens trumps NATO's concerns about becoming involved in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Poland has already signed a security agreement with Ukraine to explore the feasibility of intercepting missiles over Ukrainian territory. Despite NATO's reluctance, Sikorski insists on Poland's right to defend itself, especially after incidents involving Russian drones and missiles straying into Polish airspace. NATO officials, including Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, have warned that such actions could escalate the conflict and provoke Russian retaliation. However, Sikorski and Ukrainian officials believe that NATO's stance might evolve as the war continues, with Ukraine pushing for greater Western involvement in air defense.\n\n  \nSikorski's comments highlight a growing tension within NATO regarding the balance between individual member states' rights to self-defense and the alliance's collective strategy. Poland's assertive stance on intercepting missiles reflects its proximity to the conflict and the perceived immediacy of the threat from Russia. Could this lead to internal divisions within NATO if other member states feel that such actions could escalate the conflict?\n\nPoland's role as a frontline state bordering Ukraine puts it in a particularly vulnerable position. Sikorski's insistence on proactive defense measures underscores Poland's anxiety about potential spillover effects from the war in Ukraine. The bilateral security agreement with Ukraine suggests that Poland is willing to take more direct actions to secure its airspace, even at the risk of straining relations with NATO.\n\nNATO's leadership, represented by Jens Stoltenberg and Mircea Geoan\u0103, remains cautious about any actions that could draw the alliance directly into the conflict. The emphasis on avoiding escalation reflects NATO's strategic priority of preventing the war from spreading beyond Ukraine's borders. This caution contrasts with Poland's more proactive stance, suggesting differing threat perceptions among NATO members.\n\nSikorski's comments about European contributions to international security also point to concerns about US domestic politics, particularly in the context of the upcoming presidential election. European leaders are aware that sustaining US support for Ukraine may require convincing the American public and politicians that Europe is sharing the burden.",

There needs to be one last push that will result in dismantling Hamas for good and killing its leadership. If hostages can be freed then be it if not then at least the war will be over. \n\nBut coincidentally Hamas and Netanyahu seem to be interested in extending the war forever. One side thinks Israel will get pressured into a stalemate and clutches at any international changes to do that e..g the latest one was a general trend towards a reduction in the Israeli offensive because of the US elections.

I can\u2019t see both goals being achieved at the same time short of deploying 100,000s of Israeli soldiers continuously in Gaza while administering the population. There needs to be one last push that will result in dismantling Hamas for good and killing its leadership. If hostages can be freed then be it if not then at least the war will be over. </p>\n\n<p>But coincidentally Hamas and Netanyahu seem to be interested in extending the war forever. One side thinks Israel will get pressured into a stalemate and clutches at any international changes to do that e..g the latest one was a general trend towards a reduction in the Israeli offensive because of the US elections. Netanyahu on the other hand has been derailing any Israeli official enquires into the war itself and what caused which will mean the end of his political career for good (and that of the Netanyahu dynasty as well).</p>\n</div>",
