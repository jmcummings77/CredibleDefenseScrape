During his speech at the Cipher Brief 2024 defense and economy forum in Kyiv, he urged the government to transition to long-term contracts, as it's the key incentive for manufacturers to invest in ramping up their capacity.*\n\n*\"Any private manufacturer is ready to increase production volumes in case it's awarded a planned long-term order. Then, it won't need investments from the state or sponsors, the manufacturer will be able to make plans, involve and invest, develop products and increase the volumes of weapons and equipment produced at its own expense.\"*\n\n*Against the backdrop of rapidly developing FPV drone manufacture, with Ukraine's government heavily investing in this sphere in 2024, he added:*\n\n*\"In my opinion, FPV drones are like 'new powder' for the war but we shouldn't forget about conventional weapons either, such as artillery. We have to prioritize domestic production, develop it in significant quantities in order to have a balance of capabilities on the frontline, including the artillery [capability],\" said Belbas at the forum, as quoted by his company's press service.*\n\n*Also, the head of Ukrainian Armor revealed a problem he faced when talking to international partners: foreign investors are not willing to take extra risk injecting their money into Ukrainian defense industry because important data about defense facilities is still available in the public domain, and Russians could use this information to target industrial facilities.*\n\n*\"Engagement of external partners will be possible only after Ukraine has an understandable and transparent system of work, and the manufacturers' assets are protected. It is unacceptable that on the third year of war that public sources have information about the contractors fulfilling defense orders, their locations, volumes of implementation, etc. On the third year of war, this information should be classified and hidden from the enemy,\" Belbas insisted.*\n\n*On the part of Defense Express, the issue with the openly available data of defense contractors has been discussed for a few months now, in particular, NAUDI \u2014 the National Association of Ukrainian Defense Industries \u2014 in February 2024 submitted an appeal to the Prime Minister of Ukraine, Denys Shyhal, to classify the said information.*",

We have to prioritize domestic production, develop it in significant quantities in order to have a balance of capabilities on the frontline, including the artillery [capability],&quot; said Belbas at the forum, as quoted by his company&#39;s press service.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Also, the head of Ukrainian Armor revealed a problem he faced when talking to international partners: foreign investors are not willing to take extra risk injecting their money into Ukrainian defense industry because important data about defense facilities is still available in the public domain, and Russians could use this information to target industrial facilities.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>&quot;Engagement of external partners will be possible only after Ukraine has an understandable and transparent system of work, and the manufacturers&#39; assets are protected. It is unacceptable that on the third year of war that public sources have information about the contractors fulfilling defense orders, their locations, volumes of implementation, etc. On the third year of war, this information should be classified and hidden from the enemy,&quot; Belbas insisted.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>On the part of Defense Express, the issue with the openly available data of defense contractors has been discussed for a few months now, in particular, NAUDI \u2014 the National Association of Ukrainian Defense Industries \u2014 in February 2024 submitted an appeal to the Prime Minister of Ukraine, Denys Shyhal, to classify the said information.</em></p>\n</div>",

Firstly, the Defense Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense responded to ArmyInform\u2019s inquiry, revealing that Russia possesses over 100 Su-34 aircraft alongside roughly 100 Su-35 fighters and only four A-50U radar surveillance aircraft currently active.*\n\n*Secondly, Russian sources reported that Novosibirsk\u2019s aircraft factory has dispatched the initial batch of new Su-34 aircraft for Russian tactical aviation in 2024. This development prompts questions about Russia\u2019s production rate for Su-34 aircraft, drawing attention to contrasting assessments from Western sources.*\n\n*At the start of 2024, Defence24 suggested that Russia\u2019s Su-34M production decreased from 10 in 2022 to just six in the past year. In February 2024, the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) stated that Russia produced \u201cno fewer than six\u201d Su-34 aircraft last year.

The swing-wing jet, nicknamed Lancelot, will replace another aircraft that was written off after a catastrophic engine fire during routine maintenance at Dyess Air Force Base, Texas, in 2022, an incident you can read all about [here](https://www.twz.com/b-1-bombers-engine-burst-into-flames-at-dyess-air-force-base).*\n\n*The Air Force recently confirmed that B-1B Lancelot, which has the serial number 85-0081, has arrived at Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma, where it will undergo the regeneration process before rejoining the Air Force fleet.*\n\n*Originally built as the 41st production Lancer, part of the Lot 4 production batch, 85-0081 was previously nicknamed Equalizer and Aftershock, and was involved in a nose gear collapse at Diego Garcia in December 2004. This caused the B-1 fleet to be grounded pending inspection of the nose landing gear.*\n\n*After returning to service and spending years flying around the globe, the aircraft was delivered to the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG) at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona, for long-term storage in March 2021. Lancelot had been decommissioned as part of the divestiture of 17 B-1s, in line with a February 2020 Air Force decision to cut down the then 62-strong Lancer fleet. Congressional approval for that move then came under the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2021.*\n\n*Of the 17 retired aircraft, 13 went to AMARG, of which four \u2014 including 85-0081 \u2014 were retained in Type 2000 (reclaimable) storage.*\n\n*As we have explained in the past, Type 2000 involves the aircraft being maintained in a way that makes it easier to return them to service should that be necessary, especially due to any potential future combat losses or accidents.*\n\n*The other nine B-1s at AMARG were permanently retired in Type 4000 storage. The other four were assigned for ground training/testing or for preservation in museums.*\n\n*The decision to remove Lancelot from AMARG was made by the Air Force\u2019s Strategic Plans and Programs office, as a replacement for the B-1 that caught fire at Dyess in the flight-line incident on April 20, 2022, when it was aircraft receiving routine engine maintenance.*\n\n*Consideration had been given to repairing the fire-damaged aircraft but ultimately it was deemed cheaper to return Lancelot to service, to ensure the B-1 fleet meets its congressionally mandated size and maintains its operational readiness. When the incident occurred at Dyess, the B-1 fleet numbered 45 aircraft, but since then another example has been written off. This was the aircraft that crashed at Ellsworth Air Force Base, South Dakota, on January 4 this year, as we reported on at the time.*\n\n*It is not clear if there are plans for another B-1 to be taken out of storage to make up that loss.*\n\nThe article continues on for awhile.  I recommend the whole thing if you're interested in the B1, the boneyard, or aircraft restoration.  \n\nIf you're wondering why bring a B1 back at all.

They don't care about their own country, much less another one. Zelensky's communicating the stakes for Ukraine, and by extension the US, if US aid doesn't come. It's a rational appeal that tries to convince Congress that America is about to lose, just like Ukraine. I don't think that appeal is capable of swaying Congress not because they don't care if Ukraine wins or loses, but because I don't think they care if *America* wins or loses.\n\n\nIf you want evidence, just consider that Johnson could easily ram this through if Democrats backed him as speaker in the inevitable leadership challenge raised by that one idiot from Georgia.

However, we've yet to see a drone counter. I would believe that a drone counter would be nearly as cheap and highly effective - at least when compared to a 24M$ US tank.

Rep McCaul noted that it&#39;s hard to sell more funding for Ukraine when Biden still refuses their requests for ATACMS. 93/109</p>\n\n<p>There may be a light at the end of the tunnel though. Johnson has said that the House will take up votes on foreign aid &quot;immediately&quot; once they return from recess on April 9. How that exactly plays out remains to be seen though. 94/109</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note how he addresses Johnson in one line, says Congress should have passed it - absolving Johnson and House Republicans of their responsibility for holding it up - and then goes back to say that it is Biden&#39;s fault for not using the right tactics to get Johnson to pass it. Then ends that Johnson is the light at the end of the tunnel. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m always torn on Colby because he has a wealth of information, but pretends to be &quot;objective&quot; when he isn&#39;t.</p>\n</div>",

Assad massacred almost a million of his own citizens and all the moderate Arab states have started to mend relations with him.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is weirdly dismissive of what\u2019s occurred and is ignoring the massive shift in regional opinion on Palestine. There\u2019s no way forward with broader Arab normalization without some resolution on the issue. I see this notion a lot but it flies in the face of what most people educated on Arab nations have said about the wars impact.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Other than Israel&#39;s reputation being tatters, I don&#39;t see any long-term consequences of this war besides making the international community recognize they cannot ignore the Palestinian issue. That said, Gaza is obliterated and Israel is profoundly destabilized. I don&#39;t think it is going to be even possible to theorize a resolution until long after the dust settles.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "Rostec director Bekhan Ozdoev presents their list of company's achievements in 2023. Obviously, besides the usual grain of salt, it is important to note that he speaks in relative terms - it is easy(ish) to increase your SPG production ten times if you produced four SPGs the year before.\n\nWhat I find interesting is the relatively low growth in production and repair of tank/artillery barrels - just two times.\n\nThe switch to the production of gunpowder out of wood and pulp (instead of cotton) also looks interesting. They are going domestic as much as they can.\n\n- Rostec reached production rates and volumes that \u201conly recently seemed unrealistic.\u201d\n\n- Compared to 2022, the production volume of self-propelled artillery increased 10 times, towed artillery - 14 times. Mortars - 20 times, MLRS - 2 times.\n- The production and repair of tank guns and artillery barrels has doubled.\n\n- Last year, the development of several new systems was completed: the Malva wheeled howitzer, the Drok self-propelled 82-mm mortar, and the 57-mm Derivation-Air Defense complex.\n\n- A new heavy flamethrower system TOS-3 with a longer range is in development. The first prototype has already been created.\n\n- In 2023, Rostec supplied 25 times more ammunition than the year before. The production of the entire line of weapons has increased. For certain items, supplies have been increased up to 50 times.\n\n- The production of shots for automatic and grenade launchers has been increased fivefold.\n\n- The production of guided artillery shells, including Krasnopol-M2, has increased manifold in 2023. This year the output will also be increased.\n\n- Rostec's ammunition factories are at 100% capacity and work 24/7. This year we plan to further increase the production of weapons and expand production capacity.\n\n- Industrial production of gunpowder from alternative types of raw materials - wood and flax pulp - began. In the future, the share of new raw materials in the production of gunpowder will reach 60\u201370%.\n\n- Rostec is creating means to combat small-sized drones, including attack FPV drones. It is a small-caliber shot with a multi-element projectile and a remote-controlled fuse. The design of this product contains striking elements, which, after the command detonation of a projectile, create a field of striking elements directed towards the UAV.\n\n- To protect aircraft, helicopters and ground equipment from high-precision weapons, Rostec enterprises supply the troops with more than 20 types of jamming cartridges of various calibers.\n\nhttps://rostec . ru/news/bekkhan-ozdoev-segodnya-zavody-rostekha-po-izgotovleniyu-boepripasov-zagruzheny-na-100-/",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Rostec director Bekhan Ozdoev presents their list of company&#39;s achievements in 2023. Obviously, besides the usual grain of salt, it is important to note that he speaks in relative terms - it is easy(ish) to increase your SPG production ten times if you produced four SPGs the year before.</p>\n\n<p>What I find interesting is the relatively low growth in production and repair of tank/artillery barrels - just two times.</p>\n\n<p>The switch to the production of gunpowder out of wood and pulp (instead of cotton) also looks interesting. They are going domestic as much as they can.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Rostec reached production rates and volumes that \u201conly recently seemed unrealistic.\u201d</p></li>\n<li><p>Compared to 2022, the production volume of self-propelled artillery increased 10 times, towed artillery - 14 times. Mortars - 20 times, MLRS - 2 times.</p></li>\n<li><p>The production and repair of tank guns and artillery barrels has doubled.</p></li>\n<li><p>Last year, the development of several new systems was completed: the Malva wheeled howitzer, the Drok self-propelled 82-mm mortar, and the 57-mm Derivation-Air Defense complex.</p></li>\n<li><p>A new heavy flamethrower system TOS-3 with a longer range is in development. The first prototype has already been created.</p></li>\n<li><p>In 2023, Rostec supplied 25 times more ammunition than the year before. The production of the entire line of weapons has increased.
