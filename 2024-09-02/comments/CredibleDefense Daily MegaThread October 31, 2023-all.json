        "body": "This morning the Ukrainian military observer Mashovets published the most recent estimate (by Ukrainian military intelligence) of the Russian grouping deployed in Ukraine. I will also include the latest estimates for a comparison as well the one from April.\n\n\n\nTime period | Personnel | MBTs | AFVs | Artillery guns \u2265 100mm | MLRS\n:-------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:---------:\nLate April 2023 | 396'000 | 1'764 | 4'289  |  2'994 | 870\nEarly September 2023 | 420'000 | 2'260 | 5'260 | 3'050 | 920\nEarly October 2023 | 429'000 | 2'347 | 5'653 | 3'186 | 974\nLate October 2023 | 441'700 | 2'324 | 5'661 | 3'148 | 982\n\n\n\nI find likely that among the artillery guns, 120mm mortars are included in the estimate. To this we must add 46 operational-tactical missile launchers. This grouping is organized into 60 separate brigades (of each type), 137 regiments, 106 separate battalions and 46 detachments (BARS, Storm Z, Akhmat). In the waters of the Black Sea, the Sea of Azov, the Mediterranean and the Caspian Sea, the Russian Navy would have 116 ships and 4 submarines, of which 22 and 3, respectively, are capable of carrying out missile attacks. The air grouping (of the Air Force and of the Naval Aviation) concentrated for operations in Ukraine would have 322 combat, special and military transport aircrafts and 289 helicopters, including 123 attack helicopters (I assume largely Mil Mi-24 and Mi-28s, due to losses of Ka-52s).\n\nI had commented on the estimate of early October [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/174jepj/comment/k4a4p1i/). As we see, manpower continues to grow (in large part due to the influx of new contract soldiers from poorer regions), but in October it looks like there has been an halt to the upward trend in equipment, I imagine largely due to losses around Avdiivka. This is a reversal of the trend which has to be noted, as it occurred despite the arrival (during the first half of the month) in the Kupyansk sector of the newly formed 153rd Tank Regiment (47th Tank Division, 1st GTA, WMD), which has 94 tanks according to Ukrainian military intelligence (as far as I have been able to find, they should be T-72B3M Obr. 2022 and T-72B Obr. 1985), 32 unspecified IFVs and 12 D-30 122mm howitzers. New formations of the 18th and 25th Armies are also continuing to be deployed along the front: the newly formed 144th Motorized Brigade (40th Corps, 18th Army, SMD) was reportedly recently deployed along the Dnipro in Kherson Oblast. \n\nIn the estimate of September, the intelligence had added that among the tanks deployed, T-55s and T-62s made up between 15 and 20% of the total. These two tanks have different uses: the former are generally T-55As, without any additional protection except for anti-drone cages and they seem to be assigned to regiments of the Territorial Forces (those of the 1***th series) as fire support vehicles; the T-62M(V)s are in somewhat better conditions (e.g. they have reactive armor) in order to be used as \"normal\" tanks, and are assigned to \"regular\" units: we have evidence that a portion of the nearly 100 tanks the 5th Tank Brigade (36th Army, EMD) fields are T-62Ms, as are those of the 138th Motorized Brigade (6th Army, WMD), and they also appear to have been issued to the new formations, such as to units of the 70th Motorized Division (18th Army, SMD) deployed in Kherson Oblast during August. Also, despite the fact that on paper there should still be many BMP-1s in storage, from Russian losses we see a growing number of MT-LBs being used for offensive purposes (often modified with more powerful weapons), and the Russian Telegram channel \"Military Informant\" reported a few weeks ago that many BTR-70s are being pulled out of storage and assigned to new units undergoing training. \n\nP.S.: Rosgvardia is not considered in the estimates as it's deployed in the rear. The latter is forming new units too, such as the 116th Special Purpose Brigade, which will be the first unit of the branch to receive a tank company (apparently, T-80BVs seized from the Wagner Group). There are also rumors that Rosgvardia may establish new units led by former Wagner commanders that could enclose former members of this PMC willing to sign a contract and return  to combat - in a framework that seeks to give these units some autonomy and retain some the PMC's former structure. Kadyrov had stated that 170 former Wagnerites signed contracts with Akhmat units (which are embedded in the Ground Forces, they are not to be confused with the Kadyrovites of the National Guard), although channels linked to the Wagner Group reportedly denied this. There's bad blood between Wagner Group and Kadyrov - Grey Zone in the past has accused the Kadyrovites of cowardice and of staying safely in the rear, unlike the Akhmat units created during 2022, which are formed by volunteers from all over Russia (although mostly from the wider Northern Caucasus), are financed by the Chechen Government, are trained in the \"special forces\" training center in Gudermes (near Grozny) and are led usually by Chechen officers.",

These two tanks have different uses: the former are generally T-55As, without any additional protection except for anti-drone cages and they seem to be assigned to regiments of the Territorial Forces (those of the 1***th series) as fire support vehicles; the T-62M(V)s are in somewhat better conditions (e.g. they have reactive armor) in order to be used as &quot;normal&quot; tanks, and are assigned to &quot;regular&quot; units: we have evidence that a portion of the nearly 100 tanks the 5th Tank Brigade (36th Army, EMD) fields are T-62Ms, as are those of the 138th Motorized Brigade (6th Army, WMD), and they also appear to have been issued to the new formations, such as to units of the 70th Motorized Division (18th Army, SMD) deployed in Kherson Oblast during August. Also, despite the fact that on paper there should still be many BMP-1s in storage, from Russian losses we see a growing number of MT-LBs being used for offensive purposes (often modified with more powerful weapons), and the Russian Telegram channel &quot;Military Informant&quot; reported a few weeks ago that many BTR-70s are being pulled out of storage and assigned to new units undergoing training. </p>\n\n<p>P.S.: Rosgvardia is not considered in the estimates as it&#39;s deployed in the rear. The latter is forming new units too, such as the 116th Special Purpose Brigade, which will be the first unit of the branch to receive a tank company (apparently, T-80BVs seized from the Wagner Group). There are also rumors that Rosgvardia may establish new units led by former Wagner commanders that could enclose former members of this PMC willing to sign a contract and return  to combat - in a framework that seeks to give these units some autonomy and retain some the PMC&#39;s former structure. Kadyrov had stated that 170 former Wagnerites signed contracts with Akhmat units (which are embedded in the Ground Forces, they are not to be confused with the Kadyrovites of the National Guard), although channels linked to the Wagner Group reportedly denied this. There&#39;s bad blood between Wagner Group and Kadyrov - Grey Zone in the past has accused the Kadyrovites of cowardice and of staying safely in the rear, unlike the Akhmat units created during 2022, which are formed by volunteers from all over Russia (although mostly from the wider Northern Caucasus), are financed by the Chechen Government, are trained in the &quot;special forces&quot; training center in Gudermes (near Grozny) and are led usually by Chechen officers.</p>\n</div>",

Like Bakhmut at the time, we don't know how this will affect future plans, or how much it affected both armies.

We don't know the state of the \"NATO brigades\", though I think there's evidence they aren't attrited as much as some think. The 47th Mech, for instance, is now in Avdiivka rather than in a rear area or a quiet part of the line. We still haven't seen the Abrams in combat. We haven't seen any more Challenger losses, so I'm inclined to think the 82nd isnt particularly attrited either. AFU is still making the occasional positional advance, most recently west of Robotyne, but this is inconsequential. Mainly it shows that they'll be able to keep their gains and maintain this salient in the short and medium term, which may make a future offensive easier to manage.\n\nAll that to say, I think we'll know in six months how badly AFU failed, and how much it messed up the Russians. If AFU can take its licking and make major changes to its command philosophy and operational and tactical planning, I think they still have the potential to accomplish their strategic objectives.

The general public and even a lot of the \"credible\" types harped on about Russia being in a doom spiral for the better part of nearly the last two years. Some of the people even lauded in military circles were coming out with takes so far outside of reasonable or measured that it was hard to see their credibility through the extreme bias and frankly naivety they were expressing.\r  \n\r  \nI'm not blind to Russia's failings, there are many and militarily it's a bit of a mixed bag dumpster fire, but it's clear to me that these people were either extremely na\u00efve or deliberately blind to Russia's successes and continually growing capabilities.\r  \n\r  \nThe quirky little tank trackers showing the day when Russia would \"run out\" of tanks, posts about Russia putting on cope cages and ERA armour on their tanks. Analysts predicting the economic collapse of Russia from the word go, despite their economy and more importantly their military production exceeding pre-war capacity and continually growing despite sanctions. Then you've got people parroting Ukraine's numbers on casualties and enemy combatants killed, without recognizing that their own claimed casualties were equally as non credible as Russia's etc. You've got all of the OSINT accounts and western military analysts hyping up this grand counter offensive and then seemingly either now going radio silent or folding themselves twelve times trying to explain how it wasn't really Ukraine's fault that their counter offensive achieved nothing and that they knew all along that Russia's defenses were too strong (despite crowing loudly about how Russia had lost too many troops and millions had skipped the mobilization draft).\r  \n\r  \nAll of this tribalism and wilful blindness has contributed to this very dangerous and foolish idea that somehow Russia was an already beaten animal, which it absolutely was not... Which has now come home to roost with the Ukrainian counter offensive achieving extremely little and a renewed Russian offensive in Avdiivka and Kupyansk.\r  \n\r  \nJust from a purely logistical standpoint, many western military analysts were joking about Russia \"scraping the bottom of the barrel\" with North Korean artillery ammunition shipments. Like sure, valid criticism, but we didn't hear a peep from them about the complete failure of the west to even hit their previously revised and reduced target of artillery production after nearly two years of \"ramp up\".\r  \n\r  \nThey all parroted each other ad nauseum about Russia's extreme tank losses, which is true, but they then mentally discounted Russian refurbishment operations, which by and large seem to have replaced the tanks being lost at a reasonably impressive pace. Russian capabilities still greatly outnumber Ukrainian in a large number of strategically significant areas.\r  \n\r  \nI mean heck how many times has an ex-colonel, ex analyst, think tanker, gone on media parroting the political downfall of Russia? This dangerous thinking has led to a position in which the public are \\*weary\\* of not winning yet. This war has dragged on for nearly two years now with very little to show for it, it's not surprising that the general public are growing disinterested, they've been told repeatedly for nearly two years that Russia was on the brink of collapse...",

Some of the people even lauded in military circles were coming out with takes so far outside of reasonable or measured that it was hard to see their credibility through the extreme bias and frankly naivety they were expressing.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not blind to Russia&#39;s failings, there are many and militarily it&#39;s a bit of a mixed bag dumpster fire, but it&#39;s clear to me that these people were either extremely na\u00efve or deliberately blind to Russia&#39;s successes and continually growing capabilities.</p>\n\n<p>The quirky little tank trackers showing the day when Russia would &quot;run out&quot; of tanks, posts about Russia putting on cope cages and ERA armour on their tanks. Analysts predicting the economic collapse of Russia from the word go, despite their economy and more importantly their military production exceeding pre-war capacity and continually growing despite sanctions. Then you&#39;ve got people parroting Ukraine&#39;s numbers on casualties and enemy combatants killed, without recognizing that their own claimed casualties were equally as non credible as Russia&#39;s etc. You&#39;ve got all of the OSINT accounts and western military analysts hyping up this grand counter offensive and then seemingly either now going radio silent or folding themselves twelve times trying to explain how it wasn&#39;t really Ukraine&#39;s fault that their counter offensive achieved nothing and that they knew all along that Russia&#39;s defenses were too strong (despite crowing loudly about how Russia had lost too many troops and millions had skipped the mobilization draft).</p>\n\n<p>All of this tribalism and wilful blindness has contributed to this very dangerous and foolish idea that somehow Russia was an already beaten animal, which it absolutely was not... Which has now come home to roost with the Ukrainian counter offensive achieving extremely little and a renewed Russian offensive in Avdiivka and Kupyansk.</p>\n\n<p>Just from a purely logistical standpoint, many western military analysts were joking about Russia &quot;scraping the bottom of the barrel&quot; with North Korean artillery ammunition shipments. Like sure, valid criticism, but we didn&#39;t hear a peep from them about the complete failure of the west to even hit their previously revised and reduced target of artillery production after nearly two years of &quot;ramp up&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>They all parroted each other ad nauseum about Russia&#39;s extreme tank losses, which is true, but they then mentally discounted Russian refurbishment operations, which by and large seem to have replaced the tanks being lost at a reasonably impressive pace. Russian capabilities still greatly outnumber Ukrainian in a large number of strategically significant areas.</p>\n\n<p>I mean heck how many times has an ex-colonel, ex analyst, think tanker, gone on media parroting the political downfall of Russia? This dangerous thinking has led to a position in which the public are *weary* of not winning yet. This war has dragged on for nearly two years now with very little to show for it, it&#39;s not surprising that the general public are growing disinterested, they&#39;ve been told repeatedly for nearly two years that Russia was on the brink of collapse...</p>\n</div>",

He doesn't want to \"get jammed\" by those two into just accepting what is put in front of them because there are no other options and the House gets worn down. \n\nWhen initial comments about Israeli aid being split from Ukraine aid and border funding came out, I thought it was  a good strategy on his part. Split out the most popular part, pass it, and dare the Democrats to hold it up in the Senate. The leverage Ukraine aid for more border security funding or even policy changes. A small concession to fiscal constraint to win bigger concessions on other priorities. \n\nWhen it came out with the IRS cuts, it baffled me a little. Yes, his conference will like it, but unless he gets almost all of them onboard, it isn't going anywhere as Democrats won't vote for it; especially since in the debt ceiling deal they already gave up $10bn in IRS funding. Cutting another $14.6bn just isn't going to be palatable. Which leaves the House GOP with no bill, and open to jamming from the Senate and White House. \n\nThe debt ceiling deal is something else that plays in Johnson's favor. If there isn't the passage of the appropriation bills by January 1st, but only a continuing resolution, there is an automatic 1% cut below this year's approved levels (though it doesn't go into effect until April 30). That's an automatic win for the GOP who wants more cuts. While a blunt way method - much like sequestration - it still reduces spending. Since Johnson didn't negotiate said deal, if the House can't pass their appropriation bills and only goes for CRs, Johnson could get a relatively painless win. It could even be a viable strategy would be to hammer out another deal that keeps the same thing in effect for multiple years, perhaps with defense cap adjustments. That would effectively reduce the budget when accounting for inflation. \n\nI'll wait and see if the IRS rider was just something he needed to get it to the floor and gets stripped out, but if not, I don't see Johnson being an effective Speaker since he would fail at his most basic overall strategy.",

Cutting another $14.6bn just isn&#39;t going to be palatable. Which leaves the House GOP with no bill, and open to jamming from the Senate and White House. </p>\n\n<p>The debt ceiling deal is something else that plays in Johnson&#39;s favor. If there isn&#39;t the passage of the appropriation bills by January 1st, but only a continuing resolution, there is an automatic 1% cut below this year&#39;s approved levels (though it doesn&#39;t go into effect until April 30). That&#39;s an automatic win for the GOP who wants more cuts. While a blunt way method - much like sequestration - it still reduces spending. Since Johnson didn&#39;t negotiate said deal, if the House can&#39;t pass their appropriation bills and only goes for CRs, Johnson could get a relatively painless win. It could even be a viable strategy would be to hammer out another deal that keeps the same thing in effect for multiple years, perhaps with defense cap adjustments. That would effectively reduce the budget when accounting for inflation. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll wait and see if the IRS rider was just something he needed to get it to the floor and gets stripped out, but if not, I don&#39;t see Johnson being an effective Speaker since he would fail at his most basic overall strategy.</p>\n</div>",

A budget expert, he was then appointed as treasury secretary in 2013 and served in that post until 2017.\n\n>That appointment process was memorable for the criticism of his illegible loopy signature, as it would appear on American currency if he became secretary. He quickly adopted a more traditional sign-off.\nMr Lew began his career in politics in 1973. He worked for eight years as the primary domestic adviser to House Speaker Tip O'Neill, an iconic and powerful Democrat.\n\n>>Lew's view of Israel and Palestinians\n\n>*Mr Lew has previously spoken in support of a two-state solution. He openly criticised Israel and its conservative prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, while working under President Obama.*\n\n>*He also defended the US's 2016 decision not to veto the UN Security Council condemnation of Israeli settlements on occupied land.*\n\n>During his recent nomination hearing, however, Lew said he has \"worried deeply about the survival of the State of Israel\" throughout his life. Growing up, he said, his family believed deeply in the creation and defence of a Jewish homeland.\n\n>That background and Hamas's attack informed Mr Lew's view of the post's important responsibility, he said.\n\n>\"At this moment, there is no greater mission than to be asked to strengthen the ties between the United States and the State of Israel and to work toward peace in a region that has known so much war and destruction,\" he said in his opening statement to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\n>Mr Lew said that as ambassador he would work \"to end the horrific attacks by Hamas\" and make sure Israel has all \"it needs to defend itself\". He said he would strive to help American captives return home.\n\n>He also said he would do everything in his power to stop the conflict from expanding, aid innocent Palestinians trapped in Gaza, and stymie the influence of Iran, which he called \"a threat to regional stability and to Israel's existence\".\n\n>>The hearing and Republican opposition\n\n>Senate Democrats had stressed their desire to get Mr Lew into the ambassador's post, which was vacated in July, as quickly as possible.\nRepublicans, however, expressed reservations and in some cases hostility to the appointment.\n\n>Mr Lew sparred with Republicans during his hearing over his work on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, commonly known as the Iran Nuclear Deal.\n\n>The agreement, which included the UK, the US and several European countries, limited Tehran's nuclear programme. In return, Western countries and the UN agreed to eventually lift sanctions and unfreeze Iranian funds.\n\n>Jim Risch, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he had \"reservations\" over Mr Lew because of his involvement in the deal as President Obama's Treasury Secretary: \"Holding hands with Iran under the table doesn't work for me.\"\n\n>Republicans have long opposed the Iran Nuclear Deal, arguing it did not do enough to ensure Tehran would not develop a nuclear weapon and gave the government too much financial support. Donald Trump famously pulled the US out the agreement early in his administration.\n\n>Other Senate Republicans claimed the deal had allowed Iran to fund groups like Hamas. A few also suggested Mr Lew had misled Congress when testifying about the agreement as secretary.\n\n>Mr Lew disputed the claims, arguing that all Iran gained was access to \"their money that we had frozen\".

They do tend to be hamfisted. \n\nThat's why I said his claims shouldn't be dismissed out of hand.

People make mistakes, and that&#39;s fine.</p>\n\n<p>Elsewhere in the thread (the parent comment was about whether or not Ukraine&#39;s offensive, if you wanna look for it), someone said something along the lines of: few people expected Russia to faceplant the way they did early on, and that, coupled with Ukraine&#39;s success in Kharkiv and Kherson, influenced people&#39;s expectations for the counter-offensive. Or to put it in other words, this war has been (at times wildly) unpredictable from the get-go, so it makes sense that people got this or that wrong. I&#39;ve seen plenty of Western analysts, think-tankers, ex-military types get stuff wrong, and I don&#39;t mean the likes of Scott Ritter either, but people who actually know what they&#39;re talking about and aren&#39;t propagandists huffed up on hopium. It&#39;s okay for people to make mistakes, even though something that goes against your own beliefs may be annoying at the time.

Associated Press exit polls showed 64% of Muslims voted for Biden, a Democrat, and 35% for his Republican rival, Donald Trump.\n\n> The Arab American Institute estimates 3.7 million Americans \"trace their roots\" to an Arab country; its poll results\u00a0issued on Tuesday\u00a0show support for Biden and Democrats has dropped significantly in this group.\n\n> The White House has scrambled to address concerns raised by community members and political appointees within the administration. Biden met with a handful of Muslim leaders last Thursday, a White House official said.\n\n> White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre declined to comment on the poll, but told reporters that Biden was aware that American Muslims and those perceived to be Muslim had \"endured a disproportionate number ... of hate-fueled attacks\" and respected their perspectives.\n\n> She said the Biden administration had been engaging with Arab and Muslim community members, along with Jewish leaders, as well as political appointees within the administration on their different concerns, and would continue those efforts.\n\n> Biden has spoken out against rising antisemitism and Islamophobia, but Muslim leaders say the war must end.\n\n> Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) in Minnesota, said he had no option but to vote against Biden in 2024 unless he worked to end the fighting. He said he was speaking as an individual, not on behalf of CAIR, which is barred from political campaigning.\n\n> Local pro-Palestinian groups have scheduled a protest in Minneapolis on Wednesday during a visit by Biden to Minnesota to tout his administration's investments in rural America.\n\n> Arab and Muslim American communities\u00a0have voiced frustration that Biden has not condemned Israel's attacks on the Gaza Strip after an Oct. 7 attack by Palestinian Hamas militants from Gaza that Israel says killed 1,400 people and took 240 hostages.\n\n> Biden has said\u00a0Israel has a right to defend its citizens\u00a0but should protect innocent Palestinian civilians in Gaza who are victims of the conflict between Israel and Hamas.\n\n> Gaza health authorities say that 8,525 people, including 3,542 children, have been killed in Israeli attacks since Oct. 7. U.N. officials say more than 1.4 million of Gaza's civilian population of about 2.3 million have been made homeless.\n\n> Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u00a0said on Monday\u00a0he would not agree to any cessation of the attacks on Gaza. U.S. national security spokesman John Kirby said, \"Hamas is the only one that would gain from that right now.\"\n\n> Representative Rashida Tlaib, a Palestinian American lawmaker from Michigan, on Monday released a 90-second video on X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter, decrying Biden's support of what she called \"Israel's genocidal campaign in Palestine,\" adding \"Don't count on our vote in 2024.\"\n\nI doubt this will make Biden pressure Israel into a ceasefire, and I honestly don't see any way he wins from this. If he appeases the pro Palestine faction too much then he could lose the votes of pro Israel democrats and independents as well as fundraising money from them and also organizations like AIPAC. \n\nI also don't really see what they can reasonably do to punish Biden should he stay pro Israel. They can vote for a Republican candidate, but even Trump, who is considered more isolationist and less interventionist, is very pro Israel as he has showed when he was president. Unless the Republican candidate is completely neutral to Israel Palestine, this would be completely counter productive, although it could potentially prove a point, but at a big cost. They can have a pro Palestine candidate run against Biden in the primary, but they probably won't get far and might alienate the rest of the party, similar to the Freedom Caucus in the Republican party but without a super popular party figure like Trump in the GOP. They can also run a pro Palestine 3rd party candidate in the General Election but that would definitely piss off Democrats, especially if it causes Biden to lose. They can vote for the Greens since they're progressive and traditionally pro Palestine, but again, it would alienate the party. Lastly, they can boycott the election but again, that would have the same effect.",

It seems Iran's paramilitaries are acting rather independently rather than in synchronization.\n\nGoing back to that Hezbollah poll, taking it at face value, I think it may indicate something that goes against the Reddit assumption: Israel's protracted operations may not heavily increase anger at Israel and significantly increase support for Hamas. Rather, apathy towards the conflict will increase instead. Enough pro-Hamas informational operations have had time to kick in, yet the Lebanese public isn't rallying around a patriotic fervor to save their fellow Arab brethren in Gaza (aside from some demonstrations in Beirut).

I've brainstormed a few theories and scenarios of Ukraine's long term future based on some rough analysis from previous wars and to be honest in the short term they don't sound too good.\n\n1. The Syria or 'back to 2014 Donbas' ending:\n\nIn this scenario I'm assuming the US and Europe cut or drastically reduce aid meaning the AFU can no longer go on the offensive and decide to  dig in. But Ukraine also refuses to negotiate and cease and land therefore it goes back to a frozen conflict like we saw in the Donbas war of 2014 where there is little to no movement on either side with the occasional artillery barrage. And like  Syria having a destroyed war torn country and economy,  life in Ukraine will somehow find a way to survive.  Essentially a return to the decade long status quo.\n\n2) The Chechen ending:\n\nDespite Russia taking massive losses and fighting a long brutal war, in the end Russia emerged victorious and integrated Chechnya into the Russia federation. In this scenario the occupied territories in Ukraine are integrated into Russia with or without negotiations, Russia will rebuild the destroyed cities like they did Grozny and appoints pro Russian leaders in the oblasts. Ukraine and the West can make statements condemning it all they want but in the end the world moves on and the Ukraine war is another bloody chapter the regions history.\n\n3) The Finland/South Korea ending:\n\nDespite the memes in the Winter war of Simo Hayha and the USSR winning a phyric victory where they captured enough land to bury their dead, objectively the Finns did end up losing land. And despite all the memes of North Korea/China using human waves attacks and losing so many men North Korea is still intact to this very day.\n\nIn this scenario Ukraine still loses land like scenario 2 BUT this time the West still has Ukraine's back  and Ukraine successfully ends corruption (don't ask how, I haven't figured that out yet). Ukraine then rebuilds its war torn country with support from the West and rebuilds its army learning from all the mistakes of this war. And like South Korea 'West Ukraine' becomes much more wealthier (again not sure how this is going to happen) than 'East Ukraine' and like South Korea and Finland they adopt a similar military model since Finland is one of the very few European countries that took their defence and military spending seriously.  The current lines become Europe's version of the Korean DMZ and life moves on.\n\n4) Nagorno-Karabakh scenario:\n\nThis scenario is by far the most long term scenario I could think off.\n\nThe First Nagorno-Karabakh war lasted 6 years and ended in 1994 with Armenia taking Nagorno-Karabakh region. Azerbaijan only recently took it back this year.\n\nIn this scenario its continues on with scenario 3 but instead of staying defensive forever the AFU is willing to wait for decades to grow stronger both economically, influentially and militarily while trying to weaken Russia. Granted the scale in Ukraine is much larger and Russia isn't small, weak or isolated like Armenia. And honestly I will be shocked if anyone here will still be following this conflict into 2040-2050.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat are your thoughts  ? Do you have other scenarios in mind ?",

A limited operation is unlikely to change the status quo at all in the long run. Hamas is going to continuing attack Israel regardless of whether they were conciliatory or ruthless.

If we assume that all those new recruits are volunteers, is this a high or low number for volunteers during wartime?

As I said, the same functioned well enough with Israeli military administration for 30 years.\n\n>Gallant had repeatedly stated that Israel doesn\u2019t want to be responsible for civilian affairs\n\nSure, Israel doesn't want to occupy Gaza either. But if there are no other options. Others have expressed that Israel will likely be forces into occupying Gaza.\n\n>The Gaza that Israel occupied and the Gaza that will exist after the war are so far apart they might as well be on different planets\n\nThat's a meaningless word salad. The same has been said about the west Bank before operation defensive shield to recapture the Palestinian cities.\n\nUsers here projected 500 IDF KIA a day.\n\nThere is only one fundamental difference, the settlements in Gaza are gone and won't be rebuilt. Possibly there will be another difference, a much broader control area on the Egyptian border stopping tunnel smuggling.\n\n>If Israel occupies Gaza it is signing up to fight a decades long insurgency.
