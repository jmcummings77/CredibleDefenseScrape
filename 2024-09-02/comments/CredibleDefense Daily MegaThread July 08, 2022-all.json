        "body": "The Bundeswehr does a bit of publicity work on youtube and today they interviewed Oberst Dietmar Felber who is the leader of the artillery school where Ukrainian forces were/(are?) being trained on the pzh 2000. \n\n[Video in german](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4IJ6X7X8y0)\n\nA lot of the interview is covering \"common knowledge\" but there were a few interesting tidbits in there. \n\nHe contrasted German artillery coordination with Ukrainian by stating that Germany uses military hardware and military software communicating via radio, while the Ukraine uses consumer electronics (handys/laptops) communicating via the internet. According to him  Starlink and its resistance to jamming makes this viable. \n\nThe Ukrainian soldiers who went to be trained came from the front line, it was the first time he trained someone who already had experienced being on the receiving end of counter-battery fire.  \n\nThe pzh came with a lot of different ammunition (including smart) and the ballistics computer was updated to be capable to account for all Nato 155mm in ukraine (us, dutch, norwegian, german and french are mentioned)\n\nFor mars 2 he mentioned a range of 80km for the ammuntion which will be delivered. He also states that mars are much easier to operate than the pzh 2000. \n\nThe biggest difficulty in training was the alphabet. They are used to training non-german users, but the alphabet made it even more complicated. The ukrainian crews just took longer to parse information, so much of this had to be overcome with memorization.  \n\nThe Ukrainians had sent not only the crews, but also fire control and command personnel, and in the end he was very happy with their performance. \n\nLessons he took home from this expierence: In principle germany is training the right thing. Details will change. For example in the future smartphones will be left in the lockerroom at his school, smartphones are risky on the modern battlefield. (note from myself: which is quite curious when you combine it with fact that ukrainian artillery guidance relies on smartphones)\n\nThrough their now existing contacts to the ukrainian crews they were very happy to hear that the smart ammuntion is being used successfully and apparently a pzh also took counter-battery fire once, but the armor did its job and minimized the damage.",

These things wipe out command posts and ammo depots, but considering the cost of missiles are only $1 mill and with the accuracy we have been seeing I will not be surprised if this gets used to supplement normal artillery. Any vehicle that doesn't move for 30 minutes is a potential target. \n\nIf Russia is trying to fire 50,000 shots a day, I can imagine these things have plenty of not so mobile artillery pieces that they can start hitting. I imagine the main reason we haven't seen these things knock out things on tactical levels is because there's still so many high value targets lying around they're trying to rush to hit. But if 60 HIMARs are on there way? They would be hypothetically able to knock out 300 artillery pieces. I know that's not going to happen that easily, but if Russia is pouring massive equipment and artillery in, then there's going to be easy targets. I don't see how I'm wrong though so point out flaws if you can. I don't know if Russia has a cost effective way to destroy these systems either. They're out of range of the cheap firepower, and long range firepower is pretty expensive and Russia doesn't have a great history there. Air Force maybe? Those planes would be extremely vulnerable to have to go 40 KM into Ukrainian territory, where it's highly predicted when and where they would be.

            "body": "Russian artillery dominance in the Donbas in particular wasn't the cause for Ukraine losses, it was just how many deeper root causes manifested into an outcome that was quantifiable and visible. \n\nThe Ukrainians were very badly positioned in a small operational salient surrounded on three sides, on the ass end of a 1,250 kilometer supply line for everything coming from NATO or stored in western Ukraine, and were fighting from static positions. They refused to move S-300 closer to the battlefield and their limited number of MANPADS are now less effective. They're losing the drone ISR battle too, with theirs being jammed or shot down regularly. Most of their best troops are casualties at this point, forcing them to rely too much on barely trained troops, who are called cannon fodder for a reason. They lack sufficient command echelons at the tactical and operational level (one corps sized HQ controls scores of independent battalions and brigades). Most of their defensive positions are either rural trench lines or urban strongholds, both of which are typically targeted by heavy fires as a necessity to suppress, neutralize, or destroy them. And they decided at the strategic level to beat the Russians in an attritional static defensive campaign, which is like a boxer purposely trying to beat a BJJ black belt on the ground.\n\nFrom the Russian perspective, the Donbas campaign is characterized by their supply lines being incredibly short and secure, with rail stations only a dozen or so kilometers from the front lines, with massive ammo supply points (ASP) built all over their rear areas. Planning wise, everything they did was part of a highly planned set piece battle versus fluid maneuver that requires competence and initiative (aka Phase 1). They have localized air superiority, if not dominance. The area of operations is saturated with Russian drones that the UAF couldn't jam or shoot down in enough numbers, allowing every Russian tactical unit controlling the drones (and their artillery) to know real time where the Ukrainians are and what they're doing. They're using cautionary ground probing attacks, reconnaissance in force, to find UAF defensive positions. They are very low on infantry in particular and have to ration armored losses, so favoring a fires centric scheme that reinforces a preexisting fires centric doctrine, tradition, and obsession. \n\nAll of this points to Ukrainians very vulnerable to the most common means the Russians have to hurt them, artillery. \n\nBut again, Russian artillery is only so effective due to everything else. Which means the Ukrainians correct all the reasons the Russian artillery is so effective. Such as:\n\n- Keeping mobile as much as possible.\n- Dont spend months fighting in a deep salient or other bad positions \n- Fix their own logistics, especially since more and more of it will need to travel the entire length of Ukraine to get into the fight. \n- Move their ADA forward from the Dnieper even if it increases the risk of losing it. \n- Find a way to better counter Russian drones. \n- Use secure comms and superior intel in conjunction with a limited number of PGMs to conduct deep strikes to go after key targets that will have the biggest results: Russian command and control (who are critical due to their centralized directive command style), supply lines/ASP/rail stations, ADA radars, counterbattery radars, etc. \n\nAnd if all of this happens, HIMARS will likewise manifest itself as a quantifiable and very visible means of hurting Russia, but the real issue will be much bigger than HIMARS (or domestic Vilkha-M, which for some reason nobody talks about). What will make HIMARS tactically effective will be a mix of systematic Russian tactical, operational, and strategic problems along with Ukraine advantages that could themselves be undermined.",

Unless USA gives them 5000+ for this cause specifically.\n\nA good example is the Thanh H\u00f3a Bridge, one of America's biggest military failures in Vietnam. That's a tiny, shitty bridge as well over a small river.
