Russia did manage to make some early gains around Kreminna and Svatove, but it seems like they pulled forces out of those attacks to reinforce the attacks around Avdiivka/Bakhmut without much to show for it.

If the Javelin hits a part of the tank outside of where the crew/ammo/engine are, it probably punches a hole through it without blowing the tank up. These hits may still be mission kills depending on what components were hit (transmission, autoloader bits, etc.). \n\nIf it hits the front armor, the ERA + passive armor may have been enough to defeat the tandem warhead.\n\nIf it hits the turret or driver area without triggering an ammo cook-off, the jet (or at least spalling) likely kills or injures at least some of the crew and damages internal equipment like optics/controls/etc. that mission kill or functionally disable the tank.\n\nI've seen a good number of videos where a Javelin (or other HEAT ATGM) hits a tank, there's a little puff of smoke near the impact and the tank keeps rolling forward for a bit.

I probably should have mentioned pushing Ukraine back from Vuhledar so that they no longer had some degree of fire control over Russian logistical lines in the area. Russia achieved none of these. The lines near Kupyansk hardly changed. Kreminna is still under direct threat from Ukraine in the southern forest. Russia pushed a little westward on the northern side, but didn't even manage to threaten Torske. Bakhmut was pushed to the brink but appears stable now. Vuhledar is the graveyard of 'elite' mechanized units. And for some reason they ran into the buzzsaw that is Avdiivka's defensive ring despite not having any particular strategic value at this juncture.\n\nThey tried to push in too many areas. They began the offensive with superiority of numbers and equipment, so they tried a large scale attack at multiple points on the front. This diluted their potential effectiveness, making it easier for Ukraine to maintain a staggeringly large reserve for its coming counteroffensive.\n\nA successful offensive would've required them to send all the forces they applied to the aforementioned areas at one area. I'd have picked the Oskil front. Dislodge Ukraine from Bilhorivka, push them back to the Oskil, and call it a day. Wounds Ukrainian morale to see much of the gains erased from last autumn's Kharkiv offensive, provides a buffer for logistical routes through Svatove and Starobilsk, lets the Oskil act as a natural barrier against Ukrainian incursion, and gives them a chance to focus on other parts of the front in later offensives. \n\nThey got high on their own supply, and they got tens of thousands of men killed for no reason. Now it's Ukraine's turn to punch. And if they focus their offensive the way Russia should have, Russian lines will break.",

Wounds Ukrainian morale to see much of the gains erased from last autumn&#39;s Kharkiv offensive, provides a buffer for logistical routes through Svatove and Starobilsk, lets the Oskil act as a natural barrier against Ukrainian incursion, and gives them a chance to focus on other parts of the front in later offensives. </p>\n\n<p>They got high on their own supply, and they got tens of thousands of men killed for no reason. Now it&#39;s Ukraine&#39;s turn to punch. And if they focus their offensive the way Russia should have, Russian lines will break.</p>\n</div>",

If Russia concentrated its offensive to just one particular target, it's far more likely it would have been successful. Ironically, this is the same problem they had with their initial invasion plan too, where they invaded from 3 different directions on a dozen separate axies that prevented them from achieving their main objectives anywhere.

Vuhledar also would've been a good point to focus on, if nothing else than to disrupt Ukraine's expected offensive in that area. \n\nInstead they achieved nothing of note, but have suffered horrendous losses in the process.",

There was a lot of hype about this being Russia's big new 'offensive push' and it seems clear that a big part of that was an attempt to finally take Bakhmut. Being able to demonstrate that the Ukrainians are capable of denying Russia even that modest of a goal \n\nA few weeks ago, some of the chatter was more like \"maybe the Russians have actually founds some tactics that have let them regain the initiative in the war\", and now with their Bakhmut push stalling out it seems to be more like \"Russia's offensive is over, now we're just waiting to see what the Ukrainians can do when they launch their counter-offensive\".\n\nEven the \"Russia's eventually going to win\" crowd's argument has shifted from \"See!? If nothing else Russia can just overwhelm your defenses with an endless stream of men\" to \"Okay the Ukrainians have held, but maybe the loss ratio isn't as lopsided against the Russians as it was before.\"\n\nReally the 'proof' of whether or not the defense of Bakhmut was worth it depends on what kind of counter-attack Ukraine is going to be able to manage in the near future. If their counter-attack is successful, then the defense of Bakhmut didn't create a significant resource shortage, and maybe even was helpful because it kept significant Russian forces focused there instead of letting them establish more defenses elsewhere. \n\nIf the Ukrainian counter-offensive either doesn't actually materialize, or doesn't accomplish much, then we could potentially start to judge if the costs of defending Bahkmut limited them too much. \n\nBut even separate from that, I can see some logic in fighting in Bakhmut. The way the Russians have been continually pushing despite the huge losses seems to demonstrate that for political reasons, Putin really felt that Russia needed to see as much positive battlefield gains as they could over the past few months. That being the case, if the Ukrainians had retreated from Bakhmut, I think it's unlikely that the Russians would've been satisfied with that and ended their offensive push. They would've just taken that concentration of forces and moved it to another town and made a similar push. Basically if the Ukrainians decided not to continue to make a stand at Bakhmut, they just would've had to make a similar stand elsewhere. \n\nSo if you're going to have to have that kind of fight either way, why not stay in Bahkmut and make the Russians repeatedly bombard and assault a town that's already been destroyed, rather than fall back to another town that's still somewhat intact and then let the Russians start shelling there instead?",

I can't speak to why modern Russia has such a strong distate for the UK, but I can speak to why the Soviets disliked the British. Obviously, if you were a schoolkid in the 80s in the Soviet Union, you're now an adult in the Russian Federation--this is likely the work of childhood biases.\n\nFrom a Marxist perspective, the UK is the ur-capitalist state. They were the first to truly industrialize, and thus the first to truly spread out and conquer the world in a massive colonial and imperial adventure. All of India, half of Africa, countless islands and enclaves in every continent--the British were a big deal, to say the least. \n\nFor the early history of the Soviet Union (1917-1941), the British were the chief antagonists of the Soviet people. This was borne out in an actual invasion of Soviet territory during WW1 by Allied soldiers, and even after the British left, all of the USSR's leadership lived in fear of an imminent British-led intervention. This fear percolated down to the workers and peasants, and led to the veritable atmosphere of fear, which contributed to the awful excesses of the purges.\n\nThree events illustrate the mutual animosity the states felt against each other: the Baku air attack that wasn't, Molotov-Ribbentrop, and Operation Unthinkable. The first was a proposed 1940 attack to be led by British bombers to strike at Baku in the USSR, to deprive Germans of Soviet fuel resources (currently being traded to the Germans). It got postponed indefinitely thanks to the Fall of France, but you can see how such a planned attack would increase Soviet displeasure.\n\nThen there's the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. We tend to clown on Stalin nowadays for trusting to Hitler, but we should keep in mind it was the West that first trusted Hitler (Daladier and Chamberlain), allowing rearmament, Anchluss, and Munich to happen unabated. During the latter, the Allies ignored Soviet overtures of forming a collective security pact. Regardless of intentions, the Soviets perceived by August 1939 that the Allies were more than happy to let the Germans and Soviets kill each other in a bloody war, which would then allow them a few years later to swoop in and finish both off. See Glantz, Schrirer, et al for a full historical accounting.\n\nThen there's Operation Unthinkable: Churchill's plan to continue the war by turning the victorious allied war machine against the Soviets. Patton wasn't alone in thinking we ought to rearm SS and Panzer divisions for a go at the Soviets. The Soviets, who just fought a bloody war at the cost of 20 million lives to secure their continued existence.\n\nAfter the war, a lot of anti-British sentiment got folded into anti-American and anti-West sentiment thanks to the Cold War, which persisted even after 1991. A typical Russian analysis of the Iraq War might be \"Of course the British supported America in 2003, they are endless tools of American imperialism\". If in the way we conceive of Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea as forming an Axis of Evil, the Russians would consider America, the British, the French, and the Germans forming much of the same.\n\nBottom line: the average Russian has plenty of reasons to despise the British. At every turn since Brest-Litovsk, the British have mobilized the resources of their state to punish and beat down the Russians. \n\nThere's other reasons too: they don't trade a lot, aren't close geographically to each other, don't have a shared language or culture or even the same religion, Russian expats tend to flee to anglophile states, and more. But the roots, I think, we can find in Soviet historiography, as I've posited here.\n\nCan the circle be unbroken? I have no idea. That would require one side to admit they were at fault. Let's take WW1. The British believe they were fighting a just war against a brutal dictatorship and trying to defend their glorious empire against barbaric conquest from this brutal 'hunnic' invader. The Soviets believed that the whole war dumb, that the whole idea of having empires was criminal, that the best policy would be peace without annexation and an immediate cessation of hostilities. Obviously, both sides can't be right, and until they can reach a consensus on this first break of relations, it's hard to see any rapprochement in the works. Considering that the Empire is dead and 'peace without annexation' is pretty much the standard since WW2, I think there's some room for tactful diplomacy, here. Obviously, that's just one example, but it would be progress.",

People will disagree with me but India's insistence on claiming the whole disputed region and then Nehru enacting the Forward Policy as a resolution, was, to put it lightly, dumb as fuck. India and China have synergies which would have made them good partners as they share a similar world-view and have similar anti-colonial grievances, have large populations, natural resources, and want to industrialise. Furthermore, it would have more or less resolved the Pakistan issue for India as it would have had no major ally to lean on against India. Sure they would have faced problems in their great power competition but I think both would have fared better if they had resolved their disputes peacefully.\n\nChina also has had a long history of resolving its border disputes through negotiations, and those treaties have more or less held. They have also been generally generous for the other party. My reading is that Chinese border disputes are more about their worldview of not accepting a framework which emerged from the Century of Humiliation and correcting \"wrongs\" rather than an attempt at gaining territory for strategic advantage. Their insistence on Taiwan is similar. It is not due to Fabs or tech or anything, but to correct a \"historical wrong\" and end the government which was supported by the coloniser rather than taking over fabs.\n\nEdit: China to India",

India and China have synergies which would have made them good partners as they share a similar world-view and have similar anti-colonial grievances, have large populations, natural resources, and want to industrialise. Furthermore, it would have more or less resolved the Pakistan issue for India as it would have had no major ally to lean on against India. Sure they would have faced problems in their great power competition but I think both would have fared better if they had resolved their disputes peacefully.</p>\n\n<p>China also has had a long history of resolving its border disputes through negotiations, and those treaties have more or less held. They have also been generally generous for the other party. My reading is that Chinese border disputes are more about their worldview of not accepting a framework which emerged from the Century of Humiliation and correcting &quot;wrongs&quot; rather than an attempt at gaining territory for strategic advantage. Their insistence on Taiwan is similar. It is not due to Fabs or tech or anything, but to correct a &quot;historical wrong&quot; and end the government which was supported by the coloniser rather than taking over fabs.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: China to India</p>\n</div>",

But in the context of actual control it was offensive. Indian troops moved into Chinese controlled territory and came within 100m of Chinese troops who then retreated. As they moved \"forward\" again, China attacked and then declared a ceasefire. At that time China was in no position to get involved in a conflict as it was still reeling from the Great Famine and relations with USSR was also very cool.\n\n> Our tour guide had shit tons of opinions about it.

That dream is dead though. While the Buddhist argument applies in some places it does not in others which were completely uninhabited and only a part of India due to British maps and the Simla Convention, which to put it lightly was a clusterfuck.

He was also in Pakistan around the outset of the conflict as Pakistan was a channel for diplomatic outreach to China. It was short-lived though as relations were pretty low between LBJ and Ayub against the backdrop of the '65 war and then deteriorated again after Bhutto took control of the government in Pakistan with a very anti-American rhetoric.

The actual state of the relation notwithstanding, the US has always tried to woo India and forge a strategic partnership with India, only that India, under Nehru's Non-Aligned Movement, along with a general anti-colonial/imperialist sentiment turned away US overtures as it did not want to appear as a US lackey but as a Great Power.\n\nUS India relations predate the independence where Nehru was a popular and much admired figure in the US and the US pushed Britain for granting Indian independence as it viewed India as an important ally. Even Kennedy greatly admired India and wanted to forge a strategic partnership and so did LBJ against China post-62, again much to the chagrin of Pakistan which was a much more ready and willing ally, which had recently risked being bombed by the USSR for allowing U2 over flights.\n\n> Moreover, Pakistan was the intermediary that the US used to normalize relations with this \"expansionist communist power\" in the 1970s.\n\nYes again an engagement for limited strategic purposes which had no longlasting positive consequences for Pakistan. Relations deteriorated pretty fast afterwards. You have to understand that Pakistan was a front line state against communism and was ready to jump into any and every alliance structure to gain an ally against India which is much bigger in every sense. No matter what Pakistan did, the US refused to sacrifice potential relations with India for a security guarantee.\n\nEdit: added text in italics",
