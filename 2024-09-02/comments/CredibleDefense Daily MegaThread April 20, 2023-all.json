      "selftext": "The r/CredibleDefense daily megathread is for asking questions and posting submissions that would not fit the criteria of our post submissions. As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster. Don't abuse it though! If something is not obviously against the rules but you still feel that it should be reviewed, leave a short but descriptive comment while filing the report.",

Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, Sudan\u2019s military ruler and the head of its armed forces.\n\n>In bordering Libya, where a Wagner-backed rogue general, Khalifa Haftar, controls swathes of land, satellite imagery supports these claims, showing an unusual uptick in activity on Wagner bases.\n\n>The powerful Russian mercenary group has played a public and pivotal role in Moscow\u2019s foreign military campaigns, namely in Ukraine, and has repeatedly been accused of committing atrocities. In Africa, it has helped to prop up Moscow\u2019s growing influence and seizing of resources.\n\n>Dagalo and Burhan had been jockeying for power in negotiations over restoring civilian leadership in Sudan before talks broke down, erupting into some of the worst violence the country has seen in decades.\n\n>The fighting has claimed hundreds of lives and deprived millions of people from electricity, water and food.\n\n>Satellite images analyzed by CNN and open-source group \u201cAll Eyes on Wagner\u201d show one Russian transport plane shuttling between two key Libyan airbases belonging to Haftar and used by the sanctioned Russian fighting group.\n\n>Haftar has backed the RSF, sources say, although he denies taking sides. And increased Wagner activity at Haftar\u2019s bases, combined with claims by Sudanese and regional diplomatic sources, suggests that both Russia and the Libyan general may have been preparing to support the RSF even before the eruption of violence.\n\n>The uptick in movement by the Ilyushin-76 transport aircraft started two days before the conflict in Sudan began on Saturday, and continued until at least Wednesday, according to satellite images and Netherlands-based open-source specialist Gerjon.\n\n>That plane, one of a class of aircraft known by the NATO designation Candid, flew from Haftar\u2019s Khadim airbase in Libya to the Syrian coastal city of Latakia \u2013 where Russia has a major airbase \u2013 on Thursday, April 13. The next day, it flew from Latakia back to Khadim. The day after that, it flew again to another Haftar airbase in Libya\u2019s Jufra. It parked in a secluded area, something flight tracker Gerjon considered highly unusual. This was the day the conflict erupted.\n\n>The transport plane returned to Latakia on Tuesday before flying back to the Libyan militia airbase of Khadim and then to Jufra, according to Gerjon\u2019s research. That day, Russia airdropped surface-to-air missiles to Dagalo\u2019s militia positions in northwest Sudan, according to regional and Sudanese sources.\n\n>For years, Dagalo has been a key beneficiary from Russian involvement in Sudan, as the primary recipient of Moscow\u2019s weapons and training.\n\n>A July 2022 CNN investigation exposed deepening ties between Moscow and Sudan\u2019s military leadership, who granted Russia access to the east African country\u2019s gold riches in exchange for military and political support. The relationship began in earnest after Moscow\u2019s 2014 invasion of Crimea, when Russia began to eye African gold riches as an avenue to circumvent a slew of Western sanctions.\n\n>The 2022 invasion of Ukraine and the wave of sanctions that followed accelerated Russia\u2019s gold plunder in Sudan and further propped up military rule, increasing Wagner activity in the country.\n\n>On the day before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Dagalo headed a Sudanese delegation in Moscow to \u201cadvance relations\u201d between the two countries.\n\n>Burhan and the Sudanese army also previously received backing from Russia. Burhan and Dagalo were allies before the start of the fighting. Together they led coups in 2019 and 2021. Both leaders were also previously backed by the UAE and Saudi Arabia.\n\n>Both Middle Eastern powerhouses have called for calm in Sudan, amid fears of broader regional repercussions.\n\n>Yet foreign actors are already beginning to intervene in the conflict. Egypt has a long-standing relationship with Burhan and has privately backed him in the power struggle, according to Sudanese and regional diplomatic sources. A group of Egyptian soldiers were captured by the RSF at a military airport in northern Sudan on the first day of the violence, and released days later.\n\n>In a statement to CNN, the RSF denied receiving aid from Russia and Libya. Neither Haftar nor Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin responded to CNN\u2019s requests for comment.",

First of all, in one of the Perun videos a few weeks back, he noted that Russia was going to struggle with maintaining the force it currently has in the field while simultaneously bringing new tanks online. With Russia's limited industrial capacity, it will have to constantly balance between building enough spare parts to maintain its current fleet, building new tanks, repairing badly damaged vehicles, and refurbishing old vehicles taken from storage. Importantly, it will become increasingly difficult for Russia to maintain its existing fleet as most of the Russian tank fleet is already long in the tooth, and it will likely only get more difficult to refurbish vehicles pulled from storage as Russia has probably pulled the vehicles that were in the best shape first. \n\nSecondly, Michael Kofman noted in his most recent Russian Contingency podcast that Russian defense production is unable to keep up with the attrition the Russian army is facing in Ukraine. He suggests that this is likely why T-62s and T-55s are being sent to the battlefield, because these were probably vehicles that were already running or very easy to get running (Russia refurbished hundreds of T-62s prior to the war for use with reserve forces). T-62s and T-55s are of course better than no tanks at all. \n\nFinally, we've seen a noticeable decrease in the number of Russian tanks knocked out in recent weeks, which itself is a major decrease from the average number of knocked out tanks from the first 9 months of the war. Russia is increasingly using its tanks and armored vehicles sparingly, suggesting that they don't have as many available as some might think. Oftentimes when we do see footage of Russian tanks these days, they're being used in an indirect support role, firing their main guns at long-range. Even Russian propaganda films show T-90Ms being used in such a way, which again suggests they are worried about vehicles losses. Using tanks in such a way is also a pretty terrible misuse of the vehicle, as tank barrels wear out extremely quickly compared with artillery barrels and Russia will struggle to replace the barrels on their tanks over the longterm. \n\nWhile none of this proves the figures from the leaks are accurate, it does suggest that they very well might be. It also means that with Western support, it's entirely plausible that Ukraine will reach parity or possibly even have an advantage over Russia as far as tanks go, which is something no one would've thought possible a few years ago.",

Many people were dismissive of Russia mobilizing 300k men back in September since they would have little training and poor equipment. While that was true, they were enough to stabilize the lines and replenish/reinforce many badly mauled Russian units and allow for rotation. \n\nJust because the T-55s and T-62s are outdated and outgunned, and a big step down from existing Russian tanks, doesn't make them useless. They are still better than no armored support at all, and if used effectively, could be valuable additions to the Russian army. It remains to be seen in what numbers they will be available, and what state they'll be in however. \n\nThe state of some of the T-62s Russia has fielded has uhhh let's just say, not exactly been impressive.",

While that was true, they were enough to stabilize the lines and replenish/reinforce many badly mauled Russian units and allow for rotation. </p>\n\n<p>Just because the T-55s and T-62s are outdated and outgunned, and a big step down from existing Russian tanks, doesn&#39;t make them useless. They are still better than no armored support at all, and if used effectively, could be valuable additions to the Russian army. It remains to be seen in what numbers they will be available, and what state they&#39;ll be in however. </p>\n\n<p>The state of some of the T-62s Russia has fielded has uhhh let&#39;s just say, not exactly been impressive.</p>\n</div>",

In September 2022 the entire Russian front in the Northeast was literally imploding. That's what forced Putin's hand on mobilization in the first place, if he didn't, the collapse of the Russian lines could have imperiled the entire Russian war effort. If you remember correctly, there were reports of Russian mobiks being given no training at all, and rushed to the frontline. Where did they go? Luhansk, to shore up the defensive lines.

Future Ukrainian advances are more likely to look like Kherson (slow, grinding battles) than they will look like Kharkiv (rapid maneuver) specifically because Russia now has far more men actually holding the line than they did before mobilization. \n\nI'm sorry, but it's completely absurd to discount just how important holding ground is to Russia's strategy of outlasting Ukraine. \n\n>sending T-55s and T-62s against Challengers, Abrams and Leopard 2 variants is likely going to end badly for the Russian tanks.\n\nLuckily for Russia, tank on tank engagements are extremely rare in this conflict and there's small chance of the vehicles you listed ever coming into direct contact with one another.

Great Britain certainly improved during WWI, and applied those lessons later on, but the French didn't seem to learn anything from their decades long conflicts with Germany in the late 19th and into the 20th century.

Oryx doesn't have men on the ground, they don't have contractors on the ground. What they have are connections within the armies doing PR campaigns which is literally propaganda. These are not official figures being shared by the Ukrainian MoD, they are pictures released with the intent of publication value, thus having massive sampling bias and conflict of interest. Ukraine is correct and in the right to be doing a propaganda campaign during the war but that means they are not sending good quality data to the likes of Oryx.\n\n>Even propaganda reveals a ton of information, including where the video is being filmed/photo taken, from which direction, what time of the year, what equipment is involved, oftentimes what units are involved, and more. \n\nThis is a very common mistake in the world of statistics and especially machine learning (tho there is no ML being done here). That with enough quantity and filtering even poor quality data can be transformed into real value. However as someone who's in a statistics heavy field and an avid follower of ML projects I assure you that every single one of those poor data in, clean up, good results out plans has failed and pivoted to ensuring clean inputs next. It turns out that the old adage \"garbage in, garbage out\" holds true as one of the most powerful axioms of data analysis. It does not matter how valiant the people undertaking the task, it does not matter how carefully protocols are set up, if the inputs are bad then biases reverberate in the results after a while. \n\n>I agree with you that there are limitations to what OSINT can accomplish, but those limitations aren't even remotely as bad as you're trying to make them out to be. To completely discount Oryx because they don't have full control over the inputs is silly.\n\nI would like to clarify here than I do not wish to dismiss Oryx completely or OSINT. I think there is some value to be had for sure and especially lessons to be learned to set up better input data for the future. And most of all lessons to be learned about how to recognize what can be learned from lesser quality data and where to stop speculating. Recognizing limitations is not the same as giving up, it's the opposite even in many cases since you can focus on what you can reasonably learn and predict/analyze instead of overextending into areas the data is unable to support. \n\n>I'd rather have a slightly flawed picture of the balance of losses than literally none at all.\n\nSo I want to highlight this sentiment in particular since it's where most of my issues lie. I agree with the statement itself, it's why I was a big fan of Oryx updates especially early in the war. But then I saw worrying trends of creeping expectations. \"Better than nothing\" was supposed to be a warning and an understanding to curtail expectations. But instead \"better than nothing\" became an excuse to wave off concerns of limitations, a cudgel to use against people asking for a more careful approach, and a paradoxical intense trust in it as an infallible source of truth. When other OSINT rumors/reports that contradicted Oryx data emerge, they are immediately and vehemently rejected as noncredible, while external anecdotes that do line up are remembered and praised in a self motivated loop. This is worrying but whatever until a big divergence emerged in the Discord leaks. Suddenly extremely credible analysis was made available that disagreed with the imperfect 'better than nothing' we had before.

                                    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>The input data isn&#39;t that bad though, the majority of entries on the list aren&#39;t propaganda (which still has value regardless) its just raw data of pictures taken on the battlefield</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Raw pictures taken by whom and published by whom? Oryx doesn&#39;t have men on the ground, they don&#39;t have contractors on the ground. What they have are connections within the armies doing PR campaigns which is literally propaganda. These are not official figures being shared by the Ukrainian MoD, they are pictures released with the intent of publication value, thus having massive sampling bias and conflict of interest. Ukraine is correct and in the right to be doing a propaganda campaign during the war but that means they are not sending good quality data to the likes of Oryx.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Even propaganda reveals a ton of information, including where the video is being filmed/photo taken, from which direction, what time of the year, what equipment is involved, oftentimes what units are involved, and more. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is a very common mistake in the world of statistics and especially machine learning (tho there is no ML being done here). That with enough quantity and filtering even poor quality data can be transformed into real value. However as someone who&#39;s in a statistics heavy field and an avid follower of ML projects I assure you that every single one of those poor data in, clean up, good results out plans has failed and pivoted to ensuring clean inputs next. It turns out that the old adage &quot;garbage in, garbage out&quot; holds true as one of the most powerful axioms of data analysis. It does not matter how valiant the people undertaking the task, it does not matter how carefully protocols are set up, if the inputs are bad then biases reverberate in the results after a while. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I agree with you that there are limitations to what OSINT can accomplish, but those limitations aren&#39;t even remotely as bad as you&#39;re trying to make them out to be. To completely discount Oryx because they don&#39;t have full control over the inputs is silly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I would like to clarify here than I do not wish to dismiss Oryx completely or OSINT. I think there is some value to be had for sure and especially lessons to be learned to set up better input data for the future. And most of all lessons to be learned about how to recognize what can be learned from lesser quality data and where to stop speculating. Recognizing limitations is not the same as giving up, it&#39;s the opposite even in many cases since you can focus on what you can reasonably learn and predict/analyze instead of overextending into areas the data is unable to support. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I&#39;d rather have a slightly flawed picture of the balance of losses than literally none at all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So I want to highlight this sentiment in particular since it&#39;s where most of my issues lie. I agree with the statement itself, it&#39;s why I was a big fan of Oryx updates especially early in the war. But then I saw worrying trends of creeping expectations. &quot;Better than nothing&quot; was supposed to be a warning and an understanding to curtail expectations. But instead &quot;better than nothing&quot; became an excuse to wave off concerns of limitations, a cudgel to use against people asking for a more careful approach, and a paradoxical intense trust in it as an infallible source of truth. When other OSINT rumors/reports that contradicted Oryx data emerge, they are immediately and vehemently rejected as noncredible, while external anecdotes that do line up are remembered and praised in a self motivated loop. This is worrying but whatever until a big divergence emerged in the Discord leaks. Suddenly extremely credible analysis was made available that disagreed with the imperfect &#39;better than nothing&#39; we had before.

Beijing did not immediately have any comment on the US claims that Wagner had approached it for arms. But China has repeatedly denied that it has plans to supply weapons to Russia and has instead accused Nato of fuelling the conflict by providing lethal support to Ukraine.\u00a0\n\nUS intelligence listed Wagner\u2019s appeal to China alongside successful attempts to buy arms from Russia\u2019s two closest allies, Belarus and Syria.\n\nThe US report said Belarus \u201calready delivered 50 per cent of unspecified weapons promised\u201d by early January and offered to send Wagner 300,000 VOG-17 grenade launcher rounds. Wagner also bought six SPG-9 grenade launchers and 180 grenades in Syria at an unspecified time, according to the report. Wagner\u2019s personnel were \u201cuncertain where they would be sent beyond Syria\u201d, where the paramilitary force has had a presence since 2015, the report said.\n\nThe document also provided more detail on contacts between Wagner and Turkey on weapons sales, a relationship mentioned in other leaked intelligence reports.\n\nAccording to the US assessment, Wagner sent affiliates to Ankara to seek drones, electronic warfare systems, counter-battery systems and howitzer artillery. Their Turkish contacts informed Wagner they could not export some of the requested weapons and equipment, such as howitzers, counter-battery systems and some counter-drone weapons.\n\nThe report is part of more than 100 highly classified documents alleged to have been posted online by a 21-year-old member of the Massachusetts Air National Guard who was working as a systems administrator in an intelligence unit.",

Beijing did not immediately have any comment on the US claims that Wagner had approached it for arms. But China has repeatedly denied that it has plans to supply weapons to Russia and has instead accused Nato of fuelling the conflict by providing lethal support to Ukraine.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>US intelligence listed Wagner\u2019s appeal to China alongside successful attempts to buy arms from Russia\u2019s two closest allies, Belarus and Syria.</p>\n\n<p>The US report said Belarus \u201calready delivered 50 per cent of unspecified weapons promised\u201d by early January and offered to send Wagner 300,000 VOG-17 grenade launcher rounds. Wagner also bought six SPG-9 grenade launchers and 180 grenades in Syria at an unspecified time, according to the report. Wagner\u2019s personnel were \u201cuncertain where they would be sent beyond Syria\u201d, where the paramilitary force has had a presence since 2015, the report said.</p>\n\n<p>The document also provided more detail on contacts between Wagner and Turkey on weapons sales, a relationship mentioned in other leaked intelligence reports.</p>\n\n<p>According to the US assessment, Wagner sent affiliates to Ankara to seek drones, electronic warfare systems, counter-battery systems and howitzer artillery.

The Russian pilots agreed to defect but asked for a safe corridor through the Ukrainian air defence and a fighter escort.

Again, I&#39;m not saying I agree with this - in fact, I&#39;ve been to Taipei many times and would be personally devastated to see many of my good friends and colleagues fall under communist rule, just trying to explain the perspective here. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>China is the aggressor and the bully here</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From the CPC perspective, the <em>existence</em> of Taiwan as an independent entity represents the continuity of the KMT, an explicitly anti-CPC party, and reminder of China&#39;s period of humiliation at the hands of foreign powers.</p>\n</div>",

While their supply line was far from stable, it was more than enough to hold Ukrainian forces at bay and inflict heavy casualties on any Ukrainian offensive attempts.

Intragovernmental debt is relevant because it still needs to be serviced. This means that the federal government can either raise taxes or borrow more. However, it cannot borrow ad infinitum from Social Security because the fund does not bring in infinite revenue, and further borrowing to service existing interest payments on intragovernmental debt just kicks the can down the road. This does mean that inflation can effectively reduce the debt burden in the long-run, but inflation carries incurs its own macroeconomic costs and interest rates tend to be higher during inflationary periods, so the cost of servicing this debt is higher when the old short-term debt rolls over.\n\n>It's called an analogy. It's this cool trick we use in language to compare two unlike things.\n\nYes, it's a bad analogy.\n\nThe whole \"the US government owes most debt to itself\" talking point was more relevant when discussing foreign held debt, particularly that held by China. It was a response years ago to claims that China owes all the US debt (a talking point I don't really see being repeated much these days). However, trying to claim that one can simply ignore intragovernmental debt altogether is ridiculous. It still has macroeconomic effects. It doesn't just disappear in itself like an ouroboros.",

            "body": "It's not entirely clear what you're asking, which might explain the pushback. Perhaps I've not understood, but let me just address a couple of points you seem to be making:\n\n1. Russian support for the invasion is principally ideological.\n2. The ideology in question is 'Russian nationalism' and Russia is, by and large, invested in that ideology.\n\nFirst, when asked, Russian civilians [often say the invasion was defensive](https://i.imgur.com/oIKoU0I.png). Is that an \"ideological\" or \"nationalist\" view of it? It's not clear to me that either apply. It seems like a banal, pragmatic, reason to support military action. If one born of a propaganda fantasy world. What seem (at first glance) like more ideological reasons: Nazis, the Russian empire, etc, are lower.\n\nSecond, when asked *\"In your view, what should the main goal of Russian foreign policy be in the coming 10-15 years? (March 2016)\"* [57% of the respondents desire prosperity](https://i.imgur.com/TEcbsF1.png) (responses 1, 3, and 5) compared to 33% who mention more nationalist/ideological goals (2 and 4).\n\nNow, is this an unusual level of nationalism for a country like Russia, with such state control over information? With a revanchist dictator in charge for 20 years? Probably not. Is it the dominant motivation for most Russians? It doesn't appear to be.

Perhaps I&#39;ve not understood, but let me just address a couple of points you seem to be making:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Russian support for the invasion is principally ideological.</li>\n<li>The ideology in question is &#39;Russian nationalism&#39; and Russia is, by and large, invested in that ideology.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>First, when asked, Russian civilians <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/oIKoU0I.png\">often say the invasion was defensive</a>. Is that an &quot;ideological&quot; or &quot;nationalist&quot; view of it? It&#39;s not clear to me that either apply. It seems like a banal, pragmatic, reason to support military action. If one born of a propaganda fantasy world. What seem (at first glance) like more ideological reasons: Nazis, the Russian empire, etc, are lower.</p>\n\n<p>Second, when asked <em>&quot;In your view, what should the main goal of Russian foreign policy be in the coming 10-15 years? (March 2016)&quot;</em> <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/TEcbsF1.png\">57% of the respondents desire prosperity</a> (responses 1, 3, and 5) compared to 33% who mention more nationalist/ideological goals (2 and 4).</p>\n\n<p>Now, is this an unusual level of nationalism for a country like Russia, with such state control over information? With a revanchist dictator in charge for 20 years? Probably not. Is it the dominant motivation for most Russians? It doesn&#39;t appear to be. Do plenty of Russians believe in some kind of ethnic superiority or manifest destiny in the so called Slavic world? Yes. Is it <em>why</em> this invasion took place? No.</p>\n\n<p>Is it why most Russian soldiers at the front ended up there?
