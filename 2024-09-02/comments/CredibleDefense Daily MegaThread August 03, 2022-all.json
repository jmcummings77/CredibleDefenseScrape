And for that they need more artillery pieces. Which the UAF has, they're just not in the Donbas. And they won't have enough in the Donbas because the UAF GenStab made the deliberate decision to deny that to UAF defending Donbas because the GenStab feels that concentrating forces in the Donbas isn't the right call. It's prioritizing, and the Donbas hasn't been the priority for a while.\n\nThe UAF started a counteroffensive in Kharkiv in late April that took [this quiet front](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FRe6VNGXIAAts_W?format=jpg&name=large) and turned it into [this stirred up hornet's nest](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FZM1traWIAcZ4xz?format=jpg&name=large).\n\nThe UAF were defending possible Russian attacks north and west of the Kherson bridgehead with [this meager force structure](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FSK9d06XwAc-C1b?format=jpg&name=large), until late May when they launched a limited counteroffensive and are now launching [an even bigger one](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FZM2bw7WYAAiWNS?format=jpg&name=large). \n\nAll those extra units present include extra manpower, artillery pieces, other weapon systems, supplies, and most of all, accepted changes in priorities. In other words, the UAF could concentrate far more forces (and artillery) to defend the Donbas, they're choosing not to. \n\nAnd if the Donbas isn't the UA strategic main effort, that's fine. But they need to shift operational goals and tactics in the Donbas to reflect that, so they stop doing this bullshit:\n\n>99/100 times Ukrainian forces defend every village until it completely turns to rubble and they have no choice but to retreat\n\nThis is 99-100% responsible for why Ukrainian casualties are so heavy in the Donbas. They can't counter the Russian arty imbalance and yet chose tactics that favor the Russian use of arty. \n\nIf someone has lots of artillery, a static defense isn't a good way to defend, it puts the defenders in a known location to keep getting hit over and over and over. If they can't move, then dig deeper, copy basically every enemy the US fought since WW2 and tunnel underground while maximizing camouflage. But they should be as mobile as possible.\n\nAnd they can't also choose to fight static area defenses in every village, town, and city. Those need to be chosen based on their actual value, and I don't mean political morale bullshit, I'm talking about legit military value. If they try to turn every area they hold into a Thermopylae, Alamo, or Mariupol, that's exactly what they'll turn into. \n\nAnd what does that buy in exchange? The grunts in those \"hold at all cost\" static defensive positions getting hammered by artillery aren't also slaughtering hordes of Russian human wave assaults on a regular basis, they're actually rarely fighting, because Russia is using arty to win the battle and only conduct ground attacks to test defenses to see if they need more artillery. So why do they need to be there? Why do they need to hold a town they intend to evacuate as soon as it's destroyed, with heavy casualties happening along the way? \n\nNote to anyone who wants to fight well in any sort of conflict or match: Don't do what your enemy would prefer you to do, do what they'd not want you to do.",

                    "body": "What causes breakthroughs like Popasna is when the AO was denied enough reinforcements to properly man a proper defense in depth so the unit retreating, that's been beat to shit before being finally allowed to retreat, isn't expected to man the next line too. An entirely separate unit equal in size and strength needs to be behind the first line, that's how lines hold. Not by a thin layer of one line. Check out what Red Army defenses at Kursk looked like, three lines on each side of the salient but all three were manned independent of each other.\n\nAnd why would the fall back lines be less defended positions? What makes them less defended? Probably because nobody exists to dig and man them. But whatever is happening behind the front line trenches the positions they're currently holding indefinitely are getting pounded into dust, their bunkers aren't strong enough to prevent heavy casualties, so anywhere is better than where they are. There should be so many lines, so many positions that the Russians can't possibly fire destruction level artillery concentrations on them all. \n\nAnd let's talk about arty a bit too. Arty fires perform one of three functions, suppress (3-10% casualties or equipment disabled), neutralized (10-30%), or destroyed (30% or more). Russian doctrinal fires are meant to destroy, it's why they consider artillery its own maneuver element, because they're not relying on something else to actually destroy the enemy while artillery support them (which is how most western doctrine works). To destroy with arty has many variables such as enemy type, protective posture, arty type, etc, but one of the biggest factors is time: to destroy a target using arty without PGM requires lots of shells and LOTS OF TIME. Staying in one spot for as last as the Russians need gives them that time to destroy not only the villages, towns, and cities. You can't move them but you can move the troops. If the villages, towns, and cities are already doomed to be destroyed by fires, do the troops need to die too? The UAF apparently thinks yes, so politicians can say they didn't surrender them. Fuck politicians, they only screw up wars.\n\nThere is a lot of talk in the media of UAF exercising initiative and mission command decentralized authority. I've seen almost nothing to prove that, especially in the Donbas instead I'm seeing the opposite. A unit commander charged with protecting a village isn't allowed to retreat despite taking extremely heavy casualties, likely getting reinforced or entirely new units relieve the weakened ones and them taking extremely heavy casualties too, until somebody senior in rank nowhere nearby looks at a goddamn photo of the village and deems it destroyed enough to warrant retreating. That's absurd. The UAF need to give authority back to the tactical commanders, if they don't know when to retreat they don't deserve to be in command. The assholes micromanaging from Dnipro or Kyiv need to stop, especially politicians who claim they are leaving the war to the generals.\n\nIf the UAF do have to remain static, they need to be properly dug in. [This isn't](https://gdb.voanews.com/C68E5ED0-41AB-4A1A-B6EB-158C647AD3AE_w1200_r1.jpg), that is casualties waiting to occur from direct hit, which is going to happen when the defenders don't move and the Russians keep shooting at it. That's a communication trench meant only to protect against frag flying around on the ground level while troops move from bunker to bunker, which are supposed to be fully protected. Especially since the Russians are relying on drones to find UAF targets, the Russians should not be able to see UAF troops or find their positions with ease, it should be a struggle. So cover the tops of the trenches with a goddamn tarp that blocks both sight and heat. \n\nOr even better, learn from more than half a century of various armies that fought the US and go underground to avoid an opponent's fires advantage. WW2, Korea, Vietnam, all of America's enemy in those wars faced an opponent with massive arty capabilities, fantastic logistics, and air superiority-diminance, and yet all found ways to remain hidden and protect themselves using camo and cover to the maximum degree. \n\nA basic Ukrainian fighting position should be as camouflaged as a [sniper's hide](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQmNmCNQ3wKnH3E-aDwuelDQiC3OhufXJhxWw&usqp=CAU). Ukrainian troops outside of the covered and concealed positions should look like [this](https://editorial01.shutterstock.com/wm-preview-1500/7386116a/c5b2b2ba/Shutterstock_7386116a.jpg) or [this](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a4/79/43/a4794354c9f879ee3ca3f04eb4795119.png). \n\nIn terms of cove, the UAF should find out exactly what stops 152mm arty with delayed fuze, and then build to that as the only acceptable standard. If units aren't suffering high casualties from heat injuries and hernias they're not digging in hard enough. \"Dig to live.\" (Note, you can dig in while inside an urban area too, see battle of Hue, Fallujah, and Mosul). \n\nAnd the UAF are not trading damage when UAF infantry are getting ripped apart by arty while they can't shoot back because it's 8-15 km away. Even when the Russians do launch ground attacks it's rarely bigger than a platoon to company sized probing attack. What is the absolute bare minimum needed to detect a Russian ground attack and give warning? When it comes to infantry, that's all that should be outside underground bunkers within Russian artillery range. And when the rest come out to fight, they need to be under overhead cover. Got a weapon that has back blast and isn't capable of soft launch? Pop out of a spider hole, fire, and be back under cover moving in an underground tunnel within seconds to go to another spot to repeat it. Too complex? Bullshit, [ISIS did it](https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/1200/675/isisweapons2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1), Ukraine can do. \n\nAnd they have 60-200 reasons a day to light a fire under their asses to start.",

If units aren&#39;t suffering high casualties from heat injuries and hernias they&#39;re not digging in hard enough. &quot;Dig to live.&quot; (Note, you can dig in while inside an urban area too, see battle of Hue, Fallujah, and Mosul). </p>\n\n<p>And the UAF are not trading damage when UAF infantry are getting ripped apart by arty while they can&#39;t shoot back because it&#39;s 8-15 km away. Even when the Russians do launch ground attacks it&#39;s rarely bigger than a platoon to company sized probing attack. What is the absolute bare minimum needed to detect a Russian ground attack and give warning? When it comes to infantry, that&#39;s all that should be outside underground bunkers within Russian artillery range. And when the rest come out to fight, they need to be under overhead cover. Got a weapon that has back blast and isn&#39;t capable of soft launch? Pop out of a spider hole, fire, and be back under cover moving in an underground tunnel within seconds to go to another spot to repeat it. Too complex? Bullshit, <a href=\"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/1200/675/isisweapons2.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1\">ISIS did it</a>, Ukraine can do. </p>\n\n<p>And they have 60-200 reasons a day to light a fire under their asses to start.</p>\n</div>",

All of which are far slower and more inefficient, without even factoring in having to provide for civilian service. </p>\n\n<p>If Russia or the collaborationist government attempts to fix it, and it fails, that&#39;s both a resource sink and a PR disaster.</p>\n\n<p>If they don&#39;t fix it, and use it and it fails, that&#39;s also a PR disaster. </p>\n\n<p>If they do fix it, and begin using it, and then Ukraine just hits it again, they&#39;ve wasted time and resources doing so, and are once again back to ferries and pontoon crossings.</p>\n</div>",

Such measures, first of all, were aimed not at obtaining certain confidential information, but at bullying, physical humiliation, psychological demoralization.\"\n\n> In part, the intent was to have prisoners admit on camera to \"crimes committed by them, atrocities against the local population, the fighters' renunciation of their views, as well as condemnation of the actions of the leadership of Ukraine,\" the department alleged.\n\n> It went on to claim that \"the Russian side had no intention of exchanging prisoners of war and in order to hide the improper conditions and forms of interrogation of Ukrainian servicemen (which could serve as evidence at The Hague Tribunal), deliberately destroyed the prisoners.\"\n\n> Ukraine has consistently accused Russian forces of carrying out the attack last Thursday night, in response to Russian claims that Ukraine had used US high mobility artillery rocket systems to attack the center in order to prevent Ukrainian prisoners from admitting war crimes.\n\n> The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) confirmed Wednesday it had been able to visit the Olenivka facility once in May this year to deliver water tanks. \n\n> **\"But we did not have access to POWs held there on an individual basis \u2013 as per ICRC's modalities of work in detention facilities \u2013 and that continues to be the case,\" the Red Cross said.**\n\n> The ICRC added: \"Under the Third Geneva Convention, during international armed conflicts, the ICRC must be granted access to all PoWs, wherever they are held. We also have full liberty to choose the places we wish to visit.

It&#39;s why Russia greenlit the 2020 war, as punishment.  </p>\n\n<p>Russia&#39;s the only entity remotely defending Armenia right now, and they realize that and thus have begun treating us like shit because we have literally no one else to go to.  If we try flippping a) NATO won&#39;t take us b) I&#39;d say Russia will roll us, but no, they&#39;ll just step aside and let Azerbaijan do it lmao.</p>\n</div>",

The likelihood of that happening is extremely slim, the UAF aren't capable enough and the Russians aren't weak enough.\n\nThe only location a rout is very possible beyond the tactical level is the Kherson bridgehead. But that bridgehead is only an operational area holding one CAA, if they retreated it wouldn't actually be a strategic retreat because the outcome wouldn't actually dramatically change the outcome of the war by losing the bridgehead.\n\nWhereas losing Kherson oblast in the manner described above wouldn't just liberate that oblast, drive Russians out of prewar Ukraine territory, it would also cut the Land Bridge, which does have major strategic repercussions.\n\n>Is Putin betting everything that Ukraine needs to take Kherson soon or international support will fade?\n\nLots of Euro patrons have already been flagging for months and even [Biden openly questioned the UA ability to launch counteroffensives](https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/28/politics/white-house-ukraine-projection/index.html). That White House message was clearcut pressure to conduct a large scale counteroffensive.\n\nThat pressure actually makes sense from the western patrons' perspective. Without a clearcut successful UAF counteroffensive there is no proof that a long term \"successful\" war to retake UA is even feasible without massive help well beyond what was already given, so the UAF is only going to be capable of defensive ops unless only attacking Russian weak points, which won't regain them their country. The implications for that outcome is there is no further reason to support a bloody, long, costly war after the Russians finish with their Donbas offensive one way or another, long term support won't accomplish anything productive, so it'll be time to end the war through negotiations. However, if the UAF can prove they can win back territory that's seriously contested, then long term support isn't a bad investment.\n\nWhether or not the UAF intends to fight for years using western patronage is debatable, even Zelensky mentioned otherwise when he recently told the G7 summit leaders [he wants the war over by winter 2022-3](https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/28/politics/takeaways-from-g7/index.html). \n\nThat points to diplomatic negotiations to create a ceasefire agreement with both sides making concessions. The amount of concessions each side has to make revolve around who is in the better position militarily, as they'll rely on a ceasefire less than their opponent. If Ukraine performs a large scale counteroffensive and wins, they're top dog in negotiations. But if Russia can stop it, significantly delay it, or even turn it into a bloody Pyrrhic victory for Ukraine they can still lose part of Kherson oblast but retain diplomatic power.\n\n\"You'll keep attacking if I don't give you what you want? lol, do you remember what happened to you last time you tried that? Well, bring it on. Meeting over.\"  Versus \"If you halt your attacks I'll give you _____.\"",

Transition to mostly electric cars won't happen until 2030s even in most optimistic projections. All current battery production can store literally seconds of global electricity demand, so even with very rapid increases it will take like 10-20 years until any country can purchase enough batteries to last a night of no solar power. Investment in heat pumps to not burn gas, extra long distance energy transmission capacity (as renewables are inherently unpredictable) etc. - also very long term projects.\n\nIf EU wants to move closer to energy independence anytime soon, (cleanish) coal, nuclear, fracking, and other energy exploration are things it needs to consider first.

Transition to mostly electric cars won&#39;t happen until 2030s even in most optimistic projections. All current battery production can store literally seconds of global electricity demand, so even with very rapid increases it will take like 10-20 years until any country can purchase enough batteries to last a night of no solar power. Investment in heat pumps to not burn gas, extra long distance energy transmission capacity (as renewables are inherently unpredictable) etc. - also very long term projects.</p>\n\n<p>If EU wants to move closer to energy independence anytime soon, (cleanish) coal, nuclear, fracking, and other energy exploration are things it needs to consider first. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_energy_independence\">US managed to achieve that in 10 years</a>, but EU green lobby would fight that every single step.</p>\n</div>",
