So, basically things they are already doing.\n\nThen wargaming with Ukraine's staff on how Russia will respond to the breaching force, where the Russian assets will come from, how Russia will supply them, where Russian air assets will respond from, etc. So, things they have already done with Ukraine in the past.\n\nLater actually providing the near real time intelligence of what Russia actually does in response to the breach. I think the operational pause here by Ukraine is not just being used to reoutfit, rotate, and give R&R but also giving a high level strategy for the next 1-3 years of the oncoming campaigns. Or at least, I hope that's how it is being used. Ukraine seems to be pretty good at all of this already. \n\nIf I could wish for one thing from the Ukrainian army, is that it could take all of it's experience it has gained up to this point in smaller scale offensives in terms of operational tempo, needs per day for things like shells, ammo, food, medical evac etc, and then turn that into supplying a much much larger force at the point of breach. In other words, bring to bear what some might consider to be a modern Western army's scale of personnel and force application to the point for the southern breach.

So, basically things they are already doing.</p>\n\n<p>Then wargaming with Ukraine&#39;s staff on how Russia will respond to the breaching force, where the Russian assets will come from, how Russia will supply them, where Russian air assets will respond from, etc. So, things they have already done with Ukraine in the past.</p>\n\n<p>Later actually providing the near real time intelligence of what Russia actually does in response to the breach. I think the operational pause here by Ukraine is not just being used to reoutfit, rotate, and give R&amp;R but also giving a high level strategy for the next 1-3 years of the oncoming campaigns. Or at least, I hope that&#39;s how it is being used. Ukraine seems to be pretty good at all of this already. </p>\n\n<p>If I could wish for one thing from the Ukrainian army, is that it could take all of it&#39;s experience it has gained up to this point in smaller scale offensives in terms of operational tempo, needs per day for things like shells, ammo, food, medical evac etc, and then turn that into supplying a much much larger force at the point of breach. In other words, bring to bear what some might consider to be a modern Western army&#39;s scale of personnel and force application to the point for the southern breach. Or even just a fraction of that (eg something like 40,000) would be great with an ability to sustain exploitation after.</p>\n</div>",

But that is a purely irrational decision, it actively ignores reality in the face of denial and desire for normalcy.\n\nMobilization isn't supposed to be done after war starts, it's supposed to be done so it's possible to fight back, the first step to a war footing necessary to carry out the most basic war plans. Ukraine mobilizing to defend its borders isn't an act of war for Russia to invade, and even if Russia used that as a public excuse it still wouldn't validate what they did.\n\nAnd Russia didn't need a propaganda coup to launch an invasion, they were already going to do it, their war plan was made public months before. The Nazi rhetoric was going on for the better part of half a year at that point but nobody outside of Russia was fooled by it. And the biggest coup for Russian propaganda would be military success, which could have been lessened even more had Ukraine actually been militarily and civilly ready to withstand an invasion. We cheer that Russia was halted at the outskirts of Kyiv and forced to retreat, but that battle shouldn't have happened anywhere close to there nor been anywhere as uncertain. Nor should the Crimea breakout have occurred at all, OC-S had over a half dozen brigades under its control, and yet there were only two battalions in Kherson oblast and only one of them near the Isthmus of Perekop. The TDF that Ukraine was totally reliant on to survive didn't even really exist until invasion day and yet they could have mustered them weeks before, to include in places like Kherson and Zaporizhzhia where unlike Kyiv-Chernihiv-Sumy-Kharkiv oblasts, they didn't mobilize in time to help defend the south. Totally unacceptable.\n\nAnd I don't think Russia could invade earlier than they did without them being even less prepared than they were, which is telling since they were already grossly unprepared. Even if a UAF mobilization triggers an invasion, the Russians still take another 1-2 days to invade, the UAF get two those full days to prepare and move forces, etc. Plus, there was the intelligence about needing to wait until after the Chinese Olympics ended (Feb 20), which is so stupid it probably is true.\n\nAnd which fence sitter in other countries were won over by Ukrainian refusal to prepare to defend itself? And what does it mean for them to be won over? What did Ukraine get out of that? The primary benefactors, US, UK, PL, were all onboard before and wanted Ukraine to mobilize. And all the countries that helped afterwards did so either due to pressure from the US or because it was a legit popular cause to support. Russia didn't need to gobble up a substantial part of the country due to lack of readiness to achieve that support.\n\nZelensky isn't unique in history, he ignored evidence and made a bad call. But he's a sitting politician, he's going to have to run for office again at some point and he's not going to want to do so while dodging allegations that he nearly cost Ukraine the war, so he's been doing damage control on this topic since the war started.",

It&#39;s not like democracies never does foreign policy without it being in the center of the news cycle. The US and NATO is capable of having long term strategies. Just look at the cold war. The problem, including in 2014, was denialism about how unreasonable Putin and Russia really is.</p>\n</div>",

Discounting the fact that domestic economic issues like inflation influence US voters is unwise, to say the least. That aside, I consider Trump to have been a major factor in tipping the scales back toward the incumbents; IMO he was a dead weight on the party. That could still be the case in two years, but judging by recent events I'm beginning to doubt it.\n\n> Also, other than chips, can you please explain which areas of support for Ukraine are going to cause state side inflation pressures?\n\nAny Ukrainian spending of the economic aid from US that affects US balance of trade will affect stateside inflation.

Not since the days of the USSR when [Soviet Military Power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Military_Power) was published as far as I'm aware. If you're looking at numbers online, like wiki, those numbers typically come from the IISS Military Balance. The IISS is a think tank, with no connection to the Russia government or any government. If I pull numbers from the 2021 ISS Military Balance:\n\n> ARMOURED FIGHTING VEHICLES\nMBT 2,840: 650 T-72B/BA; 850 T-72B3; 530 T-72B3M;\n310 T-80BV/U; 140 T-80BVM; 350 T-90/T-90A; 10 T-90M;\n(10,200 in store: 7,000 T-72/T-72A/B; 3,000 T-80B/BV/U;\n200 T-90)\n\nSo IISS estimated Russia had a bit under 3,000 tanks active before the war, and 10,000 in storage. Which is where this 10,000 number came from, despite the fact that Russia **never** stated it had 10,000 active tanks. Or 1,000 tanks, as Russia doesn't report that. As far as storage conditions, there has been multiple articles covering that. Some good, some bad. But people seem to think that military vehicles in long-term storage are operable, but generally speaking they're not. Most of the stored M1 tanks at SAID are both outmodded and worn out, but military acquisitions are typically acquired for the long term. Being that active units in the US military are constantly training, if not deployed, they wear out their equipment, like tanks. The US hasn't produced a new build M1 tank since 1996. So Anniston Army Depot(Or Lima*) takes a worn out M1 from SAID and strips it completely down, including hanging the naked hull vertically a massive booth and sandblasting the entire thing. This is where \"new\" M1 tanks start, including the ongoing orders for Taiwan's M1A2Ts and Poland's M1A2 Sepv3. For the US rebuilt tanks are sent to active units, and the unit sends their worn out and/or outmodded tanks to SIAD.\n\nNobody who is involved in the defense community, or hobbyists like me, believed Russia could roll out with 10,000 tanks. Rather that they have thousands of hulls, turrets, suspension components, etc, which are still military assets.",

Propaganda you may say, but there's only so much denial of reality the average mobik can do, given that the Ukrainians clearly are not perpetrating genocide against them, and not even the nuttiest of state propaganda has claimed the Ukrainians have invaded the actual Russian heartland.

Propaganda you may say, but there&#39;s only so much denial of reality the average mobik can do, given that the Ukrainians clearly are not perpetrating genocide against them, and not even the nuttiest of state propaganda has claimed the Ukrainians have invaded the actual Russian heartland.

There were also a handful of flights from Wuhan chartered by the U.S. State Department to evacuate American citizens, including diplomats and their families, beginning on Jan. 28. Passengers on those planes were flown to military bases in California and were mandated to complete a 14-day quarantine.\n\n>On April 21, Ferguson provided an \u201cupdate\u201d to his April 5 column in which he acknowledged, \u201cData from sensors tracking actual flight paths would seem to indicate that no flights left from Wuhan itself to other countries in the world after January 23.\u201d Ferguson wrote that he reached out to the U.S. company Flightspin, and that officials there \u201cconcluded that it was very unlikely indeed that any flights had gone from Wuhan to Western cities after January 23.\u201d\n\nStill think it's stupid to assume they'll shut down all non-Wuhan transportation, domestic AND international with the knowledge they had back then.  It's a tough call to shut down your economy without the benefit of hindsight on how bad it could be.

There were also a handful of flights from Wuhan chartered by the U.S. State Department to evacuate American citizens, including diplomats and their families, beginning on Jan. 28. Passengers on those planes were flown to military bases in California and were mandated to complete a 14-day quarantine.</p>\n\n<p>On April 21, Ferguson provided an \u201cupdate\u201d to his April 5 column in which he acknowledged, \u201cData from sensors tracking actual flight paths would seem to indicate that no flights left from Wuhan itself to other countries in the world after January 23.\u201d Ferguson wrote that he reached out to the U.S. company Flightspin, and that officials there \u201cconcluded that it was very unlikely indeed that any flights had gone from Wuhan to Western cities after January 23.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Still think it&#39;s stupid to assume they&#39;ll shut down all non-Wuhan transportation, domestic AND international with the knowledge they had back then.  It&#39;s a tough call to shut down your economy without the benefit of hindsight on how bad it could be.  Might be an argument for moral culpability but not a realistic expectation they&#39;ll shut down flights from Shanghai and Beijing as well.
