Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

Let&#39;s not even move any more brigades any closer, the 72nd Brigade is stationed 220 km away from the most defensible location near the border, that&#39;s good enough to defend the capital of my country.&quot;</p>\n</div>",

                    "body": "Even with rotations at the battalion level, only a small number of brigades can do that, as battalions are not at all interchangeable due to type, levels of training, logistics, etc. Its way easier to try it when on the defensive, a brigade HQ can use nearly any type of battalion and make it work if their immediate tactical rear areas are secure (which they were, for the most part, over 2022-23). \n\nBut it's a totally different story trying that on the offensive. Every battalion likely is equipped with totally different types of weapons, vehicles, etc, making logistics and planning nearly impossible. Not to mention the competence of different units, I can't imagine trying to run a brigade HQ and fight my battalions if there was absolutely no standardization, to include skill, experience, and especially training, with my operational level leadership not remotely giving a shit when they gave me a mission. It's one thing to be given a \"Hold \\_\\_\\_\\_ villages at all cost\" and succeed with a smorgasbord of battalions or even companies, but I'd shoot myself in the foot just to avoid being responsible with going on the offensive with that trash. That is a recipe for disaster.  \n\nAdditionally, though I'm not sure about this, I've read reports that many of the extra battalions used to buff out brigades over the fall winter during static fighting ended up being used to create the maneuver battalions for some of the new brigades. Again, not sure if its true, and I can't even remember where I heard it. Though it made sense, since the only reason for having so many battalions in the first place were the lack of brigade HQs to place them under (much harder to create than a battalion). Realistically, there is a very good reason not to overload brigades with so many battalions, the Ukrainians aren't brilliant for trying to, they're just desperate for more maneuver battalions willing to forgo that they can't even create more brigade HQs, let alone the absolutely critical dedicated division command structure they still lack and can only replicate on an ad hoc level (usually by sending a random brigadier general to take over a collection of brigades).  \n\nAlso, the method for relief that you described is too few units to make that work outside of a pretty chill period, or one where there is just an absolutely overabundance of forces where a brigade sector is so small they can have 4-5 battalions but only 1-2 actively fighting, 1-2 in tactical reserve, and 1 sent all the way to the strategic rear for extended periods (if not total loss).  That would first suggest a tiny frontage for the brigade (something not likely considering that both sides still don't have enough forces to do that, outside very specific main effort locations). \n\nBut also units who might have so many extra maneuver battalions that are permanently attached still couldn't do that in a hotly contested location. For example Bakhmut was a shitshow since January, best described as one emergency following the next. How is any unit defending it supposed to be able to \"hold at all cost\" (which was pretty obvious what they were ordered to do), while also keeping \\~50% of their unit in reserve? And why would one unit get away with that when the UAF were committing units from the strategic reserve back in March, sending barely trained soldiers as replacements to existing units on the line (some with less than three weeks of training), and even placing elite SOF units on the zero line too (which is basically the worst way to use them). \n\nMy guess is that if the Azov brigade had that option it was because Wagner shifted its offensive effort, strength, and fires away from the southern flank, where 3rd Assault were stationed, to the city itself around late March, so their sector was basically the \"quietest\" during the remainder of the battle, which is why they were able to rotate and counterattack too, (had they not attacked, they'd be unoccupied, which is a near crime in wastefulness). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I can't imagine brigades spending this long in the hottest part of the front and not completely shattering.\n\nFrom what I've observed, they're using an individual replacement system whenever they don't have the means to rotate units. To include feeding them into units that are on the zero line, and even when in direct contact with the Russians. \n\nIts not their sole means of reconstitution or even preferred, as they seem to favor unit rotations when possible, but its been done quite a bit since the war started especially in critical sectors. \n\nOtherwise they're surely rotating some companies and definitely as possible into the tactical reserve in their immediate rear area, for a few days or even a week of rest and recuperation, where they can also take in new replacements in a more efficient manner. \n\nIn a location like Bakhmut, Chasiv Yar was used for that as it was outside most artillery range, already used as the tactical and operational level hub for command and logistics, etc.",

That is a recipe for disaster.  </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, though I&#39;m not sure about this, I&#39;ve read reports that many of the extra battalions used to buff out brigades over the fall winter during static fighting ended up being used to create the maneuver battalions for some of the new brigades. Again, not sure if its true, and I can&#39;t even remember where I heard it. Though it made sense, since the only reason for having so many battalions in the first place were the lack of brigade HQs to place them under (much harder to create than a battalion). Realistically, there is a very good reason not to overload brigades with so many battalions, the Ukrainians aren&#39;t brilliant for trying to, they&#39;re just desperate for more maneuver battalions willing to forgo that they can&#39;t even create more brigade HQs, let alone the absolutely critical dedicated division command structure they still lack and can only replicate on an ad hoc level (usually by sending a random brigadier general to take over a collection of brigades).  </p>\n\n<p>Also, the method for relief that you described is too few units to make that work outside of a pretty chill period, or one where there is just an absolutely overabundance of forces where a brigade sector is so small they can have 4-5 battalions but only 1-2 actively fighting, 1-2 in tactical reserve, and 1 sent all the way to the strategic rear for extended periods (if not total loss).  That would first suggest a tiny frontage for the brigade (something not likely considering that both sides still don&#39;t have enough forces to do that, outside very specific main effort locations). </p>\n\n<p>But also units who might have so many extra maneuver battalions that are permanently attached still couldn&#39;t do that in a hotly contested location. For example Bakhmut was a shitshow since January, best described as one emergency following the next. How is any unit defending it supposed to be able to &quot;hold at all cost&quot; (which was pretty obvious what they were ordered to do), while also keeping ~50% of their unit in reserve? And why would one unit get away with that when the UAF were committing units from the strategic reserve back in March, sending barely trained soldiers as replacements to existing units on the line (some with less than three weeks of training), and even placing elite SOF units on the zero line too (which is basically the worst way to use them). </p>\n\n<p>My guess is that if the Azov brigade had that option it was because Wagner shifted its offensive effort, strength, and fires away from the southern flank, where 3rd Assault were stationed, to the city itself around late March, so their sector was basically the &quot;quietest&quot; during the remainder of the battle, which is why they were able to rotate and counterattack too, (had they not attacked, they&#39;d be unoccupied, which is a near crime in wastefulness). </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I can&#39;t imagine brigades spending this long in the hottest part of the front and not completely shattering.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From what I&#39;ve observed, they&#39;re using an individual replacement system whenever they don&#39;t have the means to rotate units. To include feeding them into units that are on the zero line, and even when in direct contact with the Russians. </p>\n\n<p>Its not their sole means of reconstitution or even preferred, as they seem to favor unit rotations when possible, but its been done quite a bit since the war started especially in critical sectors. </p>\n\n<p>Otherwise they&#39;re surely rotating some companies and definitely as possible into the tactical reserve in their immediate rear area, for a few days or even a week of rest and recuperation, where they can also take in new replacements in a more efficient manner. </p>\n\n<p>In a location like Bakhmut, Chasiv Yar was used for that as it was outside most artillery range, already used as the tactical and operational level hub for command and logistics, etc.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "[Ben Wallace](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/ben-wallace-im-resigning-from-politics-next-cabinet-reshuffle-2023-k0x9st2rt) is leaving government. And before imaginations get too carried away:\n\n> But the reason he is looking back in this way is that he has decided to leave the cabinet at the next reshuffle \u2014 expected in September \u2014 and, after 18 years in parliament, will not fight the next general election.\n\n>\u201cI\u2019m not standing next time,\u201d he said, but ruled out going \u201cprematurely\u201d and forcing a by-election as other Johnson allies have done. \u201cI went into politics in the Scottish parliament in 1999. That\u2019s 24 years. I\u2019ve spent well over seven years with three phones by my bed.\u201d What are they for? \u201cSecret, secret and secret.\u201d\n\n>**Wallace told Rishi Sunak his plans on June 16** but had hoped to make the announcement over the summer, when it would not have contributed to the narrative of Tory decline or looked like a response to the three by-election losses expected on Thursday.  But someone in government briefed in the past few days that the time might be right for him to stand down.\n\nNot sure if this is free to read, but it\u2019s an interesting and lengthy article. Lots of fluff, so just pasting the relevant bits:\n\n>Just before the start of the war in Ukraine, Ben Wallace and his Ukrainian counterpart Oleksii Reznikov had to speak in code. Before secure communications were established with Kyiv, the defence secretary referred to the weapons systems Britain was supplying to Ukraine as if he was shipping a consignment of drinks.\n\n>Wallace, who served as a captain in the Scots Guards and then as a member of the Scottish parliament before he arrived in Westminster, said: \u201cI just picked whiskies. So the Nlaw [anti-tank missile] was Glenfiddich and Harpoon anti-ship missiles were Islay. I would text him saying \u2018I\u2019ve got some whisky for you\u2019 or \u2018the whisky is on its way\u2019. We just picked codewords, minister to minister.\u201d\n\n>On the eve of the conflict Wallace went to Moscow to meet Sergei Shoigu, the Russian defence minister, who lied to his face, saying there would be no invasion. Wallace enjoyed a deception of his own. \u201cWe were exchanging gifts and I gave him a bottle of Glenfiddich. He didn\u2019t know what it meant. The joke was on him.\u201d\n\n>During Wallace\u2019s watch as security minister and then defence secretary there were several terrorist attacks including the Manchester Arena bomb, not to mention the Skripal poisoning, Covid, the withdrawal from Afghanistan and now Ukraine. But his proudest achievement is the war he waged in Whitehall for defence. \u201cI\u2019ve coupled all that with a \u00a324 billion budget increase, reform of defence and investment in army modernisation,\u201d he said.\n\n>\u201cI took over a department that had suffered 30 years of cuts and conceded that the whole of government was about health and education, while defence was just a discretionary spend. What I hope I\u2019ve managed to do the last four years is unlock genuinely new money and win the argument that defence is core.\u201d\n\n>He points out that Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, called for defence spending of 3 per cent of GDP when he ran for leader in 2019. \u201cThe prime minister has committed to 2.5 per cent \u2014 although without a date.\u201d Wallace does not want to cause trouble now, but it is clear that this is a legacy he will speak out to protect if he has to.\n\n>Higher defence spending is not just legacy vanity. Wallace says it is a necessity. As the minister with the most national security experience in the government, the picture he paints of the risks ahead is eye-watering. \u201cTowards the end of the decade, the world is going to be much more unsafe, more insecure. I think we will find ourselves in a conflict. Whether it is a cold or a warm conflict, I think we\u2019ll be in a difficult position.\u201d\n\n>Asked what keeps him awake at night, Wallace says it is a combination of the continuing threat from Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia, an increasingly aggressive China and terrorist groups that have still not gone away.\n\n>On terrorism, he warns that Britain could be dragged into a shooting war in Africa, where al-Qaeda and Isis threaten the future of nation states. He says: \u201cWe could see a resurgence of Isis or al-Qaeda in Africa that would trigger us internationally coming to the aid of a nation. Al-Qaeda in Africa is growing because some of the governments aren\u2019t able to withstand them. Al-Shabaab in Somalia is al-Qaeda\u2019s biggest faction. In North Africa and in west Africa \u2014 Mali, Burkina Faso \u2014 it\u2019s a threat. Isis took over a town last year in Mozambique out of nowhere.\u201d\n\n>Wallace has blunt words about China\u2019s expansionist activities in the South China Sea, where the regime in Beijing has been constructing new islands and stationing military equipment. \u201cWe could see a total breakdown of politics in the Pacific,\u201d he said \u201cYou could find yourself by 2030 in a position of Cold War.\u201d\n\n>Wallace is concerned about Xi Jinping\u2019s desire to take Taiwan. \u201cIt\u2019s not a secret. He\u2019s published it.\u201d Britain\u2019s position is that such a change can only take place peacefully with the consent of the Taiwanese. Any conflict there could have disastrous consequences: \u201cIt makes us deeply vulnerable. Taiwan manufactures 90 per cent of the world\u2019s most powerful chips in literally one factory.\u201d\n\n>Wallace wants to \u201ckeep talking to China\u201d and believes the West needs a more coherent political strategy. But he added: \u201cI think the most worrying thing, the thing we have to worry about more, is in the South China Sea, where sovereignty is being actually stolen or established by China in areas that other nations would view as their economic zones. You see a China-Vietnam dispute on fishing grounds, China-Philippines disputes on fishing. The Chinese arrive with these massive flotillas.\u201d\n\n>Despite these flashpoints, his greatest concern is the danger of military conflict with Russia, accidental or otherwise. \u201cIf Putin loses in Ukraine, he will be deeply wounded,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cHe\u2019s still got an air force and he\u2019s still got a navy \u2014 and we see his navy do quite aggressive manoeuvres. Putin is not done with us yet. There is an ability for him, in the next three or four years, to lash out.\n\n>\u201cHe\u2019s not finished. He will look for people to blame. It was put it out that the British were behind the Prigozhin plot [when Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of the Wagner mercenary group, staged a brief armed rebellion] by a Russian government stooge.\u201d\n\n>While the threat of Putin using nuclear weapons has receded, partly because both China and India have made clear to the Kremlin that it would be unacceptable, Wallace adds: \u201cIt\u2019s still there in their doctrine. They have a doctrine for the use of tactical nuclear weapons, which is anathema to all of us.\u201d\n\n>One way Russia could cripple the UK would be to attack undersea cables carrying communications links and energy supplies. \u201cRussia has a programme to have the ability to attack critical infrastructure on the seabed, whether that\u2019s fibre-optics or gas and oil. They have ships and submarines for it.\u201d\n\n>His outspoken demands for European countries to do more to pay their way in Nato did not endear him to some. \u201cYou can\u2019t take for granted your allies and partners,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to contribute. If everyone in Nato matched our donations to Ukraine as a percentage of GDP, there would be another \u00a320 billion of military aid available. It\u2019s still the case that only 20 per cent of the defence spending of Nato is by EU members.\u201d\n\n>Despite warm words from President Biden\u2019s White House, Wallace did not get the backing of the Americans for the Nato job. \u201cWhy do you not support your closest ally when they put forward a candidate? I think it\u2019s a fair question.\u201d\n\n>Wallace says he is not standing down because of impending defeat. His Wyre and Preston North seat is being scrapped after boundary changes, but he could easily move to one of the new ones. \u201cI like a good fight. Opposition doesn\u2019t scare me.\u201d But he goes on: \u201cI think the government can win the election. In my part of the world, I don\u2019t think those voters are yet convinced at all by Keir Starmer. It\u2019s definitely up for grabs.\u201d",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/ben-wallace-im-resigning-from-politics-next-cabinet-reshuffle-2023-k0x9st2rt\">Ben Wallace</a> is leaving government. And before imaginations get too carried away:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>But the reason he is looking back in this way is that he has decided to leave the cabinet at the next reshuffle \u2014 expected in September \u2014 and, after 18 years in parliament, will not fight the next general election.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not standing next time,\u201d he said, but ruled out going \u201cprematurely\u201d and forcing a by-election as other Johnson allies have done. \u201cI went into politics in the Scottish parliament in 1999. That\u2019s 24 years. I\u2019ve spent well over seven years with three phones by my bed.\u201d What are they for? \u201cSecret, secret and secret.\u201d</p>\n\n<p><strong>Wallace told Rishi Sunak his plans on June 16</strong> but had hoped to make the announcement over the summer, when it would not have contributed to the narrative of Tory decline or looked like a response to the three by-election losses expected on Thursday.  But someone in government briefed in the past few days that the time might be right for him to stand down.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Not sure if this is free to read, but it\u2019s an interesting and lengthy article. Lots of fluff, so just pasting the relevant bits:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Just before the start of the war in Ukraine, Ben Wallace and his Ukrainian counterpart Oleksii Reznikov had to speak in code. Before secure communications were established with Kyiv, the defence secretary referred to the weapons systems Britain was supplying to Ukraine as if he was shipping a consignment of drinks.</p>\n\n<p>Wallace, who served as a captain in the Scots Guards and then as a member of the Scottish parliament before he arrived in Westminster, said: \u201cI just picked whiskies. So the Nlaw [anti-tank missile] was Glenfiddich and Harpoon anti-ship missiles were Islay. I would text him saying \u2018I\u2019ve got some whisky for you\u2019 or \u2018the whisky is on its way\u2019. We just picked codewords, minister to minister.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>On the eve of the conflict Wallace went to Moscow to meet Sergei Shoigu, the Russian defence minister, who lied to his face, saying there would be no invasion. Wallace enjoyed a deception of his own. \u201cWe were exchanging gifts and I gave him a bottle of Glenfiddich. He didn\u2019t know what it meant. The joke was on him.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>During Wallace\u2019s watch as security minister and then defence secretary there were several terrorist attacks including the Manchester Arena bomb, not to mention the Skripal poisoning, Covid, the withdrawal from Afghanistan and now Ukraine. But his proudest achievement is the war he waged in Whitehall for defence. \u201cI\u2019ve coupled all that with a \u00a324 billion budget increase, reform of defence and investment in army modernisation,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI took over a department that had suffered 30 years of cuts and conceded that the whole of government was about health and education, while defence was just a discretionary spend. What I hope I\u2019ve managed to do the last four years is unlock genuinely new money and win the argument that defence is core.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He points out that Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, called for defence spending of 3 per cent of GDP when he ran for leader in 2019. \u201cThe prime minister has committed to 2.5 per cent \u2014 although without a date.\u201d Wallace does not want to cause trouble now, but it is clear that this is a legacy he will speak out to protect if he has to.</p>\n\n<p>Higher defence spending is not just legacy vanity. Wallace says it is a necessity. As the minister with the most national security experience in the government, the picture he paints of the risks ahead is eye-watering. \u201cTowards the end of the decade, the world is going to be much more unsafe, more insecure. I think we will find ourselves in a conflict. Whether it is a cold or a warm conflict, I think we\u2019ll be in a difficult position.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Asked what keeps him awake at night, Wallace says it is a combination of the continuing threat from Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia, an increasingly aggressive China and terrorist groups that have still not gone away.</p>\n\n<p>On terrorism, he warns that Britain could be dragged into a shooting war in Africa, where al-Qaeda and Isis threaten the future of nation states. He says: \u201cWe could see a resurgence of Isis or al-Qaeda in Africa that would trigger us internationally coming to the aid of a nation. Al-Qaeda in Africa is growing because some of the governments aren\u2019t able to withstand them. Al-Shabaab in Somalia is al-Qaeda\u2019s biggest faction. In North Africa and in west Africa \u2014 Mali, Burkina Faso \u2014 it\u2019s a threat. Isis took over a town last year in Mozambique out of nowhere.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Wallace has blunt words about China\u2019s expansionist activities in the South China Sea, where the regime in Beijing has been constructing new islands and stationing military equipment. \u201cWe could see a total breakdown of politics in the Pacific,\u201d he said \u201cYou could find yourself by 2030 in a position of Cold War.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Wallace is concerned about Xi Jinping\u2019s desire to take Taiwan. \u201cIt\u2019s not a secret. He\u2019s published it.\u201d Britain\u2019s position is that such a change can only take place peacefully with the consent of the Taiwanese. Any conflict there could have disastrous consequences: \u201cIt makes us deeply vulnerable. Taiwan manufactures 90 per cent of the world\u2019s most powerful chips in literally one factory.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Wallace wants to \u201ckeep talking to China\u201d and believes the West needs a more coherent political strategy. But he added: \u201cI think the most worrying thing, the thing we have to worry about more, is in the South China Sea, where sovereignty is being actually stolen or established by China in areas that other nations would view as their economic zones. You see a China-Vietnam dispute on fishing grounds, China-Philippines disputes on fishing. The Chinese arrive with these massive flotillas.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Despite these flashpoints, his greatest concern is the danger of military conflict with Russia, accidental or otherwise. \u201cIf Putin loses in Ukraine, he will be deeply wounded,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cHe\u2019s still got an air force and he\u2019s still got a navy \u2014 and we see his navy do quite aggressive manoeuvres.

I understand there are limitations on the part of tactical air support with regards to heavy Russian air defense, limited ability to input GPS coordinates in because of equipment disparity, and EW measures, but the ability to lob several 500 to 2000lb bombs onto a hardened target within 50 meters even in a GPS degraded environment seems like a hard thing to pass on if you're trying to clear static defense positions. Is there a limit to the amount of JDAMs provided to Ukraine, limit to airframes available for sortie, or risk aversion to save existing airframes and only utilize JDAMs for high priority targets?",

With your attack planned on x, and with the route planned as y, I want to place our uparmored Humvee at z, 600 meters short of the objective. From that defilade area we can launch three drones, each capable of either ISR or dropping 40mm HE grenades. We&#39;ll be monitoring your company net, giving updates on anything we see. If you need direct support, call us, our callsign is Deez Nutz 05.&quot;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>And the operator could link with the drone using lasers</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Who&#39;s going to make drones with those capabilities? How will Ukraine get them issued by the many thousands per month?</p>\n</div>",

There needs to be drone solutions for supporting infantry in these situations\n\nA lot of people throw the term air superiority and air support a lot not realizing really what they are doing, so its best to actually break it down in roles or missions to figure out what Ukraine actually needs:\n\n\\- ISR - The original air mission was reconnaissance of the enemy front line from a higher angle and especially rear areas. Manned fixed or rotary wing aircraft have been largely replaced in this role by various types of drones, which not only are far cheaper to operate but also have better survivability due to smaller radar profile, and without the risk of losing a trained pilot on a dangerous mission. They probably need more ISR tactical drones of the sort that fly at high altitudes and are hardened against EW, basically their own Orlan. At the lower levels, attack and ISR drones need to be more secure, which is why they lose so many per month against EW.  \n\n\\- Strategic bombing: That was the mission in the Interwar Years that sold Air Power (capitalized) ideology especially in the UK and US, with the idea that they alone could win future wars (thus, Armies and Navies can be defunded). Bombers would destroy strategically important targets, fighters protect the homeland so enemy bombers can't do it to us. It's morphed quite a bit over the last century beyond that ridiculous doctrine, and nowadays its most easily done by ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and long range drones (see strikes on Ukrainian infrastructure in Kyiv and elsewhere). The only type of manned aircraft with actual survivability against an enemy with decent air defenses are stealth bombers, which only the US possesses. So that seems to be another mission that manned fixed wing aircraft will likely lose out on. And one that Ukraine doesn't need because the US and other NATO allies do not want them escalating the conflict by strategic attacks on Russia. \n\n\\- Air Defense: Defending against enemy air attacks. This is the role Ukraine most desperately wants NATO aircraft for, not so much for the better aircraft but the abilty to use better NATO weapons, namely faster and longer range, that they can't use with their existing fleet. \n\n\\- Air Interdiction/Deep Air Support: These are attacks into the enemy's rear areas, both tactical and operational zones (up to 100 kilometers or more). They're striking assembly areas, command and control, supply lines, supply hubs, enemy columns conducting road marches, trains, and anything else they can find. A large part of these missions can be replicated by long range missiles or drones. However, long range PGMs rely on intelligence that is unlikely to result in real time actionable intel, plus they would have trouble with moving targets. TB2s would do great in this role, but air defenses are too stout. This is where air superiority would be needed for a total SEAD/DEAD capability, but only two countries have the ability to even attempt that, US and Israel. Ukraine wants F-16/Grippen to help with this role, though its very unlikely they'll ever come close to being able to achieve even limited suppression of Russian air defenses to get into their rear areas in anything that isn't 1) very rare 2) Suicide. If a stealth UCAV exists, this is the role its suited for. \n\n\\- Close Air Support: The targeting of enemy on the front line, either looking for and engaging at will, or on order of ground forces. For fixed wing aircraft, this is considered the least effective use of airpower by pretty much every air force in history (for tactical support, they believe air interdiction provides much better effects). Additionally, all ground force units possess organic weaponry that already does that same level of support (namely artillery). Rotary wing provides an added role, namely ATGM support from low altitude (similar to current Russian use of KA-52). Ukrainians could replicate that that with Apaches and Hellfire, which is surprisingly something they haven't asked for.",

It appears that the much-touted maneuver warfare, conducted over vast minefields and in full view of Russian recon drones, and 10km-range laser-guided missiles from attack helicopters, is not proving to be a winning strategy.

Otherwise, I'm very bearish that the deployment of Western IFVs or MBTs in quantities of a few hundred is good a approach to overcoming Russian artillery.\n\n---\n\nI would like to point out that on yesterday's [Geopolitics Decanted podcast](https://podcast.silverado.org/episodes/trip-report-what-i-learned-in-kyiv-and-conversation-with-mike-kofman-and-rob-lee-about-counteroffensive-and-wagner), Mike Kofman and Rob Lee explored a hypothetical situation: if NATO troops found themselves in a similar predicament as the Ukrainians, that is, without air superiority, how well would they fare against Russian defense lines? They concluded that NATO troops would only perform marginally better. The task is just \\*that\\* hard.\n\n---\n\nI remain excited about GSLDBs (another a bit longer range PGM). From my perspective, based on how Ukraine is utilizing Storm Shadows, it seems that at least half of the Shadow's targets could be serviced by GLSDBs (various hotels/retreats full of Russian soldiers on vacation in Ukraine).",

Otherwise, I&#39;m very bearish that the deployment of Western IFVs or MBTs in quantities of a few hundred is good a approach to overcoming Russian artillery.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>I would like to point out that on yesterday&#39;s <a href=\"https://podcast.silverado.org/episodes/trip-report-what-i-learned-in-kyiv-and-conversation-with-mike-kofman-and-rob-lee-about-counteroffensive-and-wagner\">Geopolitics Decanted podcast</a>, Mike Kofman and Rob Lee explored a hypothetical situation: if NATO troops found themselves in a similar predicament as the Ukrainians, that is, without air superiority, how well would they fare against Russian defense lines? They concluded that NATO troops would only perform marginally better. The task is just *that* hard.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>I remain excited about GSLDBs (another a bit longer range PGM). From my perspective, based on how Ukraine is utilizing Storm Shadows, it seems that at least half of the Shadow&#39;s targets could be serviced by GLSDBs (various hotels/retreats full of Russian soldiers on vacation in Ukraine).</p>\n</div>",
