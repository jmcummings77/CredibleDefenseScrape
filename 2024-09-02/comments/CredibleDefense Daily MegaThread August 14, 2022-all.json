        "body": "*With New Weaponry, Ukraine Is Subtly Shifting Its War Strategy. Striking deep behind enemy lines, the Ukrainians are depleting Russia\u2019s combat potential, slowing its advance in the east and creating new vulnerabilities in the south.*\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/13/world/europe/ukraine-russia-himars-kherson.html\n\nBy Marc Santora, Michael Schwirtz and Jack Nicas Aug. 13, 2022 Updated 2:04 p.m. ET\n\nKYIV, Ukraine \u2014 From spring into summer, the Ukrainian military was pummeled by Russian artillery in eastern Ukraine, steadily losing ground and as many as 200 soldiers a day in a mismatched, head-to-head contest. But in recent weeks, Ukraine has shifted its strategy with the help of new weaponry and succeeded, at least for now, in slowing Russia\u2019s advances.\n\nSupplied with a growing arsenal of long-range Western weapons and aided by local fighters known as partisans, Ukraine has been able to hit Russian forces deep behind enemy lines, disrupting critical supply lines and, increasingly, striking targets that are key to Moscow\u2019s combat potential.\n\nThe new weapons have also forced Russia to recalibrate on the battlefield, creating some breathing room for the Ukrainians to make more strategic decisions.\n\nOne blow to the Russians this week was a series of explosions at an air base on the occupied Crimean Peninsula that destroyed at least eight warplanes, and that a Ukrainian official said had resulted from a strike carried out by special forces troops aided by local partisan fighters.\n\nThe approach has been particularly well suited to the Kherson region in the south, where for weeks Ukrainian officials have been engaged in the opening salvos of a counteroffensive. The city of Kherson in particular, dependent for supplies on just four bridges spanning the Dnipro River, is considered more vulnerable than other occupied cities.\n\nOn Saturday, the Ukrainians claimed to have hit the last of those four key bridges, leaving thousands of Russian troops in danger of becoming isolated and cut off from resupply, according to Western intelligence officials.\n\n\u201cWe do not have the resources to litter the territory with bodies and shells, as Russia does,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s defense minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said in an interview this past week with Pravda, a Ukrainian news media outlet. \u201cTherefore it is necessary to change tactics, to fight in a different way.\u201d\n\nThe strategy seems to be producing some results. While the Ukrainian military has not made major territorial gains, it has managed to slow the Russian advance across the country, for now, at least, and stanch the heavy losses Ukraine was suffering in recent months, which had led to wavering morale and some soldiers even deserting their platoons.\n\nBut the Russians have continued to apply pressure in the east and the south on Ukrainian frontline positions, with some that are slowly buckling. The incremental advances have indicated that despite setbacks from Ukraine\u2019s attacks, the Russian military effort still has enough forces to continue offensive operations.\n\nUkraine\u2019s efforts in the south represent less a change in approach than an extension, with the aid of new longer-range weapons, of a strategy adopted at the start of the war meant to level the playing field with Russia. With the Russian army far outmatching Ukraine\u2019s forces in the number of troops, weapons and ammunition, Ukraine\u2019s military has had to be innovative and nimble.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear the Ukrainians can\u2019t match the Russians unit for unit and soldier for soldier. And Ukraine, like the Russians, is running out of soldiers,\u201d said Samuel Bendett, a Russian weapons analyst at the Center for Naval Analysis. \u201cSo Ukraine has to be very judicial in how they draw out the Russian forces.\u201d\n\nUkraine successfully repelled Russia\u2019s efforts to seize the capital, Kyiv, using smaller, adaptable fighting units that exploited its home-field advantage for lightning attacks on Russian forces, which were concentrated in large lumbering columns that made easy targets.\n\nIn the east, with its wide, rolling plains, Russia initially was able to take advantage of its superiority in numbers and firepower, wearing down the Ukrainian troops with relentless artillery barrages before moving to seize territory.\n\nBut now, supplied with new longer-range artillery pieces, like the American-made High Mobility Artillery Rocket System or HIMARS, Ukraine has been able to slow Russia\u2019s advance and divert some attention to what Ukraine\u2019s generals see as more advantageous territory in the south.\n\nIt is there, particularly in the Kherson region, which was the first region of Ukraine lost to Russian forces, that Ukraine hopes it can begin to turn the tide of the war. Using HIMARS and other long-range weapons, Ukrainian forces have slowly chipped away at Russia\u2019s ability to supply troops holding territory west of the Dnipro River, including the city of Kherson, which Russian forces have controlled since the first weeks of the war.\n\nSerhii Khlan, an adviser to the head of the Kherson region\u2019s military administration, said on Facebook that the destruction of the final remaining bridge over the Dnipro River on Saturday was part of Ukraine\u2019s strategy to frustrate the Russian forces.\n\n\u201cOf course, they will try to repair, look for an alternative in the crossings,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is time, money, and then as soon as they prepare and gain equipment and strength \u2014 we will destroy it again.\u201d\n\nThe idea, according to Ukrainian commanders, is to make conditions so untenable that Russia withdraws across the Dnipro on its own in the face of the expected Ukrainian counterattack.\n\n\u201cOur soldiers are inventive and progressive, while the Russians are working by the book, deploying battle formations as it was laid out in the Soviet Union,\u201d Vitaliy Kim, the head of the Mykolaiv region\u2019s military administration, said in an interview last week. \u201cOur guys have read this book and understand it perfectly well, and are using it for their own goals.\u201d\n\nIn eastern Ukraine, the main Russian effort is now focused on trying to gain ground in the Donetsk region, and there has been intense fighting in recent days in the area around the town of Pisky. Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said on Saturday that the town had fallen, a claim that could not be independently verified.\n\nThe Ukrainian way, as is becoming more apparent by the day, is to carry out strikes that undermine Moscow\u2019s ability to sustain the forces it has deployed at the front.\n\n\u201cWe look for the weak points of the Russians, determine the critical points of the enemy and gradually bleed them,\u201d Andrii Ryzhenk, a former top Ukrainian military official who is now an adviser at the Center for Defense Strategies, a Ukrainian think tank, said this month.\n\nWhile the approach has been aided by the long-range Western weapons, it has also been encouraged by Western officials. Mr. Reznikov, Ukraine\u2019s defense minister, said this week that the American and British defense ministers had both offered him a piece of advice: \u201cThe Russians use meat-grinder tactics \u2014 if you plan to fight them with the same tactics, we will not be able to help you.\u201d\n\nCritical to Russia\u2019s efforts to hold onto land in Ukraine\u2019s south is Moscow\u2019s control over Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014. Before its full-scale invasion of Ukraine early this year, Moscow sent tens of thousands of soldiers to the peninsula, and they captured large swaths of the southern regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia within days.\n\nSince then, rail lines from Crimea have been critical in enabling Moscow to move heavy weapons and equipment into southern Ukraine. Last week, Britain\u2019s Defense Intelligence Agency said that the Ukrainians had hit a key railroad line from the peninsula, making it \u201chighly unlikely the rail link connecting Kherson with Crimea remains operational.\u201d\n\nThe Russians are likely to race to repair it, the agency said, but the attack underscored a critical vulnerability.\n\nThe southern theater is now essentially cut in two \u2014 divided by the Dnipro River \u2014 and the British intelligence agency said that even if Russia managed to make significant repairs to the bridges that Ukrainian forces have hit, the structures would remain a potential weak spot.",

Using HIMARS and other long-range weapons, Ukrainian forces have slowly chipped away at Russia\u2019s ability to supply troops holding territory west of the Dnipro River, including the city of Kherson, which Russian forces have controlled since the first weeks of the war.</p>\n\n<p>Serhii Khlan, an adviser to the head of the Kherson region\u2019s military administration, said on Facebook that the destruction of the final remaining bridge over the Dnipro River on Saturday was part of Ukraine\u2019s strategy to frustrate the Russian forces.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOf course, they will try to repair, look for an alternative in the crossings,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is time, money, and then as soon as they prepare and gain equipment and strength \u2014 we will destroy it again.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The idea, according to Ukrainian commanders, is to make conditions so untenable that Russia withdraws across the Dnipro on its own in the face of the expected Ukrainian counterattack.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOur soldiers are inventive and progressive, while the Russians are working by the book, deploying battle formations as it was laid out in the Soviet Union,\u201d Vitaliy Kim, the head of the Mykolaiv region\u2019s military administration, said in an interview last week. \u201cOur guys have read this book and understand it perfectly well, and are using it for their own goals.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In eastern Ukraine, the main Russian effort is now focused on trying to gain ground in the Donetsk region, and there has been intense fighting in recent days in the area around the town of Pisky. Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said on Saturday that the town had fallen, a claim that could not be independently verified.</p>\n\n<p>The Ukrainian way, as is becoming more apparent by the day, is to carry out strikes that undermine Moscow\u2019s ability to sustain the forces it has deployed at the front.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe look for the weak points of the Russians, determine the critical points of the enemy and gradually bleed them,\u201d Andrii Ryzhenk, a former top Ukrainian military official who is now an adviser at the Center for Defense Strategies, a Ukrainian think tank, said this month.</p>\n\n<p>While the approach has been aided by the long-range Western weapons, it has also been encouraged by Western officials. Mr. Reznikov, Ukraine\u2019s defense minister, said this week that the American and British defense ministers had both offered him a piece of advice: \u201cThe Russians use meat-grinder tactics \u2014 if you plan to fight them with the same tactics, we will not be able to help you.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Critical to Russia\u2019s efforts to hold onto land in Ukraine\u2019s south is Moscow\u2019s control over Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014. Before its full-scale invasion of Ukraine early this year, Moscow sent tens of thousands of soldiers to the peninsula, and they captured large swaths of the southern regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia within days.</p>\n\n<p>Since then, rail lines from Crimea have been critical in enabling Moscow to move heavy weapons and equipment into southern Ukraine. Last week, Britain\u2019s Defense Intelligence Agency said that the Ukrainians had hit a key railroad line from the peninsula, making it \u201chighly unlikely the rail link connecting Kherson with Crimea remains operational.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The Russians are likely to race to repair it, the agency said, but the attack underscored a critical vulnerability.</p>\n\n<p>The southern theater is now essentially cut in two \u2014 divided by the Dnipro River \u2014 and the British intelligence agency said that even if Russia managed to make significant repairs to the bridges that Ukrainian forces have hit, the structures would remain a potential weak spot.</p>\n</div>",

Right now Ukraine has too few HIMARS to really focus on it, but what if they have double the HIMARS and can actually see how well NATO counter for Soviet artillery works in practice?</li>\n<li>even if that plan fails, in a somewhat longer term, between HIMARS destroying (too expensive to replace) Russian AA, and F-16s coming, Russian artillery will not be happy</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",

With the Russian and NATO confronting each other in the Mediterranean, often reaching very close distances. And that three weeks ago saw the Moscow ships carry out a very daring operation: they positioned themselves in order to block the Adriatic and obstruct the American aircraft carrier \u201cTruman\u201d. A strategic move: this is the sea closest to the battlefields of Ukraine , the one from which missiles and airplanes can in theory intervene most quickly on the battle line.\n\nOn July 22, the \u201cAmmiraglio Tributs\u201d destroyer passed the Otranto and climbed further north: it went beyond the Gargano and settled off the coast of Abruzzo, crowded for the summer holidays. She wasn't alone. The cruiser \u201cVaryag\u201d followed him, with her long-range missile batteries: she stayed in front of the Salento, keeping the key passage for the Adriatic at gunpoint with her radars. Together with him a third unit, the \u201cVasily Tatishchev\u201d: a spy boat, with instruments to intercept radio communications and sensor pulses. His job was to study NATO's \"electronic reactions\" to the raid.\n\nFor the first time in the Adriatic\n\nSince the beginning of the war, the Russian fleet had never entered the Adriatic. Several times the ships of Moscow have moved to closely monitor - \"shade\" as they say in technical jargon - the exercises of the Atlantic Alliance, reaching as far as the waters of Calabria. But they had never dared a \"blocking maneuver\", designed to limit the movements of the American aircraft carrier \"Truman\", the flagship of the NATO deployment in the Mediterranean which in recent months often moves along a route from Sicily to the Adriatic.\n\nThe initiative of the Russian Navy opened a long duel, with NATO commands committed to demonstrating that they would not give up control of the passage between the Ionian and the Adriatic. Thus in the last days of July the cruiser \u201cVaryag\u201d found itself less than one hundred kilometers from the American counterpart \u201cForrest Sherman\u201d: they were practically on both sides of the cape of Santa Maria di Leuca. The Russians on the Adriatic side, the Americans on the Ionian side. A little further south, the \u201cTruman\u201d aircraft carrier, with nearly sixty F18 Hornet fighter-bombers and a US Navy escort. In between, a NATO team - the Standing Maritime Group Two - with American, Italian, Spanish, Turkish and Greek destroyers and frigates that on 25 July gathered in the Ionian to make a square around the \u201cTruman\u201d. The Russian operation between Puglia and Sicily\n\nThe Russian operation was revealed by the site \u201cThe Ship Yard Naval Consultancy\u201d, which analyzes information from commercial satellites, and confirmed to Repubblica by official sources. But the missions of some scouts - highlighted by the Itamilradar site - had indicated that something was happening between Sicily and Puglia. In particular, on 31 July one of the great American spy drones GlobalHawk, which daily take off from Sigonella to head to the Black Sea and monitor the Ukrainian conflict, patrolled a stretch of the Ionian for hours and hours, continuing to fly over a specific area: the same where in the previous three days, searches for Italian P72 aircraft had been concentrated.\n\nIt is not known what the current position of the Russian ships is and whether their activity was also accompanied by a submarine. Yesterday, however, the Italian reconnaissance aircraft returned to garrison the waters between Calabria and Greece, insisting on some positions: there is a suspicion that at least one of the units is still in the area. The cruiser \"Varyag\" is the twin of the \"Moskva\" sunk by the Ukrainians on April 14: it is one of the most powerful ships in Putin's fleet, with sixteen long-range P-1000 Vulcan missiles designed to destroy American aircraft carriers, acting together - according to Russian propaganda - \u201clike a pack of wolves pouncing on its prey\u201d. They can strike 500 kilometers away, traveling at three times the speed of sound. Compared to the \u201cMoskva\u201d, the \u201cVaryag\u201d would have more advanced anti-aircraft and radar defenses.\n\nInstead \"Admiral Tributs\" is a great destroyer for the fight against submarines, also equipped with missiles designed to shoot down US cruise ships. The two ships, launched at the sunset of the USSR and subjected to modernization several times, are a permanent couple in the Pacific fleet, of which the \"Varyag\" is the flagship: they set sail last December from Vladivostok, the port facing Japan , and they crossed the oceans to strengthen the deployment in the Mediterranean in view of the invasion of Ukraine. Since then they have formed the Russian \"attack point\" that moves from Syria to the West to pursue the Atlantic Alliance, alternating with the other team formed by the \"Slava\" cruiser, a destroyer, two frigates and a corvette.\n\nFinally, at least two \u201cKilo\u201d class submarines - very quiet and armed with Kalibr missiles - are carrying out solitary expeditions near the Bosphorus. Duels that are limited to maneuvers, more or less aggressive, and exchanges of radar impulses, to indicate the ability to hit opponents: wargames that over the months are becoming more frequent and tightened. A few days ago, a strategic document from the Kremlin reiterated the importance of the Eastern Mediterranean routes for Russia's \"national interest\": the goal that pushes Putin's admirals to unleash a new, high-tension Cold War more and more often in the Italian sea.\n\nTranslation and original post by u/BkkGrl on r/Europe\n\nEdit: Replaced translation error.",

A little further south, the \u201cTruman\u201d aircraft carrier, with nearly sixty F18 Hornet fighter-bombers and a US Navy escort. In between, a NATO team - the Standing Maritime Group Two - with American, Italian, Spanish, Turkish and Greek destroyers and frigates that on 25 July gathered in the Ionian to make a square around the \u201cTruman\u201d. The Russian operation between Puglia and Sicily</p>\n\n<p>The Russian operation was revealed by the site \u201cThe Ship Yard Naval Consultancy\u201d, which analyzes information from commercial satellites, and confirmed to Repubblica by official sources. But the missions of some scouts - highlighted by the Itamilradar site - had indicated that something was happening between Sicily and Puglia. In particular, on 31 July one of the great American spy drones GlobalHawk, which daily take off from Sigonella to head to the Black Sea and monitor the Ukrainian conflict, patrolled a stretch of the Ionian for hours and hours, continuing to fly over a specific area: the same where in the previous three days, searches for Italian P72 aircraft had been concentrated.</p>\n\n<p>It is not known what the current position of the Russian ships is and whether their activity was also accompanied by a submarine. Yesterday, however, the Italian reconnaissance aircraft returned to garrison the waters between Calabria and Greece, insisting on some positions: there is a suspicion that at least one of the units is still in the area. The cruiser &quot;Varyag&quot; is the twin of the &quot;Moskva&quot; sunk by the Ukrainians on April 14: it is one of the most powerful ships in Putin&#39;s fleet, with sixteen long-range P-1000 Vulcan missiles designed to destroy American aircraft carriers, acting together - according to Russian propaganda - \u201clike a pack of wolves pouncing on its prey\u201d. They can strike 500 kilometers away, traveling at three times the speed of sound. Compared to the \u201cMoskva\u201d, the \u201cVaryag\u201d would have more advanced anti-aircraft and radar defenses.</p>\n\n<p>Instead &quot;Admiral Tributs&quot; is a great destroyer for the fight against submarines, also equipped with missiles designed to shoot down US cruise ships. The two ships, launched at the sunset of the USSR and subjected to modernization several times, are a permanent couple in the Pacific fleet, of which the &quot;Varyag&quot; is the flagship: they set sail last December from Vladivostok, the port facing Japan , and they crossed the oceans to strengthen the deployment in the Mediterranean in view of the invasion of Ukraine. Since then they have formed the Russian &quot;attack point&quot; that moves from Syria to the West to pursue the Atlantic Alliance, alternating with the other team formed by the &quot;Slava&quot; cruiser, a destroyer, two frigates and a corvette.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, at least two \u201cKilo\u201d class submarines - very quiet and armed with Kalibr missiles - are carrying out solitary expeditions near the Bosphorus. Duels that are limited to maneuvers, more or less aggressive, and exchanges of radar impulses, to indicate the ability to hit opponents: wargames that over the months are becoming more frequent and tightened. A few days ago, a strategic document from the Kremlin reiterated the importance of the Eastern Mediterranean routes for Russia&#39;s &quot;national interest&quot;: the goal that pushes Putin&#39;s admirals to unleash a new, high-tension Cold War more and more often in the Italian sea.</p>\n\n<p>Translation and original post by <a href=\"/u/BkkGrl\">u/BkkGrl</a> on <a href=\"/r/Europe\">r/Europe</a></p>\n\n<p>Edit: Replaced translation error.</p>\n</div>",

So your definition is cute, but what if I just say Ukraine doesn't win even if they restore Feb 24?  And yet, clearly there's plenty left to fight over, so arguing over the definition of victory and defeat isn't productive.\n\nInstead, it's more productive to acknowledge that neither victory nor defeat is total and looking at individual war goals.  Because that way we're talking about something objective - how close is a war goal to victory or failure? \n\nAnd Russia has war goals of taking territory, including at minimum the territory in the Donbas.  In the context of this conversation, we're talking about the progress of that war goal - Russia's capacity to take territory.  \n\nYou claim we predicted that capacity would be damaged as the Donbas offensive progresses - it clearly was, most notably after the fall of Lysychansk, after which point Russia made few if any advances for a while and to this day has yet to achieve operational.\n\nRussia's capacity to take territory was severely damaged in the phase 2 offensive, as predicted.  They tried to repair that capacity and are testing it against Bakhmut right now.  So far they're yet to demonstrate that capacity has returned.\n\nSo of all the bad predictions made in this sub, you chose one that is actually pretty consistent with reality thus far.  Which you would already know if you followed the conflict nearly as ardently as you claim.",
