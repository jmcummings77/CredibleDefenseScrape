He has even publicly called for making them a pariah state.  Not exactly the way you treat an ally and then expect them do do you a favor that costs them a lot of money.\n\nThis was a big foreign policy mistake by the US.  Oil is still, and will be for at least a couple more decades, a massively valuable and strategically important commodity.

It is a choice between Krim or Kherson, and they will not risk Krim. There are in fact reports (and other informations) that already, some forces from Nova Khakova were relocated to fortify new defensive lines for Krim in Chaplynka: https://twitter.com/novakakhovka\\_ua/status/1578419388566622208\n\nIn my view, the current north Kherson line is untenable - they cannot maintain an indefinite defense dependent so much on Borozenske and Bruskynske, with flanking risk from Chkalove as well. As such, it is likely they will withdraw via Nova Kakhovka, albeit with delaying action dragged out as long as possible. There is also the possibility that 1/2 of their north Kherson forces (or some other ratio) will be withdrawn over the Inhulets River (instead of Nova Kakhovka), in effect \"doubling down on Kherson\", but I believe this only adds excessive risk to Krim, and will not be done, unless for extreme political reasons.\n\nFor the threat to Krim from the Melitopol direction, I believe Russia knows the risk at Vasylivka. From what I know, there is a good defense group there, especially in the triangle of Vasylivka - Pology - Tokmak. It likely has in total 5 brigades now (eg. from 19th Motor Rifle Division). Any officers from this region can correct me, I am not fully certain of the numbers.\n\nThis forms the hypothesis that the main projection risk to Krim is in fact Nova Kakhovka: in the direction of Kalanchak/Chaplynka, but also for initial access to the P47 artery. The Melitopol direction is indeed big risk too, but from what we know, RU has a good defense group in that area, and it is not (yet) critical. \n\nI don't believe the Antonovsky bridge is a factor - it will be blown by RU if necessary. For the dam however, I do not believe they will completely destroy it. As long as they don't, there are ways to leverage it, making containing a Nova Kakhovka bridgehead and building layered defenses (as in Chaplynka) absolutely critical for Krim. For historical reference, you can observe a similar action from WW2 Germany in August 1941: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fe9o7vDX0AEdPW0?format=jpg&name=large",

In the last two to three days, we've seen at least three strong arguments for a ceasefire from members of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a think tank based in Washington but with a strong presence in Russia. Before anyone gets into it, yes, Bill Burns, the current CIA Director, did lead the Carnegie Endowment after he retired in 2014 up until his appointment in 2020. No, it does not mean that the Carnegie Endowment is a CIA front, the two things are unconnected. Burns took the job at Carnegie because he was a well-respected diplomat.  \n\n\nMoving on, Alexander Gabuev, former Kommersant reporter/editor and expert on Russia-Asia relations who is now a Senior Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment (and who fled Russia at the start of the war), posted an article in the Financial Times on the 11th about how an immediate ceasfire was needed because the risks of nuclear war were so high. Today, a transcript of a podcast between Gideon Rachman and Gabuev appeared in FT, in which Gabuev reasserted his belief that this is heading towards nuclear war and the only way to stop the train is to force an immediate ceasefire. Also today, in Foreign Policy published an op-ed from two more Carnegie Endowment folks, Ariel Levite (a respected Israeli nuclear policy expert who worked in both the Israeli government and MoD in addition to lots of think tanks) and George Perkovich (long-time think tanker and US government advisor), in which they also advocated for an immediate ceasefire.   \n\n\nIt doesn't stop there however. Another Carnegie scholar, Tatiana Stanovoya, put out a tweet today saying that Russian elites see no way out of this except nuclear use. Another connection, Jeremy Shaprio, who published the article on the 12th on War on the Rocks about how we are on the path to nuclear war unless we stop the conflict is the Director of the European Council on Foreign Relations, where Alexander Gabuev also worked.   \n\n\nBefore going all Charlie Day here (CAROL?!?), I think that this is a very strange trend that suddenly this group of experts, all connected, are coming out so strongly for a ceasefire within a short period. I can't help but feel like it's connected, especially the Gabuev, Levite, and Perkovich pieces. I'm not sure what to make of it. Is it a disinfo op? Do these people know something we don't (they do obviously have a connection to the CIA Director, after all)? Has Carnegie Endowment simply decided on the line they want to run for all commentary about Ukraine now? It's just all a little too coordinated in terms of narrative to ignore imo.",

Large amounts of data have been stolen and sent to a server in the US.\n\n> The agency handles information on both sensitive companies and Swedish hunters.\n\n\n\nOn 1 October, the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency was granted the status of an emergency authority. This means that the government has classified it as particularly important for society's crisis preparedness and overall defence - and when the government convenes the Crisis Management Council in response to the external situation, the Agency is one of the authorities.\n\nFour days later, the data breach against the agency was discovered, which may be one of the largest known cyber-attacks against the Swedish state to date.\n\nThat a breach had taken place became clear on Wednesday last week, as DN has previously reported. Antivirus software had then alerted that malware had been found somewhere in the authority's IT systems. Such alerts are not uncommon, but when the log files were examined, something much worse was discovered: large amounts of data had been stolen from the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nThe Agency immediately shut down its IT systems in an attempt to minimise the damage. More than a week later, they have still not been restarted.\n\nAccording to H\u00e5kan Svaleryd, head of the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency's administrative department, the breach was extensive.\n\n- A large amount of information from the agency has been copied.\n\nWhat does \"large quantities\" mean?\n\n- We have large amounts of data at the agency. A lot of it has been copied and we have seen it leave the Agency and end up on a server in the USA.\n\n\nDo you consider this to be a targeted attack on the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency?\n\n- In any case, this does not seem to have struck widely against authorities in Sweden. We have not heard of anyone else being affected.\n\nThe fact that the systems are still closed is due to fears of what might happen when the systems are restarted. Employees cannot access their e-mail or file servers. Some e-services for the public are down.\n\nThere is growing frustration among staff at the agency. Several employees tell DN that they are worried, both about what has happened and that it is practically difficult to work.\n\n- We are working on trying to reopen the systems by the end of the week. There is feverish activity, but there is still uncertainty in the forecast. We are trying to adjust as best we can and do other things that need to be done anyway,\" says H\u00e5kan Svaleryd.\n\nIt is not known who is behind the cyber attack. Neither is it known whether it is a cyber criminal or a foreign state actor.\n\nAccording to the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, there is so far no evidence that information has been deleted or altered. This is otherwise common after data breaches against companies and public authorities, when they are carried out with so-called extortion viruses, or \"ransomware\" in English. One high-profile case was when hackers took control of computers in Kalix municipality last winter. All files were encrypted - the computers became virtually unusable. The attackers demanded a ransom to unlock the files, money to be paid in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.\n\nIt is still unknown what information was contained in the large amount of data stolen from the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency. Most of the information handled there is public, but there are parts that are covered by confidentiality. For example, data on companies that manufacture and handle chemicals and reports on hazardous waste and emissions.\n\nThe agency also maintains an extensive register of hunters, including personal data and data on registered hunting licences and hunting qualifications. In addition, there are employees with security clearances.\n\n- Attacks on Swedish authorities are a regular occurrence. The majority are intercepted by our protection systems. This has got in and we don't really know how.\n\nHave you received ransom demands?\n\n- I'm afraid I can't answer that.\n\nThe data breach has been reported to the police. A preliminary investigation is underway and is being handled by the Complex Cybercrime Unit of the Stockholm Police.\n\n- The investigation is confidential. We can't comment,\" says \u00c5sa Sk\u00f6ldberg.\n\n         Further context: \n         The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency is a government agency that manages and coordinates Sweden's environmental work. It has around 750 employees working in offices in Stockholm and \u00d6stersund.\n\n         Last week it was reported that the agency's IT system is down after a data breach. A week later, the systems are still down.\n\n\n\n***Translated with DeepL.***\n\nEdit: formatting is a bit wonky \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af",

He said the system also is still experiencing too many failures of essential functions.\n\n>The problems found in the testing in May and June were outlined in a 79-page report this month. The Army marked it \u201cControlled Unclassified Information\u201d to prevent public distribution, but Bloomberg News obtained a summary.\n\n>Despite the device\u2019s flaws, Guertin doesn\u2019t deem it a lost cause.

The retreat/rout/good will gesture in the north of the salient probably helped the defense by shortening both the LOC and the supply distance, but the new LOC lacks some of the defensive advantages of the lost towns- How many times did the Russians spank the marines trying to take Davydid Brid?-  And the loss of backfield has made Russian artillery all the more vulnerable (how can you shoot and scoot, if there's nowhere to scoot?).  \n\nDoes anyone see anything other than continued attrition warfare? I don't see things changing until the river gets cold enough for partial freezing- Once the ferries stop running, the supply problem will go from bad to catastrophic. \nOn the other hand, the freeze/thaw cycle is going to make most of the area off paved roads impassable to almost every vehicle type, making even local attacks doubtful.
