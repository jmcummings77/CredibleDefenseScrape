What's surprising though is that he claims the fighting conducted by LDPR forces elsewhere in the Donbas in support of the push to take Bakhmut have been as costly as the previous battles for Mariupol and Volnovakha, which caused huge losses for separatist forces. He also suggests that LDPR units (outside of artillery and command) have been chewed to hell and reconstituted repeatedly by mobiks from the separatist regions with no training and terrible equipment, in some units as many as 4 times already, and that as a result their combat effectiveness is \"below the floor.\" Working vehicles are also supposedly very rare in these units at this point. \n\nIf this is true (and it does seem very plausible), it suggests that the Russian strategy is highly unsustainable as the losses among ground units are enormous and their replacements are far less capable than the men being lost. It would also suggest that once Russia really does run out of expendable \"meat\" like LDPR and Wagner convicts, that these tactics won't work anymore as Russian mobiks are unlikely to allow themselves to die in sufficient quantities the same way convicts or separatist mobiks are. Murz himself makes this last point and thinks a lot of people who will celebrate the coming capture of Bakhmut will soon be wringing their hands and asking \"how is this possible\" when the next Ukrainian offensive is successful just the same as happened previously in Kherson and Kharkiv.",

The milblogger also made a sexist remark that Russian women are making emotional appeals and urged them to refrain from complaining about their husbands\u2019 problems.

The milblogger downplayed reports of poor frontline conditions, noting that these conditions are solely the fault of local commanders.

However, starting from October, President Biden reduced the shipments of precision-guided munitions (PGMs), and since then Ukraine's fortunes evaporated. The US seems to be ramping up PGM shipments yet again, and Ukraine should gradually start doing better.

Do you actually think that there wouldn't be any exclusions and that countries can just shoot down whatever the hell they want?\n\nFor the record you need to look at [annex 2](https://www.icao.int/Meetings/anconf12/Document%20Archive/an02_cons%5B1%5D.pdf) 'rules of the air', not the main document.\n\nLet's take a pertinent example and look at appendix 4 'unmanned free balloons'\n\n- 2.1 An unmanned free balloon shall not be operated\nwithout appropriate authorization from the State from which\nthe launch is made.\n\n- 2.2 An unmanned free balloon, other than a light balloon\nused exclusively for meteorological purposes and operated in\nthe manner prescribed by the appropriate authority, shall not\nbe operated across the territory of another State without\nappropriate authorization from the other State concerned.\n\n- 2.3 The authorization referred to in 2.2 shall be obtained\nprior to the launching of the balloon **if there is reasonable\nexpectation, when planning the operation, that the balloon may\ndrift into airspace over the territory of another State.** Such\nauthorization may be obtained for a series of balloon flights or\nfor a particular type of recurring flight, e.g. atmospheric\nresearch balloon flights.\n\nI say this is pertinent because the exclusion I've highlighted is the exact one the Chinese government were relying on in their public statements. This exclusion applies to balloons being legally allowed to traverse territory without prior authorisation if they ave encountered 'unexpected' conditions.\n\nYou can of course shoot it down (you can do whatever you want) but you could be taken to court and lose the case. \n\n> Where does the document you cited say that states do not have the right to shoot down unmanned vehicles over their sovereign territory.\n\nI didn't say unmanned vehicle. You appear to be putting words in my mouth. For the record a country can happily shoot down any manned vehicle they choose to. They are after all sovereign. But that would be to ignore the point of treaties and the fact that there would be potentially severe consequences.\n\nThe term used was 'unidentified object'.

If Switzerland were a North African country instead, it would not be treated as a friend to Europe with the way it acts. </p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s why i argue that europe should stop treating it like it&#39;s a friend. It&#39;s not a friend. It may be economically beneficial, but case in point, if Switzerland is so self interested and neutral all the time, that the money you send there may even be used against your interests; then it&#39;s worth closing the border and building the factories and offices in Germany, Austria, etc instead.</p>\n</div>",

Videos are better because at least they show context, but when a largely unedited video gets released we're not going to know what happened, because the edited ones are just propaganda.\n\nWhat is known is that the UAF had drones up in strength when the attack happened, which likely means their arty was already starting to fall, defenses were likely activating with plenty of warning, etc.\n\nTypically, during a combined arms breach, engineer AFV lead the way. Did that happen here? We don't know. Maybe they failed to plan and didn't use them. Maybe they didn't have them. Maybe they were already destroyed, but the show goes on. Maybe they already cleared those lanes previously or thought they were still clear (hence why I brought up scatterable mines) so the Russian assault element wasn't supposed to hit mines. \n\nEither way, they run into mines and engineers aren't immediately available. Do they turn back and their part of a brigade to division sized attack doesn't happen? Park and wait for engineers to show up, waiting for UAF arty to land on them? Or try to find gaps in the minefield if they exist by driving through? \n\nThe US Army had done that plenty of times in WW2, and while it is costly it also often does finds gaps to exit the minefield. And most of all it does it quickly, which is a necessity when they're being shot at.\n\nGo watch what the Army [thinks a combined arms breach should look like](https://youtu.be/ZZ-sCT_maAQ)\n\nThey have engineer vehicles alone in front on point trying to clear mines in a way that would take much longer in real life (in ODS that took sometimes between 2-6 hours). In the video nobody is shooting at them with anything, especially artillery, because the acronym for breaching includes an S for suppression, so they won't show that in their doctrinal video. Plus it would make for a chaotic video after they have to explain what to do when the engineering vehicles explode. Because there is no way to totally suppress the entirety of enemy defensive fires unless they suck. And any accurate defensive fire changes things immensely, especially since engineering vehicles are typically the first targeted. \n\nSo to work, the defensive line and all their arty has to be suppressed. If it's not fully suppressed, incoming fire has to be light and inaccurate, or the engineers have no hope to do their job. \n\nRussians didn't suppress UAF in Vulhedar, especially didn't manage to shut down their drones with EW. That alone would likely mean the attack would fail. \n\nThe one thing I'm not seeing is Russian tanks with mine plows or mine rollers. However, I'm not even sure how well the former works when the ground is frozen, and the latter only identifies minefields, it's not meant to get through them.",

And most of all it does it quickly, which is a necessity when they&#39;re being shot at.</p>\n\n<p>Go watch what the Army <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ZZ-sCT_maAQ\">thinks a combined arms breach should look like</a></p>\n\n<p>They have engineer vehicles alone in front on point trying to clear mines in a way that would take much longer in real life (in ODS that took sometimes between 2-6 hours). In the video nobody is shooting at them with anything, especially artillery, because the acronym for breaching includes an S for suppression, so they won&#39;t show that in their doctrinal video. Plus it would make for a chaotic video after they have to explain what to do when the engineering vehicles explode. Because there is no way to totally suppress the entirety of enemy defensive fires unless they suck. And any accurate defensive fire changes things immensely, especially since engineering vehicles are typically the first targeted. </p>\n\n<p>So to work, the defensive line and all their arty has to be suppressed. If it&#39;s not fully suppressed, incoming fire has to be light and inaccurate, or the engineers have no hope to do their job. </p>\n\n<p>Russians didn&#39;t suppress UAF in Vulhedar, especially didn&#39;t manage to shut down their drones with EW. That alone would likely mean the attack would fail. </p>\n\n<p>The one thing I&#39;m not seeing is Russian tanks with mine plows or mine rollers. However, I&#39;m not even sure how well the former works when the ground is frozen, and the latter only identifies minefields, it&#39;s not meant to get through them.</p>\n</div>",

Taking Polohy rapidly with a large force and making it to Kamianka could force Russia to withdraw from the salient on Vulehdar's flank and offer a better battlefield to attack Mariupol sometime later. \n\nBerdyansk is the best first target for cutting off the Russian land bridge, due to lack of large urban areas that might blunt a Ukranian advance, good natural defenses on the east to blunt any counterattack, and the relative lack of russian focus on its defense (with majority of forces covering Mariupol and Melitopol direction).

US seems more willing to provide Bradley than Abrams and they have more manpower than vehicles so makes sense to utilise them for mechanised brigades instead of tank brigades.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, Ukrainian mechanised brigades consist of 3 mechanised infantry battalions, a tank battalion, a motorised infantry battalion, 2 self-propelled artillery battalions, a rocket artillery battalion, anti-tank artillery battalion and anti-aircraft missile artillery battalion.\n\nMechanised infantry and tank battalions could be combined in combined arms battalions with 3 mechanised infantry companies and a tank company.\nThe rocket artillery battalion (with BM-21) could be replaced by a self-propelled artillery battalion, increasing them to 3.\nThe anti-tank artillery battalion (with towed MT-12) could be replaced by a towed artillery battalion with 2 105mm M119/L119 batteries and a 155mm M777 battery.\n\nEquipping one such brigade would require 31 tanks, 93 IFVs, 54 SPGs, 12 105mm howitzers, 6 M777 howitzers, 31 APCs if they use 31 vehicles in a battalion.\n\nAnnounced aid currently includes 14 Challenger 2 and 35 Leopard 2, which can equip 1 brigade and some Leopard 1 could be used to boost that to 2 brigades. M1 Abrams should arrive much later and be enough for another brigade.\n\nIt includes 109 Bradley, 50 CV90 and 40 Marder, which can also equip 2 brigades.\nThere are about 163 SPGs delivered, which can equip 3 brigades, and more are being produced.\n\nA brigade equipped to US Army/Marine Corps/British Army level may also need platoon and company level jamming-resistant UAVs, 4,700 M4/M16/FN FNC/SCAR rifles, 900-1000 optics, laser sights and night vision devices, 4,700 of other personal equipment (boots, helmets, body armour, ballistic glasses, ear protection, backpacks, first aid kits, communication equipment), mine detectors and laser designators.\n\nDo you think this is likely to happen or should we expect them to continue combining donated heavy equipment and AK74 rifles with no rails and accessories, relying on donations for Mavic drones, tourniquets, sleeping bags, etc.?

            "body": "> For example, what's Chinese hardware output compared to the US? Is China building more ships than the US in an average year? Is China producing more fighter jets than the US in an average year?\n\nThe short answer is yes. The quality of Chinese capabilities may also be [closer](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/10ubw9x/credibledefense_daily_megathread_february_05_2023/j7faeg3/) to the US than what the layman might be aware of.\n\nThe slightly extended answer is that if we take these projections (for both quantity and quality) and do a linear extrapolation, it would seem that the Chinese navy *should* be bound to at least match the US navy within the next 2-3 decades, if not outright overtaking it.\n\nHowever, that's only assuming these factors remain constant. While I do personally lean towards the expectation that the PLAN will be a peer competitor to the USN for decades to come (even if Chinese economic growth plateaus/declines), it cannot be assumed that the state of US shipbuilding will remain static.\n\n- There is the potential, even if a minor one, that the US will pursue a major rearmament program that includes a focus on increasing domestic industrial capabilities. \n- Moreover, moves like the [export controls on high-end semiconductors](https://www.csis.org/analysis/seismic-shift-new-us-semiconductor-export-controls-and-implications-us-firms-allies-and) is expected to impact China's ambitions to leapfrog the US in certain cutting-edge sectors - particularly artificial intelligence.\n- Putting these factors together, this means that we could see a seesawing or push-and-pull relationship between the capabilities of the two powers (outside of anything obviously disruptive like a direct conflict with one another).\n\nSummary: In the coming decades, China will likely come extremely close to the US in both quantity and quality. But strategic moves from the US might just be able to maintain a gap in their respective capabilities. The question would then be how China responds/prepares. Thus, a more holistic take should also incorporate all the potential actions and counter-actions between the two behemoths.",

Self discipline means wanting to follow orders for various reasons, and having that is a mark of professionalism that many seek, especially since it's impossible to be a good soldier without it. But all real military discipline is always backed up by \"do this, or else,\" with the ability to legally perform a serious \"or else\" punishment to guarantee obedience. That doesn't need to mean death or corporal punishment, though in the worst times in military history those measures were often needed to maintain military discipline, especially after the conditions suffer to the point that morale suffers, which is part of the foundation for self discipline. \n\nThere definitely is a connection between disc and training, if nothing else the etymology, but less to do with actual job competence (which is more about professionalism and competence) and more to do with being taught to obey. \n\nThe Red Army actually did have a pretty decent long standing NCO corps right before WW2 (a carry over from Czarist army) and especially after WW2 through the 50s when it was still filled with Great Patriotic War veterans. But then when they reformed their military in the mid 50s with major personnel changes turning enlisted ranks into a conscript force they basically scrapped it. The most senior NCOs were made into warrant officers or retired, they commissioned the better junior NCOs and the rest of them plus long serving junior enlisted were kicked out as nearly all enlisted contractual positions (enlistments) were scrapped (Navy was a little different than Ground Forces). At that point all platoon level and below NCOs would be two year conscripts, with upper tier of initial training being identified and then given about 2-3 months of NCO training and made into sergeants while the privates they were with at the start went right to their unit. That was also when Soviet junior officers started taking a larger role performing duties that NCOs fulfill in other armies. And why Dedovshchina started, as the junior enlisted conscripts on their last six months were more respected and knowledgeable than the NCOs were and were unofficially empowered to help with discipline, especially in the barracks, which then morphed into a long term hazing ritual that they didn't break until the \"Grandfathers\" were abolished by making the term of service only one year (that's literally why it was cut in 2009). \n\nThe time period I'm referring to was during WW2. The Red Army discipline were slack on many things, they were slovenly, drunkenness was rampant and even encouraged with vodka ration, rape and plunder of non-combatants was often ignored, and their field discipline was atrocious. But they ruthlessly followed orders, were expected to be suicidally brave as policy, expected to work extremely hard like dogs, were expected to suffer far greater than most other armies, and no slack was given to those.",

The most senior NCOs were made into warrant officers or retired, they commissioned the better junior NCOs and the rest of them plus long serving junior enlisted were kicked out as nearly all enlisted contractual positions (enlistments) were scrapped (Navy was a little different than Ground Forces). At that point all platoon level and below NCOs would be two year conscripts, with upper tier of initial training being identified and then given about 2-3 months of NCO training and made into sergeants while the privates they were with at the start went right to their unit. That was also when Soviet junior officers started taking a larger role performing duties that NCOs fulfill in other armies. And why Dedovshchina started, as the junior enlisted conscripts on their last six months were more respected and knowledgeable than the NCOs were and were unofficially empowered to help with discipline, especially in the barracks, which then morphed into a long term hazing ritual that they didn&#39;t break until the &quot;Grandfathers&quot; were abolished by making the term of service only one year (that&#39;s literally why it was cut in 2009). </p>\n\n<p>The time period I&#39;m referring to was during WW2. The Red Army discipline were slack on many things, they were slovenly, drunkenness was rampant and even encouraged with vodka ration, rape and plunder of non-combatants was often ignored, and their field discipline was atrocious. But they ruthlessly followed orders, were expected to be suicidally brave as policy, expected to work extremely hard like dogs, were expected to suffer far greater than most other armies, and no slack was given to those.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "**Before We End Up In Wars With Russia And China Simultaneously, Let\u2019s Review The Nuclear Balance Of Power\u2026**\n\nhttp://themostimportantnews.com/archives/before-we-end-up-in-wars-with-russia-and-china-simultaneously-lets-review-the-nuclear-balance-of-power\n\nWhen I was growing up, I was taught that nobody would ever dare start a nuclear war because both sides would fire their missiles and everyone would die.  Unfortunately, the balance of power has changed dramatically over the past decade.  Russia and China have both made enormous leaps forward, and that puts us in a very precarious position.\n\nIn recent days, Republicans in Congress have been buzzing about a new report \u201cfrom the top commander of U.S. nuclear forces\u201d that says that China now has more launchers for land-based nuclear missiles than the U.S. does\u2026\n\n...\n\nFour GOP leaders on the House and Senate Armed Services committees said the revelation about China\u2019s nuclear capability, made in a Jan. 26 letter from the top commander of U.S. nuclear forces, is a warning that Beijing\u2019s arsenal is expanding faster than anticipated, though the U.S. still has more warheads and intercontinental ballistic missiles.\n\n\u201cThe [Chinese Communist Party] is rapidly expanding its nuclear capability. They have doubled their number of warheads in just 2 years,\u201d Rogers said at the outset of Tuesday\u2019s hearing. \u201cWe estimated it would take them a decade to do that.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Russians have developed a new intercontinental ballistic missile that is the most advanced in the world by a wide margin.  It is called \u201cthe Sarmat\u201d, and it is absolutely frightening.\n\nThe Sarmat is a three-stage, silo-based, liquid-fuel, heavy ICBM with a reported range of 18,000 kilometers. Dubbed \u201cSatan II\u201d by NATO, the missile is a Russian-built replacement of the Soviet-era SS-18 \u201cSatan\u201d ICBM, which is reaching the end of its life cycle. The Sarmat reportedly can carry a 10-ton payload consisting of 10-plus multiple independent reentry vehicles along with penetration aids used to evade missile defenses and can also carry several Avangard hypersonic glide vehicles.\n\nA single Sarmat can carry enough firepower to destroy an area the size of Texas.\n\nIf the Russians or the Chinese fire their missiles at us, can we shoot them down? The answer is no.\n\nIn fact, a study that was just released concluded that our anti-missile defenses are so feeble that we couldn\u2019t even do much \u201cto stop a relative handful of old-fashioned North Korean ICBMs\u201d from reaching their targets.\n\nA bit more than a month ago, a team of 13 physicists and engineers with the American Physical Society released a 54-page study exploring this very question, and they came to some disconcerting conclusions.\n\nUnfortunately, the Russians have been working very hard to develop very sophisticated anti-missile systems.\n\nUntil the S-500 was developed, the A-135 was the best system that the Russians had for intercepting intercontinental ballistic missiles\u2026\n\nThe A-135 was designed to intercept US intercontinental ballistic missiles as well as submarine-launched ballistic missiles. This anti-ballistic missile system has discrimination ability and can identify real re-entry vehicles from decoys and fake warheads.\n\nThe A-135 is superior to anything that we have, but it is far from perfect and now the S-500 is here.\n\nIt went into service last year, and there is no other system in the world that is even worth comparing to it.  The following information about the S-500 comes from Wikipedia\u2026\n\nThe S-500 is designed for intercepting and destroying intercontinental ballistic missiles, as well as hypersonic cruise missiles and aircraft, for air defense against Airborne Early Warning and Control and for jamming aircraft.[citation needed] With a planned range of 600 km (370 mi) for anti-ballistic missile (ABM) and 500 km (310 mi) for air defense,[22] the S-500 would be able to detect and simultaneously engage up to 10 ballistic hypersonic targets flying at a speed of 5 kilometres per second (3.1 mi/s)[23][24] to a limit of 7 km/s (4.3 mi/s).[25][26] It also aims at destroying hypersonic cruise missiles and other aerial targets at speeds of higher than Mach 5, as well as spacecraft. The altitude of a target engaged can be as high as 180\u2013200 km (110\u2013120 mi).[27] It is effective against ballistic missiles with a launch range of 3,500 km (2,200 mi), the radar reaches a radius of 3,000 km (1,300 km for the EPR 0,1 square meter).[28][29] Other targets it has been announced to defend against include unmanned aerial vehicles, low Earth orbit satellites, space weapons launched from hypersonic aircraft, and hypersonic orbital platforms.[30]\n\nThe system is mobile and has rapid deployability. Experts believe that the system\u2019s capabilities can affect enemy intercontinental ballistic missiles at the middle and end portions of flight,[22] but reports by Almaz-Antey say that the external target-designation system (RLS Voronezh-DM and missile defence system A-135 radar Don-2N) will be capable of mid-early flight portion interceptions of enemy ballistic missiles, which is one of the final stages of the S-500 project. It is to have a response time of less than 4 seconds (Compared to the S-400\u2019s less than 10).[31]\n\nSadly, the U.S. has not developed new land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles in decades.  At this point, the backbone of our land-based arsenal consists of just 400 extremely outdated Minuteman III missiles.  The following comes from the official website of the U.S. Department of Defense\u2026\n\nUp to 400 Minuteman III missiles make up the most responsive leg of the nuclear triad. America\u2019s ICBM force has remained on continuous, around-the-clock alert since 1959. The Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent program will begin the replacement of Minuteman III and modernization of the 450 ICBM launch facilities in 2029.\n\nIn 1970, the Minuteman III became the first deployed ICBM with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRV): three smaller warheads that improved the missile\u2019s ability to strike targets defended by ABMs.[8] They were initially armed with the W62 warhead with a yield of 170 kilotons.\n\nBy the 1970s, 1,000 Minuteman missiles were deployed. This force has shrunk to 400 Minuteman III missiles as of September 2017,[9] deployed in missile silos around Malmstrom AFB, Montana; Minot AFB, North Dakota; and Francis E. Warren AFB, Wyoming.[10]\n\nWould you want to use a computer that was made in the 1970s?\n\nIf not, then why would we want to fight a nuclear war with missiles made in the 1970s?\n\nIf a nuclear war with Russia erupts, we will be sending 400 hopelessly outdated land-based missiles against the extremely sophisticated anti-missile systems that the Russians have now developed.\n\nAre you sure that our missiles will get through?\n\nNeedless to say, our land-based missiles are only one-third of our \u201cnuclear triad\u201d.\n\nOur strategic bombers are another leg of the triad.  The B-52 bomber has been around for a long time, and it is capable of carrying nuclear weapons\u2026\n\nThe B-52 is a long-range, heavy bomber that can perform a variety of missions. It can carry nuclear or precision guided conventional weapons with worldwide precision navigation. The B-52 is slated to be in service beyond 2040.\n\nUnfortunately, I wouldn\u2019t count on B-52 bombers doing much, because they would get absolutely shredded by Russian anti-aircraft systems.\n\nOur stealth bombers are much better choices\u2026\n\nThe B-2 Spirit is a multirole stealth bomber capable of delivering both conventional and nuclear weapons. The B-21 Raider will first supplement, then eventually replace, the B-2 beginning in the mid-2020s.\n\nOf course if the Russians destroy our airbases in a devastating first strike from their subs before we can even get our bombers loaded and off the ground, this leg of the triad won\u2019t be of much use either.\n\nThe final leg of our nuclear triad is made up of just 14 Ohio-class submarines\u2026\n\nFourteen Ohio-class SSBNs make up the most survivable leg of the nuclear triad. Their stealth design makes finding an SSBN an almost impossible task, giving pause to potential adversaries. The Columbia-class SSBN program will begin to replace the Ohio-class SSBNs starting in the early 2030s.\n\nAs the Department of Defense has noted, these submarines are definitely \u201cthe most survivable leg of the nuclear triad\u201d.\n\nIf the Russians nuke us, we should be able to send sub-based missiles back at them.\n\nBut once again, those missiles are outdated.\n\nRight now, our Ohio-class subs are carrying Trident II missiles that first went into service in 1990\u2026\n\nThe UGM-133A Trident II, or Trident D5 is a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM), built by Lockheed Martin Space in Sunnyvale, California, and deployed with the American and British navies. It was first deployed in March 1990,[6] and remains in service. The Trident II Strategic Weapons System is an improved SLBM with greater accuracy, payload, and range than the earlier Trident C-4. It is a key element of the U.S. strategic nuclear triad and strengthens U.S. strategic deterrence.\n\nI believe that Trident II missiles are a more viable threat than Minuteman III missiles are, but they are still more than 30 years old.\n\nAre you sure that our aging Trident II missiles will be able to get through the cutting edge anti-missile systems that the Russians have now developed?\n\nBy the way, the Chinese have been working very hard to develop sophisticated anti-missile systems as well.\n\nMeanwhile, we continue to pretend that the doctrine of \u201cmutual assured destruction\u201d will magically save us even though the balance of power has fundamentally shifted.\n\nAs I have repeatedly warned my readers, we could soon find ourselves involved in wars with Russia and China at the same time.\n\nBefore we do that, perhaps we should take a really hard look at our own capabilities.\n\nMany of the old paradigms no longer apply, and we are far more vulnerable than most people realize.",

The following information about the S-500 comes from Wikipedia\u2026</p>\n\n<p>The S-500 is designed for intercepting and destroying intercontinental ballistic missiles, as well as hypersonic cruise missiles and aircraft, for air defense against Airborne Early Warning and Control and for jamming aircraft.[citation needed] With a planned range of 600 km (370 mi) for anti-ballistic missile (ABM) and 500 km (310 mi) for air defense,[22] the S-500 would be able to detect and simultaneously engage up to 10 ballistic hypersonic targets flying at a speed of 5 kilometres per second (3.1 mi/s)[23][24] to a limit of 7 km/s (4.3 mi/s).[25][26] It also aims at destroying hypersonic cruise missiles and other aerial targets at speeds of higher than Mach 5, as well as spacecraft. The altitude of a target engaged can be as high as 180\u2013200 km (110\u2013120 mi).[27] It is effective against ballistic missiles with a launch range of 3,500 km (2,200 mi), the radar reaches a radius of 3,000 km (1,300 km for the EPR 0,1 square meter).[28][29] Other targets it has been announced to defend against include unmanned aerial vehicles, low Earth orbit satellites, space weapons launched from hypersonic aircraft, and hypersonic orbital platforms.[30]</p>\n\n<p>The system is mobile and has rapid deployability. Experts believe that the system\u2019s capabilities can affect enemy intercontinental ballistic missiles at the middle and end portions of flight,[22] but reports by Almaz-Antey say that the external target-designation system (RLS Voronezh-DM and missile defence system A-135 radar Don-2N) will be capable of mid-early flight portion interceptions of enemy ballistic missiles, which is one of the final stages of the S-500 project. It is to have a response time of less than 4 seconds (Compared to the S-400\u2019s less than 10).[31]</p>\n\n<p>Sadly, the U.S. has not developed new land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles in decades.  At this point, the backbone of our land-based arsenal consists of just 400 extremely outdated Minuteman III missiles.  The following comes from the official website of the U.S. Department of Defense\u2026</p>\n\n<p>Up to 400 Minuteman III missiles make up the most responsive leg of the nuclear triad. America\u2019s ICBM force has remained on continuous, around-the-clock alert since 1959. The Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent program will begin the replacement of Minuteman III and modernization of the 450 ICBM launch facilities in 2029.</p>\n\n<p>In 1970, the Minuteman III became the first deployed ICBM with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRV): three smaller warheads that improved the missile\u2019s ability to strike targets defended by ABMs.[8] They were initially armed with the W62 warhead with a yield of 170 kilotons.</p>\n\n<p>By the 1970s, 1,000 Minuteman missiles were deployed. This force has shrunk to 400 Minuteman III missiles as of September 2017,[9] deployed in missile silos around Malmstrom AFB, Montana; Minot AFB, North Dakota; and Francis E. Warren AFB, Wyoming.[10]</p>\n\n<p>Would you want to use a computer that was made in the 1970s?</p>\n\n<p>If not, then why would we want to fight a nuclear war with missiles made in the 1970s?</p>\n\n<p>If a nuclear war with Russia erupts, we will be sending 400 hopelessly outdated land-based missiles against the extremely sophisticated anti-missile systems that the Russians have now developed.</p>\n\n<p>Are you sure that our missiles will get through?</p>\n\n<p>Needless to say, our land-based missiles are only one-third of our \u201cnuclear triad\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>Our strategic bombers are another leg of the triad.  The B-52 bomber has been around for a long time, and it is capable of carrying nuclear weapons\u2026</p>\n\n<p>The B-52 is a long-range, heavy bomber that can perform a variety of missions. It can carry nuclear or precision guided conventional weapons with worldwide precision navigation. The B-52 is slated to be in service beyond 2040.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, I wouldn\u2019t count on B-52 bombers doing much, because they would get absolutely shredded by Russian anti-aircraft systems.</p>\n\n<p>Our stealth bombers are much better choices\u2026</p>\n\n<p>The B-2 Spirit is a multirole stealth bomber capable of delivering both conventional and nuclear weapons. The B-21 Raider will first supplement, then eventually replace, the B-2 beginning in the mid-2020s.</p>\n\n<p>Of course if the Russians destroy our airbases in a devastating first strike from their subs before we can even get our bombers loaded and off the ground, this leg of the triad won\u2019t be of much use either.</p>\n\n<p>The final leg of our nuclear triad is made up of just 14 Ohio-class submarines\u2026</p>\n\n<p>Fourteen Ohio-class SSBNs make up the most survivable leg of the nuclear triad. Their stealth design makes finding an SSBN an almost impossible task, giving pause to potential adversaries. The Columbia-class SSBN program will begin to replace the Ohio-class SSBNs starting in the early 2030s.</p>\n\n<p>As the Department of Defense has noted, these submarines are definitely \u201cthe most survivable leg of the nuclear triad\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>If the Russians nuke us, we should be able to send sub-based missiles back at them.</p>\n\n<p>But once again, those missiles are outdated.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, our Ohio-class subs are carrying Trident II missiles that first went into service in 1990\u2026</p>\n\n<p>The UGM-133A Trident II, or Trident D5 is a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM), built by Lockheed Martin Space in Sunnyvale, California, and deployed with the American and British navies. It was first deployed in March 1990,[6] and remains in service. The Trident II Strategic Weapons System is an improved SLBM with greater accuracy, payload, and range than the earlier Trident C-4. It is a key element of the U.S. strategic nuclear triad and strengthens U.S. strategic deterrence.</p>\n\n<p>I believe that Trident II missiles are a more viable threat than Minuteman III missiles are, but they are still more than 30 years old.</p>\n\n<p>Are you sure that our aging Trident II missiles will be able to get through the cutting edge anti-missile systems that the Russians have now developed?</p>\n\n<p>By the way, the Chinese have been working very hard to develop sophisticated anti-missile systems as well.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, we continue to pretend that the doctrine of \u201cmutual assured destruction\u201d will magically save us even though the balance of power has fundamentally shifted.</p>\n\n<p>As I have repeatedly warned my readers, we could soon find ourselves involved in wars with Russia and China at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>Before we do that, perhaps we should take a really hard look at our own capabilities.</p>\n\n<p>Many of the old paradigms no longer apply, and we are far more vulnerable than most people realize.</p>\n</div>",
