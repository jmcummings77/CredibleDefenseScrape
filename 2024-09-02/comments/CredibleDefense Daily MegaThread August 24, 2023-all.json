        "body": "An update on the new Russian formations after my [previous one](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/15h27gj/comment/jup64ba/), now that more news have been published.\n\nLast year, with the \"partial mobilization\", Russia replenished the ranks of the regular formations with the mobilized and formed the \"Territorial Forces\". The mobilized are a too very diverse and large sample to be simplified. Even the VDV and the Naval Infantry have replenished their losses with the mobilized. But generally with the better ones, perhaps already members of these corps in the past. In addition, I read on a Russian Telegram channel that most of the personnel of the 70th and 71st Motorized Regiments of the 42nd Motorized Division (58th Army) would be made up of mobilized, yet they are having a decent performance in the battlefield.\n\nThe mobilized soldiers closest to the \"Mobik\" stereotype (older, less fit and little motivated) are generally the ones included in the motorized regiments of the Territorial Forces, a new entity formed by Russia last year. For instance, the vast majority of the protest video appeals published and translated by Dmtri from WarTranslated come from personnel of these regiments (or from mobilized men sent to the 1st or 2nd Corps). \n\nThese regiments are organized on a regional basis and are often attached to a regular formation. For example, the 1441st Regiment (mobilized men from Altaj Krai) would be attached to the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade; the 1307th Regiment (mobilized men probably from Moscow Oblast) would be among the ones under the command of the 150th Motorized Division, etc. Otherwise, they are included in new motorized divisions formed exclusively by territorial units. The Territorial Forces have several tank and artillery regiments too. I recommend [this Substack](https://thelookoutn.substack.com/) which keeps a very good track of the new Russian units, that are much more hidden than the Ukrainian ones at least to a non-native speaking audience like most of us.\n\nNow Russia is beginning to create far more complex formations: Combined Arms Armies.\n\nThe 25th Combined Arms Army is being established in Irkutsk Oblast and Primorsky Krai (i.e. Vladivostok region) - denying initial reports, it will not be part of the Central Military District. It will have 30 thousand troops. Latest reports write it will made up of two separate motorized divisions + detached brigades. The existing formations of the Eastern Military District will have to transfer about 10 thousand officers and contract personnel who will form the experienced cadre of the 25th Army. A side note: given the losses that a large part of the EMD formations are experiencing (all of them are deployed in the frontlines between Polohy and Vuhledar, except for the 57th Brigade of the 5th Army which is near Bakhmut) and will suffer in the next months, it will be very interesting to understand the feasibility of such a move without major damages to the operational capabilities of the existing formations.\n\nThe rest of the personnel will be made up, in their intentions, of volunteers. Lots of announcements of open positions have been published, the salaries + bonuses seem very competitive (a Russian source quoted in the latest Substack report called them \"record\": 600 thousand rubles as a one-time bonus and 200 thousand rubles monthly salary); also one can join this formation from any part of Russia and not only from the Far East. In case the volunteers will not be enough (that is, probably), I assume it will be manned by new mobilized men. \n\nIt's already known that the 25th Army will be sent to the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia Oblasts (it's written in the announcements) and will begin to be deployed to the front since December. It will likely relieve the most damaged formations deployed to the front.\n\nThe strange thing, however, is that despite being formed, trained and associated with the Eastern Military District (training is supposed to be in Dalnegorsk), from what I have read the 25th Army will actually be part of the Southern Military District. \n\nThis could be due to organizational reasons - the whole front from the mouth of the Dnipro up to the border with the Polohy sector is in the hands of the SMD, but probably also strategic ones: I had read that at the moment the responsibility for the southern front could mainly be in the hands of the EMD, but this could change and the SMD could see an ever increasing importance. \n\nIt could also be due to \"power clashes\" among the various MDs. The Southern Military District is undoubtedly the largest, the most autonomous and also the most capable. With the new additions it could end up larger than all the rest of the Military Districts combined and almost an Army in its own right. This would also reflect the growing importance of Rostov on the Russian supply chain. Let's recall that there have been instances where coordination between MDs hasn't been good at all and in fact the Russian Army tries to mix units from different MDs as little as possible. The management pyramid of the Russian Army is much more complicated than the Ukrainian one and there are much more power hubs, between MDs, CAAs, Divisions, etc.\n\nWith the exception of the 3rd Corps created last year and aggregated to the Western Military District (although I wonder if this is only on paper - actually it operates in the territories of responsibility of the 8th Army of the Southern MD), only the SMD in fact saw the establishment of new formations (plus the integration of the 1st and 2nd Corps - the former armies of the D/LPR). This might suggest that the Eastern MD may be intended to be a sort of operational appendage of the SMD and confirm that the Western and Central MDs will be intended to operate only north of the Siversky Donets River without trespassing elsewhere, like it has been the case for over a year.\n\nThe creation of the 18th Combined Arms Army of the Southern Military District was also made official as well, confirming the rumors of the Ukrainian military observer Mashovets of a couple of weeks ago. It will consist of two Corps: the 22nd Corps (already existing) and the 40th Corps (to be created - the news of the latter's establishment had been known for months). The commander of the Army will be Lieutenant General Arkady Marzoev, former commander of the 22nd Corps. This Corps is based in Crimea and is made up of the 126th Coastal Defense Brigade and the 127th Reconnaissance Brigade. Both are active and deployed near Kherson on the opposite bank of the Dnipro.\n\nThe 40th Corps (based in Stavropol) is expected to include the new 47th Motorized Division (manned apparently in large part by mobilized men from Crimea) and the new 144th Motorized Brigade. In total, the 18th Army will have 25 thousand men. This Army is supposed to be sent to the Kherson Oblast (part of it, moreover, is already deployed there) to enable the units currently there to be moved to the southern front (the one affected by the counteroffensive), which is always in need of reinforcements. The deployment of the 18th Army could be a prelude to the departure of the elements of the 49th Army still in Kherson Oblast and of the 14th Corps of the Arctic Fleet.\n\nMashovets said in early August that the 70th Motorized Division of the 18th Army would have already been sent to Kherson Oblast to replace the 7th VDV Division which is now fully deployed between the Orikhiv and Velyka Novosilka sectors. I could not find any news about this division. It could be an additional formation to be added to the two Corps that hasn't been made official yet or it could be the 47th Division that has changed its name so as not to be confused with the 47th Tank Division of the 1st GTA of the WMD. According to Mashovets this 70th Division should consist of the 26th and 28th Motorized Regiments, the 24th Rifle Regiment, the 17th Tank Regiment and the 81st Artillery Regiment.\n\nIn addition, one new regiment will be added to both the 98th and 106th VDV Divisions (respectively, the 299th and 119th Regiments). Right now these divisions consist of just two airborne regiments. They will probably be reformed along the lines of the 76th and 7th VDV Divisions, that is, they will change from \"airborne\" to \"air assault\" classification. The main distinction is that the latter are more heavily equipped, e.g. often with BMPs instead of BMDs, and have a tank unit. The 106th Division (deployed entirely around Soledar) for example may have already received a tank company/battalion - Telegram channels associated with the division have been posting videos of T-90Ms in action in the sector for weeks. Nonetheless, the two new regiments of the 98th and 106th Divisions according to Russian sources will not be mechanized, i.e., they will not have heavy equipment, but instead will be a kind of rifle regiments, I assume specialized for combat in forested or urban settings.\n\nThe VDV will also create the new 104th Division by expanding the 31st Brigade (so they are going to add two more new regiments, since a brigade is very similar to a regiment in the Russian order of battle, particularly in the VDV). There is talk of the potential future creation of up to five new VDV brigades. The 52nd VDV Artillery Brigade is also going be created (until now the VDV had only the organic artillery units of its divisions/brigades). I believe it will be part of the 7th VDV Division.",

The management pyramid of the Russian Army is much more complicated than the Ukrainian one and there are much more power hubs, between MDs, CAAs, Divisions, etc.</p>\n\n<p>With the exception of the 3rd Corps created last year and aggregated to the Western Military District (although I wonder if this is only on paper - actually it operates in the territories of responsibility of the 8th Army of the Southern MD), only the SMD in fact saw the establishment of new formations (plus the integration of the 1st and 2nd Corps - the former armies of the D/LPR). This might suggest that the Eastern MD may be intended to be a sort of operational appendage of the SMD and confirm that the Western and Central MDs will be intended to operate only north of the Siversky Donets River without trespassing elsewhere, like it has been the case for over a year.</p>\n\n<p>The creation of the 18th Combined Arms Army of the Southern Military District was also made official as well, confirming the rumors of the Ukrainian military observer Mashovets of a couple of weeks ago. It will consist of two Corps: the 22nd Corps (already existing) and the 40th Corps (to be created - the news of the latter&#39;s establishment had been known for months). The commander of the Army will be Lieutenant General Arkady Marzoev, former commander of the 22nd Corps. This Corps is based in Crimea and is made up of the 126th Coastal Defense Brigade and the 127th Reconnaissance Brigade. Both are active and deployed near Kherson on the opposite bank of the Dnipro.</p>\n\n<p>The 40th Corps (based in Stavropol) is expected to include the new 47th Motorized Division (manned apparently in large part by mobilized men from Crimea) and the new 144th Motorized Brigade. In total, the 18th Army will have 25 thousand men. This Army is supposed to be sent to the Kherson Oblast (part of it, moreover, is already deployed there) to enable the units currently there to be moved to the southern front (the one affected by the counteroffensive), which is always in need of reinforcements. The deployment of the 18th Army could be a prelude to the departure of the elements of the 49th Army still in Kherson Oblast and of the 14th Corps of the Arctic Fleet.</p>\n\n<p>Mashovets said in early August that the 70th Motorized Division of the 18th Army would have already been sent to Kherson Oblast to replace the 7th VDV Division which is now fully deployed between the Orikhiv and Velyka Novosilka sectors. I could not find any news about this division. It could be an additional formation to be added to the two Corps that hasn&#39;t been made official yet or it could be the 47th Division that has changed its name so as not to be confused with the 47th Tank Division of the 1st GTA of the WMD. According to Mashovets this 70th Division should consist of the 26th and 28th Motorized Regiments, the 24th Rifle Regiment, the 17th Tank Regiment and the 81st Artillery Regiment.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, one new regiment will be added to both the 98th and 106th VDV Divisions (respectively, the 299th and 119th Regiments). Right now these divisions consist of just two airborne regiments. They will probably be reformed along the lines of the 76th and 7th VDV Divisions, that is, they will change from &quot;airborne&quot; to &quot;air assault&quot; classification. The main distinction is that the latter are more heavily equipped, e.g. often with BMPs instead of BMDs, and have a tank unit. The 106th Division (deployed entirely around Soledar) for example may have already received a tank company/battalion - Telegram channels associated with the division have been posting videos of T-90Ms in action in the sector for weeks. Nonetheless, the two new regiments of the 98th and 106th Divisions according to Russian sources will not be mechanized, i.e., they will not have heavy equipment, but instead will be a kind of rifle regiments, I assume specialized for combat in forested or urban settings.</p>\n\n<p>The VDV will also create the new 104th Division by expanding the 31st Brigade (so they are going to add two more new regiments, since a brigade is very similar to a regiment in the Russian order of battle, particularly in the VDV). There is talk of the potential future creation of up to five new VDV brigades. The 52nd VDV Artillery Brigade is also going be created (until now the VDV had only the organic artillery units of its divisions/brigades). I believe it will be part of the 7th VDV Division.</p>\n</div>",

Expecting the USAF to have the resources to train Ukrainian pilots is of course ridiculous if you know that US institutions are generally not competent when it comes to dealing with foreign languages and people. The US military has ridiculous restrictions on information sharing with foreign partners.

Perhaps because it is not as sexy as boondoggles like the drug war.

For the line units doing the mission, it's just one of many missions they are responsible for. The personnel doing the mission get training at most a few months before doing it for the first time. They learn the mission from scratch, do it two or three times, then rotate out to another job, meaning the units are constantly inexperienced. The deployed units are responsible for sourcing translators, which they might not even know how helpful they are until after doing one of these deployments. This is because the people doing the training and the personnel at HQ in charge of the line units generally have little to no experience with the work the unit does and they also rotate out every two to four years. It is very difficult to build up institutional knowledge this way.\n\nFurthermore so long as the vessels are boarded and inspected and the CO and HQ is happy with the numbers, nobody really cares about the quality of the boardings or the enforcement actions that result.

The translator I sourced basically came as a favor to me and they just happened to have all the right skills. But the service branch is not actively seeking people with the skills. So meeting the need still comes down to informal agreements and luck. Nor is the branch building up long-term civilian expertise who could accompany the military units and provide it. It's a law enforcement mission, and our international partners used civilian personnel to fulfill it. These personnel had years of experience doing so.

Note that does not include any tactical proficiency beyond knowing some basics on how to operate some systems.</p>\n\n<p>So that article was talking about Ukrainians doing it in 2-4x the length of a US pilot to do the basic stuff (like handle emergency procedures, safely takeoff and land, etc.), and if you realize it takes a US pilot ~2 years to get proficient tactically in the F-16, the 4-5 year line by General Hecker lines up.</p>\n\n<p>And Sen. Mark Kelly <a href=\"https://www.democraticunderground.com/100217741228\">said this about the Russian collision with our MQ-9</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>He said the incident last week where a Russian fighter jet dumped fuel on and then clipped the propeller of a US military drone shows how &quot;reckless&quot; and &quot;incompetent&quot; they are.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m not surprised by this. I mean, I flew with Russian pilots, fighter pilots who couldn&#39;t fly formation. And I watched this video, and it&#39;s pretty obvious what happened. He lost sight of it, and he crashed into it,&quot; Kelly told CNN&#39;s Jake Tapper on &quot;State of the Union&quot; Sunday.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Soooooo yeah. The quality of training an air force made up of ex-Soviet/Russian equipment with ex-Soviet/Russian training is going to take some time to correct</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "I'm curious what people think about the impact of Ukraine's maritime drones on the naval warfare paradigm. My opinion is effectively that they are \"priced in\" to current naval thinking already, and that their impact is more limited than is commonly (on Reddit, but also lots of opinion pieces in conventional media) asserted. I'm challenged on that quite a lot - the complete obsolescence of major warships has been asserted to me multiple times. I don't buy that for a moment but I did want to talk about the topic in a more focused sub to see what other people thought.\n\nAs I see it the main advantage of the drones is their range (which Russia at least clearly didn't expect - see the [Novorossyisk strike](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-66402046)) and their cheapness ($250,000 per is the most common figure I've seen quoted). As weapons though they leave much to be desired - slow, apparently easy to disable (we've seen them destroyed by helicopters using a door gunner), no ability to find targets beyond optical means. Given their size they would presumably suffer quite severely in poor sea states too - at the very least that would impede their ability to actually find a target. The human guidance too is something that I consider a major limitation - advocates of the strength of a drone swarm point to the fact that something like an LRASM is [$3.5 million](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/32277/here-is-what-each-of-the-pentagons-air-launched-missiles-and-bombs-actually-cost) which gives you 14 drones per each LRASM if the cost of the drone is the only cost, and that kind of thing seems like it would scale well - a modern warship is probably a lot less capable of dealing with 28 - 56 USVs than 2-4 AShMs. But that's not the only cost, because you've got to pay the salaries of probably 2 or 3 shift's worth of drone operators (each shift being 28-56 people if that's how many you want to attack with at once) plus people to maintain the equipment and so on, and then feed them, house them, clothe them etc. Then you need infrastructure to handle their control of the drones and so on. Tl;dr it seems to me that there's a lot of non-drone costs that cripple the idea of \"we can just make 1,000 drone attack waves to kill your battlegroup\". The Ukrainian's use of them so far has had success, but to my knowledge only against poorly defended (and largely unaware) targets in constrained choke points - they've badly damaged tankers and amphibs in or close to harbour, but I don't think they've managed to seriously damage any warships or ships running at sea. Of course some of these problems could be remedied, with complex automated guidance or improved speed and so on...but then you're turning it from a $250,000 weapon into something more like a $3.5million weapon and we already have those.\n\nAs for being priced in; you can see in the designs and loadouts of some warships in build seem that catering for the threat is at the forefront of people's mind's these days. The USN has Hellfire and the 57mm on their LCS, and is carrying both over to the Constellation. The RN has a 57mm and 2x 40mm on their Type 31s, and they're packing Martlet onto their Wildcats and experimenting with it on shipborne mounts too. Those things seem fairly obviously designed with fighting drone swarms in a more cost-effective manner than would be the case ordinarily in mind, so I don't see that the proof of the efficacy of the drone attacks during this war is likely to lead to much in the way of design changes - at least not **warship** design changes. \n\nWhat're people's thoughts? Is the impact overblown, or is this genuinely a new threat that is going to shift naval thinking?",

Not only were US troops withdrawn, but the necessary military support required for the ANA to conduct operations was also curtailed.\r\n   * To what extend, if at all, do you think that U.S. support towards Ukraine has had in restoring that credibility?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* As ignominious as the withdrawal was, and as much of a moral failure that it was, can it be understood as a strategic win for the US? A few points I had in mind:\r\n   * Freed up political capital in regards to Ukraine:\r\n      * Might be argued that, had the US still maintained its unpopular commitment to Afghanistan, Biden would have had less political capital to spend on support for Ukraine. Especially had the insurgency in Afghanistan picked up again, and resulted in U.S casualties and required further commitments, I think it\u2019s unlikely that Biden would have been able to push through and justify the extent of support given to Ukraine whilst also having to spend capital on maintaining and perhaps expanding US presence in Afghanistan.\r\n   * Freed up US military and intelligence assets:\r\n      * At the time of the Doha agreement, the U.S. force level in Afghanistan was 13,000 - a not inconsiderable force. As the US enters a period of great power competition, it may be advantageous to have the greatest number of assets available to be deployed and react to crises.\r\n   * Obviously the US still has a vested interest in maintaining the stability of Afghanistan and preventing the expansion of Islamist elements - but the brunt of this responsibility now would seem to fall on Iran and Pakistan, who will have to reap what they have sown vis a vis their support of the Taliban. This arguably has already played out with regards to the clashes between Iran and Taliban fighters, and may contribute towards Pakistan\u2019s own taliban problem. Given that Iran can be defined as a strategic competitor of the US, and Pakistan is sliding further into China\u2019s orbit, might this be understood as a win for the US?\r\n   * Given the US more room for manoeuvre in terms of its relations with Pakistan. Now they are no longer operating in Afghanistan, the bedrock of the US-Pakistan relationship has greatly diminished. The US is no longer as constrained in how they act towards Pakistan and can thus seek closer ties with India without worrying about the implications it may have on relations with Pakistan and its operations in Afghanistan.\r\n   * Finally, had the US remained in Afghanistan, could it have been used as a means by Russia to deter greater US support for Ukraine by threatening to supply arms and materiel to the Taliban insurgency?\r\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* And finally, perhaps a clear failure of the withdrawal was that it may have contributed towards Putin\u2019s rationale in the decision to invade Ukraine.

This was a recent post \n\n________________________________________________________\n\nThere is a huge problem at the front - the mobility of our military and light transport, which needs to be solved and solved sensibly, and not drive those who voice it into meat assaults or a pit.\n\nCars such as loaves are very, very in demand in those conditions, but in most cases they are civilian, donated by volunteers, or bought and issued to someone from the warring family. It is not always possible to register it, it must be transferred to the gratuitous use of the Ministry of Defense, and even then not everything can be registered. But by order of the commanders, such vehicles are confiscated or shot. And they help a lot, but based on this situation, the fighters have to travel at their own peril and risk, performing the tasks of their direct commanders.\n\nAnd here two more structures come into play - the military police or the military traffic police. For the fact that the car is not registered, there are no black numbers, or your turn signal is faulty - the car is taken away, and you yourself go to an amazing place - a pit, which, as the front-line soldiers say, \"has already grown to army proportions.\" Both malicious violators of discipline and those who simply fell under the hot hand of the commander get there: unshaven, left the bath in slippers, the absence of one of the red bandages at once for 7 days.\n\nDrivers who drive military vehicles and pull their performance on themselves (maintenance of vehicles, both civilian and military, is mainly based on the guys\u2019 personal funds) also for the slightest violation, for example, the absence of his last name on the list at checkpoints, even in the presence of a BR-ki, it falls into a pit, sometimes it comes to insanity and you can get into a pit simply if you become objectionable to your commander.\n\nThe guys say that \u201cthe feeling is that we are at war with the enemy, and the commanders are at war with us\u201d, loading them with bureaucratic work, scribbling heaps of papers.\n\nBut the most painful issue is transport, there is not enough military equipment, and civilian use is prohibited. The situation is not like this everywhere, the 2nd army is getting out of the situation, Akhmat is also trying somehow, but there are problems in the 20th army - they cannot freely use all possible equipment and fight normally. It comes to the point that they are already once again thinking about whether to take the 300th to the hospital, since there is no BR for the car, or go to the very front along the broken roads, when to restore the transport at their own expense in case of something, and if the VAI breaks down caught - you can fall into the pit.\n\nModern warfare requires a modern approach. New realities, but most of the high command simply does not want to rebuild and cling to medieval rules, which worsens the situation at the front. You don\u2019t pull a sock, you don\u2019t shave, and so on - the Bakhmut direction, and the boys are happy to go there, they say, it\u2019s calmer there in terms of command.\n\nAnd again - this topic does not come from the very top. This is again the middle link trying to bureaucratize the warring army. And, of course, it is doubly insulting when the guys who need to urgently take or bring something from the front line need cars for mobility, for the work of the DRG, for the removal of the wounded, where not all equipment can pass, they put Vaishniks in the pit, who have never been on the first line.",

In this circumstance, Ukraine actually has two \u201cdecent\u201d options.  Option one, the simplest, is to continue hammering away at this offensive with the hope that Russia implodes again.  Not ideal, but if it pans out you\u2019ve suddenly solved all of your problems, and if it doesn\u2019t, well, you were in a bad spot to begin with, you might as well take your final option to get total victory.  Option two is to cancel the offensive (except maybe some basic light infantry and artillery pressure to keep the Russians sweating, and using the remainder of the western donated equipment (which took some attrition but there\u2019s still plenty left) as a defensive reserve to then be able to foil future Russian offensives, that way guaranteeing a stalemate, maybe even better if Russia economically collapses (editor\u2019s note, it probably won\u2019t).  \n\nEventuality 2: Ukraine **can** rely on sustained western heavy aid in the future even if the offensive fails.  I think in this case the only correct option is to call off the offensive immediately (unless victory is certain due to secret intel that I don\u2019t have access to, keep in mind this entire thing is written based only on open sources).  Why take heavy attrition now when there are glaring issues with your force structure that are coming to light?  If the west is willing to do their part to make sure the Ukrainians only grow stronger, then Ukraine should do their part and try and work on the training/command/synchronization issues before attempting any more mechanized assaults.  If the long game is secure, play it.\n\nEventuality 3: Ukraine has no way of determining future western heavy aid.  Uh, in Ukraine\u2019s place I\u2019d panic then.  How are you supposed to make military decisions if you don\u2019t know how strong your own damn army will be in 1 year?\n\nAnyway, these are just my opinions (\"what I'd do if I were you\") but I've been meaning to write them down.",

But attacking here should favor Ukraine more than other points on the lines. \n    3. Robotyne has lots of lines of defense which make it very hard to attack down to Tomak.

In theory Ukraine has reserves held back so that when an opening is possible, it can be seized.

I am sure there are flaws with this plan, but the thinking seems sound.

I\u2019d love it if they could maneuver through minefields, but I see no way for them to do so without repeating Vuhledar for the Russians. The mistake Russians made at Vuhledar was to keep trying the same heavy equipment run through the same stretches of mined roads repeatedly. Ukraine quickly adapted to harsh reality, and hasn\u2019t succumbed to the Concord fallacy when columns have assaulted other parts of the front (e.g. a few weeks ago in Robotyne). Vuhledar was a mistake because Russians threw good money after bad. Ukraine has shown more flexibility than that. \n\nIt strikes me that what the US wants is linear progress.

They made it clear that wasn't the case when within weeks they were needing to admit at the strategic political level that things were going very slow. They thought they were going to get fast breakthroughs, reserves don't factor in until after that. Reserves would factor in on later advances, especially the Russian strategic reserves, but that's a totally different story.

Because for nine years the Army has done little else but prep to fight the exact war the Ukrainians are fighting.\n\nMeanwhile, Zaluzhny joined the UAF around the Dissolution of the Soviet Union, when funding was a joke, readiness was more the joke, corruption wasn't just rampant his entire career, it was The Way. Not a single point in his entire career was the UAF not a joke until he was already a general after the Donbas War started, and at best it was a proficient defensive army. Plus, the Donbas War was largely a COIN fight in 2014-5 too. When it went to conventional ops against the Russians in 14-5, the UAF often came a distant second.\n\nThen afterwards when he was commanding operational sectors in Ukraine, they still weren't prepping for large scale combat ops against Russia, prepping for Kursk, they were prepping for battalion and brigade sized deployments to the JFO to hold static defensive fortifications in what amounted to a platoon to battalion commanders fight. This guy was probably never involved in any role involving any training on a mechanized attack above company level his entire career UNTIL BECOMING COMMANDER IN CHIEF, and then learning by commanding in a war. Let that sink in. And that isn't just him, that's all of them. \n\nThey didn't even have a tactical command level that existed above brigade and below the four regional operational commands of Ukraine. No division, no corps, and it's been that way for decades. Yeah, really focused on fighting Russia. Didn't even have a plan in place to be invaded by Russia. Didn't have a clue what to do when they mobilized their country, despite that being written into law. And they have the audacity to call out the people who wrote most of the book on modern warfare? \n\nGo look at Kursk? Yeah, let's look at it. That was a really terrible offensive with zero surprise, the Red Army was totally prepared for as they were forewarned ahead of time, where the Germans were pessimistic going in, where Hitler supposedly would get sick to his stomach thinking about launching it, doing so only out of feelings of political optics that were really stupid to begin with, which was called off as soon as they got pessimistic about the threat to another front being attacked. Wow, there are actually a lot of good lessons to apply to this offensive too.\n\nHey Zaluzhny, why not mention Bagration? The time your ancestors didn't deliberately attack the place they telegraphed ahead of time. Where they actually used this miraculous thing called a \"deception plan.\"\n\nTwo f'ing summers in a row Ukraine told the whole world where they were going to launch their big strategic offensive well ahead of time, and then attacked that location. \n\nThe only difference between this time and last was when they wanted to do a dual Kherson Zaporizhzhia attack in 2022, the US [talked them out of Zaporizhzhia](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/12/29/ukraine-offensive-kharkiv-kherson-donetsk/) because it wouldn't have worked then either, so Zaluzhny picked Kharkiv as their supporting attack instead after local commanders recommended it and did all the work planning it (not Zaluzhny). But that was why the Kherson offensive wasn't doing well, despite hitting the bridges and majorly screwing with Russian resupply, it was still too well defended. Maybe the Russians wouldn't have reinforced the shit out of it had Ukrainian strategic leadership not said they were gonna go attack it. \n\nBut this time Zaluzhny did his own thing, ignored warnings and advice, and after the better part of 9 months telling the world and the Russians they were going to attack the South towards Melitopol and Berdyansk, they did just that. But wait, still committed half units to hold the east in force, especially his artillery. Even now, 7 out of 9 separate artillery brigades **AREN'T** supporting the strategy main effort. \n\nYeah, the US Army doesn't know how to fight this type of war, only Ukraine does. Right...",

And that isn&#39;t just him, that&#39;s all of them. </p>\n\n<p>They didn&#39;t even have a tactical command level that existed above brigade and below the four regional operational commands of Ukraine. No division, no corps, and it&#39;s been that way for decades. Yeah, really focused on fighting Russia. Didn&#39;t even have a plan in place to be invaded by Russia. Didn&#39;t have a clue what to do when they mobilized their country, despite that being written into law. And they have the audacity to call out the people who wrote most of the book on modern warfare? </p>\n\n<p>Go look at Kursk? Yeah, let&#39;s look at it. That was a really terrible offensive with zero surprise, the Red Army was totally prepared for as they were forewarned ahead of time, where the Germans were pessimistic going in, where Hitler supposedly would get sick to his stomach thinking about launching it, doing so only out of feelings of political optics that were really stupid to begin with, which was called off as soon as they got pessimistic about the threat to another front being attacked. Wow, there are actually a lot of good lessons to apply to this offensive too.</p>\n\n<p>Hey Zaluzhny, why not mention Bagration? The time your ancestors didn&#39;t deliberately attack the place they telegraphed ahead of time. Where they actually used this miraculous thing called a &quot;deception plan.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Two f&#39;ing summers in a row Ukraine told the whole world where they were going to launch their big strategic offensive well ahead of time, and then attacked that location. </p>\n\n<p>The only difference between this time and last was when they wanted to do a dual Kherson Zaporizhzhia attack in 2022, the US <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/12/29/ukraine-offensive-kharkiv-kherson-donetsk/\">talked them out of Zaporizhzhia</a> because it wouldn&#39;t have worked then either, so Zaluzhny picked Kharkiv as their supporting attack instead after local commanders recommended it and did all the work planning it (not Zaluzhny). But that was why the Kherson offensive wasn&#39;t doing well, despite hitting the bridges and majorly screwing with Russian resupply, it was still too well defended. Maybe the Russians wouldn&#39;t have reinforced the shit out of it had Ukrainian strategic leadership not said they were gonna go attack it. </p>\n\n<p>But this time Zaluzhny did his own thing, ignored warnings and advice, and after the better part of 9 months telling the world and the Russians they were going to attack the South towards Melitopol and Berdyansk, they did just that. But wait, still committed half units to hold the east in force, especially his artillery. Even now, 7 out of 9 separate artillery brigades <strong>AREN&#39;T</strong> supporting the strategy main effort. </p>\n\n<p>Yeah, the US Army doesn&#39;t know how to fight this type of war, only Ukraine does. Right...</p>\n</div>",

Especially don't tell everyone where you are doing it. That's a pretty important one. Most definitely, don't assure the world on TV that the offensive is definitely going to happen a few days before launching it, like [Zelensky did](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukraines-zelensky-we-are-ready-for-counteroffensive-22f4f3f2). \n\nDrones are tactical level, they won't trigger losing strategic surprise. Russian Orlans might get into the brigade rear of the UAF tactical area but that's it. And Russian military satellites suck, they're notorious for sucking. And they don't have many. Camo netting or parking in treelines will be sufficient to hide from them. \n\nAnd massing doesn't mean parking together. Units can mass to prepare for an offensive without looking like a Disney World parking lot. They can be many miles apart from each other and doing their best to remain hidden. \n\nAssault units don't even need to park near the front lines to shortly go on the offensive, they're not actually walking to the fight, are they? With interior lines of communication, motorized vehicles can drive to the locations they plan to attack pretty quickly. For reference, it's 150 kilometers from Dnipro to Orikhiv, they can do that road march in a day and then launch the attack with strategic surprise. Or anywhere else. \n\nAnother thing they can do is deliberately use deception regarding units likely to be used in the offensive, especially those many think will be used for the main effort. The 47th has Bradleys and the 82nd has Strykers, according to the leaks? Okay, switch out. Or better yet, they keep the vehicles but don't use them for the main effort, at least not at the beginning, keep them as the second echelon force but used as part of a deception plan to fool the Russians into misjudging where the main effort actually is.\n\nWhat blows my mind is the Ukrainians have full support of their own press and most of the West's, plus most western govts. Why not use that most impressive resource to plant bullshit stories as part of deception plans? Why not do a full on pantomime? Why not literally rewrite the book on deception? They're too honest to try? \n\nRemember in April when Ukraine was bitching about delaying their offensive until they got more ammo? And then said they were ready to [launch it soon](https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/13/asia/zelensky-ukraine-counteroffensive-germany-italy-intl-hnk/index.html)? Why didn't they double down and say they didn't get enough ammo and still weren't ready? \n\nWhy not engineer a fake argument between Biden and Zelensky that risks the future alliance? What, not believable? Why not have Zaluzhny fake a heart attack? Why not fake fire Zaluzhny on the eve? Why not do a thousand and one things that are options when you control the greatest information operations capability in modern military history to use for deception? \n\nToo honest? What, lying is impossible in 2023? \n\n>Who says they wouldn't be having the exact same kind of fight as the south?\n\nBecause the Russians didn't prepare the whole of Ukraine like they did the South. They didn't even reinforce the Velyka Novosilkav-Berdyansk axis defenses nearly as strongly as the Orikhiv-Tokmak-Melitipol axis, which has three distinct defensive lines behind the forward security zone, which is two more than most of the rest of the country (Svatove-Kreminna line has multiple). \n\n>Russia isn't even defending at their prepared defences yet, they are Fighting in front of them same as they would be doing in the north.\n\nThey're defending at prepared positions, the lines in the South barely moved since last March. What can be called the outpost line or the security zone, the current Grey Line, is still highly defended, just not as stoutly as the Surovikin Line defenses behind it. \n\nBut more so, the Russians are massed in the South, lots of prepared units fighting from prepared positions, and using a prepared defensive doctrine crafted half a year ago because they knew the Ukrainians were going to attack there, because they said so and then made every indication to show it was real, and then didn't make it a deception plan/feint. \n\n>Why do you keep comparing the Eastern Front to present day? \n\nI'm not the one who brought up Kursk, Zaluzhny supposedly did. \n\nAnd while troop levels are different, the principles of war don't change because of the number of troops per kilometer of frontage. They're called the principles of war cause they are \"rules and guidelines that represent truths in the practice of war.\"\n\n>You talk about stealth and surprise as if it's easy or even possible to achieve\n\nAnd you talk about it like it's impossible. \n\nStrategic surprise was achieved NUMEROUS times in this war, even when it was pretty f'n obvious. The invasion of Ukraine wasn't exactly hidden, was it?

                        "body": "> The fact that Kim Jong Un has managed to balance all of the competing issues and moved through the leadership transition seems to be pretty decent proof that he's both plenty sane and rational. \n\nI have trouble with this theory. The main one being that \"they want to stay in power.\" Leaders are people, and are thus complicated just like people. They have complicated emotions, motivations, MO, etc. \n\nMy belief is that leaders have motivations, and they will stay true to those motivations. Their motivations may be to stay in power. They could also be to stay in power to achieve some goal. \n\nFor Putin, it seems pretty clear that his goal of staying in power is to re-build the soviet empire. The main argument for this is that if he just wanted to stay in power, he had no major reason to invade Ukraine. \n\nFor Kim Jong Un, his motivations are quite important in this regard. Is his motivation to just stay in power? If so, then yes, he would not be focused on actually using the nuclear weapons. Just about any case of using the nuclear weapons leads to Kim Jung Un getting a nuclear response, which will ultimately destroy his country.\n\nI don't look at the madman theory as \"This madman will do something insane because they are unpredictable.\" Instead, it's more like \"Madman is going to act insane to convince the enemy that madman is insane, so enemy will do anything to appease madman.\" The madman theory only works if you are threatening real violence. If Kim Jung Un can threaten violence, then it works. If he can't, then he's just an annoyance. \n\nHow effective is the madman theory? I'd say it is. Nazi Germany showed that pretty well before ww2 in that they were able to get concessions and appeasements from their neighbors. So has Putin before Ukraine. The problem with being a madman is that eventually someone will call the madman's bluff, and then the madman has to follow through with the madman theory - aka war or appear weak. Ukraine essentially called Russia's bluff and now they are stuck and Russia can't get any appeasement.\n\nIn my opinion, Putin's motivations are to maintain power to build the soviet empire. Using nuclear weapons are contrary to that motivation. So if my theory of Putin is correct, Putin would NEVER preemptively use nuclear weapons because any use of them would lead to the collapse of the Russian empire. However, if the Russian empire is already destroyed, that theory of Putin gets really muddled. How would he react if Russia starts to fall apart? I don't have a good answer for that. \n\nAs you can imagine, looking over the madman theory, it is quite dangerous with Kim Jong Un. I don't think we have a solid grasp of his motivations. Staying in power is definitely the main motivation. But is there another end? I would believe that there is, otherwise he'd have no reason to build insane numbers of nuclear weapons. Otherwise, he could build something like 25-50 and use them primarily for defense and sell the rest on the international market. The fact is, it looks like NK is looking to build hundreds of nuclear weapons and delivery vehicles for domestic consumption. That's not a defensive strategy. \n\nComing back to the madman theory, here is what I'd expect. Kim Jong Un will use nuclear weapons to gain appeasements from SK, Japan, China or whoever. And those appeasements will work for a little while under the guise of peace. That will create a bolder Kim Jong Un who will eventually be called out on his bluff. When he is called out, he's left with a dilemma, appear weak like Putin or follow through with the threat. If his motivations are to maintain power in NK, then the obvious course of action is to just back down. \n\nThe problem comes up if his motivations are NOT to just stay in power. If his motivations are to become respected on the international stage, a call on his bluff could be completely demoralizing to him and make him suicidal. In that case, the likelihood of him using nuclear weapons in a first strike context goes way up. \n\nThe bottom line is this, building a lot of nuclear weapons puts NK in a dangerous situation and at a much higher likelihood of using those Nuclear weapons.",

War losses aren't a concern for Russia (for the most part). Anyone with significant engineering expertise was drafted to work in military production, not on the frontline.\n\n> will they be able to muster a good force in the future and learn from the past?\n\nDepends on whether they get serious about rooting out corruption. I expect they would definitely end up with a qualitative improvement on current systems simply because they have so much combat experience and data to draw on. We've seen newer versions of T72s and T90s include ERA upgrade packages to specifically address vulnerabilities on those platforms that were exposed in combat. \n\nBut ultimately they lack the R&D expertise to build entirely new systems, so it will still be incremental advances on current platforms, except for drones, where systems like the Lancet and the other ZALA platforms have shown to be pretty cost-effective and arguably better per $ than US equivalents like Switchblade. \n\n> Will a fleet of good modern tanks, SPAA, self propelled artillery and regular tubes be possible?\n\nDepends on the size of this \"fleet\". They're never rebuilding back to the number of the Soviet stockpile, but if they reconsidered their goals they could end rebuild a comparable force to the British/French/Italians i.e. small numbers of reasonably modern systems.\n\n> And of course a fleet of modern planes with good systems.\n\nThe VKS is largely intact, most of the losses have been older planes, like SU-24/SU-25/SU-30. They have lost a significant number of SU-34s and a handful of SU-35s, but the VKS will remain a potent air-force for the forseeable future. \n\nOf course the \"good systems\" part of this equation leaves something to be desired. In a war against a NATO adversary they have nothing that can match the F-35, at very best their latest jets are at parity with systems like the the F15-EX. The gap between stealth and non-stealth jets is so large that unless they start buying J-20s I don't see the VKs fielding \"modern planes with good systems\" in the forseeable future.",
