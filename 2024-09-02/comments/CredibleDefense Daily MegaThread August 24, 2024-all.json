        "body": "Final days of u/To_control_yourself training. In total the whole mobilization process took 78 days with 35 days of training. \n \n\n[Day 31](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ukraine_UA/comments/1exmatq/\u043c\u043e\u0431\u0456\u043b\u0456\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0456\u044f_\u043c\u0456\u0439_\u0448\u043b\u044f\u0445_\u0432\u0456\u0434_\u0446\u0438\u0432\u0456\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e_\u0434\u043e/)\n\n\nHe started his final tactical exams. This exam consists of simulated battle where he has to hold his observation post. He notes how observation actually mostly consists of listening rather than watching. Furthermore he says that he made a mistake by taking too much gear with him as he didn't think that he would have to walk for so long. \nHe also says that for these three days they won't be provided with food from the canteen rather they will have to utilize mres. \n\nThey prepared their position by choosing a dependable place, digged in and tried to mask it.  [On his website he has a picture of his sleeping place](https://learn-to-control-yourself.com/mobilizaciya-mij-shlyah-vid-civilnogo-do-vijskovosluzhbovcya-19-08-2024/)\n\nNotably for communications he uses some kind of  messenger app (likely signal). \n\nThey also have to hide from the drones. If a drone is able to drop something on them a person who is hit is considered wounded and needs to be evacuated. His team already has five wounded. \n\nHe also notes that despite the fact that attacks in the real war usually happen between 3 am and 5 am during training due to proximity of a civilian settlement they have to be quite between 11pm and 5am. \n\nTheir position was attacked at 9pm and it lasted until 11pm.\n\nOverall he describes his experience as chaotic and realistic. Overall he also highlights the importance of communication to prevent friendly fire. \n\n\n\n[Day 32](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ukraine_UA/comments/1eyotoj/\u043c\u043e\u0431\u0456\u043b\u0456\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0456\u044f_\u043c\u0456\u0439_\u0448\u043b\u044f\u0445_\u0432\u0456\u0434_\u0446\u0438\u0432\u0456\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e_\u0434\u043e/)\n\nThey had no break from the previous day. He again talks about how sleep is important and how people utilized everything possible to stay awake. Since the last day they had to move a couple of kilometers to a different position. There they had some practical lessons on tacmed and different types of CASEVAC.\n\nNext they learned about how to use grandes to clear buildings. However their instructors said that it's rare to this in real life as small buildings are usually fully obliterated with artillery. \n\nHe also notes how by this point everyone stank. \n\nLater they practiced storming positions using strike ball guns.  He notes that since his last training there were noticeable improvements but some issues remained.\n\nOne of the issues is again the command structure but also continuity of the command. He notes that he overly relied on his commander so that when the commander got shot he didn't know what to do. However when he was left alone he took initiative and attacked an enemy controlled building hold taking some of them out before getting shot. \n\nDuring his second game, while better prepared his commander disappeared, and his team needed to decide what to do. They ended up storming a basement and actually winning even though only three people from his team remained alive. \n\n\n\n\n[Day 33](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ukraine_UA/comments/1ez7i7d/\u043c\u043e\u0431\u0456\u043b\u0456\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0456\u044f_\u043c\u0456\u0439_\u0448\u043b\u044f\u0445_\u0432\u0456\u0434_\u0446\u0438\u0432\u0456\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e_\u0434\u043e/)\n\n\nThis was his last tactical exam day. First they had to storm and clear trenches. The legend for thos exercise was that the enemy retreated but a couple of combatants remained in the trenches. They had to clear them out using groups of 7-8 people. Notably they had to use gas masks during this exercise. \n\nAfter that they had to go through an obstacle course while getting shot at.\n\nNext they had to practice covering fire.in pairs. One of them would shoot while the other one runs for cover. The had to both advance and retreat.\n\nThey also practiced shooting down low flying drones. Most missed and the instructor said that the lesson is that it's extremely hard to shoot down drones. So it's usually better to not give away your position and hide from the drones. \n\nFinally they had to find and mark the mines. \n\n\n[Day 34](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ukraine_UA/comments/1ezdv29/\u043c\u043e\u0431\u0456\u043b\u0456\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0456\u044f_\u043c\u0456\u0439_\u0448\u043b\u044f\u0445_\u0432\u0456\u0434_\u0446\u0438\u0432\u0456\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e_\u0434\u043e/)\n\n\nHere he mostly talks about his overall thoughts about his training. He says that he mostly had a positive experience and that unlike before the war people there know why they are there. He also notes that relationship between the new recruits and trainers was somewhat casual. They didn't practice marching and didn't need to salute anyone.\n\n\n\n[Day 35](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ukraine_UA/comments/1f01sqv/\u043c\u043e\u0431\u0456\u043b\u0456\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0456\u044f_\u043c\u0456\u0439_\u0448\u043b\u044f\u0445_\u0432\u0456\u0434_\u0446\u0438\u0432\u0456\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e_\u0434\u043e/)\n\n\n\nThis was his last day in the training center. From here they were deployed to the units that they previously signed up with. He notes that everyone who signed the contract got the position that they signed up for.\n\n\n[His website](https://learn-to-control-yourself.com/mij-blog-pro-mobilizaciyu-kontrakt-i-podalshu-vijskovu-sluzhbu/)\n\n---\n\nPrevious summaries:\n\n[Days 28-30](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/s/IbdgFKT6Ot)\n\n[Days 24-27](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/s/AKveFfuLo8)\n\n[Days 13-22](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/s/ClEn7cA0OO)\n\n[More training](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/s/5gc6CzzgjA)\n\n[First days of training](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/s/yKbcUeS3Cz)\n\n[Getting mobilized](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/s/g9f6cVvjkZ)",

The Air Assault Forces have their own Training Center and the training there is of good quality, as far as I know. In regards to the mechanized brigades, and in the Ground Forces in general, the whole thing is much more hit and miss; there are good brigades, decent ones and third-rate ones. For those who have time, I recommend reading the posts from early July onward by Roman Donik, an instructor at the 151st Training Center of the Ground Forces, who denounces the many problems there are with training in the UAF.\n\nhttps://t. me/romandonik\n\nAmong them: a part of the instructors in some centers are incompetent - which he says is due to the fact that the certifications to be an instructor are all issued in Desna (where the 169th Training Center is located), under strict control of the Chief Sergeant of Training in the Ground Forces (although fortunately the head of the 169th Center was replaced recently); this leads to the fact that some of the recruits finish training with not-good skills, which is something that needs to be solved by the brigades to which they are assigned. Donik also stated, from his point of view as a serviceman of a Training Center, that combat brigades don't have the means and the specialists to provide comprehensive training and should have a more constructive attitude with Training Centers. He also strongly criticizes the system of Chief Sergeants in the UAF, which are a kind of \"caste\", far worse than Generals, in his view.\n\nBut there is also the fact that certain brigade and OTG commanders pressure the instructors from the Training Centers in order to receive recruits who are not ready yet (which risks making them avoidable casualties in the front line), forcing the instructors to forge exit checks, where the recruit is examined and from there can go on to perform combat duties in a military unit only if the required skills are assessed as satisfactory. Then there is the phenomenon that brigades, particularly TDF ones, are very reluctant to send their men to training centers - whether it's for a course to make them sergeants, officers or experts in certain specialties. The reason is that it may happen, and it happens a lot with TDF brigades, that those who take these courses are then sent to other brigades (e.g. of the Ground Forces) - but the fact that they are not let go is indeed a net loss for the UAF, overall.",

Something like the Israeli Shaldag or Swedish Combat Boat 90. They are relatively cheap compared to jets, can loiter for a long time, and have most cost effective means against asymmetric threat (eg Spike missiles against an ATGM unit instead of a tomahawk).

Let\u2019s assume they can keep them supplied by 100 trucks just for the math.\n\nDouble the amount of troops and go 150km in, and you\u2019re not going to need 2x the trucks.

Even assuming the same EW/anti-drone coverage they\u2019ve also got an area about 4-6x as large and the trucks are exposed for 4x as long.</p>\n\n<p>So you need 8x as many trucks as they\u2019re currently using, 4x as much anti-drone/anti-air and the trucks are even so still exposed for 4x as long as they are now (also giving longer response times to get fpv drones to them directed by loitering drones). If they used 10x the number of troops and APCs as you\u2019re suggesting that\u2019s 80x the number of trucks and tankers needed to keep them supplied at the outskirts of Kursk. Even if they have 10x the troops they definierely don\u2019t have 80x the trucks.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s the size x distance that means the logistics are likely to run out well before the troops numbers do. To short circuit this equation they need rail lines, or at the very least, safe and well maintained tarmac highways (which means that at least some of the 80x trucks can be civilian models).</p>\n</div>",

From what I gathered, however, we&#39;d have no idea about any of this if it was running on-schedule and on-budget, so don&#39;t expect to hear much on it any time soon.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aviationweek.com/defense-space/aircraft-propulsion/debrief-our-best-guess-about-skunk-works-biggest-secret\">https://aviationweek.com/defense-space/aircraft-propulsion/debrief-our-best-guess-about-skunk-works-biggest-secret</a></p>\n</div>",

I should point out that just because there were Pierre Spreys of the world does not mean there have been and are very very real problems in the program and with the plane.\n\nRegarding not safely flyable: DCMA (Defense Contract Management Agency) in conjunction with the JPO and DOD ceased acceptance of all Tech Refresh 3 jets last year because the software was literally unflyable. Without DCMA acceptance, Lockheed stopped getting paid on the delivery of the jets, which hit their execs where they could no longer ignore: [the bottom line](https://www.defensenews.com/industry/2024/01/23/upgraded-f-35-deliveries-slipping-to-fall-2024-lockheed-says/)\n\nThis decision was the culmination of years of Lockheed overpromising and not delivering on a basic functional flying airplane.\n\nThey finally came to an agreement to help clear the backlog of jets on the ramp (last count, 90+ were in storage) to fly a truncated software build for TR3 jets that was only [designed to be safe to fly](https://www.airandspaceforces.com/f-35-deliveries-can-resume-immediately-truncated-software/) with a lot of missing capabilities:\n\n>Lt. Gen. Michael J. Schmidt, F-35 program executive officer, has approved use of \u201ctruncated\u201d Tech Refresh 3 software, clearing the way for deliveries of more than 90 F-35s sitting in storage to U.S. military services and foreign users, the Joint Program Office announced July 11.\n\nand\n\n>A few months ago, manufacturer Lockheed Martin and the JPO agreed to accept a \u201ctruncated\u201d version of TR-3 to get deliveries going again. The F-35 steering group\u2014comprised of partners and users of the multiservice, multinational fighter\u2014approved the plan to release jets with an incomplete TR-3 software package.\n\n>**Yet Schmidt had been waiting for clear evidence that the truncated software is stable and safe for flight. Test pilots reported as recently as May that the software was still unstable and required in-flight rebooting multiple times per sortie.**\n\nThese jets are being delivered only to training commands (to do basic familiarization flights) and are not combat capable. Lockheed is promising to get it fixed by next year, but I'm not holding my breath on that one: in 2018, TR3 was supposed to be delivered in 2021, and here we are in 2024 finally getting a *barely* flyable TR3 software with most of the combat capability still TBD\n\nRegarding Congress: the topic is on seizing intellectual property.\n\nAnd yes, plenty of credible sources and articles on this. [The House Armed Services Committe](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/4754671-congress-f-35-program-problems/) openly touted an amendment to the NDAA to seize the intellectual property of the F-35:\n\n>At the HASC markup of the NDAA in May, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle expressed grievances with the F-35 program and debated whether to take the drastic step of seizing the intellectual property of the fighter jet from Lockheed. \n\n>Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) said at the markup the F-35 was \u201cbroken\u201d and that it was a \u201cfundamental issue\u201d that Lockheed has control over the program through the original contract. \n\n>Taking the intellectual property of the F-35 would address the software issues with TR-3, he argued. \n\n>\u201cIt\u2019s a shame because we have a lot of extraordinary software developers in America, but we can\u2019t allow them to work on this program because Lockheed refuses to give up the intellectual property,\u201d he said.  \n\n>The amendment was withdrawn over Congressional Budget Office concerns on how to pay for it. Lawmakers also raised questions about the legality of seizing intellectual property. But during the conversations, even Republicans aired mounting concerns about the program.  \n\n>\u201cThe F-35 has kind of walked itself into a position where, I don\u2019t want to say a dead end, but it\u2019s in a position that we need competition, we need this software, we need to have the ability to put those assets overhead, and right now that\u2019s just not happening,\u201d said Rep. Morgan Luttrell (R-Texas). \n\n>\u201cI hope Lockheed is listening because we are seriously paying attention to this,\u201d he added. \n\nThis is all public record. \n\nThe current SECAF would agree with this, [having called this acquisition malpractice at one point](https://defensescoop.com/2023/05/22/kendall-vows-air-force-ngad-program-wont-repeat-serious-mistake-associated-with-the-f-35/):\n\n>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to repeat the \u2014 what I think, quite frankly, was a serious mistake that was made in the F-35 program of doing something which \u2026 came from an era which we had something called \u2018total system performance.\u2019 And the theory then was when a contractor won a program, they owned the program [and] it was going to do the whole lifecycle of the program \u2026 What that basically does is create a perpetual monopoly. And I spent years struggling to overcome acquisition malpractice, and we\u2019re still struggling with that to some degree,\u201d Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall told reporters during a Defense Writers Group meeting.\n\nThere's the former JPO head, Lt Gen (ret.) Bogdan, whose interview on 60 Minutes [is quite the listen](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/weapons-contractors-price-gouging-pentagon-60-minutes-transcript-2023-05-21/): \n\n>General Bogdan says we've only begun to feel the full impact. In 2012, he was tapped to take the reins of the troubled F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program \u2013  it was seven years behind schedule and $90 billion over the original estimate. But Bogdan told us the biggest costs are yet to come for support and maintenance, which could end up costing taxpayers $1.3 trillion.  \n\n>Chris Bogdan: We won't be able to buy as many F-35s as we thought. Because it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to buy air-- more airplanes when you can't afford the ones you have.\n\n>The Pentagon had ceded control of the program to Lockheed Martin. The contractor is delivering the aircraft the Pentagon paid to design and build, but under the contract, Lockheed and its suppliers retained control of design and repair data \u2013 the proprietary information needed to fix and upgrade the plane.\n\n>Bill Whitaker: So you spend billions and billions of dollars to get this plane built. And it doesn't actually belong to the Department of Defense?\n\n>Chris Bogdan: The weapon system belongs to the department. But the data underlying the design of the airplane does not.\n\n>Bill Whitaker: We can't maintain and sustain the planes without Lockheed's--\n\n>Chris Bogdan: Correct. And that's because-- that's because we didn't-- we didn't up front either buy or negotiate getting the-- the technical data we needed so that when a part breaks, the DOD can fix it themselves.\n\nIf the existing vendor cannot deliver what is promised, which is resulting in Block 4 capabilities [being cut down](https://breakingdefense.com/2024/04/f-35-program-could-reshuffle-long-term-upgrade-plan-deliver-tr-3-jets-early-without-full-capability/) and deferred to the 2030s (still TBD on what exact subsets, but it's happening), what recourse is left?\n\n>Both pieces of news came from F-35 program lead Air Force Lt. Gen. Mike Schmidt, during today\u2019s testimony in front of the House Armed Services tactical air and land forces subcommittee. In written remarks, Schmidt explained that an independent review last year determined that \u201cnumerous Block 4 capabilities will not deliver until the 2030s\u201d \u2014 years later than a recent estimate offered by congressional auditors \u2014 prompting the program to \u201creimagine\u201d the Block 4 upgrade altogether. \n\n>The newly-envisioned Block 4 would instead focus on delivering \u201c\u2018must-have\u2019 content,\u201d Schmidt wrote, which will include an undefined \u201csubset\u201d of 88 capabilities originally approved as part of the Block 4 plan. \u201cReimagined Block 4 must consist of \u2018what industry can actually deliver\u2019 across the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP),\u201d Schmidt wrote, and will likely consist of traits like enhanced electronic warfare and communications capabilities.\n\n>The issue has not been decided, Schmidt wrote, and requires buy-in from all members of the F-35 enterprise. Additionally, Schmidt wrote the F-35 program has established new \u201ccapability decision points\u201d (CDP) to ensure certain hardware and software can go out to the fleet, emphasizing that program officials are \u201cconfident\u201d in Block 4 deliveries associated with those CDPs. \n\n>The F-35 program will lay out the new Block 4 approach in \u201ca combat relevant timeframe with yes a subset of capabilities of the Block 4 program, but those which give us the most bang for the buck,\u201d Schmidt said in response to a question from subcommittee Chairman Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Va.\n\nKeep in mind too, that the current CJCS (then CSAF) said [this](https://www.airandspaceforces.com/ngad-multirole-fighter-f-35-block-4/) a couple years ago:\n\n>\u201cThe F-35 we have today is not necessarily the F-35 we want to have that goes into the future, that will have Tech Refresh 3 and Block 4 against an advancing \u2026 Chinese threat,\u201d Brown said.\n\nSo if Block IV is late and losing capabilities, and Block IV was supposed to be what they actually want for F-35, again I ask - what recourse do we have? Keep pressing with a vendor failing at its job? \n\nAgain, just because where were some Pierre Sprey followers out there, does not invalidate that there are very credible criticisms from very credible authorities on the program and the airplane, both within and outside the DOD. This is just what has become very very public recently",

I should point out that just because there were Pierre Spreys of the world does not mean there have been and are very very real problems in the program and with the plane.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding not safely flyable: DCMA (Defense Contract Management Agency) in conjunction with the JPO and DOD ceased acceptance of all Tech Refresh 3 jets last year because the software was literally unflyable. Without DCMA acceptance, Lockheed stopped getting paid on the delivery of the jets, which hit their execs where they could no longer ignore: <a href=\"https://www.defensenews.com/industry/2024/01/23/upgraded-f-35-deliveries-slipping-to-fall-2024-lockheed-says/\">the bottom line</a></p>\n\n<p>This decision was the culmination of years of Lockheed overpromising and not delivering on a basic functional flying airplane.</p>\n\n<p>They finally came to an agreement to help clear the backlog of jets on the ramp (last count, 90+ were in storage) to fly a truncated software build for TR3 jets that was only <a href=\"https://www.airandspaceforces.com/f-35-deliveries-can-resume-immediately-truncated-software/\">designed to be safe to fly</a> with a lot of missing capabilities:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Lt. Gen. Michael J. Schmidt, F-35 program executive officer, has approved use of \u201ctruncated\u201d Tech Refresh 3 software, clearing the way for deliveries of more than 90 F-35s sitting in storage to U.S. military services and foreign users, the Joint Program Office announced July 11.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>A few months ago, manufacturer Lockheed Martin and the JPO agreed to accept a \u201ctruncated\u201d version of TR-3 to get deliveries going again. The F-35 steering group\u2014comprised of partners and users of the multiservice, multinational fighter\u2014approved the plan to release jets with an incomplete TR-3 software package.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Yet Schmidt had been waiting for clear evidence that the truncated software is stable and safe for flight. Test pilots reported as recently as May that the software was still unstable and required in-flight rebooting multiple times per sortie.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These jets are being delivered only to training commands (to do basic familiarization flights) and are not combat capable. Lockheed is promising to get it fixed by next year, but I&#39;m not holding my breath on that one: in 2018, TR3 was supposed to be delivered in 2021, and here we are in 2024 finally getting a <em>barely</em> flyable TR3 software with most of the combat capability still TBD</p>\n\n<p>Regarding Congress: the topic is on seizing intellectual property.</p>\n\n<p>And yes, plenty of credible sources and articles on this. <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/4754671-congress-f-35-program-problems/\">The House Armed Services Committe</a> openly touted an amendment to the NDAA to seize the intellectual property of the F-35:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>At the HASC markup of the NDAA in May, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle expressed grievances with the F-35 program and debated whether to take the drastic step of seizing the intellectual property of the fighter jet from Lockheed. </p>\n\n<p>Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) said at the markup the F-35 was \u201cbroken\u201d and that it was a \u201cfundamental issue\u201d that Lockheed has control over the program through the original contract. </p>\n\n<p>Taking the intellectual property of the F-35 would address the software issues with TR-3, he argued. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a shame because we have a lot of extraordinary software developers in America, but we can\u2019t allow them to work on this program because Lockheed refuses to give up the intellectual property,\u201d he said.  </p>\n\n<p>The amendment was withdrawn over Congressional Budget Office concerns on how to pay for it. Lawmakers also raised questions about the legality of seizing intellectual property. But during the conversations, even Republicans aired mounting concerns about the program.  </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe F-35 has kind of walked itself into a position where, I don\u2019t want to say a dead end, but it\u2019s in a position that we need competition, we need this software, we need to have the ability to put those assets overhead, and right now that\u2019s just not happening,\u201d said Rep. Morgan Luttrell (R-Texas). </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI hope Lockheed is listening because we are seriously paying attention to this,\u201d he added. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is all public record. </p>\n\n<p>The current SECAF would agree with this, <a href=\"https://defensescoop.com/2023/05/22/kendall-vows-air-force-ngad-program-wont-repeat-serious-mistake-associated-with-the-f-35/\">having called this acquisition malpractice at one point</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to repeat the \u2014 what I think, quite frankly, was a serious mistake that was made in the F-35 program of doing something which \u2026 came from an era which we had something called \u2018total system performance.\u2019 And the theory then was when a contractor won a program, they owned the program [and] it was going to do the whole lifecycle of the program \u2026 What that basically does is create a perpetual monopoly. And I spent years struggling to overcome acquisition malpractice, and we\u2019re still struggling with that to some degree,\u201d Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall told reporters during a Defense Writers Group meeting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There&#39;s the former JPO head, Lt Gen (ret.) Bogdan, whose interview on 60 Minutes <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/weapons-contractors-price-gouging-pentagon-60-minutes-transcript-2023-05-21/\">is quite the listen</a>: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>General Bogdan says we&#39;ve only begun to feel the full impact. In 2012, he was tapped to take the reins of the troubled F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program \u2013  it was seven years behind schedule and $90 billion over the original estimate. But Bogdan told us the biggest costs are yet to come for support and maintenance, which could end up costing taxpayers $1.3 trillion.  </p>\n\n<p>Chris Bogdan: We won&#39;t be able to buy as many F-35s as we thought. Because it doesn&#39;t make a whole lot of sense to buy air-- more airplanes when you can&#39;t afford the ones you have.</p>\n\n<p>The Pentagon had ceded control of the program to Lockheed Martin. The contractor is delivering the aircraft the Pentagon paid to design and build, but under the contract, Lockheed and its suppliers retained control of design and repair data \u2013 the proprietary information needed to fix and upgrade the plane.</p>\n\n<p>Bill Whitaker: So you spend billions and billions of dollars to get this plane built. And it doesn&#39;t actually belong to the Department of Defense?</p>\n\n<p>Chris Bogdan: The weapon system belongs to the department. But the data underlying the design of the airplane does not.</p>\n\n<p>Bill Whitaker: We can&#39;t maintain and sustain the planes without Lockheed&#39;s--</p>\n\n<p>Chris Bogdan: Correct. And that&#39;s because-- that&#39;s because we didn&#39;t-- we didn&#39;t up front either buy or negotiate getting the-- the technical data we needed so that when a part breaks, the DOD can fix it themselves.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If the existing vendor cannot deliver what is promised, which is resulting in Block 4 capabilities <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2024/04/f-35-program-could-reshuffle-long-term-upgrade-plan-deliver-tr-3-jets-early-without-full-capability/\">being cut down</a> and deferred to the 2030s (still TBD on what exact subsets, but it&#39;s happening), what recourse is left?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Both pieces of news came from F-35 program lead Air Force Lt. Gen. Mike Schmidt, during today\u2019s testimony in front of the House Armed Services tactical air and land forces subcommittee. In written remarks, Schmidt explained that an independent review last year determined that \u201cnumerous Block 4 capabilities will not deliver until the 2030s\u201d \u2014 years later than a recent estimate offered by congressional auditors \u2014 prompting the program to \u201creimagine\u201d the Block 4 upgrade altogether. </p>\n\n<p>The newly-envisioned Block 4 would instead focus on delivering \u201c\u2018must-have\u2019 content,\u201d Schmidt wrote, which will include an undefined \u201csubset\u201d of 88 capabilities originally approved as part of the Block 4 plan. \u201cReimagined Block 4 must consist of \u2018what industry can actually deliver\u2019 across the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP),\u201d Schmidt wrote, and will likely consist of traits like enhanced electronic warfare and communications capabilities.</p>\n\n<p>The issue has not been decided, Schmidt wrote, and requires buy-in from all members of the F-35 enterprise. Additionally, Schmidt wrote the F-35 program has established new \u201ccapability decision points\u201d (CDP) to ensure certain hardware and software can go out to the fleet, emphasizing that program officials are \u201cconfident\u201d in Block 4 deliveries associated with those CDPs. </p>\n\n<p>The F-35 program will lay out the new Block 4 approach in \u201ca combat relevant timeframe with yes a subset of capabilities of the Block 4 program, but those which give us the most bang for the buck,\u201d Schmidt said in response to a question from subcommittee Chairman Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Va.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Keep in mind too, that the current CJCS (then CSAF) said <a href=\"https://www.airandspaceforces.com/ngad-multirole-fighter-f-35-block-4/\">this</a> a couple years ago:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cThe F-35 we have today is not necessarily the F-35 we want to have that goes into the future, that will have Tech Refresh 3 and Block 4 against an advancing \u2026 Chinese threat,\u201d Brown said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So if Block IV is late and losing capabilities, and Block IV was supposed to be what they actually want for F-35, again I ask - what recourse do we have? Keep pressing with a vendor failing at its job? </p>\n\n<p>Again, just because where were some Pierre Sprey followers out there, does not invalidate that there are very credible criticisms from very credible authorities on the program and the airplane, both within and outside the DOD. This is just what has become very very public recently</p>\n</div>",

Lockheed is promising to get it fixed next year, but I'm not holding my breath on that one: in 2018, TR3 was supposed to be delivered in 2021, and here we are in 2024 finally getting a *barely* flyable TR3 software with most of the combat capability still TBD\n\n>Changing vendors as a result is extremely unlikely and would likely be disastrous for the program.\n\nIf the existing vendor cannot deliver what is promised, which is resulting in Block 4 capabilities [being cut down](https://breakingdefense.com/2024/04/f-35-program-could-reshuffle-long-term-upgrade-plan-deliver-tr-3-jets-early-without-full-capability/) and deferred to the 2030s (still TBD on what exact subsets, but it's happening), is that any better?\n\n>Both pieces of news came from F-35 program lead Air Force Lt. Gen. Mike Schmidt, during today\u2019s testimony in front of the House Armed Services tactical air and land forces subcommittee. In written remarks, Schmidt explained that an independent review last year determined that \u201cnumerous Block 4 capabilities will not deliver until the 2030s\u201d \u2014 years later than a recent estimate offered by congressional auditors \u2014 prompting the program to \u201creimagine\u201d the Block 4 upgrade altogether. \n\n>The newly-envisioned Block 4 would instead focus on delivering \u201c\u2018must-have\u2019 content,\u201d Schmidt wrote, which will include an undefined \u201csubset\u201d of 88 capabilities originally approved as part of the Block 4 plan. \u201cReimagined Block 4 must consist of \u2018what industry can actually deliver\u2019 across the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP),\u201d Schmidt wrote, and will likely consist of traits like enhanced electronic warfare and communications capabilities.\n\n>The issue has not been decided, Schmidt wrote, and requires buy-in from all members of the F-35 enterprise. Additionally, Schmidt wrote the F-35 program has established new \u201ccapability decision points\u201d (CDP) to ensure certain hardware and software can go out to the fleet, emphasizing that program officials are \u201cconfident\u201d in Block 4 deliveries associated with those CDPs. \n\n>The F-35 program will lay out the new Block 4 approach in \u201ca combat relevant timeframe with yes a subset of capabilities of the Block 4 program, but those which give us the most bang for the buck,\u201d Schmidt said in response to a question from subcommittee Chairman Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Va.\n\nKeep in mind too, that the current CJCS (then CSAF) said [this](https://www.airandspaceforces.com/ngad-multirole-fighter-f-35-block-4/) a couple years ago:\n\n>\u201cThe F-35 we have today is not necessarily the F-35 we want to have that goes into the future, that will have Tech Refresh 3 and Block 4 against an advancing \u2026 Chinese threat,\u201d Brown said.\n\nSo if Block IV is late and losing capabilities, and Block IV was supposed to be what they actually want for F-35, again I ask - what recourse do we have? Keep pressing with a vendor failing at its job? \n\n> Is there any credible source or article on this or are these claims mostly from social media?\n\nYes, plenty of credible sources and articles on this. [The House Armed Services Committe](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/4754671-congress-f-35-program-problems/) openly touted an amendment to the NDAA to seize the intellectual property of the F-35:\n\n>At the HASC markup of the NDAA in May, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle expressed grievances with the F-35 program and debated whether to take the drastic step of seizing the intellectual property of the fighter jet from Lockheed. \n\n>Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) said at the markup the F-35 was \u201cbroken\u201d and that it was a \u201cfundamental issue\u201d that Lockheed has control over the program through the original contract. \n\n>Taking the intellectual property of the F-35 would address the software issues with TR-3, he argued. \n\n>\u201cIt\u2019s a shame because we have a lot of extraordinary software developers in America, but we can\u2019t allow them to work on this program because Lockheed refuses to give up the intellectual property,\u201d he said.  \n\n>The amendment was withdrawn over Congressional Budget Office concerns on how to pay for it. Lawmakers also raised questions about the legality of seizing intellectual property. But during the conversations, even Republicans aired mounting concerns about the program.  \n\n>\u201cThe F-35 has kind of walked itself into a position where, I don\u2019t want to say a dead end, but it\u2019s in a position that we need competition, we need this software, we need to have the ability to put those assets overhead, and right now that\u2019s just not happening,\u201d said Rep. Morgan Luttrell (R-Texas). \n\n>\u201cI hope Lockheed is listening because we are seriously paying attention to this,\u201d he added. \n\nSECAF would agree with this, [having called this acquisition malpractice at one point](https://defensescoop.com/2023/05/22/kendall-vows-air-force-ngad-program-wont-repeat-serious-mistake-associated-with-the-f-35/):\n\n>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to repeat the \u2014 what I think, quite frankly, was a serious mistake that was made in the F-35 program of doing something which \u2026 came from an era which we had something called \u2018total system performance.\u2019 And the theory then was when a contractor won a program, they owned the program [and] it was going to do the whole lifecycle of the program \u2026 What that basically does is create a perpetual monopoly. And I spent years struggling to overcome acquisition malpractice, and we\u2019re still struggling with that to some degree,\u201d Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall told reporters during a Defense Writers Group meeting.\n\nI could go on and on. There's the former JPO head, Lt Gen (ret.) Bogdan, whose interview on 60 Minutes [is quite the listen](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/weapons-contractors-price-gouging-pentagon-60-minutes-transcript-2023-05-21/): \n\n>General Bogdan says we've only begun to feel the full impact. In 2012, he was tapped to take the reins of the troubled F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program \u2013  it was seven years behind schedule and $90 billion over the original estimate. But Bogdan told us the biggest costs are yet to come for support and maintenance, which could end up costing taxpayers $1.3 trillion.  \n\n>Chris Bogdan: We won't be able to buy as many F-35s as we thought. Because it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to buy air-- more airplanes when you can't afford the ones you have.\n\n>The Pentagon had ceded control of the program to Lockheed Martin. The contractor is delivering the aircraft the Pentagon paid to design and build, but under the contract, Lockheed and its suppliers retained control of design and repair data \u2013 the proprietary information needed to fix and upgrade the plane.\n\n>Bill Whitaker: So you spend billions and billions of dollars to get this plane built. And it doesn't actually belong to the Department of Defense?\n\n>Chris Bogdan: The weapon system belongs to the department. But the data underlying the design of the airplane does not.\n\n>Bill Whitaker: We can't maintain and sustain the planes without Lockheed's--\n\n>Chris Bogdan: Correct. And that's because-- that's because we didn't-- we didn't up front either buy or negotiate getting the-- the technical data we needed so that when a part breaks, the DOD can fix it themselves.\n\nI could go on and on. Just because Pierre Sprey once had idiots bad mouth the F-35 does not mean the F-35 did not have and continues to have very very real problems.\n\n>All aircraft suffer from accidents at some point, but from my understanding the F-35 is very safe, especially when compared to other aircraft models in US inventory like the F-16.\n\nThe safety record of the F-35 is in line with most other fighters today. You really can't compare the F-35 to the early years of fighters that flew in eras where the safety culture isn't anything close to what it is today. For instance, the early F-16s had a lot of crashes, and we lost multiple F-14s in development. But by the 80s, the legacy Hornet never lost a fighter in test/development. Today? It's extremely rare for any plane to be lost in development, even for a fighter\n\nedit: fixed link above",
