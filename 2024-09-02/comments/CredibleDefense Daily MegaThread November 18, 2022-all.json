Anyway they are already going to deactivate one squadron because of a shortage with airframes. </p>\n\n<p>Other countries could buy F-35s and then deliver them to Ukraine when the F-35s arrive, but that would be years from now. There are something like half a dozen air forces waiting on F-35s right now with more buying. If LockMart could make more airframes they would be, there is a serious bottleneck there.</p>\n</div>",

It seems to be conflating two  opinions in an effort to use the credentials of the first opinion to bolster the second. Milley has been vocal about Ukraine needing to seek a settlement, but, as far as I recall, he didn\u2019t characterize Ukrainian offensives as \u201cslow, crude, and ineffective\u201d. That assessment instead must have come from the unnamed \u201csceptics\u201d who are being associated with Milley to lend credibility to their opinion while distorting what Milley said.\n\nMuch is unknown about Ukrainian military performance. Given the pace of the war, Ukraine clearly has challenges. At the same time, it appears that the Kherson offensive was far better executed than anything we\u2019ve seen from Russia.",

It seems to be conflating two  opinions in an effort to use the credentials of the first opinion to bolster the second. Milley has been vocal about Ukraine needing to seek a settlement, but, as far as I recall, he didn\u2019t characterize Ukrainian offensives as \u201cslow, crude, and ineffective\u201d. That assessment instead must have come from the unnamed \u201csceptics\u201d who are being associated with Milley to lend credibility to their opinion while distorting what Milley said.</p>\n\n<p>Much is unknown about Ukrainian military performance. Given the pace of the war, Ukraine clearly has challenges. At the same time, it appears that the Kherson offensive was far better executed than anything we\u2019ve seen from Russia.</p>\n</div>",

                    "body": "Well the weapon that comes to mind there is the AK-47, which was exported *massively* because everybody wanted it, because it was such a good gun. There is a reason why every two bit insurgent and army in the world rocks AKs and not M-16s/M4s. Cheap, brutally simple, takes a pounding.\n\nBut you also should keep in mind that arms sales are inherently political. Its not just about whose weapon is better, its about whose security orbit you want to be in, whose arms agents are more influential. For example in Iran, the Shah received a whole host of American aid up until 1979. There was some, very limited, talk of arming Iran after the Shah, but by Reagan's admin it was obvious that the only deal which could be done was limited, covert, and *highly* controversial. Iran pulled itself out of the US military orbit and has now drifted on its own course vaguely towards Russia and China. The F-14 and Phoenix was just *better* than anything else Iran wanted, but there politics played a big role. You even see this in Australia, regardless of the technical details buying a modern US sub ensures that theyll be in the American naval orbit for decades. Buying a French sub changes the politics there.\n\nRegardless, the F-16 is another platform that gets passed around a lot but is rarely used outside of Israel, and even they they modify the fuck out of their planes. F-15 was exported a bit, but not really used. Russian Foxtrot, November, and Kilo subs as well as the German Dolphin type sub were exported but not used (tbf, most naval equipment is exported then never used naval battles are exceedingly rare these days).\n\nAnd a few more examples, the T-72 Ural was bad in the 1980s when Saddam got them, he did poorly with them, and even the A and early B models these days are pretty much a joke. But the Soviets/Russians exported them all over the world, most third world palace guards Id guess use some kind of T-72. MiG-21s were exported likewise, and were good... when they were built. By Desert Storm the MiG-21 was obsolete and since then.... yikes. But a country buying MiG-21s and -23s these days isn't doing it because they feel theyre superior to the F-16/F-35s of the world. They do them because the cant afford or dont have access to modern equipment.\n\n*edit*: Sorry one more example, the Leopard 2! Its been exported all over Europe, and I would argue for reasons of politics and economics more than proven capabilities tho on paper it should be a good tank. IIRC its only combat experience has been with Turkey in Syria and there the Leos by all reports have done quite poorly. Now there are reasons for this, apparently the Turks struggled at first with infantry/armor coordination. BUT! if youre just going by export level vs. battlefield experience, I cant think of many better examples of that mismatch than the Leo2.",
                    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Well the weapon that comes to mind there is the AK-47, which was exported <em>massively</em> because everybody wanted it, because it was such a good gun. There is a reason why every two bit insurgent and army in the world rocks AKs and not M-16s/M4s. Cheap, brutally simple, takes a pounding.</p>\n\n<p>But you also should keep in mind that arms sales are inherently political.

For example I think World of Tanks only modeled the 75mm (the 37 was intended to be its primary AT armament) while Warthunder models the 37 as the primary armament, while the 75mm (your actually primary AT) is very hard to aim and fire. IRL the ergonomics were better, tho not great. It had good armor, and the 75mm was a decent if low velocity gun. It compared well with the ubiquitous Zis-5, having lower muzzle velocity but higher penetration. Plus it came with a very nice HE round. The issue was the hull placement, because it was so low, and in a casemate, the tank had to uncover most of its profile to fire. It was hard to fire on the move. And it struggled against turreted tanks for responsiveness. The 37mm gun was thought to be the primary antitank gun, but it was not up to the job as indeed most German 37mms proved to be. It could kill light vehicles and the Pz. II series, but Pz. III and IV were much better protected. Moreover, the Pz. IV quickly gained the long 75mm, as of 1941, and so could kill an M3 Lee at ranges exceeding the effective engagement envelope of the 37mm. Meaning the M3 would have to unmask its hull against potentially a hull down Pz IV. \n\nAlso worth noting tho that very few games get combined arms right, and the M3 was a *great* infantry support tank. With several MGs, a fast firing 37mm, and the heavy 75mm gun, it could bring a lot of fire to bear. It played well with infantry. It also had more crew members, making it easier to maintain day to day than the crew-strapped T-34 (which otherwise suffered severe reliability problems in 1941 and 42). And when compared against the M2 monstrosity, and what the British were at that time driving, it compares favorably. But the M4 was much better, a more coherent design, and there is a reason why that was favored as the main American battle tank over the M3.",

And remember, Ukraine was already the poorest country in Europe per capita. </p>\n\n<p>Russia will suffer from prolonged war, but the fighting itself is taking place exclusively in Ukraine. In case of a ceasefire Russia will get time to reorganized and replenish their supplies, while Ukraine will still be in a situation where their country is left in ruin, without a chance to fix it up. The refugees will not return before the war is over, Ukraine will not get back any of their eastern industrial regions by accepting ceasefire, there will be no foreign investment in Ukraine before the war is over. How much of use will they get from their shiny new Western trained units when their country falls apart?</p>\n</div>",

There they dont have enough airframe for active squadrons, let alone enough to trade to Ukraine. The US *Could* just buy and gift out F-35s, but then production on them is legit limited while the three air forces all wrestle to complete their transition, plus the already signed deals. Even without Ukraine, if LockMart could make more F-35s I bet they would be. And of course there are still security issues with the airplane too, it was a big deal when the Brits lost theirs. \n\nWere talking here about air fleets that have been built up for a generation since the end of the Cold War, air forces are not like Armies and cant just be raised overnight. 300k reservists does an air force basically no good, the bottleneck are frames and pilots.",
