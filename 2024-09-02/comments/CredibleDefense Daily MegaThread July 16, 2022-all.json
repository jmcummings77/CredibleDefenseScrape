The imperative to expand influence and establish a military presence in one of the key water bodies drives their efforts, the Red Sea remains an important cog in the wheel of the Belt and Road Initiative by China.\n\nIf Sudan is a no go for Russia, the obvious next step is Eritrea and it's 600-mile coastline along the Red Sea, Russia and Eritrea have in the past shown big interest in deepening economic cooperation. Eritrea has consistently adhered to pro-Russia positions on a wide range of issues, despite lacking notable security ties with Moscow. In 2014, Eritrea was the first country to send its foreign minister to Crimea after Russia annexed the peninsula. Recently, Putin chose to ignore Afwerki\u2019s offer for a base in the port of Assab following the departure of UAE's forces in April 2021, if Sudan is a no-go, it'll almost certainly be Eritrea.\n\nThe presence of the US, China, and Russia as well as regional players like Iran and the UAE in the Red Sea points towards the evolving reality of intensifying great power politics.",

They continue to try and delay and do delay tactics,\u201d said a U.S. intelligence official. \u201cWe see it as unlikely that the Port Sudan deal is going to be done anytime in the near future and that Russia is potentially looking to seek other options if Port Sudan doesn\u2019t work out.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Interesting that Russia wants a foothold in the Red Sea, In the last few years, global and regional players have established their military bases in the littoral states of the Red Sea, China recently opened military base in Djibouti. The imperative to expand influence and establish a military presence in one of the key water bodies drives their efforts, the Red Sea remains an important cog in the wheel of the Belt and Road Initiative by China.</p>\n\n<p>If Sudan is a no go for Russia, the obvious next step is Eritrea and it&#39;s 600-mile coastline along the Red Sea, Russia and Eritrea have in the past shown big interest in deepening economic cooperation. Eritrea has consistently adhered to pro-Russia positions on a wide range of issues, despite lacking notable security ties with Moscow. In 2014, Eritrea was the first country to send its foreign minister to Crimea after Russia annexed the peninsula. Recently, Putin chose to ignore Afwerki\u2019s offer for a base in the port of Assab following the departure of UAE&#39;s forces in April 2021, if Sudan is a no-go, it&#39;ll almost certainly be Eritrea.</p>\n\n<p>The presence of the US, China, and Russia as well as regional players like Iran and the UAE in the Red Sea points towards the evolving reality of intensifying great power politics.</p>\n</div>",

After taken to hospital, he managed to escape from the hospital a few hours before the Russians captured it.  Initially, Patriots from Kherson hid him. This lasted two months. He later attempted to leave, heading for unoccupied territory; however, he ended up at an enemy checkpoint. The Russians inspected him and noticed wounds on his body; they then sent him to a torture chamber.</p>\n\n<p>The second hostage, the high-ranking police officer, did not have his name disclosed as his family remains in the occupied territory. He received offers from the invaders to defect to them.  He refused.  Consequently, he was kidnapped and tortured.</p>\n\n<p>Ukrainian special forces decided to eliminate the torture chambers established by the occupiers in their rear. In order to do this, Special Forces imperceivably crossed the front lines in the south, and then carried out a blitz-style operation. The area surrounding the house had a minefield, as well as tripwires for land mines. They overcame both\u2014our fighters liquidated the prison guards, rescued the prisoners, and quietly moved them to the territory controlled by Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>The military notes that the enemy was unprepared for such missions by the Ukrainians. Even when the shooting started, still unaware or frozen. After all, the invaders themselves repeatedly arranged shooting there, often simply for entertainment.</p>\n\n<p>How many occupiers were killed was not disclosed.  However, trophies, including documents of all the Russian military personnel who tortured Ukrainians in this prison.\u201d</p>\n</div>",

Partial mobilization would mean plenty of new fresh troops (to the point Russia would finally be finally at good odds with Ukraine's employed manpower) but with highly likely deficiency in armor support among other things. Regardless,  it could trigger the failure of multiple Ukraine's defenses which could result in a snowball effect but we're not talking about how prepared Russia's new troops would be, equipped, and led. It would make the logistics tougher for Russia.

Cities would be leveled. Casualties would rise enormously for both sides. A full mobilization is \"the gloves are off\" moment for Russia.\n\nBoth types of mobilization would cause extensive damage in every possible way to both countries and Russia has to juggle a lot. They need a good material for any major escalation. So far, nothing usable has shown up.

You in fact doubled down on \"Zelensky doesnt have authority to delegate.\" Only now does this answer occur to you, after I've already said it several times. Except for the \"authority is not absolute\" part that is wholly yours and still flat wrong. And it makes the entire argument incoherent. \n\nSo with your original comment in mind, I will ask you for the third time. Where do Ukrainian generals get the right to refuse orders from Zelensky regarding the time, place, and manner of offensives.\n    \n>Have I given the impression that the army is doing its own things without the input of the civilian population?\n\nYes, you are literally saying that. You are saying that the civilian leadership may not order action from their military beyond setting the most vague trendlines, and you also said \"See the protests against the invasion of Afghanistan in the early 2000s and how they where outright ignored by the military.\"",

Absolutely not</li>\n<li>he definitely has the authority to do so. but only when they have political impact</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>My point in my original comment is that zelenski is using a delegated authority for a majority of the Ukrainian military actions, whilst keeping the nuance that his authority is not absolute, he can replace delegates but if zelenski orders something that goes against military advice then his delegates have the right to refuse and resign.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is not what you meant, and I know that because i asked you specifically in a way that was open for just such a response, and you refused to give it. You in fact doubled down on &quot;Zelensky doesnt have authority to delegate.&quot; Only now does this answer occur to you, after I&#39;ve already said it several times. Except for the &quot;authority is not absolute&quot; part that is wholly yours and still flat wrong. And it makes the entire argument incoherent. </p>\n\n<p>So with your original comment in mind, I will ask you for the third time. Where do Ukrainian generals get the right to refuse orders from Zelensky regarding the time, place, and manner of offensives.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Have I given the impression that the army is doing its own things without the input of the civilian population?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes, you are literally saying that. You are saying that the civilian leadership may not order action from their military beyond setting the most vague trendlines, and you also said &quot;See the protests against the invasion of Afghanistan in the early 2000s and how they where outright ignored by the military.&quot;</p>\n</div>",

Russia will settle in to defend the territory it has gained. Ukraine will launch probing attacks to try to retake territory but any progress will be painfully slow and casualties will be heavy on both sides. Ukraine will keep gaining more western aid, doing more damage with long-range artillery, and slowly the balance of casualties will turn significnatly to Ukraine's favour and Russia starts running low on equipment and manpower.

Domestic and international pressure may grow towards finding some sort of agreement that might include Ukraine giving up some territory, or rather agree to some sort of ceasefire that de facto leaves Russia in control of Crimea and parts of the separatist regions, though Ukraine will not officially rescinding any territory.

            "body": "The US isn't necessarily more reluctant to export the F-15/F-15E, at least not today. It's simply more expensive than the F-16. Not just upfront costs but total cost of ownership. The F-15 is a purpose built air superiority fighter, it had very little little strike ability until the F-15E Strike Eagle variant. The F-16 was submitted as daytime air superiority fighter but was given strike abilities from the get go. Modern F-16s may have less payload than the F-15E, but they still can carry a wider selection of armaments then the F-15E, including the AGM-88 HARM. \n\nHistorically the F-15 was a no comprise, cost is not a issue, air superiority aircraft designed to combat the MiG-25. The US believed the MiG-25 was a agile high speed air superiority fighter, but it was the last the pure jet interceptor made. In reality the MiG-25 has poor maneuverability and abysmal range, but it is one of the fastest aircraft ever made. Capable of sustaining speeds of mach 2.5, and capable of going just as fast as the SR-71 if you don't mind destroying the massive turbojets in short order. The MiG-25 was designed to intercept bombers, specifically the never put into production XB-70, using the massive 1,000 lbs long range beyond visual range air to air R-40. \n\nThe F-16 was designed as a low cost option to complement the F-15, born out of the [Lightweight Fighter Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Fighter_program) designed as a highly agile multipurpose fighter aircraft capable of air superiority. \n\nI'm not sure where this notion of Ukraine getting the F-15 came from. The F-16 is cheaper, more versatile, and has much better availability. Everybody and their mother has owned a F-16 as it is a excellent platform. The F-15E is a excellent platform as well, but again, no AGM-88. \n\nEdit: Just to add cause of the other comment. The F-15 doesn't have better air to air capabilities in reality. Modern blocks of either have excellent radars and both have the AIM-120. Dogfighting doesn't mean anything when a BVR missile pops you from 70 miles away.",

Modern F-16s may have less payload than the F-15E, but they still can carry a wider selection of armaments then the F-15E, including the AGM-88 HARM. </p>\n\n<p>Historically the F-15 was a no comprise, cost is not a issue, air superiority aircraft designed to combat the MiG-25. The US believed the MiG-25 was a agile high speed air superiority fighter, but it was the last the pure jet interceptor made. In reality the MiG-25 has poor maneuverability and abysmal range, but it is one of the fastest aircraft ever made. Capable of sustaining speeds of mach 2.5, and capable of going just as fast as the SR-71 if you don&#39;t mind destroying the massive turbojets in short order. The MiG-25 was designed to intercept bombers, specifically the never put into production XB-70, using the massive 1,000 lbs long range beyond visual range air to air R-40. </p>\n\n<p>The F-16 was designed as a low cost option to complement the F-15, born out of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Fighter_program\">Lightweight Fighter Program</a> designed as a highly agile multipurpose fighter aircraft capable of air superiority. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not sure where this notion of Ukraine getting the F-15 came from. The F-16 is cheaper, more versatile, and has much better availability. Everybody and their mother has owned a F-16 as it is a excellent platform. The F-15E is a excellent platform as well, but again, no AGM-88. </p>\n\n<p>Edit: Just to add cause of the other comment. The F-15 doesn&#39;t have better air to air capabilities in reality. Modern blocks of either have excellent radars and both have the AIM-120. Dogfighting doesn&#39;t mean anything when a BVR missile pops you from 70 miles away.</p>\n</div>",
