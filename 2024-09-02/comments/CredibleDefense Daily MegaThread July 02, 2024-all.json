Edit Zgut-Przybylska is very diplomatic in her assessment: the Hungarian government has painted itself into a corner where it has practically no leeway to pursue its own policy here. As a landlocked country with hardly any domestic energy resources and an economy that's been rendered very brittle by a decade of interventionist policy, its sovereignty over its foreign policy towards Ukraine ends about where the Kremlin says it ends.\n\nHowever, there are some interesting nuances that aren't present in the New York Times' summary. Orban is trying to sell Putin's, erm, I mean, *Hungary*'s ceasefire in [slightly altered terms](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/hungary-pm-orban-arrives-kyiv-talks-with-ukraines-zelenskiy-2024-07-02/):\n\n> \"I asked the president to think about whether we could reverse the order, and speed up peace talks with making a ceasefire first,\" Orban said.\n>\n> \"*A ceasefire connected to a deadline* (emphasis mine) would give a chance to speed up peace talks. I explored this possibility with the president and I am grateful for his honest answers and negotiation.\"\n\nAnd it seems like he didn't really [press the issue too much](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2024/07/2/7463677/):\n\n> However, Viktor Orb\u00e1n stated that he did not insist on his initiative and accepted Ukraine\u2019s reasons.\n>\n> \"I am very grateful to the president for his frank opinion on this issue,\" he said, promising to convey what he heard to other state leaders of the European Union.\n\nIt seems like some effort has been made to make this look like a genuine offer at mediation in the interest of peace, rather than in pursuance of Russia's objectives. I don't think I've seen the deadline talking point being made in Russian circles before, so this spin might genuinely come from Budapest, rather than Moscow.\n\nThe most favourable way to look at it is that Orban is trying not to alienate his European partners in a way that would still meet Moscow's approval. If Hungary is going to use the influence of its six-month presidency to help Russia pursue its objectives through diplomatic pressure by relay, it might be dragging its feet a little. Whether they're dragging their feet until the end of their presidency or just until they can build up more support (e.g. after elections in France) is anyone's guess.\n\nPersonally, I think it's just a belated attempt at legitimizing the Hungarian presidency and at re-establishing some positive influence on the foreign scene for Hungary. The Hungarian government has been playing the strong-arming veto game that they've been largely unable to pursue any policy at the EU level for years now. They've managed to block initiatives but have all but lost constructive ability, and all they've been able to get has been squeezed out through concessions, which are good bonuses but not a very solid base to build on. Without the ability to exert some positive influence, their presidency is practically useless, being able to set the agenda has very little practical value when no one else is willing to work on it with you.\n\nSo Orban is now trying to look like he's taking active mediation steps, and that his country is trying to pursue a position that reconciles their interests with those of the EU. It might actually be worth playing along with. It's a very bad deceit. But on the one hand, the time to call it out was before Hungary assumed presidency. And on the other hand, I am willing to offer EU and Hungarian leaders some benefit of the doubt here and think that, if Hungary is actually trying to discretely extricate itself from its current status of quasi-vassal state, a discrete understanding that Hungary will put up a show of support for Russia while not actually pushing for it in any meaningful way in exchange for not even bringing up the topic of suspending their voting rights might be a good way to go about it.",

The panels that eventually decided who was a Nazi and who wasn't had a wide (typically 3:1) SPU-aligned majority, usually vetted by the NKVD if not outright collaborators of the NKVD, so they \"denazified\" everyone except Russian-vetted politicians, public servants and military officers, regardless of whether they'd been actual Nazi collaborators or not.\n\nHow exactly do you imagine Putin's vision, whatever that is, would work?

A democratically-elected Ukrainian government?

It was ordered by the Politburo of the Communist Party against so-called \"Polish spies\" and customarily interpreted by NKVD officials as relating to 'absolutely all Poles'.[citation needed] It resulted in the sentencing of 139,835 people, and **summary executions of 111,091 Poles** living in or near the Soviet Union.[4][5] The operation was implemented according to NKVD Order No. 00485 signed by Nikolai Yezhov.[6]\n> \n> The majority of the shooting victims were ethnically Polish,[1] but not all, with some belonging to various minority groups from the Kresy macro-region, for instance, Ruthenians; these groups in the Soviet worldview had some element of Polish culture or heritage, and were therefore also \"Polish\".[7] **The NKVD agents looked through local phone books to expedite the procedure and detained people with names that sounded Polish.[8]**\n> \n> While similar to other operations such as the Greek Operation, Finnish Operation, Latvian Operation and Estonian Operation, the Polish Operation was the largest ethnic shooting and deportation action during the Great Purge campaign of political murders in the Soviet Union.[9][10] According to official data, victims of the Polish Operation accounted for 41.7% of the sentenced people and 44.9% of the executed people during all such ethnic operations.[11]\n\n> ....\n> \n> According to archives of the NKVD, 111,091 Poles and people accused of ties with Poland, were sentenced to death, and 28,744 were sentenced to labor camps; 139,835 victims in total.[19] This number constitutes 10% of the total number of people officially convicted during the Yezhovshchina period, based on confirming NKVD documents.[20]\n> \n> **According to historian Bogdan Musia\u0142: \"It is estimated that Polish losses in the Ukrainian SSR were about 30%, while in the Belorussian SSR... the Polish minority was almost completely annihilated or deported.\"** Musia\u0142 is also of the opinion that \"it does not seem unlikely, as Soviet statistics indicate, that the number of Poles dropped from 792,000 in 1926 to 627,000 in 1939.\"[17]\n> \n> Almost all victims of the NKVD shootings were men, wrote Micha\u0142 Jasi\u0144ski, most with families.

Orphaned children without relatives willing to take them were put in orphanages to be brought up as Soviet, with no knowledge of their origins. All possessions of the accused were confiscated. The parents of the executed men \u2013 as well as their in-laws \u2013 were left with nothing to live on, which usually sealed their fate as well.

Orban, based on his past actions and statements, will likely agree with this plan. If he could also be a central player in implementing it, garnering him international prestige and influence for his isolated regime, he'd consider it a double victory.

The report covers, in detail, the technical aspects of what a restart would entail but I'm more interested in motive. Broadly, as I understand it, there are three main reasons why Russia would want an operational NPP on the front lines in Ukraine. First, to supply electricity to occupied Ukraine. Second, to add weight to their annexation of the territory. Third, to impede Ukrainian Armed Forces operations in the region. The first two motives work in tandem, if you annex a territory you need to govern it and by providing civil services such as electricity you add weight to the claim. In addition, restarting the plant requires it be disconnected from the Ukrainian power grid and connected to the grid in the occupied territories, further sharpening the line between the land that Russia has taken and the rest of Ukraine. Finally, an operational NPP creates enormous risks for Ukrainian operations in the region. Not only does it shield the direct area via threat of nuclear catastrophe but damage to the electrical grid supported by the ZNPP would also carry risk because NPPs rely on a stable external electrical supply during emergency operations. \n\nI'm interested in other motives that people can generate for this move by the Russians.",

This argument that China will feel the need to go now when they\u2019ve really given no indication that they will and when their strategic position in the Pacific will only strengthen is completely unconvincing.\n\nThe US doesn\u2019t actually have that much microchip manufacturing capability. That\u2019s Taiwan and South Korea.

This is a result of a number of factors, most notably frustration with the failure by political leadership to articulate a viable exit strategy.\n\n> Israel\u2019s top generals want to begin a cease-fire in Gaza even if it keeps Hamas in power for the time being, widening a rift between the military and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has opposed a truce that would allow Hamas to survive the war. The generals think that a truce would be the best way of freeing the roughly 120 Israelis still held, both dead and alive, in Gaza, according to interviews with six current and former security officials.\n\n> Underequipped for further fighting after Israel\u2019s longest war in decades, the generals also think their forces need time to recuperate in case a land war breaks out against Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia that has been locked in a low-level fight with Israel since October, multiple officials said. A truce with Hamas could also make it easier to reach a deal with Hezbollah, according to the officials, most of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive security matters. Hezbollah has said it will continue to strike northern Israel until Israel stops fighting in the Gaza Strip.\n\n> The military\u2019s attitude to a cease-fire reflects a major shift in its thinking over the past months as it became more clear that Mr. Netanyahu was refusing to articulate or commit to a postwar plan. That decision has essentially created a power vacuum in the enclave that has forced the military to go back and fight in parts of Gaza it had already cleared of Hamas fighters.\n\n> \"The military is in full support of a hostage deal and a cease-fire,\u201d said Eyal Hulata, who served as Israel\u2019s national security adviser until early last year, and who speaks regularly with senior military officials. \n\n> \u201cThey believe that they can always go back and engage Hamas militarily in the future,\u201d Mr. Hulata said. \u201cThey understand that a pause in Gaza makes de-escalation more likely in Lebanon. And they have less munitions, less spare parts, less energy than they did before \u2014 so they also think a pause in Gaza gives us more time to prepare in case a bigger war does break out with Hezbollah.\u201d\n\nThey are also concerned about exhausting human and material resources in the context of another potential conflict with Hezbollah.\n\n> Nearly nine months into a war that Israel did not plan for, its army is short of spare parts, munitions, motivation and even troops, the officials said.\nThe war is the most intense conflict that Israel has fought in at least four decades, and the longest it has ever fought in Gaza. In an army largely reliant on reservists, some are on their third tour of duty since October and struggling to balance the fighting with their professional and family commitments.\nFewer reservists are reporting for duty, according to four military officials. And officers are increasingly distrustful of their commanders, amid a crisis of confidence in the military leadership propelled in part by its failure to prevent the Hamas-led attack in October, according to five officers.\n\n> At least some tanks in Gaza are not loaded with the full capacity of the shells that they usually carry, as the military tries to conserve its stocks in case a bigger war with Hezbollah does break out, according to two officers. Five officials and officers confirmed that the army was running low on shells. The army also lacks spare parts for its tanks, military bulldozers and armored vehicles, according to several of those officials.\n\nOf course it remains to be seen what course of action the Israeli government will opt for, but this obviously adds to the pressure for a ceasefire in Gaza, no matter how politically toxic that may be.",

Foremost, European countries would need to take the lead in their own backyard, from troop deployments to funding. \n\n* [A two-tiered system would be implemented](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-adviser-proposes-new-tiered-system-nato-members-who-dont-pay-up-2024-02-13/), where nations contributing <2% of their GDP to defense essentially wouldn't be guaranteed under Article 5 as it's currently understood. A5's wording is fairly vague, and Trump would use this to throw \"freeloaders\" under the bus.
