That would mean that between 462,000 and 728,000 Russian soldiers were out of action by mid-June\u2014more than Russia\u2019s estimated invading force in February 2022. (French and British officials estimate that around 500,000 Russians had been severely injured or killed by May.)\n\n\nThen the kyiv independent misread this and now we have 'a leaked US document saying there's between 462,000 and 728,000 KIA/WIA' The Mediazona numbers are still good, and the KIA/WIA ratio if it's held DOES reflect this, but there is no actual US documents saying it.\n\nOne fascinating thing is that the Russian Army seems to be losing troops as fast as it's recruiting- US sources HAVE been quoted by the New York Times as saying Russia recruits at 25-30k a month, while they are losing ~1000+ a day per Mediazona. The new contractors are signed, 'trained' and in a 'meat assault' in a very short time, and I really can't understand why they do this instead of forming big reserve units that they could then dump on a new front line. They're defeating themselves in detail, which is pretty much the story of this war. The explanation I figure is that the C2 and officer corps just can't handle setting up new training and units. That sort of reality is what prevents you from doing shit like launching 1000 Shaheds at once.",

(French and British officials estimate that around 500,000 Russians had been severely injured or killed by May.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Then the kyiv independent misread this and now we have &#39;a leaked US document saying there&#39;s between 462,000 and 728,000 KIA/WIA&#39; The Mediazona numbers are still good, and the KIA/WIA ratio if it&#39;s held DOES reflect this, but there is no actual US documents saying it.</p>\n\n<p>One fascinating thing is that the Russian Army seems to be losing troops as fast as it&#39;s recruiting- US sources HAVE been quoted by the New York Times as saying Russia recruits at 25-30k a month, while they are losing ~1000+ a day per Mediazona. The new contractors are signed, &#39;trained&#39; and in a &#39;meat assault&#39; in a very short time, and I really can&#39;t understand why they do this instead of forming big reserve units that they could then dump on a new front line. They&#39;re defeating themselves in detail, which is pretty much the story of this war. The explanation I figure is that the C2 and officer corps just can&#39;t handle setting up new training and units. That sort of reality is what prevents you from doing shit like launching 1000 Shaheds at once.</p>\n</div>",

                    "body": "For one, contractors are supposed to bid via proposals, and so the other half is that contractors want to be most competitive. So they have every incentive to look like the cheapest but best option overall (so while it is untrue that you must go with the lowest bidder, you must score each proposal on its own merits, and if cost is a major factor - which it almost always is - the cheaper bidder may have the best proposal) because they want to win said contracts. So a program office's estimates may or may not matter, because you have to look at each contract on its own. \n\nAlso, keep in mind that in some scenarios - such as ones where there is only one viable contractor (e.g., to make a CVN) - you may be working WITH the contractor to figure out estimated costs before you make your annual budget request to get authorization and the $$$ to start said program. Starting to see some issues where the wolves could be indirectly in charge of the hen's house? \n\nCompetition is so so important. You can damn near draw a direct line between the post-Cold War consolidation of the defense industry and the widespread growth in programs that have cost and/or schedule overruns. \n\n(And in some crazy areas, like the RCOH process for our CVNs, we've seen cost and schedules explode despite the same people having done this for decades now where the process should be getting easier and more straightforward with experience, not harder/slower, but I digress)\n\nAlso, if you overestimate you:\n\n1) Risk getting your program axed before it is even started because your department \n\n2) Risk not getting funds because Congress and the taxpayers would balk at it\n\n3) Still creates zero incentives for the contractor, especially with cost-plus contracts where they get all that money anyways, no matter the true cost, and fixed-cost can give them wildly absurd profit margins that would cause #2 to happen even more.\n\n4) Goes against various regulations and the basic principles of being a good steward of funds. \n\nKeep in mind that the DOD budgeting process is from the ground up - each department takes inputs its from its various components. If you end up asking for way more share of the pie than your leadership wants you to get, they start to wonder if you are really as important as your requested $$ says you are - and if they don't like that answer, or they may be under the gun on their own overall share of the bigger budget, they may delay or push your program start back until better financial times. \n\nSo for instance, if you are the office in charge of aircraft carriers, and you estimate the first ship in the Ford class will cost $30 billion dollars - or nearly 1/7th of the annual DoN budget - they'd laugh in your face and tell you to change your requirements/scope of your program, think you are incompetent, or if there was no pressing need for your particular system, look at alternatives (to include continuing construction of the Nimitz class).\n\nSo to justify your program's new or continued existence, you want to make yourself look at as competitive as possible within that finite pie.\n\nCynically, the trick is that once you get going, it's a lot easier for people to keep your machine alive than it is to kill it. Especially if your program creates a lot of jobs in Congressman Joe's district. \n\n(This ground up process, by the way, is the biggest reason for why \"use or lose\" budgeting is a thing. If your command doesn't use your money, it's a lot harder to justify getting that same level - or higher - amount of funding next year. It's not that you won't get that funding next year - nor is it automatic that you will get it if you spend it. It's that it's really hard to justify getting that funding if you never use it, because your leadership could shrink your part of the pie to send somewhere else)",

So they have every incentive to look like the cheapest but best option overall (so while it is untrue that you must go with the lowest bidder, you must score each proposal on its own merits, and if cost is a major factor - which it almost always is - the cheaper bidder may have the best proposal) because they want to win said contracts. So a program office&#39;s estimates may or may not matter, because you have to look at each contract on its own. </p>\n\n<p>Also, keep in mind that in some scenarios - such as ones where there is only one viable contractor (e.g., to make a CVN) - you may be working WITH the contractor to figure out estimated costs before you make your annual budget request to get authorization and the $$$ to start said program. Starting to see some issues where the wolves could be indirectly in charge of the hen&#39;s house? </p>\n\n<p>Competition is so so important. You can damn near draw a direct line between the post-Cold War consolidation of the defense industry and the widespread growth in programs that have cost and/or schedule overruns. </p>\n\n<p>(And in some crazy areas, like the RCOH process for our CVNs, we&#39;ve seen cost and schedules explode despite the same people having done this for decades now where the process should be getting easier and more straightforward with experience, not harder/slower, but I digress)</p>\n\n<p>Also, if you overestimate you:</p>\n\n<p>1) Risk getting your program axed before it is even started because your department </p>\n\n<p>2) Risk not getting funds because Congress and the taxpayers would balk at it</p>\n\n<p>3) Still creates zero incentives for the contractor, especially with cost-plus contracts where they get all that money anyways, no matter the true cost, and fixed-cost can give them wildly absurd profit margins that would cause #2 to happen even more.</p>\n\n<p>4) Goes against various regulations and the basic principles of being a good steward of funds. </p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that the DOD budgeting process is from the ground up - each department takes inputs its from its various components. If you end up asking for way more share of the pie than your leadership wants you to get, they start to wonder if you are really as important as your requested $$ says you are - and if they don&#39;t like that answer, or they may be under the gun on their own overall share of the bigger budget, they may delay or push your program start back until better financial times. </p>\n\n<p>So for instance, if you are the office in charge of aircraft carriers, and you estimate the first ship in the Ford class will cost $30 billion dollars - or nearly 1/7th of the annual DoN budget - they&#39;d laugh in your face and tell you to change your requirements/scope of your program, think you are incompetent, or if there was no pressing need for your particular system, look at alternatives (to include continuing construction of the Nimitz class).</p>\n\n<p>So to justify your program&#39;s new or continued existence, you want to make yourself look at as competitive as possible within that finite pie.</p>\n\n<p>Cynically, the trick is that once you get going, it&#39;s a lot easier for people to keep your machine alive than it is to kill it. Especially if your program creates a lot of jobs in Congressman Joe&#39;s district. </p>\n\n<p>(This ground up process, by the way, is the biggest reason for why &quot;use or lose&quot; budgeting is a thing. If your command doesn&#39;t use your money, it&#39;s a lot harder to justify getting that same level - or higher - amount of funding next year. It&#39;s not that you won&#39;t get that funding next year - nor is it automatic that you will get it if you spend it. It&#39;s that it&#39;s really hard to justify getting that funding if you never use it, because your leadership could shrink your part of the pie to send somewhere else)</p>\n</div>",

Government program management has plenty of its own issues, but at the end of the day, a lot of this (edit: not Sentinel specifically, but the general trend of delays and cost overruns) also comes down to contractor performance and simply not delivering the good promised - contributing to our overall broken system. You have to look at each programs issues on its own merits, and you'll find that there is plenty of blame to go around, and contractor performance is often a big part of it. It's not black and white - nothing is.\n\nFor one, with a lot of traditional cost-plus contracts, there isn't much incentive to deliver things faster or under cost - they're getting paid either way, and they can always run to mommy and daddy (Congress) which can keep programs alive well past their drop dead date.\n\nEven with incentivized cost-plus contracts, there are numerous games contractors play. Turns out, they can always hire a better legal team than we can.\n\nThe lack of [competition in the DOD industrial base](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/2937898/dod-report-consolidation-of-defense-industrial-base-poses-risks-to-national-sec/) has been listed as one fo the top defense issues - and is [a particularly sobering read](https://media.defense.gov/2022/Feb/15/2002939087/-1/-1/1/STATE-OF-COMPETITION-WITHIN-THE-DEFENSE-INDUSTRIAL-BASE.PDF)\n\n>\"Since the 1990s, the defense sector has consolidated substantially, transitioning from 51 to 5 aerospace and defense prime contractors,\" the report states. \"As a result, DOD is increasingly reliant on a small number of contractors for critical defense capabilities.\"  \n\n>Over the last 30 years, the report continues, the number of suppliers for things such as tactical missiles, fixed-wing aircraft, and satellites have all declined dramatically. For instance, 90% of missiles now come from just three sources, the report says.  \n\nAgain, what incentive is there when we issue only one contract for a system - say a missile - and with only three sources, each with their own niche, there are few-to-no market pressures for them to perform. And given that it takes years to budget (look up the PPBE, POM, and FYDP process... then come back crying) - and that Congress can't pass a budget on time - and it's the perfect system for contractors to not perform and things to never be delivered on time.\n\nAnd if you think leaving it up to the good graces' of the contractors is a good idea, let's read about how the government handed the keys to the kingdom to the F-35:\n\nThis [article from a couple months ago](https://insidedefense.com/daily-news/lessons-learned-f-35-air-force-will-now-purchase-ip-rights-its-weapon-systems) really goes into details on this stuff:\n\n>When the Air Force began buying the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter about 20 years ago, it took a total system approach, meaning prime contractor Lockheed Martin earned the rights to total control of the program, including the intellectual property of its technologies and mechanical parts. \n\n>The military, on the other hand, gave up the ability to put its own manpower behind sustainment or to solicit other vendors for support. \n\nHere's the sitting Secretary of the Air Force [blasting this openly](https://defensescoop.com/2023/05/22/kendall-vows-air-force-ngad-program-wont-repeat-serious-mistake-associated-with-the-f-35/):\n\n>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to repeat the \u2014 what I think, quite frankly, was a serious mistake that was made in the F-35 program of doing something which \u2026 came from an era which we had something called \u2018total system performance.\u2019 And the theory then was when a contractor won a program, they owned the program [and] it was going to do the whole lifecycle of the program \u2026 What that basically does is create a perpetual monopoly. And I spent years struggling to overcome acquisition malpractice, and we\u2019re still struggling with that to some degree,\u201d Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall told reporters during a Defense Writers Group meeting.\n\nPretty bold openly calling this acquisition malpractice against the current supplier of the F-35.\n\nAnd the former leader of the Joint Program Office, retired Lt. Gen Bogdan, [gave this interview](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pentagon-budget-price-gouging-military-contractors-60-minutes-2023-05-21/) to 60 Minutes:\n\n>The Pentagon had ceded control of the program to Lockheed Martin. The contractor is delivering the aircraft the Pentagon paid to design and build, but under the contract, Lockheed and its suppliers retained control of the design and repair data, the proprietary information needed to fix and upgrade the plane\n\n>\"The weapon system belongs to the department, but the data underlying the design of the airplane does not,\" Bogdan said.\n\nThere's lots of juicy ass quotes in there:\n\n>Perhaps no one understands the problem better than Shay Assad, now retired after four decades negotiating weapons deals. In the 1990s, he was executive vice president and chief contract negotiator for defense giant Raytheon. Then he switched sides and rose to become the Defense Department's most senior and awarded contract negotiator. He put his former colleagues in the defense industry under intense scrutiny.\n\n>\"They need to be held accountable,\" he said. \"No matter who they are, no matter what company it is, they need to be held accountable. And right now that accountability system is broken in the Department of Defense.\"\n\n>It wasn't always like this, he said. The roots of the problem can be traced to 1993, when the Pentagon, looking to reduce costs, urged defense companies to merge and 51 major contractors consolidated to five giants.\n\n>\"The landscape has totally changed,\" Assad said. \"In the '80s, there was intense competition amongst a number of companies. And so the government had choices. They had leverage. We have limited leverage now.\"\n\n>The problem was compounded in the early 2000s when the Pentagon, in another cost-saving move, cut 130,000 employees whose jobs were to negotiate and oversee defense contracts.  \n\n>\"They were convinced that they could rely on the companies to do what was in the best interests of the war fighters and the taxpayers,\" Assad said. \n\n>The Pentagon granted companies unprecedented leeway to monitor themselves. Instead of saving money, Assad said the price of almost everything began to rise. \n\n>In the competitive environment before the companies consolidated, a shoulder-fired stinger missile cost $25,000 in 1991. With Raytheon, Assad's former employer, now the sole supplier, it costs more than $400,000 to replace each missile sent to Ukraine. Even accounting for inflation and some improvements, that's a seven-fold increase.\n\n>\"For many of these weapons that are being sent over to Ukraine right now, there's only one supplier. And the companies know it,\" Assad said. \n\n>Army negotiators also caught Raytheon making what they called \"unacceptable profits\" from the Patriot missile defense system by dramatically exaggerating the cost and hours it took to build the radar and ground equipment.\n\n>The company told 60 Minutes it's working to \"equitably resolve\" the matter. In 2021, CEO Gregory Hayes informed investors that the company would set aside $290 million for probable liability.\n\nYou're not wrong that acquisition fuckups are systemic issues. But you're over-ascribing this to the government. We have only a handful of primary contractors, and the consolidated industrial base with no competition has been absolutely resulted in contractors taking advantage of the fact that there is no way to hold them accountable (whether by lack of competition or Congress stepping in), so they can repeatedly overpromise and underdeliver.\n\nDoes the government make bad acquisitions decisions? Yes. Does the government change requirements after the fact? Also yes. Does the contractor also often over promise and under deliver? Yes. Does the system also disincentivize competition and accountability? Heck yes!",

Sure, read on:\n\nFor one, Wikipedia doesn't give you a good gauge for WHAT airspeed is being measured. They say max speed for the P-51 is 440 mph with a cruise speed of 362 mph. \n\nThey appear to have taken these numbers [from this source](http://www.wwiiaircraftperformance.org/mustang/p-51-tactical-chart.jpg) which states that at normal combat weight (~9000 lbs), you could hit 440 mph at war emergency power at 30,000 feet.\n\nNow, notice how the top speed is lower as you get lower in altitude for the same power. Notice how rate of climb drops as you go higher in altitude.\n\nPropeller planes lose power as they get higher in altitude - so rate of climb decreasing as you climb is valid. But why is speed faster despite less power than at lower altitudes? \n\nBecause TRUE airspeed goes up as you get higher in altitude. \n\nSo are they measuring INDICATED/CALIBRATED airspeed (as seen on your instruments) or TRUE airspeed (true airspeed through the air mass)? \n\nBecause your indicated airspeed (which is roughly what your aircraft is measuring as its interaction with the air... hence stall speeds are typically based on your indicated airspeed) at higher altitudes will be much lower than your true airspeed - but you want true airspeed corrected for wind to get your groundspeed to measure your actual speed over the ground, which is what you use to figure out navigation.\n\nSo what is the P-51 actually referencing? \n\nTurns out, [it is more often TRUE airspeed](http://www.wwiiaircraftperformance.org/mustang/mustangtest.html)than indicated airspeed! Note that almost all the figures being thrown around for top speeds are roughly 440ish mph in true airspeed.\n\n440 mph = 382 knots. So for true airspeed at 30k, that's approximately 242 knots calibrated on a standard day.\n\nYou should note that the speeds listed for the Super Tucano and T-6 Texan II for max speed are also its never exceed speed (~316-320 knots indicated). 316-320 KIAS at even 20k is ~425 knots... 489 mph. That's way faster than the top speed of the P-51!\n\nThat's the never exceed speed, however, which usually is some fuselage/airframe limit and not normally achievable in straight and level flight.\n\nNavy CNATRA (flight training) publishes the T-6B Texan II's primary contact training publication: https://www.cnatra.navy.mil/local/docs/pat-pubs/P-764.pdf\n\nNote on page 83 of the PDF, that FAST CRUISE is 240 KIAS (80% power) - normal cruise is 200 KIAS (54% power).\n\nAgain, that's INDICATED airspeed. So at fast cruise at 30,000 feet... 240 KIAS (assuming no major instrumentation errors) gets you ~378 KTAS which is ~434 mph.\n\nIs 440 mph slower than 434 mph?\n\nOf course not. Note too that those are without the T-6B at MIL power - which means they could conceivably go even faster (not necessarily at 30k of course, you have less power available).\n\nSo no, the P-51 is not drastically faster than the Super Tucano or other modern turboprops.\n\nIt's one of my favorite things to remind flight students I come across flying the T-6A/B - you're being trusted to fly an airplane that performs similar to or outperformed most of the top of the line WW2-era fighters, and to really take it in and enjoy what you're being entrusted to do.",

            "body": "Because horsepower ratings are vague guides as are weight. Aircraft would have war emergency power ratings and their output could vary on things like fuel You will also get different speeds on things like external equipment causing drag and how much weight you actually have.\n\nAlso in WWII the engine powers just a huge amount. Engines like the Merlin went from around 1000hp at the start of the war to over 2000hp at the end so the engine power increased in the space of months.\n\nAlso the airframes would have differences. The trainers will have big bubble canopies for the two pilots and the fighter smaller canopy for just the one, this will change the parasitic drag. The trainer will likely be more optimised for stability in the lower atmosphere while the fighter will have its wing form optimised for high altitude speed. This may affect their ability to hit peak speed at optimal altitude.\n\nI can't give a definitive answer but my guess is the WWII fighter had a much higher risk tolerance on its engine to push it past its bench numbers when going for high speed in testing and in combat and was much better at high speed high altitude aerodynamically.",
            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Because horsepower ratings are vague guides as are weight. Aircraft would have war emergency power ratings and their output could vary on things like fuel You will also get different speeds on things like external equipment causing drag and how much weight you actually have.</p>\n\n<p>Also in WWII the engine powers just a huge amount. Engines like the Merlin went from around 1000hp at the start of the war to over 2000hp at the end so the engine power increased in the space of months.</p>\n\n<p>Also the airframes would have differences.
