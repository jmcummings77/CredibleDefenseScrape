I think discussions are under way with the Americans.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year QinetiQ, the Hampshire-based defence technology company, worked with the Ministry of Defence on a drone programme to \u201cprovide recommendations for uncrewed aircraft systems that could be deployed readily by the Ukrainian military\u201d.\n\nAccording to QinetiQ, one of the test projects included a 3D-printed delta-wing \u201csuicide\u201d drone. There was no indication that this was the weapon procured for Ukraine.\n\nIn February, Mr Sunak pledged that the UK would supply Kyiv with longer-range capabilities that would \u201cdisrupt Russia\u2019s ability to continually target Ukraine\u2019s civilian and critical national infrastructure and help relieve pressure on Ukraine\u2019s front lines\u201d.\n\nEarlier this month, Ukraine was forced to deny involvement in a drone attack that struck the Kremlin, with Western officials unclear on the source of the drones.

The Dutch Air Force is already moving to the F-35. The device has been in use there since 2019. At the same time, the Netherlands still has 24 F-16s on hand. They can serve in Ukraine. According to Prime Minister Mark Rutte, there are 'no taboos' and the file is being worked on 'intensively'. Denmark is also already making the switch to F-35. The Danes want to make a decision about their F-16 fleet (43 pieces) by the summer.\n\n>In any case, permission from Washington DC is needed to send American-made F-16s to the front in Ukraine. Just as Berlin had to formally give its permission to Poland at the beginning of this year, among others, for the supply of modern Leopard tanks.\n\nAlso, side note. In the article they say F-16\u2019s instead of F-16s. Do apostrophes work differently in Dutch than English, or do they also suffer from the errant apostrophe issue that seems to plague English?",

DPICM ammunition has been in use by the U.S. military since the 1970s.  An area weapon, or in other words a \u201ccluster munition\u201d DPICM ammunition is typically 5-15 times more effective per round than the older high explosive (acronym is HE) artillery rounds the U.S. is currently providing to Ukraine.\n\n>The USSR and later Russia was always expected to be a much larger military. The US and NATO, relied on superior technology, soldiers, and training.* And more lethal conventional munitions.* \n\n>Our NATO artillery was expected to be far outnumbered by Russian artillery in a 10:1 ratio.  NATO had standardized on the same size artillery shell, 155mm, and all NATO members expected to fire much better ammo than the Russians fire.   We always planned to use Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions (DPICM). While not matching the Russians on a one for one artillery tube vs artillery tube ratio, the DPICM round was a force multiplier, making one artillery tube much more powerful. Each artillery round contained 88 submunitions. The round would explode in the air prior to hitting the target and scatter the 88 submunitions that each submunition explodes on impact below.  It is not indiscriminate; it is highly accurate and fired only at known military targets.  Instead of firing one high explosive shell (HE) which hits one target, the DPICM round would release 88 submunitions and hit 88 targets across a 150-meter radius. One DPICM round is much more lethal than one high explosive (HE) round. *The use of DPICM has always been the strategy to counter Russian numerical superiority.*\n\n>When Ukrainian units are being attacked by Russians now, if they have Ukrainian artillery, they are unfortunately firing 155mm high explosive (HE) rounds. I learned this when I was in combat on the front lines in the Donbas and was shocked. This high explosive round, while sounding ominous, is far inferior to firing DPICM. DPICM is between 5-15 times more lethal than high explosive (HE) depending on terrain, weather and other variables. That means fewer Russian soldiers killed per round, and more Ukrainian soldiers (and civilians) die in this war. If NATO would supply DPICM 155mm rounds, it would level the playing field and save Ukrainian lives, both military and civilian.  In most wars, artillery is the #1 killer on the battlefield, as it is in the Ukraine war.  To increase Ukrainian artillery lethality instantly to be 5-15 times more powerful, will be a game changer.  And it is simply changing the shells that are being fired, no training necessary.  And millions of artillery rounds are already in Europe and can be on the battlefield within days. For most of the war, Ukraine has been on the defensive, which usually has fewer casualties, than the force on the offensive. If Ukraine is to take back the Donbas and Crimea, Ukraine needs to go on the offensive. Without overwhelming force, Ukraine will take *significant* casualties in the offensive against overwhelming enemy artillery fires. DPICM will significantly reduce Ukrainian casualties in the offensive action that is needed to win. \n\n>Because DPICM is the most lethal artillery, and because it was the primary planned defense ammo for the defense of Europe to defeat a potential Russian invasion, it was also the most massed produced.  We have millions of rounds of DPICM.  We are running out of ammo, but we aren\u2019t using the most lethal and most mass-produced ammo. \n\n>General Zaluzhnyi has requested DPICM.  I know this because after learning from Ukraine they were only receiving High Explosive; I advised the General staff to requests DPICM.  General Zaluzhnyi approved and he spoke with the U.S. The Ukrainians will fire it on their own Ukrainian land, only against Russian military targets. Zelensky and Zaluzhnyi go into this fully knowing if they fire DPICM that it will be more deadly than HE against the Russian invaders. But it will have the downside to leaving UXO\u2019s throughout anywhere they fight the Russians. They understand the risks and still request DPICM, because they know that the existential risk of not using them is much greater.",

Europe enjoyed decades of peace by confining a dangerous ideology to the bowels of history. It did so by helping the German people out of their misery and helping them rebuild their country; but also by treating that heinous ideology like a mortal danger, denying any kind of agency or refuge to those who sought to make it see the light of day again. Levying damages only against Putin and his cronies without that is even worse than mindlessly pilaging the Russian economy: all it does is ensure that anyone who supports Putin's dangerous ideology but was smart enough to keep quiet these years has a chance to succeed him, and will also enjoy ample economic resources to finish what Putin and his cronies were too incompetent to do.\n\nSecond, I think this would set a very dangerous precedent in and of itself. Countries aren't the government's property. International relations are implemented by heads of state because that's one of the things in their job descriptions; but international relations are established between *states*, not heads of state. Putin didn't invade Ukraine, Russia did. Putin didn't personally select every bombing target. He directed the issuing of orders that presumably involved only legitimate military action, not patrols and, you know, the occasional rape because what's a soldier gonna do. There's an entire state apparatus that worked to implement every single thing that happened, and tolerated every single thing it shouldn't have tolerated. Putin may have directly enacted a small number of them, but even then, he did so in his role as head of state, without the authority of which no one would've lifted a finger.\n\nSaddling him and a few close associates with responsibility for the policies of the Russian state isn't just ridiculous in the face of facts, it's a dangerous precedent because it then absolves states of responsibility for failed policies. You can't just vote someone out of office or have him retire and then go well, that wasn't *us*, it was just, you know, that one dude. Can you imagine what a shit world we'd inhabit if it were only Kennedy and Nixon that learned the lessons of Vietnam, or only Brezhnev, Andropov, Chernenko and Gorbachev that learned the lessons of Afghanistan, and those lessons had died with them?\n\nThird, this idea that the Russian people just had to go along with it all is, I think, the most dangerous prejudice of them all. People are not powerless, absolutely do have a choice, and while support is rarely as universal as regimes claim, it's also far more widespread that people claim post-factum.\n\nFormer autocracies make for the whackiest of tales. You ask someone if *all that stuff* -- the labour camps, the beatings, the torture, the rapes, the extrajudicial killings -- is true, and they'll say, yes, I lived through it. But everyone disapproved. So you go on and ask, okay, uncle/grandpa/grandma/whatever, but... how did you reconcile working and living here with *all that*?\n\nOh, they'll say, that was horrible, but... you know, we were all state employees, but I didn't work for the State Security, you know. Or, okay, I worked for the State Security but I was just an accountant, I wasn't an operative agent and I never went near a prison. Or, okay, I worked at this or that labour camp briefly but I was a medic, I wasn't a guard. Okay, I was a guard, but I was one of the nice ones, I helped prisoners smuggle cigarettes and whatever.\n\nIt's mindboggling: heinous crimes were perpetrated on a massive scale, but somehow you never run into anyone who perpetrated them. Talking to people you'd get the impression that the government was the bloody NHS, everyone was either a medic or an accountant, and somehow prisoners managed to beat themselves to death.\n\nIt's not like democracy and humanity grow on trees elsewhere in the world. All these regimes that, thankfully, most of us only read about in history books now didn't just accidentally spring into existence and started oppressing their people. They were brought into power, and supported, by people, all of whom absolutely had a choice in the matter. And they endured because so many of them made the wrong choice that all these crimes you hear about even today, committed by the Russian military in Ukraine, were normalized. What *should* have been intolerable -- exacting suffering on those who are truly powerless -- became not just tolerable, but a norm, and it did so because people absolutely supported it, in massive numbers, and participated in it, so willingly and on such a scale that taking a stand against it became a faux-pas, in addition to, or separately from, being outright dangerous.\n\nPeople in half of Europe - the Eastern half, to be precise - reclaimed control over their countries not by having democratic regimes cast upon them from heavens, but by making the choice Russian people now claim not to have. It was a bloody affair - even regimes that crumbled peacefully in the late eighties did so after decades of internal struggle, littered with suffering and abuse. But the idea that Ukrainian citizens should pay with their suffering because Russian people would rather not meet the riot police that they themselves cheer for at the May 9th parade is ridiculous, and illustrative for the sort of cowardice that the Soviet Union, sadly, drilled into so many of its citizens that we're still trying to shake it off, decades after its fall.",

Having something like, the next 10 generation of you and your childrens cannot go into europe, US, Canada, Japan, Australia etc might have an effect.</p>\n\n<p>Edit - this is a shower thought, not a conviction</p>\n</div>",

As /u/RevolutionaryPanic pointed out [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/13j369y/credibledefense_daily_megathread_may_16_2023/jkfh404/), Putin's regime is on solid ground because, for twenty years, although the result of the elections may not have reflected the exact candidate choices of most Russians (not the least because some of them weren't allowed to run), the ensuing government certainly represented the goals and aspirations of most Russians.\n\nUnless you literally rig elections by printing votes -- which the Russian regime never had to do, and not even it fiercest critics accused it of -- you usually get to tilt a close balance, not turn a tiny minority vote into absolute majority.",

The fundamental problem with Patriot in 1991 was that it was pressed into a role the system was neither designed nor tested for. Prior to August 1990, Scud was not a target Patriot was even intended to defeat, and a number of Scuds used by Iraq were the indigenous Al Hussein variant modified for greater burnout velocity and range. Not only was that weapon nearly half a kilometer per second faster than the threats Patriot was designed against, but the quick and dirty nature of the modification also led to a tendency for the missiles to break up when hitting the lower atmosphere. Patriot would frequently home in on other fragments of Scuds rather than the warhead, which to the radar was just another piece of debris.\n\n> Prior to 1991, the most complex target either the PAC-1 or PAC-2 systems had engaged was surplus MGM-52 Lance TBMs, which was an acceptable analog for the SS-21, which was the threshold target for the system, but not the longer ranged SS-23 which was the objective threat. The program office simply hadn't progressed the system to the point where it was ready to defeat more complex threats. When it became clear Patriot was going to be forced into defending against Scuds, the program office and Raytheon attempted to deploy a series of rapid software updates, but there was no time to actually test against a representative target. The first time Patriot engaged a Scud in combat was the first time the system ever attempted to engage a 500 km class missile in the real world. No system will succeed when forced to perform before real time. The clock error was the biggest problem, but not the only one. \n\n> A far bigger problem was the PAC-2 interceptor's fuze, which was not accurate enough for the closing velocities involved in a Scud intercept. Interceptors would frequently detonate after passing the target, failing to damage it at all. This is where the original >90% intercept rate came from: operators would see the indicator that the interceptor had fuzed, which was used to report a kill. Furthermore, PAC-2 units in Saudi Arabia had no ability to record engagements out of fear of a recorder causing issues with the immature software. Units in Israel however had such recorders, and that may have correlated with those units' lower success rates. But it is impossible to know for certain.\n\n> It actually isn't known for absolute certainty what the true success rate for Patriot was during the war. The only way to ascertain such a number would be to physically examine the wreckage of every target launched against, which is frequently difficult to impossible. This is not helped by the aforementioned willingness of Al Husseins to self-destruct. There is also a giant debate over what constitutes a successful intercept\u2014does merely breaking up the target and causing it to impact away from the defended area count, or is it destroying the entire warhead required to be considered successful?\n\n> Anyway, the point of this massive series of tangents is to say the failures of Patriot were multifaceted, yet came from a single root cause\u2014the system being pressed into a mission it was not even intended for. If you ask me, the fact that there is strong evidence that the system successfully defeated four Scuds during the course of the war far exceeds any reasonable expectation. Problem is, most expectations from both outside and within the Army were not reasonable.\n\n> Later developments such as the Quick Reaction Program, subsequent Post Deployment Builds of PAC-2, PAC-2 GEM-T, and eventually PAC-3 built upon lessons learned and far more aggressive testing against representative targets.\n\nEnd copy paste.\n\nOver the last quarter century, Patriot has been tested against an increasingly more capable and sophisticated threat set, including but not limited to: \n\n* Both simple and complex, separating ballistic missiles \n\n* Maneuvering reentry vehicles\n\n* Separating MRBMs in the 1000+ km class\n\n* Aeroballistic missiles representing threats similar to Kinzhal and Iskander\n\n* Multiple cruise missile types, including supersonic threats\n\nThe situation is fundamentally different than thirty two years ago. This is not a system still deep in development, only having undergone limited testing against a simple threat. It is a highly mature weapon system capable against the overwhelming majority of threats it is intended to defeat, with a consistent development of upgrades to software and hardware to meet new threats.

Now it\u2019s reaching a breaking point.\n\n>Khan\u2019s dramatic arrest by dozens of paramilitary rangers last week for graft triggered protests that left at least eight people dead and hundreds injured, risking more spasms of violence in a nation struggling to pull back from economic collapse. By detaining the former premier, Pakistani authorities have drawn a line in the sand: Khan is an outcast in the eyes of the state, including among former army allies, and many are increasingly ready to bear the consequences of stopping him.\n\n>\u201cThis is a very fragile moment,\u201d said Avinash Paliwal, the deputy director of the South Asia Institute at SOAS University of London. \u201cWhat will happen to Khan really depends on two factors: how enduring the protesters are in their drive to support who they see as their leader, and how much force the army is willing to use to crush dissent.\u201d\n\n>Though Pakistan\u2019s top court ordered Khan\u2019s release, calling the nature of his arrest illegal, and the Islamabad High Court later granted him bail in the land graft case, the former leader\u2019s fate is far from certain even as he\u2019s seeking preemptive bail in the dozens of other cases he faces. \n\n>His detention marks a climactic moment after months of bitter public sparring with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif\u2019s government and the military. The political crisis comes as Pakistan is grappling with its worst economic crisis in years. Record inflation, scant currency reserves and a still-delayed bailout from the International Monetary Fund are among the South Asian nation\u2019s challenges.\n\n>The army didn\u2019t respond to an email and several text messages seeking comments for this story.\n\n>>Sparring With the Generals\n\n>But it\u2019s Khan\u2019s falling out with Pakistan\u2019s army that could ultimately decide his political fate, and whether he\u2019ll have the ability to contest elections expected in the fall. Though the military was seen as instrumental in bringing Khan to power in 2018, relations soured in late 2021 when Khan tried to block the removal of a favored general from his post as head of its spy wing, the Inter-Services Intelligence agency.\n\n>A few months later, in April 2022, Khan was removed as prime minister in a no-confidence vote. He accused Sharif and other politicians of conspiring with former army leader General Qamar Javed Bajwa to topple his government, saying \u2014 without evidence \u2014 that it was because he had been critical of the US and was seeking closer ties with Russia and China.\n\n>Khan also claimed \u2014 once again without offering proof \u2014 that Sharif\u2019s government and a senior general were behind a shooting attack at a street protest in November that left him with a leg injury. That allegation was also rebuffed.\n\n>Pakistan\u2019s military has long held sway in the country, ruling directly for 32 of the 76 years since independence and backing many of its civilian regimes. Though the army vowed last year to stay out of politics in a surprising admission of past involvement, Khan\u2019s arrest now casts doubt on that promise.\n\n>\u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily the political government which is removing him,\u201d said Ayesha Siddiqa, a researcher of South Asian issues at Kings College in London. \u201cIt\u2019s the army using the political government to remove him.\u201d\n\n>>Risky Strategy\n\n>Still, trying to keep Khan, 70, behind bars is a risky strategy. The former leader continues to have massive support in Pakistan and his willingness to take on the army is popular among many voters. The 650,000-strong force is facing unprecedented condemnation on social media after years when people didn\u2019t dare speak out. \n\n>After Khan\u2019s arrest by Pakistan\u2019s anti-graft agency, rioters breached the army\u2019s headquarters in Rawalpindi and set a commander\u2019s home ablaze.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-16/imran-khan-s-face-off-with-pakistan-army-escalates-after-arrest?srnd=politics-vp\">Imran Khan\u2019s Face Off With Pakistan Army Escalates After Arrest</a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Former leader\u2019s detention puts a question mark over elections</li>\n<li>Economy risks further hits as fears mount over social unrest</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Since his ouster as prime minister last year, Imran Khan has played a high-stakes game of challenging Pakistan\u2019s powerful military. Now it\u2019s reaching a breaking point.</p>\n\n<p>Khan\u2019s dramatic arrest by dozens of paramilitary rangers last week for graft triggered protests that left at least eight people dead and hundreds injured, risking more spasms of violence in a nation struggling to pull back from economic collapse. By detaining the former premier, Pakistani authorities have drawn a line in the sand: Khan is an outcast in the eyes of the state, including among former army allies, and many are increasingly ready to bear the consequences of stopping him.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis is a very fragile moment,\u201d said Avinash Paliwal, the deputy director of the South Asia Institute at SOAS University of London. \u201cWhat will happen to Khan really depends on two factors: how enduring the protesters are in their drive to support who they see as their leader, and how much force the army is willing to use to crush dissent.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Though Pakistan\u2019s top court ordered Khan\u2019s release, calling the nature of his arrest illegal, and the Islamabad High Court later granted him bail in the land graft case, the former leader\u2019s fate is far from certain even as he\u2019s seeking preemptive bail in the dozens of other cases he faces. </p>\n\n<p>His detention marks a climactic moment after months of bitter public sparring with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif\u2019s government and the military. The political crisis comes as Pakistan is grappling with its worst economic crisis in years. Record inflation, scant currency reserves and a still-delayed bailout from the International Monetary Fund are among the South Asian nation\u2019s challenges.</p>\n\n<p>The army didn\u2019t respond to an email and several text messages seeking comments for this story.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sparring With the Generals</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But it\u2019s Khan\u2019s falling out with Pakistan\u2019s army that could ultimately decide his political fate, and whether he\u2019ll have the ability to contest elections expected in the fall. Though the military was seen as instrumental in bringing Khan to power in 2018, relations soured in late 2021 when Khan tried to block the removal of a favored general from his post as head of its spy wing, the Inter-Services Intelligence agency.</p>\n\n<p>A few months later, in April 2022, Khan was removed as prime minister in a no-confidence vote. He accused Sharif and other politicians of conspiring with former army leader General Qamar Javed Bajwa to topple his government, saying \u2014 without evidence \u2014 that it was because he had been critical of the US and was seeking closer ties with Russia and China.</p>\n\n<p>Khan also claimed \u2014 once again without offering proof \u2014 that Sharif\u2019s government and a senior general were behind a shooting attack at a street protest in November that left him with a leg injury. That allegation was also rebuffed.</p>\n\n<p>Pakistan\u2019s military has long held sway in the country, ruling directly for 32 of the 76 years since independence and backing many of its civilian regimes. Though the army vowed last year to stay out of politics in a surprising admission of past involvement, Khan\u2019s arrest now casts doubt on that promise.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily the political government which is removing him,\u201d said Ayesha Siddiqa, a researcher of South Asian issues at Kings College in London. \u201cIt\u2019s the army using the political government to remove him.\u201d</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Risky Strategy</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Still, trying to keep Khan, 70, behind bars is a risky strategy. The former leader continues to have massive support in Pakistan and his willingness to take on the army is popular among many voters. The 650,000-strong force is facing unprecedented condemnation on social media after years when people didn\u2019t dare speak out. </p>\n\n<p>After Khan\u2019s arrest by Pakistan\u2019s anti-graft agency, rioters breached the army\u2019s headquarters in Rawalpindi and set a commander\u2019s home ablaze. Sharif has ordered security officials to arrest anybody involved.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe will create an example out of the miscreants who vandalized and attacked state institutions so that such an incident never takes place in Pakistan again,\u201d he said at a recent press conference.</p>\n\n<p>On Friday, Khan was granted bail in eight cases against him and given broad protection from future arrests. But the government has vowed to find other ways to silence him, signaling that the showdown is far from over. Even if he avoids a conviction in the graft case, Khan faces nearly 150 other charges, including terrorism, hiding assets and insulting a female judge \u2014 all of which he\u2019s denied. </p>\n\n<p>All the while, Pakistan\u2019s historic economic crisis is only worsening, with stark examples of surging prices, poverty and desperation emerging by the day. The benchmark interest rate is at an all-time high of 21%. And after Khan\u2019s arrest, the rupee \u2014 Asia\u2019s worst performing currency in the past year \u2014 slumped to a record low of 300 to the dollar.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

The rebuttal is usually \"why take Chinese vaporware any more seriously  than Russian\", something about corruption in China where China is a giant Russia, that China has promised the moon before, and often unsoureced claims that X sucks about J20 (RCS from certain aspects, engines unreliable, etc)\n\nAnd the thing is I can't fully argue with any of these. I did moderately buy into Russian hype. I thought SU57 would be more impactful, even if limited, by using it at key points.

Lockheed Martin made that choice because of our real-time RedHawk Linux operating system, NightStar development and analysis tools, and our reliable long-term program support. Concurrent solutions allow military organizations to install software and other technology upgrades faster and less expensively.\n\nAnd here's the Wikipedia snippet on RTOSes.\n\n>A **real-time operating system (RTOS)** is an operating system (OS) for [real-time computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing) applications that processes data and events that have critically defined time constraints. An RTOS is distinct from a [time-sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-sharing) operating system, such as Unix, which manages the sharing of system resources with a scheduler, data buffers, or fixed task prioritization in a multitasking or multiprogramming environment. Processing time requirements need to be fully understood and bound rather than just kept as a minimum. All processing must occur within the defined constraints. Real-time operating systems are [event-driven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming) and [preemptive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preemption_\\(computing\\)), meaning the OS can monitor the relevant priority of competing tasks, and make changes to the task priority. Event-driven systems switch between tasks based on their priorities, while time-sharing systems switch the task based on clock [interrupts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupts).\n\n>**Characteristics**\n\n>A key characteristic of an RTOS is the level of its consistency concerning the amount of time it takes to accept and complete an application's [task](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_\\(computing\\)); the variability is ['jitter'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jitter).[1] A 'hard' real-time operating system (hard RTOS) has less jitter than a 'soft' real-time operating system (soft RTOS). A late answer is a wrong answer in a hard RTOS while a late answer is acceptable in a soft RTOS. The chief design goal is not high [throughput](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throughput), but rather a guarantee of a [soft or hard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing#Criteria_for_real-time_computing) performance category. An RTOS that can usually or generally meet a deadline is a soft real-time OS, but if it can meet a deadline deterministically it is a hard real-time OS.[2]\n\n>An RTOS has an advanced algorithm for [scheduling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduling_\\(computing\\)). Scheduler flexibility enables a wider, computer-system orchestration of process priorities, but a real-time OS is more frequently dedicated to a narrow set of applications. Key factors in a real-time OS are minimal [interrupt latency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt_latency) and minimal [thread switching latency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_switching_latency); a real-time OS is valued more for how quickly or how predictably it can respond than for the amount of work it can perform in a given period of time.[3]\n\n>See the [comparison of real-time operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_real-time_operating_systems) for a comprehensive list. Also, see the [list of operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_operating_systems) for all types of operating systems.",

You want to get the Patriot to engage a Kalibur or Kinzahl, you need them to fly like that weapon, which means you need it to be launched by a similar platform and fly with more or less the same profile.

What makes more sense is in using a swarm of missiles, all live, to do what you want them to do. This was a core component of Soviet doctrine, and a good example of this in practice appears in *Red Storm Rising*. There Soviet Backfire naval bombers launch a swarm attack against a US CVBG by launching an overwhelming number of missiles across a large threat arc, overwhelm defenses, and break through. A part of the swarm attack is in exhausting AA ammunition. BUT! While it works in a novel, you need a *lot* of missiles to overwhelm or deplete an AA battery. The Patriot system has a high kill rate, so you overwhelming missile attack isn't going to do much, its going to cost you your own limited supply of offensive missiles, and may not deplete the missiles youre targeting anyway! \n\nThe only time I can think of when an AD network was depleted in the way people are talking about here was during Operation Linebacker, when the North Vietnamese had just (according to their own internal docs, see Pierre Asselin, *A Bitter Peace*) a few days worth of SA-2s left and were seriously worried that they would no longer be able to engage B-52s attacking Hanoi. Importantly tho, they never crossed that AD threshold. I'm not really familiar with any other cases where a massive air attack really depleted the defender's missiles in this way, the lesson there is that decoys or not you really cant cause long term disruptions in an AD network like that.

I&#39;m just illustrating that it does matter, because it is not a one-time event, it&#39;s a deficit trade that you have to make repeatedly, over and over again. (And I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s always wrong to make a deficit trade either, sometimes you trade 2 for 1 all day if you&#39;re the bigger empire, but it is what it is)  </p>\n\n<p>Analogizing with dollars probably muddied the waters though, and that&#39;s my mistake. It&#39;s an imperfect shorthand to inventory and production rate, which is what <em>really</em> matters.</p>\n</div>",
