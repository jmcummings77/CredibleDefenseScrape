But are much less survivable and much less ergonomic for more than a few hours use.\n\nProblem for the Russians is we are not sending Cheiftans and M-60s to fight their T-72Bs. For any tank upgraded from 1990 onward it will have laser range finders and targeting computers that have increasing probabilities of first shot on target on the move. They also have increasingly sophisticated thermal imagers and night sights that allow far better night manoeuvre and fighting capability; for those upgraded from the late 90s onwards you start getting multiple thermals so the commander and gunner can do different tasks at the same time (called Hunter Killer).\n\nMore recent models include \"digital battlefield\" upgrades that allow the tanks and other IFVs, APCs etc to communicate with each other and work in very close coordination.\n\nSending heaps of Leopard 2 A4s will be mid 80s tanks likely with thermals and targeting systems upgrades. Everything after that starts getting into over match with many Russian tanks that would sound like hyperbole.\n\nModernised Russian tanks like T-90M and T-72B3M have had thermals upgrades. But its only one per tank, no idea the quality and these are not the bulk of their forces (putting it mildly).\n\nAll said and done the IFVs like Bradley and CV-90 will have the biggest impact by a distance. But the post 2000 western tanks should be serious force multipliers for those.\n\nEven the 14 Challanger 2s should work with a battalion to M2s and be devastating to much larger Russian formations.

Of all the Western militaries, pretty much only Finland is actually well versed in the sort of &quot;low-tech&quot; war that Ukraine mostly is fighting... and the high-tech part, that is, the drone use and Starlink and whatever, is something that was pretty much invented during this war by Ukrainians (minor credit to Russians) and Finland doesn&#39;t yet implement.</p>\n\n<p>Taiwan&#39;s military is currently in a very poor state and in dire need of renovation. They reduced their military capabilities by a lot over the past few decades due to fears of a new military leadership and resignation to Chinese victory. However - they do seem determined to renovate now, with e.g. conscription lengthened to a full year again (from just four months).</p>\n</div>",

So nobody is supposed to pick and choose which order they obey, if they're given an order, which includes written regulations, they're supposed to follow them all equally. So getting a proper haircut, shaving, or wearing the uniform correctly are viewed by some, especially professional soldiers who are overly focused on garrison soldier mindset, as important indicators as whether their subordinates will also do more important things like staying awake on guard duty, cleaning their weapons or doing vehicle maintenance, obeying orders in combat, etc, because if they don't do the former they won't do the latter. In theory. \n\nThe correlation is mostly bullshit, there are plenty of examples of well disciplined troops who will do the latter but not former, but it's just how modern military tradition works, it stems from the 18th-19th century where pretty soldiers were only pretty because they were forced to be pretty by the same officers who also made sure they were drilled hard, and usually fought better than sloppy looking soldiers, who were also usually not drilled hard. But times have changed. \n\nBesides tradition, it's focused on nowadays because appearance is very easy to check, a lazy leader can glance at troops from a distance and mentally gauge their discipline by how they look, versus checking the important stuff requires lots of work by the leaders since it means they need to get to know their subordinates, physically check on the guards at zero dark thirty hours, they need to get their hands dirty to check weapons and equipment, and they actually have to lead troops in combat to know they're obeying orders, etc.",

            "body": "Amateur commentator here and, far, far, leagues removed from an \"Erdogan stan,\" but I do have a problematic relationship with the talk of expulsion with respect to Turkey. Despite my vociferously and unanimously negative feelings towards Erdogan, such a move would deliver significant benefits to both the Turkish hard-right and Russians to the extent that any \"real\" benefits to the rest of the NATO alliance (if they even exist, in the first place) would be completely and totally negated, in my view.  \n\nIn short, the tldr is - this would be a huge victory for Russia and increase insecurity in the Black Sea; the Turkish role in NATO has always been politically difficult (i.e. Cyprus); and it would be a huge strategic risk to undertake without clear benefits to defeat Erdogan or his ideology. \n\n* Turkey's importance in NATO - Turkey occupies a very key strategic region, and any discussion of contemplating expulsion has to be coupled with a discussion of what happens in the days, weeks, and years after - in short, if you hate Turkey in NATO, you'll hate them even more outside of NATO\n   * The most obvious path is the Black Sea, in which Russia would have considerable flexibility to operate with a non-aligned Turkish government, directly threatening the security of NATO's Black Sea-bordering nations (Romania and Bulgaria especially) \n   * The Aegean Sea would also become much more of a headache than it already is to manage without the framework of NATO above \\*both\\* (and I stress, \\*both\\*) the Greeks and Turks - as much as Macron/the French like to saber rattle against Erdogan when this topic comes up, such a conflict (especially now) would be enough to make the Iraq War of 2003 look like an act of masterful diplomacy \n* History -  Turkey has, for the entirety of its history, been a uniquely difficult relationship within NATO, and Erdogan is far from an exception to that rule \n   * While the Cold War arguably saw NATO have a much more lenient view towards dictatorships / authoritarian countries (notably, Portugal) - the Greeks and the Turks both joined the alliance in \\*1952\\* \n   * That means you had a whole slew of conflicts that intersected with their overlapping relationship in NATO - the Invasion of Cyprus happened in \\*1974\\* - I'm no expert on the conflict, but I'm sure there are those more educated on how NATO handled that headache (iirc, this is the most notable inter-state conflict between NATO, but my history isn't great in the Cold War arena in case there's any I'm forgetting about, besides the Cod Wars) \n   * Domestically, Turkish politics has been troubling for a long time before Erdogan - this isn't to write off the very legitimate civil society that has emerged since the mid-20th century, but there's no \"golden age\" of secular politicians who weren't nationalistic on the Aegean (again, Cyprus 1974) or the Kurds before Erdogan (there's a reason there were all those coups!) \n* Strategic rationale - this is arguably the point that gets overlooked the most in these discussions and the one I have the greatest issue with - what exactly would this accomplish? \n   * Sure, there's likely a short-term political hit to Erdogan's capital domestically and, depending on the policies done afterwards (sanctions, etc.) that might even cost him the 2023 election - but that's a very big if \n   * Erdogan isn't exactly a dictator in clean terms - while there have been arrests and the shenanigans surrounding the Istanbul elections - it's overly simplistic to write off his election victories as fraudulent, especially given the disorganization of the opposition in this period \n   * Nobody really has a crystal ball into how the 2023 elections will be handled relative to the past (though the linear historical trend has not been positive in this regard), and even if Erdogan loses, would Turkey just automatically be re-admitted under the next CHP government? Would there be continual expulsions if the AKP/MHP coalition won the next election? \n\nTo conclude, using expulsion in the context of NATO (a military alliance with a clear, defined purpose) is the wrong tool. This is one of the reasons why EU enlargement has been a great tool alongside NATO expansion, since the institution is geared with the requisite criteria and incentives to deal with these problems and a somewhat hazy, if not entirely clear, playing field for these issues to be addressed. As such, I don't really see a NATO expulsion mechanism as being an effective political tool for actually addressing the issues in problematic NATO countries, be it Turkey (or Hungary, for that matter).",

Despite my vociferously and unanimously negative feelings towards Erdogan, such a move would deliver significant benefits to both the Turkish hard-right and Russians to the extent that any &quot;real&quot; benefits to the rest of the NATO alliance (if they even exist, in the first place) would be completely and totally negated, in my view.  </p>\n\n<p>In short, the tldr is - this would be a huge victory for Russia and increase insecurity in the Black Sea; the Turkish role in NATO has always been politically difficult (i.e. Cyprus); and it would be a huge strategic risk to undertake without clear benefits to defeat Erdogan or his ideology. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Turkey&#39;s importance in NATO - Turkey occupies a very key strategic region, and any discussion of contemplating expulsion has to be coupled with a discussion of what happens in the days, weeks, and years after - in short, if you hate Turkey in NATO, you&#39;ll hate them even more outside of NATO\n\n<ul>\n<li>The most obvious path is the Black Sea, in which Russia would have considerable flexibility to operate with a non-aligned Turkish government, directly threatening the security of NATO&#39;s Black Sea-bordering nations (Romania and Bulgaria especially) </li>\n<li>The Aegean Sea would also become much more of a headache than it already is to manage without the framework of NATO above *both* (and I stress, *both*) the Greeks and Turks - as much as Macron/the French like to saber rattle against Erdogan when this topic comes up, such a conflict (especially now) would be enough to make the Iraq War of 2003 look like an act of masterful diplomacy </li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>History -  Turkey has, for the entirety of its history, been a uniquely difficult relationship within NATO, and Erdogan is far from an exception to that rule \n\n<ul>\n<li>While the Cold War arguably saw NATO have a much more lenient view towards dictatorships / authoritarian countries (notably, Portugal) - the Greeks and the Turks both joined the alliance in *1952* </li>\n<li>That means you had a whole slew of conflicts that intersected with their overlapping relationship in NATO - the Invasion of Cyprus happened in *1974* - I&#39;m no expert on the conflict, but I&#39;m sure there are those more educated on how NATO handled that headache (iirc, this is the most notable inter-state conflict between NATO, but my history isn&#39;t great in the Cold War arena in case there&#39;s any I&#39;m forgetting about, besides the Cod Wars) </li>\n<li>Domestically, Turkish politics has been troubling for a long time before Erdogan - this isn&#39;t to write off the very legitimate civil society that has emerged since the mid-20th century, but there&#39;s no &quot;golden age&quot; of secular politicians who weren&#39;t nationalistic on the Aegean (again, Cyprus 1974) or the Kurds before Erdogan (there&#39;s a reason there were all those coups!) </li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Strategic rationale - this is arguably the point that gets overlooked the most in these discussions and the one I have the greatest issue with - what exactly would this accomplish? \n\n<ul>\n<li>Sure, there&#39;s likely a short-term political hit to Erdogan&#39;s capital domestically and, depending on the policies done afterwards (sanctions, etc.) that might even cost him the 2023 election - but that&#39;s a very big if </li>\n<li>Erdogan isn&#39;t exactly a dictator in clean terms - while there have been arrests and the shenanigans surrounding the Istanbul elections - it&#39;s overly simplistic to write off his election victories as fraudulent, especially given the disorganization of the opposition in this period </li>\n<li>Nobody really has a crystal ball into how the 2023 elections will be handled relative to the past (though the linear historical trend has not been positive in this regard), and even if Erdogan loses, would Turkey just automatically be re-admitted under the next CHP government? Would there be continual expulsions if the AKP/MHP coalition won the next election? </li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To conclude, using expulsion in the context of NATO (a military alliance with a clear, defined purpose) is the wrong tool. This is one of the reasons why EU enlargement has been a great tool alongside NATO expansion, since the institution is geared with the requisite criteria and incentives to deal with these problems and a somewhat hazy, if not entirely clear, playing field for these issues to be addressed. As such, I don&#39;t really see a NATO expulsion mechanism as being an effective political tool for actually addressing the issues in problematic NATO countries, be it Turkey (or Hungary, for that matter).</p>\n</div>",

In some cases in Afghanistan, we were transporting fuel by helicopter to remote bases for years.  Think about not just the fuel shipped, but the long tail logistics of shipping all that fuel.  The fuel needed for the helicopter.  The fuel needed for shipping spare parts for the helicopter that was busy shipping fuel, etc.  If that FOB had even one or two electric vehicles for routine patrol and some solar and wind, you can cut the people/equipment/money/fuel spent of dealing with logistics for that base.  Over 20 years, that's significant, and worth some tradeoffs.\n\n> In sunny suburbia, people don't need to charge their car in half an hour, it can take all day so you can use fewer solar panels.\n\nIt can take _all night_ as I said.  You charge batteries at the solar panels.  Then the panels can dump into the vehicle at higher speed if you need fast half hour charging.  (Which isn't necessarily something you actually need for stuff like routing daily patrols, which consume a lot of fuel.)\n\nI'm not saying it'll be practical to flip to 100% vehicles in the near term.  Nobody is saying that.  You are fighting a straw man in your argument by trying to only consider a use case where electric might not be a good fit as if that disproves the utility of electric for all use cases.\n\nI am saying in some cases they can be useful and practical.

            "body": "> Wagner financier Yevgeny Prigozhin\u2019s star has begun to set after months of apparent rise following his failure to make good on promises of capturing Bakhmut with his own forces. Russian President Vladimir Putin had likely turned to Prigozhin and Prigozhin\u2019s reported ally, Army General Sergey Surovikin, to continue efforts to gain ground and break the will of Ukraine and its Western backers to continue the war after the conventional Russian military had culminated and, indeed, suffered disastrous setbacks. The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) and General Staff, headed by Sergey Shoigu and Army General Valeriy Gerasimov respectively, had turned their attention to mobilizing Russian reservists and conscripts and setting conditions for improved performance by the conventional Russian military, but they had little hope of achieving anything decisive in the Fall and early Winter of 2022. Putin apparently decided to give Prigozhin and Surovikin a chance to show what they could do with mobilized prisoners, on the one hand, and a brutal air campaign targeting Ukrainian civilian infrastructure on the other. Both efforts failed, as Prigozhin\u2019s attempts to seize Bakhmut culminated and Surovikin\u2019s air campaign accomplished little more than inflicting suffering on Ukrainian civilians while expending most of Russia\u2019s remaining stocks of precision missiles. Prigozhin seems to have decided in this period that his star really was on the ascendant and that he could challenge Gerasimov and even Shoigu for preeminence in Russian military affairs.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>Wagner financier Yevgeny Prigozhin\u2019s star has begun to set after months of apparent rise following his failure to make good on promises of capturing Bakhmut with his own forces. Russian President Vladimir Putin had likely turned to Prigozhin and Prigozhin\u2019s reported ally, Army General Sergey Surovikin, to continue efforts to gain ground and break the will of Ukraine and its Western backers to continue the war after the conventional Russian military had culminated and, indeed, suffered disastrous setbacks. The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) and General Staff, headed by Sergey Shoigu and Army General Valeriy Gerasimov respectively, had turned their attention to mobilizing Russian reservists and conscripts and setting conditions for improved performance by the conventional Russian military, but they had little hope of achieving anything decisive in the Fall and early Winter of 2022. Putin apparently decided to give Prigozhin and Surovikin a chance to show what they could do with mobilized prisoners, on the one hand, and a brutal air campaign targeting Ukrainian civilian infrastructure on the other. Both efforts failed, as Prigozhin\u2019s attempts to seize Bakhmut culminated and Surovikin\u2019s air campaign accomplished little more than inflicting suffering on Ukrainian civilians while expending most of Russia\u2019s remaining stocks of precision missiles. Prigozhin seems to have decided in this period that his star really was on the ascendant and that he could challenge Gerasimov and even Shoigu for preeminence in Russian military affairs. Those hopes now seem to have been delusional.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Either ISW is painfully out of touch, or the recent tenor of <a href=\"/r/credibledefense\">/r/credibledefense</a> posters are.

There are two parties to that trade: you and the bank. What the conversation was about was trades that would happen in a free floating currency, say a USD/EUR pair, between you and I, virtually 24/6. And $10k or $100k are not institutionalized sized trades either. That\u2019s just, to put it gently, misinformed.</p>\n</div>",

Some imports are mission critical but most imports are consumer goods and relayed services. Poor Boris. No new BMW for him. As you might imagine this also sanctions those companies that would sell such goods and services in Russia. This js obviously bad for the economy of the country enforcing such sanctions.\n\nAt the same time Russia is a net exporter of primary goods and commodities.  Such sanctions also forbade companies from buying cheap raw materials. At the same time, non US aligned countries decided it was am excellent idea to buy the Russian glut of exports at a heavy discount, filling up Russian coffers.  Who could blame them? They don't like the US and cheap oil is cheap oil.\n\nAn interesting tid bit is that in order to try and lower energy prices, Biden unsanctiined imports Venezuelan Oil. I guess a the idea is to really fuck with Russia.\n\nThis leaves us with a broad panorama. There are some certain winners here, primarily India and China. Cheap shit galore and give the middle finger to the US at the same time. This also helps keep Russia macroeconomically stable. \n\nNow, where do the sanctions really hurt Russia? They are blacklisted from all investment circles. Let's say I'm Meta and have 2 billion for R&D shit. I am not allowed to do that in Moscow. This obviously hurts Russia. They were also cut off from SWIFT which is the network for transnational payments, so even if they wanted to pay for something , they cannot. And creditors would be in violation of sanctions s if they tried to cash a Russian IOU anyways.  Russia is in a middle of a de facto DebT default where they DO HAVE THE MONEY BUT NOBODY IS WILLING XAN LEGALLY TAKE THE MONEY. The upside is that they are sitting on a massive pile of money. Enough for at least 5 years of all out war. Keep in mind that the Russian Central Bank is run by financial geniuses. They might be Putinists but they are VERY good at their job. Hell, dump J powel and Hire Elvira Nabiulina. That woman js the Messi of Central banking.\n\nSo we're does this leaves us? The US is trying its darnest to keep other nations from Russian markets even if that would be beneficial for the third party. They don't want Russia to be able to finance the War through  international markets and most importantly, The US and Allies have decided that keeping the technological edge is paramount for the next 50 years. That's why Obama tried to pass the TPP, Trump starred the economic war with China and now Biden has outright banned the transfer.of high end tech to both Russia and China.\n\nWe are in a cold war, and Nato is very.close to being in a de facto state of open war with Russia.",

            "body": "There is no such fixing, basically all restrictions for ruble trading are long gone, and even dollar and euro banknotes are widely available nowadays in most banks. Current ruble exchange rate is fluctuating and determined by market, however trade volumes are lower in dollars and euros than before the war. If you are interested in details, here is a brief summary:\n\n\"The ruble has had a very turbulent year, demonstrating a strong increase in volatility in its first and last months. The ruble not only fell at the beginning of the year to historical lows against the dollar and euro, but also managed to update multi-year highs in both pairs in the second half of the year. So, on June 28, the ruble strengthened to 50.01 per dollar for the first time since May 25, 2018, on September 30, the ruble rose to 50.7 per euro for the first time since October 8, 2014. In turn, the dollar and the euro updated their historical highs on March 10, when the US currency rose to 121.5 rubles, and the euro rose to 132.4 rubles.\n\n\nIn general, three periods can be clearly traced in the dynamics of the ruble over the past year. The fall in February-March, which was caused by the beginning of a special military operation (SVO) of the Russian Federation on the territory of Ukraine and retaliatory sanctions from Western countries; the spring-summer increase in the ruble associated with the actions of the Russian authorities to stabilize the situation in the financial sector, strengthening the balance of payments and a significant excess of exports over imports, as well as the transfer of payment for gas in rubles; weakening in November-December due to the introduction of a \"ceiling\" of prices for Russian oil and gas.\n\nNevertheless, at the end of the year, the ruble managed not only to strengthen in both pairs, but also to enter the top three among the major emerging markets (EM) currencies. So, by the end of 2022, the US dollar weakened by 4.8 rubles, or 6.4%, the euro fell by 10.2 rubles, or 12%. At the same time, relative to the Chinese yuan, the US dollar fell by 8.3%, the Brazilian real - by 5.7%, the Mexican peso - by 5.1%.\n\nAs part of the policy of strengthening financial sovereignty and de-dollarization of the Russian economy, the Moscow Exchange in 2022 allowed several new currencies to be traded - the Armenian dram, the South African rand, the Uzbek sum, the Kyrgyz som and the Tajik somoni. Thus, 18 currency pairs, including Chinese yuan, Kazakhstani tenge, Belarusian ruble, Turkish lira, Hong Kong dollar, began to be traded on the exchange's foreign exchange market. The growing popularity of transactions with the currencies of the EAEU countries and the Asian region has been observed since the very beginning of the year: their share in the total volume of spot transactions increased from 0.5% to 25% by the end of October.\n\nIn particular, since the end of February, there has been a significant increase in the volume of transactions with the yuan. According to the results of trading on February 28, the trading volume for the yuan-ruble pair amounted to 1.2 billion rubles, and two weeks later it rose to 12.4 billion rubles. The record for the volume of transactions in the yuan-ruble pair was set at the auction on December 22. Then it amounted to 163.1 billion rubles. On July 22, the yuan overtook the euro for the first time in terms of trading volume at the end of the day on the Moscow Stock Exchange, and already in the middle of the trading session on August 18, the yuan overtook the dollar in this indicator.\n\nAt the same time, since August 8, the Moscow Stock Exchange has suspended trading in the Japanese yen. This was due to potential risks and difficulties in making calculations.\n\nIn general, from January to November 2022, the volume of foreign exchange trading on the Moscow Stock Exchange amounted to 245.8 trillion rubles. This is 15% less than in the same period of 2021 (290.6 trillion rubles).\"\n\nEdit: divided text into paragraphs for readability.",

This forum should *not* become an echo chamber for *either* side. Take Russian telegram, some of the crap that comes out of there is just that. Crap from an alternate dimension where Russia is winning. Some of it is copium. Some of it is good. My first encounter with reports about Soledar falling was from a user posting pro-RU telegram chats. Someone who, BTW, got a user report for pushing an agenda. If I had removed that, it probably would have stifled that story for a day or longer here. And then you have the other commenters who say \u201coh why are the mods censoring news about Soledar!!?!\u201d As far as I can tell, we can either have a complete picture and rapid news aggregation, or we can not do that to only post the \u2018correct\u2019 info. \n\nThird what I think is pro-RU, what someone else thinks is pro-RU, and what our Ukrainian users may think is pro-RU are all different. People will report footage or news because it looks bad for Ukraine. If it\u2019s faked, or mistaken, or somehow inauthentic I would take that down. In fact if you think someone is intentionally altering posts to push a narrative, for example by rewriting the text of an article, you should DM the mods because I *will* ban people for that. But I won\u2019t remove a post just because it shows something bad happened to Ukraine. \n\nUltimately there is a judgement call that needs to be made here, and any option is not a satisfying one. Do you open the conversation up to give a fuller picture, and risk bad actors pushing a narrative or distributing propaganda. Or do you shut the conversation down, risk missing big things, but mostly cut out that propaganda? There are no easy answers and no instant win buttons. I could, as one user suggested, ban one pro-RU account per day. That would certainly rebalance the forum (of course, bans also don\u2019t work when you can just make a new account and post. Something that happens here a *lot* and is the half reason why automod is so fucked). I don\u2019t think that would make the conversation better. I think I\u2019d lead to more nuke anxiety posting and tank posts. \n\nThere is a reason why TOC did all the top line posts and ran the megathread. He was good at this.

That shadow fleet of ~200 ships can only generously carry maybe 30-40% of total seaborne Russian oil. And, ports have a lot of flexibility in deciding which insurance services they accept. The fact that the U.S. has chosen not to clamp down on that is further evidence that they aren\u2019t too keen on decimating Russian production completely. The U.S. is also currently resisting lowering the cap to below $60. \n\nBut, at the end of the day, the point of the cap is to make Russia\u2019s life harder, not to remove their oil from world supply, because that would have a negative impact on Western economies. There\u2019s very little to suggest that the cap isn\u2019t working as it was intended. And this is coming from someone who was vehemently anti-cap and assumed Russian supply would only be negligibly affected. Relying on ancillary services is akin to putting lipstick on a pig. It\u2019s largely missing the point.\n\nWhat\u2019s more important than any of that is what\u2019s going to happen with Russian refined products. The cap and ban of sales into Europe go into effect on Feb 5. And the EU still hasn\u2019t published any guidance on that front. The second order of importance is nat gas prices (both Dutch and Henry Hub.)

The fact that the U.S. has chosen not to clamp down on that is further evidence that they aren\u2019t too keen on decimating Russian production completely. The U.S. is also currently resisting lowering the cap to below $60. </p>\n\n<p>But, at the end of the day, the point of the cap is to make Russia\u2019s life harder, not to remove their oil from world supply, because that would have a negative impact on Western economies. There\u2019s very little to suggest that the cap isn\u2019t working as it was intended. And this is coming from someone who was vehemently anti-cap and assumed Russian supply would only be negligibly affected. Relying on ancillary services is akin to putting lipstick on a pig. It\u2019s largely missing the point.</p>\n\n<p>What\u2019s more important than any of that is what\u2019s going to happen with Russian refined products. The cap and ban of sales into Europe go into effect on Feb 5. And the EU still hasn\u2019t published any guidance on that front. The second order of importance is nat gas prices (both Dutch and Henry Hub.) That\u2019s where Russia is really suffering, because not only does it have no active ability to influence prices on that front, volumes are also down to (basically) zero.</p>\n</div>",

But whose oil exactly will be loaded in Tallinn the other day with a huge 160-thousand\u2014ton Spirit, which arrived from Brazil, is, of course, a rhetorical question. By the way, multi-day observations show that some tankers indicating Tallinn as their place of arrival, after standing there for a day or two, then go to Primorsk or Ust-Luga for loading, as happened the other day with CE HAMILTON (158 thousand tons) from India. Or with SEASONG (105 thousand tons) under the Maltese flag, which went-went from Italian Milazzo to Tallinn, and then suddenly ended up in Vysotsk.

Even if they on average only last 3 days, they do serious damage. </p>\n\n<p>I think maybe switchblade 600s would help to replace them somewhat, but it seems those still have not been mass produced. I&#39;m also not sure how feasible it is to use 300s for isr</p>\n</div>",
