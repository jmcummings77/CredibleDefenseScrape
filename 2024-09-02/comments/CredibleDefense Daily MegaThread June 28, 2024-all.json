It\u2019s a small, non-stealthy but somewhat medium range missile that can be used in the AShW role and 8 of them can fit inside the internal bays of an F-35B and with there still being enough room for 2 Meteors.\n\nIt\u2019s not expected to have a very large warhead but it should have the capability to independently target specific areas of a ship, such as its VLS cells or the bridge or the ship\u2019s radar which could essentially ensure a mission-kill if the missile gets through. While I highly doubt a sub-sonic and non-stealthy cruise missile is going to be able to get through the layered defences of any modern carrier group, maybe it doesn\u2019t have to.\n\nDue to the proprieties of SPEAR-3 and the potential for it to mission-kill extremely important platforms, carrier groups *will* need to respond to these missiles in some way, likely by expending limited interceptor missiles. But given that 8 of these missiles can fit in just a single F-35B and given that a British carrier can carry around 36 F-35Bs, even just 24 F-35Bs equipped with SPEAR-3s would be 192 missiles that enemy carrier groups will need to expend missiles on and given the penchant to double tap on interceptors per target, we\u2019re looking at an absolute minimum of 200 or so interceptors being used up and likely upwards of 300.\n\n300 interceptors being used up on tiny AShMs is extremely significant as that\u2019ll likely be approaching the absolute limit of what most carrier groups are likely to have in interceptor stocks at any given time so if the remaining F-35Bs or ships have beefier AShMs in stock, such as FC/ASW, the chances these can get past solely on just the enemy\u2019s interceptor stocks having been run down increases dramatically.\n\nSo, I guess I just wonder how credible this tactic is and what the answer would realistically be here. DEW maybe? If these ever become a viable thing?\n\nThe Royal Navy for a long time has had very little credible AShW capabilities outside of their SSNs but with the addition of SPEAR-3 and later on FC/ASW being both VLS launched and air-dropped, how effective and how much of a boost would a combination attack of these two missiles be?",

The authors examine both right-wing and left-wing terror threats, but do not consider the threat posed by separatism. \n\n**Jihadism**\n\n>Jihadi terrorism represents, by a significant margin, the biggest threat to the Paris Olympics and remains the biggest threat in Europe writ large.\n\nSome highlights from this section include\n\n>More recently, in March 2024 two Afghans linked to ISK were arrested in Germany for plotting to attack police and crowds outside the Swedish parliament to avenge Qur\u2019an burnings by anti-Islam activists in Sweden. The plot was reportedly an example of ISK employing a cyber-coach approach to enabling terrorism, which has become the group\u2019s signature. According to German prosecutors, after having been tasked by ISK to carry out an attack, \u201cthe two made concrete preparations in close consultation with ISK operatives.\u201d According to a French security source, cyber-coaching is the right term to describe the ISK modus operandi. The source says the group\u2019s cyber-coaches act as a human resources hub that can connect different elements to conduct an attack. At the same time, according to the source, this can make it easier to foil plots since each hub tends to engage with many individuals and more than one plot.\n\nThis coordination function provided by remote Islamic State members is a significant enabler for terrorist attackers. It has the power to generate local cells from previously disconnected individuals allowing for more complex and deadlier attacks. IS remote handlers can also provide morale support at critical moments prior to and during an attack, preventing would-be terrorists from backing out of their plans. \n\nThis work-from-home approach to terrorism is not limited to ISK either\n\n>In late May 2024, French security foiled another alleged plot by an 18-year-old man, also of Chechen origin, to launch a suicide attack against spectators and police during one of the upcoming Olympic soccer matches at Geoffroy-Guichard stadium in Saint-\u00c9tienne. Le Parisien newspaper reported that he was in contact with ISK operatives and plotted the attack in liaison with them, with his conspiratorial communications taking place over Telegram. However, according to a French security source, investigations have revealed that the operatives communicating with the Saint-\u00c9tienne plotter were Chechen Islamic State jihadis in Syria rather than belonging to ISK.\n\nThe proliferation of this technique demonstrates how tactics proliferate across IS branches and the value of the more centralized control that IS maintains. \n\n**Violent Activism**\n\n>A potential violent threat to the Paris 2024 Olympics is political activism getting out of hand causing violence or ultimately terrorist incidents. The risk is low compared to the jihadi terror threat but cannot be ruled out. Pro-Palestinian protests have been intensifying across Western Europe since Israel launched its war against Hamas in Gaza, killing a high number of civilians.\n\nThis section is mostly theoretical as the protests against the Israeli campaign in Gaza have been largely peaceful outside of a handful of molotov cocktail incidents although the authors note that there are historical examples of frustrated activists turning to violence either spontaneously or via recruitment by external groups. \n\nNon-Gaza related sources of potential violence\n\n>While left-wing terrorists could see opportunities at the Paris Olympics to target symbols of capitalism, Americanism, environmental degradation, or Israeli actions in Gaza, there is no shortage of such symbols at any given time, and violent left-wing actors do not currently display the intent or capacity for spectacular attacks.\n\nand \n\n> As Paris prepares to host the Olympics, there are active transnational extreme-right networks aiming to weaken European democracies, spread chaos, polarize and draw attention to specific movements, causes, and grievances. At the same time, the right-wing terror threat is limited compared to that posed by jihadi actors and lacks the latter\u2019s capabilities and strategic depth gained from mother organizations in conflict zones.\n\n**Russia and Proxies**\n\n>According to sources in European security agencies, cited by the Financial Times, Russia has significantly increased influence operations and espionage especially in former Eastern Bloc states but also in Western European countries with limited counterespionage capacity. The FT\u2019s sources warned that Russia was plotting violent acts of sabotage, including bombings, arson attacks, and destruction of infrastructure, all over Europe \u201cdirectly and via proxies.\u201d\n\nThe Russian sabotage campaign in Europe has been documented fairly extensively elsewhere as have Russian influence campaigns seeking to influence and undermine European democratic institutions. Another component of those campaigns is the radicalization of far-right groups in Europe and the linkage between those groups and paramilitary groups within Russia that are willing to train and equip European counterparts. New information indicates that Russia is even willing to move beyond proxies and act directly\n\n>While influence operations and sabotage are the most likely threats associated with Russia, support for non-state terrorist networks cannot be ruled out. On June 5, 2024, French media reported that the domestic security services had arrested near Charles de Gaulle airport a 26-year-old Ukrainian-Russian from the Russia-occupied Donbass region who accidently set off an explosive in his hotel room while preparing a bomb suitable for a terror attack. According to a French security source, investigations clearly indicate a Russian operation, with it not being excluded that the plan was to carry out a false flag attack to pin the blame on jihadis given the explosive was of the type often associated with jihadis.\n\nWhile Russia has already shown itself to not by shy about conducting assassinations in Europe, direct attacks by the Russian state on purely civilian targets in Europe would be a significant escalation. \n\n**Iran and Proxies**\n\nIran seems largely content to attack Israelis directly although with little to no distinction made in terms of target selection. \n\n> Iranian intelligence operatives acting as diplomats have been tied to numerous assassinations or plots to assassinate dissident exiles and plans to attack Israeli targets, including a plot to attack an embassy and kindergarten in Germany also in 2018.\n\nIn terms of wider implications\n>As for larger attacks during high-profile events such as the Paris Olympics, Tehran likely knows any attacks linked to the Iran threat network would crush what remain of Iran-E.U. relations and could decrease European sympathy for Palestinians and increase European sympathy for Israel. \n\nLooking forward\n>If there is a major escalation of the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah this summer ahead of or during the Olympics, one concern is that it may change Hezbollah\u2019s calculus when it comes to launching terrorist attacks in Europe, especially against Israeli or Jewish targets.\n\nUltimately my interpretation of this report is that the Islamic State presents the most likely danger to Europe and the Paris games specifically, presenting a remarkably array of threats, varied in both source and magnitude with the greatest danger arising from coordination between these different vectors. The wildcard in the situation appears to be Russia. I don't consider the likelihood of Russian false-flag operations to be high as the potential blowback on Russia could be astronomical but the fact that the possibility is even under consideration is highly notable.",

He went to the actual airfield and conducted interviews himself about it. \n\n\n> Russia\u2019s operational plan called for a rapid air assault into Hostomel Airport, while mechanized forces would concurrently advance on Kyiv from Belarus, on the western side of the Dnipro River, and from Russia, on the river\u2019s eastern side. \n\n\u2026\n\n> Russia\u2019s assault force consisted of approximately 34 helicopters and 200 to 300 Russian airborne soldiers from the 31st Guards Air Assault Brigade and 45th Separate Guards Spetsnaz Brigade. \n\n> Thus, on the morning of the attack, approximately 200 soldiers from the Ukrainian National Guard\u2019s 4th Rapid Reaction Brigade were left to defend the airport.\n\n\u2026\n\n> After being spotted, Ukrainian anti-aircraft missiles downed two of the lead helicopters near the dam. A damaged Ka-52 crash-landed near the river\u2019s shore while a destroyed Mi-24 crashed into the river. \n\n> Around 11 a.m., the attack formation neared Hostomel airport. As they approached, the attack helicopters broke to the north \u2014 to engage targets on the airfield \u2014 and the transport helicopters broke to the south \u2014 planning to land and secure the airfield\u2019s barracks and facilities. \n\n> It did not take long for the National Guard conscripts to make their presence known. As one of the KA-52 Alligators was making a strafing run, a soldier attempted to engage it with his 9k38 Igla (SA-24) infrared-homing surface-to-air missile system, but the Russian helicopter was too close. As it passed, he reacquired the attack helicopter in his sights and fired. The direct hit brought the helicopter careening onto the runway, fortuitously creating another obstacle. \n\n>This successful engagement provided a morale boost that quickly spread across the Ukrainian fighters. The rear echelon conscripts started to believe that they could actually succeed in fighting the Russians. It was the first, but not the last, helicopter that these soldiers would bring down. Over the next two hours, the National Guard defenders appear to have downed two more KA-52s and one Mi-8s using a mix of man-portable air defenses, anti-aircraft guns, and small arms fire. \n\n> Despite the resistance, the Russians eventually inserted the roughly 300 airborne soldiers onto the airfield in two waves of 10 helicopters each. \n\n> The second set of Russian reinforcements were the mechanized and armor forces that were advancing toward Kyiv from Belarus on the west side of the Dnipro River. After the initial Russian mechanized forces crossed the Ukrainian border at 4 a.m. on the morning of February 24, they only had to drive 79 miles by road to reach Kyiv. The Russian plan likely assumed that either the transport planes or mechanized forces would reach the airport by late afternoon, but neither was the case. The advancing mechanized forces were encountering their own difficulties while fighting along the narrow corridor through Chernobyl and Ivankiv, meaning the Russian Airborne forces would be on their own through the first night. \n\n\u2026\n\n> Shortly before sunset, the Ukrainian counterattack started with strikes from artillery and Su-24 bombers to soften the Russian defenses. As the ground assault commenced, some of the Ukrainian soldiers noted that the Russian airborne soldiers failed to occupy good defensive positions and found it fairly easy to dislodge them. One Ukrainian soldier described engaging the minimally protected Russian forces on the airfield as being like \u201cplaying a video game, just shooting and knocking them down from our positions outside the airfield.\u201d \n\n> Before the night was through, Ukrainian soldiers claimed to have retaken the airfield after killing many of the airborne soldiers; the remainder having retreated into the woods to the airfield\u2019s west. By 9 p.m., the 4th Rapid Reaction Brigade posted an image on their Facebook page of soldiers celebrating the victory, but their stay on the airfield would also be short-lived. The Ukrainians knew that the Russian mechanized forces were closing in from the north and that they lacked the combat power to hold the airfield, so they withdrew. But as they were withdrawing, the Ukrainians used artillery and aerial bombardments to crater the runway to make it unusable as an airbridge for Russia\u2019s invasion.\n\n\u2026\n\n> The battle of Hostomel was arguably the most critical battle of the Russo-Ukrainian war to date. Although the Ukrainian military was unable to maintain control of the airfield, the National Guard conscripts delayed the assault long enough to prevent Russia from immediately using Hostomel airport as an airbridge. Ukrainian forces north of the city also delayed the mechanized battalions advancing south from Belarus long enough to create a window for Ukrainian forces to counterattack and deliberately crater Hostomel\u2019s runway enough to make it unusable. \n\n>The failure at Hostomel was compounded by the slowness of the Russian advance from Belarus, which forced the Russian troops to attempt to seize the capital without the element of surprise, days behind schedule.",

One Ukrainian soldier described engaging the minimally protected Russian forces on the airfield as being like \u201cplaying a video game, just shooting and knocking them down from our positions outside the airfield.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>Before the night was through, Ukrainian soldiers claimed to have retaken the airfield after killing many of the airborne soldiers; the remainder having retreated into the woods to the airfield\u2019s west. By 9 p.m., the 4th Rapid Reaction Brigade posted an image on their Facebook page of soldiers celebrating the victory, but their stay on the airfield would also be short-lived. The Ukrainians knew that the Russian mechanized forces were closing in from the north and that they lacked the combat power to hold the airfield, so they withdrew. But as they were withdrawing, the Ukrainians used artillery and aerial bombardments to crater the runway to make it unusable as an airbridge for Russia\u2019s invasion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\u2026</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The battle of Hostomel was arguably the most critical battle of the Russo-Ukrainian war to date. Although the Ukrainian military was unable to maintain control of the airfield, the National Guard conscripts delayed the assault long enough to prevent Russia from immediately using Hostomel airport as an airbridge. Ukrainian forces north of the city also delayed the mechanized battalions advancing south from Belarus long enough to create a window for Ukrainian forces to counterattack and deliberately crater Hostomel\u2019s runway enough to make it unusable. </p>\n\n<p>The failure at Hostomel was compounded by the slowness of the Russian advance from Belarus, which forced the Russian troops to attempt to seize the capital without the element of surprise, days behind schedule.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

This aid bill passing has extended the Ukrainian ability to fight for years and lead to things like ATACMS being provided, which wasn&#39;t possible until this bill released more money for aid. Lobbying is a personalized thing, and strong enough efforts can get you progress even from ideological enemies if you play the angle the right way. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/david-lammy-shows-yen-trump-whisperer-us-visit-xmpxhvg58\">https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/david-lammy-shows-yen-trump-whisperer-us-visit-xmpxhvg58</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://archive.ph/tXu5Q\">https://archive.ph/tXu5Q</a></p>\n</div>",
