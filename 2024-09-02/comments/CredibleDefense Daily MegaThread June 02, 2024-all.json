The DA, which stands for sensible, liberal economics, has a proven record of governing well in places where it has a majority. In Cape Town services largely work, roads are maintained and residents are shielded from the worst of the regular power cuts imposed on the rest of the country. The Western Cape province has a lower unemployment rate than anc-controlled provinces. Yet because the DA is widely perceived as a \u201cwhite\u201d party in a country with a black majority, it has struggled to translate good governance into votes.

China would do something similar, but the US has contingency plans for that.\n\nAt about the same time, I imagine that the US would strike high value radars up and down China's coasts using stealth bombers and extended range stealth missiles.\n\nI do not know precisely what facilities and installations must be targeted to best disrupt the kill chain of China's anti-ship missile systems... but I imagine the US military does indeed know about those installations. Those installations, would be targeted.\n\nOnce China's ability to find the carriers has been dramatically reduced the carriers would move forward. If the United States is particularly confident in its missile defenses, they might move forward very quickly. I recently watched a video on a test of a US destroyer's defenses. To counter a mock hypersonic threat, one missile was launched from a burke. To counter a sea skimming threat - two were launched.\n\nThis is speculation on my part, but to me... that says that the US is far more confident in its ability to intercept hypersonics than its ability to intercept missiles flying very close to the ocean's surface - which would explain why the US has stuck with - and continues to stick to - sea skimming missiles.

The assumptions made in that report were that ship based missile defenses are extremely good, and so the value that China gets out of those platforms according to the report are in its ability to produce a large volley at distance rather than the danger of a small group of hypersonic rogue warheads causing damage to a ship.\n\nIts worth noting, that the US has recently developed the ability to quad pack VLS cells with Patriot missiles. If Patriots are deemed effective enough counters to China's missile volleys, well... that greatly increases the magazine depth of US carrier strike groups.\n\nThe US has something like 5,000 JASSM missiles that it can use to break China's A2AD capabilities before it really needs to get close to China. That is a lot of extremely effective stealth cruise missiles. If a war were to break out, the US would be able to break China's kill chain, and stop China from being able to relay real time data between observers and its missile platforms. Those fancy missiles are only a threat if they have real time targeting data.\n\nI think that China would be better off if it had stealth bombers and long range stealth sea skimming cruise missiles of its own rather than hyper-sonic glide vehicles.

You've said nothing to address my previous comment. You brought up hypothetical Chinese threats to go nuclear in the event we get into a direct conflict, and compared it to the cold war. That comparison doesn't hold water because we never got into a shooting war with the USSR. Nuclear threats during wartime with a nuclear power would be genuinely new.\n\nWe're not \"used to\" that, and I don't think we can confidently predict how the American public would respond.

It looks like the US is pushing the Israelis quite heavily on this and Hamas appears ready to accept if Netanyahu is willing - although that is certainly not clear given the fragile dynamics of his cabinet. \n\nMy thoughts: It seems increasingly clear Israel's campaign in Gaza will be a failure. The stated objectives were very clear: freeing all the hostages and ending Hamas's ability to govern the Gaza strip and posses a coherent armed force. \n\nIsrael has managed to free only three hostages unliterally, while also killing three (and likely many more) unintentionally. It just doesn't seem feasible they will be able to return many more hostages alive outside of a negotiated settlement with Hamas, and even then as far as I'm aware it's not exactly clear that Hamas is the only group holding hostages, and what kind of conditions (if any) other hostage holding factions would require to release their captives. \n\nOn point two, Hamas, while clearly degraded, still exists as not only both a governing and military entity in Gaza, but as *the* governing and military entity in Gaza. On this objective the Israeli gov has absolutely shot itself in the foot to the extent they have proposed no plan for alternative government in Gaza, whether Palestinian, foreign, or Israeli in nature. Unless Netanyahu was not serious about point two or genuinely believed Hamas could be bombed into non-existence over a few months and not somehow re-constitute itself or re-emerge under a different name later, it seems obvious the objective was never going to be achieved. \n\nI would bet Netanyahu does take the deal on offer right now, so he can walk away with at least one of his war aims. Otherwise the only remaining move would really be to re-occupy the strip - which aside from being a huge economic drain on Israel would be a death sentence for the remaining hostages, guarantee many more years of a low-intensity war in the strip, and I presume most crucially, lead to some real consequences from the US in terms of aid/diplomatic backing.\n\nAssuming he does take the deal, I don't see how this conflict isn't a Hamas victory. They pulled off the deadliest strike on Israel in its history and get to remain in power to plot for another day - a complete return to the *status quo ante bellum* with Israel having nothing to show for it.",

Iran, then, was a shadow of what it is now. Iraq presented the greatest threat to Israeli interests. It's well recognized that Israel and the Israel lobby in the US played a major role in rallying support for the war. See here: https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2010/02/iraq-war-israel-bush-saddam\n\n\"Pressure from Israel and the Lobby was not the only factor behind the decision to attack Iraq in March 2003, but it was critical. Some Americans believe that this was a war for oil, but there is hardly any direct evidence to support this claim. Instead, the war was motivated in good part by a desire to make Israel more secure. According to Philip Zelikow, a former member of the president\u2019s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, the executive director of the 9/11 Commission, and now a counsellor to Condoleezza Rice, the \u201creal threat\u201d from Iraq was not a threat to the United States.\n\nThe \u201cunstated threat\u201d was the \u201cthreat against Israel\u201d, Zelikow told an audience at the University of Virginia in September 2002. \u201cThe American government,\u201d he added, \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to lean too hard on it rhetorically, because it is not a popular sell.\u201d\"\n\n>The Jewish lobby and Jewish cunning? You're leaning into the antisemitic stereotypes here.\n\nThis is not credible discussion and, frankly, shouldn't be allowed on this sub. Acknowledging the existence of AIPAC is not, and has never been, antisemitic. Israel has always had a reputation for top-notch diplomacy and lobbying - it's what initially secured its existence and made it what it is today - acknowledging that fact is not antisemitic and it's tiresome that any discussion on this subject devolves into that accusation.\n\n>Seems to me that became intolerable when Hamas took over Gaza and launched a bunch of wars on Israel, the most destructive of them being the current one.

In fact, Israel was privately telling the US to go to war with Iran not Iraq.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It is very true. Iran, then, was a shadow of what it is now. Iraq presented the greatest threat to Israeli interests. It&#39;s well recognized that Israel and the Israel lobby in the US played a major role in rallying support for the war. See here: <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2010/02/iraq-war-israel-bush-saddam\">https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2010/02/iraq-war-israel-bush-saddam</a></p>\n\n<p>&quot;Pressure from Israel and the Lobby was not the only factor behind the decision to attack Iraq in March 2003, but it was critical. Some Americans believe that this was a war for oil, but there is hardly any direct evidence to support this claim. Instead, the war was motivated in good part by a desire to make Israel more secure. According to Philip Zelikow, a former member of the president\u2019s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, the executive director of the 9/11 Commission, and now a counsellor to Condoleezza Rice, the \u201creal threat\u201d from Iraq was not a threat to the United States.</p>\n\n<p>The \u201cunstated threat\u201d was the \u201cthreat against Israel\u201d, Zelikow told an audience at the University of Virginia in September 2002. \u201cThe American government,\u201d he added, \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to lean too hard on it rhetorically, because it is not a popular sell.\u201d&quot;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Jewish lobby and Jewish cunning? You&#39;re leaning into the antisemitic stereotypes here.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is not credible discussion and, frankly, shouldn&#39;t be allowed on this sub. Acknowledging the existence of AIPAC is not, and has never been, antisemitic. Israel has always had a reputation for top-notch diplomacy and lobbying - it&#39;s what initially secured its existence and made it what it is today - acknowledging that fact is not antisemitic and it&#39;s tiresome that any discussion on this subject devolves into that accusation.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Seems to me that became intolerable when Hamas took over Gaza and launched a bunch of wars on Israel, the most destructive of them being the current one. Before that, the death toll in the conflict was drastically lower.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes, and the existence of Hamas and groups like it is a direct result of the I/P issue remaining unresolved for more than a century. Focusing on the latest outbreak of violence is quite a one-dimensional way of discussing the issue when policymakers across the West have spent decades trying to wrangle with it.</p>\n</div>",

From a military perspective only \u2014 as President Biden said \u2014 the Israelis have accomplished most of their goals in Gaza,\u201d Kirby asserts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/white-house-official-says-israel-has-accomplished-most-military-goals-in-gaza/\">https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/white-house-official-says-israel-has-accomplished-most-military-goals-in-gaza/</a></p>\n\n<p>Just 14 days ago the United States had a completely different assessment:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Although Hamas\u2019 communications and military abilities have been degraded, only 30 to 35 percent of its fighters \u2014 those who were a part of Hamas before the Oct. 7 attack \u2014 have been killed and about 65 percent of its tunnels are still intact, U.S. intelligence indicates.</p>\n\n<p>Biden officials have also become increasingly concerned that Hamas has been able to recruit during wartime \u2014 thousands over the last several months. That has allowed the group to withstand months of Israeli offensives, according to a person familiar with U.S. intelligence.</p>\n\n<p>The upshot is that Hamas still holds ground and maintains significant capabilities, even after Israel\u2019s all-out war over nearly eight months.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/21/biden-admin-hammering-israel-military-strategy-gaza-00159262\">https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/21/biden-admin-hammering-israel-military-strategy-gaza-00159262</a></p>\n\n<p>So just two weeks ago Hamas retained significant capabilities but now Israel has achieved its military goals? This seems to be a desperate attempt to sell a ceasefire deal by ignoring the facts on the ground.</p>\n</div>",
