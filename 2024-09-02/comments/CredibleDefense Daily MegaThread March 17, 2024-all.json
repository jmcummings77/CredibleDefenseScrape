It is also the first time that the pirates will be taken into custody and brought to India for trials. \n\n[Indian navy recaptures Somali pirate ship and frees crew](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/17/india-recaptures-somali-pirate-ship-and-frees-crew)\n\nIndia\u2019s navy said it recaptured a ship from Somali pirates off the Indian coast on Saturday, rescuing the crew and ending a three-month takeover of the bulk carrier MV Ruen.\n\nThe hijacking in December 2023 was the first time since 2017 any cargo vessel had been successfully boarded by Somali pirates.\n\nThe Indian warship Kolkata \u201cin the last 40 hours, through concerted actions successfully cornered and coerced all 35 Pirates to surrender and ensured safe evacuation of 17 crew members\u201d, the navy said.\n\nIndian forces first intercepted the MV Ruen on Friday, the navy said. \u201cThe vessel opened fire on the warship, which is taking actions [in accordance with] international law, in self-defence and to counter piracy, with minimal force necessary to neutralise the pirates\u2019 threat to shipping and seafarers.\u201d\n\nNone of the rescued crew members were injured in the operation, carried out by several naval vessels along with helicopters and other aircraft, the navy said.\n\nBulgarian owner Navibulgar hailed the Ruen\u2019s release as \u201ca major success not only for us, but for the entire global maritime community \u2026 The resolution of this case proves that the security of commercial shipping will not be compromised.\u201d\n\nBulgaria\u2019s foreign ministry said it was seeking the \u201cspeedy return\u201d of seven rescued nationals.

            "body": "According to the numbers I could find, [Syrzan processed 170,000 barrels of oil per day](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukrainian-drones-hit-russias-syzran-oil-refinery-regional-governor-says-2024-03-16/), compared to Russia's total [pre-war capacity of 6.8 million bbl/day](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1080101/russia-oil-refining-depth/). So 2.5% of their total refining capacity. Which is substantial on its own, but is especially so when taken in consideration with the other strikes, which have affected [refineries responsible for as much as 25% of Russia's total capacity, with a further 25% in range of subsequent Ukrainian drone attacks](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/13/oil-prices-rise-as-us-inventories-fall-ukraine-strikes-russian-refineries.html).\n\nIn economic terms, this is a [\"supply shock.\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_shock) And oil supply shocks are particularly nasty because there are few available substitutes and refined petroleum products are an input to literally every single other industry. Because consumers can't fill their gas tanks with anything else, demand is inelastic, which means even large price increases drive down demand slowly, and a supply shock can drive prices extremely high as a result. Suddenly removing 25% of the supply of refined petroleum products available to the market will immediately drive prices up, and much faster than consumers can modify their behavior to adapt efficiently. It is frequently forgotten in all the noise around failures in the banking, lending, and housing industries, but the Global Financial Crisis was initially sparked by a sudden increase in oil prices during the summer of 2008. The resulting supply shock tipped many marginal borrowers into insolvency all at the same time as they struggled to fill up their gas tanks while still paying their mortgages, which in turn overwhelmed the capacity of lenders to absorb the losses, triggering the collapse of multiple large financial institutions. The nature of a supply shock is that it occurs over a shorter period of time than an economy can effectively adapt, which pushes any consumers who are only marginally solvent into insolvency. It is therefore not unreasonable to anticipate widespread economic difficulties in Russia.\n\nNo amount of financial shenanigans by Russia's central bank nor fiscal policies adopted by the federal and local governments can make more petroleum available to consumers, so they won't be able to paper over any shortages the way they have with sanctions. If everyone with a vehicle needs to bid against everyone else with a vehicle for a limited and shrinking supply of gas, then prices will inevitably go up, which will drive price increases across all other industries. Any stimulative fiscal or central banking policy will only add to the inflation, because then there are more rubles available to compete for gasoline while the supply of gasoline remains fixed or decreasing. Only large scale, multi-year investments to improve capacity in regions out of the range of Ukrainian drones can possibly address the problem, but those investments won't even yield any returns until years from now, when the war may be over or at least the tactical situation will have shifted enough that planning infrastructure investments around it makes little sense. And in the mean time, the Russian economy will suffer. \n\nThe Russians may be able to import refined petroleum products to offset the lost refining capacity, but that seems politically difficult and practically impossible. The infrastructure to import at scale does not exist and will take many months to establish, and only a relatively limited number of countries with significant refinery capacity are willing to trade with Russia. Really only India and China may have the necessary capacity and the willingness to trade. However, they may not want to incur the resulting increase in domestic gas prices from diverting some of the fixed refining capacity available to them to Russia. They are willing to take Russian crude because it comes cheap and drives down gas prices at home. Exporting gas would have the opposite effect. Increasing their own refining capacity on a temporary basis to support Russia would require investment in infrastructure when there is no long term guarantee that Russian demand would persist, and would suffer from the same time lag that investments increasing Russia's own capacity would. It's also not clear that the ships are available to carry those products to Russian ports and pipelines take an enormous amount of time to build, and only China is a candidate for new pipelines to Russia. Even taking the necessary steps to increase imports would require the Russian government admit to an extremely embarrassing situation, which demonstrates the weakness of their Integrated Air Defense Systems, undermining their projected image of strength and whatever little demand for their military exports may remain.\n\nSo Russia now faces multiple dilemmas. In the near term, they need to defend their oil refineries or they will be facing a straight up economic collapse. In the longer term, they need to maintain the viability of their new autarky to resist sanctions, to sustain the civilian economy, and to support increased military production while sustaining the intensity of their efforts in Ukraine. Both near and long term challenges represent dilemmas because the Russians apparently do not have sufficient air defense assets to protect all of their refineries and everything else that might be a legitimate target for Ukraine to attack, and thus must choose which indispensable assets to leave exposed to drone strikes.\n\nNotably, it may not take all 50% of the theoretically reachable refineries to cause a collapse. Oil supply shocks have a way of revealing unrelated fragility in an economy. Just as the housing crisis in the US had no direct, obvious relation to oil prices, but the weakness in the subprime lending category was revealed when borrowers faced budget constraints caused by gas prices. It can be difficult to predict where the economic pain of a gas supply shock will trigger crisis, but if there are any hidden weaknesses in the Russian economy, a shock of this magnitude will reveal them. And given *vranyo*, it seems almost inevitable that there are issues lurking beneath the surface, since papering over major issues to manage political optics is practically a universal feature of Russian culture. Many of the Russian government's efforts to fund the war have involved shifting the burden onto local and regional governments, whose budgets have become enormously strained. Moreover, the refineries themselves are a major source of tax revenue for the federal government. I suspect it will not take much additional strain to push the local and regional governments into insolvency, especially if the federal government cannot afford to shore them up for any non-trivial length of time. In any case, the threat of such extreme economic consequences practically requires the Russians to improve their air defense around refineries.\n\nWhich raises the obvious question, why haven't they done so already after almost a year of ongoing drone attacks targeting refineries? Or why not just even over the past three months as the refinery campaign has intensified? I think we can infer the existence of a dilemma from the Russians' inaction here. The level of incompetence it would take to just forget to defend these critical installations exceeds even what the Russians tolerate from their generals. So the Russians must be facing difficult decisions about where to prioritize placing their air defense assets. Any steps they take to protect the refineries will involve re-allocating air defense from some other category of critical asset. That could mean compromising the defense of logistics nodes, military factories, or even the front line itself. The loss of any of those items could pose a much more immediate problem for the war effort than the lost refining capacity. They may even be protecting only some minimum percentage of their refining capacity which they judge to be sufficient to sustain their wartime economy and military, and are just writing off any other losses as the price of doing business. Whatever that amount is, it is less than what is required for the Russian economy to thrive, so they are paying a real price even if they judge it to be tolerable compared to other options.\n\nIf that is indeed their strategy, it is a remarkably stupid one. For two main reasons. First, because it is impossible to predict how much of a reduction in supply will trigger a broader crisis. Second, because of the uniquely important role that petroleum plays in any modern economy and in any modern military, so losing any buffer capacity they may have above their minimum tolerable level makes the remaining refineries that much more critical to defend and that much more likely to attract novel attacks capable of bypassing the existing defenses. Failing to defend the buffer capacity is failing to establish a layered defense.\n\nThe only way to make such a strategy make sense is if the Russians are prioritizing defending things which are more valuable than their refineries. As in, items which if lost would cause them to lose the war faster than losing 25% of their refining capacity will. But, given the uniquely important role of petroleum, what could that possibly be? Perhaps the Kerch Bridge?",
            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>According to the numbers I could find, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukrainian-drones-hit-russias-syzran-oil-refinery-regional-governor-says-2024-03-16/\">Syrzan processed 170,000 barrels of oil per day</a>, compared to Russia&#39;s total <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1080101/russia-oil-refining-depth/\">pre-war capacity of 6.8 million bbl/day</a>. So 2.5% of their total refining capacity. Which is substantial on its own, but is especially so when taken in consideration with the other strikes, which have affected <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/13/oil-prices-rise-as-us-inventories-fall-ukraine-strikes-russian-refineries.html\">refineries responsible for as much as 25% of Russia&#39;s total capacity, with a further 25% in range of subsequent Ukrainian drone attacks</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In economic terms, this is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_shock\">&quot;supply shock.&quot;</a> And oil supply shocks are particularly nasty because there are few available substitutes and refined petroleum products are an input to literally every single other industry. Because consumers can&#39;t fill their gas tanks with anything else, demand is inelastic, which means even large price increases drive down demand slowly, and a supply shock can drive prices extremely high as a result. Suddenly removing 25% of the supply of refined petroleum products available to the market will immediately drive prices up, and much faster than consumers can modify their behavior to adapt efficiently. It is frequently forgotten in all the noise around failures in the banking, lending, and housing industries, but the Global Financial Crisis was initially sparked by a sudden increase in oil prices during the summer of 2008.

It's been a minute since I got to debate the GFC. \n\nThe core claim of yours that I am attempting to refute is this:\n\n>It is frequently forgotten in all the noise around failures in the banking, lending, and housing industries, but the Global Financial Crisis was initially sparked by a sudden increase in oil prices during the summer of 2008. \n\nSo far as I can tell (the link to the paper in your article is broken, so I can only go by the summary), the core claim made by the researchers is that rising energy prices from 2006 to 2008 provided the shock needed to trigger the crisis:\n\n> When oil prices more than doubled between late 2006 and 2008, sending gas prices to $4.15 per gallon, the calculus of suburban living changed, according to the researchers. High commute costs made suburban homes less valuable and mortgages less affordable for low-income homeowners. Some households could no longer meet mortgage obligations and others walked away from mortgage debt that exceeded the deflated market values of their homes.\n\nI will note that your claim and the source's claim differ somewhat; they have a range from 2006-2008, whereas you claimed summer 2008 as a specific trigger. But let's ignore that minor issue.\n\nMy rebuttal to both of these claims is simple: the timing is off. The crisis was **not** \"initially sparked\" by oil/gas prices rising in 2008, or from 2006-2008, because the crisis was actually sparked in 2006 by house price appreciation halting. Specifically:\n\n1. House price appreciation halted in 2006, not 2008. [Case Schiller Home Price Index](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CSUSHPINSA). \n\n2. When house prices stopped appreciating, banks tightened lending standards and the credit markets tightened substantially. With a whopping [80% of subprime house loans being ARM](https://predatorylending.duke.edu/business-analysis/evolution-of-mortgage-lending/subprime-lending/), those with the least means to handle a shock were quite suddenly faced with the need to increase their monthly payments, often substantially. [Contemporary example](https://money.cnn.com/2007/07/09/real_estate/resets_are_coming/index.htm) of paying $955 a month initially, then spiking to $1,331, a 39 percent increase. Or, a $376 monthly payment increase.\n\n3. From January 2006 to Jan 2007, gas prices were volatile, jumping in a range from [$2-$3/gal](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&s=emm_epm0_pte_nus_dpg&f=m). For a standard 14 gallon tank, that would mean you'd be paying $14 more a tank at the high end of the range. For this signal to match that of the interest rate increases, you'd have to fill your tank 26 times a month, during one of the high months! But we're not 2008 yet.\n\n4.  Bear Sterns started to fall apart in July 2007 ([Summary](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/bear-stearns-collapse.asp)) as a result of significant losses in the subprime lending industry earlier in 2007 ([Contemporary Source](https://web.archive.org/web/20070310164527/http://www.businessweek.com/investor/content/mar2007/pi20070307_505304.htm)). By March 2008, it has collapsed entirely.\n\n5. Lehman Brothers attempts to save itself by closing its [subprime business in August 2007](https://web.archive.org/web/20080317171246/http://www.thestreet.com/story/10375812/1/lehman-brothers-amputates-mortgage-arm.html), but it's too late as the company is far to exposed to MBS that can no longer be unloaded on the market.\n\n6. Over 2008 there is indeed a spike in gas prices (see gas prices chart above). But by this time the secondary market in MBS (aka CDOs and all those fun acronyms) has entirely locked up. All those people made famous by the Big Short have already placed their prescient bets. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae get screwed. And we're into the final part of 2008 where I was wondering if capitalism was over. Fun times.\n\nOr, in the immortal words of the [FDIC](https://www.fdic.gov/bank/historical/crisis/chap1.pdf):\n\n> Initial signs of the housing collapse to come emerged in 2006, as the housing market\nexpansion slowed. In the middle of 2005, mortgage rates began to rise and, by the middle\nof 2006, had increased more than 100 basis points. Higher mortgage rates reduced housing\nmarket activity, causing home price growth to slow. After rising at double-digit annual\nrates for 27 consecutive months through early 2006, home prices peaked in mid-2006. The\nhousing market slowdown eliminated the expectation of future investment gains and,\nalong with it, the ability of borrowers to refinance (for without the expectation of rising\nprices, lenders would be unwilling to provide new funds); housing activity slowed even\nfurther. As interest rates rose and house prices began to fall, many homeowners became\nunable to meet mortgage payments on their existing loans or refinance into a new loan,\nand mortgage defaults rose rapidly.\n\nSo, to conclude, I contend that oil/gas prices in 2008 were not a significant contributor to the financial crisis, simply because the GFC had already kicked off a year and a half or more before then. Even if we look back at gas prices during the GFC, we find that their impact on the average subprime borrower was likely an order of magnitude lower than the impact of their ARM changing interest rate, or failing to refinance after the value of their home fell during the bubble bursting. I concede without argument that oil price shocks are significant economic events and definitely correlate with recessions and other crises, stipulating only that in **this particular instance** they were not a significant determining factor relative to structural problems with the credit system that built up in the early 2000s.",

The crisis was <strong>not</strong> &quot;initially sparked&quot; by oil/gas prices rising in 2008, or from 2006-2008, because the crisis was actually sparked in 2006 by house price appreciation halting. Specifically:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>House price appreciation halted in 2006, not 2008. <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CSUSHPINSA\">Case Schiller Home Price Index</a>. </p></li>\n<li><p>When house prices stopped appreciating, banks tightened lending standards and the credit markets tightened substantially. With a whopping <a href=\"https://predatorylending.duke.edu/business-analysis/evolution-of-mortgage-lending/subprime-lending/\">80% of subprime house loans being ARM</a>, those with the least means to handle a shock were quite suddenly faced with the need to increase their monthly payments, often substantially. <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2007/07/09/real_estate/resets_are_coming/index.htm\">Contemporary example</a> of paying $955 a month initially, then spiking to $1,331, a 39 percent increase. Or, a $376 monthly payment increase.</p></li>\n<li><p>From January 2006 to Jan 2007, gas prices were volatile, jumping in a range from <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&amp;s=emm_epm0_pte_nus_dpg&amp;f=m\">$2-$3/gal</a>. For a standard 14 gallon tank, that would mean you&#39;d be paying $14 more a tank at the high end of the range. For this signal to match that of the interest rate increases, you&#39;d have to fill your tank 26 times a month, during one of the high months! But we&#39;re not 2008 yet.</p></li>\n<li><p>Bear Sterns started to fall apart in July 2007 (<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/bear-stearns-collapse.asp\">Summary</a>) as a result of significant losses in the subprime lending industry earlier in 2007 (<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070310164527/http://www.businessweek.com/investor/content/mar2007/pi20070307_505304.htm\">Contemporary Source</a>). By March 2008, it has collapsed entirely.</p></li>\n<li><p>Lehman Brothers attempts to save itself by closing its <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20080317171246/http://www.thestreet.com/story/10375812/1/lehman-brothers-amputates-mortgage-arm.html\">subprime business in August 2007</a>, but it&#39;s too late as the company is far to exposed to MBS that can no longer be unloaded on the market.</p></li>\n<li><p>Over 2008 there is indeed a spike in gas prices (see gas prices chart above). But by this time the secondary market in MBS (aka CDOs and all those fun acronyms) has entirely locked up. All those people made famous by the Big Short have already placed their prescient bets. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae get screwed. And we&#39;re into the final part of 2008 where I was wondering if capitalism was over. Fun times.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Or, in the immortal words of the <a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/bank/historical/crisis/chap1.pdf\">FDIC</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Initial signs of the housing collapse to come emerged in 2006, as the housing market\nexpansion slowed. In the middle of 2005, mortgage rates began to rise and, by the middle\nof 2006, had increased more than 100 basis points. Higher mortgage rates reduced housing\nmarket activity, causing home price growth to slow. After rising at double-digit annual\nrates for 27 consecutive months through early 2006, home prices peaked in mid-2006. The\nhousing market slowdown eliminated the expectation of future investment gains and,\nalong with it, the ability of borrowers to refinance (for without the expectation of rising\nprices, lenders would be unwilling to provide new funds); housing activity slowed even\nfurther. As interest rates rose and house prices began to fall, many homeowners became\nunable to meet mortgage payments on their existing loans or refinance into a new loan,\nand mortgage defaults rose rapidly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, to conclude, I contend that oil/gas prices in 2008 were not a significant contributor to the financial crisis, simply because the GFC had already kicked off a year and a half or more before then. Even if we look back at gas prices during the GFC, we find that their impact on the average subprime borrower was likely an order of magnitude lower than the impact of their ARM changing interest rate, or failing to refinance after the value of their home fell during the bubble bursting. I concede without argument that oil price shocks are significant economic events and definitely correlate with recessions and other crises, stipulating only that in <strong>this particular instance</strong> they were not a significant determining factor relative to structural problems with the credit system that built up in the early 2000s.</p>\n</div>",

Even calling these \"strikes\" feels sensational, literally overblown and hopelessly out of proportion. Maybe stings or what midges do. No one's ever going to bear down, even wear down Russia with that kind of thing and I'm sure Ukraine has no illusions. The Russians are losing **hundreds of thousands of their men** inside Ukraine, and they just don't care! Much less escalate. It can distract, as we see, from a highly precarious frontline situation and could serve prospective recruits as well as Western skeptics with something of a perspective. Or at least provide for diversion amidst the flood of bad news and forebodings. They need men! Wars are started, fought, won and lost with men, not drones. And they need supplies that are dangerously running out. Could it be the very hope for some kind of Russian escalation or overreaction, and a subsequent rekindling of Western support chains, is actually what at least partly drives Kyiv in these attempts? If so, it proves way too predictable. Russia has no reason to escalate because of this, they've assured themselves of a slow burner as they ponderously take village by village. Whose army do you suppose is going to get them back one day? An army of drones?! Russia can wait, ride us all out.

Maybe stings or what midges do. No one&#39;s ever going to bear down, even wear down Russia with that kind of thing and I&#39;m sure Ukraine has no illusions. The Russians are losing <strong>hundreds of thousands of their men</strong> inside Ukraine, and they just don&#39;t care! Much less escalate. It can distract, as we see, from a highly precarious frontline situation and could serve prospective recruits as well as Western skeptics with something of a perspective. Or at least provide for diversion amidst the flood of bad news and forebodings. They need men! Wars are started, fought, won and lost with men, not drones. And they need supplies that are dangerously running out. Could it be the very hope for some kind of Russian escalation or overreaction, and a subsequent rekindling of Western support chains, is actually what at least partly drives Kyiv in these attempts? If so, it proves way too predictable. Russia has no reason to escalate because of this, they&#39;ve assured themselves of a slow burner as they ponderously take village by village. Whose army do you suppose is going to get them back one day? An army of drones?! Russia can wait, ride us all out. It is questions like these that give you however away as much less patient, and thus confirm one of the fundamental deficiencies of the entire contemporary West.</p>\n</div>",

It's not to say losing Niger (if that's what ends up happening) should be shrugged off, but it's actually very possible to overstate it.  In fact, you managed to really overstate it, imho.\n\nI don't think we should outright ignore Africa (especially North Africa) but I think our level of influence in non-North Africa is a natural consequence of us treating it as the least interesting continent.

Pretty static continent, except, of course, for Millei.  Who I&#39;d hardly call anti-US.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Africa</strong> - ok, we might lose our drone base in Niger.  One that hasn&#39;t flown any flights since the coup, since we&#39;re not allowed to offer security assistance to coup govts without waivers.  Bummer.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think any strategy hoping to turn it around is futile and instead efforts should be made to solidify the relationships that can be salvaged</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I&#39;d say maintaining existing relationships is by definition &quot;turning it around&quot;.  It&#39;s not to say losing Niger (if that&#39;s what ends up happening) should be shrugged off, but it&#39;s actually very possible to overstate it.  In fact, you managed to really overstate it, imho.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t think we should outright ignore Africa (especially North Africa) but I think our level of influence in non-North Africa is a natural consequence of us treating it as the least interesting continent.  Much more &quot;get what you paid for&quot; than &quot;our efforts are futile!&quot;.</p>\n</div>",
