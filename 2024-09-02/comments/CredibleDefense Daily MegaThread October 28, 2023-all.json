As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

The whole article is probably worth reading, but the tldr is: bisect the Gaza Strip, cut off fuel to the North, and wait out the terrorists in the tunnels.\n\nThe IDF would allow civilian passage from the north to the south of the Gaza Strip, and allow humanitarian access to the south to encourage everyone to move south. Then, they would wait the terrorists in their tunnels out in the north, for months if they have to, without going deep into Gaza City. Cutting them off from fuel means they will eventually run out of power, and when they do, they can't power ventilators, which means the deeper tunnels will become inoperable.\n\nThe bisection step is not new nor exclusive to this plan. What I've heard crudely called the \"fishtank filter replacement plan\" (bisect and control mid-Gaza, move civilians from north to south, clear north, move civilians from south to north, clear south) also requires it. The IDF has telegraphed that for weeks now with their evacuation campaign of the north. And the bombing is helping: they are forcing Hamas operatives to go underground into the tunnels. The more fighters there are in the tunnels, the more power they need for ventilation, the more fuel they need... And the plan is: when they finally come out of the tunnels, in weeks or months, IDF bombs fall on their heads.\n\nIt seems like a cleaner plan than tunnel clearing, and the obvious benefit is the IDF would not need to expose itself to the worst dangers of urban battle, though whatever force is enforcing the north-south bisection can probably expect to become attractive Hamas targets. Hopefully by the time Hamas runs out of power and air in the tunnels, most of the civilians have gone, so striking northern Gaza will be less costly.\n\nAs for hostages, they will actually add to Hamas's resource burden in a long tunnel siege, and they will have more incentive to trade them off, for either freeing Palestinian prisoners or more likely, a ticket to Qatar for some in the leadership.\n\nOne clear drawback is this would require months of siege. Bibi is already in political hot water; even with the unity war cabinet, staving off calls for resignation during months of siege will put some stress and uncertainty on their operations. International condemnations and calls for a ceasefire will grow stronger, though they may be able to somewhat alleviate that among the few countries they really need support from (US) with better treatment of the southern half of Gaza.",

        "body": "This may sound counterintuitive but I'm interested to hear people's thoughts on it as I am not a terrorism expert. Despite the fact that Israel is responding with massive force, I actually think what has happened so far has been an absolute win for Hamas. Here's why:\n\n1. **Hamas has justified its continued worthiness for Iranian support.** In a single day, with or without Iranian direct planning, Hamas has done more damage to Israel and arguably caused more internal dissension in the West than any Iran-backed group has in the last decade. There is essentially no way Iran will reduce or pull the plug on Hamas-funding in the future given that they are a hot ticket item. If anything, more of the money they funnel towards Palestinian terrorist groups may be directed towards Hamas, which leads to my next point.\n2. **Hamas is going to get a lot more money.** Given how much the recent Israeli response to  Oct 7th has reinvigorated the anti-Israel crowd, there is no way that Arab states who actively support Hamas, namely Iran and Qatar, are going to avoid funneling more money to them. Add to this that private donations and support to charities that directly support Hamas will almost certainly swell, as will the amount of money given to Palestinian charities in general which Hamas can then skim off of or otherwise manipulate to their own ends (that does happen). ([https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/25/hamas-funding-sanctions-treasury.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/25/hamas-funding-sanctions-treasury.html))\n3. **Hamas is dragging Israel into an ill-defined urban hellscape battle that could last for years and has basically no positive outcome for Israel.** Every dead Palestinian civilian is a propaganda victory for Hamas and the more extensive damage Israel causes to Gaza the more damage they do to their (already tenuous) international reputation and public opinion abroad. If Israel goes full crazy and attempts some sort of ethnic cleansing in order to put an end to all of this once and for all, they'll essentially become a pariah state and will doubtless lose significant amounts of Western material support. This is all in addition to the physical casualties and economic drain Israel will suffer in order to maintain a long-standing operation in Gaza, god forbid an attempted genuine occupation. Of course, Hamas will suffer casualties as well, but that leads me to my next point.\n4. **Israel is creating a wellspring of new Hamas recruits.** The more traumatic the Israeli invasion of Gaza is, the easier time Hamas will have recruiting the next generation of low-level militants from among the traumatized Palestinian people. Safe to say that even absent the ground invasion, after the most recent round of bombings Hamas has safely ensured it'll have more recruits going forward. The current Israeli response is essentially playing directly into the Hamas radicalization efforts and general recruitment narrative. ([https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/teaching-terror-how-hamas-radicalizes-palestinian-society](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/teaching-terror-how-hamas-radicalizes-palestinian-society))\n5. **Hamas has reaffirmed its political control over Gaza and the ongoing crisis will allow it to further solidify its grasp.** Prior to these attacks, Gazan public opinion of Hamas was relatively low (see: [https://www.foreignaffairs.com/israel/what-palestinians-really-think-hamas](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/israel/what-palestinians-really-think-hamas)). Many Palestinians were unhappy with Hamas governance and felt that they were doing a poor job of actually running the region. But now, Hamas can very much reassert that the Palestinian people \\*need\\* them to be in charge. \"Look at how Israel treats you, you need to be able to strike back\" or \"When Israeli tanks roll in, who will protect you but us?\" In short, Hamas has asserted that its the top dog organization in Gaza with this latest attack and the more bombs Israel drops, the more it can justify its existence as the most effective form of resistance against the oppressor.  Add to this that Hamas previously used the chaos of 2013-2014 to eliminate political opposition and detractors in Gaza and you can be sure that they're doing the same thing again right now in order to reaffirm their position. ([https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/05/gaza-palestinians-tortured-summarily-killed-by-hamas-forces-during-2014-conflict/](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/05/gaza-palestinians-tortured-summarily-killed-by-hamas-forces-during-2014-conflict/))\n6. **The violent Israeli response has forced Middle Eastern states approaching a rapprochement to back off.** This has happened most prominently with Saudi Arabia but also with Jordan, Turkey, and Egypt. As a result, progress towards a more integrated-in-the-Middle-East Israel has been largely reversed and old hostilities have been brought to the forefront. These divisions will only increase as Israeli military operations go on. Furthermore, the widening of these gulfs will directly contribute to more visibility and support for the Palestinian cause among states like Saudi Arabia that were wavering/not paying attention to Palestinian suffering. This benefits Hamas (see funding/recruitment) and keeps Hamas in the forefront of the minds of Middle Eastern states. They have also ensured that the likelihood of these states supporting an Israel-favoring two-state solution has evaporated. Speaking of which:\n7. **The two-state solution is dead for at least another generation.** Admittedly, this may seem a little counterintuitive given that Hamas, per their 2017 manifesto, explicitly wants the liberation of Palestine and the creation of a separate Palestinian state, but in killing the two-state solution, Hamas has effectively justified its continued existence, removed any necessity to it to enter into complex negotiations for a two-state solution that may result in Hamas concessions, and avoided a future in which it actually has to effectively govern a Palestinian state or perhaps face losses in democratic elections. Given the aforementioned fact that Hamas as an actual political leadership organization was unpopular prior to this, the fact that the two-state solution is dead essentially guarantees their continued political dominance free from recriminations.\n8. **Hamas has 200+ hostages to use in negotiations.** Not a lot of analysis needed here, the benefit for Hamas is self-evident. Even if Israel may be willing to do the whole \"Samson Doctrine\"/\"they're as good as dead anyway\" routine, dual-citizenship means that countries like the United States or Germany may not be so keen on that.\n9. **This new conflict has seeped into the culture wars of the West to the benefit of Hamas and its allies.** Per the Economist today, this most recent round of conflict has generated increased support for Palestine among Western youth in particular and is piling political pressure onto democratic leaders. ([https://www.economist.com/international/2023/10/28/the-culture-war-over-the-gaza-war](https://www.economist.com/international/2023/10/28/the-culture-war-over-the-gaza-war)) President Biden, for example, faces a PR crisis that social media is amplifying for his support of Israel. The coalitions that liberal-leaning democratic leaders need to win often include more far-left voters, who are growing increasingly hostile over the Israeli response. As the Israeli assault on Gaza continues and social media in the West continues to churn, the current majority support for Israel among the center-left may decrease. \"From an Israeli point of view, though, the long-term trajectory of opinion in America is worrying. And in Europe, as the second world war recedes from living memory and the clout of Muslim voters grows, support for Israel may continue to soften, especially on the left.\" The end result of this is that Israel gets less Western support, which very much suits Hamas' interests. If, for example, President Biden is faced with the choice of supporting Israel or potentially creating the conditions for an election loss and a second Trump term, it will be hard to justify supporting Israel. Political pressure for a ceasefire might mount, resulting in a favorable outcome for Hamas as well. All in all, the polarization of the Western discourse over Israel is clocking in in favor of Hamas.\n\nHappy to hear people's thoughts on these points. For now, I feel like Hamas has really emerged from its attacks looking to be in a position far better than it has been in many years.",

If, somehow, they could bag ballistic missile launchers in Russian launching weapons at Ukraine that would almost certainly be of military and symbolic value, while also remaining an exclusively military target. If we shift though to a target like Rostov-on-Don, which is I believe in range of the long-range Storm Shadow variants, things get a lot more muddy. Rostov is *the* supply node, and probably has some juicy targets. Moreover Russia will have a ton of difficulty dispersing this node since it is (AFAIK) central to the overall war effort these days. BUT! its also probably the case that military and civilian targets will be heavily interspersed in ways that will make avoiding Russian civilian casualties basically impossible. You personally may not find that a big deal, perhaps even a just outcome, but its important not to let personal opinions cloud objective military analysis. Any attack which causes significant loss of Russian lives will be spun for Russia as evidence that their war is just and Ukraine is out to get them. It will further push popular support in Russia towards the regime, and help give pretext for deeper mobilizations. Which the regime has been very cagy about before, but which *are* a clear path for Russian escalation. And of course there is the Russian response, which may involve similar attacks on Kyiv or other Ukrainian cities. Not new, but my guess is that Kyiv would like to avoid attacks on its own civilians wherever possible. And thats before we get into qualitative escalation, though you are correct in that Russia has few attractive alternatives there remaining open to it. Its most important *conventional* pressure points though will remain diplomatic. Weve seen them tap into China, Iran, and North Korea for military aid. And those ties could presumably be significantly deepend in ways that will harm Ukraine. Attacking Russian cities provides further justification for eg. China getting more involved in the conflict, if they so choose. \n\nSo escalation in terms of the deployment of CBR weapons? Youre probably right, not much remaining room. Escalation in terms of producing negative outcomes for Ukraine? Absolutely. Its something that ought to be weighed very carefully, particularly if targets are out of reach of already provided systems or are otherwise hardened against attack. Striking a bunker in Rostov, killing 100 Russians, and not bagging the target theyre looking for would be IMO a disastrous outcome.",

We know very little about the facility currently, just that it's one of three new refurbishment plants being built, with the existing two facilities having pre-war capacities of approximately 20 vehicles a month each. (They were previously only focused on foreign exports, so the 20 vehicle a month capacity was likely more indicative of Russia's relatively limited export market for older tanks as opposed to the maximum capacity of the facility).   \n\n\nOnce all additional facilities are online the Russian MoD themselves will have significantly increased their vehicle refurbishment capacity, which stands to reason that Russia plans to continue refurbishing and redeploying tanks from its reserve bases.   \n\n\nIt adds to your point that Rostov-on-Don is a key node and that Russia has very little intention of dispersing it, you wouldn't actively build a high value refurbishment plant, one which will likely be a prime target, if you thought that Ukraine would directly strike Russian soil in that manner. That being said this could be hubris to some extent, there is a lot of inertia behind long term infrastructure moves such as this and these decisions can be difficult to unravel once they're moving. It might very well be the case that Ukraine continually strikes the facility (it would be in their best interest) with anything they can scrap together.   \n\n\nBut as an aside, Russia uses Rostov-on-Don as essentially the primary logistics node for largely the entire war effort, any disruption here would be significant. Russia has options for dispersal if they needed to, but all current indications (whether arrogance or not) are that Russia doesn't currently see a need to disperse its operations here.",

(They were previously only focused on foreign exports, so the 20 vehicle a month capacity was likely more indicative of Russia&#39;s relatively limited export market for older tanks as opposed to the maximum capacity of the facility).   </p>\n\n<p>Once all additional facilities are online the Russian MoD themselves will have significantly increased their vehicle refurbishment capacity, which stands to reason that Russia plans to continue refurbishing and redeploying tanks from its reserve bases.   </p>\n\n<p>It adds to your point that Rostov-on-Don is a key node and that Russia has very little intention of dispersing it, you wouldn&#39;t actively build a high value refurbishment plant, one which will likely be a prime target, if you thought that Ukraine would directly strike Russian soil in that manner. That being said this could be hubris to some extent, there is a lot of inertia behind long term infrastructure moves such as this and these decisions can be difficult to unravel once they&#39;re moving. It might very well be the case that Ukraine continually strikes the facility (it would be in their best interest) with anything they can scrap together.   </p>\n\n<p>But as an aside, Russia uses Rostov-on-Don as essentially the primary logistics node for largely the entire war effort, any disruption here would be significant. Russia has options for dispersal if they needed to, but all current indications (whether arrogance or not) are that Russia doesn&#39;t currently see a need to disperse its operations here.</p>\n</div>",

It is totally dependent upon the western aid and intelligence to prosecute this war. If US aid and intelligence stops, EU aid will soon start to taper off (considering the amounts it receives from EU now isn't much), after that, Ukraine will fight on for a bit, but will be forced to the table.\n\n------\n\n\n\n> you are only looking at this one dimensionally and belittling the war effort by calling it artificial.\n\nNo, nobody has said that. You are the one who has completely missed one extremely vital piece of fact: Arms & Ammunition.
