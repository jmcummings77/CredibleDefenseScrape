Stronger than last time.\n\n>Over the past 5-7 days, more than 10 large warehouses of artillery and other ammunition, several oil depots, about a dozen command posts and about the same number of personnel locations in our near and deep rear were hit.

Even during the invasion itself, stores would have been opened earlier, mines issued out, and more manpower would have meant they could have continued laying massive minefields as the Russians were advancing. \n\n\\- The Russian strategic axis of advance from Crimea would have suffered serious issues breaking out of the Isthmus of Perekop into Kherson oblast. If nothing else they should have been delayed. \n\n\\- Likewise, the UAF regional Operational Command East would have been more alert. Kherson itself wouldn't have fallen as the bridges on the Dnieper would have been blown. There would have been no advance on Mykolaiv either. Every city in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts would have had the ability to be defended as tenaciously as Mariupol.  \n\n\\- Similarly, in the OC-N area of operations primarily responsible for defending the Kyiv area would have likely shot down every VDV helicopter trying to air assault into airports around Kyiv or overrun them on the spot. As it was the Russians attempted three but only \"succeeded\" at Hostomel. None would have been successful if the UAF were ready. \n\n\\- The manner in which the Russians bounced off UAF defended areas when they were massed and ready enough to defend at places like Bucha, Irpin or even Kharkiv itself is proof that it could have been done closer to the border. Basically everywhere the Russians ran into even slight resistance within the first couple weeks they were either fully checked or forced to bypass. Had the UAF been fully mobilized, more smaller bridges would have been held or destroyed before the Russians could cross them, more key roads blocked (especially considering that the mud season and mines would have made offroading extremely dangerous to attempt), more key towns and villages held. Overall, the Russian inland advances would have been very very limited. \n\nI could go and on.

                "body": "I was the one in that thread you linked who was downvoted hard for daring to question the ~~stupidity~~ utter brilliance of the long term consequences of the UAF strategic plan to train the newest generation of UAF ~~cannon fodder~~ highly motivated and super capable troops for a whopping 3 weeks. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> It seems they are needed despite minimal training; otherwise having long term training to produce better soldiers would be a better option.\n\nAre you sure about that? Or is that because you assume the UA strategic leadership to be completely rational, to be the first combatant in the history of warfare who never made a strategic error? \n\nRight now, where are these UAF replacements needed? What is happening now or the recent past inside Ukraine that prevents the UA from training their replacements beyond 3 weeks before sending them into the meat grinder? Is Kyiv about to fall again? Odessa? Is losing the Donbas salient a strategic danger to UA survival?  \n\nI wont even get into the possibility of Kyiv dictated \"hold or die\" strategic defense of the Donbas salient, while attempting to match Russian in a battle of attrition, being a possible cause for heavier than necessary casualties. Let's just talk what actually happened. \n\nif the UAF are currently so badly hurt to need so many [untrained](https://mwi.usma.edu/time-is-not-on-kyivs-side-training-weapons-and-attrition-in-ukraine/) or barely trained replacements so quickly, then why are they expanding on the ongoing counteroffensive to retake the Kherson bridgehead and Kherson itself? \n\nWouldn't any rational student of military science and history expect the UAF to need more properly trained troops to execute a major offensive to break through three Russian defensive lines and then potentially assault and clear a city large enough to hold 100,000 people? If so, couldn't the UAF delay the counteroffensive for a few more weeks to actually bother training their offensive forces? And if they couldn't delay, why was that? Was that a choice, or was the situation forced on them? \n\nLet's turn back the clock a bit. The decision to train UA forces in the UK, which would have included cementing the curriculum and length of the training, was made back in June when Johnson around the time that he publicly announced the offer. Considering that was the height of the raging battle in the Donbas salient, it made sense, right? 60-200 KIA a day!!! But then if the manpower crisis was so bad then, why was the UAF still conducting [a major counteroffensive against Kherson](https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Kherson%20and%20Mykolaiv%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20June%2017%2C2022.png)? Obviously, such an operation would be a competitor to OC-E for manpower and ammunition, and would itself create more UAF casualties that would then need to be replaced. Did it the Kherson counteroffensive NEED to happen while the strategic main effort in the Donbas was in crisis mode?  \n\nHere is the sad truth: Ukraine's current manpower crisis is as self inflicted as the Red Army's was in summer 1941, when Stalin made it strategic policy to counterattack while refusing to allow retreats until it was too late and they were cut off.

                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I was the one in that thread you linked who was downvoted hard for daring to question the <del>stupidity</del> utter brilliance of the long term consequences of the UAF strategic plan to train the newest generation of UAF <del>cannon fodder</del> highly motivated and super capable troops for a whopping 3 weeks. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It seems they are needed despite minimal training; otherwise having long term training to produce better soldiers would be a better option.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Are you sure about that? Or is that because you assume the UA strategic leadership to be completely rational, to be the first combatant in the history of warfare who never made a strategic error? </p>\n\n<p>Right now, where are these UAF replacements needed? What is happening now or the recent past inside Ukraine that prevents the UA from training their replacements beyond 3 weeks before sending them into the meat grinder? Is Kyiv about to fall again? Odessa? Is losing the Donbas salient a strategic danger to UA survival?  </p>\n\n<p>I wont even get into the possibility of Kyiv dictated &quot;hold or die&quot; strategic defense of the Donbas salient, while attempting to match Russian in a battle of attrition, being a possible cause for heavier than necessary casualties. Let&#39;s just talk what actually happened. </p>\n\n<p>if the UAF are currently so badly hurt to need so many <a href=\"https://mwi.usma.edu/time-is-not-on-kyivs-side-training-weapons-and-attrition-in-ukraine/\">untrained</a> or barely trained replacements so quickly, then why are they expanding on the ongoing counteroffensive to retake the Kherson bridgehead and Kherson itself? </p>\n\n<p>Wouldn&#39;t any rational student of military science and history expect the UAF to need more properly trained troops to execute a major offensive to break through three Russian defensive lines and then potentially assault and clear a city large enough to hold 100,000 people? If so, couldn&#39;t the UAF delay the counteroffensive for a few more weeks to actually bother training their offensive forces? And if they couldn&#39;t delay, why was that? Was that a choice, or was the situation forced on them? </p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s turn back the clock a bit. The decision to train UA forces in the UK, which would have included cementing the curriculum and length of the training, was made back in June when Johnson around the time that he publicly announced the offer. Considering that was the height of the raging battle in the Donbas salient, it made sense, right? 60-200 KIA a day!!! But then if the manpower crisis was so bad then, why was the UAF still conducting <a href=\"https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Kherson%20and%20Mykolaiv%20Battle%20Map%20Draft%20June%2017%2C2022.png\">a major counteroffensive against Kherson</a>? Obviously, such an operation would be a competitor to OC-E for manpower and ammunition, and would itself create more UAF casualties that would then need to be replaced. Did it the Kherson counteroffensive NEED to happen while the strategic main effort in the Donbas was in crisis mode?  </p>\n\n<p>Here is the sad truth: Ukraine&#39;s current manpower crisis is as self inflicted as the Red Army&#39;s was in summer 1941, when Stalin made it strategic policy to counterattack while refusing to allow retreats until it was too late and they were cut off. Which like Ukraine&#39;s strategic decisions ended up causing heavier than necessary casualties. For the last few months, for whatever reason, the UAF have been and are currently voluntarily overextending themselves at the strategic level, which among other reasons is causing the excessive casualties they can&#39;t properly replace without drastic and highly dangerous means, which then creates an identical cycle as the Red Army in 1941: Shitty troops are made into casualties faster than better trained troops, which then requires cutting training for replacements, which in turn creates shitty troops, who in are then turned into casualties because they don&#39;t have a clue, while the units they belong to are incapable of effective combat operations, which means despite the heavy losses they still either fail the mission or succeed in a way that makes a pyrrhic victory.  </p>\n\n<p>And ultimately this problem comes down to the fact that the UA strategic senior civilian and military leadership has been and is current trying to do too much, violating a basic principle of warfare: Economy of force.</p>\n</div>",

That's basic, anything less is known to be too short, that's historically proven.

Should an all-out meat grinder war start, no doubt those countries would cut training shorter too but again, it's well known than anything under 6-8 weeks is outright counterproductive. It's creating nothing but cannon fodder.\n\n3 weeks of the training the UK is doing is the type and length given to service support troops who aren't actually expected to fight but need to learn the basics, just in case. However, if they're actually expected to fight then they need much more combat training, not only for their own sake but for their unit's ability to accomplish the mission.",

After a bit of prodding he said he wasn't sure of he supported the invasion, but that he knew Putin hadn't given the real reason (because the official explanations \"didn't sound right\" and \"it couldn't be just that\") - his theory was that Ukraine was developing nuclear weapons because Zelenskyy had said something. Also thought that Putin was \"just playing games with Ukraine\" because \"there is no way it could take this long if they were serious\". The conversation ended with a \"OK we aren't going to agree here\" but a common agreement that wars are bad and people should have more love for others.\n\nSimilar encounters with other working class Russian expats that I don't remember as well.
