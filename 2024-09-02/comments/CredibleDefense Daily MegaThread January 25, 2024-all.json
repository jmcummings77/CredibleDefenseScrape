They are still very good tanks, but there were obvious problems: first, the fact that the tankers from the 1st Tank Brigade transferred to the 47th Mechanized Brigade have had little time to train together with the rest of the brigade. This would match with a [statement](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/18c3gwb/comment/kc8d8af/) by an UAV operator from the 47th Brigade who revealed that the first Leopard lost in action during the counteroffensive was hit by friendly fire from an unit of the National Guard engaged in the action, but due to crew negligence. Also, the 1st Tank Brigade did not receive 31 Leopard 2A5/6s, as originally thought, to equip an entire battalion, but probably had only one squadron/reinforced company, I think around 18 tanks. The 10 Leopard 2A5s (Strv 122), along with a handful of Leopard 2A6s, went to form the tank company of the 21st Mechanized Brigade.\n\nIn general, the 47th Brigade has had a troubled history regarding gear: it was born as a reconnaissance battalion, became the 47th Assault Regiment, specialized for urban combat, then reformed to become the 47th Mechanized Brigade, at first one of the many that Ukraine raised in late 2022. It had begun training with MaxxPro MRAPs when it was chosen that this brigade would be the spearhead of the counteroffensive and was set to receive the best equipment available, spending months training in Germany with US trainers from the 1st Infantry Division. \n\nAnd by now I almost came to think that the story that they received Slovenian M-55s was a psyop or something similar, maybe to underestimate the real capabilities and tasks of the brigade. These tanks were likely never received by the 47th Brigade but were assigned to the 67th Mechanized Brigade to form its tank battalion. Interesting enough, the 67th Brigade then appears to have been re-equipped with T-64BVs and the M-55s seem to have disappeared from the front line for several months already.\n\nP.S. The deliveries to Ukraine of 14 Leopard 2A4s from German stocks funded by the Netherlands and Denmark have begun. So it means that Ukraine, including losses, will receive 54 Leopard 2A4s in total. In early 2023 it was said that Leopard 2A4s were to equip a tank battalion of the 4th Tank Brigade. This battalion was later detached from this brigade and moved to the 33rd Mechanized Brigade. So it means that Ukraine, if it doesn't replenish the losses of the 33rd Brigade, has almost a battalion of Leopard 2A4s in reserve. As for the nearly 200 incoming Leopard 1A5s, the first batches were used to form the tank battalion of the new 44th Mechanized Brigade. Recently, [pictures](https://twitter.com/Osinttechnical/status/1748513361627643960) (have to use Twitter as Nitter doesn't seem to work today) have come out that see them also in service with the 25th Airborne Brigade, which probably received them to expand its tank company formed by T-80BVs. It's assumed that the 5th Tank Brigade (which is being created) will largely have these tanks, and possibly I imagine some of the existing brigades could receive a battalion of Leopard 1A5s to replace the losses of Soviet ones, or perhaps they will go to equip some of the new five mechanized brigades being formed.",

Turkey wants to retire its F-4 jets and to upgrade F-16s as a stopgap measure until it can develop its own warplanes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My understanding is that Biden can override the Congressional approval, so this seems like a done deal.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "Maybe of little interest; but a few weeks back I remember a thread related to the return of sentenced violent criminals to freedom after serving 6months in Ukraine, and prisoner recruitment policies in general. Liza Fokht published an [article for the BBC](https://www.bbc.com/russian/articles/clev58319pvo) on the change of conditions for prison recruits since October which I though was quite interesting (although it is based on the June 2023 legalization of the practice, so it's possible it has been at least partially discussed before here).\n\nIn general, the terms for release have been hardened since at least October 2023. The service time is no longer limited to 6 months but to the end of the war and there is no longer a full pardon but only a conditional release. Prisoners can be freed if they receive state awards or in case of severe injury though. The decision to free a prisoner no longer relies on Presidential pardons, nor on court decisions, but on the decision of the penitentiary establishment and the recruiting officer in charge of the prisoner. This change has the benefit of making the whole process much less public and avoiding headlines such as \"the Samara cannibal and the Khabarovsk serial killer have been pardoned by Putin\" and the impact they have on the population. It keeps Putin's name out of such articles and the idea of criminals being \"conditionally released\" is more palatable than talking of pardons - hopefully, it also means that the more dangerous prisoners might not be granted their freedom in spite of their service. It also means they will be kept on the frontline for much longer, presumably until the end of the war or their death/heavy injury for most of them.\n\nI remember in the past there was also some discussion of Ukrainian practice. As of now, the number of prisoners who received a presidential pardon is still at only 363 since April 2022, while Russia was at 5000 in March of last year (from what I understand the Ukrainians were pardoned before their service, as it was not legal to integrate them in the army while they were still sentenced; the 363 number represents the only 3 waves of recruitment which took place from February to April 2022, whereas the number for Russian prisoners represents the pardons for the first waves of recruits, at the end of their service, with total numbers in dozens of thousands now). Officially, this was only open to prisoners who committed no heavy/violent crime and had prior combat experience, but some pardons clearly went against these rules (like the pardon of Tornado battalion fighters) - however it should be noted that it was then said that prisoners who committed serious crimes and had prior experience could still in some cases join the armed forces, just that they would see their detention conditions softened rather than receiving a pardon, so the 363 number may be an understatement of the actual number of prisoners who were recruited at the time, but I have not been able to find any information about any recruits from prison who had not been part of these pardoned. The idea of recruiting prisoners was put on hold after April 2022 though, due to the high numbers of volunteers at the time making it unnecessary, and never relaunched later, out of fears of it being perceived as analogous to what Russia was doing. It's also known that Zaluzhnyi has repeatedly opposed the recruitment of prisoners in any way or form, at least in part due to the impact it could have on the reputation of the armed forces. Some deputies and officials (HR ombudsman [Lubinets](https://nv.ua/ukr/ukraine/politics/mobilizaciya-v-ukrajini-chi-diysno-zaluzhniy-proti-uv-yaznenih-v-lavah-zsu-novini-ukrajini-50384878.html)) have expressed the desire to re-open the recruitment of prisoners in recent months, and some notorious imprisoned nationalists have been asking to have the right to serve in the military; there have been talks of re-opening voluntary participation or even mobilising prisoners in recent times, in the context of the discussion on the new law on mobilisation, which is meant to be adopted soon (the law aims at extending mobilisation to new categories of citizens who are exempt as of now). \n\nReportedly, Zaluzhnyi is still firmly opposed to the idea, and it was not included in the previous draft law (which was rebuffed for different reasons), so it seems rather unlikely to happen anytime soon in spite of increasing difficulties with recruitment. It might also simply not be worth it, in regards to the costs in term of image for the UAF among the Ukrainian population but also international supporters: Ukraine's carceral population is much smaller than Russia's. At the start of the invasion, it was at about 50,000 (in 2021, probably more now) vs. 430,000 in Russia (much smaller now though, at [226K in October 2023](https://www.severreal.org/a/v-koloniyah-rossii-ostalos-226-tysyach-chelovek-eto-istoricheskiy-rekord/32626340.html)).",
