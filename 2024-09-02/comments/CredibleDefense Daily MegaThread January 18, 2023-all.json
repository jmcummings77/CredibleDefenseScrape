The beauty of modern social media is that we don't need to guess anymore what the other side of a conflict is thinking. And sometimes, (like when this week when I shared a post about how Rybar is thinking about tank warfare), it can actually be insightful and interesting. And lest we forget RU sources can generate credible news too: the best stories about how awful initial mobilization (drafting dying men)  was going came from RT's own editor in chief on Telegram! Framed in that way and with those caveats, I think posts from pro-RU media sources should be okay to post.\n\nWhat then is noncredible/not worth posting from RU media? In my view:\n\n- Uncorroborated gossip. We don't need to share an RU blogger's 367th prediction of the soon-to-happen (trust us) offensive towards Kharkiv. The bloggers love drawing arrows on maps, but unless if its corroborated by sat images, Western osint, or NATO/Ukraine, that's all it is: lines on a map.\n\n- Obvious pro-RU propaganda. These posts are clear enough: they will prattle on about how the Russian military has the most artillery/anti-air/tanks/war industrial production available, more than NATO, and that's why Ukraine will lose and also that it's better if Ukraine not fight at all, because defeat is inevitable. Before he vanished yet again, Armchair Warlord was the prima donna of this crowd, as an example.\n\n- Nonsense posts (self-explanatory)\n\n- Spurious claims of war crimes. This ranges from the literal insane (biolabs! Dirty bombs! Ukraine did Bucha!) to the less obviously not made up. For that latter category, I see a lot of recurring posts about civilian targets being in Donetsk coming from RU sources. These aren't worth posting in my opinion for the following reasons: 1) Donetsk remains a war zone, so finding ultimate culpability will require an independent investigation by a future party--these are daily megathreads, not courts of law seeking establish provable facts 2) Russia being a non-credible actor sours their reputation. We can just easily think Russia is bombing Donetsk and blaming Ukraine. 3) Again--and I really want to stress this, Donetsk is a frontline city. Ukraine could very well be bombing Donetsk, targeting only valid military targets. We don't know--and we cannot trust what we see reported as it is not corroborated.\n\nOther than, I've got mad respect for the moderators keeping this place civil, and, well, credible.",

The Russians in their \u201ctrials\u201d likely did not know many of the details and issues of this tactic, especially considering just how embarrassing in terms of skill  the regular Russian army was (and still is) compared to the considerably more experienced l/dnr militants.</p></li>\n</ul>\n</div>",

The two nations mentioned here are Israel and South Korea. A couple things become clear in reading this:\n\n- Domestic stockpiles are low\n\n- Domestic production can't keep up with demand, at least in the immediate to short term\n\n- this policy is not sustainable. Not only will the stockpiles run out, but depleting them risks leaving America with its own 1915 shell crisis should a major war break out that America is directly involved in\n\n- Israel and Korea both have to deal with Russia on the regular (more Israel than Korea, but still) and this is making diplomacy harder for them, which strains the alliances further.\n\nNow let's look at the numbers and do the math:\n\n- The US has sent 1 million shells to Ukraine. Half of those came from Korea and Israel.\n\n- Ukraine burns 90k rounds a month. If we assume that burn rate is steady since the conflict start (it isn't but let's just assume),  Ukraine will burn 1.080 million shells per year, which is more than they have received since the war's start.\n\nWe can safely assume that stockpiles in Israel and Korea are finite resources. Once those dry up, the question becomes: can the US ramp up shell production to ensure at least 90k rounds a month are not only made but delivered to Ukraine? That's the real challenge, here--delivery. Shells are extremely heavy and take up a lot of space, and physics limit how much we can physically send in a boat/train. But production is also key: if the US can't make more shells and fast, that will put Ukraine at a real disadvantage.\n\nThat being said, Russia is having its own supply issues, so this is not critical yet.

The Nivelle Offensive especially was extremely deadly for the French, since the Germans had a new defensive system partly in (the remains) of towns and villages, even if that wasn't the preferred field of fighting. Generally the Western front managed to often completely decimate whatever urban system ended up very near or at the frontline, and whatever urban fighting there was happened before artillery had the chance to completely raze the place. Obviously there are exceptions, but I imagine Bakhmut would also look like a very different place if the Russians and Ukrainians were using ten times the artillery they are.\n\nThe Eastern Front on the other hand was very mobile and armies regularly crossed through intact urban areas, but the Russian Civil War took WW1-esque fighting even to larger urban centers. Tsarytsin is a good example. The situation in those battles is a bit hazy since a lot of information has been lost, but for example in the final weeks during the battle for Tsarytsin, the White armies entrenched themselves in the ourskirts of the city and managed to inflict huge losses on the Reds before they were forced to pull out.",

This war is massive, and we have to start providing the equipment and training necessary based upon the war's size.\n\n(edit 2) news reports (see above) state that the US will provide another 50 Bradleys and 100 Strykers.

Roughly speaking - and excluding tanks - that's about 5 brigades, or a little shy of 2 divisions (you can also make the argument that it's actually 3 brigades or 1 division, but that's not my point).

Diesels, the air comes in, is filtered but goes from the carburettor to the piston then tot he exhaust missing most of the high speed moving parts. </p>\n\n<p>Also turbine blades are a lot more expensive than pistons so the engines can cost significantly more. The USSR ditched turbines from T-80 when it moved to t-90 and even changed T-80 to a diesel version. </p>\n\n<p>I am not a engineer with specialist knowledge so there may be more issues around heat and the weight of the blades???</p>\n</div>",

First, politically, it's unacceptable. Everyone is united on this front except Russia, and it would deal long term, permanent damage to Russia's international standing - *even among its allies and neutral countries.* Second, NATO's response may well be to assist the UAF through coordinated air strikes and may make any follow on assault much more likely to succeed. Or, NATO may strike elsewhere that may weaken Russia in unpredictable ways - like destroying the Tartus port facilities and thus driving the Russian Navy out of the Mediterranean. Third, such use may encourage nuclear arms development among countries that are hostile or not very friendly to Russia, including Poland and South Korea, perhaps Turkey. Such a strike against Ukraine may leave Russia with nuclear armed powers on or very near its borders.\n\nThe best thing the west can do is to reiterate these points and insist that the war remain conventional, and to encourage Russia's friends and allies to do so behind closed doors.
