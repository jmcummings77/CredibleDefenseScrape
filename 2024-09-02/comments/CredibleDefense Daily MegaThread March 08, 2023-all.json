it takes better leadership and command and control,\u201d he added.\n\n>Though lacking in quality, Russian forces have been able to leverage overwhelming advantage in manpower and artillery shells.\n\n>With much higher value placed on equipment, ammunition, and the lives of its soldiers, Ukraine is objectively not able to attack in the same way.\n\n>Hard and costly as it may be, mounting a large offensive in the first half of 2023 is also seen as a political imperative for Ukraine, whose leaders have pledged to liberate all territories occupied both before and after Feb. 24, 2022.\n\n>\u201cIn order to do that,\u201d said Lee, \u201cUkraine needs to achieve another Kharkiv-type operation, where they can really rapidly progress in one direction and try to collapse Russian lines, and exploit it in a way that makes it difficult for Russia to reconsolidate.\u201d\n\n>As for where such an offensive might take place, there is one direction that has dominated the discussion for good reason.\n\n>\u201cIt's clear that a decisive offensive is something that's only going to happen in the south,\u201d said Kofman, \u201cit\u2019s clear to anyone who takes a glance at the map.\u201d\n\n>A large-scale thrust south into the partially-occupied southeastern Zaporizhzhia Oblast, taking the key transport hub of Melitopol and potentially reaching the coast of the Azov Sea, would not only cut off Russia\u2019s coveted \u201cland bridge\u201d to occupied Crimea, but would also allow Ukraine to strike the Crimean Bridge and isolate Russia\u2019s foothold on the peninsula.\n\n>Crucial will be Ukraine\u2019s ability to first degrade and exhaust Russian forces while on the defensive, at minimal cost to their own units. \n\n>\u201cEvery time Russia is getting into fights like in Vuhledar where they are taking heavy casualties and Ukraine is not, that is a good thing,\u201d said Lee. \n\n>\u201cBecause then, Ukraine might find a part of the front lines where Russia is weak and they can't defend properly.\u201d\n\n>\u201cUkraine needs a lot more Vuhledars and a lot fewer Bakhmuts,\u201d Kofman added.\n\n>Kyiv is making no attempt to hide its preparations. As it gradually receives more Western tanks and IFVs over the spring, Ukraine is forming a new force auspiciously named the Offensive Guard, consisting of six specialized assault brigades coordinated by the National Guard.\n\n>When the time comes to launch the attack, Ukraine will need everything to go right, according to Lee.\n\n>\u201cIt's difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn't mean Ukraine can't succeed, but they have to be very smart about finding the weakest point in Russian lines, do the best shaping operations beforehand, having the best units, the best NATO-standard mission command decision-making.\u201d\n\n>On March 5, Ukrainian military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said that Russia would \u201crun out of military tools\u201d i.e. offensive potential, by the end of spring. \n\n>Russia\u2019s performance in its latest offensive looks so far to back this up, but after it culminates, all eyes will be on Ukraine\u2019s. \n\n>With Russian artillery fire still outweighing that of Ukraine, and talk of China potentially taking the plunge and supplying munitions to Moscow, experts agree that a long, attritional fight will only work in Russia\u2019s favor.\n\n>Whatever the result, it is more than likely that the spring campaign will decide whether the war will lurch towards total Ukrainian victory, or slowly begin to freeze.\n\n>\u201cI think Ukraine will have success,\u201d said Lee, \u201cbut the question is how much.\u201d\n\n>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be difficult to achieve, but the one thing we've seen in this war is the Ukrainians do pretty remarkable things.\u201d",

The relocation puts submarines beyond the first island chain where American RAP short-range acoustic sensor networks are situated to track subsurface vessels. \n\nShe also asserts that possession of the island would enable the Chinese to position their own sensor networks.

The relocation puts submarines beyond the first island chain where American RAP short-range acoustic sensor networks are situated to track subsurface vessels. </p>\n\n<p>She also asserts that possession of the island would enable the Chinese to position their own sensor networks. While it would require significant advances in technology not presently available to PLAN, Chinese acoustic sensors could one day be used to deny American submarines access to the waters around China and be used in a satellite networked kill-chain aimed at surface vessels.</p>\n</div>",

Lawmakers also heard from a young Army medic who is still haunted by images of trying to save his fellow soldiers killed during that attack. And veterans who scrambled and set up mini State Departments to evacuate Afghan allies recounted frustration with the U.S. government's lack of planning and continued problems as they try to process visas.\n\n>Vargas-Andrews said he and another Marine assigned to protect the airport received intelligence about a possible suicide bomber approaching the area. He said they spotted him and his associate in the crowd and alerted supervisors and requested authority to engage but never got it. He told the panel he believes those individuals were responsible for the attack. \"Plain and simple, we were ignored,\" he said.\n\n>\"My body was overwhelmed from the trauma of the blast. My abdomen had been ripped open. Every inch of my exposed body took ball bearing and shrapnel.\" He said no one interviewed him about the attack in the investigation that followed.\n\n\n>Retired Lt. Col. David Scott Mann, the founder of Task Force Pineapple, a volunteer network of veterans who served in Afghanistan, told the committee the experience working to get allies \u2014 often translators and former Afghan military fighters \u2014 was \"gutting.\" He warned that the U.S. is on the \"front end of a mental-health tsunami.\" He said calls to the VA hotline spiked 81% in the first year since the withdrawal. Mann reported a friend whom he served with was found dead in a hotel room in the aftermath and his wife told Mann the incident reignited trauma about his experience in Afghanistan and the way allies were treated as the U.S. left.\n\n>\"We might be done with Afghanistan, but it is not done with us.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/03/08/1161890168/house-republicans-hearing-withdrawal-afghanistan-biden\">https://www.npr.org/2023/03/08/1161890168/house-republicans-hearing-withdrawal-afghanistan-biden</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The House Foreign Affairs panel&#39;s first oversight hearing on what happened leading up to and after the U.S. end to a more than 20-year war featured emotional and graphic testimony from a Marine injured in the bombing at the Abbey Gate at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul. Lawmakers also heard from a young Army medic who is still haunted by images of trying to save his fellow soldiers killed during that attack. And veterans who scrambled and set up mini State Departments to evacuate Afghan allies recounted frustration with the U.S. government&#39;s lack of planning and continued problems as they try to process visas.</p>\n\n<p>Vargas-Andrews said he and another Marine assigned to protect the airport received intelligence about a possible suicide bomber approaching the area. He said they spotted him and his associate in the crowd and alerted supervisors and requested authority to engage but never got it. He told the panel he believes those individuals were responsible for the attack. &quot;Plain and simple, we were ignored,&quot; he said.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;My body was overwhelmed from the trauma of the blast. My abdomen had been ripped open. Every inch of my exposed body took ball bearing and shrapnel.&quot; He said no one interviewed him about the attack in the investigation that followed.</p>\n\n<p>Retired Lt. Col. David Scott Mann, the founder of Task Force Pineapple, a volunteer network of veterans who served in Afghanistan, told the committee the experience working to get allies \u2014 often translators and former Afghan military fighters \u2014 was &quot;gutting.&quot; He warned that the U.S. is on the &quot;front end of a mental-health tsunami.&quot; He said calls to the VA hotline spiked 81% in the first year since the withdrawal. Mann reported a friend whom he served with was found dead in a hotel room in the aftermath and his wife told Mann the incident reignited trauma about his experience in Afghanistan and the way allies were treated as the U.S. left.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We might be done with Afghanistan, but it is not done with us. The enemy has a vote. If we don&#39;t set politics aside and pursue accountability and lessons learned to address this grievous moral injury on our military community and right the wrongs that have been inflicted in our most at risk Afghan allies, this colossal foreign policy failure will follow us home,&quot; Mann said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

The conclusions and proposals of the commission are then considered at a meeting of the Rada, which will vote on whether to adopt the accusations; a two-thirds vote is needed to proceed. The charges are then reviewed by the Constitutional Court of Ukraine as well as the Supreme Court of Ukraine; the former rules whether the investigation properly observed constitutional procedure, the latter on whether the accusations against the president rise to the level of state treason or another crime. Finally, a three-quarters vote in the Rada is necessary to convict the president and remove them from office.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Ukraine's current overall top priority military objective is to liberate occupied territory. If it's top priority was to defend the rest of unoccupied Ukraine, the UA government would be doing things like falling back to favorable defensive positions and possibly focusing all of their efforts on setting up heavy DMZ-like fortifications and negotiating for peace to buy time. \n\nThis is obviously not the case. Right now Ukraine is looking to destroy/repulse the Russian forces out of its country. So when asking why the UAF is not retreating to favorable positions west of Bakhmut, their are a few things to realize: even if Ukraine is fighting a 1:1 kill ratio battle (which is worst case), this is still a favorable situation to alternatives that Ukraine (presumably) knows it is likely planning to find itself in: an offensive. (Emphasis on knows: they know for sure what they are planning, but not what the Russians are. Important to remember that). The last offensive in Kherson, Ukraine very likely lost more troops than Russia did. \n\nWith this in mind, generally speaking, Ukraine would obviously much rather fight defensively than offensively because of the favorable kill ratio. In this sort of defensive strategy with an offensive objective, sure it is important to have good defensive positions, **but it is more important that the enemy keeps attacking you**. \n\nIt might seem certain that Russia will keep attacking in this desperate fashion once they take Bakhmut because of what the Kremlin has said and what their current behavior is like. But if you are a Ukrainian commander, you aren't going to see anything in the future as certain. If Ukraine gives up Bakhmut for favorable positions, it is very possible that political victory is enough for the Russians to start reconstituting. Maybe Surovikin and Gerasimov play musical chairs. Maybe they change their current plans and stop large attacks. This would be an extremely unfavorable situation for Ukraine and those 'better' defensive positions would not be of value. But what can Ukraine commanders be certain of? That Russia is throwing bodies at Bakhmut, because it is currently happening. Russia is currently fighting a battle that is on Ukrainian terms and is in line with their overall goal. The only thing you can be certain of in war are present situations, and any planning for the future in hopes of somehow having a more favorable situation compared to the already favorable one you have will always have the risk of putting you in a worse position.",

They ended up only doing the former after taking advice from the US that they couldn't succeed if they tried the latter too. But immediately after telling everyone they were going to do it, the Russians peeled off a large chunk of their force structure in the Donbas and sent them to reinforce Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, namely about 30,000 troops in the Eastern Military District (think of those as a mix between field army and army group command level).\n\nBecause Putin was unwilling to mobilize at the time, and they couldn't reinforce Ukraine with the large number of new units that it required, and because he refused to compromise and prioritize taking the Donbas or holding the South (he tried to do both), refused to retreat from either Kharkiv or Kherson bridgehead to dramatically shorten the line, it meant they were very weak in certain locations, by choice, by design. They made the decision to weaken the Kharkiv sector near Balakliya, making a poorly calculated risk that because they no longer believed that the Izyum axis was important, that the Ukrainians wouldn't attack it. \n\nThe Ukrainians were worried about their planned Kherson offensive, because it had been heavily reinforced, so needed a supporting offensive somewhere else to try to take pressure off.. When they spotted the weakness around Balakliya, they pulled a couple veteran brigades off the line temporarily, plussed them up with more combat units and a battery of M777 apiece to use PGM shells, rehearsed for a week with rock drill map exercises for the command team, and then launched a front loaded, massed, five brigades assault, with heavy tactical use of HIMARS, against the weakest sector of the Russian lines. \n\nSince then Russian doubled its manpower in Ukraine. Built fixed fortifications everywhere in depth. Retreated from Kherson to shorten the strategic line, requiring far less units to defend the Dnieper, etc. Yes, it's politically costly to mobilize again, but it's not nearly as costly as doing it the first time. \n\nNot counting the crazy assumptions always part of it (namely that they'll quit fighting the war because of manpower losses), Kill Ratio strategy is a math based formula where strength and losses are supposed to be known. But they're not known, they can't be known because they don't know how many Russians can be committed. The entire equation had to be tossed when Russia did their first partial mobilization and it'll have to be tossed again if they do it again. \n\nNor does it work when other variables must be  considered but muddle up the stats. 5:1 KIA exchange. Okay, what was that in total casualties, specifically WIA? The way Wagner attacked, they're going to take heavy KIA in relation to WIA. The way Ukraine defends and their biggest threat, HE frag, they're mostly going to take WIA. \n\nOr how about that Wagner built an expendable force solely to help take Bakhmut. The Ukrainians used to defend it were NOT raised to become casualties defending Bakhmut. The strategic reserves they've had to pull from multiple times to rotate units and reinforce (like again recently) were NOT raised to become casualties defending Bakhmut. What is 5 apple divided by 1 orange? A math problem that doesn't mean anything. \n\nAssuming the Ukrainians are in favor of using defensive strategy to break the Russians, they need to rely on solid defensive positions. Vulhedar is a perfect example. It's working, don't retreat (though they still need to plan for it eventually because no fixed fortification should ever be viewed as impassable). But when the fixed defenses end up being breached, and defenders are forced to use hasty defenses that are worsened by rampant threat of being outflanked, with their supply lines barely holding on, with the threat of encirclement dangerously present, they need to take the steps to reset to resume fighting from advantageous positions. That means either counterattack to retake the vulnerable flanks, or retreat to a fresh line to repeat the whole thing again.\n\nBut nobody wins wars defensively, they need to go on the offensive.. Just because they're on the offensive doesn't necessarily mean they'll be taking heavy losses either.

If they have one extra vote and steel themselves, they can ram it through the parliament but the protests getting more out of hand. I think you'd have to be a fly on the wall in their group meeting to say how the discussions are going right now. Maybe Georgian media has access to insider information? They seem to be pretty TV and press heavy, as the country has low internet penetration.

Probably the beginning of the end if the Ukrainian army is still in a state of sufficient personnel and equipment. If the speed of retaking Kherson would be an indication of the speed of taking territory: It takes two months to take a large city, 25 km beyond the front. The distance of the front to the Azov sea is about 100 km, and has two cities to take (either Melitopol and Berdyansk, or Beryansk and Mariupol), that would take between 4 to 8 months. A similar time for Donetsh city. A bit longer time for Luhansk city when Donetsk city is taken. A bit shorter time for Kherson oblast. Then a few months clearing Luhansk oblast. Lastly about 14 to 18 months for Crimea. I guess a total of 33 to 55 months fore removing Russia from Ukraine when Ukraine has a reached a definite artillery and equipment advantage.

And that\u2019s what really frustrates me. People are woefully naive and arrogant in regards to Russia\u2019s endurance. Russia can and will expend 100s of thousands of men and material to wait out the west. They will use every piece of conventional equipment they have if they need to. And they have the nuclear and economic deterrents needed to do this without concern for a second conflict opening on their boarder.</p>\n\n<p>The only way Ukraine can come out of this with a realistically positive future is with decisive and overwhelming support.</p>\n</div>",
