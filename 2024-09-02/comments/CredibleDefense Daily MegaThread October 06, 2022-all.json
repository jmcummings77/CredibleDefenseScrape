See recent \"nuke train\" frenzy that lasted for days based off the flimsiest of evidence. Just today an article was running in the WaPo delineating Russia's nuclear arsenal. No doubt policymakers are constantly talking about it too. Literally every day the US makes some kind of statement about how they're monitoring Russia's nuclear arsenal.  What more would you have people talk about?\n\nAs for deescelation and stopping this immediately? What exactly do you propose?  Should we tell the Ukrainians they cannot fight for their country?

That being said, an underground nuclear test would be too entrenched in existing norms to make much an effect.\n\nRather, an east-to-west missile launch, detonated over an empty stretch of land in Siberia, would likely cause immense panic while limiting the US response, as well as China and India's reaction (they nuked themselves; so what?). If Russia really wanted to go all out in the terrorism, they could even construct a potemkin version of Kyiv, complete with a mannequin of Zelensky.\n\nI have no evidence to share that this is going to happen; this is mere guesswork to estimate what might actually happen next. After all, let's review all the nuclear options:\n\n1) Russia deploys no nuclear weapons\n\n2) Russia conducts an underground nuclear test\n\n3) Russia conducts an atmospheric test\n\n4) Russia deploys tactical nuke(s) against Ukrainian troops\n\n5) Russia deploys strategic nukes against Ukrainian cities\n\nOptions 4 and 5 have an escalatory path straight through war with NATO, and likely to be the last of the last options to be considered. 1 is the status quo, and let's be honest, as Russia continues to lose, who amongst us thinks Putin will abjectly surrender all his gains without lashing out somehow? That leaves 2 and 3 as intermediate options for escalation. 2 is, shall we say: bland. North Korea could detonate an underground test today and it would likely just lead to a collective shrug; a Russian detonation would be even more shrugged. So, in my mind, this leaves 3.\n\nIt is likely that seeing a nuclear cloud form may cause some level of panic around world governments, especially after decades of that not being the case. Ukraine itself would be hard-pressed to limit civilian and military panic. It's one thing to stand up to the distant possibility of nuclear weapons; it is another entirely to see it being deployed in-atmosphere.\n\nI think, unfortunately for the world environment, that the US should respond in kind: test their own atmospheric nuke. That would signal a tit for tat. If Russia uses a nuke, America would use a nuke. That might create a narrow enough thread to allow for some level of nuclear deescalation.\n\nOf course, there's no guarantee of any of this.

Many felt they were too big, too rigid, and too hot. Relied too much on the steel plates. After a few years a number of snake oil companies popped up, most famously Dragon Scale, which promised more flexibility and also better armor protection by layering ceramic scales over the chest. But it turned out that Dragon Scale and knock offs were *worse* then what what they were replacing, and afforded almost no protection over Kevlar alone. So the Army banned them. But the whole fiasco helped spur on the development of new better carriers that did reduce weight and increase flexibility somewhat. Also important that this whole dragon scale fiasco overlapped with the Humvee armor crisis, which included CNN broadcasting pictures of bloody Hummers with vests (hopefully not Dragon Scale!) taped to the inside.",

I mostly meant in regards to him getting seemingly annoyed at the hosts for doing their job of steering and structuring the discussion. There was a podcast with some academic that Kofman featured on (can't remember which one) where the host kept really prepositioning the questions by essentially railroading Kofman to explain the base theories as a part of it. The host was clearly a great lecturer and applied it to his interview by formulating his questions in a way a student would, knowing what a student wouldn't know. It was great since it made Kofman quickly summarize the base concepts where necessary before moving on to how they relate to the current topic. I wish I saved the name of the podcast, it was really good. It was also the only one where Kofman wasn't frustrated at a single point throughout and genuinly seemed happy start to finish haha.\n \n>  but he is not dealing with quantum physics\n\nIt doesn't matter I think. This applies to every field that requires years of study. Abstracting years of knowledge learned from studies and actively working in the field and presenting it in an easy to grasp format for a layman without prior, or similar knowledge and without losing important context is incredibly hard.

I mostly meant in regards to him getting seemingly annoyed at the hosts for doing their job of steering and structuring the discussion. There was a podcast with some academic that Kofman featured on (can&#39;t remember which one) where the host kept really prepositioning the questions by essentially railroading Kofman to explain the base theories as a part of it. The host was clearly a great lecturer and applied it to his interview by formulating his questions in a way a student would, knowing what a student wouldn&#39;t know. It was great since it made Kofman quickly summarize the base concepts where necessary before moving on to how they relate to the current topic. I wish I saved the name of the podcast, it was really good. It was also the only one where Kofman wasn&#39;t frustrated at a single point throughout and genuinly seemed happy start to finish haha.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>but he is not dealing with quantum physics</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It doesn&#39;t matter I think. This applies to every field that requires years of study. Abstracting years of knowledge learned from studies and actively working in the field and presenting it in an easy to grasp format for a layman without prior, or similar knowledge and without losing important context is incredibly hard.

Officials say Taiwan needs to become a \u201cporcupine\u201d with enough weapons to hold out if the Chinese military blockades and invades it, even if Washington decides to send troops.*\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/05/us/politics/taiwan-biden-weapons-china.html\n\nAmerican officials are intensifying efforts to build a giant stockpile of weapons in Taiwan after studying recent naval and air force exercises by the Chinese military around the island, according to current and former officials.\n\nThe exercises showed that China would probably blockade the island as a prelude to any attempted invasion, and Taiwan would have to hold out on its own until the United States or other nations intervened, if they decided to do that, the current and former officials say.\n\nBut the effort to transform Taiwan into a weapons depot faces challenges. The United States and its allies have prioritized sending weapons to Ukraine, which is reducing those countries\u2019 stockpiles, and arms makers are reluctant to open new production lines without a steady stream of long-term orders.\n\nAnd it is unclear how China might respond if the United States accelerates shipments of weapons to Taiwan, a democratic, self-governing island that Beijing claims is Chinese territory.\n\nU.S. officials are determining the quantity and types of weapons sold to Taiwan by quietly telling Taiwanese officials and American arms makers that they will reject orders for some large systems in favor of a greater number of smaller, more mobile weapons. The Biden administration announced on Sept. 2 that it had approved its sixth weapons package for Taiwan \u2014 a $1.1 billion sale that includes 60 Harpoon coastal antiship missiles. U.S. officials are also discussing how to streamline the sale-and-delivery process.\n\nPresident Biden said last month that the United States is \u201cnot encouraging\u201d Taiwan\u2019s independence, adding, \u201cThat\u2019s their decision.\u201d Since 1979, Washington has had a policy of reassuring Beijing that it does not support independence. But China\u2019s foreign minister, Wang Yi, said in a speech at the Asia Society last month that the United States was undermining that position \u201cby repeated official exchanges and arms sales, including many offensive weapons.\u201d\n\nThe People\u2019s Liberation Army of China carried out exercises in August with naval ships and fighter jets in zones close to Taiwan. It also fired ballistic missiles into the waters off Taiwan\u2019s coast, four of which went over the island, according to Japan.\n\nThe Chinese military acted after Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the House, visited Taiwan. But even before that, U.S. and Taiwanese officials had been more closely examining the potential for an invasion because Russia\u2019s assault on Ukraine had made the possibility seem more real, though Chinese leaders have not explicitly stated a timeline for establishing rule over Taiwan.\n\nThe United States would not be able to resupply Taiwan as easily as Ukraine because of the lack of ground routes from neighboring countries. The goal now, officials say, is to ensure that Taiwan has enough arms to defend itself until help arrives. Mr. Biden said last month that U.S. troops would defend Taiwan if China were to carry out an \u201cunprecedented attack\u201d on the island \u2014 the fourth time he has stated that commitment and a shift from a preference for \u201cstrategic ambiguity\u201d on Taiwan among U.S. presidents.\n\n\u201cStockpiling in Taiwan is a very active point of discussion,\u201d said Jacob Stokes, a fellow at the Center for a New American Security who advised Mr. Biden on Asia policy when he was vice president. \u201cAnd if you have it, how do you harden it and how do you disperse it so Chinese missiles can\u2019t destroy it?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe view is we need to lengthen the amount of time Taiwan can hold out on its own,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s how you avoid China picking the low-hanging fruit of its \u2018fait accompli\u2019 strategy \u2014 that they\u2019ve won the day before we\u2019ve gotten there, that is assuming we intervene.\u201d\n\nU.S. officials increasingly emphasize Taiwan\u2019s need for smaller, mobile weapons that can be lethal against Chinese warships and jets while being able to evade attacks, which is central to so-called asymmetric warfare.\n\n\u201cShoot-and-scoot\u201d types of armaments are popular with the Ukrainian military, which has used shoulder-fired Javelin and NLAW antitank guided missiles and Stinger antiaircraft missiles effectively against Russian forces. Recently, the Ukrainians have pummeled Russian troops with mobile American-made rocket launchers known as HIMARS.",

Mr. Biden said last month that U.S. troops would defend Taiwan if China were to carry out an \u201cunprecedented attack\u201d on the island \u2014 the fourth time he has stated that commitment and a shift from a preference for \u201cstrategic ambiguity\u201d on Taiwan among U.S. presidents.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cStockpiling in Taiwan is a very active point of discussion,\u201d said Jacob Stokes, a fellow at the Center for a New American Security who advised Mr. Biden on Asia policy when he was vice president. \u201cAnd if you have it, how do you harden it and how do you disperse it so Chinese missiles can\u2019t destroy it?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe view is we need to lengthen the amount of time Taiwan can hold out on its own,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s how you avoid China picking the low-hanging fruit of its \u2018fait accompli\u2019 strategy \u2014 that they\u2019ve won the day before we\u2019ve gotten there, that is assuming we intervene.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>U.S. officials increasingly emphasize Taiwan\u2019s need for smaller, mobile weapons that can be lethal against Chinese warships and jets while being able to evade attacks, which is central to so-called asymmetric warfare.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cShoot-and-scoot\u201d types of armaments are popular with the Ukrainian military, which has used shoulder-fired Javelin and NLAW antitank guided missiles and Stinger antiaircraft missiles effectively against Russian forces. Recently, the Ukrainians have pummeled Russian troops with mobile American-made rocket launchers known as HIMARS.</p>\n</div>",

Taiwan also produces its own deterrent weapons, including minelayer ships, air defense missile systems and antiship cruise missiles.\n\nThey said Taiwan needs to shift resources away from \u201cexpensive, high-profile conventional systems\u201d that China can easily destroy in an initial attack, though some of those systems, notably F-16 jets, are useful for countering ongoing Chinese fighter jet and ship activities in \u201cgray zone\u201d airspace and waters.

Arms directors from the United States and more than 40 other nations met last week in Brussels to discuss long-term supply and production issues.\n\nIf China decides to establish a naval blockade around Taiwan, American officials would probably study which avenue of resupplying Taiwan \u2014 by sea or by air \u2014 would offer the least likelihood of bringing Chinese and American ships, aircraft and submarines into direct conflict.\n\nOne proposition would involve sending U.S. cargo planes with supplies from bases in Japan and Guam to Taiwan\u2019s east coast. That way, any Chinese fighters trying to shoot them down would have to fly over Taiwan and risk being downed by Taiwanese warplanes.\n\n\u201cThe sheer amount of materiel that would likely be needed in case of war is formidable, and getting them through would be difficult, though may be doable,\u201d said Eric Wertheim, a defense consultant and author of \u201cThe Naval Institute Guide to Combat Fleets of the World.\u201d \u201cThe question is: How much risk is China and the White House willing to take in terms of enforcing or breaking through a blockade, respectively, and can it be sustained?\u201d\n\nChina has probably studied the strategic failure of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, he said, and the United States should continue to send the kinds of arms to Taiwan that will make either an amphibious invasion or an attack with long-range weapons much more difficult for China.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese naval officers I\u2019ve spoken to in years past have said they fear the humiliation that would result from any kind of failure, and this of course has the effect of them being less likely to take action if there is an increased risk of failure,\u201d Mr. Wertheim said. \u201cIn essence, the success the Ukrainians are having is a message to the Chinese.\u201d\n\nOfficials in the Biden administration are trying to gauge what moves would deter China without actually provoking greater military action.\n\nJessica Chen Weiss, a professor of government at Cornell University who worked on China policy this past year in the State Department, wrote on Twitter that Mr. Biden\u2019s recent remarks committing U.S. troops to defending Taiwan were \u201cdangerous.\u201d She said in an interview that pursuing the porcupine strategy enhances deterrence but that taking what she deems symbolic steps on Taiwan\u2019s diplomatic status does not.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. has to make clear that the U.S. doesn\u2019t have a strategic interest in having Taiwan being permanently separated from mainland China,\u201d she said.\n\nBut other former U.S. officials praise Mr. Biden\u2019s forceful statements, saying greater \u201cstrategic clarity\u201d bolsters deterrence.\n\n\u201cPresident Biden has said now four times that we would defend Taiwan, but each time he says it someone walks it back,\u201d said Harry B.

The first is that Putin is a war criminal; he should be pressured, not negotiated with. And the second is that even if Ukraine is ready to sign some agreements on guarantees with Putin, they are not. We can sign [an agreement] with you [Ukraine], but not with him. Anyway, he will screw everyone over\", is how one of Zelenskyy's close associates summed up the essence of Johnson's visit.\n>\n>Behind this visit and Johnson's words, there is much more than a simple reluctance to get involved in agreements with Russia.\n>\n>Johnson\u2019s position was that the collective West, which back in February had suggested Zelenskyy should surrender and flee, now felt that Putin was not really as powerful as they had previously imagined.\n>\n>Moreover, there is a chance to \"press\" him. And the West wants to use it.\n>\n>Three days after Johnson, now the happy owner of a Vasylkiv rooster, flew back to foggy Albion, Putin went public and said talks with Ukraine \"had reached a dead end\".\n>\n>\"We reached a certain level of agreement in Istanbul, which was that security guarantees for Ukraine\u2026 would not extend to the territory of Crimea, Sevastopol and Donbas ... Now security  guarantees are one thing, and the issue of regulating relations with Crimea, Sevastopol and Donbas is being pushed out of these agreements\", Putin said.\n>\n>Three days later, Roman Abramovich arrived in Kyiv again, and President Zelenskyy officially stated that there could be two security agreements with Russia: one would regulate Ukraine's own coexistence with Russia, the other would only cover security guarantees.\n>\n>\"Moscow would like to have a single agreement in which all the issues are resolved.

                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>There was a <a href=\"https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/articles/2022/05/5/7344096/\">piece from Pravda in May</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Russian side, no matter what anyone says, can read signals and was actually ready for the Zelenskyy-Putin meeting.</p>\n\n<p>But two things happened, after which Mykhailo Podoliak, a member of the Ukrainian delegation, had to openly admit that now was &quot;not the time&quot; for a meeting between the presidents.</p>\n\n<p>The first thing was the revelation of the atrocities, rapes, murders, massacres, looting, indiscriminate bombings and hundreds and thousands of other war crimes committed by Russian troops in the temporarily occupied Ukrainian territories\u2026</p>\n\n<p>How and what can we talk about with Putin, if we cannot talk to him about Bucha, Irpin, Borodianka or Azovstal?...</p>\n\n<p>The moral gap, the gap in values, between Putin and the rest of the world is so huge that even the Kremlin doesn\u2019t have a long enough negotiating table to cover it.</p>\n\n<p>The second - much more unexpected - &quot;obstacle&quot; to agreements with the Russians arrived in Kyiv on 9 April.</p>\n\n<p>\u2026</p>\n\n<p>As soon as the Ukrainian negotiators and Abramovich/Medinsky, following the outcome of Istanbul, had agreed on the structure of a future possible agreement in general terms, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson appeared in Kyiv almost without warning.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Johnson brought two simple messages to Kyiv. The first is that Putin is a war criminal; he should be pressured, not negotiated with. And the second is that even if Ukraine is ready to sign some agreements on guarantees with Putin, they are not. We can sign [an agreement] with you [Ukraine], but not with him. Anyway, he will screw everyone over&quot;, is how one of Zelenskyy&#39;s close associates summed up the essence of Johnson&#39;s visit.</p>\n\n<p>Behind this visit and Johnson&#39;s words, there is much more than a simple reluctance to get involved in agreements with Russia.</p>\n\n<p>Johnson\u2019s position was that the collective West, which back in February had suggested Zelenskyy should surrender and flee, now felt that Putin was not really as powerful as they had previously imagined.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, there is a chance to &quot;press&quot; him. And the West wants to use it.</p>\n\n<p>Three days after Johnson, now the happy owner of a Vasylkiv rooster, flew back to foggy Albion, Putin went public and said talks with Ukraine &quot;had reached a dead end&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We reached a certain level of agreement in Istanbul, which was that security guarantees for Ukraine\u2026 would not extend to the territory of Crimea, Sevastopol and Donbas ... Now security  guarantees are one thing, and the issue of regulating relations with Crimea, Sevastopol and Donbas is being pushed out of these agreements&quot;, Putin said.</p>\n\n<p>Three days later, Roman Abramovich arrived in Kyiv again, and President Zelenskyy officially stated that there could be two security agreements with Russia: one would regulate Ukraine&#39;s own coexistence with Russia, the other would only cover security guarantees.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Moscow would like to have a single agreement in which all the issues are resolved. However, not everyone sees themselves at the same table with Russia. For them, security guarantees for Ukraine is one issue, and agreements with Russia is another issue.</p>\n\n<p>Russia wants everything to be in one document, and people are saying, \u2018I&#39;m sorry, we saw what happened in Bucha, the circumstances are changing\u2019,&quot; Zelenskyy relayed Johnson&#39;s message to Putin.</p>\n\n<p>After that, the bilateral negotiation process was put on hold.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",
