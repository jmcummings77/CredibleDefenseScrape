But there is a ballpark figure to extrapolate from, and we can at least reasonably conclude that each gun (however it will be integrated into Ukrainian air defence) will cost at least several million euros. In addition the thing is particularly effective because of a radar unit optimised for detecting low flying, low RCS targets, and it works with special ammunition that is programmed as it leaves the barrel (AHEAD).\n\nEven if Ukraine gets it much cheaper, it still won't be 'cheap' relative to the small perimeter it can defend against low-flying targets.

Little two birds with one stone action. But I think tying up troops along the northern border (moreso than already were) would be a nice fringe benefit. The issue is its hard to just tie troops down without some kind of action. An Army in being may be threatening, but Ukraine has almost certainly already taken precautions against movement across their border, we have rumors of instability in Belarus, and reports of equipment flowing eastward away from the new potential sector. All these factors suggest Belarus *wont* be the staging ground for a new offensive. Ukraine wont want to risk wasting its forces by diverting more units to the border, so probably given the uncertain picture theyre willing to trust the terrain (which is very bad) and their defenses (which you'd hope would be very good at this point) to slow down any surprise attack. This could change though if Russia started launching cross border operations. Not even an invasion, but recon in force or SOF raids would give the Ukrainians something more to think about. Until we see some fighting over the border I just dont think this whole sidestory really changes Ukraine's operational posture much. \n\nAs for Bakhmut, I think youre probably right. Those attacks are sopping attacks. Russia needs to pin down forces, launching their own continuous attacks does that. Ukraine is forced to defend in Bakhmut instead of thinning the line out in favor of elsewhere. The fact that the elite Wagner PMC seems to be spearheading the attack while we hear other forces are leaving the area reinforces this idea to me. You dont want to waste an elite unit, we could debate how elite Wagner really is, BUT! using a more capable unit to cover the relocation of other troops is a well tested strategy. If you assume Wagner is a cut above, they can continue to threaten Bakhmut and provide the core of a solid force, while the needed mass goes elsewhere. Ukraine has to cover that axis because Wagner will break through if you let them, but can be stopped if you invest the proper men and material. And of course I've seen no indication that the nature of fighting has changed that much in that region since the summer, so the artillery drumbeat probably inflicts some casualties on Ukraine which further saps their forces and diverts men away from the counterattacks.",

Australia wouldn\u2019t have bought the sub butfor these officers, who profited off of the deal through salaries and by diverting business to Electric Boat. Scary. \n\nBut you could read it another way, the US and Australia are treaty allies and have substantial interests in the same geographic region. In many ways Australia is really the closest US partner in the Pacific. Doesn\u2019t it make sense that US officials would help to create links between the Australian Navy and the US Navy? Like we want them to understand our thinking and we want to understand theirs as part of inter alliance cooperation. Moreover it makes sense to me that *if* Australia was going to buy a sub design from abroad that representatives of interested companies would participate in that process. Like as it became clear than an EB design was a serious contender in the selection process, you would expect that EB reps are going to be involved, doing paid work naturally, in helping AuG to make their choice and navigate issues around acquiring a new system. I would expect the French company had a similar slate of personnel there doing the same thing AND that they AuG was appreciative of their presence in making the final decision. In that light all this seems rather natural to me. \n\nSo what about the civilian angle and the ex-officer angle? Well we know first that the DoD has privatized a significant amount of their operations since their founding, and in the last 100 years development of new systems has largely moved from within the services to private contractors. So if a country wants to acquire anything, a sub to a rifle, they don\u2019t call the DoD they call Colt, or GD, or EB, who actually make and own the stuff country x wants. The DoD comes in later to okay the deal. And we also know that, as a perk for service, the federal government has imposed preferential hiring requirements on most contractors as well as within officialdom itself. On USAJOBS apps are selected on an automated points system, veteran status (so I\u2019ve heard) is the *single largest point get* an app can have. Same with private contractors who also can take advantage of tax credits for hiring vets. And of course ex-officers are vets just like any other, often have advanced degrees alongside service expertise, and have very relevant skills to the private contractor. All this is to say it makes natural sense to me that ex-officer reps would have a role in these deals. \n\nSo idk. Idk what is really corrupt about this deal, and given the system that has been built up idk what we expect EB or any other contractor to do. This seems to me to be a very different story than the Saudi one WAPO published a few days ago. But even there, you would expect these military relationships to include a good number of civilian ex-officers, who naturally want to get paid for post-service work. Do we expect all these guys to go flip burgers? They arnt going to go teach, public education pays dogshit and there are zero university level jobs out there right now for anyone. So what exactly is the shocking story?",

It's a cover to seem like everything that happened in the first phase went to plan. If they planned badly but managed to pull off a win, the subordinate troops look good but General Staff look like shit.  But if they can successfully float the story that it all went as planned, they look like geniuses.\n\nFirst, if their strategy focused on defending Kyiv, why were only two UAF brigades even in that oblast west of the river? Why were the majority still defending the JFO? Of the two in Kyiv oblast, why was one still far south of Kyiv at its home station base? \n\nSecond, whatever war plan the UAF GenStab created to realistically defend Ukraine wouldn't have been based on not being mobilized, which the Ukrainians weren't. Units weren't ready, were not manning defensive positions anywhere near their battle positions, only those whose home stations were already near invasion routes were able to respond quickly. The TDF, who they were obviously very reliant on, barely existed besides on paper until D-Day. \n\nThird, it should be obvious the Ukrainians didn't plan to allow the Russians to drive so far into Ukraine they'd outrun their logistics, that's just what happened because the Ukrainians weren't ready (nor were the Russians!). For instance, the Crimea breakout, the greatest Russian success, was obviously not planned for, as that land was extremely valuable militarily, economically, and politically. We're to believe they let the Russians drive 220 kilometers from the border before defending outside Mykolaiv, where the Russians reached their culmination point? \n\nThe Ukrainians even had charges on the roads and bridges leading through the Isthmus of Perekop, only one bridge was blown up, that led to the death of the Ukraine soldier who detonated it, who Zelensky praised. As he did resistance within Kherson oblast east of the river. Elements of two UAF brigades were in Kherson oblast when the Russians attacked, it's not known what happened but it's pretty naive to think they were stationed east of the river but had orders to retreat, not blow the Dnieper bridges, and allow the Russians to nearly take Mykolaiv.\n\nIncursions from other fronts were similar, they tried stopping the Russians earlier but often failed until they were able to mass and the Russians reached their culmination point. I posted about this in detail months ago, but anybody can go through day 1-15 updates on MilitaryLand.net, his maps track Russian advances and known Ukraine defensive positions, you can see how many times they tried and failed to stop the Russians. Kyiv-Chernihiv-Sumy, Donbas, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, Mykolaiv, all those oblasts saw failed positional defenses and more Russian advances. \n\nFourth, we have months of examples of other UA defensive ops where the Ukrainians didn't give up an inch unless they had to, stubbornly clinging to ground whatever the cost, only retreating when no other tactical option was left. They did that AFTER already losing 20% of their country and suffering horrible losses in the process, and that decision was made by the exact same people who led the defense during the first phase.

No, but at the same time, it's dubious that there has ever been more fighting on the same pieces of land at that intensity for such a long period. \n\nLikewise, even if the conflict stalemates, that doesn't necessarily benefit Russia. Time is on the Ukrainian side as long as western allies are willing to ramp up military aid. The longer the conflict goes on, the more equipment, and better equipment, will Ukraine have access to, while Russia's relatively fixed stock of tactical equipment continues to dwindle. \n\nSo in short, stalement is not necessarily a bad thing.",

No, but at the same time, it&#39;s dubious that there has ever been more fighting on the same pieces of land at that intensity for such a long period. </p>\n\n<p>Likewise, even if the conflict stalemates, that doesn&#39;t necessarily benefit Russia. Time is on the Ukrainian side as long as western allies are willing to ramp up military aid. The longer the conflict goes on, the more equipment, and better equipment, will Ukraine have access to, while Russia&#39;s relatively fixed stock of tactical equipment continues to dwindle. </p>\n\n<p>So in short, stalement is not necessarily a bad thing.</p>\n</div>",
