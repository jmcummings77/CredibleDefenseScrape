And if one does, then one must a tankie! Fascist! Nazi! <em>Serb</em>!</p>\n\n<p>So yeah, it depends on the offensive war.</p>\n</div>",

Yes, I&#39;m considering the Ukrainian natural resources and the semiconductor plants--the juice isn&#39;t worth the squeeze on the oil/gas/minerals and TSMC facilities will be useless in the first 40 minutes of hostilities. We&#39;re in another weird era where Realpolitik has yielded to deeply ideologic conflicts. That&#39;s terrifying. Rational actors can be bargained with via rational incentives. Irrational actors will chain themselves to the hull of a sinking ship. I have no idea where the war in Ukraine is going to go, but I&#39;m convinced it will get way more intense and a lot more bizarre before it stops.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "*The Hunt to Arm Ukraine Leads to Difficult Choices. The U.S. and NATO are scouring the world for new sources of old weapons to send to Ukraine. But it risks as much peril for some nations as it does promise for Kyiv.*\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/11/world/europe/ukraine-cyprus-arms-race.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare\n\nThe Russian strikes that hit civilian targets across Ukraine this week immediately brought new pledges by Kyiv\u2019s allies to send in more weapons and ammunition. The United States promised more air defense missile systems, and Germany said it would send similar defenses \u201cin the next few days.\u201d The NATO chief declared that support to Ukraine\u2019s fight against Russia would continue \u201cfor as long as it takes.\u201d\n\nBut for all of the assurances, there remains a problem. Kyiv also needs more of the Russian-style weapons that the Ukrainian military is trained to use, and the available global supply of them is running low.\n\nTo find those weapons, the United States and other allies have been scouring the globe, looking for willing suppliers in a hunt that has revealed both the promise and pitfalls of unlocking stockpiles of Russian-standard and Soviet-style weapons for use by Ukraine.\n\nThere have been some successes. Finland, which has long balanced the sensitivities of its Russian neighbor, is sending Ukraine some Soviet-style weapons, including ammunition and guns compatible with the AK-47 assault rifle. South Korea is supplying ballistic vests, helmets, medical equipment and other defense assistance.\n\nCambodia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Mexico, Colombia and Peru have each received a recent visit from Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a painstaking, behind-the-scenes diplomatic campaign to countries that have demonstrated support for Ukraine but are still reluctant to supply lethal aid.\n\nAnd then there is Cyprus. It has presented a special window on the difficulties of keeping up with the urgent demand for arms that Ukraine\u2019s troops are burning through faster than can be supplied as they claw back large swaths of territory and push the Russians to retreat.\n\nUntil this month, Cyprus had been under a U.S. arms embargo for 35 years, imposed to help tamp down tensions after a conflict left the island bitterly divided between a government backed by Greece and a portion still controlled by Turkey \u2014 both NATO members.\n\nIn that time, Cyprus turned to the Soviet Union and then Russia for weapons and military equipment. Today its stockpile of at least 10 Tor and Buk missile systems that can down Russian aircraft, drones and cruise missiles could provide a bonanza for an embattled Ukrainian army.\n\nBut the Cypriot government has made clear it wants new and better replacements, something that could antagonize Turkey and reignite an arms race in the still unresolved conflict. Even so, on Oct. 1, the Biden administration formally lifted the embargo, allowing Cyprus to buy American weapons.\n\nAmerican officials said the move was several years in the making and broadly intended to pull Cyprus away from Russian influence. But one U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity to describe the delicate diplomacy, said Cyprus was now \u201ca potential option\u201d as a supplier to Ukraine.\n\nCyprus \u201cwould be ready to consider\u201d transferring some of its weapons and ammunition to Ukraine if they were \u201creplaced with other military apparatus of equal power and capabilities,\u201d Marios Pelekanos, a government spokesman, said in a statement to The New York Times.\n\nHe cited numerous meetings with American officials in recent months, during which \u201cwe have also discussed this possibility.\u201d\n\nAlready, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has pledged to reinforce his troops in northern Cyprus with additional weapons as the U.S. embargo is lifted.\n\nThe State Department spokesman, Ned Price, said on Tuesday that \u201cwe welcome additional contributions to provide Ukraine with the continued support it needs to defend itself\u201d but would not discuss diplomatic conversations with specific nations, including Cyprus.\n\nOn Monday, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine called on allies to speed air defense systems to his country as \u201ccurrently the No. 1 priority.\u201d Already, NATO nations have committed to sending Ukraine billions of dollars in sophisticated Western weapons \u2014 including about $17 billion from the United States alone.\n\nRussia is responding by buying artillery from North Korea and, notably, military drones from Iran, which have blitzed southern Ukrainian cities and last week struck a town about 50 miles outside Kyiv. Dozens of countries have sought to remain neutral, including China and India, which are Russia\u2019s two largest weapons customers but which on Monday renewed calls for de-escalation after Moscow\u2019s missile strikes.\n\nEastern European nations, many of which were once satellites of the Soviet Union but are now NATO members, have eagerly sent Russian-standard equipment to Ukraine since February: tanks and artillery munitions from the Czech Republic, howitzer guns from Estonia, helicopters from Latvia and Slovakia, and amphibious infantry combat vehicles and thousands of 122 mm-caliber Grad rockets from Poland.\n\nAs of Tuesday, the latest data available, Poland was the fourth-largest contributor of military aid to Ukraine, following the United States, Britain and the European Union, according to a database of public commitments compiled by the German-based Kiel Institute. But Poland, like other Eastern European nations, cannot spare its remaining stockpile of Soviet-style weapons without risking its own defenses and wants to see other countries step up, a Polish defense official said.\n\nTalks among allies to share parts, ammunition and other equipment, and to prod defense manufacturers to ramp up production are continuing, including this week at a high-level meeting at NATO headquarters in Brussels. But weapons contracts can take months, if not years, to complete.\n\nJens Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary general, said on Tuesday that the defense ministers would be asked to decide how best to quickly replenish member states\u2019 stockpiles while still providing Ukraine with a range of weapons \u2014 not just air defense systems, he said, but also more artillery, armored tanks and ammunition.\n\n\u201cThey need almost everything, and allies are providing unprecedented support,\u201d Mr. Stoltenberg said in Brussels.\n\nA possible blueprint for helping Ukraine acquire more arms was provided in July by the Foundation of Defense of Democracies, a Washington think-tank, which identified 23 non-NATO nations that have a combined stockpile of more than 6,300 post-Soviet and Russian-standard weapons systems and ammunition, and have condemned Mr. Putin\u2019s invasion.\n\nAmong the potential suppliers, Cyprus stands out.\n\nWith its Russian-made rocket launchers, surface-to-air missiles, helicopters, tanks and armored vehicles, Cyprus holds \u201cthe very systems that Ukraine needs to support its counteroffensives, and to hold the territory that they retake \u2014 and, more broadly, to defeat Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine,\u201d said Bradley Bowman, a former U.S. Army officer and senior military expert at FDD who co-authored the analysis.\n\nBefore the embargo was lifted, Mr. Bowman noted, \u201ceven though there had been discussions, we could never seriously contemplate replacing these Russian-origin weapons, that Cyprus could transfer to Ukraine, with American systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut now we can,\u201d Mr. Bowman said. He added, \u201cWe need to look under every possible rock.\u201d\n\nCypriot officials hailed the embargo\u2019s lifting as an important step toward strengthening ties with NATO and bolstering security in the eastern Mediterranean Sea.\n\nBut, they said, it did not mean Nicosia was ready to send its Russian weapons to Ukraine.\n\n\u201cGiven the serious security threats posed on a daily basis by the Turkish occupation forces, the current security architecture of Cyprus ought to remain intact,\u201d Mr. Pelekanos said.\n\nAcknowledging Nicosia\u2019s \u201clegitimate security concerns,\u201d Mr. Bowman said the lifting of the arms embargo would also allow other Western nations to quickly transfer their American-made weapons to Cyprus without first obtaining approval from Washington. That, he said, could replenish Cyprus\u2019s arsenals with newer, NATO-compatible systems if it transferred its post-Soviet arms and ammunition to Ukraine.\n\nAt that point, Cyprus might be in a position to help \u2014 even if it remains unclear who might be willing to pull from their own arsenals to backfill Nicosia.\n\nEventually, it is expected that Cyprus will phase out its current weapons with systems that are compatible with NATO, pulling away from Russia and manufacturers in other rogue states.\n\nYet defense contractors in the United States and Europe are already struggling to keep up with demand in weapons production \u2014 a process that can take years.\n\nIn the meantime, the U.S. official said, Ukrainian forces need the weapons \u201cright now, more than ever.\u201d",

            "body": "This was a HUGE issue during the Vietnam war, and it\u2019s important to remember that one (of several) problems PGMs were supposed to solve was bridge demolition. The [Thanh Hoa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanh_H\u00f3a_Bridge) bridge became a nightmare for American pilots. From 1964-1968 dozens of sorties were flown, thousands of bombs dropped, and the bridge was never knocked out for more than a few days at a time. Why? Because dumb bombs are inaccurate, and punching holes in the road deck isn\u2019t really helpful. You have to hit the pillars, and that\u2019s hard from the air. Especially given north Vietnams tenacious air defense of the bridge. In 1972, however, the bridge was hit again. This time with first Gen LGBs, in their first (AFAIK) combat deployment. The first raid dropped half the span into the river and seriously damaged one abutment. The second dropped the other half. Then a third sortie, with dumb bombs, flattened whatever was left. Total destruction, tho the bridge would have been longterm inoperable after the first raid. \n\nSince then the USAF has spent a lot of time doing two things. First developing better weapons and bombs designed to hit bridges at their weakest, and second designing better tactics to make sure the bombs end up on target. A lot can go into bridge demolition, which requires smart pilots and good planning. Bridges are also obvious targets, so SEAD and CAP(usually) are a must. But with LGBs, penetration bombs if you have to go through the deck, and even stuff like JSOW it\u2019s easy to knock out a bridge even temporarily. And then the real secret is follow up. As much, the issue with Thanh Hoa was that damage did not occurs often enough to keep it knocked out long term. Raids have to happen more frequently, or if not do more damage each time. \n\nIf you wanted to use the USAF to knock out the bridge they have a number of tools. An F-15/-16/-18/-35 package could be inserted easily, with SEAD and top cover, to strike the foundations from the side. Bring enough planes to absolutely overwhelm the defenders. Put LGBs on each pile, and drop both spans over a significant distance. Then assess and follow up as needed. Follow up raids could target engineers, equipment (repair barge or train), or repaired sections themselves. A JSOW would be perfect for this mission. Conversely a B2 with a belly of 2000lb bombs would make a lot of holes. And of course a nuke. This was an option within AirLand Battle, using F-111s to do high speed penetration runs to drop nukes on German and Polish bridges. \n\nThe issue Ukraine has obviously is it\u2019s not the USAF or US Navy. They can\u2019t surge 12 (the number of Phantoms that finally knocked out Thanh Hoa. And that\u2019s before SEAD and escort) aircraft to knock out a single bridge, no matter how valuable. And the Su-25 is no F-4. Indeed few Air Forces could do what the USAF might find simple. Idk that the Kerch bridge is a simple operation, but it\u2019s the kind of thing the Air Force and Navy have planned for. Conceptually it\u2019s not a hard problem, but often in war even small things became large.",

Because dumb bombs are inaccurate, and punching holes in the road deck isn\u2019t really helpful. You have to hit the pillars, and that\u2019s hard from the air. Especially given north Vietnams tenacious air defense of the bridge. In 1972, however, the bridge was hit again. This time with first Gen LGBs, in their first (AFAIK) combat deployment. The first raid dropped half the span into the river and seriously damaged one abutment. The second dropped the other half. Then a third sortie, with dumb bombs, flattened whatever was left. Total destruction, tho the bridge would have been longterm inoperable after the first raid. </p>\n\n<p>Since then the USAF has spent a lot of time doing two things. First developing better weapons and bombs designed to hit bridges at their weakest, and second designing better tactics to make sure the bombs end up on target. A lot can go into bridge demolition, which requires smart pilots and good planning. Bridges are also obvious targets, so SEAD and CAP(usually) are a must. But with LGBs, penetration bombs if you have to go through the deck, and even stuff like JSOW it\u2019s easy to knock out a bridge even temporarily. And then the real secret is follow up. As much, the issue with Thanh Hoa was that damage did not occurs often enough to keep it knocked out long term. Raids have to happen more frequently, or if not do more damage each time. </p>\n\n<p>If you wanted to use the USAF to knock out the bridge they have a number of tools. An F-15/-16/-18/-35 package could be inserted easily, with SEAD and top cover, to strike the foundations from the side. Bring enough planes to absolutely overwhelm the defenders. Put LGBs on each pile, and drop both spans over a significant distance. Then assess and follow up as needed. Follow up raids could target engineers, equipment (repair barge or train), or repaired sections themselves. A JSOW would be perfect for this mission. Conversely a B2 with a belly of 2000lb bombs would make a lot of holes. And of course a nuke. This was an option within AirLand Battle, using F-111s to do high speed penetration runs to drop nukes on German and Polish bridges. </p>\n\n<p>The issue Ukraine has obviously is it\u2019s not the USAF or US Navy. They can\u2019t surge 12 (the number of Phantoms that finally knocked out Thanh Hoa. And that\u2019s before SEAD and escort) aircraft to knock out a single bridge, no matter how valuable. And the Su-25 is no F-4. Indeed few Air Forces could do what the USAF might find simple. Idk that the Kerch bridge is a simple operation, but it\u2019s the kind of thing the Air Force and Navy have planned for. Conceptually it\u2019s not a hard problem, but often in war even small things became large.</p>\n</div>",

The AGM-86 ALCM would certainly have the range to do it well within safety, and the AGM-86D includes a 1,200 lbs bunker penetrating warhead. Ignoring AD entirely the GBU-28, a 5,000 lbs bunker penetrating laser guided bomb could certainly target a pylon, although the target designating aircraft would probably have to be flying relatively low to do so, or have a ground based team using a laser designation to do so.

If you've seen footage of operators bracketing in a rectangular cursor of some sort to indicate what to track, that's almost certainly an area correlation matching calculation under the hood. It takes the bracketed area and stores it between frames of the live sensor. Then for each incoming frame it computes a motion vector via correlation, in camera coordinates. This determines the new orientation of the bracket, and that area is stored for comparison in the next iteration of the algorithm. .This math is pretty comparable to how modern video compression codecs reuse information between frames. But what's most cool about this is once the track is acquired, the view can evolve substantially from that initial match and the track will be maintained via continuity of motion alone. So for example a TLAM can match its terminal target, then still engage in a pop up maneuver that substantially changes the view of the target without losing the match, even if those new views aren't in the database.

That\u2019s not a matter of negotiations, yet. \n\n(Even completely rational actors can fight wars, for a variety of reasons. There\u2019s a game theoretic academic literature on this.)\n\nAbout your broader point that wars end in negotiations, that\u2019s trivially true in a useless way. WW2 ended with the unconditional surrenders of Japan and Germany, but that\u2019s hardly the way this \u201cnegotiations\u201d claim gets used in this context. \n\nRather, this is about the outcome\u2014the division of the pie\u2014that is reached, and specifically being used as a short code for \u201cUkraine should make concessions to Russia to end this war\u201d.\n\nIf you are very concerned about the risk of nuclear war, don\u2019t care about Ukraine, ok, sure. \n\nI\u2019m more concerned about not normalizing a 19th-century style land grab, the atrocities being committed by Russia in the occupied areas, validating an attempt at nuclear blackmail.

If anything, this would be a FARA violation at most, but no federal prosecutor would pursue Musk over this (unless he was specifically lobbying US government officials, not just espousing on Twitter; even then, it'd be easier to pursue a USC 18--lying to the feds).\n\nThat being said, let's look at what Musk (Putin) is proposing:\n\n> - Redo elections of annexed regions under UN supervision. Russia leaves if that is will of the people.\n\nThe only reason he's singled out these areas for elections is because he's seized these territories. If military conquest opens the door to UN-supervised elections, then that is not a great incentive for states. Not to mention: the divisibility of states and borders should more or less be a settled affair in Europe and the Americas. While there are some problem areas that might need revision (Ireland), or some areas displeased by the status quo (Hungary), we should not reopen the door to allow wars to settle these border conflicts. Else, we might as well grant full statehood to every territorial ambition of every subnational area, from Catalonia to Two Sicilies and Byzantium.\n\n> - Crimea formally part of Russia, as it has been since 1783 (until Khrushchev\u2019s mistake).\n\nCrimea, especially after 2014, has plenty of ethnic Russians who are happy with being part of Russia. Regardless of what Khrushchev did, this makes the issue of Crimea a sticky issue. To restore Crimea to Ukraine, we might need to see a mass population transfer. It's tricky, and I don't envy Ukrainian planners on how to reintegrate the region.\n\nThat being said, Russia doesn't need Crimea for access to the Black Sea. They have Rostov. It's not a strategic imperative, and I challenge the military thinkers who think so.\n\n> - Water supply to Crimea assured.\n\nWater rights contracts should be upheld once peace returns. Crimea has a right to water, as does every other area in the world.\n\n> - Ukraine remains neutral.\n\nThis is meaningless. NATO already militarily (if not kinetically) supports Ukraine. If Russia attacked Ukraine again after a period of peace, that would still remain in place. If this provision is meant to preclude NATO from supplying an independent Ukraine, there's no way Russia could stop that, outside of outright conquest or war with NATO. For NATO to agree to treating Ukraine like Switzerland, both sides would need an iron-like agreement in stone. And even then, there's no trust for that now, especially after the war.\n\nSo all in all, none of the proposed peace plan points are acceptable or good ideas, even taking them at face value, except for restoring Crimean water rights.\n\nHere's my counterproposal for Putin:\n\n- Russia pulls out of all occupied Ukrainian territories, in a phased method using UN troops to conduct peacekeeping ops. Crimea will continue to be occupied by Russia until a final peace accord and decision about the population is made.\n\n- An immediate ceasefire is carried out. Both forces will pull away from border regions and declare a demil zone on the border to prevent incidents.\n\n- Ukraine is given Russia's seized forex reserves as war reparations, plus punitive energy rights (Russia to export oil and gas to Ukraine at discounted prices for x years).\n\nThis would lead to peace immediately. From there:\n\n- Russian sanctions are rolled back, provided energy deliveries to Europe and Ukraine continue and provided peace prevails.\n\n- The CSTO is disbanded.\n\n- Contigent on political reforms, Russia and Belarus are re-welcomed into the Western sphere.\n\n- Both Russia and Ukraine become NATO candidates. Both guarantee each other's independence. Both are offered favorable loans and grants from the US. Belarus is offered the same.\n\nThat, in my view, is a permanent peace.

Kessler syndrom is a real problem.</p>\n\n<p>The user I was responding to was talking about &quot;50+ years&quot; which is not the case here.</p>\n</div>",

While the single probability of such an event is essentially negligible, you might be giving a non-zero probability of such a thing happening through the sheer amount of debris you would put in LEO. Akin to multiplying zero by infinite, you might get a non-zero finite number.\n\nAdmittedly I haven't checked the latest literature on Kessler syndrome scenarios, but I am highly skeptic that a catastrophic LEO event would subside in just a few years. I would be willing to bet that the effects would be felt in higher orbits, owing to scenarios like the one above. Then you would have increased risks of making further Kessler syndromes if you intersect orbits with high traffic.\n\nAnd this is not even discussing the extremely disruptive effects that disabling LEO would have for life on Earth. Its not only about losing communications and GPS, but also losing key satellites that support modern agriculture and many other things.\n\nThe effects are potentially catastrophic enough that IMO a strong stance should be had against any threats to Space usage by rogue nations. It should be made very clear (ala retaliation scenarios against tactical nukes utilization) that any attempts against Space (be it LEO or higher) will be met with decisive military retaliation, to avoid any more adventurous ideas from the tyrants of this world.",

And Oleg Matveychev, a member of the Duma commission to investigate foreign interference, condemned yesterday's initiative of the Crimean authorities to restrict the movement of men. Dmitry Peskov also commented on this proposal: \"There is no position on the idea of not releasing men from the Russian Federation with \"partial\" mobilization, it is not known that this should be considered.\"\n\n>Sverdlovsk Ombudsman Tatiana Merzlyakova confirmed that the pause in partial mobilization had been extended, and said that until October 12, those called up for mobilization would not be sent to the front. At the same time, the regions are beginning to receive orders for the second wave of mobilization. One of these regions was the Voronezh region. This time it is planned to summon three times fewer Voronezh residents than the first wave. According to Governor Alexander Gusev, mobilization activities will continue after October 10. And in the Southern Urals, fathers with many children will be pushed back to the second stage of mobilization. This instruction was given by Governor Alexei Teksler. Rostov region received a new mobilization plan 8 days after the press service of the governor said that the mobilization task had been completed. In the Kursk region, the first stage of \"partial\" mobilization has also been completed, it has moved to the second stage.\n\n>Instead of \"events are almost completed\" - \"mobilization is in full swing\": the head of Vasileostrovsky district Eduard Ilyin edited his post on the progress of mobilization, noted \"Paper\". On October 7, he reported on his VKontakte page that \"mobilization activities in the district are almost completed.\" On October 10, this publication was changed and now\n\n>The Military Commissariat of Moscow continues to send subpoenas through employers. District councils began to call Muscovites en masse urging them to voluntarily come to military registration and enlistment offices and confirm their category of fitness. The former Pravda plant in Moscow was rounded on conscripts. The most popular military accounting specialties in Moscow during mobilization are motorized rifles. 23 doctors were mobilized in the Chelyabinsk region. In Tyumen and Yaroslavl, mobilized men were escorted to war. And from Serpukhov, buses with mobilized ones departed in two visits (day and night).\n\n>In the Nenets Autonomous Okrug, armor from mobilization will be provided to reindeer herders, said Governor Yuri Bezdudny. And mobilized residents of Komi will be able to receive free legal assistance out of turn. Families of Belgorod residents called up as part of mobilization will be paid 3 thousand rubles for each child. Families of mobilized residents of the Omsk region will be gased.\n\n>The head of the Bagansky district of the Novosibirsk region, Alexander Tarasov, said that he would go to war as a volunteer. And Deputy Prime Minister of the Government of Bashkiria Azat Badranov, who volunteered for Shaimuratov's battalion, spoke about cowards and traitors.\n\n>Mobilized from the Murmansk region ask the governor to give the uniform in size. \"The form was given an old model and 10 sizes larger.\" A resident of Velikie Luki complained to the governor that the mobilized were not given uniforms in Tver. In response, officials reported that \"citizens are provided for everyone.\" Against this background, Bryansk region sent 150 beds and 300 sleeping bags for those mobilized to the Belgorod region. Parents of gymnasts from Chelyabinsk were asked to give gymnastic mats to the mobilized. In the military unit of the Belgorod region, the Chief of Staff and the mobilized argued over the lack of training.\n\n>Petersburgers began to wait with subpoenas from doctors in polyclinics. Thus, a resident of St. Petersburg, who came to the doctor with a complaint about the exacerbation of bronchial asthma in a severe form, was handed a summons for \"partial\" mobilization in the district polyclinic. A resident of Krasnodar Krai was mobilized with diabetes and hypertension. And in the Novosibirsk region, a 50-year-old opposition ex-deputy was taken away for mobilization from the session of the district council. In the Pskov region, a conscript with a bullet in his stomach was drafted into the army: in 2013 he was wounded, but doctors considered the operation to remove the bullet dangerous. Now he has to be mobilized on November 2. In Crimea, despite the announced completion of mobilization, the baby's father brought a summons. In Bashkortostan, a 30-year-old farmer, father of three children Ilnar Nurgaliyev was mobilized. He was on sick leave due to a leg injury, but he was still given a summons and taken into the army. And a mobilized resident of Bashkiria, suffering from epilepsy attacks, returned to his hometown.\n\n>About 600 residents of Primorsky Krai returned home after erroneous mobilization. In total, 7.4 thousand residents have been mobilized in Primorye. The main reason for returns is the state of health or the presence of four or more minor children in the mobilized. According to the governor of the Omsk region Alexander Burkov, a total of only 200 mistakenly mobilized returned home. In particular, a mobilized person with a dependent disabled mother returned home in Maryanovsky district. Three mobilized people were returned home from Kirov.\n\n>Governor of the Omsk region Alexander Burkov shared positive impressions of the military field camp for those mobilized after his visit.\n\n>After the Ministry of Defense criticized the idea of abandoning the New Year holidays to help the mobilized, the authorities of the Rostov region still decided to celebrate the New Year, but to save on decoration and some events.\n\n>The Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation showed how mobilized residents of Siberia and the Urals, as well as Buryatia are preparing to participate in the war. And the first mobilized yesterday left Rybinsk for Yaroslavl - in the regional center they will be trained on the basis of the anti-aircraft missile school until December, and then they must go \"to protect new Russian territories\". At this time, in the 32nd military town of Yekaterinburg, the mobilized people make noise and fight around the clock. Locals complain about them. From there came the news of the death of another mobilized person. Meanwhile, 66 people were baptized at the mobilization point in Novosibirsk.\n\n>Mobilized people who are located on the territory of the Novosibirsk Higher Military Command School will be sent to the territories bordering Ukraine in about a week. A consolidated detachment of mobilized from the Ulyanovsk region, Penza and Bashkortostan was sent to the annexed Crimea. Also, a combined detachment consisting of residents of Mordovia, Ulyanovsk, Saratov, Penza regions went to the training centers of the Southern Military District from Ulyanovsk for combat co-accombatement.\n\n>News about the mobilized and from the combat zone begins to come. Thus, Vladimir Zolkin, recording interviews with Russian prisoners of war, released a video with Yegor Chebotarev, who was mobilized from Lipetsk, who surrendered near Svatovo. In the Sverdlovsk region, it became known about the death of the mobilized Yevgeny Bizyaev in Ukraine, but then the military told his loved ones that the man was wounded and survived. The military registration and enlistment office of Krasnoturyinsk reported that three previously mobilized people were taken home - two of them were wounded, one died. But they don't name exact names.\n\n>In Ukraine, the mobilized father of three children from Bryansk Mglin disappeared. Vasily Kolosov was initially sent to the assembly point in Klintsy, on September 30 - to the Belgorod region, and from there on October 1 - near Liman, then communication with him disappeared.\n\n>The court in Perm denied Alexei Chupin, a lawsuit against the military registration and enlistment office, who sent him to war without a medical commission.\n\n>In Buryatia, the pets of the mobilized can wait for owners in shelters. Organizations from Ulan-Ude, Severobaikalsk, Tarbagataysky and Ivolginsky districts are ready to provide such assistance. The stay of animals in shelters for the period of mobilization of citizens will be free of charge.\n\n>In Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug, mobilized people were banned from communicating with journalists.\n\n>At Pulkovo airport, a female dentist who has the rank of junior lieutenant was refused to leave the country: about 15 years ago she studied at a medical university, and after graduation she was given a military ID along with her diploma.",

Families of mobilized residents of the Omsk region will be gased.</p>\n\n<p>The head of the Bagansky district of the Novosibirsk region, Alexander Tarasov, said that he would go to war as a volunteer. And Deputy Prime Minister of the Government of Bashkiria Azat Badranov, who volunteered for Shaimuratov&#39;s battalion, spoke about cowards and traitors.</p>\n\n<p>Mobilized from the Murmansk region ask the governor to give the uniform in size. &quot;The form was given an old model and 10 sizes larger.&quot; A resident of Velikie Luki complained to the governor that the mobilized were not given uniforms in Tver. In response, officials reported that &quot;citizens are provided for everyone.&quot; Against this background, Bryansk region sent 150 beds and 300 sleeping bags for those mobilized to the Belgorod region. Parents of gymnasts from Chelyabinsk were asked to give gymnastic mats to the mobilized. In the military unit of the Belgorod region, the Chief of Staff and the mobilized argued over the lack of training.</p>\n\n<p>Petersburgers began to wait with subpoenas from doctors in polyclinics. Thus, a resident of St. Petersburg, who came to the doctor with a complaint about the exacerbation of bronchial asthma in a severe form, was handed a summons for &quot;partial&quot; mobilization in the district polyclinic. A resident of Krasnodar Krai was mobilized with diabetes and hypertension. And in the Novosibirsk region, a 50-year-old opposition ex-deputy was taken away for mobilization from the session of the district council. In the Pskov region, a conscript with a bullet in his stomach was drafted into the army: in 2013 he was wounded, but doctors considered the operation to remove the bullet dangerous. Now he has to be mobilized on November 2. In Crimea, despite the announced completion of mobilization, the baby&#39;s father brought a summons. In Bashkortostan, a 30-year-old farmer, father of three children Ilnar Nurgaliyev was mobilized. He was on sick leave due to a leg injury, but he was still given a summons and taken into the army. And a mobilized resident of Bashkiria, suffering from epilepsy attacks, returned to his hometown.</p>\n\n<p>About 600 residents of Primorsky Krai returned home after erroneous mobilization. In total, 7.4 thousand residents have been mobilized in Primorye. The main reason for returns is the state of health or the presence of four or more minor children in the mobilized. According to the governor of the Omsk region Alexander Burkov, a total of only 200 mistakenly mobilized returned home. In particular, a mobilized person with a dependent disabled mother returned home in Maryanovsky district. Three mobilized people were returned home from Kirov.</p>\n\n<p>Governor of the Omsk region Alexander Burkov shared positive impressions of the military field camp for those mobilized after his visit.</p>\n\n<p>After the Ministry of Defense criticized the idea of abandoning the New Year holidays to help the mobilized, the authorities of the Rostov region still decided to celebrate the New Year, but to save on decoration and some events.</p>\n\n<p>The Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation showed how mobilized residents of Siberia and the Urals, as well as Buryatia are preparing to participate in the war. And the first mobilized yesterday left Rybinsk for Yaroslavl - in the regional center they will be trained on the basis of the anti-aircraft missile school until December, and then they must go &quot;to protect new Russian territories&quot;. At this time, in the 32nd military town of Yekaterinburg, the mobilized people make noise and fight around the clock. Locals complain about them. From there came the news of the death of another mobilized person. Meanwhile, 66 people were baptized at the mobilization point in Novosibirsk.</p>\n\n<p>Mobilized people who are located on the territory of the Novosibirsk Higher Military Command School will be sent to the territories bordering Ukraine in about a week. A consolidated detachment of mobilized from the Ulyanovsk region, Penza and Bashkortostan was sent to the annexed Crimea. Also, a combined detachment consisting of residents of Mordovia, Ulyanovsk, Saratov, Penza regions went to the training centers of the Southern Military District from Ulyanovsk for combat co-accombatement.</p>\n\n<p>News about the mobilized and from the combat zone begins to come. Thus, Vladimir Zolkin, recording interviews with Russian prisoners of war, released a video with Yegor Chebotarev, who was mobilized from Lipetsk, who surrendered near Svatovo. In the Sverdlovsk region, it became known about the death of the mobilized Yevgeny Bizyaev in Ukraine, but then the military told his loved ones that the man was wounded and survived. The military registration and enlistment office of Krasnoturyinsk reported that three previously mobilized people were taken home - two of them were wounded, one died. But they don&#39;t name exact names.</p>\n\n<p>In Ukraine, the mobilized father of three children from Bryansk Mglin disappeared. Vasily Kolosov was initially sent to the assembly point in Klintsy, on September 30 - to the Belgorod region, and from there on October 1 - near Liman, then communication with him disappeared.</p>\n\n<p>The court in Perm denied Alexei Chupin, a lawsuit against the military registration and enlistment office, who sent him to war without a medical commission.</p>\n\n<p>In Buryatia, the pets of the mobilized can wait for owners in shelters. Organizations from Ulan-Ude, Severobaikalsk, Tarbagataysky and Ivolginsky districts are ready to provide such assistance. The stay of animals in shelters for the period of mobilization of citizens will be free of charge.</p>\n\n<p>In Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug, mobilized people were banned from communicating with journalists.</p>\n\n<p>At Pulkovo airport, a female dentist who has the rank of junior lieutenant was refused to leave the country: about 15 years ago she studied at a medical university, and after graduation she was given a military ID along with her diploma.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

            "body": "Hungarian here. This might not be credibledefense related, but since we are part of NATO and all of us know the \"issues\" with hungary, to the level that NATO/US intelligence does not trust ours with sensitive information. I think it is benefical to provide a bit of domestic info. Mods, please tell me if thia should be removed.\n\nNote - this is a viewpoint of a civilian with university education, but can be often meet within the capital (only place where opposition still holds power)\n\nOur current regime (and if you look at our history, since we lost our royal bloodline, we are switching one regime after another, dont really seems to work well with democracy ... I am talking about 500+ years) owns a large amount of media. They are heavily pro-russians (we dint know if they hoped that Ukraine will collapse and they might get some territories back like between ww1-ww2 or they just want cheap gas and a card that they can play in the EU, playing both sides) and state owned media reaches exclusively around 75% of the population here. I mean radio, TV, internet is not that widespread in villages and people who use it might know a few webpages and doesnt have the netculture developed outside of the capital really (so like - I saw it in facebook, must be true...). Of course, goverment has sizeable voice in the net as well.\n\nErgo:\n\nMany hungarians have feed on this propaganda and their opinion has been formed by it. The state also continously spend relatively large amount of money to keep the narrative of \"everything that is wrong is the fault of the opposition, Soros and Brussel. (Ignoring the fact that they are leading the country for more then 12 years straight).\n\nI am sorry to report, but state capture is complete in Hungary. Media, Court, Financial and Police sector, Education (goverment sanctioned and written History books only, and every other school books actually. We had very good education, it is pretty bad now and it is going down). Govermental bodies etc.\n\nIt is well known that you shouldnt grow your business to large cause state elite will literally buy it from you in a lower price (if you resist the offer, you will be constantly be bothere with taxes, accidents and worst, until the business collapses).\n\nOur internal affairs minister is a well known maffia member.\n\nIt isnt as bad as in Belarus, but we are at the end of the process of a slow state capture built not on hard power (police taking people from the street like Belarus or russia), but an army of possible soft pressure points and ability to promote your buisness, rewrite laws and constitution as needed, borders of the voting districts, having billions on your campaign, while the opposition has much less.

This might not be credibledefense related, but since we are part of NATO and all of us know the &quot;issues&quot; with hungary, to the level that NATO/US intelligence does not trust ours with sensitive information. I think it is benefical to provide a bit of domestic info. Mods, please tell me if thia should be removed.</p>\n\n<p>Note - this is a viewpoint of a civilian with university education, but can be often meet within the capital (only place where opposition still holds power)</p>\n\n<p>Our current regime (and if you look at our history, since we lost our royal bloodline, we are switching one regime after another, dont really seems to work well with democracy ... I am talking about 500+ years) owns a large amount of media. They are heavily pro-russians (we dint know if they hoped that Ukraine will collapse and they might get some territories back like between ww1-ww2 or they just want cheap gas and a card that they can play in the EU, playing both sides) and state owned media reaches exclusively around 75% of the population here. I mean radio, TV, internet is not that widespread in villages and people who use it might know a few webpages and doesnt have the netculture developed outside of the capital really (so like - I saw it in facebook, must be true...). Of course, goverment has sizeable voice in the net as well.</p>\n\n<p>Ergo:</p>\n\n<p>Many hungarians have feed on this propaganda and their opinion has been formed by it. The state also continously spend relatively large amount of money to keep the narrative of &quot;everything that is wrong is the fault of the opposition, Soros and Brussel. (Ignoring the fact that they are leading the country for more then 12 years straight).</p>\n\n<p>I am sorry to report, but state capture is complete in Hungary. Media, Court, Financial and Police sector, Education (goverment sanctioned and written History books only, and every other school books actually. We had very good education, it is pretty bad now and it is going down). Govermental bodies etc.</p>\n\n<p>It is well known that you shouldnt grow your business to large cause state elite will literally buy it from you in a lower price (if you resist the offer, you will be constantly be bothere with taxes, accidents and worst, until the business collapses).</p>\n\n<p>Our internal affairs minister is a well known maffia member.</p>\n\n<p>It isnt as bad as in Belarus, but we are at the end of the process of a slow state capture built not on hard power (police taking people from the street like Belarus or russia), but an army of possible soft pressure points and ability to promote your buisness, rewrite laws and constitution as needed, borders of the voting districts, having billions on your campaign, while the opposition has much less.

Less money for Iran means less money for weapons, less money for proxies and less money for military adventures.

Some members spoke about atrocities but in the end the majority hasn't condemned those atrocities, but often they approved it (until the last years of the party).\n\nYou could say the same was (and is) true for the fascist party, approving every fascist dictatorship around the world (argentina, etc.)\n\nSo, what do they want, represent, etc?\n\nThey were/are simply against the system. They wanted a communist/fascist revolution, or at least a collapse of the actual system, so anything that would weaken the Italian political/economical system of those times was good. If USSR made something that would hurt US, UK and the system of alliances of Italy, that was good because in their mind that would mean weaken Italy's political system at the time and so \"more room to win\" for them.\n\nIn short, for this kind of people, that could be the communist party in italy, some labourists in the UK, this tulsi gabard in the US or other politicians, the enemy must win so the current political system/alliances loses, and so they can revert the system.\n\nOf course the enemies of democracies exploit these people (a term was coined: useful idiots) to try to break democracies from within.\n\nIt is not weird that often these parties are payed/infiltrated by foreign agents of dictatorships, because they are useful to them.\n\nIn the 80s there was the \"euromissile crisis\", when the USSR deployed nuclear weapons that could heavily threat Europe, so Reagan responded installing Pershings. Many european countries (especially italy) had large \"pro-peace\" rallies against these pershings, asking for \"unilateral disarmament\". USSR of course [tried to infiltrate/pay](https://ilmanifesto.it/craxi-berlinguer-e-gli-euromissili-da-li-la-fine-della-guerra-fredda) these movements (use the translation).\n\nAnother interesting fact concerns the current ukraine war. In the 60s/70s, many communists were obviously anti-vietnam war protesters, yankee go home and all this stuff. In italy there was even a fund to pay the weapons for vietcong resistance. These same people (those who are still alive), today call for the complete stop of the flow of weapons to ukraine from western allies.

                "body": "Yes, no, and sort of. This is a superficial read on what happened and I suppose we're getting outside the scope of the sub. But ULA and Boeing are private companies. Boeing's troubles with Starliner look a lot like their troubles with 737MAX. Which is to say, Jack Welch's legacy, one of the most private sector outcomes there is.\n\nBlue Origin is a very well resourced and very private company, yet has it put anything in space? Armadillo? Scaled Composites? Virgin? Starchaser? XCOR? Reaction Engines?\n\nThe revolution in space launch hasn't been driven by tycoons or the private sector, *it's just SpaceX*. SpaceX have overtaken the rest of humanity put together, while all other new-space efforts put together have only slightly surpassed hobbyists. SpaceX is one of those once-in-a-lifetime things that ought to be mined for lessons for years, and those lessons are not: free markets and billionaires fix everything. Because the launch market was free for a long time without anything getting fixed. And many a rich person has jumped in, floundered around, and given up. Not to mention, Musk was not especially rich when he started SpaceX, it was started on a relative shoestring and grew under its own power (sort of).\n\n> *In one sentence: NASA acted as a highly informed and involved investor / incubator to a tech startup with just the right combination of culture, talent, and luck, to reach a point where it could benefit from their technology transfer programs then grow on its own.*\n\nNot to belabour this, but launch was already private and it was expensive and slow. A dozen other private startups tried and failed to do anything but burn money. What changed was the right person put together the right team around the same time that NASA changed how it interacted with the private sector. SpaceX had a highly motivated engineer with a liberal tech startup management style holding the purse strings, and NASA behind them with a ton of hard learned lessons to pass on, and business to give them when they proved out each capability. That, as far as I could see, was the recipe. That and an industry *ripe* for a revolution.\n\nPerhaps we should say old-space was public-private, but done wrong.

                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Yes, no, and sort of. This is a superficial read on what happened and I suppose we&#39;re getting outside the scope of the sub. But ULA and Boeing are private companies. Boeing&#39;s troubles with Starliner look a lot like their troubles with 737MAX. Which is to say, Jack Welch&#39;s legacy, one of the most private sector outcomes there is.</p>\n\n<p>Blue Origin is a very well resourced and very private company, yet has it put anything in space? Armadillo? Scaled Composites? Virgin? Starchaser? XCOR? Reaction Engines?</p>\n\n<p>The revolution in space launch hasn&#39;t been driven by tycoons or the private sector, <em>it&#39;s just SpaceX</em>. SpaceX have overtaken the rest of humanity put together, while all other new-space efforts put together have only slightly surpassed hobbyists. SpaceX is one of those once-in-a-lifetime things that ought to be mined for lessons for years, and those lessons are not: free markets and billionaires fix everything. Because the launch market was free for a long time without anything getting fixed. And many a rich person has jumped in, floundered around, and given up. Not to mention, Musk was not especially rich when he started SpaceX, it was started on a relative shoestring and grew under its own power (sort of).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>In one sentence: NASA acted as a highly informed and involved investor / incubator to a tech startup with just the right combination of culture, talent, and luck, to reach a point where it could benefit from their technology transfer programs then grow on its own.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Not to belabour this, but launch was already private and it was expensive and slow. A dozen other private startups tried and failed to do anything but burn money. What changed was the right person put together the right team around the same time that NASA changed how it interacted with the private sector. SpaceX had a highly motivated engineer with a liberal tech startup management style holding the purse strings, and NASA behind them with a ton of hard learned lessons to pass on, and business to give them when they proved out each capability. That, as far as I could see, was the recipe. That and an industry <em>ripe</em> for a revolution.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps we should say old-space was public-private, but done wrong. Whereas SpaceX is public-private, but done right.</p>\n\n<p>Though there&#39;s a lot of lightning-in-a-bottle as well, more startups have followed with only modest successes, despite investors throwing money at them in SpaceX&#39;s wake. Apologies for the essay, this topic has among the the most infuriating ratios of importance to public understanding.

Note that the engagement range of the hellfire is 10km. \n\nA helicopter is used in a few profiles including a gunship, CAS, loitering, short-range engagement, and tank busting. Along with carrying personnel if possible. Thus the carry weight, number of hard points, and external guidance systems are optimised for this. You also have dumb rockets on them for close engagement. It\u2019s also much more vulnerable to MANPADS and SAMs. \n\nHIMARS has a fundamentally different application - precision strikes in sub 100km range. GMLRS is gps guided s2s with sub 100km range. The ATACMS of course changes this completely, turning it into a 300km precision surface to surface munition. \n\nBut if you want to hit something 300km away and want to do it from the air, plenty of fixed wing aircraft exist that can carry a larger number of missiles and guide them from the air far better than a helicopter can, strike aircraft being optimised for this very purpose, and including the ability to launch cruise missiles too with whatever guidance you have.  Flying that quick you can also simply drop GBUs. \n\nSo it doesn\u2019t make for a good use case for a helicopter to perform a task it wasn\u2019t quite designed for, where it would carry very few rockets and not have systems optimised for their delivery and be a rather easy target. \n\nThis is why Russia is using Backfires to launch its cruise missiles. For example it can carry 10 Kh-15 A2S missiles with active radar homing and a 300km range, or 4 Kh-42s with a purported 1000km+ range, or as is currently being used the Blackjack can carry 12 Kh-101s with a 600-3000(?)

The first I will give him, even though I didn't hear Zelensky myself.  The second, that Chechen barrier troops don't exist can't be proven, because as everybody has been saying ad nauseum, proving non-existence is tricky.

No, you arent.\n\nAnd then we get to point 3 where he insists that Russian troops are convinced by his arguments about the absence of Chechen barrier troops while Zelensky has been deluded by his own propaganda into thinking they Do exist.  If that is true, he should be able to come up with some evidence.  Or at least a compelling anecdote.  That isn't asking him to \"prove a negative\".

The first I will give him, even though I didn&#39;t hear Zelensky myself.  The second, that Chechen barrier troops don&#39;t exist can&#39;t be proven, because as everybody has been saying ad nauseum, proving non-existence is tricky. But are you all over him about how he posited that his arguments show that Chechen barrier troops don&#39;t exist? No, you arent.</p>\n\n<p>And then we get to point 3 where he insists that Russian troops are convinced by his arguments about the absence of Chechen barrier troops while Zelensky has been deluded by his own propaganda into thinking they Do exist.  If that is true, he should be able to come up with some evidence.  Or at least a compelling anecdote.  That isn&#39;t asking him to &quot;prove a negative&quot;. And in fact the only anecdote he does provide, that Russians think that all Chechens are terrorists, would tend to disprove his contention that no Russian soldier would ever believe such a thing.</p>\n\n<p>Thats my last word to anyone, no matter how many people decide its beneficial to just shout &quot;thats drivel&quot; with zero mental effort.</p>\n\n<p>Mods, I sincerely apologize for thinking that I could point out a logical flaw in an argument without starting a useless thread of biblical proportions.</p>\n</div>",

Aftermath of retreats from battles disproves it.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s nonsense.</p>\n\n<p>I also never argued that a Russian soldier thought it obvious there are no repercussions for terminating contracts, you are simply inventing what I did not say and having a conversation with yourself.</p>\n\n<p>And again diverting from the point you just argued that you have evidence that it\u2019s more likely that it is true. \u201cThey\u2019d be scared therefore it happened\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Now you\u2019re saying \u201cwell I don\u2019t have any information on that and frankly, you don\u2019t seem to either\u201d</p>\n\n<p>So your argument is, well I can\u2019t prove it and i claim you can\u2019t therefore it is true.</p>\n\n<p>Well done.</p>\n</div>",

The goal was to replaced the dual-purpose improved conventional munition (DPICM) of the original M30 rocket, which is anti-armor with a secondary fragmentation effect. Being that cluster munitions aren't *cool* the Alternative Warhead(AW) program was created. The M30A1 and M30A2 use tungsten for the same reason it's used in armor piercing munitions, it's very dense and retains more energy allowing for deeper penetration. While the M30A1/M30A2 is a piss poor replacement for the M30/DPICM it is still designed to do the same job, destroy soft-skinned vehicles, penetrate armored vehicles through the weakest point(the roof), and cause causalities to infantry in the open. \n\nCompared to the M795, the US standard 155mm round capable of being fired from any NATO 155mm gun, you will get far less penetration. So long as it's using the standard M732 fuze set for airburst(adjustable from 1 to 4 meter HOB). The body of the M795 is forged from high fragmentation(HF1) steel, which then goes through a proprietary heat treatment. [This is a simulation of a M795 fuzed for airburst](https://i.imgur.com/HVd6zmy.png) at 50us, 100us, and 150us. The front begins to fragment first as that is where the fuze sits, when fuzed for airburst you're left with thousands of tiny steel fragments.  Steel has less than have the density of tungsten, when propelled to the same speed tungsten will travel and/or penetrate further. While the M795 is quite modern, artillery shells since WW1 have been designed to airburst as artillery is mainly designed to kill infantry. \n\nRegardless, **it is a terrible idea to fire more artillery at a nuclear power plant**.",

While the M30A1/M30A2 is a piss poor replacement for the M30/DPICM it is still designed to do the same job, destroy soft-skinned vehicles, penetrate armored vehicles through the weakest point(the roof), and cause causalities to infantry in the open. </p>\n\n<p>Compared to the M795, the US standard 155mm round capable of being fired from any NATO 155mm gun, you will get far less penetration. So long as it&#39;s using the standard M732 fuze set for airburst(adjustable from 1 to 4 meter HOB). The body of the M795 is forged from high fragmentation(HF1) steel, which then goes through a proprietary heat treatment. <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/HVd6zmy.png\">This is a simulation of a M795 fuzed for airburst</a> at 50us, 100us, and 150us. The front begins to fragment first as that is where the fuze sits, when fuzed for airburst you&#39;re left with thousands of tiny steel fragments.  Steel has less than have the density of tungsten, when propelled to the same speed tungsten will travel and/or penetrate further. While the M795 is quite modern, artillery shells since WW1 have been designed to airburst as artillery is mainly designed to kill infantry. </p>\n\n<p>Regardless, <strong>it is a terrible idea to fire more artillery at a nuclear power plant</strong>.</p>\n</div>",

However, even if that number were 90%, who is going to report radar losses? These will be the most secured Russian equipment pieces, so you won't have bloggers on site to record the losses. \n\n2. The missiles continue in their path as accurately as they can if they lose lock on. It's totally possible that a HARMs missile was fired and the radar immediately turned off, and it hit a nearby house within 100m of the last known location. \n\n3. Your comment is very presumptuous about so-called constant HARMs failures. I expect better sourcing (and don't link bomb me, I cant tell a HARMs from a rocket, a single piece by a usually trusted analyst would be great though) for such a claim. Otherwise, it's hard to analyze further.",
