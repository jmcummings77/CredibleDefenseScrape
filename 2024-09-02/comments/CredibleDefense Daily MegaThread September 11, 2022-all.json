Priorities will likely remain the North bank of the Dnipro river above Nova Kavokha (in order to protect the Crimean canal), the pre-war Luhansk and Donetsk independent regions and the M14 corridor that connect Kherson, and Crimea with the Donbass. Any incursion by Ukraine into these territories will be a sign that Russia has lost the ability to contest ground it prioritises.\n5.

If the Russians do not reinforce Luhansk then Ukraine may attempt to cross the Oskil river and push the eastern flank back to pre-war lines.\n6. Politically Russia is now in a dilemma, their soft power is ineffectual on the west and they are fighting a hugely expensive war they cannot win against a highly motivated enemy that is only growing stronger, eventually something will give. Pragmatically Russia should cut its losses now but that is politically impossible. My prediction is that Putin will cut resources to his forces whilst publicly demanding they fight allowing him to blame the military when they are defeated.

Or the Palestinians who have been living in under an apartheid system for almost a century now, and they still haven&#39;t given up the fight.</p>\n\n<p>Even ISIS seemed brave, which was mostly a bunch of thugs versus basically the whole world (where even geopolitical enemies were united against them). A group so hated and despised that when countries wanted to mudsling each other, they&#39;d claim the other was supporting ISIS.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, a bunch of nobodies flying a plane into the world trade centers were very brave. Tbh, in general, suicide bombers are probably some of the bravest people.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously Taliban and ISIS are shit, but they were brave. How brave would Ukranians be if Russia AND NATO together were attacking them, while sanctioning them, while using global media to attack them?

I think that in the long term, this will result in continued Russian control of Crimea that will eventually be recognized by the rest the world, because Russia won&#39;t respond to any diplomatic efforts.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I have generally thought that the second option was more likely to occur. But the further Russia moves towards losing the war without making any serious efforts to end it, the more likely option one becomes, and if the next month or so go well for Ukraine I don&#39;t think Ukraine will have any real incentive to let Russia continue to control Crimea.</p>\n</div>",

They're effectively all that Russia has.\n\nRussia has a large number of personnel in the Strategic Missiles / Aerospace / Naval forces. Just before the invasion, it had a mere \\~360,000 men serving in the land forces (i.e., Army + Marines + VDV).\n\nSaid \\~360,000 men are about 2/3 officers and kontraktniki and 1/3 conscripts. Thus, the effective deployable strength of Russia, prior to the invasion, was a mere \\~240,000 men. Note that some of these men, whether officers or specialists, were used as cadre to conscript battalions.\n\nThus, when Russia invaded with \\~150,000 regular ground troops, it used roughly 2/3 of its total deployable force. Additional units have been sent as reinforcements since then, and the conscript battalions have been raided of their officers and specialists to serve either as individual replacements or to staff the newly-raised volunteer battalions.\n\nTaken altogether, I wouldn't be surprised if \\~200,000 of Russia's initial standing force of \\~240,000 deployable soldiers have set foot in Ukraine at some point since February.\n\nIn terms of trained manpower, Russia is effectively tapped out. Worse, it has cannibalized the cadre with which it could, to a certain extent, absorb conscripts in the event of general mobilization.",

Thus, the effective deployable strength of Russia, prior to the invasion, was a mere ~240,000 men. Note that some of these men, whether officers or specialists, were used as cadre to conscript battalions.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, when Russia invaded with ~150,000 regular ground troops, it used roughly 2/3 of its total deployable force. Additional units have been sent as reinforcements since then, and the conscript battalions have been raided of their officers and specialists to serve either as individual replacements or to staff the newly-raised volunteer battalions.</p>\n\n<p>Taken altogether, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if ~200,000 of Russia&#39;s initial standing force of ~240,000 deployable soldiers have set foot in Ukraine at some point since February.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of trained manpower, Russia is effectively tapped out. Worse, it has cannibalized the cadre with which it could, to a certain extent, absorb conscripts in the event of general mobilization.</p>\n</div>",

There's a lot of degrees in which it could happen.\n\nFirst of all you should not stare at the headline numbers of soldiers; most of the \"full mobilization\" in Ukraine is actually less about having ordinary men with guns, and more about an immense number of civilians volunteering in the logistics chain (both humanitarian and military). This is something that Russia doesn't currently really need that much with its force posture. And, well, Russian civilians are not the ones needing humanitarian support, so that entire part of the mobilization is unnecessary.\n\nRussia could increase its forces to some extent by drafting people. But there, they would have some clear limits: first, the number of field officers (most Russian officers are specialists or office workers, not the ones commanding troops), and second, the number of serviceable/logistically supportable tanks, artillery pieces, and other vehicles (this is probably already a challenge for Russia with the current forces).  It can probably generate light infantry out of any reservist, but light infantry stops being useful if it can't be supported by sufficient heavy equipment, so their need for these is limited.\n\nThen the amount of heavy equipment on the battlefield could only really be substantially increased by transitioning to a wartime economy and converting civilian capabilities to that end. But it takes years to convert factories (assuming it's like for USA in WW2) and probably actually longer because of how complicated modern military hardware is.

They own everything that happened after Feb 24.\n\nWhat of the military impact? Minimal at first, but if the strikes continue, it may cause serious issues. The challenge will be to what extent the military will aid the civilian population. Without electricity, the world stops. No trains, no lights, no running water, no food, nothing. Of course the military needs will be prioritized, and I don't think we'll see the Ukrainian army resorting to horse drawn carriages. But for the millions of civilians in the big cities, the political leadership will have to make a choice: humanitarian aid for the people, or continuing military logistics for the front.
