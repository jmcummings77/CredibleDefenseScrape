For one thing, the area around Avdiivka is *much* more heavily fortified than anything the Ukrainians had in place around Bakhmut.

For what it's worth, Ukraine has continued to slowly take ground in Zaporizhzhia (as well as the Bakhmut and Kupyansk fronts) even with Russia's Avdiivka offensive ongoing. \n\nAs I've noted elsewhere, the Ukrainian summer offensive was a clear failure. It didn't come close to achieving its stated objectives, let alone the massive hype the Ukrainians tried to play up. But it did, however, result in some tangible gains for Ukraine, caused significant attrition to Russian forces, especially some of their last remaining elite formations, and it left Ukraine in a position of being able to continue to make advances even while effectively holding off a simultaneous Russian offensive. The real question is how much ammo does Ukraine have left, and what does their timeline for resupply look like.",

The Russians lines weren&#39;t even close to breaking and plenty of reserves were available.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The objective seems pretty clear to me, keep grinding away at Russian forces while trying to bring offensive tempo to a sustainable pace and maintain the initiative. For what it&#39;s worth, Ukraine has continued to slowly take ground in Zaporizhzhia (as well as the Bakhmut and Kupyansk fronts) even with Russia&#39;s Avdiivka offensive ongoing. </p>\n\n<p>As I&#39;ve noted elsewhere, the Ukrainian summer offensive was a clear failure. It didn&#39;t come close to achieving its stated objectives, let alone the massive hype the Ukrainians tried to play up. But it did, however, result in some tangible gains for Ukraine, caused significant attrition to Russian forces, especially some of their last remaining elite formations, and it left Ukraine in a position of being able to continue to make advances even while effectively holding off a simultaneous Russian offensive. The real question is how much ammo does Ukraine have left, and what does their timeline for resupply look like.</p>\n</div>",

The assault on democracy by a morally sick imperial power in the heart of Europe has tilted the balance of power in other parts of the world, including the Middle East and Asia-Pacific. The failure of multilateral bodies such as the un and Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe to maintain order means that Ukraine can only restore its territorial integrity by military force.  \n>  \n>Ukrainians have shown their willingness to lay down soul and body for their freedom. Ukraine not only halted an invasion by a far stronger enemy but liberated much of its territory. However, the war is now moving to a new stage: what we in the military call \u201cpositional\u201d warfare of static and attritional fighting, as in the first world war, in contrast to the \u201cmanoeuvre\u201d warfare of movement and speed. This will benefit Russia, allowing it to rebuild its military power, eventually threatening Ukraine\u2019s armed forces and the state itself. What is the way out?  \n>  \n>Basic weapons, such as missiles and shells, remain essential. But Ukraine\u2019s armed forces need key military capabilities and technologies to break out of this kind of war. The most important one is air power. Control of the skies is essential to large-scale ground operations. At the start of the war we had 120 warplanes. Of these, only one-third were usable.  \n>  \n>Russia\u2019s air force has taken huge losses and we have destroyed over 550 of its air-defence systems, but it maintains a significant advantage over us and continues to build new attack squadrons. That advantage has made it harder for us to advance. Russia\u2019s air-defence systems increasingly prevent our planes from flying. Our defences do the same to Russia. So Russian drones have taken over a large part of the role of manned aviation in terms of reconnaissance and air strikes.  \n>  \n>Drones must be part of our answer, too. Ukraine needs to conduct massive strikes using decoy and attack drones to overload Russia\u2019s air-defence systems. We need to hunt down Russian drones using our own hunter drones equipped with nets. We must use signal-emitting decoys to attract Russian glide bombs. And we need to blind Russian drones\u2019 thermal cameras at night using stroboscopes.  \n>  \n>This points to our second priority: electronic warfare (ew), such as jamming communication and navigation signals. EW is the key to victory in the drone war. Russia modernised its ew forces over the past decade, creating a new branch of its army and building 60 new types of equipment. It outdoes us in this area: 65% of our jamming platforms at the start of the war were produced in Soviet times.  \n>  \n>We have already built many of our own electronic protection systems, which can prevent jamming. But we also need more access to electronic intelligence from our allies, including data from assets that collect signals intelligence, and expanded production lines for our anti-drone ew systems within Ukraine and abroad. We need to get better at conducting electronic warfare from our drones, across a wider range of the radio spectrum, while avoiding accidental suppression of our own drones.  \n>  \n>The third task is counter-battery fire: defeating enemy artillery. In this war, as in most past wars, artillery, rocket and missile fire make up 60-80% of all the military tasks. When we first received Western guns last year, we were quite successful at locating and striking Russian artillery. But the effectiveness of weapons such as Excalibur, a gps-guided American shell, has declined dramatically owing to improved Russian electronic warfare.  \n>  \n>Meanwhile, Russia\u2019s own counter-battery fire has improved. This is largely thanks to its use of Lancet loitering munitions, which work alongside reconnaissance drones, and its increasing production of precision-guided shells that can be aimed by ground spotters. Despite the dismissive view of some military analysts, we cannot belittle the effectiveness of Russian weapons and intelligence in this regard.  \n>  \n>For now, we have managed to achieve parity with Russia through a smaller quantity of more accurate firepower. But this may not last. We need to build up our local gps fields\u2014using ground-based antennas rather than just satellites\u2014to make our precision-guided shells more accurate in the face of Russian jamming. We need to make greater use of kamikaze drones to strike Russian artillery. And we need our partners to send us better artillery-reconnaissance equipment that can locate Russian guns.  \n>  \n>The fourth task is mine-breaching technology. We had limited and outdated equipment for this at the start of the war. But even Western supplies, such as Norwegian mine-clearing tanks and rocket-powered mine-clearing devices, have proved insufficient given the scale of Russian minefields, which stretch back 20km in places. When we do breach minefields, Russia quickly replenishes them by firing new mines from a distance.  \n>  \n>Technology is the answer. We need radar-like sensors that use invisible pulses of light to detect mines in the ground and smoke-projection systems to conceal the activities of our de-mining units. We can use jet engines from decommissioned aircraft, water cannons or cluster munitions to breach mine barriers without digging into the ground. New types of tunnel excavators, such as a robot which uses plasma torches to bore tunnels, can also help.  \n>  \n>My fifth and final priority is to build up our reserves. Russia has failed to capitalise on its hefty manpower advantage because Vladimir Putin is worried that a general mobilisation might spark a political crisis, and because Russia cannot train and equip enough people. However, our capacity to train reserves on our own territory is also limited. We cannot easily spare soldiers who are deployed to the front. Moreover, Russia can strike training centres. And there are gaps in our legislation that allow citizens to evade their responsibilities.  \n>  \n>We are trying to fix these problems. We are introducing a unified register of draftees, and we must expand the category of citizens who can be called up for training or mobilisation. We are also introducing a \u201ccombat internship\u201d, which involves placing newly mobilised and trained personnel in experienced front-line units to prepare them.  \n>  \n>Russia should not be underestimated. It has suffered heavy losses and expended a lot of ammunition. But it will have superiority in weapons, equipment, missiles and ammunition for a considerable time. Its defence industry is increasing its output, despite unprecedented sanctions. Our nato partners are dramatically increasing their production capacity, too. But it takes at least a year to do this and, in some cases, such as aircraft and command-and-control systems, two years.  \n>  \n>A positional war is a prolonged one that carries enormous risks to Ukraine\u2019s armed forces and to its state. If Ukraine is to escape from that trap, we will need all these things: air superiority, much-improved electronic-warfare and counter-battery capabilities, new mine-breaching technology and the ability to mobilise and train more reserves. We also need to focus on modern command and control\u2014so we can visualise the battlefield more effectively than Russia and make decisions more quickly\u2014and on rationalising our logistics while disrupting Russia\u2019s with longer-range missiles. New, innovative approaches can turn this war of position back into one of manoeuvre.\n\n[https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2023/11/01/the-commander-in-chief-of-ukraines-armed-forces-on-what-he-needs-to-beat-russia](https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2023/11/01/the-commander-in-chief-of-ukraines-armed-forces-on-what-he-needs-to-beat-russia)",

It outdoes us in this area: 65% of our jamming platforms at the start of the war were produced in Soviet times.  </p>\n\n<p>We have already built many of our own electronic protection systems, which can prevent jamming. But we also need more access to electronic intelligence from our allies, including data from assets that collect signals intelligence, and expanded production lines for our anti-drone ew systems within Ukraine and abroad. We need to get better at conducting electronic warfare from our drones, across a wider range of the radio spectrum, while avoiding accidental suppression of our own drones.  </p>\n\n<p>The third task is counter-battery fire: defeating enemy artillery. In this war, as in most past wars, artillery, rocket and missile fire make up 60-80% of all the military tasks. When we first received Western guns last year, we were quite successful at locating and striking Russian artillery. But the effectiveness of weapons such as Excalibur, a gps-guided American shell, has declined dramatically owing to improved Russian electronic warfare.  </p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Russia\u2019s own counter-battery fire has improved. This is largely thanks to its use of Lancet loitering munitions, which work alongside reconnaissance drones, and its increasing production of precision-guided shells that can be aimed by ground spotters. Despite the dismissive view of some military analysts, we cannot belittle the effectiveness of Russian weapons and intelligence in this regard.  </p>\n\n<p>For now, we have managed to achieve parity with Russia through a smaller quantity of more accurate firepower. But this may not last. We need to build up our local gps fields\u2014using ground-based antennas rather than just satellites\u2014to make our precision-guided shells more accurate in the face of Russian jamming. We need to make greater use of kamikaze drones to strike Russian artillery. And we need our partners to send us better artillery-reconnaissance equipment that can locate Russian guns.  </p>\n\n<p>The fourth task is mine-breaching technology. We had limited and outdated equipment for this at the start of the war. But even Western supplies, such as Norwegian mine-clearing tanks and rocket-powered mine-clearing devices, have proved insufficient given the scale of Russian minefields, which stretch back 20km in places. When we do breach minefields, Russia quickly replenishes them by firing new mines from a distance.  </p>\n\n<p>Technology is the answer. We need radar-like sensors that use invisible pulses of light to detect mines in the ground and smoke-projection systems to conceal the activities of our de-mining units. We can use jet engines from decommissioned aircraft, water cannons or cluster munitions to breach mine barriers without digging into the ground. New types of tunnel excavators, such as a robot which uses plasma torches to bore tunnels, can also help.  </p>\n\n<p>My fifth and final priority is to build up our reserves. Russia has failed to capitalise on its hefty manpower advantage because Vladimir Putin is worried that a general mobilisation might spark a political crisis, and because Russia cannot train and equip enough people. However, our capacity to train reserves on our own territory is also limited. We cannot easily spare soldiers who are deployed to the front. Moreover, Russia can strike training centres. And there are gaps in our legislation that allow citizens to evade their responsibilities.  </p>\n\n<p>We are trying to fix these problems. We are introducing a unified register of draftees, and we must expand the category of citizens who can be called up for training or mobilisation. We are also introducing a \u201ccombat internship\u201d, which involves placing newly mobilised and trained personnel in experienced front-line units to prepare them.  </p>\n\n<p>Russia should not be underestimated. It has suffered heavy losses and expended a lot of ammunition. But it will have superiority in weapons, equipment, missiles and ammunition for a considerable time. Its defence industry is increasing its output, despite unprecedented sanctions. Our nato partners are dramatically increasing their production capacity, too. But it takes at least a year to do this and, in some cases, such as aircraft and command-and-control systems, two years.  </p>\n\n<p>A positional war is a prolonged one that carries enormous risks to Ukraine\u2019s armed forces and to its state. If Ukraine is to escape from that trap, we will need all these things: air superiority, much-improved electronic-warfare and counter-battery capabilities, new mine-breaching technology and the ability to mobilise and train more reserves. We also need to focus on modern command and control\u2014so we can visualise the battlefield more effectively than Russia and make decisions more quickly\u2014and on rationalising our logistics while disrupting Russia\u2019s with longer-range missiles. New, innovative approaches can turn this war of position back into one of manoeuvre.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2023/11/01/the-commander-in-chief-of-ukraines-armed-forces-on-what-he-needs-to-beat-russia\">https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2023/11/01/the-commander-in-chief-of-ukraines-armed-forces-on-what-he-needs-to-beat-russia</a></p>\n</div>",

        "body": "Don't know why this wasn't posted yesterday or today but \nTatarigami_UA has a pretty good thread on the state of North Korean artillery deliveries to Russia. \n> 1/ After extensive research and analysis of North Korean deliveries to Russia using various sources and calculations, we estimate that Russia has received around 2,000 cargo containers containing over half a million artillery shells. The article link is at the end of this \ud83e\uddf5thread\n\n> 2/ This estimate, which leans toward the conservative side, suggests that the actual number likely surpasses 500,000. These artillery shells encompass predominantly both 152mm and 122mm calibers.\nhttps://twitter.com/Tatarigami_UA/status/1719379856427761688\n\n> 3/ We measured containers, identified types, gathered data on the crates, and used basic mathematical calculations to arrive at what we think is a reliable estimate. To validate our findings, we applied different approaches to calculations and arrived at nearly identical numbers\n\n> 4/ We decided to explore multiple scenarios because we lack precise data on the distribution of delivered ammunition, resulting in our report containing 4 variants. Nevertheless, it's highly likely that at least 50% of the total deliveries consist of 152mm ammunition.\n\n> 5/ The White House confirmed 1,000 container shipments from September to October. October 27th, satellite images show a cargo ship at Rajin port. This proves continuous shipments, extending almost a month beyond the White House's announcement of 1,000 containers in early October.\n\n> 6/ The substantial ammunition supply is a concern for Ukraine, given the war's reliance on artillery. Though there were occasional shortages and decreased artillery fire, Russian forces partially retained their ammunition stocks, now augmented by North Korean deliveries.\n\n> 7/ This also raises questions about whether Russia provided financial support to the cash-strapped North Korean regime or shared other military technologies, potentially affecting the security environment of the Korean peninsula.\n\n> Conclusions:\n\n>The quantity of supplied ammunition is a cause for concern for Ukraine, especially given the war's heavy reliance on artillery. While there have been intermittent shortages and reduced artillery firing rates, the Russian forces still maintained their own stocks of artillery ammunition. Now, these stocks have been bolstered by additional deliveries from North Korea. In the initial phases of the invasion, Russia possessed substantial advantages in terms of ammunition and artillery, which, combined with various other advantages, allowed Russians to occupy significant territories. While this won't provide Russians with a similar level of advantage as the operational environment has changed significantly, this ammo batch can be enough to run another large, or two smaller-scale operations. This will be contrasting with Ukrainian forces which just exhausted a lot of their ammo in the summer counter-offensive.\n\nFull Analysis is here:\nhttps://frontelligence.substack.com/p/counting-the-rounds-north-korean\n\nKofman seems to agree with it.\nhttps://twitter.com/KofmanMichael/status/1719411957969596824\n> Good analysis. Think 500k is a fair and conservative estimate.\n\nAP article today about the same topic.\n> According to lawmaker Yoo Sang-bum, the South Korean National Intelligence Service believes the North shipped more than a million artillery shells to Russia through ships and other transport means since early August to help boost Russia\u2019s warfighting capabilities in Ukraine.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Don&#39;t know why this wasn&#39;t posted yesterday or today but \nTatarigami_UA has a pretty good thread on the state of North Korean artillery deliveries to Russia. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>1/ After extensive research and analysis of North Korean deliveries to Russia using various sources and calculations, we estimate that Russia has received around 2,000 cargo containers containing over half a million artillery shells. The article link is at the end of this \ud83e\uddf5thread</p>\n\n<p>2/ This estimate, which leans toward the conservative side, suggests that the actual number likely surpasses 500,000. These artillery shells encompass predominantly both 152mm and 122mm calibers.\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tatarigami_UA/status/1719379856427761688\">https://twitter.com/Tatarigami_UA/status/1719379856427761688</a></p>\n\n<p>3/ We measured containers, identified types, gathered data on the crates, and used basic mathematical calculations to arrive at what we think is a reliable estimate. To validate our findings, we applied different approaches to calculations and arrived at nearly identical numbers</p>\n\n<p>4/ We decided to explore multiple scenarios because we lack precise data on the distribution of delivered ammunition, resulting in our report containing 4 variants. Nevertheless, it&#39;s highly likely that at least 50% of the total deliveries consist of 152mm ammunition.</p>\n\n<p>5/ The White House confirmed 1,000 container shipments from September to October. October 27th, satellite images show a cargo ship at Rajin port. This proves continuous shipments, extending almost a month beyond the White House&#39;s announcement of 1,000 containers in early October.</p>\n\n<p>6/ The substantial ammunition supply is a concern for Ukraine, given the war&#39;s reliance on artillery. Though there were occasional shortages and decreased artillery fire, Russian forces partially retained their ammunition stocks, now augmented by North Korean deliveries.</p>\n\n<p>7/ This also raises questions about whether Russia provided financial support to the cash-strapped North Korean regime or shared other military technologies, potentially affecting the security environment of the Korean peninsula.</p>\n\n<p>Conclusions:</p>\n\n<p>The quantity of supplied ammunition is a cause for concern for Ukraine, especially given the war&#39;s heavy reliance on artillery. While there have been intermittent shortages and reduced artillery firing rates, the Russian forces still maintained their own stocks of artillery ammunition. Now, these stocks have been bolstered by additional deliveries from North Korea. In the initial phases of the invasion, Russia possessed substantial advantages in terms of ammunition and artillery, which, combined with various other advantages, allowed Russians to occupy significant territories. While this won&#39;t provide Russians with a similar level of advantage as the operational environment has changed significantly, this ammo batch can be enough to run another large, or two smaller-scale operations. This will be contrasting with Ukrainian forces which just exhausted a lot of their ammo in the summer counter-offensive.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Full Analysis is here:\n<a href=\"https://frontelligence.substack.com/p/counting-the-rounds-north-korean\">https://frontelligence.substack.com/p/counting-the-rounds-north-korean</a></p>\n\n<p>Kofman seems to agree with it.\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/KofmanMichael/status/1719411957969596824\">https://twitter.com/KofmanMichael/status/1719411957969596824</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Good analysis. Think 500k is a fair and conservative estimate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>AP article today about the same topic.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>According to lawmaker Yoo Sang-bum, the South Korean National Intelligence Service believes the North shipped more than a million artillery shells to Russia through ships and other transport means since early August to help boost Russia\u2019s warfighting capabilities in Ukraine. Those shells would roughly amount to two months\u2019 worth of supplies for the Russians, Yoo said. </p>\n\n<p>The agency believes North Korea has been operating its munitions factories at full capacity to meet Russian munition demands and has also been mobilizing residents to increase production, Yoo said.

Paints a picture of what combat is looking like inside Gaza (lightly edited for clarity):\n\n>Seven soldiers from the Givati Infantry Brigade\u2019s Tzabar Battalion were killed when a Namer armored personnel carrier they were in was hit by an anti-tank guided missile fired by Hamas. Another four soldiers were wounded in the same incident, including one seriously.\n\n>Two more soldiers from the 77th Battalion of the 7th Armored Brigade were killed when their tank drove over an explosive device. Another two troops were seriously hurt in the same incident. A soldier from Givati\u2019s Rotem Battalion was seriously wounded in separate clashes in the Gaza Strip.\n\n>On Tuesday night, the IDF announced that [two soldiers] who both served in the Givati Infantry Brigade\u2019s reconnaissance unit, had been killed....when a building they were in was hit by an RPG.\n\nThe fact that an anti-tank missile was able to kill seven IDF soldiers who were inside an APC feels noteworthy. If I recall correctly, back in 2014, there weren't really any cases of rockets being able to cause this kind of damage to IDF vehicles; one similar incident back then was when troops got out of their tank to do repairs and got hit with a missile. Can anybody confirm that about the 2014 war?",

Paints a picture of what combat is looking like inside Gaza (lightly edited for clarity):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Seven soldiers from the Givati Infantry Brigade\u2019s Tzabar Battalion were killed when a Namer armored personnel carrier they were in was hit by an anti-tank guided missile fired by Hamas. Another four soldiers were wounded in the same incident, including one seriously.</p>\n\n<p>Two more soldiers from the 77th Battalion of the 7th Armored Brigade were killed when their tank drove over an explosive device. Another two troops were seriously hurt in the same incident. A soldier from Givati\u2019s Rotem Battalion was seriously wounded in separate clashes in the Gaza Strip.</p>\n\n<p>On Tuesday night, the IDF announced that [two soldiers] who both served in the Givati Infantry Brigade\u2019s reconnaissance unit, had been killed....when a building they were in was hit by an RPG.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The fact that an anti-tank missile was able to kill seven IDF soldiers who were inside an APC feels noteworthy.

The number of Hamas casualties since the invasion is basically unknowable at this point, but judging from the number of commanders reported to be killed, we can assume that it is high.

In addition to that, at least one hostage has been freed by force, with no IDF casualties.\n\nOn the northern front, meanwhile, Hezbollah appears to have been shocked by the ineffectiveness of their probing attacks against IDF forces, losing at least 50 soldiers to an IDF 7, with only one or two tanks damaged and most ATGM squads failing to even manage to launch.\n\nTo my mind this seems remarkably successful so far - a higher cost in casualties than Israeli society has typically been willing to pay in Gaza, but of course there is nothing typical about this operation or about Israeli attitudes right now.

Katsapas had partial success south of Masyutivka. First of all, this happened due to the advantage in manpower. The enemy attacked Sinkivka - was unsuccessful. Clashes continue near Pershotravnevoy and Orlyanka. The enemy rotates personnel and refreshes forces in many areas of the offensive. We should expect new large-scale offensives against the Defense Forces.\n\nBakhmut direction \u2014 Bohdanivka and Klishchiivka districts have been clarified. The enemy is trying to counterattack near Klishchiivka and Andriivka with relatively fresh forces.\n\nAvdiyiv shade - near Novokalynovy, the enemy had partial success. The Stepovoye district has been clarified: the railway line became the demarcation line. Katsaps are trying to enter the AKHZ(coke plant), but they cannot gain a foothold. They are forced to either flee or die. Instead, the enemy is improving logistics, turning Krasnohorivka into an important stronghold. On the southern face, katsaps continue to exert pressure in the Opytny and Vodyany regions. 53 OMBr has to repel these attacks every day. Katsaps want to achieve success at the expense of exhaustion. The situation is difficult. Near Maryinka, the enemy's attempts to improve the tactical position were unsuccessful.\n\nBerdyansky shade \u2014 no changes, clashes continue near Pryutny. The enemy launched an assault near the village of Shevchenko, with partial success.\n\nZaporizhzhya flavor - near Robotyny, the Defense Forces managed to occupy one of the heights. The enemy rotates and introduces new formations into the battle. At the same time, our forces are actively counterattacking. Unfortunately, in this battle, the number of infantry is decisive and, accordingly, the enemy can suffer heavy losses for a long time.\n\nTavrian shade - battles continue in Krynky.\n\nAnalytical note. The situation is difficult along the entire contact line. The enemy continues to use the advantage in manpower and equipment. He does not have significant success, but he fully possesses the initiative. The main task of the Defense Forces for the near future is to establish an effective defense in places where there is none.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>New deepstate(pro-Ukrainian source) summary of the front: <a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a> .me/DeepStateUA/17970</p>\n\n<p>at the front as of the end of the day on November 1, 2023</p>\n\n<p>Belomskovsky, Siverskyi and Bilhorodskyi areas - hostile DRGs near DKU in Chernihiv Oblast have become more active, we remind you about security measures.</p>\n\n<p>Svativsky shade \u2014 the line of demarcation north of Masyutivka and to DKU along the Oskil River has been clarified. Katsapas had partial success south of Masyutivka. First of all, this happened due to the advantage in manpower. The enemy attacked Sinkivka - was unsuccessful. Clashes continue near Pershotravnevoy and Orlyanka. The enemy rotates personnel and refreshes forces in many areas of the offensive. We should expect new large-scale offensives against the Defense Forces.</p>\n\n<p>Bakhmut direction \u2014 Bohdanivka and Klishchiivka districts have been clarified. The enemy is trying to counterattack near Klishchiivka and Andriivka with relatively fresh forces.</p>\n\n<p>Avdiyiv shade - near Novokalynovy, the enemy had partial success. The Stepovoye district has been clarified: the railway line became the demarcation line. Katsaps are trying to enter the AKHZ(coke plant), but they cannot gain a foothold. They are forced to either flee or die. Instead, the enemy is improving logistics, turning Krasnohorivka into an important stronghold. On the southern face, katsaps continue to exert pressure in the Opytny and Vodyany regions. 53 OMBr has to repel these attacks every day. Katsaps want to achieve success at the expense of exhaustion. The situation is difficult. Near Maryinka, the enemy&#39;s attempts to improve the tactical position were unsuccessful.</p>\n\n<p>Berdyansky shade \u2014 no changes, clashes continue near Pryutny. The enemy launched an assault near the village of Shevchenko, with partial success.</p>\n\n<p>Zaporizhzhya flavor - near Robotyny, the Defense Forces managed to occupy one of the heights. The enemy rotates and introduces new formations into the battle. At the same time, our forces are actively counterattacking. Unfortunately, in this battle, the number of infantry is decisive and, accordingly, the enemy can suffer heavy losses for a long time.</p>\n\n<p>Tavrian shade - battles continue in Krynky.</p>\n\n<p>Analytical note. The situation is difficult along the entire contact line. The enemy continues to use the advantage in manpower and equipment. He does not have significant success, but he fully possesses the initiative. The main task of the Defense Forces for the near future is to establish an effective defense in places where there is none. If this is not done, then new breakthroughs will appear, which will have to be patched with something.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>It seems like Russia has the initiative or is regaining the initiative on multiple fronts.

The we will keep doing October 7ths interview was especially telling. On the face of it this seems rather stupid Israel is conducting a serious operation at this point that sort of existentially threatens Hamas. However I think Hamas thinks it can win this fight and there's three reasons this makes sense\n\n1. If it can lure the IDF into Gaza City it can make the fight a blood-bath for the IDF and that this will erode support for the war in Israel. Even if the city is leveled and it loses many thousands of its fighters if it can force the IDF to withdrawal it will be a massive moral victory for the Palestinian extremist resistance and enhance its own credibility\n2. The longer and bloodier this war is the more tension is going to rack up in the Arab states isolating Israel and hopefully helping invigorate islamist parties in the region. At some point Hamas probably hopes pubic opinion in the Arab world will force it to take a stand against the US to pressure Israel to end the war\n3. The US seems unlikely to back an Israeli military operation indefinitely do to internal tensions within the Democratic Party. War-fatigue is likely to set in quickly and eventually force Biden to reign in a military operation short of its total goal.\n\nSo from Hamas perspective time is on its side and the progressive destruction of Gaza is on its side. It merely has to make the battle for Gaza City awful enough for 1 or 2 of these things to occur. I think the danger of course is that Israel achieves a tipping point (too much success) in Gaza fast enough that the war of political and military attrition fails. Once Israel conquest of Gaza looks like a fait accompli there's unlikely to be as much pressure.",

On the face of it this seems rather stupid Israel is conducting a serious operation at this point that sort of existentially threatens Hamas. However I think Hamas thinks it can win this fight and there&#39;s three reasons this makes sense</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>If it can lure the IDF into Gaza City it can make the fight a blood-bath for the IDF and that this will erode support for the war in Israel. Even if the city is leveled and it loses many thousands of its fighters if it can force the IDF to withdrawal it will be a massive moral victory for the Palestinian extremist resistance and enhance its own credibility</li>\n<li>The longer and bloodier this war is the more tension is going to rack up in the Arab states isolating Israel and hopefully helping invigorate islamist parties in the region. At some point Hamas probably hopes pubic opinion in the Arab world will force it to take a stand against the US to pressure Israel to end the war</li>\n<li>The US seems unlikely to back an Israeli military operation indefinitely do to internal tensions within the Democratic Party. War-fatigue is likely to set in quickly and eventually force Biden to reign in a military operation short of its total goal.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So from Hamas perspective time is on its side and the progressive destruction of Gaza is on its side. It merely has to make the battle for Gaza City awful enough for 1 or 2 of these things to occur. I think the danger of course is that Israel achieves a tipping point (too much success) in Gaza fast enough that the war of political and military attrition fails. Once Israel conquest of Gaza looks like a fait accompli there&#39;s unlikely to be as much pressure.</p>\n</div>",

You quoted 60%, your own source says 53% of *Palestinians*. Reality is we have no idea what the numbers are in Gaza, and even so adding an additional 7% because we feel like it is true is not an insignificant rounding error, especially when you\u2019re arguing that the vast majority of Palestinians in Gaza support Hamas and your extra 7% brings it closer to \u201cmost\u201d.\n\n>The rate is higher in Gaza than overall.\n\nI brought made up numbers into this (right after your attempted quoted statistic) after you made up the 80% figure. Palestinian support could very well be 80%, particularly inside Gaza, but we have no empirical evidence to support that so - it\u2019s made up.\n\nBTW, when people quote sources it\u2019s customary to actually include the source. Here it is: \nhttps://apnews.com/article/hamas-middle-east-science-32095d8e1323fc1cad819c34da08fd87\n\nI didn\u2019t ask for it because I\u2019ve read the quoted statistics before, many times. Even in this same subreddit.\n\n>60% of the population will not join active combat. Hamas had enough support to get any number of fighters they want.\n\nI think it\u2019s pretty obvious that 60% of the population aren\u2019t going to be active combatants, you\u2019re splitting hairs. The argument is that a larger portion are going to become active fighters. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve paid attention to conflicts / insurgencies of late (or been involved in them -I have) but people are generally more motivated to fight when it\u2019s personally affecting them and especially when tbe conflict has found it\u2019s way to their front yard. \n\nDo you really think Hamas hasn\u2019t seen a surge in volunteers since 7 October? Most people sit on the sidelines until major events happen and they\u2019re spurred into action. \n\n>What actionable role? Be specific, do you see hundred of thousands of Gaza civilians doing what? They are already actively supporting as they are able.\n\nBecoming a combatant. Passively supporting an organization =/= active in an organization. I\u2019m not even sure what we\u2019re arguing here.",

You quoted 60%, your own source says 53% of <em>Palestinians</em>. Reality is we have no idea what the numbers are in Gaza, and even so adding an additional 7% because we feel like it is true is not an insignificant rounding error, especially when you\u2019re arguing that the vast majority of Palestinians in Gaza support Hamas and your extra 7% brings it closer to \u201cmost\u201d.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The rate is higher in Gaza than overall.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I brought made up numbers into this (right after your attempted quoted statistic) after you made up the 80% figure. Palestinian support could very well be 80%, particularly inside Gaza, but we have no empirical evidence to support that so - it\u2019s made up.</p>\n\n<p>BTW, when people quote sources it\u2019s customary to actually include the source.

Even in this same subreddit.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>60% of the population will not join active combat.

One who happens to have the only battle ready army aside the US.</p>\n\n<p>And before you downvote me for taking this objective stance, this is exactly what the user describe : officials and politicians falling to (cheap) propaganda with significant geopolitical effect due to their misinformed opinions.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>A concrete example is calling Jabaliya a &quot;refugee camp&quot;, you can see in online discourse that there&#39;s some measure of baiting outrage by calling Jabaliya a &quot;refugee camp&quot; despite it being what most would call a city with multiple story buildings, roads and no tents or other markers of &quot;real&quot; refugee camps to be seen. One could think it was engineered to be put on a headline when it was attacked or maybe it&#39;s just it&#39;s name, or maybe HAMAS chose to operate from there due to the headlines they knew it would bring, who knows... maybe no one.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is an other clear exemple as you seem to ignore that the vast majority of Gazans are people who escaped from Israeli ethnic cleansing and their descendant. It is in every sense of the words a refugee camp. </p>\n\n<p>Or maybe you are intentionally obscuring it.</p>\n</div>",

Asked to clarify what a pause meant, he said: \u201cA pause means give time to get the prisoners out. Give time.\u201d\n\n> Negotiations to free 239 hostages, including children and the elderly, have continued since Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 terrorist attack killed about 1,400 people in Israel. After Hamas breached Israel\u2019s border wall, other groups from Gaza seized additional captives.\n\n> The protester, who identified herself as Rabbi Jessica Rosenberg, said she wanted Biden to call for a cease-fire.\n\n> \u201cMr. President, you care about Jewish people. As a rabbi, I need you to call for a cease-fire right now,\u201d she said.\n\n> After the crowd tried to quiet her, she said, \u201cI would love for you to answer my question,\" at which point Biden called for a pause.\n\n> He went on to say: \"This is incredibly complicated for the Israelis. I can thoroughly understand the emotions on the Palestinian side of the argument and the Jewish side of the argument.\u201d\n\n> Biden\u00a0said last week\u00a0that the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza needed to \u201cincrease\u201d after Secretary of State Antony Blinken said \u201chumanitarian pauses must be considered\u201d\u00a0so\u00a0food, water, medicine and other essential humanitarian assistance can flow into Gaza.\n\n> NBC News reported\u00a0at the time that according to a U.S. official, the White House supported a \u201cpause\u201d of indeterminate duration to allow more aid to reach Gaza and to enable those attempting passage out of the enclave to leave safely.\n\nAssuming this is what the white house wants, Blinken visiting Israel on Friday might be about this, at least partially. Israel will likely cut off Gaza city from the rest of Gaza by then, if they haven't already, so a temporary pause (if Hamas actually honors it, which is unlikely if history is anything to go by) might not be as bad for them if they plan a seige like Bennet said, since they would be waiting Hamas out anyway. Whether it would be acceptable in Israel though, is a different question and again, it depends on Hamas actually abiding by the rules for once",

I made lengthy reply but sadly the post got deleted before I could finish replying because there wasnt much meat to the post. So here is my reply to the video\n\nSo I wanna steelman the Palestinian and Iranian side of this in segments\n\n\"From the River to the sea, Palestine will be free\"\n\n\u2022\tThis means differently depending on who you ask. For some its evict Israelis send them back to Europe. For some its a one state solution with Equal rights for all and right of return for Palestinian refugees. For many I genuinely believe they think its \"From the river(Westbank) to the sea(Gaza)\", they just want all of Westbank and Gaza liberated from Israeli occupation and are not thinking of the genuine Israeli territories in between the two.\n\n\u2022\tLook at \"End Israeli Apartheid\" for many in the far left it means end Israel as a state. For normal people and liberals they mean End the occupation, end the sea blockade of Gaza, remove checkpoints and grant West Bank Palestinians freedom of movement in Westbank.\n\nArabs want Palestinians to be in a constant state of suffering so Arab leaders can point a finger towards an enemy\n\n\u2022\tI used to think this but I have actually grown away from it. It just doesnt have much staying power, doesnt initiate much \"rallying around the flag\".\n\n\u2022\tI dont believe that Arab civilians will riot hard enough and upend their own livelihoods for the sake of Palestinians and I think they ultimately look out for themselves more. Massive inflation and food price increases will cause riots regardless of whats happening in Palestine.\n\nWar with Iran\n\n\u2022\tIm sure no one in the Middle East not even Iran, Hamas or any Militia knows it can successfully invade Israel in a straight up war. Thats why they use terrorism\n\n\u2022\tAs stated by McBeth war is expensive and soldiers fighting means men not contributing to the economy. Israel as he states is a service and tech based economy and not resource based.\n\n\u2022\tIran and friends dont lose as much money if its militiamen fighting and dying its very efficient. Israel has to resort to using its military which is expensive.\n\n\u2022\tIran and friends know they they cant beat Israel but know they can wittle it down. Terrorist attacks and rockets in theory means less security which means less productivity, worse economy, less tourism, less immigration and more emigration. Israelis are very patriotic but they are human and if you they can convince a couple that having a family in New York or Melbourne is ultimately better and safer than Tel Aviv then thats a win. Hamas has already suceeding in killing Israeli tourism for the next year or so and managed to take out several hundred thousand people out of the Israeli economy. Next year the Israeli economy will take a beating.\n\n\u2022\tWhere I stay in the Philippines there's a massive increase of South Korean immigrants. South Koreans are also a pretty patriotic bunch but when I ask them why they would move to a sleepy region on the Philippines from the hightech cities of SKorea the answer is simple and samey \"They love South Korea but they know that raising a family there is just not worth it. Too much stress, the work culture is a living dystopia.\" So they leave and its a very common [sentiment](https://asiatimes.com/2019/12/75-of-young-want-to-escape-south-korean-hell/) .

South Koreans are also a pretty patriotic bunch but when I ask them why they would move to a sleepy region on the Philippines from the hightech cities of SKorea the answer is simple and samey \"They love South Korea but they know that raising a family there is just not worth it. Too much stress, the work culture is a living dystopia.\" So they leave and its a very common sentiment. You can love home and country all you want but give people options and they will almost always choose whats best for them and their family\n\nWhile it might be \"common sentiment\" in South Korea to complain about the dystopia, it's more sentiment and less action.  What you got there is a bias in sampling.  If you are running into only Koreans who left of course they are gonna say they left b/c it sucks over there.  They wouldn't have left if they had it so good in SK.  There are/were grand total of 33032 South Korean expats in Philippines as of 2021 according to South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs largely consisting of some expats from South Korea and people born in the Philippines with Korean ancestry.  Even if they were all expats, that's less than 0.06% of South Koreans emigrating to Philippines utopia to \"escape South Korean dystopia\".\n\nAnd there were grand total of 17,664 Koreans moving abroad anywhere in the five-year period from 2018 to 2022. After reaching 6,664 in 2018, the number of Koreans migrating overseas decreased to 4,412 in 2019 and 1,941 in 2020, but rebounded slightly to 2,015 in 2021 and 2,632 in 2022.  On the highest year, grand total of 0.013% of Koreans left that dystopia to move somewhere else.  That doesn't sound like a tsunami of 75% Koreans leaving the hellhall searching for a better place.  And clearly the dystopia in SK hasn't gotten any better from 2018 to 2022 so why the decrease even if covid19 affected the 2020 number and maybe 2021?",

The speaker was actually \" Vovan & Lexus \", the comic duo believed to be close to the Russian intelligence services, who in recent years have managed to mock other international leaders: from Boris Johnson to Pedro Sanchez, from Christine Lagarde to Recep Tayyip Erdogan, extorting many cases statements favorable to the Russian narrative. Beyond the incident - it is never positive that the Prime Minister's \" filter \" is violated with this ease - the (good) news seems different to me: Meloni has repeated in private what he has been saying publicly for months in matter of foreign policy. Firstly on support for Ukraine and the need for a solution that does not destroy international law.   \nConclusions : from my point of view(of the original poster of this tweet), the real problem of this government is confirmed by the management of internal affairs, the ordinary administration, the often improvident exits of some ministers and party representatives. From an international point of view we have seen much - much, trust me - worse. To this day I wouldn't complain, on the contrary. In any case, I thought it would be useful for those who don't speak English perfectly to propose the full translation of the telephone conversation.

Since the beginning of the year, therefore in just a few months, we have had more than 120 thousand people arriving mainly from Tunisia. So the situation is very difficult from every point of view. From a humanitarian, logistical and security point of view. What I see is that these flows risk increasing due to the situation in Africa, especially in the Sahel but also due to the wheat problem, due to all the problems that you know better than me. We are also working in the European Union for a memorandum in Tunisia to help, not just manage migration. My idea is always that many other things need to be done.\"  \nRussian comedian:\u201cI agree. I just met Charles Michel, we had a conversation about the situation. He said that the problem is that Italy cannot stop them. And he thinks that the problem is especially a problem for Italy\u201d.  \nMeloni:\"Yes, absolutely. For a long time Europe thought it could solve the problem by limiting it to Italy. What they don't understand is that it's impossible. The scale of this phenomenon affects, in my opinion, not only the European Union, but also the United Nations. But the problem is that others don't care. They didn't answer the phone when I called them. And they all agree that Italy must solve this problem alone. I think that's a very stupid way to think about these things.\"  \nRussian comedian:\u201cI tried to talk to Macron about it, but he also refuses to understand my position\u2026\u201d.  \nMeloni:\u201cCan I ask you something, between you and me\u2026? Do you think that what is happening, for example in Niger, is something that goes against France?\u201d.  \nRussian comedian:\u201cI say yes. Especially now...\".  \nMeloni:\u201cI see that France is pushing for some sort of intervention but I'm trying to understand how we can support a diplomatic effort. We must be careful\".  \nRussian comedian:\u201cBecause the French don't understand what the further consequences would be. If there were military aggression this would lead to another migration crisis.\"  \nMeloni:\u201cBut they have other priorities, which are not immigration to nations like Niger as you know. Their point of view is not necessarily mine. They have uranium, the African franc\u2026 They have priorities which are national priorities. We are trying to tell them\u2026 we must not \u2013 as they say \u2013 do things that create more problems for us than we already have\u201d.  \nRussian comedian:\u201cBut another problem is how to work on the new Black Sea initiative. What do you think about unblocking some Russian banks?\u201d.  \nMeloni:\u201cI think we need to discuss it. We have to find a solution for a situation that is impossible for us to deal with. There must be a solution. I also discussed it at the G20 meeting on Africa. If we allow Russia to blackmail us it could be even worse. But if we don't find other solutions it becomes an impossible problem. We have to get out of this somehow. Poland could be the right path but they are having problems...\".  \nRussian comedian:\u201cThe problem is that we expected that the war could end thanks to a good Ukrainian counteroffensive, but now I see that it is not as successful as I expected. So (\u2026) many of our and my friends on the continent are waiting for any negotiation for Ukraine and Russia to stop this conflict.\u201d  \nMeloni:\"I understand. And also immigration and the problems we have with inflation, the energy crisis, it's difficult for all of us. (\u2026) One of my strategic plans that I am also trying to discuss with other European countries is an investment plan for energy in Africa. I think it could be absolutely not immediate when you start making an investment...

The problem is what situation is acceptable to both without opening up other conflicts. (\u2026) You know what I think about Libya. Maybe you don&#39;t know (laughs, ed.). We could argue for hours, my friend, about what happened in Libya! Maybe today someone understands that the situation afterward wasn&#39;t so good, it wasn&#39;t better. (Inaudible) We have to make our brains work.<br/>\nRussian comedian:\u201cWe need money but we don&#39;t ask other institutions like the European Commission for it. I see that all the EU money is going to Ukraine now.\u201d<br/>\nMeloni:\u201cWhat I&#39;m working on is getting it to Africa too. This is my first commitment. As you will know if you follow what I say to everyone, from the Americans to NATO, I say everywhere that we must take care of Africa.&quot;<br/>\nRussian comedian:\u201cI also don&#39;t agree with the national ideology of Ukraine, I mean Bandera, there are nationalists in Ukraine, which is the thing Russia hates the most.\u201d<br/>\nMeloni:\u201cNo, I don&#39;t agree. They have the right to do it. I think that the problem of nationalism is a problem that Putin has.&quot;<br/>\nRussian comedian:\u201cI&#39;m talking about Stepan Bandera, he is a person that Russia presents as Hitler.\u201d<br/>\nMeloni:\u201cI don&#39;t know. I think they are doing what they have to do and what they have the right to do. And we are trying to help them.&quot;<br/>\nRussian comedian:\u201cAnyway, Madam Prime Minister, thank you for this conversation.\u201d<br/>\nMeloni : \u201cNo thanks to you! I hope we can have other opportunities. Thank you so much. HI&quot;.<br/>\nPs (from the original poster of this tweet). This should (had to) be a day of celebration (1st of november is an holiday in Italy, so he&#39;s working out the clock). For those who appreciate my work, the invitation is to support its independence. As?</p>\n</div>",
