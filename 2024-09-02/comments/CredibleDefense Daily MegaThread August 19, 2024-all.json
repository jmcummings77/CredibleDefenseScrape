Now, it has been [revealed that the pontoon bridge is gone, but the area is still on fire](https://x.com/kromark/status/1825637544408789053).

This leads to more political blows for Putin, as trading tons of PoWs or allowing Ukraine to keep a bunch of conscript prisoners are both \u201cbad looks\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>And on top of this, there appears to be a bit of a leadership vacuum in the area on the Russian side.</p>\n</div>",

Don't they have hundreds of thousands of troops not in Ukraine?\u00a0\n\nThere are strong indications their rail system is currently very stressed. They are a very rail orientated force.\n\nRerouting large amounts of rail can be time consuming. Its quite probable they lack enough freight capacity without significantly disrupting everything else. Espcially if they are already down on capacity as some sharp observers have suggested.\n\n>And what about air support? Does the Russian Air Force not have hundreds of fighters and bombers available?\n\nThey brought a Patriot fire unit close to the invasion point. They took losses of Frogfoots, Havocks and Hokums on the opening days.  There was also rumours of a Fullback or two getting hit. They may have traded for a Patriot fire unit but you can make a case either way (some people think it was damaged other that it was a decoy) . Generally RuAF seemed to have a very bad couple of days and some people think someone was standing on Fighterbomber channels toes very hard as they stopped posting \"Eternal Flight Comrade\" messages and just posted pictures of birds. I do not follow it so that info is second hand.\n\n>Where is the VDV\n\nWiped out. They pulled 810 Marine Infantry  straight out of Kherson and have deployed them. But many think they have been so \"roughly handled\" that its mostly new people and lack the training they had prewar.\n\n>Where are the Spetsnaz?\n\nThey do have good units in the area, among the best Ukraine has is fighting hard.

The tank farm in the<a href=\"https://nebula.wsimg.com/1068da11025693c5e7c8d792a437b249?AccessKeyId=727DB069F40969F8DA39&amp;disposition=0&amp;alloworigin=1\"> Orinoco Belt</a> did cost $550 million for a capacity of about 1,000,000. So I estimate the construction cost of Proletarsk state reserve fuel facility to be around $225 million. So if the facility was full, the cost of the infrastructure and the cost of the fuel are similar.</p>\n\n<p>Edited: added link</p>\n</div>",

Using a combination of dollars, yuan, and rubles to settle trade meant that paying for imports wasn't usually a major headache. That changed in December 2023, when U.S. President signed an executive order threatening secondary sanctions against foreign banks that facilitate transactions with Russia's military-industrial complex. In June 2024, the Moscow Exchange was sanctioned, expanding the scope of the December sanctions.\n\n>Since then, there have been more and more reports about major payment problems, especially for Russian importers. Vazhnye Istorii (VI) published a long-read on the issue on August 15. It describes how complex it has become for any Russian company to send a payment anywhere abroad. 70% of Russian importers and 30% of Russian exporters now rely on specialized agents to settle payments with foreign partners, one of VI's sources estimates. Russian companies are desperately looking for banks in China that are still willing to accept their \"Russian\" yuan, but if they are trading goods that could be linked to military use - even if it takes a lot of imagination - Chinese banks don't want yuan payments from Russia.\n\n\n>The statistics of Russia\u2019s Central Bank seem to support the reports about payment issues in Chinese currencies (see chart above). Earlier in 2024, they show a certain decrease in the share of Russian imports that are settled in yuan (more precisely: Yuan and other non-Western currencies - but this is almost all yuan). Meanwhile, the share of settlements in rubles is increasing. This is most likely due to two-stage payment schemes, as Alex Isakov from Bloomberg suggests: Russian companies pay rubles to an agent (perhaps in one of Russia's neighboring countries), and this agent pays the business partner abroad in \"clean\" currency. I recently stumbled upon an advertisement from one of these agents on a Russian telegram channel for importers.\n\n>Of course, these agents are not free. According to VI, their services increase the effective price of imports by 6-30%, depending on \u201chow intensively sanctioned\u201d a certain imported good is. These costs could be passed on to Russian consumers, worsening Russia\u2019s inflation problem. In monthly inflation figures for non-food items, there are no clear signs of this problem yet. Prices on non-food items (such as consumer goods imports) grew slower in July (4.3% from June, seasonally adjusted, annualized) than overall inflation, if the increase of gasoline prices is excluded, the Central Bank reported. But price increases in imports could be hidden behind changes in the exchange rate (the ruble was strengthening recently, at least until Ukraine\u2019s Kursk operation) or they could come with a delay.\n\n\nAny numbers coming from Russia need to be taking with a grain of salt, but the numbers above suggest that Russia is paying a significant premium on most imports due to the latest round of sanctions (which unfortunately came more than two years after the start of the war).\n\n\nObviously this is yet another factor [driving inflation](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/08/12/how-putin-hiking-taxes-fight-russia-inflation-crisis/) in Russia. Apparently the situation is so bad that Russia's central bank is considering hiking interest rates for a _seventh_ time over the past year:\n\n\n\n>Rates in 2025 are expected to remain between 14 to 16pc in 2025, up from previous guidance of between 10pc and 12pc.\n\n\n>In other words, Russia\u2019s next move in rates is more likely to be up than down.\n\n\n>\u201cIt implies that for the remainder of the year, the official rate will either stay flat at 18pc or could go up to 19pc or even 20pc as early as the next central bank meeting in September,\u201d says Weafer.\n\n\nPutin has systematically taken decisions that are good for the short term but bad for the long term. Now the reality is catching up.

This is to be expected of any U.S. president.\n\nEvery move you mentioned is tactical in nature or needs to be contextualized to purge it of disingenuous implications:\n\n1. CAATSA was a Congress-initiated bill that Congress passed with a veto-proof majority. Trump was neither the initiator nor a key approver (given the veto-proof nature of the measure). To mark this as a Trump action against Russia would be akin for giving him credit for putting troops on European ground and pointing missiles at Russia just because he signed yearly NDAAs. What he *did* do was later side with Putin's assertions that they did not interfere in the election, over U.S. intelligence findings, effectively telling the world that CAATSA was not really a punitive action against Russia over elections. This was a *huge* propaganda assist to Russia.\n\n2. Trump's approval of Javelin missiles specifically was a \"break\" from the Obama administration, but once again you're missing the larger context. Year-over-year military aid to Ukraine (FMF, foreign military financing) did not dramatically change from the Obama to the Trump presidency; it ramped up after FY2016 (the first fiscal budget drafted after the invasion) [and only modestly increased after FY2019](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R45008). What he *did* do was use this aid to extort Zelenskyy into interfering with U.S. politics, as the Congressional, nonpartisan [GAO](https://www.gao.gov/assets/b-331564.pdf) concluded.\n\n3. Again, diplomats being expelled is a minor tactical matter that I in no way see as proof that Trump is willing to exert *strategic* pressure on Russia.\n\n4. Yes, he did *lash out at our allies* over NATO spending, but if you're understanding this as a move against Russia and not a move against NATO, then you'll have to explain the 7D chess that was going on then, because the only outcome of Trump's crusade was the [near brain death of NATO](https://www.economist.com/europe/2019/11/07/emmanuel-macron-warns-europe-nato-is-becoming-brain-dead). (And no, NATO allies' increased spending is not to be attributed to Trump; again, it started with the first budgets being drawn after the Crimean invasion.)\n\n5. Again, a combination of misunderstanding motives *and* missing the context of the legislation. [In fact, Trump did not stop Nord Stream 2 \u2014 he enabled it. The Nord Stream 2 pipeline went from zero to 90 percent completed during Trump\u2019s presidency. Rather than stop it \u201cdead,\u201d the Trump administration rejected years of bipartisan congressional calls for imposition of sanctions to stop the project. Only when Congress, in frustration, passed mandatory sanctions did the administration finally take concrete action. But by then it was too late.](https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/4726844-trumps-nord-stream-2-disaster/mlite/)\n\nSo if you mean to tell me that Trump will lash out at Russia in similar ways as he did before (by offending our allies, blackmailing Ukraine, and not getting in the way of veto-proof Congressional initiatives), then, again, it doesn't matter *why you think he's doing those things*, because they will continue to help Russia and Russia only. By legitimizing their grievances, by convincing our European allies that we are not their ally, and by leaving geopolitical strategy to our legislature.\n\nYour poll has been addressed before; no matter how you slice it, a majority of Americans are in favor of providing aid to Ukraine, so your point about Biden being ineffective at selling Ukrainian aid to the American public stands on farcical ground.",

And what might have been possible with a supporting base that deserved its name, timely got its act together, a united stance and fearless interpretation instead of endless loops of self-deterrence, and that even desired an undeniable Russian defeat. I&#39;m not so much thinking of missed out recaptures, as about the thousands and thousands of lives and families that could&#39;ve been spared. On both sides, mind you. Like both sides suffer massive costs, perhaps the only thing they still share apart from language and such. It&#39;s a shame and as I see it was unnecessary.</p>\n</div>",

And the legions of natsec think tank types constantly publishing articles that amount to \"DEFENSE CONTRACTORS NEED MORE MONEY ASAP OR \\[INSERT RIVAL COUNTRY HERE\\] WILL EAT YOUR CHILDREN\" don't help. Far too many of these subject matter experts end up getting funded by the companies who have vested interest in increased military budgets. \n\nFor example, if you look at [CSIS's funding page](https://www.csis.org/about/financial-information/donors/corporations), their $100K+ corporate donor club includes:\n\n* General Atomics\n* HII\n* Lockheed Martin\n* Northrup Grumman\n* Pratt Industries\n* Bechtel\n* Boeing\n* Fujitsu\n* General Dynamics\n* Hanhwa Group\n* Hitachi\n* Mitsubishi\n* Raytheon\n* Samsung\n\nAnd those are only the ones I can easily identify as arms manufacturers. There are probably others who are too obscure for me to even know what they do. \n\nNow, I'm sure the people at CSIS mean well and plenty of them do valuable work. But it's a little hard for me to take the suggestion for the US to \"\\[deepen\\] its partnerships with Pacific nations like Japan and South Korea\" from [this article](https://www.csis.org/analysis/unpacking-chinas-naval-buildup) on China's naval build-up seriously when I know that the Hanhwa Group -- one of South Korea's largest [shipbuilding companies](https://www.hanwha.com/companies/hanwha-ocean.do) --  is donating over $100K to the think tank that's publishing the paper. At very least, it means I should be consuming their content with a generous dosage of sodium on the side. \n\nSo while there is the lazy conspiratorial version of this critique -- the tin-foil hat guy who thinks the world is ruled by a cabal of men in suit who delight in profiting off of civilian casualties -- that doesn't discount the significant conflicts of interest involved in the \"think tank industrial complex\" when it comes to who is considered an \"expert\" on these topics, and how much weight their policy recommendations are given by governments.",

Far too many of these subject matter experts end up getting funded by the companies who have vested interest in increased military budgets. </p>\n\n<p>For example, if you look at <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/about/financial-information/donors/corporations\">CSIS&#39;s funding page</a>, their $100K+ corporate donor club includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>General Atomics</li>\n<li>HII</li>\n<li>Lockheed Martin</li>\n<li>Northrup Grumman</li>\n<li>Pratt Industries</li>\n<li>Bechtel</li>\n<li>Boeing</li>\n<li>Fujitsu</li>\n<li>General Dynamics</li>\n<li>Hanhwa Group</li>\n<li>Hitachi</li>\n<li>Mitsubishi</li>\n<li>Raytheon</li>\n<li>Samsung</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And those are only the ones I can easily identify as arms manufacturers. There are probably others who are too obscure for me to even know what they do. </p>\n\n<p>Now, I&#39;m sure the people at CSIS mean well and plenty of them do valuable work. But it&#39;s a little hard for me to take the suggestion for the US to &quot;[deepen] its partnerships with Pacific nations like Japan and South Korea&quot; from <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/unpacking-chinas-naval-buildup\">this article</a> on China&#39;s naval build-up seriously when I know that the Hanhwa Group -- one of South Korea&#39;s largest <a href=\"https://www.hanwha.com/companies/hanwha-ocean.do\">shipbuilding companies</a> --  is donating over $100K to the think tank that&#39;s publishing the paper. At very least, it means I should be consuming their content with a generous dosage of sodium on the side. </p>\n\n<p>So while there is the lazy conspiratorial version of this critique -- the tin-foil hat guy who thinks the world is ruled by a cabal of men in suit who delight in profiting off of civilian casualties -- that doesn&#39;t discount the significant conflicts of interest involved in the &quot;think tank industrial complex&quot; when it comes to who is considered an &quot;expert&quot; on these topics, and how much weight their policy recommendations are given by governments.</p>\n</div>",
