This time, we expanded our coverage to include the entire area until November 28th, 2023, bringing the total number to 211.\n\n> 3/ Losses identified in Part 1 or occurring before October 10th\u2014the start of the assault\u2014are marked with white squares. Ukrainian losses are excluded from this report, focusing on Russian losses, though we couldn't identify more than 7.\n\n> 4/ This number surpasses Russian losses in any other single battle, including Vuhledar, marking it the most devastating battle for Russian forces in terms of vehicle losses. The primary categories of losses include tanks, BMPs, BTRs, MTLB, some IMVs, a couple of trucks, and MLRS\n\n> 5/ Notably, not all confirmed FPV drone hits led to observable destroyed vehicles in satellite imagery. Some vehicles may remain operational or get evacuated for repairs. An FPV drone hit doesn't always indicate a vehicle loss.\n\n> 6/ Around 50% of these losses occurred in the first three weeks of the offensive, with occasional peaks in the October-December period. This aligns with our earlier reports about a shift towards infantry assaults instead of massive mechanized troops.\n\n> 7/ We excluded several locations recorded on videos where Russian vehicles were destroyed due to the extensive explosions. However, on the imagery, there was nothing left to identify as a vehicle, other than a scorch mark and crater.\n\n> 8/ To enhance accuracy, we compared imagery from September and October to exclude vehicles destroyed before October 10th and those included in the previous report. Errors and misidentifications might still exist, but they are estimated to be no more than 12.75%\n\n> 9/ **The total number of losses would amount to approximately slightly over the complete annihilation of 5 battalions**. This represents significant losses in both equipment and personnel, considering the achieved results.\n\n> 10/ The complete list of losses with images can be found on the website linked in my bio. (I am not including the link in the thread as it significantly degrades the visibility of this thread and doesn't show up in the timeline.)\n\n> 11/ Our team is working on multiple projects, including tracking the expansion of Russian military infrastructure. Considering that we do not have stable financing, please consider the BuyMeaCoffee option linked in my bio to support us, given the very limited resources we have.\n\n> 12/ Our teams utilized geolocated data to visually map Russian vehicle losses between October 10th and November 28th, aiding in visualizing the battle for Avdiivka and identifying locations with the highest concentration and number of vehicle losses.\n\n> 13/ These materials were prepared by the Frontelligence Insight team, with assistance from volunteers and with OSINT geolocated materials: @naalsio26 , @Danspiun , @AndrewPerpetua , and @GeoConfirmed\n\nLink to mentioned web page with the complete list of losses:\n\n[Frontelligence Insight: Avdiivka: Geospatial Vehicle Loss Assesment.

This time, we expanded our coverage to include the entire area until November 28th, 2023, bringing the total number to 211.</p>\n\n<p>3/ Losses identified in Part 1 or occurring before October 10th\u2014the start of the assault\u2014are marked with white squares. Ukrainian losses are excluded from this report, focusing on Russian losses, though we couldn&#39;t identify more than 7.</p>\n\n<p>4/ This number surpasses Russian losses in any other single battle, including Vuhledar, marking it the most devastating battle for Russian forces in terms of vehicle losses. The primary categories of losses include tanks, BMPs, BTRs, MTLB, some IMVs, a couple of trucks, and MLRS</p>\n\n<p>5/ Notably, not all confirmed FPV drone hits led to observable destroyed vehicles in satellite imagery. Some vehicles may remain operational or get evacuated for repairs. An FPV drone hit doesn&#39;t always indicate a vehicle loss.</p>\n\n<p>6/ Around 50% of these losses occurred in the first three weeks of the offensive, with occasional peaks in the October-December period. This aligns with our earlier reports about a shift towards infantry assaults instead of massive mechanized troops.</p>\n\n<p>7/ We excluded several locations recorded on videos where Russian vehicles were destroyed due to the extensive explosions. However, on the imagery, there was nothing left to identify as a vehicle, other than a scorch mark and crater.</p>\n\n<p>8/ To enhance accuracy, we compared imagery from September and October to exclude vehicles destroyed before October 10th and those included in the previous report. Errors and misidentifications might still exist, but they are estimated to be no more than 12.75%</p>\n\n<p>9/ <strong>The total number of losses would amount to approximately slightly over the complete annihilation of 5 battalions</strong>. This represents significant losses in both equipment and personnel, considering the achieved results.</p>\n\n<p>10/ The complete list of losses with images can be found on the website linked in my bio. (I am not including the link in the thread as it significantly degrades the visibility of this thread and doesn&#39;t show up in the timeline.)</p>\n\n<p>11/ Our team is working on multiple projects, including tracking the expansion of Russian military infrastructure. Considering that we do not have stable financing, please consider the BuyMeaCoffee option linked in my bio to support us, given the very limited resources we have.</p>\n\n<p>12/ Our teams utilized geolocated data to visually map Russian vehicle losses between October 10th and November 28th, aiding in visualizing the battle for Avdiivka and identifying locations with the highest concentration and number of vehicle losses.</p>\n\n<p>13/ These materials were prepared by the Frontelligence Insight team, with assistance from volunteers and with OSINT geolocated materials: @naalsio26 , @Danspiun , @AndrewPerpetua , and @GeoConfirmed</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Link to mentioned web page with the complete list of losses:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://frontelligence.substack.com/p/avdiivka-geospatial-vehicle-loss\">Frontelligence Insight: Avdiivka: Geospatial Vehicle Loss Assesment.

        "body": "Another unexpected development taken place in Yemen. Iran has reportedly reached out to Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula for a strategic alliance against the West.\n\n[How the Gaza Crisis Could Bring Iran and Al-Qaeda in Yemen Together](https://sanaacenter.org/publications/analysis/21453)\n\n>Iran also went a step further in September by adding one untraditional element to its strategy. It reached out to a group very much on the margins of its sphere of influence, Al-Qaeda in Yemen, according to two sources within the group, one a security officer and the second a senior foreign jihadist. This outreach was reportedly led by the veteran Egyptian jihadist leader living in Iran, Mohammed Salah al-Din Zaidan, also known as Saif al-Adl.\n\n>Saif al-Adel became the de facto leader of Al-Qaeda\u2019s global organization after the killing of its previous leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, in 2022. He maintained a relationship with former Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Forces commander Qassem Soleimani starting in the late 1990s, which continued even after the Iranian regime detained and kept him under house arrest from 2003.\n\n>In Saif al-Adl\u2019s view, the supreme ideological objective of Al Qaeda \u2013 fighting the West and its allies in the region \u2013 necessitates a strategic alliance with Tehran. This is why, even after being released from house arrest in a prisoner exchange deal between Al-Qaeda\u2019s Yemen branch and the Iranian regime in 2015, Saif al-Adl chose to remain in Iran of his own volition, making it the permanent base of his jihadist activities.\n\n>In 2018, Saif al-Adl established his own Al-Qaeda branch in Syria under the name of Hurras al-Din. Since then, Saif al-Adl has been working to achieve two main objectives: increase his power within other important Al-Qaeda branches (namely Yemen, Somalia, and North Africa); and market his strategic vision for the group, which is based on abandoning attacks against local adversaries in favor of external operations targeting Western interests, ideally in alliance with Iran. The demise of Al-Zawahiri gave Saif al-Adl a chance to strengthen his organizational and operational influence among Al-Qaeda\u2019s various branches. Now, the Al-Aqsa Flood attacks may have created an opening for his vision of cooperation between jihadist and Iran-aligned resistance groups.\n\n>In the second half of 2023, Iranian suspicions rose that reconciliation with Riyadh \u2013 achieved earlier in the year through Chinese mediation \u2013 would not after all herald a new regional security structure in which the West was not dominant. Some in the regime came to believe that rapprochement with Riyadh was little more than a Saudi maneuver to neutralize the Iranian threat while continuing to strengthen ties with the United States and moving toward normalization with Israel.\n\n>Around the same time, the IRGC reportedly offered Saif al-Adl the option of transforming his relationship with Iran from one of security and intelligence coordination into a strategic alliance. It proposed that Yemen should be the testing ground for this approach. The Sana\u2019a Center obtained this and the following information from the security officer and senior foreign jihadist within Al-Qaeda in Yemen.\n\n>A week before the Al-Aqsa Flood attacks, Saif al-Adl reportedly sent a loyalist to Yemen to deliver a written message, commending the Yemeni Al-Qaeda branch for its recent activities against local forces allied with Washington and calling on the group to prepare for a new stage of action against Western interests in the region. According to the two Al-Qaeda sources, the letter included a recommendation that the group enter into a semi-formal strategic alliance with Iran, stop all fighting and operations targeting Iran-allied groups in the region (an implicit reference to the Houthis), and thus become an active force in the Iranian geopolitical axis opposed to the West.\n\n>In exchange, Iran would provide the necessary financial, technical, and weapons support to enable Al-Qaeda to expand operations targeting Western interests in Yemen. Al-Qaeda would also be given space to move freely and create safe havens in areas controlled by Iran and its allies, particularly in Syria and Yemen. Saif al-Adl, as the effective leader of the overall group after Al-Zawahiri\u2019s death, was apparently in a position to negotiate such terms with Tehran.\n\n>Saif al-Adl\u2019s letter was handed over to two people \u2013 his son, who resides in Yemen and is known as Ibn al-Madani, and the leader of Al-Qaeda in Yemen, Khaled Batarfi. The two leaders were inclined to accept the proposal but faced opposition from other key figures, including Khabib al-Sudani and Saad al-Awlaqi, who favored maintaining the group\u2019s independence and its formal position of enmity toward the Houthis, though they said they would support limited coordination against Western targets. During the initial discussions, most mid-level leaders and the organizational base sided with Al-Sudani and Al-Awlaqi. At the same time, there were some within the group arguing for a resumption of fighting against the Houthis in Al-Bayda governorate, which Batarfi had suspended two years ago.\n\n>Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, however, has provided a further catalyst that could motivate the group generally to consider resuming external operations at the expense of local activities. Batarfi has now tasked Saif al-Adl\u2019s son, Ibn al-Madani, with arranging operations targeting Western interests, and to that end, Ibn Al-Madani has made secret trips to Al-Mahra and Hadramawt governorates to identify potential future targets.\n\n>As the Israeli war on Gaza continues, sentiment within Al-Qaeda in Yemen seems to be divided. Most members are open to the idea of an alliance with any actor to support Palestinian militant groups in Gaza. In short, Israel\u2019s latest military campaign may be contributing to realizing Saif al-Adl\u2019s long-time goal of bringing Sunni and Shia militant groups together.\n\n>But rivals to Saif al-Adl in Al-Qaeda have a different view. They think the Al-Aqsa Flood operation is a lesson in the dangers of working with Iran. From their perspective, Tehran is happy to encourage Sunni militant groups to rush into conflicts on its behalf while risking little itself. They cite the fact that Iran has yet to provide serious support to Hamas or take action to save Gazans facing death and displacement. In the view of one jihadist leader: \u201cUnfortunately, we have seen massacres that are similar to, and even worse than, the Israeli massacres in Gaza, committed by Bashar al-Assad, Hezbollah, and (Iranian-backed) Popular Mobilization Forces against Sunnis in Syria and Iraq.\u201d",

Ofc most schills partially or fully believe what they are saying they are just being inauthentic about their motives and sometimes whose telling them to say it\n\n  \n2.

Somethings are values e.g Democracy is Good, Biden is competent and other things are facts Israel either did or did not bomb a specific hospital, the US does or do not operate bio-weapons labs in Ukraine.

                "body": "The problem is that this isn't a symmetrical fight, so trolling the other side back doesn't really work.\n\nThe advantage the West has can sort of be summed up as we are the good guys. We offer more freedom, more opportunity, more equality than some place like Russia. The trolls aren't trying to flip that and convince people that Russia is good, everybody knows it sucks and nobody knows it better than the people who live there. Instead they're trying to persuade people that those advantages the West has are fake - the West is actually racist, hypocritical, and the freedom and opportunity is a facade - the 1% are hoarding the wealth and screwing everybody else, just like they are in Russia.\n\nSo you can't really start up a counter troll farm effectively to attack Russia because nobody cares - everybody already understands Russia sucks, they don't even really care about defending themselves. And these misinformation tactics aren't as useful to portray something as a paradise as they are to smear it. Same for the other bad actors around the world.\n\nBut the good news is that although it takes a long time to debunk stuff, it works. It might take 6 hours to dispel a 15 minute lie, but when one side is getting debunked and the other isn't that's got value.\n\nThe other thing that's important is that the most devastating attacks on the West are the ones that are true. The West hasn't actually lived up to its ideals, and that hurts us in the long run. Moving closer to those ideals makes those changes of hypocrisy have a lot less staying power.

Second, because nobody was executed there isn't a clear causal chain as to why nobody was executed. Third, it's not incredibly clear - probably deliberately so - what the reprisals would have been, but they weren't self-evidently executing German prisoners. Given the war was 4 months from over and it was clear which way it was headed back then, it might have been trying anyone involved in those executions for war crimes.\n\nIf there's a situation where executing prisoners in retaliation got the other side to stop executing prisoners, I can imagine that happening, but I suspect the more common response is a cycle of escalating violence towards prisoners. But again executing prisoners hurts the side doing it, so I'm not clear on why your enemy making a mistake makes it a good idea to make a mistake in response.\n\n>We do not have an adequate defence against that.\n\nIt's impossible to have an adequate defense against that. What you're asking for here it a situation where the US/West wins every PR battle every single time. That's not realistic, and it's not realistic to demand that.\n\nI again think that the historical view shows the flaw in this thinking. At the end of WW2, the balance of power stood as the USSR in control of half of Germany and most of the things east of there. Every since then, Russia has been steadily losing ground, to the point where now Ukraine, once unquestionably part of the Russian Empire, is trying to leave. Is it important to win this latest battle? Of course. But it's weird to call something that has generally worked well a failure just because it doesn't work 100% of the time.\n\nAnd also, we haven't lost. You're assuming we don't have an adequate defense because it's possible that US Ukraine aid will fail, which itself isn't clearly enough to result in Russia conquering all of Ukraine. There's a lot of things that might happen. The US winning every PR campaign ever probably isn't one of them, but our approach seems to work better than most.",

            "body": "Non frontline combat news:\n\n**Russian Mobilization and Force Generation Efforts (Russian objective: Expand combat power without conducting general mobilization)**\n\n> Russian President Vladimir Putin continued to divert the blame for his decision to rely on and drastically expand Russian irregular armed formations amidst the full-scale invasion of Ukraine onto the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) during his joint \u201cDirect Line\u201d forum and press conference on December 14.[98] Putin responded to a question from a Russian combatant who appeared to wear a patch of the Russian \u201cVeterany\u201d irregular detachment, which is part of the \u201cRedut\u201d private military company (PMC) fighting in Ukraine.[99] The Main Directorate of the Russian General Staff (GRU) indirectly manages the \u201cRedut\u201d PMC as an irregular formation, and its troops are not entitled to state benefits offered to servicemen fighting in Ukraine as part of the Russian regular military.[100] The combatant told Putin that he and his comrades signed contracts with an unnamed PMC \u2013 likely implying Redut \u2013 but did not receive veteran status after fighting in Ukraine. Putin responded that the Russian MoD should not have let such issues emerge and reiterated that PMCs do not legally exist in Russia. Putin added that Russian law does not provide for PMC personnel and that PMC fighters technically sign contracts with the PMC rather than the state. Putin observed that PMCs compensate fighters in cash, which complicates the state\u2019s ability to account for these forces. Putin said that the Russian MoD and the Russian government are aware of these problems, and vaguely stated Russia would make changes to the law \u201dif it is necessary\u201d and \u201dif it is impossible\u201d to solve these problems.\n\n> Putin\u2019s comment on Russian PMCs is an indicator that the Kremlin remains committed to incentivizing volunteer recruitment into irregular formations rather than launching another mobilization wave in the immediate future. The Kremlin has consistently relied on irregular formations to support its war effort in Ukraine without upsetting Russian society with another mobilization campaign and had likely hoped that the extent of these irregular formations (which have dramatically expanded as a result of a volunteer recruitment campaign) would remain concealed from the Russian public. Deceased Wagner Group financier Yevgeny Prigozhin and his network in the Russian information space destroyed the Kremlin\u2019s efforts to conceal its use of irregular forces after Prigozhin began to publicly call on the Kremlin to legally recognize irregular forces.[101] Putin\u2019s \u201dDirect Line\u201d is a highly scripted event, and the Kremlin had likely deliberately included this discussion to acknowledge growing public concerns over the lack of state compensation for irregular formations in an effort to regain control over the narrative and ensure that Russia can continue recruiting volunteers in this way. Putin\u2019s delegation of this issue to the Russian MoD also creates favorable rhetorical conditions to justify the ongoing irregular force formalization campaign as the state\u2019s effort to compensate and account for all irregular forces, instead of acknowledging its actual objective of restoring the Kremlin\u2019s control over irregular formations following the Wagner mutiny.\n\n> Putin also stated that Russia needs a \u201cspecial organ, not just the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD)\u201d to address issues with migration to Russia, likely as part of increasing efforts to restrict migrant activity in Russia and to coerce migrants into Russian military service.[102] Putin stated that there are over 10 million migrants in Russia and that Russia continues to need their labor but emphasized the importance of prioritizing Russian citizens\u2019 needs.[103] Putin also reiterated his support for Russifying migrants in Russia and citizens of post-Soviet countries through the establishment of Russian and Russian-speaking educational institutions abroad.[104]\n\n**Russian Technological Adaptations (Russian objective: Introduce technological innovations to optimize systems for use in Ukraine)**\n\n> The Institute of Science and International Security (ISIS) observed that a Russian economic zone tasked with the production of Shahed drones in the Republic of Tatarstan is installing additional security and building new infrastructure likely in an effort to expand Russia\u2019s drone production.[105] The Washington Post previously found that Russian companies operating within the \u201dAlabuga\u201d Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in Tatarstan were working on changing the design of the Iranian Shahed-136 drones and were planning to produce 6,000 such drones by summer 2025.[106] ISIS observed ongoing construction work in the Alabuga SEZ, the installation of a new external wall and barricades along roads, and the establishment of new checkpoints around the territory based on satellite imagery. ISIS assessed that this level of security indicates that the order to produce drones for the Russian military has \u201cseriously changed the business strategy\u201d for the Alabuga SEZ, which tried to attract foreign manufacturers of civilian goods before the war. ISIS experts also assessed that the observed construction activity is consistent with the proposed timetable for expanding production and reducing dependence on supplies from Iran. ISIS experts noted that leaked internal documents indicated that Alabuga began assembling Shahed drones from ready-made Iranian components in early 2023 and is now preparing to open its production lines.[107]\n\n**Activities in Russian-occupied areas (Russian objective: Consolidate administrative control of annexed areas; forcibly integrate Ukrainian citizens into Russian sociocultural, economic, military, and governance systems)**\n\n> Russian authorities and occupation officials continue to establish programs aimed at indoctrinating Ukrainian youth into Russian cultural and national identities. Russian Minister of Culture Olga Lyubimova reportedly worked with Luhansk People\u2019s Republic (LNR) authorities to open a new children\u2019s center at the Stanytsiya-Luhanska Local Lore Museum aimed at teaching children about Russian history.[108] LNR authorities also advertised an opportunity for 260 people from occupied Ukraine to participate in the \u201dIt\u2019s Our Family\u201d Festival and competition, which is part of the International Exhibition and Forum in Moscow.[109] The \u201cIt\u2019s Our Family\u201d Festival is reportedly part of a wider educational program likely aimed at promoting Russian historical and educational narratives.\n\n**Russian Information Operations and Narratives**\n\n> The Kremlin continued to push an information operation that Ukraine would have no choice but to surrender to Russia\u2019s maximalist demands if the West ceased military aid provision to Ukraine and revitalized its \u201cred line\u201d narrative, which it routinely promoted immediately before launching a full-scale invasion. Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov claimed on December 13 that the military and political situation is becoming more disadvantageous for Ukraine and that the \u201cKyiv regime knows really well\u201d what it needs to do to resolve this situation.[110] Peskov added that Ukrainian officials also are very familiar with where Ukraine \u201ccrossed the red lines.\u201d Peskov\u2019s explicit use of the \u201cred lines\u201d framework is a direct callback to the ultimatum rhetoric in late 2021 and early 2022 that the Kremlin used to try to coerce the West into sacrificing Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and to create conditions for Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.[111] Peskov\u2019s statement likely seeks to blame Ukraine for not negotiating on Russia\u2019s extremist terms to decisively align itself with Russia and deprive itself of its sovereign right freely to choose its own alliances and partnerships \u2013 a core demand that the Kremlin pushed in its ultimatums in late 2021. ISW assessed on December 13 that the Kremlin began to increasingly push information operations that discuss Ukraine\u2019s borders and territories to cajole the international community into abandoning key components of Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty: its territorial integrity as defined in 1991 and its right to form alliances and international partnerships of its choosing.[112]\n\n> The Kremlin is additionally pushing an information operation that aims to transform what had been personalized attacks on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the current Ukrainian leadership into generalized attacks on any pro-Western Ukrainian government. Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Maria Zakharova implied on December 12 that the replacement of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky by the West \u2013 the whole notion of which is entirely a Russian information operation - will not ultimately \u201cchange the situation in the Ukrainian conflict\u201d because Ukrainian officials are not \u201cindependent\u201d figures and are Western \u201cpuppets.\u201d[113] The narrative that Ukraine is a Western \u201dpuppet-state\u201d is standard for the Kremlin, but the evolving narrative that started with bizarre Russian claims that the West was preparing to replace Zelensky is now setting conditions for Russia to reject the legitimacy of any Ukrainian government that is not pro-Russian. The Kremlin\u2019s propaganda often falsely framed Zelensky as the current instigator of the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and the new information campaign will support Kremlin efforts to insist on its right to determine which Ukrainian government is an acceptable partner with which to negotiate.[114]",
