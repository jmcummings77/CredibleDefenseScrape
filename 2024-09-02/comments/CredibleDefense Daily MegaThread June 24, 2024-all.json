As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

Certainly, keeping everything they've taken since 2014 and keeping Ukraine out of NATO/EU would be the *starting points* for negotiations, as Putin articulated a little while ago. However, their demands go far further than that, dating back to the pre-2014 era. Through supporting entities like the Party of Regions and the Communist Party of Ukraine, Russia attempted to get Ukraine to join the Eurasian Economic Union, elevate Russian to an official state language, rehabilitate Stalin, introduce federalization of Ukraine with the goal of the maximum weakening of the Ukrainian state, legalize the canonical status of the Russian Orthodox Church and remove the legal registration of Ukrainian churches supporting autocephaly, discontinue the \u201cfalsification\u201d of history and \u201cBanderite\u201d trends in education, restore the \u201cLittle Russian\u201d Ukrainian identity within a larger Russian civilization, and permit the creation of a Russian-Ukrainian military union, along with the removal of \u201cBanderite\u201d trends in the Army and SBU. Put shortly, the Kremlin\u2019s designs for Ukraine were (and are) to turn it into a quasi-independent rump state without control over its teaching of history, its language, its religion, its military, and its foreign policy. Many of these things would likely be insisted on by the Kremlin in prospective negotiations now. \n\nMoreover, Russian territorial claims are not limited to Donbas, Crimea, and the land bridge to Crimea. Kharkiv, Odesa, Dnipropetrovsk, and Mykolaiv are all included in Novorossiya, and there was manufactured unrest throughout those Oblasts during the early stages of the 2014 operation, but it had little public support, so it largely went nowhere. Still, they do absolutely desire more than what they currently control. Russian imperial nationalists seek to annex Southern and Eastern Ukraine, control an east-central and west-central Ukrainian rump state with perhaps less autonomy than even Belarus, and potentially permit a West Ukrainian state to exist, or encourage it to be annexed by Poland, Romania, and Hungary, as they proposed in early 2014. \n\n>Since the fall of the USSR, Russia maintained influence in Ukraine.

After everything that has happened since 2014 and especially 2022, any possibilities of a friendly or even neutral government in Kyiv are long gone. If you want Ukraine to cede claims to Donbas, Crimea, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson, and likely implement a whole host of other policies that turn Ukraine into a second Belarus, you need to have a major physical presence there to put in place and hold up the government that will do that.

                "body": "Ukraine's repair attempts aggregated over a year during and after the first power generation campaign were lacklustre at best, they managed to bring back on line approximately 15% of the damaged capacity, not 15% of total generation, ***just 15% of the lost capacity from the first campaign in 2022.***\n\nThis was also when Russia were leaning towards targeting substations and generally speaking were not as aggressively destroying the generating units themselves. A combination of factors including increased missile inventory, better targeting data, better accuracy and seemingly much less care for the wholesale loss of generating capacity have resulted in a much more effective energy campaign this time round. \n\n>However, it is estimated that there will be at least a\u00a0[35% deficit](https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/news-svitlo-zyma-dtek-kovalenko-vymknennya-viyna/32996764.html)\u00a0in capacity come winter. Russia\u2019s 2022 campaign to destroy Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure is estimated to have damaged\u00a0[close to 50%](https://www.rescue.org/uk/article/what-ukrainians-need-survive-winter)\u00a0of its capacity. The affected power stations were repaired and returned to service in 2023.\n\nThis is such a broad statement as to be almost entirely non-credible in this discussion. The majority of \"affected\" power stations were damaged irreparably and lost most of their generating units. If our metric of success is merely serviceable operation and not the actual quantifiable generating capacity provided (which is far more relevant) then what the hell are we even discussing or measuring here. \n\nDescribing those stations as repaired in the context of losing half of the nationwide electrical capacity is also far too broad. It gives the reader the impression that Ukraine made headway on repairs, which isn't really true.

                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Ukraine&#39;s repair attempts aggregated over a year during and after the first power generation campaign were lacklustre at best, they managed to bring back on line approximately 15% of the damaged capacity, not 15% of total generation, <strong><em>just 15% of the lost capacity from the first campaign in 2022.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>This was also when Russia were leaning towards targeting substations and generally speaking were not as aggressively destroying the generating units themselves. A combination of factors including increased missile inventory, better targeting data, better accuracy and seemingly much less care for the wholesale loss of generating capacity have resulted in a much more effective energy campaign this time round. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>However, it is estimated that there will be at least a\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/news-svitlo-zyma-dtek-kovalenko-vymknennya-viyna/32996764.html\">35% deficit</a>\u00a0in capacity come winter. Russia\u2019s 2022 campaign to destroy Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure is estimated to have damaged\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.rescue.org/uk/article/what-ukrainians-need-survive-winter\">close to 50%</a>\u00a0of its capacity. The affected power stations were repaired and returned to service in 2023.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is such a broad statement as to be almost entirely non-credible in this discussion. The majority of &quot;affected&quot; power stations were damaged irreparably and lost most of their generating units. If our metric of success is merely serviceable operation and not the actual quantifiable generating capacity provided (which is far more relevant) then what the hell are we even discussing or measuring here. </p>\n\n<p>Describing those stations as repaired in the context of losing half of the nationwide electrical capacity is also far too broad. It gives the reader the impression that Ukraine made headway on repairs, which isn&#39;t really true. The majority of generating losses in 2022 were due primarily to occupation and secondarily to substation and generating unit strikes, the majority of generating losses in 2023/2024 were instead due primarily to generating unit strikes.

Building defences behind the LOC in the Donbas, mobilization, prioritizing the protection of energy grid infrastructure etc. \n\nI'd argue that in the context of this war the damage is long term as well.

Some embassies and diplomatic missions advised their nationals and employees to leave and cease travel to Lebanon. Others considered evacuation measures in case the conflict escalated or a major war broke out.\n\n>In the past few days, the risk that the southern front could slip out of control reverted to a high level, against a backdrop of ongoing political and diplomatic efforts and maximum pressure to head off such a scenario.\n\n>However, obstacles seem to be blocking this process, particularly since US envoy Amos Hochstein visited Tel Aviv and Beirut last week.

Some embassies and diplomatic missions advised their nationals and employees to leave and cease travel to Lebanon. Others considered evacuation measures in case the conflict escalated or a major war broke out.</p>\n\n<p>In the past few days, the risk that the southern front could slip out of control reverted to a high level, against a backdrop of ongoing political and diplomatic efforts and maximum pressure to head off such a scenario.</p>\n\n<p>However, obstacles seem to be blocking this process, particularly since US envoy Amos Hochstein visited Tel Aviv and Beirut last week. Shortly afterward, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released a video criticizing the US administration for suspending arms deliveries to his country.</p>\n\n<p>In the wake of this, an Israeli delegation was sent to Washington to discuss developments in Gaza and Lebanon.
