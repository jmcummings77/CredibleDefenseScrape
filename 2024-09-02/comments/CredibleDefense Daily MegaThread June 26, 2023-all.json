They have a mixed of equipment generally made to look like Russian kit, and they use some Russian tactics, but they actually perform really well because they do it nonstop, memorized every inch of microterrain in the whole place, and many units don't show up actually fully prepared. \n\nOf the three types of brigades the US Army has, the only one meant to fight an mechanized enemy are armored BCTs, they have our tanks and IFV. They've got great tactical mobility, minus jungles, mountains, muddy areas, etc. But they're extremely slow to move across the world, or even across Europe. They're super expensive, and they SUCK at small wars, a type of conflict the US Army hates to be involved in but won't stop being involved in and can't ignore.\n\nInfantry BCTs are basically light infantry, usually airborne, air assault, or without any concrete means of travel; they walk for a living. Great for strategic mobility because they're easy to deploy, stick em on commercial airliners and you can move most of the brigade, with limited military airlift or shipping capacity needed to move heavy weapons, towed artillery, trucks, etc. But they have horrific tactical mobility and especially protection. They can fight a Near Peer enemy well in constrictive terrain doing defensive ops, but they're barely a speed bump elsewhere.\n\nStryker BCT are a mix of the two. The idea is to give more mobility to infantry, give them better protection, while keeping them light enough to have good strategic mobility. They're basically made to fight in small wars in lieu of armored BCTs. Infantry Carrier Vehicles (ICV), making up most, have a remote .50 cal machine gun or 40mm grenade launcher on the roof. Each brigade only got one company of AT variants with TOW launchers. There was an Mobile Gun System variant with a 105mm gun and crappy reliability, but that was meant as an assault gun to support infantry, not to take on the duties of a tank. \n\nA Russian motor rifle brigade has an  IFV for every infantry squad, with a cannon that fires armor piercing ammo and ATGMs with ranges from 1-5k. Plus each has a full tank battalion too, who can accurately engage targets at long distances. If a Stryker ICV goes head to head with them while mounted, they get annihilated. \n\nHowever, the best weapon systems the Stryker BCT has to kill enemy armor are its dismounts, with plenty of Javelins, MAAWS, and even AT4s. But they can only do that when they're dismounted and relatively close. But they have almost no chance attacking to close the range (see Wagner in Bakhmut) but if they defend they can do what the Ukrainians did to the Russians in the first month of the war. \n\nThe Strykers serve as battle taxis to move the infantry around, and then they dismount, kill Russian armor in ambushes, then load up and move before artillery rains down. Rinse and repeat, typically having to retreat while doing it. That's okay, because they should only be facing off against the Russians (or other near peer mechanized enemy forces) to slow them down while the US ships armored brigades to the conflict zone.

They have a mixed of equipment generally made to look like Russian kit, and they use some Russian tactics, but they actually perform really well because they do it nonstop, memorized every inch of microterrain in the whole place, and many units don&#39;t show up actually fully prepared. </p>\n\n<p>Of the three types of brigades the US Army has, the only one meant to fight an mechanized enemy are armored BCTs, they have our tanks and IFV. They&#39;ve got great tactical mobility, minus jungles, mountains, muddy areas, etc. But they&#39;re extremely slow to move across the world, or even across Europe. They&#39;re super expensive, and they SUCK at small wars, a type of conflict the US Army hates to be involved in but won&#39;t stop being involved in and can&#39;t ignore.</p>\n\n<p>Infantry BCTs are basically light infantry, usually airborne, air assault, or without any concrete means of travel; they walk for a living. Great for strategic mobility because they&#39;re easy to deploy, stick em on commercial airliners and you can move most of the brigade, with limited military airlift or shipping capacity needed to move heavy weapons, towed artillery, trucks, etc. But they have horrific tactical mobility and especially protection. They can fight a Near Peer enemy well in constrictive terrain doing defensive ops, but they&#39;re barely a speed bump elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>Stryker BCT are a mix of the two. The idea is to give more mobility to infantry, give them better protection, while keeping them light enough to have good strategic mobility. They&#39;re basically made to fight in small wars in lieu of armored BCTs. Infantry Carrier Vehicles (ICV), making up most, have a remote .50 cal machine gun or 40mm grenade launcher on the roof. Each brigade only got one company of AT variants with TOW launchers. There was an Mobile Gun System variant with a 105mm gun and crappy reliability, but that was meant as an assault gun to support infantry, not to take on the duties of a tank. </p>\n\n<p>A Russian motor rifle brigade has an  IFV for every infantry squad, with a cannon that fires armor piercing ammo and ATGMs with ranges from 1-5k. Plus each has a full tank battalion too, who can accurately engage targets at long distances. If a Stryker ICV goes head to head with them while mounted, they get annihilated. </p>\n\n<p>However, the best weapon systems the Stryker BCT has to kill enemy armor are its dismounts, with plenty of Javelins, MAAWS, and even AT4s. But they can only do that when they&#39;re dismounted and relatively close. But they have almost no chance attacking to close the range (see Wagner in Bakhmut) but if they defend they can do what the Ukrainians did to the Russians in the first month of the war. </p>\n\n<p>The Strykers serve as battle taxis to move the infantry around, and then they dismount, kill Russian armor in ambushes, then load up and move before artillery rains down. Rinse and repeat, typically having to retreat while doing it. That&#39;s okay, because they should only be facing off against the Russians (or other near peer mechanized enemy forces) to slow them down while the US ships armored brigades to the conflict zone. Then THEY go on the counterattack and can outrange, outshoot the enemy AFV.</p>\n</div>",

This civic solidarity has shown that any blackmail, any attempts to create internal turmoil, are doomed to fail.\n\nLet me repeat, there was the highest consolidation of society, the executive and the legislature at all levels. A firm, unambiguous position of support for the constitutional order was adopted by public organizations, religious confessions, major political parties and, in fact, by all of Russian society. All united and united by the main thing - responsibility for the fate of the Fatherland.\n\nI emphasize that from the very beginning of the events immediately all necessary decisions were taken to neutralize the threat, to protect the constitutional order, lives and safety of our citizens.\n\nThe armed uprising would have been suppressed in any event. The organizers of the mutiny, despite their loss of adequacy, could not fail to understand this. They understood everything, including the fact that they took criminal steps to split and weaken the country, which is now facing an enormous external threat and unprecedented pressure from outside. When at the front with the words \"Not one step back!\" our comrades are dying.\n\nBut the organizers of the mutiny, having betrayed their country and their people, betrayed also those whom they dragged into the crime. Lying to them, pushing them to death, under fire, to shoot their own.\nThis was the outcome - fratricide - that Russia's enemies wanted: the neo-Nazis in Kiev, and their Western patrons, and all kinds of national traitors. They wanted Russian soldiers to kill each other, they wanted soldiers and civilians to die, they wanted Russia to lose in the end, and they wanted our society to split, to choke in bloody internecine strife.\nThey rubbed their hands together, dreaming of taking revenge for their failures at the front and during the so-called counteroffensive, but miscalculated.\n\nI thank all our servicemen, law enforcement officers and special services who stood in the way of the insurgents and remained faithful to their duty, their oath and their people. The courage and self-sacrifice of the fallen heroic airmen saved Russia from tragic devastation.\n\nAt the same time we knew and know that the vast majority of the fighters and commanders of the Wagner group are also patriots of Russia, devoted to their people and the state. They proved this with their courage on the battlefield, liberating Donbass and Novorossiya. They attempted to be used in the dark against their brothers in arms, with whom they fought together for the country and its future.\n\nTherefore, from the very beginning of events, steps were taken on my direct instruction to avoid great bloodshed. It took time, among other things, to give those who had made a mistake a chance to come to their senses, to realize that their actions were firmly rejected by society and that the adventure in which they had been involved had tragic and destructive consequences for Russia and for our state.\n\nI thank those soldiers and commanders of the Wagner Group who took the only correct decision - they did not consent to fratricidal bloodshed, they stopped at the last line.\n\nToday you have an opportunity to continue serving Russia by signing a contract with the Ministry of Defense or other security agencies, or to return to your families and loved ones. Those who want can also go to Belarus. My promise will be kept. I repeat, the choice is up to each of you, but I am sure it will be the choice of those warriors of Russia who have understood their tragic mistake.\n\nI am grateful to President of Belarus Alexander Grigorievich Lukashenko for his efforts and contribution to the peaceful resolution of the situation.\n\nBut, once again, it was the patriotic spirit of citizens and the consolidation of Russian society as a whole that played a decisive role in these days. This support made it possible for us together to overcome the most difficult trials for our homeland.",

I am open to the possibility, and here&#39;s another example of being a contrarian ass: using a person&#39;s openness towards possibilities as an argument against what they&#39;re saying.   </p>\n\n<p>I would posit a token Wagner force could be dealt with by the TDF. At worst Ukraine would pull up some of the Offensive Guard which, fun fact, **are TDF.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>You go for personal attacks very quickly don&#39;t you?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Oh that isn&#39;t a personal attack.<br/>\nYou <strong>factually</strong> are being an illogical contrarian.</p>\n</div>",

I thought this sub was credible??\n\nedit: the report itself \n\nhttps://silverado.org/news/report-russia-shifting-import-sources-amid-u-s-and-allied-export-restrictions/\n\n> Following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the United States formed a coalition with 37 allies and partners that imposed sanctions and export controls to limit Russia\u2019s access to foreign goods and technology and erode its ability to sustain the war. U.S. sanctions have immobilized Russian Central Bank assets and targeted thousands of individuals and entities. U.S. export controls were imposed to \u201cchoke off exports of technologies and other items that support Russia\u2019s defense industrial base ... and to degrade Russia\u2019s military capabilities and ability to project power.\u201d Export controls include bans or restrictions on products for military end use or to military end users, bans on exports of certain foreign-origin items like semiconductors produced with U.S. advanced technologies, tools, and software, and restrictions on exports of luxury goods to impose costs on Russian oligarchs.

As much as Belarusians don\u2019t like Luka, they probably prefer him over Prigo\n\nAs such it\u2019s in their best cold hearted interest to support Luka against both internal and external threats in order to protect their own position. This protects Luka from an internal uprising, and also from a Russia who would like to absorb Belarus.\n\nFurthermore, they should now have nuclear weapons in their country. Should Russia dissolve, the West would still be hesitant to go into Belarus given that nuclear weapons are there. It gives them an incredible bargaining chip.\n\nIs Luka basically untouchable now?

They cannot possibly overthrow Lukashenko and be accepted as the new leadership. As much as Belarusians don\u2019t like Luka, they probably prefer him over Prigo</p>\n\n<p>As such it\u2019s in their best cold hearted interest to support Luka against both internal and external threats in order to protect their own position. This protects Luka from an internal uprising, and also from a Russia who would like to absorb Belarus.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, they should now have nuclear weapons in their country. Should Russia dissolve, the West would still be hesitant to go into Belarus given that nuclear weapons are there. It gives them an incredible bargaining chip.</p>\n\n<p>Is Luka basically untouchable now? Maybe he really is smarter than he acts\u2026</p>\n</div>",

Its exactly where it was when I wrote those comments earlier. Wagners broken up, disarmed and its leader is still in exile with a price on his head. There was literally no new information in the speech we didn&#39;t have earlier....except, maybe, that other commanders who were &quot;responsible&quot; might have prices put on their heads too I guess.</p>\n\n<p>Thats not &quot;You get to take your T72&#39;s and Pantsir&#39;s with you&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Thats.... &quot;You&#39;re free to go, with no charges&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Ex Wagner soldiers still don&#39;t have any arms or ammo.

So we\u2019re the other units that had sprung up that we called PMCs like \u201cStream\u201d (Gazproms) and \u201cTsars Wolves\u201d (Shoigus).</p>\n\n<p>As of 1st July these become illegal too. There is no longer a workaround.</p>\n\n<p>Either the \u201cowner\u201d of the PMC/Volunteer Unit (the guy/org who they signed their volunteer contract with) signs them over to the MoD <em>en masse</em> by transferring those contract to the MoD (as Kadyrov did with Akhmat, on the assurance he\u2019d be appointed to control them by the MoD)\u2026.. OR\u2026.. they are dissolved and the individuals can sign one-by-one to the MoD and any that do not do so will go home as a private citizen. (as Prigozhin has done with Wagner).</p>\n\n<p>There is no third option where they carry on being a military unit armed with military weapons but outside MoD control.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s become a MoD unit\u2026. Or\u2026. Dissolve and sign individually \u2026.. Or \u2026.. Dissolve and go home as a private citizen, unarmed.</p>\n\n<p>That\u2019s why Prigozhin was so livid. If he could carry on being a PMC exactly as before\u2026. Then there was no need to fabricate an attack and march on Moscow.</p>\n</div>",

The military has previously referred to Wagner as a \u201cvolunteer assault unit.\u201d\n\n>On Monday, the ministry said it signed its first contract with Kremlin-allied Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov\u2019s Akhmat military unit.\n\n>\u201cPMC Wagner will not sign any contracts with Shoigu,\u201d Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin said in an audio message published by his press service Saturday.\n\nKadyrov's Akhmat signed the new contract.\n\n>It simply means the MoD can now directly tell them to go here or there and they are better integrated into logistics, rather than butting heads over who does what and who gets what.\n\nYes, and Prigozhin has refused to sign over command of Wagner.\n\n>Second, this isn't the first time Russia has taken similar actions. The have laws (Article 13, Article 71, Article 359, among others) that states that PMCs are outright illegal... and yet they have many of them.\n\nYes, the legal fiction right now is that they are volunteer forces, and that those volunteer forces can be under the control of entities that are not the MoD (e.g. Prigozhin).\n\nAs of 1st July, all those volunteer forces have to sign up to be MoD personnel, like any other MoD personnel, under the command of whoever the MoD puts in command of them. \n\nIn the case of Akhmat, I understand they've been put under the command of the Govenor of the Chechen republic.

The military has previously referred to Wagner as a \u201cvolunteer assault unit.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>On Monday, the ministry said it signed its first contract with Kremlin-allied Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov\u2019s Akhmat military unit.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cPMC Wagner will not sign any contracts with Shoigu,\u201d Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin said in an audio message published by his press service Saturday.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Kadyrov&#39;s Akhmat signed the new contract.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It simply means the MoD can now directly tell them to go here or there and they are better integrated into logistics, rather than butting heads over who does what and who gets what.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes, and Prigozhin has refused to sign over command of Wagner.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Second, this isn&#39;t the first time Russia has taken similar actions. The have laws (Article 13, Article 71, Article 359, among others) that states that PMCs are outright illegal... and yet they have many of them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes, the legal fiction right now is that they are volunteer forces, and that those volunteer forces can be under the control of entities that are not the MoD (e.g. Prigozhin).</p>\n\n<p>As of 1st July, all those volunteer forces have to sign up to be MoD personnel, like any other MoD personnel, under the command of whoever the MoD puts in command of them. </p>\n\n<p>In the case of Akhmat, I understand they&#39;ve been put under the command of the Govenor of the Chechen republic.

They just have a compelling, powerful image. It is known that they've succeeded in a few areas where regular forces have failed; Prigozhin is somewhat good at moving speeches; and they've been effective at exaggerating the difference and appropriating credit. Reminder that Prigozhin is a man of many talents and careers, one among those being management of the so-called Internet Research Agency [1]; catering business, paramilitary operations and illustration of children's books [2] aside, he's been in charge of propaganda for a long time now.\n\n> 2. Adding to that, they just have an outsized presence in people's minds, there are catchy edgy music videos [3] and decently made movies [4] of their production (with military history buffs praising that movie), many affiliated Telegram channels, they're just very online, including Prigozhin personally \u2013 unlike Russian Ministry of Defense that's infamously behind the times, secretive, prone to embarrassing transparent lies, \"boomer-like\". It's another Russian self-own, in a sense, because the MoD grasped at Wagnerite meme magic to rescue the perception of the campaign, and became overshadowed as a result.\n\n> 3. The war is not genuinely popular, especially now that it's clearly close to being lost. Surveys to the effect that 70% of Russians support the war omit details that this support is often in the form \"we'll be exterminated if we surrender\" [5], it's not driven by some positive expectation of Imperial greatness but by fear, very much like 1945 Germany but exacerbated by connectivity [6]; there was an awful lot of chauvinistic smugness early on, but not now. Prigozhin articulates criticism of the status quo (Ukraine never planned to attack, the operation was a mistake, it needlessly made Ukraine into a real threat, eroded Russian prestige, brought NATO closer to the heart of Russia than it'd have been otherwise etc.) [7] that resonates with people vastly more than coping output of the official organs.\n\n> 4. People really, truly hate and look down on Shoigu, even people in the regular army. Thus they did not open fire at Wagner forces, and there's such a volatile situation that soldiers at the frontline are often not given arms, due to fear of mutiny. It is known at this point, in large part thanks to Wagner propaganda, that Shoigu is a corrupt bureaucratic oaf not qualified for his job, who appopriates vast sums and even diverts military resources for his pampered daughter, who only became a Minister due to his ties within Russian elite (he's one of the most powerful members of the gang, jumping between top-level posts for three decades). He's a lightning rod for all aspects of dissatisfaction with the way the war has gone for Russia (which might be part of why Putin keeps him around). And he's specifically hated by the unorganized but powerful undercurrent of ethnic Russian nationalism, due to being perceived as a strongly identifying Tuvan Buddhist [8] feudal lord with a private army [9] who is completely beyond any reproach and glibly sends tens of thousands of Russians (plus of course other peoples) to the meatgrinder, in meat waves, for zero benefit. Shoigu is understood as \"noviop\" [10], a member of semi-artificial Soviet post-ethnic people, and the deeper one's ethno-nationalism, the less support he gets, with people really concerned about Slavic race and so on charging him with slaughter of Slavs on both sides. In contrast, Prigozhin plays up his Russophilic and Slavophilic attitude, has his son serving in Wagner, cries crocodile tears about the loss of lives, and very pointedly, repeatedly drives the connection, in very simple language: \"the \"Tuvan degenerate\" Shoigu denies us materiel \u2013 thousands of our Russian boys are getting killed by the enemy\". With Ukrainians apparently unbeatable and, frankly, acting in their right, the conclusion about ways to stop boys from being killed becomes obvious enough. Like Kadyrov, his fellow warlord, he conspicuously does not accuse the Supreme Leader of any wrongdoing, but the implication about actions he believes are legitimate for Putin to take are clear.\n\nIt's a good post that should be read in full.",

He said Scott Ritter was his primary source on most things ukraine war these days and praised him. It did set off a few red flags im the discussion though, like a distinctly pro russian KIA count for Bakmhut, the near certainty of Prighozin somehow being an MI6 agent (the CIA being too hamstrung by elderly Biden to take the initiative on this operation) and the arrest by the FSB of several ukr sabotage groups in Moscow 4 days ago that should have supported Prighozin's march on moscow with general chaos and bombings.\n\nObviously, half of this didnt pass the sniff test, and threw into doubt the credible-sounding other half.

Those are the only circles that will have him since they're desperate for even the hint of credibility - usually they'll tout Ritter's work as a weapons inspector in the late 90's/early 2000's and dismiss his criminal convictions as the product of federal conspiracies for the work he did to undermine the Bush administration's case for war against Iraq. I'm not aware of any other anti-war activists that had under-age sex crime convictions against them, but whatever they need to tell themselves.\n\nRitter is avowedly a pro-war cheerleader for Russia that heavily favors \"evidence\" from official MoD statements and pro-RU telegram conspiracy theories over any material facts on the ground. The equivalent on the pro-Ukraine side would be like a pro-Russian Chuck Pfarer - someone that's found a new career after suffering serious audience capture where their notoriety is based entirely on telling an audience what they want to hear, and damn the actual facts of the matter. \n\nRitter was actually disinvited from that tankie \"anti-war\" rally in Washington D.C. a few months back, and contrary to popular belief it wasn't even because of his sex crime convictions, [it was for being **too** avowedly pro-war.](https://freebeacon.com/latest-news/pedophile-pulls-out-of-libertarian-anti-war-rally/) That article I linked is obviously biased but the facts it recounts are accurate.

Those are the only circles that will have him since they&#39;re desperate for even the hint of credibility - usually they&#39;ll tout Ritter&#39;s work as a weapons inspector in the late 90&#39;s/early 2000&#39;s and dismiss his criminal convictions as the product of federal conspiracies for the work he did to undermine the Bush administration&#39;s case for war against Iraq. I&#39;m not aware of any other anti-war activists that had under-age sex crime convictions against them, but whatever they need to tell themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Ritter is avowedly a pro-war cheerleader for Russia that heavily favors &quot;evidence&quot; from official MoD statements and pro-RU telegram conspiracy theories over any material facts on the ground. The equivalent on the pro-Ukraine side would be like a pro-Russian Chuck Pfarer - someone that&#39;s found a new career after suffering serious audience capture where their notoriety is based entirely on telling an audience what they want to hear, and damn the actual facts of the matter. </p>\n\n<p>Ritter was actually disinvited from that tankie &quot;anti-war&quot; rally in Washington D.C. a few months back, and contrary to popular belief it wasn&#39;t even because of his sex crime convictions, <a href=\"https://freebeacon.com/latest-news/pedophile-pulls-out-of-libertarian-anti-war-rally/\">it was for being <strong>too</strong> avowedly pro-war.</a> That article I linked is obviously biased but the facts it recounts are accurate. A rally featuring Jackson Hinkle and Tara Reade wouldn&#39;t even have Ritter since he can&#39;t even put up a facade of being anything other than an unabashed Putinist for 5 minutes.</p>\n</div>",
