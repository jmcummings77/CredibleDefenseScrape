Clashes between the majority Meitei and Kuki communities have left more than 100 dead and over 400 wounded. Nearly 60,000 people have been displaced and taken shelter in some 350 camps. Some 40,000 security forces - army soldiers, paramilitaries, police - are struggling to quell the violence. Only a quarter of the more than 4,000 weapons looted by mobs from police armouries have been voluntarily returned since the violence began.\n\nThe level of mistrust between the warring communities has sharpened, with both accusing security forces of being partisan. More than 200 churches and 17 temples have been destroyed or damaged by mobs. Homes of local ministers and legislators have been attacked and set on fire.\n\nIndia's restive and remote north-eastern region is home to some 45 million people belonging to more than 400 communities. More than a dozen peace talks trying to mediate between groups across the region have been dragging on for years. Nestling along the border with Myanmar, Manipur is no stranger to ethnic violence.\n\nWith some 33 ethnic tribes, the state is extremely diverse - and sharply divided. It is home to some 40 insurgent groups. Meitei, Naga and Kuki rebels have waged prolonged armed campaigns, frequently targeting Indian security forces, in protest against controversial anti-insurgent laws such as the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA), which grants search and seizure powers to the security forces. Meitei, Naga and Kuki militias have also fought one another over conflicting homeland demands.\n\nThe underlying tensions in the region stem from a complex interplay of various factors, including a long-standing insurgency, a controversial recent war on drugs, illegal migration from troubled Myanmar through porous borders, pressure on land, and a lack of employment opportunities, which make the young vulnerable to recruitment by rebel groups.\n\nAdding to the volatility, say experts, is the alleged complicity of politicians in the drug trade over decades and the nexus between politicians and militancy.",

        "body": "The fog of war is particularly thick right now, but I'm increasingly convinced that our understanding of the Ukrainian counter-offensive is severely lacking. \n\nKofman and other military analysts like Rob Lee have noted that there is a tendency to associate territorial gains on the ground with progress and success in offensives, for the obvious reason that it's something easy for outside observers to detect and measure. And by that measurement, the Ukrainian counter-offensive hasn't been very successful yet as it hasn't retaken much territory over the past two weeks. \n\nBut that's obviously a flawed measurement. We don't know what the Ukrainian plan is exactly, or what their timetables look like. The expectation is that this offensive will last for months, not weeks, and while there's significant confirmed Ukrainian losses, they aren't *that significant* (somewhere around 100 destroyed or damaged/abandoned armored vehicles). Ukraine obviously isn't launching small probing attacks, but it also clearly hasn't pushed its full reserves into the fighting yet either. \n\nBased on available evidence, the Russian forces are defending well, but Kofman, Lee, and Franz Stefan-Gady noted that they have some of their best remaining units holding the first line of defense (Spetsnaz, naval infantry, VDV, fairly intact Guards units, etc). I find this surprising, as these forward units, while being able to deal major damage to advancing Ukrainian units, are going to be heavily attrited in the process. Russia has been overly reliant on their \"elite\" formations since the very beginning of the war, and they've suffered terribly as a result. If they're the crux of the *first line* of the Russian defense, what happens as these units get worn down? Who will replace them, mobiks? Convicts? \n\nWe also know for a fact that Ukraine is relying heavily on precision guided munitions during the offensive, with both sides reporting the liberal application of HIMARS and Excalibur rounds, in addition to a swarm of FPV drones. In the months preceeding this offensive, usage of these munitions fell drastically, and most (if not all) of the recent US aid packages included these munitions, leading me to believe Ukraine has a lot to use for this offensive (something Kofman seems convinced of). Ukraine hasn't released much footage from the past few weeks, but what they have shown are close to two dozen Russian artillery and MLRS systems knocked out, including a whole Msta-B battery killed by a single HIMARS salvo. We also have seen that Ukraine has been specifically targeting Russian logistics, knocking out two railbridges in/around Crimea, an absolutely massive ammo dump destroyed near Rykove (which also destroyed a large stretch of railroad tracks), and more. \n\nSo my theory is this: Ukraine's plan is to heavily engage Russian forces on multiple fronts, getting the Russians to commit sizeable forces to defend each (not knowing which is the primary target of the offensive), stretching themselves thin in the process, while Ukraine uses its precision fires to heavily attrit frontline units and second line support units, all while disrupting Russian supplies in the South/Southwest. In other words, we're in the attrition phase of the offensive, with Ukraine hoping to soften up Russian forces enough to exploit a breakthrough somewhere along the line, which will be exploited by some of the Western-equipped brigades currently being held in reserve. \n\nFor their part, I find it interesting that Russian forces are so tenaciously defending the territory immediately proceeding their first line of defense. Small villages like P'yatkhatky have seen *several* armored Russian counterattacks already, despite the town being in front of the first Russian defensive line. Kofman noted his confusion with Russian tactics, as they're tenaciously defending and counterattacking territory that they should be willing to give up as part of a mobile defense or defense in depth strategy. I wonder if the Russian strategy is explicitly to try to win in the public information sphere (\"look, the long anticipated Ukrainian counter-offensive featuring Western tanks and IFVs can't even reach our first line of defense more than two weeks in, how can they ever hope to breach it!?\") by committing their best units to the first line of defense, and by launching so many localized counterattacks to slow Ukrainian progress to a crawl. But such a strategy has the potential to backfire in a big way if Russian \"elite\" units (who are going to be the tip of the spear for the next Russian offensive btw) are mauled and in their place mobiks and convicts are sent to try to hold off Ukrainian armored advances with minimal equipment, poor training, and low morale. \n\nMaybe this is just cope on my part, and the offensive really is nothing but a costly boondoggle for Ukraine. But I'm not convinced this is the case, and if this war has taught me anything over the past 16 months, it's not to underestimate Ukrainian offensive potential or the ability of Russian command to commit terrible strategic blunders for political reasons.",

People forget that there was more than a month of fighting in Kherson before the first Ukrainian breakthrough. So this is already proving more successful than that. \n\n>Also, another measurement of progress is the combat losses of both side, and based on Oryx I'd say things are going okay for an offensive operation without air superiority against heavy fortification\n\nYeah I think so too. When Russia was at the height of its winter offensive, they were suffering something like 3-1 losses against Ukraine in terms of materiel, which dropped to around 2-1 or 1.5-1 during the grind through Bakhmut (mostly because Russian infantry did all the hard work, and Ukraine lost a lot of kit trying to keep supply lines open). For Ukraine to be suffering something like 1.5-1 losses against Russia while driving into the teeth of Russian fortified lines is quite striking imo. \n\nThe real questions I have is who is really suffering more casualties (were only seeing a fraction from both sides) and who can sustain it for longer. If the attrition is even somewhat favorable for Ukraine, which it very well might be, we could see them weaken Russian lines enough for a true breakthrough in the coming weeks.",

But I'm not convinced that's completely accurate, the fighting is way too fierce for this to simply be Russians retreating after offering light resistance, pasting the position, and then Russian forces rolling back into town as claimed. \n\nAs to the rest of your post, that's where the fog of war is thickest. You say Ukraine has committed 5-6 brigades, but all we can confirm is that *elements* of those units have been involved in fighting. There's little evidence that tens of thousands of Ukrainian troops are pushing along these fronts, which was my original point. That while Ukraine isn't launching probing attacks, it also clearly isn't launching massed assaults and committing a large percentage of its reserve units. It seems to be somewhere in between, where they're engaging Russia along multiple axis, but at a relatively low intensity of fighting compared with the number of units theoretically engaged. \n\nAgain, I could be very wrong here but that's my interpretation. Until we have a better picture of the balance of forces, the ability of both sides to sustain current fighting intensity, and the balance of attrition, its hard to know how things will develop.",

        "body": "This probably doesn't apply that well to the big conflict we're all agonizing over these days, but I've been pondering something for a few weeks now. It's also a little open-ended so please bear with me.\n\nA while back a friend of mine gave me a bilingual edition of [this book](https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/LIB100046272) (I'm learning Greek and why not). This is basically the war diary of James De Mole Carstairs, an Australian officer who was present at the Battle of Crete. His unit was one of the rearguard units that screened the retreat and evacuation of the bulk of the Allied troops, and subsequently remained stranded on the island. The stranded troops were allowed to surrender, but Carstairs and his men were some of the many Allied groups who chose not to, and instead decided to take their chance on Crete and try to evade capture while securing other means of evacuation.\n\nCarstairs and his group (5-8 people in total, for most of the time -- they did make contact with other soldiers from time to time) evaded German capture from June to November 1941, when they managed to escape.\n\nThe story of this evasion is very interesting. If you've ever been to Crete, you know that its geography is very beautiful, that is to say, absolutely atrocious from a military standpoint, it's extremely rough, arrid terrain, littered with caves and full of steep climbs. Tourism and general population mobility have changed this since then to some degree, but back in 1941 it would've also been fairly difficult even for native Greek speakers to blend in with the local population in the countryside due to the difference in language (*that* one is still on) and customs and the tight social structure that this rough geography imposed. Furthermore, the local population in the countryside was generally active over large areas -- they raised sheep and goats, and shepherders frequently travelled over large distances, had huts and cave shelters all over the place and so on.\n\nSo these people managed to hide from the Germans for almost six months, even though they were on a bloody island. They dodged a lot of patrols, especially near larger villages; and as German troops stepped up not just their intelligence efforts, but also their reprisals, they also had to leave some of the safer shelters provided by the local population.\n\nNonetheless, a good portion of this time was spent hiding from patrols, *observing* nearby patrols, and travelling between inland shelters through very unfriendly, poorly-accessible routes. \n\nEventually, with the help of the local resistance movements, Carstairs managed to evacuate not only his people, but almost eighty others, in what is probably the even more remarkable feat -- they managed to getnearly a hundred people to march to, and then make a camp that was concealed from the German military, over the course of several days.\n\nNow for my questions (finally!):\n\n1. What kind of surveillance equipment, and in what numbers, would it take to negate the geographical advantage of a similarly rough, but inhabited environment? I realize it's likely impossible to negate this on equipment alone -- it's not like you can tell four shephers from one sheepherd and three Aussies dressed like shepherds from a drone, you also need boots on the ground -- but what kind of equipment would it take to make the boots stand a chance?\n2. What kind of evasion techniques are efficient in such a scenario? A trivial example: Carstairs and his men frequently travelled by night (which is a feat of its own, even mild terrain, by Cretan standards, is difficult to travel *by day*), which was obviously super useful in 1941 but probably less so today.\n3. A major problem the German occupation authorities had -- at least during the period and in the locations Carstairs' journal covers -- was that patrolling the extremely rough countryside was difficult and, in many areas, outright impossible, or at least impossible without substantial local aid, which was a security nightmare. So they could keep the coast areas under control but further inland things were iffy. Short of aerial surveillance, are there other modern means of surveillance that would alleviate this in a modern setting?\n\nEdit: FWIW, that's a pretty interesting book. My questions are concerned with just one of the many interesting facts I've read there, it's a treasure trove of interesting first-hand accounts on millitary intelligence (and intelligence work in general), evasion, military leadership, culture, and many others. I wholeheartedly recommend it. It don't know if it's available online, but the bilingual edition I have should be easy enough to find in museum stores or bookshops in more touristy areas of Greece (and Crete in particular).",

Short of aerial surveillance, are there other modern means of surveillance that would alleviate this in a modern setting?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Edit: FWIW, that&#39;s a pretty interesting book. My questions are concerned with just one of the many interesting facts I&#39;ve read there, it&#39;s a treasure trove of interesting first-hand accounts on millitary intelligence (and intelligence work in general), evasion, military leadership, culture, and many others. I wholeheartedly recommend it. It don&#39;t know if it&#39;s available online, but the bilingual edition I have should be easy enough to find in museum stores or bookshops in more touristy areas of Greece (and Crete in particular).</p>\n</div>",

In WW2 there were no helicopters; today, a QRF could get pretty much anywhere in minutes.\n\nThere's also much better radio and maps now. Then, if anything was seen, a patrol would have to be either found and contacted by a runner, or sent out from home base rather than being redirected from a nearby route, and they'd have substantially more trouble navigating to the reported position. Now, any patrol can be immediately retasked, can coordinate with other patrols, and can navigate much more easily.\n\nSo I would say drone overwatch, with helicopter-borne patrols dispatched to check out anything the drones spot. Numbers depend on the size of the area to cover, but presumably you'd want to have multiple drones up and multiple helicopters available. At a certain point the size of the area may outstrip what's practical to cover, though - there's a big difference between a Crete scenario and, say, Afghanistan.\n\nAs for evasion, I don't think there's much you can do that Carstairs and co. weren't already doing. You might hope for thermal blankets to hide under, but in an escape-and-evade situation you may not have the luxury of picking the ideal loadout.

Basically how much do the Chinese run their ships, how willing are they to do maintenance, will they accept long term deployment disruptions due to major overhauls, etc.? The big problem with the Soviet Navy was that they *really* didn\u2019t like to port their ships for refits, and never budgeted money for big overhauls. I\u2019ve also read that captains weren\u2019t motivated to get the crew to do underway maintenance.

Will they accept a two year deployability gap when their first CVs need a new boiler? And are the crews actually willing to do the little stuff? It\u2019s not an east problem, the German Navy has famously recently struggled with this. Historically the Chinese Navy has likewise really struggled with much the same issues as the Russian.

        "body": "https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1671504581832974336.html\n\n> \n> @holger_r and I spoke to Karl, the Estonian military analyst. His thoughts on the Ukrainian counteroffensive, the Kakhovka Dam, and Belgorod: \ud83e\uddf5\n> The last time we spoke, I came to the conclusion that Ukraine is showing the first signs of activation on the fronts. Now this activation has increased. In addition to attacks in the rear, they are also carrying out cautious attempts at a ground offensive.\n> \n> For the time being, progress is scarce. A few tens of square kilometers have been liberated. This is only natural given how long it took to liberate Kherson from the moment the first attacks were launched there.\n> \n> If last year's situation is anything to go by, the first signs that Ukraine had started land attacks towards Kherson came in early August. The liberation of Kherson was achieved on November 11, more than three months later. The area was much much narrower.\n> \n> In southern Ukraine, it may take longer, as the area is larger and logistically still covered by Russia. When the Kherson bridges were destroyed, the Russians had a very difficult logistical situation there. In the south, the Russians now also have difficulties.\n> \n> Ukraine has been able to successfully attack Russian railways in both southern Ukraine and Crimea for the last 2-3 weeks. Blowing up a railway is not that severe, it can be rebuilt in a few days.\n> \n> But a large railway bridge was blown up between Melitopol and Dzhankoi in northern Crimea. This means that there is no rail access to Melitopol. Reloading will have to be done again farther away from the railway line, making it all technically more difficult.\n> \n> If you look at the fronts, there are two areas where Ukraine has made significant progress. At Velyka Novosilka they have managed to advance 7-8 kilometers. They've also advanced several kilometers around Bakhmut on both sides, from the north and the south.\n> \n> There is no longer any danger that the Russians could advance from there.\n> \n> Rather, if Ukraine is able to build on its progress, Russian units could face major problems inside Bakhmut. There could be a danger that the Ukrainian flanks are already more to the east than the Russian-controlled town.\n> \n> There has also been some advance by Ukraine from the Orikhiv direction southwards towards Zaporizhia, but progress there is less.\n> \n> Ukraine is far from having deployed all of its reserve units to the battle. At the moment it is not a massive offensive. It would be a lot to hope for a repeat of what happened in Kharkiv last year, with the Ukraine taking back territory the size of Estonia in five days.\n> \n> The element of surprise as to where the Ukrainian offensive would now come from was not possible. The Russians were waiting from all directions. Only Donetsk would have been a surprise, as it has very strong fortifications.\n> \n> When the large offensive starts depends on where the Russian troops will start to break down, how the Russian logistics will work, how much artillery ammo and artillery Russia has down there. Suppressing enemy artillery fire is a big priority for Ukraine.\n> \n> Without it, it will be very difficult to retake territory.

His thoughts on the Ukrainian counteroffensive, the Kakhovka Dam, and Belgorod: \ud83e\uddf5\nThe last time we spoke, I came to the conclusion that Ukraine is showing the first signs of activation on the fronts. Now this activation has increased. In addition to attacks in the rear, they are also carrying out cautious attempts at a ground offensive.</p>\n\n<p>For the time being, progress is scarce. A few tens of square kilometers have been liberated. This is only natural given how long it took to liberate Kherson from the moment the first attacks were launched there.</p>\n\n<p>If last year&#39;s situation is anything to go by, the first signs that Ukraine had started land attacks towards Kherson came in early August. The liberation of Kherson was achieved on November 11, more than three months later. The area was much much narrower.</p>\n\n<p>In southern Ukraine, it may take longer, as the area is larger and logistically still covered by Russia. When the Kherson bridges were destroyed, the Russians had a very difficult logistical situation there. In the south, the Russians now also have difficulties.</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine has been able to successfully attack Russian railways in both southern Ukraine and Crimea for the last 2-3 weeks. Blowing up a railway is not that severe, it can be rebuilt in a few days.</p>\n\n<p>But a large railway bridge was blown up between Melitopol and Dzhankoi in northern Crimea. This means that there is no rail access to Melitopol. Reloading will have to be done again farther away from the railway line, making it all technically more difficult.</p>\n\n<p>If you look at the fronts, there are two areas where Ukraine has made significant progress. At Velyka Novosilka they have managed to advance 7-8 kilometers. They&#39;ve also advanced several kilometers around Bakhmut on both sides, from the north and the south.</p>\n\n<p>There is no longer any danger that the Russians could advance from there.</p>\n\n<p>Rather, if Ukraine is able to build on its progress, Russian units could face major problems inside Bakhmut. There could be a danger that the Ukrainian flanks are already more to the east than the Russian-controlled town.</p>\n\n<p>There has also been some advance by Ukraine from the Orikhiv direction southwards towards Zaporizhia, but progress there is less.</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine is far from having deployed all of its reserve units to the battle. At the moment it is not a massive offensive. It would be a lot to hope for a repeat of what happened in Kharkiv last year, with the Ukraine taking back territory the size of Estonia in five days.</p>\n\n<p>The element of surprise as to where the Ukrainian offensive would now come from was not possible. The Russians were waiting from all directions. Only Donetsk would have been a surprise, as it has very strong fortifications.</p>\n\n<p>When the large offensive starts depends on where the Russian troops will start to break down, how the Russian logistics will work, how much artillery ammo and artillery Russia has down there. Suppressing enemy artillery fire is a big priority for Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>Without it, it will be very difficult to retake territory. In that case there would be hordes of corpses.</p>\n\n<p>Russians have suffered heavy artillery losses recently. Only yesterday 31 more were destroyed. In the normal phase of the war, the average was maybe 4-5 a day. Lately, it&#39;s over 10, over 20, over 30.</p>\n\n<p>The destruction of the Kahhovka dam has been a major source of concern for the Ukrainians. And also the Western media&#39;s fake balanced attitude. There is also enough information today to be convinced that it was the Russians who did it.</p>\n\n<p>If there had been a Ukrainian missile strike, U.S. satellites would have shown it very well.</p>\n\n<p>The informed working version is currently as follows.

                    "body": "Neither side has performed classic offensive Soviet operational theory, which was based on massed attacks at weak points, with entire second echelons of huge forces called an Operational Maneuver Group to exploit (typically field army sized). That said, they both love them some broad front attacks, and that's a very Soviet infatuation.  \n\nAt the tactical level, both are routinely using Soviet tactics on the offense and defense. Offensively, both routinely use [Reconnaissance in Force](https://www.moore.army.mil/armor/eArmor/content/issues/2018/Winter-Spring/2Grau18.pdf) probing attacks, and [Reconnaissance Fire Complex](https://www.ccw.ox.ac.uk/blog/2018/5/30/the-russian-reconnaissance-fire-complex-comes-of-age). Defensively, both use Soviet doctrine in designing their lines (Russia more than Ukraine), both use[Maneuver Defense](https://www.moore.army.mil/armor/earmor/content/issues/2021/Spring/2Grau_Bartles21.pdf) at times when they're politically allowed. \n\nAll the talk of NATO air power is predominantly by people who misunderstand air power and what it actually does. \n\nDefensively over friendly controlled territory it denies enemy aircraft any freedom of movement to conduct deep attacks or reconnaissance, a role that can be replicated by ground based air defenses and electronic warfare to target enemy drone ISR. \n\nOffensively it gains air superiority which is only useful to perform different level of ground attacks, strategic bombing and tactical bombing. Strategic bombing in this war is being done extensively by long range PGM missiles and drones, especially by the Russians, but it's lack of effects points to long known issues with strategic bombing doctrine as a whole, that pretty much every previous war has reinforced: while it weakens an enemy it almost never does what it intends and ends the war itself (hence why it's called strategic).\n\nTactical strikes range from close air support (a mission the USAF is legally bound to do but does everything they can to avoid) and deep air support, aka air interdiction, which is striking behind the front lines in the tactical and operational level rear areas of the enemy (~150 km), going after command and control, supply, or any military targets identified worth striking. In this war, the effects of CAS are replicated with a mix of artillery, PGM rockets, and FPV drones. Air interdiction is largely limited to strikes on stationary targets by long range PGM rockets, missiles, and drones.\n\nNATO air power would likely gain air superiority in  war like this but unlikely air supremacy and almost certainly not air  dominance like Desert Storm, simply because Russian (and Ukrainian too) GBAD is actually pretty good. What would likely occur is that US led NATO SEAD/DEAD campaign would likely start out with great success but then the enemy would adopt a pop up tactic, moving constantly and only turning on radars momentarily to hit NATO aircraft when they are known to be in the area (Serbia did this in '99 with decent success). Without Russian GBAD on 24/7, NATO would have more freedom to conduct deep strikes but would also suffer heavy attrition due, which aren't set up to take (USAF=/=Wagner). \n\nBut air support still isn't getting ground forces through the obstacles.

When the attack started, CENTCOM and CIA both rated their strength at ~50% between casualties and desertions, which were extremely prevalent. This war is NOTHING like that one.",
                    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Neither side has performed classic offensive Soviet operational theory, which was based on massed attacks at weak points, with entire second echelons of huge forces called an Operational Maneuver Group to exploit (typically field army sized). That said, they both love them some broad front attacks, and that&#39;s a very Soviet infatuation.  </p>\n\n<p>At the tactical level, both are routinely using Soviet tactics on the offense and defense. Offensively, both routinely use <a href=\"https://www.moore.army.mil/armor/eArmor/content/issues/2018/Winter-Spring/2Grau18.pdf\">Reconnaissance in Force</a> probing attacks, and <a href=\"https://www.ccw.ox.ac.uk/blog/2018/5/30/the-russian-reconnaissance-fire-complex-comes-of-age\">Reconnaissance Fire Complex</a>. Defensively, both use Soviet doctrine in designing their lines (Russia more than Ukraine), both use<a href=\"https://www.moore.army.mil/armor/earmor/content/issues/2021/Spring/2Grau_Bartles21.pdf\">Maneuver Defense</a> at times when they&#39;re politically allowed. </p>\n\n<p>All the talk of NATO air power is predominantly by people who misunderstand air power and what it actually does. </p>\n\n<p>Defensively over friendly controlled territory it denies enemy aircraft any freedom of movement to conduct deep attacks or reconnaissance, a role that can be replicated by ground based air defenses and electronic warfare to target enemy drone ISR. </p>\n\n<p>Offensively it gains air superiority which is only useful to perform different level of ground attacks, strategic bombing and tactical bombing. Strategic bombing in this war is being done extensively by long range PGM missiles and drones, especially by the Russians, but it&#39;s lack of effects points to long known issues with strategic bombing doctrine as a whole, that pretty much every previous war has reinforced: while it weakens an enemy it almost never does what it intends and ends the war itself (hence why it&#39;s called strategic).</p>\n\n<p>Tactical strikes range from close air support (a mission the USAF is legally bound to do but does everything they can to avoid) and deep air support, aka air interdiction, which is striking behind the front lines in the tactical and operational level rear areas of the enemy (~150 km), going after command and control, supply, or any military targets identified worth striking. In this war, the effects of CAS are replicated with a mix of artillery, PGM rockets, and FPV drones. Air interdiction is largely limited to strikes on stationary targets by long range PGM rockets, missiles, and drones.</p>\n\n<p>NATO air power would likely gain air superiority in  war like this but unlikely air supremacy and almost certainly not air  dominance like Desert Storm, simply because Russian (and Ukrainian too) GBAD is actually pretty good. What would likely occur is that US led NATO SEAD/DEAD campaign would likely start out with great success but then the enemy would adopt a pop up tactic, moving constantly and only turning on radars momentarily to hit NATO aircraft when they are known to be in the area (Serbia did this in &#39;99 with decent success). Without Russian GBAD on 24/7, NATO would have more freedom to conduct deep strikes but would also suffer heavy attrition due, which aren&#39;t set up to take (USAF=/=Wagner). </p>\n\n<p>But air support still isn&#39;t getting ground forces through the obstacles. It&#39;ll help with recon, help attrit the defending units more than arty or GMLRS/drones, have more success targeting Russian forces moving in the rear area conducting road marches or moved by rail, but it would still take heavy losses doing it, still have difficulty breaking through.</p>\n\n<p>In 1991, the Iraqi Army infantry units manning the Saddam Line fortifications had really terrible air defenses and were left out there for a month and a half getting hit regularly with their supply lines mostly cut and communication cut/jammed before the ground assault started.

It's not,\" he told the BBC. \"What's at stake is people's lives.\"\n\n> Ukraine says its counter-offensive has reclaimed eight villages so far in the southern region of Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk to the east. Mr Zelensky said the military push was not going easily because 200,000 sq km (77,220 sq miles) of Ukrainian territory had been mined by Russian forces.\n\n> \"Whatever some might want, including attempts to pressure us, with all due respect, we will advance on the battlefield the way we deem best,\" Mr Zelensky added.\n\nKind of statement that you would expect from Zelensky under the circumstances, but all makes sense.\n\nBecause that's not much news to go on, I'll also add a different bit of news, from the Guardian, relating to reconstruction:\n\n[Ukraine lacks capacity to process huge sums in aid, official admits\n](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/20/ukraine-lacks-capacity-to-process-huge-sums-in-aid-official-admits)\n\nNot the greatest fan of the headline, but the piece itself is fine.\n\n> Ukraine will struggle to absorb the expected billions of western private and public sector aid for its recovery not due to corruption, but a simple lack of capacity to process and invest such huge sums, a senior Ukraine official has said on the eve of the UK-sponsored Ukraine recovery conference in London.\n\n> \u201cIt is about the capacity to work with this amount of money,\u201d said Mustafa Nayyem, the head of the Ukraine State Agency for Restoration and Infrastructure Development.\n\n> During the two-day conference, the EU will make a pledge to spend \u20ac50bn (\u00a342.8bn) in grants and loans over the next four years largely to keep government services afloat. The UK will offer multibillion-pound export guarantees to the World Bank and pledge to use the sophisticated London insurance markets to develop a form of war insurance to protect western investments. The US is also to announce a significant economic aid package. The central aim of the conference, which will be attended by 1,000 delegates, is not pledge-making, but instead to stimulate private sector investment in Ukraine. The World Bank in March estimated that Ukraine faced a $430bn (\u00a3337bn) bill to replace its damaged buildings.\n\n> Nayyem, who was appointed to run the Ukrainian reconstruction agency in January and was one of the first Facebook organisers of the Maidan revolution in 2014, said it would be a challenge for Ukraine to process such huge sums.\n\n> \u201cIt is about the capacity to work with this amount of money. Historically the largest amount of money we have been capable of working with was $6bn a year in 2014. Now we are expecting much more, and it will be very difficult for the Ukrainian construction industry, government institutions and private institutions to deliver this result. It is not that the Ukrainians are bad, or corrupt. Show me the country that can do it.\u201d\n\n> Nayyem said he already had 2,000 staff working in the regions, but admitted to a structural problem if reconstruction was exclusively directed locally. Less damaged and better-staffed cities had already submitted more claims to rebuild schools than more badly damaged eastern regions. After studying the regional distribution of initial bids for school reconstructions, he said: \u201cI thought the war was fought in the west and not the east.\u201d\n\nThe kind of problem you don't normally think about with regards to aid, but I suppose it makes sense. These things have to be well directed and managed, and when you're looking at the large amounts of aid pledged to Ukraine, I can see how that can be a challenge.\n\nThe article has a lot of good quotes from him talking about \"just because this is a problem, doesn't mean we shouldn't get aid\". I'm not posting all of them because it would get repetitive, the article is worth reading. \n\nOh, and the recovery conference website is [here to read](https://www.urc-international.com/ukraine-recovery-conference-urc-2023?s=03)",
