As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

A lot. And it's a signal he won't back down in the GOP debate over future aid. \nMcConnell\u2019s stand sets him at odds with other Republican members and presidential candidates.\n\n>**What happened**: When Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell offered a different floor speech about Ukraine every working day this week, he was signaling \u2014 amid a rift with fellow Republicans on continued military aid \u2014 that he\u2019s not backing down.\n\n>**What he said**: Without mentioning a Republican split, McConnell on Monday talked about how Ukraine military aid supports American workers and troops. On Tuesday, it was about NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg\u2019s Washington visit and allied burden-sharing. Wednesday: how helping Ukraine deters China. Thursday: Germany\u2019s growing defense spending.\n\n>\u201cAmerica\u2019s support for Ukraine has done much more than sustain their defense. As I\u2019ve said repeatedly, sending lethal Western capabilities to the front lines has been a direct investment in America\u2019s own security. \u2026 Let me be clear: this assistance means more jobs for American workers and newer weapons for American service members.\u201d \u2014 Sen. Mitch McConnell, on Monday\n\n>**Why it matters**: The Ukraine remarks highlight Washington\u2019s grueling three-way fiscal fight.\n\n>With Senate Democrats poised to offer spending bills that match the levels of the bipartisan debt limit deal, House Republicans swerved right in order to offer a plan for significantly lower non-defense spending \u2014 while McConnell is dug in behind hawks who want a supplemental for Ukraine and defense.\n\n>The remarks came a week after House Speaker Kevin McCarthy \u2014 who is under pressure from conservatives to limit spending \u2014 said his chamber has no plans to take up supplemental spending legislation that would boost aid to Ukraine and other defense spending above the deal levels.\n\n>The Senate\u2019s No. 2 Republican, John Thune, said McConnell \u201cfeels very strongly\u201d about stopping Russian aggression and America\u2019s leadership in NATO and the world. \u201cI think he's just staking out ground and making it very clear what his intentions are with respect to that issue, if and when there's a need for additional assistance,\u201d Thune said.\n\n>**Republican split**: McConnell\u2019s stand not only sets him at odds with some other GOP members, but also with former President Donald Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and other Republican presidential candidates who oppose further Ukraine aid\n\n>\u201cWhat it does is maintain the support that he and other Republicans have already demonstrated and it also at least indirectly questions Trump\u2019s approach and Ron DeSantis\u2019 approach, which is ignoring Ukraine as not important,\u201d Senate Armed Services Chair Jack Reed (D-R.I.) told POLITICO.\n\n>**Who\u2019s listening?** Two opponents of new Ukraine aid in the Senate, J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), said McConnell\u2019s remarks hadn\u2019t changed their minds. Vance argued the aid was fueling \u201can indefinite \u2026 war,\u201d which is against America\u2019s interests.\n\nSo there is still a Senate GOP heavyweight pushing for Ukraine in McConnell, and he can likely get enough votes to join with Democrats to pass continued support. The House is another matter.",

And it&#39;s a signal he won&#39;t back down in the GOP debate over future aid. \nMcConnell\u2019s stand sets him at odds with other Republican members and presidential candidates.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What happened</strong>: When Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell offered a different floor speech about Ukraine every working day this week, he was signaling \u2014 amid a rift with fellow Republicans on continued military aid \u2014 that he\u2019s not backing down.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What he said</strong>: Without mentioning a Republican split, McConnell on Monday talked about how Ukraine military aid supports American workers and troops. On Tuesday, it was about NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg\u2019s Washington visit and allied burden-sharing. Wednesday: how helping Ukraine deters China. Thursday: Germany\u2019s growing defense spending.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAmerica\u2019s support for Ukraine has done much more than sustain their defense. As I\u2019ve said repeatedly, sending lethal Western capabilities to the front lines has been a direct investment in America\u2019s own security. \u2026 Let me be clear: this assistance means more jobs for American workers and newer weapons for American service members.\u201d \u2014 Sen. Mitch McConnell, on Monday</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why it matters</strong>: The Ukraine remarks highlight Washington\u2019s grueling three-way fiscal fight.</p>\n\n<p>With Senate Democrats poised to offer spending bills that match the levels of the bipartisan debt limit deal, House Republicans swerved right in order to offer a plan for significantly lower non-defense spending \u2014 while McConnell is dug in behind hawks who want a supplemental for Ukraine and defense.</p>\n\n<p>The remarks came a week after House Speaker Kevin McCarthy \u2014 who is under pressure from conservatives to limit spending \u2014 said his chamber has no plans to take up supplemental spending legislation that would boost aid to Ukraine and other defense spending above the deal levels.</p>\n\n<p>The Senate\u2019s No. 2 Republican, John Thune, said McConnell \u201cfeels very strongly\u201d about stopping Russian aggression and America\u2019s leadership in NATO and the world. \u201cI think he&#39;s just staking out ground and making it very clear what his intentions are with respect to that issue, if and when there&#39;s a need for additional assistance,\u201d Thune said.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Republican split</strong>: McConnell\u2019s stand not only sets him at odds with some other GOP members, but also with former President Donald Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and other Republican presidential candidates who oppose further Ukraine aid</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat it does is maintain the support that he and other Republicans have already demonstrated and it also at least indirectly questions Trump\u2019s approach and Ron DeSantis\u2019 approach, which is ignoring Ukraine as not important,\u201d Senate Armed Services Chair Jack Reed (D-R.I.) told POLITICO.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who\u2019s listening?</strong> Two opponents of new Ukraine aid in the Senate, J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), said McConnell\u2019s remarks hadn\u2019t changed their minds. Vance argued the aid was fueling \u201can indefinite \u2026 war,\u201d which is against America\u2019s interests.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So there is still a Senate GOP heavyweight pushing for Ukraine in McConnell, and he can likely get enough votes to join with Democrats to pass continued support. The House is another matter.</p>\n</div>",

They're valuable because they're more highly skilled and harder to replace, he needs them to keep Wagner working in the long run, keep making him money, keep the reputation high but that's it. They're just tools to this guy. The more valuable PMC are meant to live because dead contractors can't work. But that's the limit of his compassion. \n\nNobody is capable of doing what he's done to the excons and be a caring human, it's impossible. I'm a devout student of military history, what Wagner has done will be in the history books forever, and not in an impressive way. Again, this guy personally recruited tens of thousands of men so they could die in the most callous way in modern military history.

Grain exports are not just important for their economy, which is suffering tremendously on account of the war, they're also a significant torn in Putin's side. Remind a Russian nationalist about the grain deal and they'll bo berserk: it's a painful and uncomfortable reminder that even in matters of (ostensibly) existential threats to national security, Russian foreign policy is, if not subordinated to, at least constrained by, interests in Beijing. The Soviet Union could once interdict anything east of the Bosphorus. Russia can't, and not because it lacks the maritime power to do so, but because it's got an *ally* that won't allow it, unless Russia can secure some other grain source for its clients -- which it can't, because it's alienated just about every country that could supply it.\n\nThis is probably the biggest and most important point. Ukraine really needs that grain deal, too.\n\nSecond, it's good diplomatic practice. Someone wants to send a delegation, you receive it. Doing otherwise would just invite \"Zelensky says no to peace!\" hysteria. Better yet, this is a show of support that is, or should be, deeply embarassing to the delegation countries. It's a delegation of countries that back up Russia's rhetoric about the neo-Nazi evil racist West, but the delegation was received just like any other European delegation. Meanwhile, if you think being black in Ohio sucks, try being slightly brown in Kursk, or muslim -- like the Egyptian delegation -- in Xinjiang.\n\nThird, it's a useful reminder of who needs to do what. Ukraine has the grain, and it's willing to export it. The only barrier towards African governments getting the food they need is Russia, not Ukraine. Their food supply wouldn't be in jeopardy if Russia hadn't gone all \"ten-day special military operation\" an year and a half ago, and all that needs to happen for it to stop being in jeopardy is for Putin to recall his troops. Reminding the world that Ukraine isn't impeding this effort at all, that they're in fact more than willing to do business with African nations (and China), and that it's Russian policy that's preventing this from going smoothly, is an important point of this exercise.",

They are fuelled by avgas so have a very good energy density and range vs electric power. By the time you have some kind of drone with the speed and range you are basically better off having built a missile anyway. \n\nPower demand scales exponentially with speed. So it takes 4 times the power to double the speed, but that extra power will come with need for bigger engines so more mass and drag. So  you very quickly hit speeds and sizes where electric drones have no real use. \n\nSolid rocket fuel is cheap and can be mass produced. \n\nThe Ka 52s seem to have found an envelope last week, where they were far away enough to evade the man held sams, high enough to see the battle space while being just low enough to evade the longer range fixed stuff. A lot of aerial warfare is like this, finding envelopes of vulnerability you can operate in (rather than all the top gun thrashing the plane around). This is sort of where the Iranian drones fit in, they are petrol powered (good fuel density) and fitted into flight envelopes that Ukraine's creaking Soviet air defences were not really set up for. But its also why so many \"game changer\" technologies rapdily just become another set of envelopes to avoid. I.e. SA-2 bringing down U-2 did not end the aircraft, just change the operating envelope (dragged everything to the deck).",

The sanctions are aimed at bank and financial transactions, technology imports, manufacturing and Russians with government connections.\n\nAdeyemo said most recently the Kremlin's new tax on oil companies, designed to make up for the lack of revenues, is evidence of the cap's success.\n\n\u201cThis change will constrain Russia\u2019s oil companies going forward, leaving them with fewer funds to invest in exploration and production and over time diminishing the productive capacity of Russia\u2019s oil sector,\" he said. \u201cThere is clear evidence of its success.\"\n\nLauri Myllyvirta, a Finland-based analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, said while the price cap has made an impact on Russia\u2019s economy, the EU\u2019s import ban has had more effect in reducing Russian oil revenues.\n\nThe EU last year announced a ban on the importation of Russian oil and other products from Russian refineries. And in February, Europe imposed a ban on Russian diesel fuel.\n\n\u201cThe combination of the EU's oil import ban and the price cap did have an impact,\u201d Myllyvirta said, \u201cbut the EU import ban has been the more impactful measure.\u201d\n\nMyllyvirta also said the cap is too high for to have a more meaningful impact on Russian oil revenues. The price cap on Russian oil has remained at $60 per barrel.\n\nIn response to the punitive measures, Russia has cut its oil production, and announced this month that it would extend the cuts by 500,000 barrels per day until the end of December 2024.\n\n\u201cThis is a precautionary measure taken in coordination with the countries participating in the OPEC+ agreement, which previously announced voluntary oil cuts in April,\u201d Alexander Novak, Russia\u2019s deputy prime minister, wrote on the government\u2019s website.\n\nThe voluntary cuts may also be due in part to waning demand.\n\nThe International Energy Agency this week issued its five-year forecast on oil demand, which suggests that fossil fuels\u2019 dominance over drivers is starting to wane.\n\nIt\u2019s part of a larger trend in which countries\u2019 efforts to address climate change by moving to renewable energy sources will begin to lessen demand, which in turn could lessen the economic strength of countries like Russia.\n\nThe forecast indicates that demand for gasoline will peak in 2023, while demand for overall transport fuels would top out in 2026. The IEA specifies that this is \u201cthe result of a pivot towards lower-emission sources triggered by the global energy crisis,\u201d in addition to better efficiency and the growth in sales of electric vehicles.",

        "body": "Putin and the far right in many western countries continue attacking Zelensky who lost family in the Holocaust as anti-Jewish.\n\n[Putin again falsely claims that Nazis control Ukraine](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/06/16/world/russia-ukraine-news/putin-again-falsely-claims-that-nazis-control-ukraine-and-says-kyivs-offensive-has-no-chance?smid=url-share)\n________________________________________________________\n\nIn a speech to Russia\u2019s signature annual economic forum, President Vladimir V. Putin largely ignored the war in Ukraine, but then during a question-and-answer session, he doubled down on his false accusation that Ukraine has been riddled with Nazi sympathizers since World War II.\n\nAsked about the recently launched Ukrainian counteroffensive, Mr. Putin said that Ukrainian troops had reached the first line of Russian defenses in some places but maintained they had suffered much higher losses than Russia. He said Ukraine\u2019s forces had \u201cno chance.\u201d\n\n**Mr. Putin has repeatedly, and falsely, described Ukraine as a Nazi state and used that claim to justify his illegal invasion.** When he was asked on Friday about his goal of \u201cdenazification,\u201d he relied on similar stereotypes and false allegations.\n\nFirst, he took aim at President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, who is Jewish. \u201cI have had many Jewish friends since childhood,\u201d Mr. Putin said. \u201cThey say Zelensky is not a Jew.

Before 2014, the Black and Red flag was only  somewhat common in Western Ukraine, but as it was forced during the Maidan movement, it changed its meaning to a lot of Ukrainians, or maybe reinforced the old meaning, you could say. I'm talking about it representing Ukrainians fighting their oppressors - the Soviets or Russians or subordinates to Moscow basically. Using it as a symbol of protestors' wishes to go different ways with Russia politically cemented it in this meaning. \n\nNow, one thing I was saying on Reddit years back before this war began is the fact that Ukrainians are simply not educated about bad connotations these symbols (UPA, Bandera, the Flag) had in the past. To the people of Western Ukraine, who were using them before 2014, it was always about a struggle for freedom, their ancestors fought for it, the villagers often hid UPA fighters from the Soviets in their houses or nearby woods. It was a decade long partisan war stretched to the 50s after WW2 was long over and that's exactly what they remember and tell their children about - not the crimes against Poles or Jews in the 40s. You have to remember that core of Western Ukraine in Galicia wasn't even part of Russia or Russian Empire before 1939 and the Soviets to them were literally the same occupiers that the Nazis were. They also started a huge propaganda campaign against those partisans, which in Eastern Ukraine was swallowed as a whole and in Western Ukraine led to distrust to even factual information about UPA's crimes, that are sometimes referred to as \"the Soviet myths\".\n\n So in the end, people simply projected this anti-Russian meaning of those symbols to the modern times in 2014, while choosing to think that the part where they were fighting\\massacring Poles was a whole different conversation. And to be truthful, while no doubt Ukrainians should be educated about their past crimes, I can understand the frustration of Western Ukrainians on this topic, because while everyone is aware about Ukrainian massacre of Poles, not many know that it was after a decades of oppression of Ukrainians by Poles, and the Poles themselves retaliated by the very same civilian massacres, though in a lesser scale, AFAIK. It's a tough topic that both countries should discuss and educate their people about, but instead Poland constantly shames Ukraine while being defensive about their own deeds and Ukrainians are simply turning a blind eye to the crimes of their heroes, it's literally a dead end dialogue. That's why all the meaning is now turned to this anti-Russia side of things.\n\nConversely, that's why Russians consider them \"Nazi\" symbols. Earlier described partisan struggle was just a guerilla continuation of their Great Patriotic War. After the Nazis were gone, in the 50s the Banderovtsy took their place as this terrible bloodthirsty enemy that propaganda has focused on for a while. And that's how THEY remember it and that's what they told THEIR children growing up, that's including a lot of Eastern Ukrainians btw. I know some people from Eastern Ukraine that have heard these mythic horror story from their parents, who in turn have heard them from their parents and so on. Of course, in 2014 seeing these symbols arise again on the Maidan it made really easy for some Eastern Ukrainians to believe Russian propaganda about Nazis and such. \n\nWell that was exhausting to write. Last thing I wanted to say is I wish Ukraine found and used some other personalities as their heroes, ones who are not controversial, ones who would not make people easily susceptible to Russian propaganda. But it is what it is, no country is without its controversies in their history books, I guess.",

            "body": "There are two reasons. The first is 9/11. As a Security and strategy problem 9/11 was terrifying. Plane hijacking was a thing since the 1970s, but had two important differences. First at that time it was done predominantly by a known \u2018bad actor,\u2019 pro-Palestinian organizations. The US had influence on that process, did work to try to resolve the issue in way that benefited both Israeli and Arabs, and so on. The 9/11 hijacker\u2019s were Saudis operating out of Afghanistan and the US, who were upset about nebulous things, semi-religious and semi-political. And they used way deadlier methods. Most hijackings in the 1970s weren\u2019t deadly, and while there were some spectacular attacks and tragic deaths by and large people returned home and killings were targeted. Not so with 9/11, which was seen as hard to stop and highly fatal. \n\nBound up in this was Afghanistan as a remote and unsecured space. How do you police Afghanistan? In 1901 Afghanistan was about as lawless as it was in 2001, the difference was in 1901 technology was such that teams of bad actors trained there struggled to make an impact on British Kabul, let alone export violence to NYC. 9/11 showed that I governed or unfriendly territory could be used as a base for attacks on the scale of Pearl Harbor, which is the top of the American threat threshold. So what do you do about Afghanistan? How do you deal with the potential for that country to export violence globally? \n\nNow work in Saddam. Part of Iraq was badly governed, especially in the north. And the part that was governed well was governed against the US. Saddam had, and maintained, in country connections with the same kind of Arab extremists that had caused 9/11. And Saddam *had* WMDs, particularly chemical weapons. That\u2019s not in question Saddam got them during the Iran-Iraq war and used them against the Kurds in 92. Saddam spent most of the 90s dragging his feet on disarming his WMD stock. Why? Because with the guts ripped out of his army after 91 he was incredibly vulnerable to vengeful Iranians, chemical weapons were his only safeguard. Basically using Scuds to hold Tehran hostage.

But Bush and Co. saw it as a military problem, and so I posed a military solution in Iraq and Afghanistan.",
            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>There are two reasons. The first is 9/11. As a Security and strategy problem 9/11 was terrifying. Plane hijacking was a thing since the 1970s, but had two important differences. First at that time it was done predominantly by a known \u2018bad actor,\u2019 pro-Palestinian organizations. The US had influence on that process, did work to try to resolve the issue in way that benefited both Israeli and Arabs, and so on. The 9/11 hijacker\u2019s were Saudis operating out of Afghanistan and the US, who were upset about nebulous things, semi-religious and semi-political. And they used way deadlier methods. Most hijackings in the 1970s weren\u2019t deadly, and while there were some spectacular attacks and tragic deaths by and large people returned home and killings were targeted. Not so with 9/11, which was seen as hard to stop and highly fatal. </p>\n\n<p>Bound up in this was Afghanistan as a remote and unsecured space. How do you police Afghanistan? In 1901 Afghanistan was about as lawless as it was in 2001, the difference was in 1901 technology was such that teams of bad actors trained there struggled to make an impact on British Kabul, let alone export violence to NYC. 9/11 showed that I governed or unfriendly territory could be used as a base for attacks on the scale of Pearl Harbor, which is the top of the American threat threshold. So what do you do about Afghanistan? How do you deal with the potential for that country to export violence globally? </p>\n\n<p>Now work in Saddam. Part of Iraq was badly governed, especially in the north. And the part that was governed well was governed against the US. Saddam had, and maintained, in country connections with the same kind of Arab extremists that had caused 9/11. And Saddam <em>had</em> WMDs, particularly chemical weapons. That\u2019s not in question Saddam got them during the Iran-Iraq war and used them against the Kurds in 92. Saddam spent most of the 90s dragging his feet on disarming his WMD stock. Why? Because with the guts ripped out of his army after 91 he was incredibly vulnerable to vengeful Iranians, chemical weapons were his only safeguard. Basically using Scuds to hold Tehran hostage. But Saddam figured he could play a double game, disarm (to prevent a second invasion) while sending signals he might have, or could rapidly get, weapons to use to secure his borders. It was a strategic calculation that the west would behave rationally while Iran would be deterred by his irrationality. </p>\n\n<p>Second problem with WMDs was the shambolic nature of his whole setup.

They did\n\nMany lines of evidence disprove this.\n\nFirst, British memos from the time make it clear that the British were aware the Americans not only had no evidence, but were fundamentally uninterested in evidence. In [an internal memo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downing_Street_memo) that was later leaked, the British summed up the American attitude in late 2002, months before the war: \"Bush wanted to remove Saddam Hussein, through military action, justified by the conjunction of terrorism and WMD. But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy.\"\n\nThe intelligence agencies were unable to find any credible evidence of WMD. Cheney specifically circumvented the intelligence agencies by setting up his own in-house group that combed through raw intelligence, looking for whatever scraps they could find to sell the WMD claim to the public.\n\nIf you look at every concrete piece of \"evidence\" the Bush and Blair governments presented for WMD, it turns out that they internally knew the evidence was unreliable, or even just wrong: uranium imports from Niger that their own investigators told them never occurred, defector testimony that the intelligence agencies told them was unreliable (the defector, \"curveball,\" was known to be a compulsive liar), aluminum tubes that were unsuitable for uranium enrichment centrifuges (they were used for conventional rockets). The list goes on and on. They repeatedly took information the intelligence agencies told them was unreliable or false, and then claimed in public that it was rock solid proof of Iraqi WMD.\n\nJust to add: If the Bush and Blair governments has actually cared about finding out the truth about WMDs, all they would have had to do was let the inspections continue. The problem for Bush was that the longer the inspections went on without finding any evidence of WMD, the more it undermined his case for war. The US didn't actually think Iraq would agree to new inspections, but when Iraq agreed, that put the Bush administration in an awkward position. It had to pretend to support the inspections, but it had already decided to go to war, regardless of what the inspectors found (as the British memos make clear).",

With what troops would the US have done so *during* the Iraq War?

Essentially, it's a slow moving issue that cannot be hurried up, but everyone in the world has anxiety and so talks in circles about it. \n\n**The issue prior to June 5th** was the possibility of a debt ceiling deal cutting significant funding for defense either because of want or as a compromise. There was also the chance of default, which would have been bad economic news, which could have led to a recession, which could have led to a world wide recession, which would have hurt budgets and caused countries supporting Ukraine to look to their domestic problems. Instead, that got solved by basically agreeing to keep spending levels at the current amount. \n\n**Between now and September 30th**, the issue is whether or not that deal will hold as the Freedom Caucus in the House has said they want to cut another $130b in spending. To express their disapproval, they are making McCarthy's life a pain by holding up symbolic party line votes over the banning of banning gas stoves and non-symbolic priorities like the $1T farm. So it appears with the debt ceiling solved, it's back to talking about budget cuts. Stalled appropriations bills could lead to either a continuing resolution, which would trigger an automatic 1% decrease in topline numbers for next year, or a government shutdown which could have economic effects. \n\nDirectly related to Ukraine, the Defense number toplines didn't include Ukraine supplemental funding, which McCarthy says he doesn't want to do again. However, there is strong support for a supplemental which is \"agreed\" to be outside the budget caps by Democratic party members in Congress, and a solid group of GOP senators. What that looks like in the House is unknown, though there has been expressed frustration by some more moderate GOP members with the Freedom Caucus' antics, and there are still quite a few GOP hawks as well. \n\n**After whenever the budget gets approved**, the next slow rolling issue to provoke anxiety will be the November 2024 election. Not only is the President up, but also the entire House and 1/3 of the Senate. Not to stray too far into the political landscape, but the House is likely to be a near dead even so control will likely be very close. Whichever party controls the House - and what those just elected Reps look like - will have a big effect on whether Ukraine aid becomes easy to do in the House or still an issue. \n\nSenate wise, the map has 3 tough seats to hold for the Democratic Party: Montana, Ohio, and West Virginia. All three have strong incumbents, but the states lean hard Republican. Democratic pickups aren't really in close reach. However, the Senate will likely be an easier pass since more GOP Senators are more supportive of Ukraine aid. \n\nNone of these issues could/will be hurried up. Congress could get their shit together and pass a budget earlier, but politically everyone is playing the hold out game to see if the other caves first. The problem is a significant portion of GOP House members don't care if everything falls apart if they don't get their way, and so the threat of economic pain isn't a motivator for them. Other than that, the election is on a schedule and won't happen early. \n\nSo there's a lot of worry about the US pulling aid, but it's likely not as probable as the constant worry makes it seem.",

Why are they having free hospitalizations when we can't support the homeless vets at home?)\n\nThe snarky answer would be \"because republicans keep cutting taxes for corporations and filthy rich folks\", of course.\n\nThe Russian economy is a big black box and they don't even release most of the numbers anymore that the world bank and IMF tend to rely on when doing this kind of analysis. Very likely the numbers they do still publicise are based on two things, jack and shit. Those orgs will however not come out and say \"Russia is cooking the books and these numbers are likely fiction\", as taking sides in anything \"political\" would have them lose so much support internationally that they wouldn't be able to do their jobs anymore.

Their force projection is on the whole rather weak, and the Chinese reunification issue ranks much lower in importance in Europe foreign policy than in the US. \n\nIn fact, I think the Chinese bombing Kadena Air Base on Okinawa would be more likely to dissuade Japanese involvement despite the fact that it's technically Japanese territory. Ballistic missile volleys on the island would very much vindicate the anti-base political coalition in Japan. \n\nLastly, US success depends on the ability they have to establish air superiority. When Kadena is put out of action, there will be only one option , their carrier force. The problem with the carrier force is that it must operate within a few hundred nautical miles of the combat area. The jets don't have unlimited range. \n\nBeing compelled to necessarily operate within a few hundred nautical miles of Taiwan makes the carriers very easy for China to locate and target with submarines and sea/land/air launched missiles.",

Their force projection is on the whole rather weak, and the Chinese reunification issue ranks much lower in importance in Europe foreign policy than in the US. </p>\n\n<p>In fact, I think the Chinese bombing Kadena Air Base on Okinawa would be more likely to dissuade Japanese involvement despite the fact that it&#39;s technically Japanese territory. Ballistic missile volleys on the island would very much vindicate the anti-base political coalition in Japan. </p>\n\n<p>Lastly, US success depends on the ability they have to establish air superiority. When Kadena is put out of action, there will be only one option , their carrier force. The problem with the carrier force is that it must operate within a few hundred nautical miles of the combat area. The jets don&#39;t have unlimited range. </p>\n\n<p>Being compelled to necessarily operate within a few hundred nautical miles of Taiwan makes the carriers very easy for China to locate and target with submarines and sea/land/air launched missiles.</p>\n</div>",

F-35s can take off from Guam carrying either of the two most recent long-range anti-ship cruise missiles, i.e. LRASM and/or Joint Strike Missiles. F-35A/C range is about equal to the distance from Guam to Taiwan, so they can be topped off a little over halfway there and then refueled on the way back. Both missile types are low-observable, can be carried in their internal weapons bays, and together they provide a standoff range of about 180-555 km depending on how they are used.\n\nNote that aircraft carriers could do the same thing from the same distance and any arbitrary direction.

The older 9K33 Osa (SA-8 Gecko) is based on an amphibious six-wheeled chassis and its missiles have a maximum range of 9.3 miles and a maximum altitude of 40,000 feet.

It can engage targets out to a range of 3.1 miles. Filling a similar role is the 2K22 Tunguska (SA-19 Grison), which combines 9M311 series surface-to-air missiles with twin 30mm cannons. Again, these systems are ideal for accompanying armor on the move, but they are not available to Ukraine in significant numbers.\n\n...\n\nUkraine will no doubt develop new tactics to help counter an increasingly assertive Russian military aviation presence amid the ongoing counter-offensive.
