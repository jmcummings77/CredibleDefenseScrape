These are the same directions where there had been the two so-called \"breakthroughs\" (later contained) on the Zherebets in the second half of July - back then there had been a great participation by elements of the 4th Tank Division of the 1st GTA, along with these two brigades. \n\nAs I had read earlier, a Russian tank battalion would be involved in the actions, supporting the motorized infantry, despite the area being hilly and forested. Ukrainians report 6 Russian tanks destroyed in this area today. Ukraine Weapons Tracker [posted this image](https://nitter.net/UAWeapons/status/1697642444538384548) a little while ago, I wouldn't be surprised that this is indeed the area in question. \n\nThis for the Ukrainians was the \"junction area\", until late July, between the 66th Mech Brigade and the new 32nd Mech Brigade. Ukraine has then sent reinforcements to increase force density in the area: now the brigades employed in the fighting are the 68th Jager Brigade (transferred from Velyka Novosilka), the newly formed 43rd Mech Brigade (it's the first \"tour of duty\" for this brigade, it arrived there during mid August - DeepState reports that it's fighting well) and probably a battalion of paratroopers from the 25th Airborne Brigade.\n\nIn any case, the return to the offensive by the Russians in the area has occurred over the past week. It's now the hottest area between Kupyansk and Kreminna. As of now, no breakthrough is reported. But let's remember that a look at what's going on there should always be taken though, because if the Russians ever reach the watershed between the Oskil and Zherebets (6 km from where the fighting is going on), it could be a problem for the entire northeastern front. Their goal is to reach the line between Pershotravneve and Cherneshchyna, and from there they would be in a very good topographical position to target Borova in a potential second attack. At that point, moreover, the Ukrainians' \"operational rear\" would also be a bit too short, with the Oskil River behind them.\n\nThe Kupyansk sector is stable - in fact, the Ukrainians would have counterattacked and recovered territory in the forest south of Lyman Pershyi. At the same time, the regiments of the 47th Tank Division of the 1st GTA would be being deployed around Yahidne, potentially to support the actions of the 2nd Motorized Division in that area. \n\nIn total, the Western Military District (deployed between Kupyansk and Svatove, except for the 144th Motorized Division which is in Kreminna) can count, according to reports of the Ukrainian military intelligence, on 51 thousand personnel, 495 tanks, 441 AFVs, 403 artillery guns of \u2265100mm caliber, 128 MLRS. To this we have to add the (smaller) Central Military District, which is active between Svatove and the Serebrianka Forest in Kreminna. The VDV since June has gone from having five active regiments in the Kreminna sector to only one due to redeployments in Bakhmut and lately in the Orikhiv sector. This could mean less pressure in Kreminna and the possibility of lateral redeployments for the Ukrainians, which in case of need in Svatove and Kupyansk might no longer need to bring their strategic reserves or brigades from e.g. the South. For instance, there may be indications that the 21st Mech Brigade (or at least elements) were sent to the Kupyansk sector from Kreminna. The Russians in the coming weeks will most likely try to keep pressing in these sectors to try to divert as many Ukrainian resources as possible. \n\nTo conclude, in the northeastern front for the past 2 months the situation has pretty much been almost the same: nothing too worrisome, for the moment, but it's always better not to underestimate potential dangers.",

Note, the study is an english-language PDF requiring download. \n\nIAR claim to have used satellite imagery from April to September 2021 to meticulously count pre-war Russian tank stockpiles across the country, of which they counted a total of 5,363 with the following model breakdown: \n\n* 1009 undetermined, 624 T-80s, 2055 T-72s, 1512 T-62s, 466 T-54/55s\n\nThey estimated that up to 40% more were in storage hangars for a total of between 6,000 and 7,000 total tanks in storage (they think closer to 6,000 is more likely). Additionally, IAR estimated that Russia had approximately 3,078 tanks on active duty in 2021 for a total of approximately 9-10k total Russian tanks.\n\nAs of August 27, 2023 Russia had lost 2,268 tanks according to Oryx. Assuming Oryx is the absolute floor for losses, if another 30% of losses haven't been visually confirmed, that means Russia had lost about 3k tanks as of the end of August, nearly their entire active fleet pre-war. \n\nBased on estimated losses, and the number of Russian tanks in storage that won't be able to be returned to service (they think as many as half of Russian tanks in storage are irreparable), they think Russia still has about 3,100 tanks operational and another 3000 available in storage (note: some of their total numbers don't quite add up, might be issues with translation).\n\nAdditionally, IAR estimate that Russian repair plants can only upgrade/manufacture/restore about 400 tanks per year based on labor shortages and sanctions-related equipment shortages. \n\nIn summary, IAR thinks Russian efforts at modernization/refurbishment are well below whats needed to keep up with losses and that maintenance of active tanks will continue to get harder as the Russian stockpiles shrink over the coming year. They note that there's a lot of uncertainty over how many Russian tanks in storage are actually servicable, especially since many are being cannibalized for parts. The quality of tanks available to Russia continues to deteriorate and there's little evidence this will change over time. \n\n>Continued degradation under Ukrainian military pressure has the potential to bring Russian ground forces to breaking point. The current low availability of tanks prohibits any serious offensive against the Ukrainian army, thus explaining the largely defensive posture of the current Russian system.\n\n>Without an exact knowledge of the vehicle readiness rate, it is difficult to reliably project the breaking point of Russian armor strength. Nevertheless, this force very likely entered a zone of tension, preventing any serious initiative on the part of this force. What remains certain is that a continued effort of attrition, destruction of field logistics and artillery reduction by Ukrainian forces will bring Russian forces closer to breaking point.\n\n>This pressure must remain continuous in order to prevent any reconstitution of a park of tanks which could be able to carry out an offensive. While the level of technology will most likely not match that of the initial invading forces, the mace can pose a threat if it catches the Ukrainian Armed Forces off guard.",

The NRF has switched to more dispersed attacks across the north of the country and Kabul and as a result, has been able to carry out more attacks on Taliban forces seemingly with the goal of gradually expanding attacks to the entire north of the country, however as a result so far the attacks have been weaker and somewhat disappointing with many only killing or injuring a few Taliban and none causing any serious damage to Taliban forces in any province. Overall though this is a positive development for anti-Taliban forces who (falsely) appeared to have been effectively suppressed in the spring. In response, the Taliban have increased mass arrests in Takhar, Baghlan, Kabul, and Panjshir Provinces mostly targeting people from Panjshir or those involved with the former Afghan security forces. They have also carried out large-scale anti-guerrilla sweeps in Baghlan and Badakshan but with limited success.\n\nSources for the claims were the media pages of both groups as I unfortunately do not have the time to go back and find more accurate casualty reports from other sources, NRF numbers may be slightly too high or too low but AFF reports are usually extremely accurate so if anything I would expect that their numbers are an undercount. \n\nSources: \n\n[https://twitter.com/AfgFreedomAFF](https://twitter.com/AfgFreedomAFF)\n\n[https://twitter.com/NRFafg](https://twitter.com/NRFafg)",

I worked closely with all the people involved in the different sections and really, even though I hate steam engines, heritage units and the like, loved learning how all the nuts and bolts worked on the Railroad.  (I really, really, really recommend Rocky Mountain Railroaders to anyone, great documentary series - Although seeing faces to names was interesting).\n\nI want to say with that video it was actually a day or two to get the line back open, but the concept is the same. (In NA, there's heavy equipment contractors and all of this stuff on standby, ready to go. Like the ready use track sections they use, etc)\n\nYeah, okay. NA railroads are different, but the principles are still the same. \n\nI feel a lot of people watch that old WW2 training film, and think it's like that. Sure, like, India railways might be like that (Their operating ratio is like 97% compared to 60% in NA, and they have people who literally walk the tracks to inspect them), however it isn't the case.\n\nIn reality track maintenance is crazy heavily automated / mechanized. Between gangs able to replace 25 ft rail sections in an hour (smallest unit really 6-8 personnel on a hi-rail truck complete with train). Replacement track is easy, since the ground is surveyed / prepared, new track takes a lot longer.\n\nTo the entire work train system.  Or Tie gangs (which are 20-30 people all on equipment to replace thousand of feet of railroad ties per day). They also work crazy fast as well. There is also an a geometry train, which is neat, I think there's maybe a half dozen in North America.\n\nAs was said before here, I think a year ago. The Russians have huge amounts of railroad troops, with equipment. So blowing a few track sections is easy to work around. That's just in the areas they would operate in.\n\nUltimately, any railroad attack would be better off taking out sidings, and rail yards. Rail yards especially to cause chaos. Bombing yards (Anywhere on the network, Volgograd, Perm, St. Petersburg, anywhere will cause more delays) with drones, will give more pound per pound, as at that point, your not setting-off cars, nor building new trains.  Bombing sidings means you can't stack traffic, causing a slow down further behind (Re-enforces my last paragraph about delays. Rail traffic controllers would lose their job, and have if they caused that sort of incident).\n\nHaving sat on the frontlines, at least in NA, the railroad is far from automated, and there is fights at every turn against it.  The next big technology coming out is completely automated, AI assisted train inspection stations.\n\nIt's also a system that isn't like a road, it is planned, so disruptions can be worked around a lot more.  The culture where I worked was that delays were unacceptable. If, for example, there was an IT Outage that would delay a train, it would be noted, and everyone up to and including the CIO would be on the call (Sometimes to the determent of things).\n\nOne of our department metrics was how many hours of delays per year caused by IT. Hours. Consider, 10 trains delayed for 1 hour was 10 hours of delays.  I think we were allowed, and again, it's been a few years, 120 hours of delays a year. However I forget the exact thing.",

I worked closely with all the people involved in the different sections and really, even though I hate steam engines, heritage units and the like, loved learning how all the nuts and bolts worked on the Railroad.  (I really, really, really recommend Rocky Mountain Railroaders to anyone, great documentary series - Although seeing faces to names was interesting).</p>\n\n<p>I want to say with that video it was actually a day or two to get the line back open, but the concept is the same. (In NA, there&#39;s heavy equipment contractors and all of this stuff on standby, ready to go. Like the ready use track sections they use, etc)</p>\n\n<p>Yeah, okay. NA railroads are different, but the principles are still the same. </p>\n\n<p>I feel a lot of people watch that old WW2 training film, and think it&#39;s like that. Sure, like, India railways might be like that (Their operating ratio is like 97% compared to 60% in NA, and they have people who literally walk the tracks to inspect them), however it isn&#39;t the case.</p>\n\n<p>In reality track maintenance is crazy heavily automated / mechanized. Between gangs able to replace 25 ft rail sections in an hour (smallest unit really 6-8 personnel on a hi-rail truck complete with train). Replacement track is easy, since the ground is surveyed / prepared, new track takes a lot longer.</p>\n\n<p>To the entire work train system.  Or Tie gangs (which are 20-30 people all on equipment to replace thousand of feet of railroad ties per day). They also work crazy fast as well. There is also an a geometry train, which is neat, I think there&#39;s maybe a half dozen in North America.</p>\n\n<p>As was said before here, I think a year ago. The Russians have huge amounts of railroad troops, with equipment. So blowing a few track sections is easy to work around. That&#39;s just in the areas they would operate in.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, any railroad attack would be better off taking out sidings, and rail yards. Rail yards especially to cause chaos. Bombing yards (Anywhere on the network, Volgograd, Perm, St. Petersburg, anywhere will cause more delays) with drones, will give more pound per pound, as at that point, your not setting-off cars, nor building new trains.  Bombing sidings means you can&#39;t stack traffic, causing a slow down further behind (Re-enforces my last paragraph about delays. Rail traffic controllers would lose their job, and have if they caused that sort of incident).</p>\n\n<p>Having sat on the frontlines, at least in NA, the railroad is far from automated, and there is fights at every turn against it.  The next big technology coming out is completely automated, AI assisted train inspection stations.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s also a system that isn&#39;t like a road, it is planned, so disruptions can be worked around a lot more.  The culture where I worked was that delays were unacceptable. If, for example, there was an IT Outage that would delay a train, it would be noted, and everyone up to and including the CIO would be on the call (Sometimes to the determent of things).</p>\n\n<p>One of our department metrics was how many hours of delays per year caused by IT. Hours. Consider, 10 trains delayed for 1 hour was 10 hours of delays.  I think we were allowed, and again, it&#39;s been a few years, 120 hours of delays a year. However I forget the exact thing.</p>\n</div>",

Aznar **literally retired** from politics before the election to enable Rajoy to take over. In essence, You were trying to ascribe Spain's motivation for withdrawal as carried out by PSOE government - who, before the invasion even took place, were a staunch opponent of the said invasion and completely in line with up to 90% of the Spanish population - as being influenced by the 11M attacks. It was not, in any way, shape or form. Yes, these were politically motivated attacks (hence the definition of terrorism) and their timing does indeed further prove it, but in no way could al-Qaeda predict that Aznar (he was considered the puppet master of Rajoy back in the day) would go full Franco (blaming it all exclusively on ETA with many of his speeches absolutely echoing Franco's speeches of the past, remember he did come from a \"post\"-Francist party) in his rhetoric during the remaining few days before the elections. If they reacted as anyone normal would, they would've had a real chance at winning the elections once more - but even then, Aznar literally retired to allow Rajoy to potentially (despite his remarks throughout 2003, he was after all a hand-picked heir apparent) leave Iraq and simply blame it solely on his predecessor, which was already the view of the vast majority of the Spanish people - that the whole ordeal was pushed through simply by one individual who furthermore caused such a fractioning in his own party that Spain has not since seen such a slew of ruling party's national and regional leaders resigning. Every major party back then was trying to get the election to revolve around the Iraq invasion in their own respective way - PSOE was lambasting its unpopularity, PP was banking on ignoring the Iraq issue to \"deflate\" PSOE, likely with the idea of pulling out \"silently\" relatively soon after the election and pivot to their new self-conjured idea of being the pre-eminent leader of South American countries as well as being relatively independent of the rest of the EU/NATO in terms of foreign policies. In other words, both potential governments were pretty set on leaving Iraq - and if they weren't, either one of them would, as per their best polling results, merely be able to reach a plurality in both chambers, ie. a coalition with smaller, usually regionalists parties, would be an absolute requirement to reach the majority/power and most of those party did consider the Iraq withdrawal as a cornerstone of their respective (national) manifestos. In other words, just about every relevant political factor in Spain before the election (and 11M bombings) was either outright for pulling out almost immediately or sought to do it likely just a bit slower to control the fallout and then pivot to a whole new brand of Foreign Policy so as to bury their own participation in the whole ordeal.",
