Akin to the sinking of the Moskva, this is mostly a propaganda and a morale victory showing that Russian military installations in Crimea are not safe from Ukrainian attacks. The Russians have blamed the explosions at the airbase on accidents and incompetence and the later explosions on sabotage. Regardless, we still get the implication that Russia is too incompetent to protect Crimea. \n\nAs for the other factors. The 9 aircraft damaged or destroyed (number depends on reports) will likely be hard to replace if bot near impossible due to the scarcity of certain electronic components. However, if a couple of aircraft aren\u2019t total losses, Russia can theoretically cannibalize parts from another aircraft or more likely, use it as a source of spare parts. There are also the loss of trained pilots and technicians to consider as it requires a significant investment in time to train these kinds of personnel. After all, their jobs are a bit more complicated than the average infantryman. However, that really isn\u2019t the crux of the issue. Rather, it is the movement of the aircraft out of Crimea. It should be obvious that aircraft have a limited amount of fuel. If the distance between your base of operations and the target increases, the distance that needs to be covered obviously increases as well. This increases the amount of fuel depleted per sortie and the amount of time spent getting to the destination and out. As such, the amount and frequency of air strikes will decrease depending on how far this new air base is. In addition, there will be an increased burden on the supply chain for obvious reasons. Of course it is certainly not a game changing event that revises the whole battlefield but it will give Ukraine a bit more breathing room.  \n\nKherson is where this becomes relevant as Crimea forms an integral part of the Russian defense as a logistics hub. If Ukraine is able to force the Russians into relocating their logistical hubs and assets such as artillery and aircraft farther back, this leads to a decrease in Russia\u2019s ability to support troops west of the bridgehead at Kherson Oblast.\n\nWhile I don\u2019t expect the infantry to exit Crimea any time soon, I do expect command related assets to be relocated elsewhere akin to the current situation at Kherson. \n\nIn short, the relocation of aircraft from Crimea to somewhere else will increase the amount of fuel required per sortie and decrease the frequency of air strikes due to the increased distance. In addition, by forcing logistical and certain combat assets like artillery and aircraft to relocate to more secure areas, Russia is less able to support troops operating west of the Dnipro River in Kherson Oblast.

                        "body": "> Wiping out the dam would probably wipe out a lot of Russian forces in the area. But would also wipe out a lot of citizens.\n\nI used to think this, and in fact have said as much on this forum within the past few weeks, but I had a very random conversation with a friend who works in civil engineering at a hydroelectric dam the other day and he pointed out that the Kakhovka hydro dam is a [\"run-of-the-river\" dam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-of-the-river_hydroelectricity). Which means it doesn't create an upstream reservoir, like what you see in pictures of the Hoover dam. \n\nMight be worth noting that the Kakhovka reservoir was created when they built this particular dam, but it is not the hydro dam's structure itself (i.e. the spillway, the 500m concrete structure spanning the river) that creates the reservoir. It's the earthen embankments on either side of the spillway that actually dam the river's flow. So destroying the spillway isn't likely to cause significant flooding beyond potentially some hard-to-predict localized effects. Certainly nothing as dramatic as the ending of Force 10 from Navarone, if that's sort of what you're picturing when you think of this scenario. \n\nThat's all with the caveat that this information is incredibly second-hand and unreliable, as it was an offhand comment from someone who is definitely not an expert on blowing up dams and knows almost nothing about the Kakhovka dam beyond what you can find on Wikipedia. \n\n[However, even if there isn't flooding risk, it's also entirely possible that the dam is effectively indestructible for all practical purposes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dnieper_reservoir_cascade).\n\n> For instance, some engineers guarantee that every Dnieper dam will survive an earthquake (to its typical regional extent), meteorite or aircraft falling. [...]\n\n> In 2012, the former Kyiv Hydroelectric Power Plant manager and veteran stated that the dam is guaranteed to be capable of withstanding any physical threat except for a large space object impact or **a deliberate military attack of significant scale.** \n\n[If you look at the dam from above](https://www.google.com/maps/@46.776628,33.3725782,3060m/data=!3m1!1e3), that much is believable. The majority of the river's span is crossed by the solid earthen embankments, which are definitely not going to be easily destroyed, especially at range. The rest is crossed by a solid concrete structure on top of 30 meter tall, solid concrete pylons spaced 20 meters apart.\n\nSo theoretically it's possible to destroy the spillway, but it probably can't even be seriously damaged without expending enormous amounts of munitions. You'd also need to take out multiple contiguous pylons to make it worthwhile, because otherwise the Russians could lay replacement spans quite easily. Meaning you'd have to do a hard thing that takes a large amount of very precisely delivered explosives, and then you'd have to do it multiple times for it to be really effective. It doesn't help that even if the whole structure were to collapse, the wreckage would probably still make reasonably solid ground for an assault bridge. \n\nSo the Ukrainians are blowing up the little access bridge instead. Requires about the same effort to fix as if they had knocked out a single span of the spillway, but can be destroyed with a substantially smaller warhead. And, of course, at the end of all of this the Ukrainians want to own a working hydro dam, not a pile of concrete rubble.",

According to, well uh [this website](https://erdgasspeicher.de/erdgasspeicher/gasspeicherkapazitaeten/) German gas storage capacity is about 230 TWh. According to the same website, Germany plans (and is on track to) fill 95% of its storage capacity by November 1. It\u2018s not clear exactly how far down gas storage levels will be allowed to descend by the end of the winter - typically it stays at 30 or 40%, lets assume the floor is about 20% as this is an extraordinary situation. This means that 75% of the volume of total gas storage capacity in the country, or about 170 TWh, will be released from storage during the winter period - meaning that the remaining 430 TWh will have to be covered by imports during that time period. \n\nNow this is where it gets tricky, it\u2019s hard to estimate how much gas Germany will be able to import during that period. The few statistics that are publicly and easily accessible probably don\u2019t come close to reflecting the actual situation on the ground. As a ballpark number, the latest [report](https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/DE/Fachthemen/ElektrizitaetundGas/Versorgungssicherheit/aktuelle_gasversorgung/_downloads/08_August/220817_gaslage.pdf) from the Bundesnetzagentur suggests Germany has been importing around 3.5 TWh of gas per day since mid-June. According to the same document, of that about 0.5 TWh a day come from Russia. There are about 150 days between Nov 1 and Apr 1, so to fulfil its 430 TWh need for that whole period, Germany needs about 2.87 TWh a day of supply. \n\nSo in conclusion, if Germany reaches its 95% storage fulfilment target for Nov 1, it can cover all its gas needs for the next Winter without Russian gas at current import volume levels but with not much margin at all, and having to dig deep into its storage, leaving it vulnerable for the following Winter - then again, new supply routes and reduced consumption could improve the situation.",

They (and the press coverage) have focused on Kherson because the Dnieper makes it harder for the Russians to supply artillery close to the front, which in turn makes them rely on their limited, expensive air support capabilities for disrupting Ukrainian troop concentrations. So interdicting supplies over the river gets the Ukrainians half the way toward countering the two most potent remaining Russian defensive resources.\n\nMeaning, the Ukrainians will be well-positioned to start a counteroffensive on the ground in Kherson if they can continue to disrupt artillery supplies over the Dnieper and if they can find a way to beat Russian CAS, either through a direct tactical counter like NASAMs, or simply by attrition and rear area attacks on air bases like the recent example in Crimea. Given how poorly supplied the rest of the Russian military is, especially with advanced technologies such as those required for most air combat operations, and given how expensive air combat operations are just in general, I don't expect that they will be able to sustain air support at sufficient intensity to compensate for the loss of artillery. \n\nI also think the target won't necessarily be the city. I think Northern Kherson Oblast is actually more important strategically because it ensures control over Nova Kakhovka and thus the North Crimea Canal. Also, taking the hinterlands around the city will make it even easier for the Ukrainians to interdict the Russians in the city, because they will control much more of the river bank (and thus locations for pontoon bridges or ferries), and will be better positioned to shell the river crossings nearer to the city. And they will be much more motivated to starve the Russians out of the city than they are in the rural areas, because they want to avoid destroying urban areas with house-to-house fighting. \n\nBut either way, the Ukrainians will prioritize whichever axis is more vulnerable because both the city and rural areas are legitimate and important strategic objectives, it's just a matter of how much it costs to take them and how well any counteroffensive enables subsequent follow-on offensives (so, e.g., taking Melitopol might put the Ukrainians in a better position to retake the land bridge and then Crimea compared to taking Kherson, but it might cost orders of magnitude more in terms of lives and material to take). \n\nUltimately the Ukrainians are playing a much more conservative game than the Russians. They don't want to level their own villages and cities with artillery before throwing light infantry into a meat grinder just to say they advanced a few hundred meters. So they are biding their time, focusing on degrading Russian deep strike capabilities and logistics before trying to retake heavily defended territory. The only alternative explanation for the lack of progress on the ground is that they do not have sufficient offensive-capable units in reserve because they are throwing everything at the front just to stay in the fight. Which is possible, but I would only conclude that is certainly the case if the Ukrainians failed to make progress even after degrading Russian artillery and air support.

Nobody should be sleeping comfortably until this conflict is resolved. Lord knows it keeps me up at night and I am an outside observer. I do find it incredibly contradictory, however, that he is willing to state that the US is unlikely to engage in nuclear retaliation regarding Ukraine but would somehow be willing to deploy troops there? I think he labors a bit too much over the idea of the US entering the war, based on everything we have available the US is doing everything it can to avoid that exact outcome and that has been a central point of US policy from even before the actual invasion. He also subtly blames Ukraine for damage done to Zaporizhia, which is weird but perhaps not unexpected. One thing I do find marginally annoying is his conclusion that the US should have ended the conflict through negotiation before it even started. Yet just within the last few days a detailed WaPo article was published showing that the US and Europe were essentially hurling off-ramps at Putin and Russia was just ignoring them one after another in favor of a monomaniacal adherence to the conquest of Ukraine. This is a good illustration of Mearsheimer continuing to labor under the delusion that this whole thing was really about Russian security concerns, not Russian neo-imperial ambitions, despite the obvious facts and rhetoric pointing to the latter. I can understand how, as one of the standard bearers of the more radical forms of neorealism, Mearsheimer might ascribe to the idea that even a neo-imperial war of conquest was ultimately rooted in security concerns, but I think he is too keen to portray Russia as a victim without options, rather than an actor with options who chose the most destructive one. At the end of the day, I fail to see who this piece is for. It's not treading any new ground, escalation concerns have been part of the narrative of this conflict since almost day one. Nobody in serious positions of power seems to be ignoring the perils of escalation either. And though Mearsheimer does provide concise explanations of hypothetical escalatory scenarios, none of them are new explanations (except for perhaps his rabid fascination with the US entering the war for some reason). So what was the point?",

This can be seen in the rapid rise of military Telegram channels offering a critical view of the country\u2019s political and military elite and whether it lives up to its claim of great power status.

The Type 26 frigates that will replace them(along with the Iroquois-class destroyers, which were decommissioned a few years ago) are solid little ships, but construction hasn&#39;t even started. The relatively poorly equipped Halifax-class frigates will be around 40 years old by the time they&#39;re replaced. The retirement of the Iroquois-class destroyers with no immediate replacement has left the Canadian Navy with no medium/long range AD until the Type 26 frigates are procured. </p>\n\n<p>Canada has spent over a decade trying to replace their CF-18, which are based on the original F/A-18A/B Hornet. As of March this year the on and off again deal for the F-35A still isn&#39;t finalized. In the mean time it has left the RCAF will obsolete aircraft in poor material shape, and forced them to upgrade airframes that have too many hours, along with purchasing retired 18 retired Australian F/A-18A/Bs to cannibalize for spare parts. </p>\n\n<p>Canadian procurement is a bit of a mess.</p>\n</div>",

Are we really watching the same war.</p>\n\n<p>sign, you&#39;re willing to say any kind of contradictory nonsense to keep the argument going, after your post has been completely dismantled.</p>\n</div>",
