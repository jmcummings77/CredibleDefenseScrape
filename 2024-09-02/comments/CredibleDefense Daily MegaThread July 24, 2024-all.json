        "body": ">Sometimes oft repeated numbers need revisiting. One example is Russian artillery fire rates. These have generally been overestimated going back to 2022, along with ammo consumption rates, with sensational 60k per day figures. A short thread. 1/\n\n>First, what are we counting? The numbers given out are typically for main caliber artillery types: 152mm, 122mm, MLRS (300, 220, 122), and 120mm mortars. This figure is not inclusive of smaller infantry mortars, anti-tank guns, tanks used indirect fire roles, etc. 2/\n\n>Russian fire rates for 2022 were probably in the 15,000-20,000 range. Likely \\~18,000 (see forthcoming podcast discussion on this). There\u2019s little evidence that Russian fires reached 60,000 per day in 2022. The peaks were likely double the figure above, at 35,000-40,000. 3/\n\n>This brings the annualized fire rate closer to 5.5-6M in 2022. That does not include ammunition supplies destroyed in strikes, and it is difficult to account for what that might add up to. A conservative guess is another 500K-1M. 4/\n\n>Where did the 60k figure come from? At a certain point in Spring 2022 Ukraine was firing on average 5-6K per day. Russia had a localized 10:1 fires advantage in select areas. I suspect this was multiplied out to generate the 60k figure, but this was never representative. 5/\n\n>The Russian fire rate declined from probably 15k in winter of 2023, to less than 10k by the summer, and increased back again in October due to an influx of North Korean ammo.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>Sometimes oft repeated numbers need revisiting. One example is Russian artillery fire rates. These have generally been overestimated going back to 2022, along with ammo consumption rates, with sensational 60k per day figures. A short thread. 1/</p>\n\n<p>First, what are we counting? The numbers given out are typically for main caliber artillery types: 152mm, 122mm, MLRS (300, 220, 122), and 120mm mortars. This figure is not inclusive of smaller infantry mortars, anti-tank guns, tanks used indirect fire roles, etc. 2/</p>\n\n<p>Russian fire rates for 2022 were probably in the 15,000-20,000 range. Likely ~18,000 (see forthcoming podcast discussion on this). There\u2019s little evidence that Russian fires reached 60,000 per day in 2022. The peaks were likely double the figure above, at 35,000-40,000. 3/</p>\n\n<p>This brings the annualized fire rate closer to 5.5-6M in 2022. That does not include ammunition supplies destroyed in strikes, and it is difficult to account for what that might add up to. A conservative guess is another 500K-1M. 4/</p>\n\n<p>Where did the 60k figure come from? At a certain point in Spring 2022 Ukraine was firing on average 5-6K per day. Russia had a localized 10:1 fires advantage in select areas. I suspect this was multiplied out to generate the 60k figure, but this was never representative. 5/</p>\n\n<p>The Russian fire rate declined from probably 15k in winter of 2023, to less than 10k by the summer, and increased back again in October due to an influx of North Korean ammo. Ukraine had fires parity, and at times a slight advantage in the south during summer of 2023. 6/</p>\n\n<p>By summer 2023 Russian forces increasingly used Lancets in counterbattery roles, had access to large quantities of FPVs, and increased numbers of PGMs, with reduced emphasis on a volume of fire approach for certain missions. 7/</p>\n\n<p>The Russian average for 2023 is probably closer to 10k daily expenditure, and Russian fires have held steady at that figure so far in 2024.

        "body": "An article about the pervasive threat of Russia's surveillance drones.  The UAF is going to continue to struggle if they are losing the battle for having eyes in the sky.  Not only are the frontline troops dealing with the ever growing glide bomb problem but it's also going to grow ever more dangerous to train or move or store anything anywhere near the front.  \n\n[Ukraine Military Boss: Russian Drones Flying Untargeted Due to \u2018Total Shortage\u2019 of MANPADS | Kyiv Post | July 2024](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/36257) \n\n*Russian observation drones are operating freely over the battlefield and can call in artillery, air and missile strikes without interference because the Ukrainian Ground Forces have little to shoot them with, Oleksandr Syrsky, commander of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU), said in a statement.*\n\n*Lt. Gen. Syrsky in comments published on Monday on his personal Telegram channel said that Ukrainian forces are facing a \u201ctotal shortage\u201d of hand-held anti-aircraft missiles and must find \u201cnew ways\u201d to attack the Russian reconnaissance aircraft armed with advanced sensors and muti-spectral cameras. He suggested troops under his command improve jamming techniques and develop tactics for using one-way kamikaze drones to intercept and ram the enemy robot planes.*\n\n*A Tuesday statement by the AFU General Staff (AGS) reported the Russian Air Force on Monday set new numerical record with 132 glider bomb strikes against Ukrainian forces, most in support of the main Russian offensive effort toward Pokrovsk.*\n\n*Russian state-run media has repeatedly claimed the Kremlin\u2019s attacks across the front will ultimately succeed, because Ukrainian forces are unable to oppose long-range Russian air and missile strikes called in by observation drones Kyiv\u2019s troops are unable to engage.*\n\n*Kyiv Post research into images and drone video published by pro-Russia information platforms in the first half of July confirmed Russian observation drones are at least at times operating deep behind Ukrainian lines at multiple locations and are find targets and observer missile strikes on them, apparently without interference.*\n\n*Camera-toting Russian drones have in the past two weeks flown as much as 50 kilometers into Ukrainian territory and recorded Russian long-range missile strikes in the Kharkiv, Donetsk, Mykolaiv, Zaporizhzhia, Odesa regions. Ukrainian troop-training bases, airfields, rail hubs, anti-aircraft systems, ammunition storage sites, and equipment warehouses were among the targets, Kyiv Post review of 15 videos published since July 10 showed.*\n\n*Starting in Spring some Ukrainian air defenders have taken to the skies themselves aboard single-engine training planes, with the passenger armed with an automatic rifle or a shotgun, to hunt down free-flying Russian drones.*\n\n*Ukrainian forces much prefer to use highly-effect hand-held, shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles to attack Russian drones, but supplies of those weapons have run short as Ukraine\u2019s main suppliers of such weaponry \u2013 the US, Poland, France and the UK \u2013 have nearly emptied existing stocks and found local manufacturers unable to gear up quickly to manufacture more weapons.*\n\n*According to US defense media, in 2023 Raytheon, the manufacturer of highly-successful-in-Ukraine Stinger anti-aircraft missile, called in retired engineers and technicians to restart production lines stopped two decades ago.*\n\n*Skyrsky\u2019s comments on the gap in anti-drone missiles \u2013 often called MANPADS (man-portable air-defense systems) in NATO vernacular, followed a two-day visit to front-line formations in the heavily pressed eastern Donbas sector, scene of repeated Russian ground assaults and massed bombardments in past weeks.*\n\n*\u201cThe enemy is ignoring rather high levels of losses and is continuing to push,\u201d Syrsky said. Russian forces currently are embarked on a broad-front offensive, he said, and are launching daily attacks against the Donbas towns and villages of Krasnohorivka, Progres, Zalizny, Stelmakhivka, Makiivka, Ivanovsky, Chasiv Yar, Ivanovsky and Klishchiivka. The Russian strategy is to use massed firepower to reach and capture its key objective, the Donbas transportation hub city of Pokrovsk, Syrsky said.*\n\n*Syrsky said Ukrainian troops would stay on the defensive and should focus on inflicting maximum losses on Russian forces and keeping friendly casualties as low as possible, rather than regaining lost ground.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>An article about the pervasive threat of Russia&#39;s surveillance drones.  The UAF is going to continue to struggle if they are losing the battle for having eyes in the sky.  Not only are the frontline troops dealing with the ever growing glide bomb problem but it&#39;s also going to grow ever more dangerous to train or move or store anything anywhere near the front.  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kyivpost.com/post/36257\">Ukraine Military Boss: Russian Drones Flying Untargeted Due to \u2018Total Shortage\u2019 of MANPADS | Kyiv Post | July 2024</a> </p>\n\n<p><em>Russian observation drones are operating freely over the battlefield and can call in artillery, air and missile strikes without interference because the Ukrainian Ground Forces have little to shoot them with, Oleksandr Syrsky, commander of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU), said in a statement.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Lt. Gen. Syrsky in comments published on Monday on his personal Telegram channel said that Ukrainian forces are facing a \u201ctotal shortage\u201d of hand-held anti-aircraft missiles and must find \u201cnew ways\u201d to attack the Russian reconnaissance aircraft armed with advanced sensors and muti-spectral cameras. He suggested troops under his command improve jamming techniques and develop tactics for using one-way kamikaze drones to intercept and ram the enemy robot planes.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>A Tuesday statement by the AFU General Staff (AGS) reported the Russian Air Force on Monday set new numerical record with 132 glider bomb strikes against Ukrainian forces, most in support of the main Russian offensive effort toward Pokrovsk.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Russian state-run media has repeatedly claimed the Kremlin\u2019s attacks across the front will ultimately succeed, because Ukrainian forces are unable to oppose long-range Russian air and missile strikes called in by observation drones Kyiv\u2019s troops are unable to engage.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Kyiv Post research into images and drone video published by pro-Russia information platforms in the first half of July confirmed Russian observation drones are at least at times operating deep behind Ukrainian lines at multiple locations and are find targets and observer missile strikes on them, apparently without interference.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Camera-toting Russian drones have in the past two weeks flown as much as 50 kilometers into Ukrainian territory and recorded Russian long-range missile strikes in the Kharkiv, Donetsk, Mykolaiv, Zaporizhzhia, Odesa regions. Ukrainian troop-training bases, airfields, rail hubs, anti-aircraft systems, ammunition storage sites, and equipment warehouses were among the targets, Kyiv Post review of 15 videos published since July 10 showed.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Starting in Spring some Ukrainian air defenders have taken to the skies themselves aboard single-engine training planes, with the passenger armed with an automatic rifle or a shotgun, to hunt down free-flying Russian drones.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Ukrainian forces much prefer to use highly-effect hand-held, shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles to attack Russian drones, but supplies of those weapons have run short as Ukraine\u2019s main suppliers of such weaponry \u2013 the US, Poland, France and the UK \u2013 have nearly emptied existing stocks and found local manufacturers unable to gear up quickly to manufacture more weapons.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>According to US defense media, in 2023 Raytheon, the manufacturer of highly-successful-in-Ukraine Stinger anti-aircraft missile, called in retired engineers and technicians to restart production lines stopped two decades ago.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Skyrsky\u2019s comments on the gap in anti-drone missiles \u2013 often called MANPADS (man-portable air-defense systems) in NATO vernacular, followed a two-day visit to front-line formations in the heavily pressed eastern Donbas sector, scene of repeated Russian ground assaults and massed bombardments in past weeks.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cThe enemy is ignoring rather high levels of losses and is continuing to push,\u201d Syrsky said. Russian forces currently are embarked on a broad-front offensive, he said, and are launching daily attacks against the Donbas towns and villages of Krasnohorivka, Progres, Zalizny, Stelmakhivka, Makiivka, Ivanovsky, Chasiv Yar, Ivanovsky and Klishchiivka. The Russian strategy is to use massed firepower to reach and capture its key objective, the Donbas transportation hub city of Pokrovsk, Syrsky said.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Syrsky said Ukrainian troops would stay on the defensive and should focus on inflicting maximum losses on Russian forces and keeping friendly casualties as low as possible, rather than regaining lost ground. Defensive tactics should incorporate fortifications, mine fields and particularly FPV kamikaze drones, one of the few weapons categories in which Ukrainian troops have a clear advantage over their Russian opponents, he said.</em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://static.kyivpost.com/storage/2024/07/23/8fe81153020c3a66e2a91950b1495cac.jpg?w=1280&amp;f=webp\">Image</a></p>\n\n<p><em>Kyiv Post screen grabs from recent video claimed by pro-Russian media to document successful Kremlin surface-to-surface missile strikes against Ukrainian forces, recorded by observation drones operating deep behind Ukrainian lines.

Doesn't make promises from their taking possession of some F-16s, which is good to hear.

                "body": "Answering to u/Velixis too - this issue was [brought to light](https://i.imgur.com/1gYLGiH.jpeg) on Monday by relatives of soldiers of the 31st Mechanized Brigade, and it was then made known to the public yesterday thanks to DeepState (as far as I know, they will write a detailed report on this later). \n\nWe don't know the amount of the troops in those areas, in my opinion it's hardly that high (let's remember that generally battalions are understrength, and certainly not the entirety of their soldiers are on the front line). Specifically, the woman in the post is looking for her uncle, a MIA serviceman from the 1st Company of the 1st Battalion of the 31st Brigade. \n\nWe can't talk about encirclement because there isn't one (Google's translation of that post is also not 100% reliable), but the problem is that now the withdrawal of the guys which are at \"zero\" in those areas is very complicated and the situation overall serious, which is due to the numerous reasons already pointed out, and above all due to the lack of orders of withdrawal and problems in terms of coordination and control among the various units. \n\nThe positions currently at risk are not only the trenches to the west of Hill 237, south of Lozuvatske (where the situation is the worst), but also others north of the Avdiivka-Pokrovsk railway in the area just above Prohres (which are in danger of having their western flank cut off due to the Russians approaching Ivanivka); as well as a couple of strong points south-east of Vovche in the northern bank of the Balka Samoilova (east of the Vovcha River, of course), with the Russians attempting to enter Vovche from Prohres. \n\nOn the Russian side there has been a regrouping recently (I will write about this in the near future); the most difficult section in the sector is this one, along the railroad (which is the main effort of the 2nd CAA); the direction of the T0504 Highway is far from easy either (the main effort of the 41st CAA). In Novoselivka Persha things are complicated as well: the soldiers of the 68th Jager Brigade are tenaciously defending every single house of the settlement as well as the forest belts to the south, but even in this area there is still no order to withdraw and, like the 47th Mech Brigade, they are being sacrificed (along with the units subordinate to them) to allow the UAF to buy time  in order to keep building fortifications in the rear. The problem now, however, is that the Russians will be able to continue their attacks from the high ground between the sources of the Bychok, of the Kazennyi Torets and of the Vovhca without having to force the latter river, indeed having their left flank covered by it... \n\nI had written about this a few weeks ago: the Pokrovsk sector is the most difficult of the entire front and the situation is critical; one only has to read the reports from the OSG \"Khortytsia\" to see that the plurality of attacks in its area of jurisdiction occur in the Pokrovsk sector. The plurality of losses all along the front for both sides happen here too. The Russians attack continuously, they have enormous losses but also constant reinforcements; the Ukrainians on the other hand, in their current force structure in the sector, are unable to offer a solid resistance, mostly as a consequence of the depletion of the brigades deployed here. A week ago relatives of the (sadly quite a few) MIAs from this area have started a [petition](https://petition.president.gov.ua/petition/230460) addressed to Zelensky. In the text is the list of the brigades engaged between Novooleksandrivka and Novoselivka Persha; the list moreover excludes elements of several TDF brigades that are attached to these brigades. The 47th Mech Brigade in particular can't catch a minute of break since October (which means no time to properly rebuild it), its Abrams and Bradleys help a lot in the area and its soldiers offer a very valiant resistance, but the infantry shortage is significant - in fact they are fighting thanks to the units attached to the brigade, plus they have also recently received replenishments in terms of men from the 18th Army Aviation Brigade. \n\nThere is a very, very important need for reinforcements (as well as for serious changes in the command of the OTG \"Donetsk\") - the \"new\" 151st Mech Brigade has been committed in this area during this week, with its battalions arriving from the other sectors where they had been deployed previously; the arrival of elements of the 414th Strike UAV Regiment of the Marine Corps (\"Birds of Madyar\") might be a prelude to an arrival of maneuver units from the corps. But in any case, the Russian offensive actions in the Toretsk sector caused that numerous reinforcements had to be sent there, at the expenses of the Pokrovsk sector too.",

The logistical chain is too complex for non-state actor. The more likely option is for non-state actors to get nukes with the help of state actors. \n\nI do think more nuclear powers would increase accessibility - more nuclear powers means mor points of failure, so it would be strange to argue otherwise. But, as far as I am concerned: That's the lower risk, compared to growing instability under the current faulty non-proliferation system. \n\nBtw. I think we'd neither see less war nor would things going nuclear become more likely.

Even in 2022 when they had not taken the equipment losses and they had their prewar army they were struggling with how to supply so large a force.

Even in 2022 when they had not taken the equipment losses and they had their prewar army they were struggling with how to supply so large a force.
