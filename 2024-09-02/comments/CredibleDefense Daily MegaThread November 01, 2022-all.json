The videos of massive ammo dump explosions that once littered peoples feeds are effectively gone.\n\nIf you need any more proof of Russian adaptability look no further then Kherson.

But for Russian policy makers, this is literally the kind of Russian thinking that has gotten thousands of Russian soldiers killed. \n\nNo one is asking you, a redditor confused about UK foriegn policy, to respond to murders on UK soil. You thought it was ignored. You actually have exactly zero response if someone asked you about a Russian attack on UK infrastructure, your response is a question, right?\n\nInstead, you might ask \u2018What can the UK do?\u2019 It\u2019s hard for some to draw a line between the Skripals murders and UK foreign policy. It\u2019s completely understandable for some to not understand that the UK will react to attacks on it. That\u2019s not ok if you have 150,000 troops in a country getting hammered by western assistance. \n\nOthers in the UK are not so confused. Specifically, the vast majority of the United Kingdom along with their leaders.\n\nSo no, you aren\u2019t for example a leader in the British government, no one is looking to you to form a coherent and strong foreign policy in response, no one is then asking you how precisely you are going to execute it against a state that has made you an enemy.\n\nBut Russia has, in fact, made some very poor choices in foreign policy with regards to the UK. A lack of Russian strategic thinking can have disastrous consequences for Russians in a position to be at the mercy of United Kingdom strategic thinkers who don\u2019t have the same issues.\n\nThe below list is meritocratic strategic policy making - what happens in direct response to a Russian foreign policy that, among other things, murders civilians in the United Kingdom. The challenge for you is to hold the idea of Russian intelligence agents coming to murder people in the United Kingdom and this strategic policy response. The challenge for you is to think of how the United Kingdom might respond to an attack on UK property.\n\nHold that idea in your head and read this list until it makes sense to you. You might have to read the entire list 2-3 times, then think about Russisn foreign policy to figure out the strategic policy choices that lay behind it.

Can you point to the exact quote? [This is the best I've found so far from March 7](https://businessnc.com/retired-general-analyzes-russian-war-effort-ukrainian-hopes/) However, in the broader context, it's very clear that he's not saying that all Russian troops in Ukraine are conscripts, nor is he even saying that a majority are. He said \"a lot\" are, which, while clearly exaggerated, we weren't totally sure about in the heavy fog of war in March. \n\n>\u201cIn the Russian military, they don\u2019t have the same sort of decentralization that is part of the culture of how we fight, where lieutenants and sergeants are expected to figure what they should be doing. As long as they\u2019re moving in the general correct direction, you\u2019re expected to make decisions. You don\u2019t have to be told, OK, turn left, turn right. Stop. Go. I think the Russians have a real vulnerability here because of that.\u201d\n\n>But that ability of our units to function autonomously is the result of intense training. \u201cIt takes years to make a really good sergeant,\u201d says Hodges. \u201cIt takes years to make a really good major.\u201d\n\n>\u201cAnd it takes lots of rotations going to the Joint Readiness Training Center at Ft. Polk, La., or to our training center at Hohenfels [in Germany], where you go over and over and over and the \u2018enemy,\u2019 the OPFOR [the opposing force in an exercise], wins about 95% of the time. And it\u2019s humiliating.  I\u2019ve never actually beaten the OPFOR.\u201d\n\n>\u201cBut you learn how to do things, like protect your communications.  It\u2019s technical, but it\u2019s also the discipline and how you do things to be able to survive, because you have to assume the enemy has the ability to pick all that up,\u201d says Hodges. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what the Russians are experiencing right now. They\u2019re paying the price for indiscipline.\u201d\n\n>The Russian troops were not prepared for an intense war, Hodges believes.\n\n>\u201cWhat we\u2019ve discovered is that there are a lot of conscripts involved in this fight. So, most of these kids, 19, 20 years old, did not even know they were going into the Ukraine. You don\u2019t have to be Clausewitz to figure out the combat power or the fighting spirit of guys like that.\u201d\n\nThen, [in this article](https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/russia/956020/will-vladimir-putin-anaconda-plan-break-ukraine-resistance) a couple days later, he says the Russian units that faced the highest attrition were some of their best, including the VDV and Spetsnaz. Hyperbole is fine, but it should be rooted in some semblance of reality.\n\nEDIT: fuller quote from the first article, which makes it even more clear that he was saying the opposite of what\u2019s been suggested:\n\n>The Russian Army, despite reported improvements in recent years, seems poorly trained and didn\u2019t do an adequate job planning their ammunition and fuel requirements for the invasion, he says. Russian President Vladimir Putin may have believed there would be little resistance and his military would be greeted as liberators. Maybe his intelligence was bad or he ignored good intelligence.\n\n>The planning and training deficiencies could be seen in images of long Russian convoys, which looked impressive unless you are a retired lieutenant general. The Russians didn\u2019t seem to anticipate that this has been a very warm winter in Ukraine, and there\u2019s a lot of mud.\n\n>\u201cRight now,\u201d says Hodges, \u201cevery Ukrainian is a huge fan of global warming. And so Russian vehicles are staying on the hard road. They can\u2019t get off the hard road, and the Ukrainians know this, and so they\u2019re able to take advantage of that. It\u2019s easier to target.\u201d\n\n>But the trucks and other vehicles in the Russian convoys have also been bunched together. \u201cThis goes back to the discipline and training.  If you\u2019re a private driving a truck, and you\u2019re really scared, it is human nature to stay right on the bumper of the vehicle in front of you.\n\n>\u201cThat tells you right there not only is that private scared, but that means there\u2019s no sergeant there that\u2019s kicking him in the ass and saying, \u2018Hey, maintain a hundred meters between vehicles,\u2019 which is what you\u2019re supposed to do to avoid every vehicle in the convoy shot in one barrage.\u201d",

Essentially this is based on people and rumours within FSB/military. Some highlights by me (remember these are somewhat corrobated claims, not facts):\n\n\\- There's infighting in the military and within the FSB\n\n\\- There are partisans withni Russi, who commit acts of sabotage daily, such as attacks on recruitment offices (making it sound like Russian citizen, not Ukrainian SOF)\n\n\\- Kremlin is worried soldiers from previous wars band together in refusal to fight this war. \"There are soldiers, who don't want to bomb or kill anybody. They thus want to capture power\".\n\n\\- Putin is serisouly worried about a coup (and not from the pro-war party, as it tends to sound in this sub), which is why he made Surowikin commander, but also apparently Kadyrow and Prigoshin have orders to quell any opposition/protests against mobilisation. Kadyrow also specifically has troops in Moscow because Putin is worried about a coup any/every day. (Don't read as \"he is convinced it will happen\", but rather \"he believes there's a real probability\")\n\n\\- which doesn't imply he isn't also worried about a coup by those three, should their interests align\n\n\\- \"Kadyrow and Prigoshin  receive all the money\" and equipment, army gets basically nothing. Mobilized are not get their pay - \"because everyone knows they are going to war without coming back\"\n\n\\- Soliders, reservists and others are very unhappy, even more so because kadyrow and prigoshin are getting all the privilege, while they themselves are sometimes not even handed out weapons (until right before the frontline, I assume), because of worries they will rebel.\n\n\\- Even in 2021, soldiers weren't receiving proper medical examination before being sent to Ukraine \"exercises\" and unfit soldiers were sent\n\n\\- The army had a lack of covid tests and procedures leading to a huge infection wave (in 2021, she was still military doctor, not FSB doctor, then).

            "body": "Heres the full thing  \n\n\n>WASHINGTON \u2014 Senior Russian military leaders recently had conversations to discuss when and how Moscow might use a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine, contributing to heightened concern in Washington and allied capitals, according to multiple senior American officials.\r  \nPresident Vladimir V. Putin was not a part of the conversations, which were held against the backdrop of Russia\u2019s intensifying nuclear rhetoric and battlefield setbacks.\r  \nBut the fact that senior Russian military leaders were even having the discussions alarmed the Biden administration because it showed how frustrated Russian generals were about their failures on the ground, and suggests that Mr. Putin\u2019s veiled threats to use nuclear weapons might not just be words.\r  \nStill, American officials said they had seen no evidence that the Russians were moving nuclear weapons into place or taking other tactical measures to prepare for a strike.\r  \nThe intelligence about the conversations was circulated inside the U.S. government in mid-October.\r  \nU.S. officials would not describe the scenarios the military leaders considered for use of a nuclear weapon. However, William J. Burns, the C.I.A. director, has previously said that Mr. Putin\u2019s \u201cpotential desperation\u201d to extract a victory in Ukraine and setbacks in the war could lead Russia to use one.\r  \nJohn F. Kirby, a National Security Council official, declined to comment on \u201cthe particulars of this reporting.\u201d\r  \n\u201cWe\u2019ve been clear from the outset that Russia\u2019s comments about the potential use of nuclear weapons are deeply concerning, and we take them seriously,\u201d Mr. Kirby said. \u201cWe continue to monitor this as best we can, and we see no indications that Russia is making preparations for such use.\u201d\r  \nThe Pentagon estimates that Russia has a stockpile of as many as 2,000 tactical nuclear weapons, which are designed to be used on battlefields to overwhelm conventional forces. No tactical nuclear weapon has ever been used in combat, but one could be deployed any number of ways, including by missile or artillery shell.\r  \nTactical nuclear weapons carry lower yields and are meant to be used at shorter ranges than the warheads carried on intercontinental ballistic missiles.\r  \nMilitary experts say the use of a nuclear weapon \u2014 for the first time in more than 75 years \u2014 would fundamentally change the shape of war. Although the resulting destruction would depend on many factors, including the weapon\u2019s size and the winds, even a small nuclear explosion could cause thousands of deaths and render parts of Ukraine uninhabitable.\r  \nMr. Putin has sole authority over whether to use a tactical device and would make the decision to deploy one regardless of the views of his generals.\r  \nThe new intelligence surfaced when Moscow was also promoting the baseless notion that Ukraine was planning to use a so-called dirty bomb \u2014 a conventional explosive laced with radioactive material. And it came amid a flurry of contacts between U.S. and other Western officials and their Russian counterparts, including two calls between Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and the Russian defense minister, Sergei K. Shoigu.\r  \nWhile the risk of further escalation remains troublingly high, Biden administration officials and U.S. allies also say that the phone calls between Western and Russian counterparts late last month helped ease some of the nuclear tensions. A speech by Mr. Putin last Thursday in which he denied that Moscow was preparing to use a nuclear weapon in Ukraine further lowered the temperature, according to some of the officials.\r  \n\u201cWe see no need for that,\u201d Mr. Putin said in his speech. \u201cThere is no point in that, neither political, nor military.\u201d\r  \nSince Russia invaded Ukraine in February and suffered significant casualties, Mr. Putin himself has fanned fears that he might resort to a nuclear weapon.\r  \nA European official said the speech was seen among allies as part of Mr. Putin\u2019s regular pattern of inflaming tensions, watching the reaction of the West and his own public, then taking steps to calm the situation.\r  \nRussia conducted an annual military exercise last week testing nuclear-capable missiles. Mr. Austin said U.S. officials did not believe the maneuvers were \u201csome kind of cover activity\u201d to use a tactical nuclear weapon against Ukraine.\r  \nIn Washington, administration officials say they still do not think Mr. Putin has made plans to use a tactical nuclear weapon or even a dirty bomb.\r  \n\u201cWe have not seen anything to indicate that Putin has made a decision to use a dirty bomb,\u201d Mr. Austin told reporters at the Pentagon last Thursday. He said that even talk of the use of nuclear weapons was \u201cdangerous.\u201d\r  \nBut he said the administration was \u201ccertainly concerned about escalation,\u201d as it has been since the war started.\r  \n\u201cIt would be the first time a nuclear weapon has been used in over 70 years,\u201d he said. \u201cIf this happened, we have been clear from the very beginning that you would see a very significant response from the international community.\u201d\r  \nBiden administration officials have steadfastly refused to publicly describe what that response would be, but the president has indicated he has no plans to retaliate with an American nuclear device.\r  \n\u201cI\u2019m the guy that makes the recommendation to my boss on what we should do and how we should do it, and so I\u2019ll make sure that he has credible responses that are actually effective in terms of what we want to do,\u201d Mr. Austin said, without elaborating.\r  \nFor Mr. Putin, using a smaller-yield, tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine presents more complications than ordering the firing of a strategic weapon, like an ICBM. Moving a tactical nuclear weapon is not simply a matter of giving an order and having two people turn keys.\r  \nThere would be practical steps that Russian commanders would be alerted to be ready to carry out, including how to mitigate any risk to Russian military personnel in the blast area.\r  \n\u201cIf there\u2019s an order from the Kremlin, it can\u2019t just magically happen,\u201d Peter B. Zwack, a retired one-star Army general who was the American defense attach\u00e9 in Moscow from 2012 to 2014, said in an interview last week.\r  \nFrom the beginning of the war, American intelligence agencies have been looking for signs that Mr. Putin is taking preparatory steps to use a nuclear weapon, such as undeclared nuclear exercises or strategic forces being put on alert.\r  \nBut American officials said that the warning systems to detect such steps were imperfect, and that there was no guarantee that military or intelligence officials would be able to give the White House much advance warning. That is one reason the intelligence about the Russian discussions was viewed with such interest.\r  \nWith the high-level nuclear discussions, the Russian military is weighing what might prompt Moscow\u2019s use of a tactical weapon. And any additional intense discussions among senior leaders about the use of a nuclear weapon is something American officials have been profoundly concerned about \u2014 especially if Russia\u2019s army in the south of Ukraine were to collapse.\r  \nTensions over nuclear weapon use have been rising steadily since Ukraine\u2019s successful counteroffensive in early September.\r  \nSince then, Mr. Putin has taken steps to escalate the conflict \u2014 calling for a mobilization, annexing territory in Ukraine, getting more directly involved in war planning, and approving a campaign to attack and degrade the electrical power grid of Ukraine with cruise missiles and Iranian drones.\r  \nThose steps have not changed Russia\u2019s fortunes, and Ukrainian forces continue to move forward on fronts in the northeast and the south.\r  \nStill, some of those escalatory moves, like bringing in more troops, could have more impact on the battlefield by early next year.\r  \nOfficials expect intense fighting to continue into next month, but muddier conditions and colder weather in the next few weeks could force a pause into earlier next year.",

The current strategy, of a mitigated Ukrainian hold, does not seem sustainable to me. US armories are built for shock and awe, not prolonged conflict.

But at this point, Biden has sent a siginificant amount of aid to Ukraine, such that a Ukrainian defeat would just be embarassing for his legacy. So why is he not trying harder to win it? Escalation arguments are non-sensical now that Russia is using Iranian ballistic missiles to hit infrastructure.

I agree at this point F-16&#39;s aren&#39;t showing up unless theres contractors.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Similarly Abrams</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Wow you&#39;re such an expert that General Hodges is wrong and you&#39;re correct.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWq-ngg7JC8&amp;t=553s&amp;ab_channel=Perun\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWq-ngg7JC8&amp;t=553s&amp;ab_channel=Perun</a></p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t know why people can&#39;t accept it&#39;s politics not sustainment or logistics lmao.
