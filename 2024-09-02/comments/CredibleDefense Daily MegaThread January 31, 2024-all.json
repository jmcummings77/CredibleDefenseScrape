To oust one of the most popular figures in Ukraine would be deeply controversial, and would mark a pivotal moment in Ukraine\u2019s conflict with Russia. So far, Mr Zelensky has not announced that the general is being replaced. But that does not mean that General Zaluzhny\u2019s job is safe. It may simply be that his replacement has not yet been lined up.\n\n>It was not the first time a plan to remove the general has been mooted, but it was the most convincing. A dramatic day began with leaks from MPs, who had been informed, possibly strategically, about a \u201cset of documents\u201d sent to a security committee for signing. Later, sources in the general staff and close to General Zaluzhny confirmed that a shake-up was in the works. The Economist has been able to confirm that an early-evening meeting took place at which the president informed his general that he had decided to dismiss him.

To oust one of the most popular figures in Ukraine would be deeply controversial, and would mark a pivotal moment in Ukraine\u2019s conflict with Russia. So far, Mr Zelensky has not announced that the general is being replaced. But that does not mean that General Zaluzhny\u2019s job is safe. It may simply be that his replacement has not yet been lined up.</p>\n\n<p>It was not the first time a plan to remove the general has been mooted, but it was the most convincing. A dramatic day began with leaks from MPs, who had been informed, possibly strategically, about a \u201cset of documents\u201d sent to a security committee for signing. Later, sources in the general staff and close to General Zaluzhny confirmed that a shake-up was in the works. The Economist has been able to confirm that an early-evening meeting took place at which the president informed his general that he had decided to dismiss him. Mr Zaluzhny was offered another role: secretary of the national security council. He turned it down.</p>\n\n<p>News of the plan was soon leaked to local media. The defence ministry and presidential palace denied that the general had been dismissed, which was technically true.

Nearly <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/almost-4-in-10-israelis-back-a-revival-of-jewish-settlements-in-gaza-poll-finds/\">40% of Israelis support settlements in Gaza</a> according to a recent poll, which is an issue I suspect was nearly universally rejected prior to Oct. 7th. </p>\n\n<p>The US can credibly defend Israeli&#39;s military actions in Gaza as self-defense, but if they remove 90% of the population from the north half of Gaza and start re-settling it with Israelis, claims of ethnic cleansing can no longer be ignored.

Fighter pilots often focus on the air-to-air portion, but as a multi-role fighter all the air-to-ground capabilities of the APG-83 are the next thing that stands out, and the fact that you can multi-task with the AESA between air-to-air and air-to-surface, so you can be taking air-to-ground maps at the same time you\u2019re doing air-to-air engagements.*\n\n*This radar has SAR [Synthetic Aperture Radar] mapping capabilities, so we can get pictures of targets. Those earlier mech-scan radars were very good for their time, but the first time you saw a contact you\u2019d better do something because even though it just popped up it\u2019s already a threat! Whereas now with our AESA I\u2019m going to see a target long before it\u2019s a threat and I\u2019ve got time to work out my tactics.*\n\n*The big 6x8-inch [Center Pedestal Display or CPD] in the cockpit really is a nice piece of gear. The F-16 for a long time had two 4x4-inch displays each side of the Head Up Display, but now with the big center display [augmenting these] there\u2019s so much more space to display different things. Whether it\u2019s Sniper targeting pod imagery or the SAR maps I was talking about, you can put those on the big display. Everything is completely reconfigurable on those three screens, you can move anything around. You can have it so you see air-to-air and air-to-surface radar pictures both at the same time, with Sniper pod footage maybe on another display. Having that big workspace is really helpful.*\n\n*The Block 70 comes as standard with Conformal Fuel Tanks [CFTs] and having that extra 3,000lbs of gas is really helpful. Of course, the CFTs can come on and off by maintenance as necessary depending on the mission you have. The Block 70 is a package that takes all of the developments from the different Blocks over the years \u2013 the Link 16, the AESA radar, the center display, the integrated avionics and new mission computer \u2013 a gigantic package of improvements.*\n\n*The Block 70 started life as the F-16V upgrade for Taiwan, as well as upgrades for Singapore, Greece and South Korea who all bought into the F-16V package. There was also so much excitement from those who didn\u2019t have existing jets available that could be upgraded, so Lockheed Martin decided to offer a brand new aircraft in the F-16V standard, adding in a 12,000 flight hour service life, the CFTs and the drag chute as standard in the new-build Block 70/72. It also comes with the choice of engine \u2013 the Block 70 has the General Electric F110-GE-129 and the Block 72 has the Pratt & Whitney F100-PW-229.*\n\n*It has auto GCAS [Automatic Ground-Collision Avoidance System] too, a life-saving capability that\u2019s been around in various portions of the Viper fleet for years and now it\u2019s baked into these Block 70s. When you buy one of these, all the development that\u2019s gone in the past 50 years in various portions of the Viper community is there in one package.\"*\n\n**Does the Block 70/72 have any of the sensor fusion or any other features that have come from the F-35?**\n\n*RB: \"We are able to share amongst all the different platforms at Lockheed Martin, for example, the radar shares 95% software commonality and 70% hardware commonality with the F-35 radar. There\u2019s a lot of correlation ability in the F-16V and the Block 70 that we are now able to correlate effectively the different sensors that we\u2019ve got. Correlate those tracks, I\u2019m seeing something with my radar, something on Link 16, interrogation returns, and those can all get melded into one track that\u2019s being seen by the pilot. On that big center screen I can put a horizontal situation display and all of my sensors basically get correlated into one.\"*\n\nYes the F-35s & 22s are getting upgrades.\n\n[[Video] The F-35 Lightning II is about receive new upgrades that include 17 new weapon systems, powerful new radar, expanded electronic warfare capabilities, propulsion upgrades, and more | Sandboxx | 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SNALUoybt0)\n\n[The F-35 Gets A New Brain: The TR-3 upgrades will come with an improved electronic warfare processor offering 3x the power of the F-35\u2019s current system.

I'm not sure it can be entirely levied at Uraltransmash, the state testing program for the Koalitsiya did not end until late October 2023 and the initial test articles and the first batch of serial production are already well on their way if that delivery date sticks. That seems like a healthy turnaround time, unless state testing was delayed due to deficiencies on the manufacturers side, if that's the case that statement makes a lot more sense but there could be some deflection and politicking going on from Shoigu here.\n\nThe Koalitsiya program has been long delayed, they were originally meant to enter service back in 2016 and had they done so a large number of them would have been ready from the outset of the war, not nearly two years in as a mad scramble to improve counter battery operations. Whilst we don't have much credible information on the cause, to me at least, this comes across as deflection from the relatively late outcome of the state acceptance trials.\n\n>**eight MSTA-Ss to be delivered in January, 18 planned in February**.\n\nThere isn't much to be gleaned from this on annual production totals as we don't know if these numbers are heavily front loaded in batches, some Russian vehicle programs deliver in batches and go several months without delivering vehicles in any meaningful quantities. That being said if these monthly totals are recurring and consistent then it's certainly enough to start very slowly replacing their MSTA losses. Granted it's going to take significant time to fill that gap measured in years, but I would imagine any replacements would be welcome to maintain the artillery advantage they currently hold over Ukraine.\n\n>General Director of Uraltransmash JSC Oleg Emelyanov reported to the head of the Russian military department that the production volume of self-propelled artillery units\u00a0\\~has increased 6 times compared to 2022.\\~\n\n>During the inspection, the head of the Russian military department clarified plans for the coming months of work. The head of the enterprise reported that the plan was being fulfilled and there was still capacity to increase production.\n\n6 times seems excessive, but maybe the production rate has just been extremely low and efforts to increase this lethargic? This might explain why Shoigu was being so critical. I also wonder what qualifies as SPG production, are they including refurbishments, repairs of returned vehicles? If it's just exclusively new unit production then that's impressive, although I'm sure there will be some element of \"devil in the details\" here.\n\nThey also list several vehicle types that no longer have active serial production, so I have to imagine some degree of refurbishments are being taken into account, in the same way they mix the two numbers for tank production. \n\nAt the end of the day artillery is artillery and if Russia can keep it supplied, regardless of age, it's going to have a quantity/quality all of its own.
