Then again, as everyone who knows how militaries function, 3-4 star generals are always more politician than soldier. \n\nFirst, the pitch that they need to create 10-20 new brigades (and other support units they don't mention) so they can launch an offensive to retake Crimea borders. What that means is they want NATO to give them 10-20 new brigades worth of equipment on top of what they need for the rest of the force structure. Just for reference, that's in the realm of 40-80 maneuver battalions worth of APCs, IFVs, and tanks, and that's 20-40 battalions worth of tube artillery. \n\nSecond, the middle part reads like a sales pitch for ATACMS. I guess they still aren't happy being told no. \n\nWhy were they told no? They even brought the reason up, but did it in a way that proves it was a very good reason not to give them ATACMS:\n\n\"As a forced step, which is still extremely necessary, we must return to the source of Russian confidence, which is impunity. Any Russian attempts at practical steps in the use of tactical nuclear weapons must be pre-empted by employing the entire arsenal of means at the disposal of world powers.\"\n\nThey clearly want NATO to preemptively start WW3, to include using nukes, to prevent Russian tactical nuke saber rattling towards Ukraine.

Then again, as everyone who knows how militaries function, 3-4 star generals are always more politician than soldier. </p>\n\n<p>First, the pitch that they need to create 10-20 new brigades (and other support units they don&#39;t mention) so they can launch an offensive to retake Crimea borders. What that means is they want NATO to give them 10-20 new brigades worth of equipment on top of what they need for the rest of the force structure. Just for reference, that&#39;s in the realm of 40-80 maneuver battalions worth of APCs, IFVs, and tanks, and that&#39;s 20-40 battalions worth of tube artillery. </p>\n\n<p>Second, the middle part reads like a sales pitch for ATACMS. I guess they still aren&#39;t happy being told no. </p>\n\n<p>Why were they told no? They even brought the reason up, but did it in a way that proves it was a very good reason not to give them ATACMS:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;As a forced step, which is still extremely necessary, we must return to the source of Russian confidence, which is impunity. Any Russian attempts at practical steps in the use of tactical nuclear weapons must be pre-empted by employing the entire arsenal of means at the disposal of world powers.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>They clearly want NATO to preemptively start WW3, to include using nukes, to prevent Russian tactical nuke saber rattling towards Ukraine. I sure hope it doesn&#39;t come to that, NATO leaders have a responsibility to their own people far greater than to Ukraine.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "> **[US military working on analysis to shape and support Ukraine's military in long term](https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/07/politics/us-military-ukraine-analysis/index.html)**\n\n>The Pentagon is preparing detailed analysis and working out how to support Ukraine's military in the medium and long term, including after the war with Russia has ended, according to three defense officials.\n\n>The efforts are being led by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley and would build on the billions of dollars in military aid the US has given to Ukraine since Russia invaded in February.\n\n>The process is at an early stage and a senior defense official said it is looking at the \"future of Ukrainian forces,\" aiming to answer key questions about \"what makes sense?\" and \"what do we want Ukraine to start having in the mid and the long term?\" in terms of military support. As well as the current conflict, which is expected to be lengthy, the US is looking, at least, at the next five years after the war is over.\n\n>\"What are the things that if we wanted to imagine with Ukraine, what their future force would be, let's say if they want to be a maneuver force and they want to have these defensive capabilities as well as offensive capabilities, what seems to make sense?\" the official told CNN.\n\n>The analysis is being conducted in conjunction with the Ukrainians and if approved by President Joe Biden it could lead to years of future arms sales and the establishment of a long-term military training program by the US. It would be presented to Kyiv as an assessment, but it would provide a clear road map showing how the US believes it should develop its military.\n\n>The analysis is expected to **\"come together in the next month or two,\"** the senior defense official said, emphasizing that **Ukraine's views will be central to the final effort.** \"What's their strategy, what do they want?\" they added. The effort will continuously evolve over the next few months as the battlefield shifts and Ukraine's forces advance.\n\n>The initial effort could lead to recommendations for weapons and training, depending on the military strategy Ukraine approves. That could ultimately extend US and allied involvement with Ukraine for years to come through long-term, multi-year weapons contracts that could be initially finalized before the end of Biden's first term.\n\n> **'Defending Ukraine for years to come'**\n\n>Last month when discussing aid to Ukraine, Colin Kahl the Department of Defense undersecretary for policy, noted \"While many of these capabilities are not intended to directly contribute to today's fight, they will form the backbone of a robust future Ukrainian force, capable of defending Ukraine for years to come.\"\n\n>The US assessment and initial plans **could be discussed when Milley and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin meet counterparts from allied countries in Germany on Thursday.**\n\n>The analysis and planning follow a recent war game the US and Ukraine conducted in advance of the current counteroffensive into the Kherson region. **Some of the lessons learned from that war game are being incorporated, one of the officials said.**\n\n>The analysis will also include initial consideration of Ukraine's needs for a modernized air force of fixed wing and helicopter aircraft to support a highly mobile ground force, officials said.\n\n>While Ukrainian air forces firing long-range HARM missiles are having some success, **the US is looking at helping make Ukraine's ground forces, which have proven successful in the most recent combat operations, more maneuverable.**\n\n>The Pentagon has also established a working group intended to streamline the foreign military sales process, according to two defense officials.\n\n>Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks created the group, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, which will help allies and partners including Ukraine with their requests for US military equipment. **Ultimately, this effort could streamline the process for Ukraine to purchase advanced American weaponry, as the US and NATO seek to transition Ukraine's military away from Soviet-era equipment to modern Western weapons.**\n\n> **Weapons and hardware**\n\n>Ukraine currently **has an inventory of roughly 1,000 drones of various capabilities**, according to Pentagon officials. The US and Ukrainians are finding that **drones with shorter ranges and small amounts of explosives may not be as useful as larger drones**, the senior defense official said. **Therefore, it's expected a long-awaited contract for 10 Switchblade 600 drones equipped with anti-armor warheads could be issued within a month**. After that, decisions could come on what, if any, additional airborne capabilities are needed.\n\n>**One of Ukraine's most enduring needs is for an ongoing supply of 155 mm artillery ammunition. The Ukrainians are using it at a high rate and the US will have to replenish its own stockpiles**\n\n>**The Pentagon issued $364 million in contracts late last month to a variety of US and international suppliers. \"This is a big deal,\" said William LaPlante, undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, told CNN. \"I can't say the sources, but they are around the world.\"**\n\n>**The goal is to deliver 100,000 rounds in 90 days and 15,000 a month after that.**\n\n>The longer-term goal is to deliver more than 30,000 rounds a month in the next two to three years. Separately, another defense official said a contract is expected from the Army in the coming days to begin to replenish US 155 mm ammunition stocks due to the high volume being sent to Ukraine.\n\n>**Current US production is about 15,000 rounds a month at facilities in Pennsylvania but additional government funding is aimed at getting production up to more than 30,000 rounds a month.**\n\n>The Pentagon is working with industry across the board to increase production rates for both export to Ukraine and to rebuild US stockpiles of munitions and launch systems.\n\n>To alleviate the pressure on US supplies, several additional production contracts have been issued since April for surface-to-air missile systems, additional unmanned aerial vehicles, radars and highly precise ground-launched rockets with advanced fuses designed to limit civilian casualties in close combat.\n\n>To replenish US weapons stocks from the drawdown of inventory sent to Ukraine, the US has issued several critical contracts since May including: $624 million to Raytheon for Stinger missile systems; $352 million to Raytheon and Lockheed Martin for the Javelin anti-armor system; $33 million to Lockheed for HIMARS multiple rocket launcher, and $8 million to AeroVironment for smaller Switchblade drones. \n\n> **The Pentagon also hopes to more than double monthly HIMARS production to 12 launchers per month.**\n\n>The US is also looking at **funding modifications to existing systems such as the Boeing Insitu ScanEagle unmanned aerial vehicle to allow Ukraine to use them to collect vital electronic battlefield intelligence on Russian targets such as radar and electronic communications systems.**",

That could ultimately extend US and allied involvement with Ukraine for years to come through long-term, multi-year weapons contracts that could be initially finalized before the end of Biden&#39;s first term.</p>\n\n<p><strong>&#39;Defending Ukraine for years to come&#39;</strong></p>\n\n<p>Last month when discussing aid to Ukraine, Colin Kahl the Department of Defense undersecretary for policy, noted &quot;While many of these capabilities are not intended to directly contribute to today&#39;s fight, they will form the backbone of a robust future Ukrainian force, capable of defending Ukraine for years to come.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The US assessment and initial plans <strong>could be discussed when Milley and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin meet counterparts from allied countries in Germany on Thursday.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The analysis and planning follow a recent war game the US and Ukraine conducted in advance of the current counteroffensive into the Kherson region. <strong>Some of the lessons learned from that war game are being incorporated, one of the officials said.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The analysis will also include initial consideration of Ukraine&#39;s needs for a modernized air force of fixed wing and helicopter aircraft to support a highly mobile ground force, officials said.</p>\n\n<p>While Ukrainian air forces firing long-range HARM missiles are having some success, <strong>the US is looking at helping make Ukraine&#39;s ground forces, which have proven successful in the most recent combat operations, more maneuverable.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Pentagon has also established a working group intended to streamline the foreign military sales process, according to two defense officials.</p>\n\n<p>Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks created the group, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, which will help allies and partners including Ukraine with their requests for US military equipment. <strong>Ultimately, this effort could streamline the process for Ukraine to purchase advanced American weaponry, as the US and NATO seek to transition Ukraine&#39;s military away from Soviet-era equipment to modern Western weapons.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Weapons and hardware</strong></p>\n\n<p>Ukraine currently <strong>has an inventory of roughly 1,000 drones of various capabilities</strong>, according to Pentagon officials. The US and Ukrainians are finding that <strong>drones with shorter ranges and small amounts of explosives may not be as useful as larger drones</strong>, the senior defense official said. <strong>Therefore, it&#39;s expected a long-awaited contract for 10 Switchblade 600 drones equipped with anti-armor warheads could be issued within a month</strong>. After that, decisions could come on what, if any, additional airborne capabilities are needed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>One of Ukraine&#39;s most enduring needs is for an ongoing supply of 155 mm artillery ammunition. The Ukrainians are using it at a high rate and the US will have to replenish its own stockpiles</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The Pentagon issued $364 million in contracts late last month to a variety of US and international suppliers. &quot;This is a big deal,&quot; said William LaPlante, undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, told CNN. &quot;I can&#39;t say the sources, but they are around the world.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The goal is to deliver 100,000 rounds in 90 days and 15,000 a month after that.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The longer-term goal is to deliver more than 30,000 rounds a month in the next two to three years. Separately, another defense official said a contract is expected from the Army in the coming days to begin to replenish US 155 mm ammunition stocks due to the high volume being sent to Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Current US production is about 15,000 rounds a month at facilities in Pennsylvania but additional government funding is aimed at getting production up to more than 30,000 rounds a month.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Pentagon is working with industry across the board to increase production rates for both export to Ukraine and to rebuild US stockpiles of munitions and launch systems.</p>\n\n<p>To alleviate the pressure on US supplies, several additional production contracts have been issued since April for surface-to-air missile systems, additional unmanned aerial vehicles, radars and highly precise ground-launched rockets with advanced fuses designed to limit civilian casualties in close combat.</p>\n\n<p>To replenish US weapons stocks from the drawdown of inventory sent to Ukraine, the US has issued several critical contracts since May including: $624 million to Raytheon for Stinger missile systems; $352 million to Raytheon and Lockheed Martin for the Javelin anti-armor system; $33 million to Lockheed for HIMARS multiple rocket launcher, and $8 million to AeroVironment for smaller Switchblade drones. </p>\n\n<p><strong>The Pentagon also hopes to more than double monthly HIMARS production to 12 launchers per month.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The US is also looking at <strong>funding modifications to existing systems such as the Boeing Insitu ScanEagle unmanned aerial vehicle to allow Ukraine to use them to collect vital electronic battlefield intelligence on Russian targets such as radar and electronic communications systems.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Little more than hand weapons, some Stingers, some AT missiles and a bunch of pick-up trucks.... and maybe 2-4 weeks basic training. \n\nAs a result there only real use is \"parking them in a town or village, asking them to dig in, and using them to block russian attacks/counters\" whilst the better trained, more experienced, much better equipped military+reservists do all the \"military stuff\" that isn't \"sitting in a trench and shooting at russians that come within range\".\n\nAs a result, I think UA have plenty of troops they can use to follow along these attacking echelons and take over the newly abandoned russian positions and dig-into those further to hold the turf.\n\nI would completely expect the UAF to use them in this way in offensives with \"2-3 Battalions of TDF following along 5km behind the mechanised infantry brigade, with the sole purpose of squatting in the villages/towns the mechanised professional force liberate and preparing to rebuff a counter-attack\".\n\nThen, when there is any Ru counter-attack.... I'd expect the mechanised infantry brigade to withdraw *behind the emplaced TDF* .... let the Ru counter attack bash into the dug-in TDF line for 24-48hrs (whilst the Mechanised unit re-supplies, rests and refuels).... then the Mechanised Infantry to either launch a counter-counter-attack of their own (if the TDF held) or to rush in as the reserve support to bolster the line (if they don't).\n\nSo, any other NATO army, I'd also be worried there may be a problem with taking too much land. With the UAF having a large TDF force that can do little more than squat on land and defend it ? Not so much.

You can absolutely do mixed combat teams at the Company level. It's SOP in the Canadian forces to attach engineers and an armoured troop to an Infantry Company.  Second, I'd be keeping it at 4 sections / platoon (With a weapons detachment), with 4 platoons (12 additional sections and doubling the weapons detachment), each having a Second Lieutenant/Lieutenant as a Commander and a Second Lieutenant/Officer Cadet *(Another idea I have, of generating short service officers - Where some people are sent on a 6 month OCTU, spending 4-6 years at the platoon second in command/platoon commander (Different timeline/time in rank to the Captain level accounting for the 4 year age gap/education gap level before being sent for post-secondary education. or acting as a support platoon commander before release at the 9-10 year mark).*  \n\n\nThis gives each company commander 4 maneuver elements with additional enablers.  So, a Battalion Commander could pull 1 platoon back to replace with an armored troop, giving the additional depth. So that the BN would be at 4x 3x Inf/1x Armd Combat teams, with 1x 4 Inf Reserve ( with the armoured squadron providing HQ and Echelon) - Alternatively, you can leave 1 Company as a LOB pool, to account for causalities etc.\n\nAt the company level, there would be a larger echelon than normal obviously, (58 personnel over 100% peacetime manning) Adding in an Operations Officer (Captain) (Replaces the Battle Captain/Lav Captain), an Administration Officer, an Assistant Operations Officer (Lieutenant/Second Lieutenant), an additional Clerk (Sergeant / Master Corporal), an Intelligence Sergeant and an Operations Officer.  The real big addition would be with Mobile Repair teams  (3x teams Weapons/Vehicles and FCS) being added, an additional Recovery vehicle, and not just recovery vehicles , which is looking at 1 NCO and 9 ORs, as well as an additional medical technician.\n\nPlugging in a Mortar Section with Sergeant MFC+ Tech, and 2x 81mm Mortar teams and an additional ammo driver does give some additional fire support direct to the Company Comander. It only adds 10 personnel.\n\nEssentially your Company Command would look as follows:  \n**Coy Comd Tactical Party: (3x IFV)**  \n\\- OC  \n\\- Int Sgt  \n\\- Ops Offr  \n\\- 4x Radio Operators   \n\\- 2 x Vehicle Drivers (OC and Ops O have their Own Vehicles)  \n\\- 2x Vehicle Gunners  \n\\- FOO + FO Techs  \n\\- Company Sergeant Major  \n\n\n**Coy Main HQ: (1x IFV/1x CP)**  \n\\- Coy 2ic   \n\\- Ops WO  \n\\- 1x Signals Detachment (3 Signallers to monitor Coy /BN net)(Not Inf Signallers, but actual Signals Branch)  \n\\- Company Quartermaster Sergeant (CQMS) (If Co-located) (CQMS + Maint / Tpt NCO can act as duty officer, but handle Admin/Log Matters)   \n\\- Transport NCO  \n\\- Maintenance NCO  \n\\- 1x Clerk (Assistant Company Clerk)  \n\n\n**Coy Step Up HQ (1x CP + LO Rover)**  \n\\-Liaison Officer / Assistant Operations Officer (Recce Party as well as LO Party)  \n\\- Signals NCO + Signals Detachment  (Not Inf Signallers, but actual Signals Branch - Signals NCO is Infantry Sergeant)\n\n**B CP (Co-located at BN HQ) (Unarmoured CP/Office)**  \n\\- Admin Officer  \n\\- 1x Clerk  \n\\- 2ic CQMS (Ideally Master Corporal level)\n\nThis essentially gives you a robust tactical party to fight the immediate battle, an administrative and sustaining HQ that is redundant to handle the Admin side of battle, as well as a rearward headquarters for administration.  \n**A lot of this is grafting an Armoured Squadron's echelon onto an Infantry Company of 4 platoons, and not 3, with a few officers added for additional command and control.** \n\nExample of the increased Echelon - Just delete the tech reps and add 2 CPs really, and another truck or two:  [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/466816057118687232/956474767584677908/image.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/466816057118687232/956474767584677908/image.png)\n\n2. You mobilize your enablers from reserves before deployment. You don't hold them organically during peace time. For example, you can pull the FOO party in during pre-deployment training from a reserve unit and use the time to integrate them. This also preserves their career progression. You can also reduce the peacetime personnel bill by staffing at 60/80% and using reservists for major exercises.) I would not hold them organically at this level (During peace time you can leverage the Battalion Medical/Signals/Band platoons)\n\n3. The additional AT is actually turning back the clock to 1992, and issuing 1 Carl Gustav (with 6-8 rounds) per section to be held in it's carrier, as well as 1 Light role general purpose machine gun with 1400 rounds per platoon). Ideally you would have your TOW/Milan/Spike/ATGM platoon in the Support company to be broken out to combat teams, same with your HMG/DFS, Pioneers, and Battalion Mortars.\n\n4. In the Offense they do. However, in delay and defensive operations, I think it will be less of an affair. Most administration, logistics and liasion vehicles are wheeled. I've often thought of their use in Airmobile|Airlanding|Airborne/Dismounted/Motorized units vice Mechanized Units. The big question is, are they Infanteers with special anti armour training (Lengthening the length of any anti armour training), or are they Artillery personnel. \n\nI can draw it out again / send you my ideas if you want.

However, in delay and defensive operations, I think it will be less of an affair. Most administration, logistics and liasion vehicles are wheeled. I&#39;ve often thought of their use in Airmobile|Airlanding|Airborne/Dismounted/Motorized units vice Mechanized Units. The big question is, are they Infanteers with special anti armour training (Lengthening the length of any anti armour training), or are they Artillery personnel. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I can draw it out again / send you my ideas if you want.

It also has the capability to redirect itself if it senses radars near the target but that is optional. The other older/ more traditional modes likely aren't even available on the MIG-29. So even if your goal was to destroy air defense, it would make sense to pick the coordinates which would cause the most damage. But if you can hit an ammo stockpiles and take out the whole base an air defense radar suddenly seems insignificant in comparison.\n\nSecondly the warhead it smaller than GMLRS fired by HIMARS, but not by that much, around 2/3 the size. A problem perhaps if you want to hit hardened targets, but the famed Russian open air ammo stockpiles? The other suspect, small kamikaze drones, have smaller warheads.\n\nLastly it's not a novel idea, the US navy is ordering the SIAW air to ground missile, which is basically a variant of the latest HARM missiles.",

So even if your goal was to destroy air defense, it would make sense to pick the coordinates which would cause the most damage. But if you can hit an ammo stockpiles and take out the whole base an air defense radar suddenly seems insignificant in comparison.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly the warhead it smaller than GMLRS fired by HIMARS, but not by that much, around 2/3 the size. A problem perhaps if you want to hit hardened targets, but the famed Russian open air ammo stockpiles? The other suspect, small kamikaze drones, have smaller warheads.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly it&#39;s not a novel idea, the US navy is ordering the SIAW air to ground missile, which is basically a variant of the latest HARM missiles.</p>\n</div>",

A sort of two birds one stone manoeuvre if you will.\n\nI find this sort of situation fascinating because it may be in UA's best interests not to retake Kherson quickly. If Putin's political goals clash with a military reality of Kherson being unholdable, it could be one of UA's best chances to bleed the RU forces enough to make it possible to retake Melitopol and Mariupol later on. I saw a comment on here recently saying something to the effect of \"UA wants RU to leave Kherson -- they don't want to have to fight for it\". Indeed they don't want an urban battle to retake Kherson, but it also doesn't seem in their best interests for RU to leave too quickly either. With a quick and orderly RU retreat, I question whether they'd be able to move on to, and liberate, Melitopol and Mariupol later.

In recent days, Ukrainian forces have pushed towards Russian supply lines south of Kharkiv, taking several villages and towns in the process.\n\n>The current offensive in the south is broad-based -- extending more than 100 miles wide -- to prevent Russian units from concentrating on one point. Additionally, there has been an uptick in sabotage operations and attacks on pro-Russian officials in occupied areas.\n\n>**US officials acknowledge the Ukrainian goal of recapturing Kherson by the end of 2022 is ambitious but remains possible if Ukraine continues to make progress in its current operations.**\n\n>**Ukrainian forces are planning for a long and brutal campaign to retake Russian-controlled territory. The current Ukrainian push is expected to extend into the Spring, with some of the attacks now intended to prepare the battlefield for planned advances over the next several months.**\n\n>Ukraine has been publicly signaling for months that it intended to launch a major counteroffensive to retake territory lost to Russia in the six-month war.\n\n>And even before Ukrainian forces began increasing their artillery rocket and missile fire on the front lines in southern Ukraine, Kyiv had been actively disrupting Russian resupply efforts and command and control across the region.\n\n> **In the buildup to the current Ukrainian counteroffensive, the US urged Kyiv to keep the operation limited in both its objectives and its geography to avoid getting overextended and bogged down on multiple fronts, multiple US and western officials and Ukrainian sources previously told CNN.**\n\n>Those discussions involved engaging in \"war-gaming\" with Kyiv, the sources said -- analytical exercises that were intended to help the Ukrainian forces understand what force levels they would need to muster to be successful in different scenarios.\n\n>**The Ukrainians were initially considering a broader counteroffensive, but narrowed their mission to the south, in the Kherson region, in recent weeks, US and Ukrainian officials previously said.**",

Russian forces in Kherson have a perilous supply situation which weakens their fighting ability and saps morale. On top of that, Kherson is essentially a giant cauldron/salient that leaves their forces exposed to Ukrainian air power and artillery (they can't concentrate AD or artillery as easily, think a huge SD/Lysychansk but reversed).

To be fair to the russians, the path to crimea is all steppe so just giving up for the few small settlements there is would also be a pretty bad option.</p>\n\n<p>So I think Ukraine was trying one of either scenario.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Russia&#39;s decide Kherson aint worth it, and try to dig in the small settlements around crimea. Massive Political Loss for Russia, and of course a retreat of one of the largest gains of the initial advance.</li>\n<li>Russia decides to stay in fight and atleast try to keep it. They also could just win this still of course too, so it&#39;s not like its a  honor-based lost stand - and for ukraine do you really want them to tanks rolling in constantly? Those bridges took months to fully knock out, the digged in forces are already pretty hardboiled don&#39;t want new equipment coming in easily - Ukraine shouldn&#39;t bite off more than it can chew. The downside for russia is what we are seeing now that the unwillingness to pour more forces into the country is drastically harming other areas, especially with kharkiv.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>",

There was almost no resistance until the Russians reached the Antonovsky Bridge and Nova Kakhovka, which are ~60-70 km from the border. The units that headed east didn't run into resistance until making it to Melitopol, over 100 km from the border. That's the reason why the Russian Southern Military District basically exploded out of Crimea, nobody was defending it.\n\nMariupol was very close to the JFO border when the war started, was attacked from the east on day 1, and had the Russians on their backs coming the west and Crimea [within two days](https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/DraftUkraineCoTFeb26%2C2022.png). \n\nThere is no way that UAF brigades stationed in OC-N, that weren't even ready and mobilized until less than 24 hours before the war started, would have been able to make it to Mariupol to block anything. \n\n>That is purely hypothetical though, that was never going to happen.

There was almost no resistance until the Russians reached the Antonovsky Bridge and Nova Kakhovka, which are ~60-70 km from the border. The units that headed east didn&#39;t run into resistance until making it to Melitopol, over 100 km from the border. That&#39;s the reason why the Russian Southern Military District basically exploded out of Crimea, nobody was defending it.</p>\n\n<p>Mariupol was very close to the JFO border when the war started, was attacked from the east on day 1, and had the Russians on their backs coming the west and Crimea <a href=\"https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/DraftUkraineCoTFeb26%2C2022.png\">within two days</a>. </p>\n\n<p>There is no way that UAF brigades stationed in OC-N, that weren&#39;t even ready and mobilized until less than 24 hours before the war started, would have been able to make it to Mariupol to block anything. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>That is purely hypothetical though, that was never going to happen.

They need training on them at the individual and unit level up to battalion level, they also need laser or passive aiming devices, IR beacons, IR signaling lasers, and other toys. They need LOTS and LOTS of batteries. I used NVGs extensively during my time in the military, including combat, they're not as simple as just putting them on.

That guy said the Western troops were trying to pressure the Ukrainians to do night ops even without NVGs, but the UAF and Russians/LDNR had developed some sort of unofficial agreement during the Donbas War that they wouldn't fight each other at night.

They can become a giant pain in the ass if the force doesn't have very strong doctrine and focus for low light ops.

It won't be a fun night doing a patrol to find out if they have them, it means potentially walking right into an ambush. \n\nLastly, it's one thing to perform night patrols in forests or cities, quite another in the steppe country of the Kherson bridgehead area, which is long and flat, with lots of Russian arty around.

            "body": "You know. Demographics don't matter, neither does mobilization. Both are really words. The demographic problem is longer than the next twelve months, and mobilization will take a long time. \n\nSimply calling up troops doesn't help, they need to be trained, equipped and build cohesiveness. Does Russia have sufficient stocks to replenish their armed forces? Not just in tanks or jets, but radios, field kitchens and B Vehicles? Dribbling in infantry replacements or replacement crewmen doesn't work on the line. There's a reason why the armoured delivery regiment was  to provide replacement vehicles -and- crews to armoured units. Same with other replacement units.\n\nCould Russia, in all honesty build up a 200,000 person army? To replace an invasion force which is essentially for all intents and purposes destroyed (Or a better term, combat ineffective and requiring rotation, replenishment and re-equipping)?

They are also the ones who regularly violate these rules, changing them to suit their agenda depending on how things are going at any given moment.\n\nNot wrong to be fair.\n\n>> Europe is about to\u00a0throw its achievements in\u00a0building up its manufacturing capability, the\u00a0quality of\u00a0life of\u00a0its people and\u00a0socioeconomic stability into the\u00a0sanctions furnace, depleting its potential, as\u00a0directed by\u00a0Washington for\u00a0the\u00a0sake of\u00a0the\u00a0infamous Euro-Atlantic unity.

Europe suffers whilst the US consolidates its hold on key markets.\n\n>> Gazprom and its Chinese partners decided to switch to 50/50 transactions in rubles and yuan with respect to gas payments.\n\nInteresting\n\n>> while in 2019, according to the UN, 135 million people in the world were facing acute food insecurity, their number has soared by 2.5 times to 345 million by now \u2013 this is just horrible.\n\nWon't somebody think of the global poor!\n\n>> (re Ukrainian grain shipments) Russia did it together with Turkey. We did it. And I would like to report the result to you, colleagues: if we exclude Turkey as an intermediary, all the grain exported from Ukraine, almost in its entirety, went to the European Union, not to the developing and poorest countries. Only two ships delivered grain under the UN World Food Programme \u2013 the very programme that is supposed to help countries that need help the most \u2013 only two ships out of 87 \u2013 I emphasise \u2013 transported 60,000 tonnes out of 2 million tonnes of food. That's just 3 percent, and it went to the developing countries.\n\nGrim reading if true\n\n>> Russia is coping well with the economic, financial and technological aggression of the West. I am talking about a real aggression; there is no other word for it. Russia\u2019s currency and financial market has stabilised, inflation is going down, as I have already mentioned, and the unemployment rate is at an all-time historical low of less than 4 percent. The assessments and forecasts of our economic performance, including by businesspeople, are more optimistic now than in early spring.\n\nBold claim\n\n>> An absolute majority of Asia Pacific countries reject the destructive logic of sanctions. \n\nHas putin been reading my posts?\n\n>> In\u00a0the\u00a0past seven years, industrial production volumes in\u00a0the\u00a0Far East have increased by\u00a0about 25 percent. This exceeds nationwide levels by\u00a0one third... We will continue to\u00a0promote the\u00a0priority development of\u00a0the\u00a0Far Eastern regions\u00a0\n\nThe Asian pivot continues apace.\n\n>> Russia is just about the only country that is completely self-sufficient in terms of natural resources... From now on, only companies with Russian jurisdiction have the right to develop natural resources in Russia.\n\nMakes sense\n\n>> It is noteworthy that despite the attempts of external pressure, the total cargo of Russian seaports has only slightly decreased over the seven months of this year; it has remained at the same level as a year earlier, which is about 482 million tonnes of cargo. Last year there were 483 million, so the figure is practically the same.\n\nBe interesting to see the covid effect here\n\n>> In a word, no matter how much someone might like to isolate Russia, it is impossible to do it, as we have always said so. It is enough just to look at the map.\n\n>> our focus is on building the eastward infrastructure and developing the North-South international corridor and ports of the Azov-Black Sea basin which we will keep working on. They will open up more opportunities for Russian companies to enter the markets of Iran, India, the Middle East and Africa and, of course, for reciprocal deliveries from these countries.\n\n>> The total volume of freight and cargo transportation along these routes and arteries will be able to grow by about 60 percent by 2030. We are absolutely realistic about our predictions, and this is how it will be. \n\nTime will tell\n\n>> The\u00a0Government has approved a\u00a0development plan for\u00a0the\u00a0Northern Sea Route until 2035 with plans to\u00a0allocate 1.8 trillion rubles from various sources to\u00a0implement it. As\u00a0forecasted, the\u00a0cargo traffic along this corridor will go from the\u00a0current 35 million tonnes per year to\u00a0the\u00a0targeted 220 million tonnes per year.\n\nCertainly has potential, but time will tell.\n\n>> we have established a single Far Eastern airline.

To implement these plans, we need to expand the company's fleet, to make sure it has modern aircraft, including small aircraft... Russian air carriers will soon be thoroughly re-equipped. Our airlines, including Aeroflot, have placed the largest order package in modern history, for about 500 Russian-made mainline aircraft. \n\nBold plans...

Russian diplomats in recent months have worked energetically to deflect criticism of Moscow by suggesting that Western sanctions, rather than Russia\u2019s actions, are to blame for the crisis.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This also completely ignores the fact that regardless of what percentage of grains went where, 100% of the exports benefit Ukraine, a developing country in desperate need of money, and Russia, a poor backwards country that&#39;s been overtaken by its former colonies in the Baltic by every measurable standard.</p>\n</div>",

In\u00a0fact, this amounts to\u00a0sacrifices in\u00a0the\u00a0name of\u00a0preserving the\u00a0dominance of\u00a0the\u00a0United States in\u00a0global affairs.\n\nHe's not completely wrong here. Europe will bear the brunt of the short term pain in this affair. But the US-Europe alliance has always been in part an economic alliance in return for a military alliance. The long-term costs of Europe losing economic alignment with the US would be far more painful than the short term pain of losing Russian energy. \n\nI get why Putin plays this card over and over, because it's the one piece of leverage he has on Europe, but the truth is that American consumer markets are far more important economically to Europe than Russian energy. \n\nWhen you view it through that lens of economic tradeoffs, it makes sense why it's an easy choice for Europe, even if there is going to short term pain aplenty. \n\n>Gazprom and its Chinese partners decided to switch to 50/50 transactions in rubles and yuan with respect to gas payments.\n\nThis is interesting to me. I'm curious why they didn't commit to 100% of the payments in Yuan. To get Rubles, China will need to export enough goods to Russia in exchange for Rubles to meet 50% of the value of energy exports (Chinese exporters won't want to hold Rubles, so there will need to be a program to sell them to Chinese state banks). Or China will need to buy Rubles from the Russian central bank, probably exchanging Dollars or Euros, which in effect would be a roundabout way for Russia to acquire Dollars or Euros while politically making it seem like Rubles are the medium of exchange.",

When we discussed this, that was the understanding.</p>\n\n<p>What we see is more audacious deceit. And they did not deceive us: they deceived the international community, their partners in Africa and other countries that desperately needed food. It is a con job, impudence and disgraceful conduct towards the partners who were supposed to benefit from the deal. It was a hoax, see?</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",
