As the other commenter mentioned, I don't think we're at CMC levels right now considering that was like full on MAD nuclear war right on the dial. Kennedy put the odds of a full exchange at 33-50%. Don't think this is more worrisome (yet). Second, I see a lot of people very casually bandying about the idea that Putin has \"incentive\" to use a nuclear weapon, but rarely is such a mention ever tied to an actual discussion of the practical value of a nuclear strike/what the incentive actually is. If the Russian army does collapse, it's hard for me to see how a nuclear strike is going to make it collapse less? In general, I'm just very doubtful of these kind of risk management takes on nuclear war. Being a nuclear war risk analyst seems like a relatively silly thing, as rude as that sounds. With such a vast range of intangibles and unknowables and very little evidence to boot, it seems more like medieval soothsayer stuff than an actual scientific approach. That said, agree with the conclusion he makes, which seems to line up with most everybody else. Nuclear war is unlikely but thinkable.",

I don&#39;t have an answer of course, it&#39;s just an interesting lens on trying to prevent propaganda-only bombardment.</p>\n</div>",

            "body": "AFAIK the war in Yemen, for the moment, has simmered down. But the truce is delicate and may well not last if either the government or the rebel groups feel like they have an advantage. So tomorrow Saudi Arabia probably wouldn\u2019t need a big arms restock, but it might soon. \n\nRegarding the domestic angle it seems to me to be an odd crisis. Oil hasn\u2019t spiked like it did in the summer, the low last month was ~$85. Today it seems to have spiked to $98 and then come back down, the longterm trend seems to suggest stability within the mid $90s bracket. Anecdotally my local gas jumped .40$ to 3.99$ and then on Saturday one of the stations cut to 3.89$ and everyone else has now done the same. It was $5.10 during the worst of the summer. All this is to say that the cut in production has yet to be felt in the market, and my understanding is the the market is currently still priced with the assumption that oil will remain under $100/bbl for the short term. Not good, not bad. The OPEC cuts make more sense if you look at them as a readjustment in target numbers.  There [seems to be](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-10-09/opec-oil-cut-is-mostly-illusion-as-saudis-face-kazakh-crude-return?leadSource=uverify%20wall) serious [pushback](https://www.wsj.com/articles/iraq-cant-afford-opec-mandated-oil-production-cut-senior-leader-says-11665427347) against the cut from OPEC countries, as well as the broader [investment community](https://www.afr.com/chanticleer/why-investors-should-hate-opec-s-oil-production-cut-20221006-p5bnms) who see this as a serious obstacle to cutting the global inflation issue. Probably it would lead to further interest rate rises which would increase the likelihood of a global recession. Which would ironically *hurt* oil consumption and thus prices & profit. Moreover even if the full cuts were realized, they may only amount to 900k bbl or less than 50% of the target. And of course Russian oil is also an issue. Cant find a reliable price, but it seems to be selling at about a $20/bbl discount over Brent. Maybe more? For Europe this is no solace, but in India and China Russian oil is very attractive right now. And as the Middle Eastern price goes up, the Ural discount will look better and better. If you\u2019re trying to sell to Asia that\u2019s a crisis, Saudi diplomacy for years has been battling Russian oil. This war has been a gift, but playing with prices risks snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. At $60/bbl Russian oil flirts with unprofitable. At $80/bbl Saudi oil is pretty attractive. At $80/100 the reverse is true. Overall, if you have a bearish outlook on the economy or a bullish outlook on the war you would want to *sell* oil rather now at the current price then Jack it up and wreck a good thing. \n\nSo what\u2019s going on? I think the whole crisis is just political dog fight. We know MBS and Biden don\u2019t like each other, and the current relationship should be described as \u2018frosty\u2019. Biden, however, swallowed his pride and over the summer went to Saudi Arabia and kissed the ring. A very powerful symbol. And the fist bump to close it out. He took a *lot* of heat for that from both sides of the political aisle (despite, in my opinion, doing the right thing to swallow his pride and put on a good show for the sake of the economy) With this whole crisis now, instead of looking like a leader Saudi Arabia has made Biden look weak. He went and kissed the ring and got nothing for it. Not only that, but MBS humiliated him in an important election season no less. A jump in gas prices and a bad press cycle is certainly not what Biden was hoping for this close to voting. And so, because MBS made a political show to humiliate Biden now Democrats want to make a political show of punishing the Saudis for it. It\u2019s jockeying for position. \n\nThe real question is if the Biden administration is really interested in sinking down to MBS\u2019s level or not. I suspect they won\u2019t. Public outrage but no action and private assurances might be enough to bring the Saudis around. \u201cLook you had your fun, but if you keep pushing us I won\u2019t be able to restrain my anti-Saudi wing. Play ball and we\u2019ll both be happy.\u201d Of course if MBS keeps trying to jerk the admin around, there could be real consequences when there *is* a crisis with Yemen. Complicating this all is the probability that one or both chambers of Congress will be Republican led and will probably remain pro-Saudi. They could really undermine the administration by letting the Saudis off the hook. It\u2019s a complicated situation all around.",
            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>AFAIK the war in Yemen, for the moment, has simmered down. But the truce is delicate and may well not last if either the government or the rebel groups feel like they have an advantage. So tomorrow Saudi Arabia probably wouldn\u2019t need a big arms restock, but it might soon. </p>\n\n<p>Regarding the domestic angle it seems to me to be an odd crisis. Oil hasn\u2019t spiked like it did in the summer, the low last month was ~$85. Today it seems to have spiked to $98 and then come back down, the longterm trend seems to suggest stability within the mid $90s bracket. Anecdotally my local gas jumped .40$ to 3.99$ and then on Saturday one of the stations cut to 3.89$ and everyone else has now done the same. It was $5.10 during the worst of the summer. All this is to say that the cut in production has yet to be felt in the market, and my understanding is the the market is currently still priced with the assumption that oil will remain under $100/bbl for the short term. Not good, not bad. The OPEC cuts make more sense if you look at them as a readjustment in target numbers.

The rhetoric around infrastructure strikes very much reminds me of \"the best troops haven't been committed\" comments. \n\n2.

I think this is an expensive waste of Russian equipment for a domestic audience at cost of war goals. </p>\n\n<p>While critical infrastructures may change the equation, I&#39;m dubious that this is actually big. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Russia has been plenty of times brutal, but hasn&#39;t gone after this before, why wait unless it&#39;s not that important? I really don&#39;t think Russia has simply ignored a strong conventional option when they haven&#39;t exactly held back elsewhere. The rhetoric around infrastructure strikes very much reminds me of &quot;the best troops haven&#39;t been committed&quot; comments. </p></li>\n<li><p>Ukraine has had months to prep, I&#39;m sure that they are ready for infrastructure attacks.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The math will change when the results become more apparent but my initial impression is to consider the attacks ineffective, and just a pure waste of crucial remaining cruise missiles resources.</p>\n</div>",

[As for Shahed here's one downed by small arms fire, they are just not very hard targets.](https://twitter.com/UAWeapons/status/1573335570390351872) If there's a kernel of truth maybe tail aspect only early Strela with dated seeker has real problem, even then the engine it uses to carry the warhead is many times more powerful than Orlan-30 at 50hp, I think this is where you can see the contradiction in the claims you presented. UK provided laser beam rider missiles apparent wouldn't care either way and they belong to the lower cost category.\n\n> MANPADs take down Orlans in certain conditions, but there is no evidence laser weapons can.\n\nI do want to hear about claims on Orlan's thermal protection measures. How it would survive a relatively small form factor 20kW LOCUST for example for more than a few seconds, especially the optics. For reference 12.7mm bullet has less than 20kJ muzzle energy.\n\n> The jammer and microwave weapons only seem to be effective against hobby drones\n\nRefer to the \"captured\" UAV section of Oryx's tally, including the Mohajer-6 recovered from water largely intact. How they are \"militarized\" beyond \"hobbyist drone\" with 100% COTS electronics mostly from the west is beyond me.

Only the bonafide SAM systems have been hitting it. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Then you tell US army what they should do with M-SHORAD apparently they&#39;re don&#39;t realize that, and prox fuzed Stinger. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UAWeapons/status/1573335570390351872\">As for Shahed here&#39;s one downed by small arms fire, they are just not very hard targets.</a> If there&#39;s a kernel of truth maybe tail aspect only early Strela with dated seeker has real problem, even then the engine it uses to carry the warhead is many times more powerful than Orlan-30 at 50hp, I think this is where you can see the contradiction in the claims you presented. UK provided laser beam rider missiles apparent wouldn&#39;t care either way and they belong to the lower cost category.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>MANPADs take down Orlans in certain conditions, but there is no evidence laser weapons can.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I do want to hear about claims on Orlan&#39;s thermal protection measures. How it would survive a relatively small form factor 20kW LOCUST for example for more than a few seconds, especially the optics. For reference 12.7mm bullet has less than 20kJ muzzle energy.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The jammer and microwave weapons only seem to be effective against hobby drones</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Refer to the &quot;captured&quot; UAV section of Oryx&#39;s tally, including the Mohajer-6 recovered from water largely intact. How they are &quot;militarized&quot; beyond &quot;hobbyist drone&quot; with 100% COTS electronics mostly from the west is beyond me. Even more so how the EW measures to take them down is somehow not known in the west.</p>\n</div>",

I can imagine some mindless Russian MoD official pressuring a VVS general to find *something* that the strategic air forces can contribute to the war effort as their modern PGM stocks decline, and then the only option the VVS could come up with was lobbing obsolete cruise missiles generally in the direction of civilians far behind the lines.\n\nThen again, you could ask the same question about their use of artillery.

Just making an educated guess, the reasons for those big misses could include poor manufacturing quality control and improper storage/maintenance of older weapon stocks.

Or, saying the same thing differently, 50% of rounds are expected to miss a target by more than the CEP.</p>\n\n<p>So it&#39;s possible for a PGM to have a CEP that&#39;s correctly stated to be tens of meters and for a non-trivial percentage of those missiles to miss targets by hundreds of meters. Just making an educated guess, the reasons for those big misses could include poor manufacturing quality control and improper storage/maintenance of older weapon stocks. Neither would be surprising based on what we&#39;ve seen of overall Russian military performance in this war.</p>\n</div>",

If you sanction now, what happens in a few months when there are new provocations, fewer options, and your side is in a worse position?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are a lot of sanctions that haven&#39;t been enacted by the West. They&#39;ve slowly ramped up sanctions over the past 8 months and will likely continue to do so so long as Russia continues to escalate</p>\n</div>",

As soon as Ukraine started becoming more strong he freaked out that it would be past the point of no return where they could never be reconquered.

        "body": "Are we allowed to speculate about the Kerch bridge explosion being a Russian false flag attack?\n\nI previously thought a false flag to be conspitorial thinking myself, but today I noticed two things which do seem to make it a bit more plausible: \n\n1) Putin's speech today and Russian media coverage of the air strikes on Kiev hinge completely on this \"terrorist attack\". They now make the war look like an \"anti-terrorist operation\". This is a big shift in their propaganda strategy.
