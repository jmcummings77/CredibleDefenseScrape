As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

The Mainstay radar should be able to detect incoming AA missiles at more than sufficient range to enable such maneuvers. Even assuming the Ukrainians got lucky and managed to shoot down not only one but two grossly negligent A-50 crews, the recent spate of Su-34 and Su-35 kills under similar circumstances suggest something else is happening, because fighter jets would certainly have the energy and maneuverability advantages required to dodge an S-300 or even a MIM-104 at such extreme ranges.\n\nSome people in this thread have mentioned the FrankenSAM program, or the possibility that NATO is providing general target location information and the Ukrainians are launching without a lock and relying on the missile's terminal guidance sensors to lead it into the target once it's close enough. Neither possibility addresses the physical limitations of the missile's energy profile. Figuring out the general area where an A-50 is flying is not that hard. On a clear day, partisans on the ground could provide that information. It's also very possible that separating the launcher from the radar components allows the Ukrainians to take greater risks forward deploying the TEL without the more expensive radar components of the GBAD complex. But that still doesn't eliminate the energy disadvantage resulting from launching at such extreme range.\n\nFor a while now, I've been wondering why the Ukrainians haven't figured out how to strap a MANPADs to one of their long range drones. If those drones are able to penetrate the airspace around Petersburg and Moscow to strike high value targets like oil refineries and *the Kremlin*, then they can probably penetrate the degraded AD coverage over the land bridge, a possibility which the recent frequent strikes on Crimea confirm. Sneaking a drone like that far enough behind the lines where it can take a pot shot at a Russian aircraft whose crew have their guard down would explain much of the recent Ukrainian AD success.\n\nEdit: oh, and given that many of the recent AD kills have been over or near the Sea of Azov, it would not surprise me to learn that the operation is actually just like two guys in a fishing boat cruising around with a pile of Stingers.

                    "body": "> Would stingers have the range to take down aircraft launching glide bombs and AWACS?\n\nThis is a tautological answer to some degree, but yes, if they were close enough. Stingers can hit targets flying at up to around 6000 meters Above Ground Level (AGL) when fired from the ground. Most fast jets and AWACS will operate higher than that under normal circumstances, although in Ukraine both the Russians and Ukrainians have generally been forced to operate at low altitudes because of the other side's GBAD, with the Russians sometimes able to operate fast movers at medium altitudes (3-6km AGL) near the front to launch glide bombs.\n\nThat puts them out of MANPADS range, but exposes them to greater risk from ground-based integrated air defense systems, which can detect aircraft at higher altitudes at greater distances over the ground because of the curvature of the earth. AWACS in general will operate at high altitude for similar line of sight reasons. So in the ordinary course of events, you would not expect someone to be able to target either a multirole fighter cruising toward or away from a bombing run or an AWACS with a MANPADS.\n\nBut if the targeted aircraft were flying relatively low, e.g. if the Mainstay was descending to RTB or the fighters were flying relatively low to avoid detection by Ukrainian ground-based radar, then someone on the ground with a Stinger or comparable MANPADS would be able to target the aircraft. It's possible that the Russians are flying their fighters low when well behind the lines because they believe there is no risk from MANPADS, but where there may be at least some risk from the Ukrainian ground-based, integrated air defense systems, at least in the more vulnerable higher altitude bands. Then, when they're on a bombing run, they pop up to medium altitude when approaching the lines so they are out of MANPADS range when launching bombs. After launch they would then rapidly descend as they turn away from the lines and get out of MANPADS range, reducing their exposure to longer range IADS like S-300 or PATRIOT batteries as they transit away from the combat zone. \n\nIt's also possible the MANPADS missile was air-launched from a drone, which may boost its operational ceiling by whatever altitude from which the drone launches the missile. e.g., if launched from 2km AGL, it might reach 8km AGL rather than the 6km achievable when launched from the ground (it may not be quite so linear because the flight characteristics at higher altitude won't map 1:1 to how the missile performs at lower altitude, but the performance will likely be roughly similar without major modifications to the missile design). It's not out of the realm of possibility that the Ukrainians have developed or acquired such a drone, given that the Turks are already producing a version of the Bayraktar that launches Stingers.\n\n> Which is part of what makes a PAC-2 ACTIVE upgrade (ie with an active radar seeker instead of SARH) attractive - would likely get you a ~20% range increase or so vs the current ~160km without modifying the booster at all \n\nI think we can infer that Ukraine has received active-radar homing PATRIOT variants from their success intercepting Russian ballistic missiles. Whether that's PAC-3s or the various upgraded PAC-2 variants. Which is why, as I mentioned in my original post above, people are suggesting the possibility that NATO provided general target location information and the Ukrainians lobbed a missile in the right general direction, relying on the missile's built-in terminal guidance to close on the target. Unless we're talking about something relatively exotic like the Israeli Python-5 missile, that CONOPs necessarily would require active radar homing, because any semi-active radar homing missile does not have any independent terminal guidance capable of functioning beyond the launching battery's radar range and insofar as I am aware there aren't any infrared homing missiles with the kind of range required here. \n\n> But if the missile is not the range limiting factor, \n\nWell, it is *a* limiting factor, meaning that this point was stated a little too strongly:\n\n> PAC-2 range is limited by MPQ-65 range, not the kinematics of the missile\n\nIt's true that the PAC-2 SARH variant range is limited by MPQ-65 range, and perhaps *more so* than by the kinematics of the missile, but it is also true that the physical capabilities of the missile still impose an independent range limitation that improved sensors alone cannot overcome. \n\nPATRIOT missiles are something like 5m long and weigh 900kg, compared to approximately 10m and a whopping *7100kg* for an S-200, some variants of which have or had ranges around 300km. Whereas the reported range on MIM-104s is approximately 160km. Most of the range difference can be attributed to the substantially larger fuel load on the S-200, not to guidance, because reported ranges are typically for optimal engagement scenarios. In an S-200's case, the optimal engagement would be against a very high altitude target that is thus reachable with SARH guided from the ground at such extreme range, so the limiting factor is the missile's physical ability to reach the target rather than the horizon imposed by the curvature of the earth on the statically positioned active radar. There simply aren't any cool engineering tricks that make the PATRIOT missile capable of significantly superior performance over an S-200 because missiles are actually physically relatively simple systems. You're not going to get a 1000% performance increase by tweaking aerodynamics or fuel mix or something like that, the physical size of the system imposes hard limits on its capabilities. Although the MIM-104 weighs an eighth of an S-200, the tyranny of the wagon equation means that its range will be better than 1/8th of the S-200s because the S-200 needs to carry extra fuel to be able to carry so much fuel, thus reducing the rate at which range increases in proportion to added fuel load. I could write out the math here but I'm lazy so I'll skip to the conclusion and say that reaching 2/3rds the range of the S-200 would be a remarkable engineering achievement, so a 200km ceiling on its estimated range would be generous. That is not dramatically greater than the publicly acknowledged 160km range, especially given that the *minimum* engagement range we are discussing is 170km, and a more probable launch site for a SAM (the 173km I posted above was measured from a very active part of the front where Russian ISR would be much more likely to pick up on a high value target like a SAM battery TEL) and/or a marginally more distant flight path for the A-50 would easily put the engagement range near or above 200km. Bottom line, the missile would still be operating at the upper boundary permitted by its energy profile, maximizing the warning time for the A-50 to evade and minimizing the energy available for terminal guidance.",

This type of operation has been repeated all across the post-Soviet sphere expressly to establish US influence in the absence of widespread popular support - hence the origin of the phrase \"color revolution\" in Russian propaganda narratives.    \n\nFor example in Ukraine the decision to include joining NATO as an express goal of Ukraine's foreign policy was done by Poroshenko in 2019 as last ditch effort to help his re-election, at the time when less than 50% of Ukrainians were in favour of joining NATO. So there clearly was a group of politicians who pushed Ukraine toward conflict despite not having popular support for their decisions. That's the meaning of \"color revolution\". It's not just Russian propaganda. There's a very unpleasant grain of truth in it. Quite a lot of truth in fact. Russia is quite adept at using western, and especially American, hypocrisy to its advantage and since outside of the western cultural sphere, like in the \"global South\",  American propaganda doesn't have so much effect the perception of countries such as Georgia or Ukraine is different. They are not viewed as democracies struggling against Russian authoritarianism and aggression but as corrupt and willful allies of Washington establishment expanding American influence for the benefit of American big business.\n\nSakashvily who won in 2004 with almost 100% support barely won over 50% in 2008 due to his blatant corruption and mishandling of power. Then he pushed for membership in NATO during the Bucharest summit (together with Ukraine, which Ukraine criticised because unlike Georgia they did not have territorial disputes on their territory at the time) and later disastrously reacted to Russian provocation in South Ossetia which provided justification for Russia's military intervention. \n\nOne of the main lessons from Sakashvily's disastrous leadership was Zelensky's order to Ukrainian units in the ATO zone in Donbas to, under no circumstance, open fire no matter what the separatist forces do after Russia recognised the republics on 22 February. The consequence was similar but the optics weren't.  Although it doesn't stop Georgians from lying about 2008 anyway.\n\n----\n\nSecondly since the 2012 parliamentary and 2013 presidential election Georgia is ruled by a pro-Russian faction which in 2017 made a change in constitution removing the direct election of the president from 2024 and replacing it with an indirect ballot by an electoral college consisting of members of parliament, including those in separatist republic of Abkhazia. It's deliberately made this way to ensure that the current governing party stays in power and protects it from popular support swings, especially those caused by war.\n\nHowever current polls still give the pro-Russian Georgian Dream a clear advantage over Sakashviliy's party which is backed by only about 20% of voters.  They will likely win even without manipulation of the election, which is likely.  If you look up Georgia's rankings of press freedom, democracy and corruption - they are not that far away from Armenia.\n \nNeither Georgia nor Armenia are the \"good guys\". Neither are genuinely democratic. Neither are valuable additions to western society. They are only useful for dirty geopolitics and fomenting conflict in the Caucasus. But most people in the west don't know it and believe the lies of anti-Russian regimes which are just as corrupt and harmful to their countries as the pro-Russian ones with one exception - the stolen money goes into the pockets of American and western oligarchs, not Russian ones.",

Which of these options is more likely than somebody screwed up? This is of course assuming that that location is correct. If it\u2019s closer to the front lines and within the plausible range of PAC 2/3 or S 300 then that absolutely becomes the most plausible scenario.</p>\n</div>",

I would say that at least 9 out of 10 times, then the missiles or drones are shot down before they reach Kyiv or it was a false alarm and they didn't target Kyiv.\n\n\nPeople take it pretty easy during the air alarms. All the shops will close, but you will still see quite a lot of people on the streets.\n\n\nThe big attacks always accures during the night. I'm only going to a shelter once I know it's the real deal.

Not to mention they detonate right on the water line.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes, but the main failure point in Houthi attacks so far is hitting the target in the first place. A surface drone addresses the instances where they do hit but fail to cause serious damage, but if anythihg is harder to hit a vessel with at all.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>You could also think that the U.S. navy has just performed well -and better than the Russians -at shooting down drones and missiles. Definitely can be and probably is a mixture of both.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Absolutely. Iranian weapons are worse than Ukrainian ones, and American warships are far better operated and designed than Russian ones.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I honestly see this as the next likely escalation as well, and I think it will happen this year.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I\u2019m surprised it hasn\u2019t happened already. To the Houthis, their attacks are only tenable as long as they fail. If they ever got their wish of shutting down the Red Sea, they\u2019d starve.</p>\n</div>",

It's difficult to fathom how Russia cannot just build some relatively cheap concrete and steel shelters, weather proof them, cover them in soil just like the Soviets did and call it a day.

The problem is this conclusion is normally born by excluding the context that Iraqi air defenses were largely suppressed and Coalition air forces could stroll right up to the shelters and drop 2000lb laser guided penetrating bombs directly on top of them.\n\nForcing your enemy to pay an increasingly higher price in terms of material committed, time taken and general cost of eliminating aircraft on a per airframe basis is a good thing and hardened shelters are a perfect example of this principle.

Airbase upgrades are not glamourous nor are they particularly high budget, Russia very infrequently upgrades its airbases, normally exclusively for runway restorations and even then only a decade or more after it ideally should have been restored. I don't know how money is divided, but I suspect airbase upgrades of that type are widely approved in principle at the extreme upper levels, but then there is a disconnect when it comes time to actually allocate funding on a per base level for these works.

These are also just the bases I know of that were officially closed, there are many more bases that were converted to helicopter use, ARZ (aircraft repair) bases, training regiments or civilian use where the hardened shelters are also no longer used to house aircraft and are largely abandoned. This 600 shelter reduction is a minimal floor, the number is likely much higher, especially if endless satellite imagery of hundreds/thousands of Russian aircraft rotting on Aprons gives any indication.\n\nIt's worth noting that some of the older shelters from the early and late 60s struggle to fit modern fighters, able to only hold the smaller MiG-29, although these are a minimal number of the total number of ex-Soviet HAS. The majority of their hardened shelters were built for MiG25's/31's and Su-24's which can fit Su-27's, albeit with little room to spare in some.\n\nThe difficulty with these airbases is that they were paid for when money was not really an object, but as they got older and their facilities required vast modernizations and replacement, it was deemed cheaper to abandon them altogether and move remaining assets to smaller and more easily serviceable (proximity to larger cities and infrastructure) airbases. This was preferable given whilst the Russian air force is still large, it is still in a consolidation phase.\n\nEven before the fall of the Soviet Union the Airforce had nowhere near enough covered shelters, relying mostly on revetments and apron parking for the majority of its fleet with the shelters reserved for its strategic interceptors and strategic bomber fleets, with the further consolidation of air groups and closure of bases in the 90s and early 2000s it further exacerbated the problem.\n\nAnother difficulty with soviet hardened shelters is that they are all rapidly approaching end of life, which is another cost calculation in the closure of airbases. They'll likely still be around for decades to come, but not in the sense that you'd trust putting a potentially $100M+ aircraft inside. Many of these hardened shelters have water and flooding issues, not to mention old concrete and steel that was poorly maintained in the 90s and early 2000s.\n\nRussia also still have a relatively huge number of active aircraft, building hardened shelters for all of them would be expensive and in their eyes, not strictly necessary although this calculation may change now that the proliferation of long range drone capabilities have become evident and the VKS is getting a massive influx of material and cash.\n\nTo be clear it's still an endeavour they should undertake in my opinion, too often Russian aircraft and material is left outside of shelter for decades at a time, mostly because there simply isn't a shelter for them to occupy.",

There is still ammo in it obviously, but giving it all to Ukraine isn't just dangerous, its essentially suicide since there will be NOBODY who bails out the US if it gets into a war and doesn't have enough.\n\nUS monthly output for artillery production started the war at \\~12k/mo and is now supposedly at \\~30k/mo, which is still nowhere near what it hopes to ramp up to by 2025, which is 100k/mo or more. That plus EU ramp up is what is hoped to provide Ukraine with the monthly output of artillery necessary to have a qualitative and quantitative fires parity or even potentially superiority against the Russians.\n\nIn the mean time, since the US can't actually provide the artillery demands of Ukraine itself, the way it was chiefly relying on in 2023 (minus DPICM) is what [the Czechs are trying to do now](https://www.politico.eu/article/czech-republic-artillery-weapons-ukraine-european-union/), find existing global stockpiles of the correct caliber from nations who are willing to either give them to Ukraine, or more likely to sell them to Ukrainian Allies for them to give to Ukraine.\n\nAnd that is where the Congressional budget can help with.

But ultimately they were on a timeline, not only about having enough manpower, equipment, and supplies, but specifically the weather and Russian reserves showing up. When they hit their rough culminating point around Oct 10 that was no doubt exacerbated by the arrival of the  mud season and Russian reinforcements, who bought time to dig in with the tenacious defense of the Lyman area (say what you will about them normally, but that was the exact right time for a \"hold at all costs\" positional defense order). \n\nWith more forces immediately ready for the Kharkiv counteroffensive, I think they might have taken Kremmina, it was already pretty close as it was. If they took that, they might have done as you say and been able to start the historical turning movement to outflank the Donbas, though I doubt they could have pulled it off totally. They only had the ability to punch through from the north, and to get around Severodonetsk to the coast is 200 kilometers of the coast as the crow flies, they didn't have enough units in the entire UAF to pull off a one axis drive of that length, especially not enough that were truly offensive capable, or a logistical system to support them moving that far and fast. And yet, with more forces they probably could have caused the retreat of Russian forces in the Siversk salient and maybe east of Bakhmut too. But to achieve more that would require them to be psychic. \n\nIn July-August when the Zaluzhny was planning their September 2022 Counteroffensivehe envisioned it to be against the South, with one operational axis against Melitopol to cut the Land Bridge and another against the Kherson Bridgehead on the western bank of the Dnieper. Together they were supposed to do the exact same thing the 2023 counteroffensive was supposed to do, get close enough to Crimea to seriously threaten it, as pressure against Putin to end the war. \n\nBut the scope of Zaluzhny's plan was too big, way too unlikely to succeed especially after the Russians reinforced both areas after Zelensky and others made it clear where the UAF were going to attack (another thing they copied in 2023). So Zaluzhny scrubbed the Melitopol axis thrust, and made the Kherson Bridgehead operation their strategic main effort. But that left Zaluzhny rightfully wanting a major secondary supporting effort to get the Russian attention somewhere else, to fix them in place and force them to deploy strategic reserves. Someone pitched Kharkiv (Syrsky apparently got the credit for the idea and executing it), Zaluzhny agreed.\n\nHowever long they truly spent prepping for the Kherson Bridgehead operation, it seems they threw together the Kharkiv counteroffensive in weeks. All the units involved in the assault had been fighting in the East for at least one month, some since the war started. Jomini of the West (a very reputable OSINT analyst who stopped posting regularly in late 2022) had previously marked all of the five assault brigades as having no better than 55-74% strength in terms of readiness, with one of them being rated the previous month as 50-54% strength. Some veterans of the battle later said they were pulled to the rear 1-2 weeks out, given replacement troops, some new equipment, given time to do maintenance and prepare, with a minimum of one M777 battery aded to each brigade's artillery group to give them the ability to fire GPD guided Excalibur, etc. It was a very highly planned operation, very much done according to the solid aspects of old Soviet doctrine. But there were limits to what the assault five designated brigades could accomplish. \n\nWhile other brigades were also committed to the attack during the offensive, especially at Lyman, few came from the strategic reserve, they too were already pretty exhausted, plus most had zero experience in training or combat conducting any sort of offensive operations. \n\nWhen it comes to fresher UAF units, who might have been legitimately offensive capable (most weren't), those were either committed to the Kherson Bridgehead operation or else had already been committed to defend the new defensive lines east of Siversk and Bakhmut, with many of the units defending Bakhmut were already battered enough to require a number of brigades to be rotated out that fall.",
