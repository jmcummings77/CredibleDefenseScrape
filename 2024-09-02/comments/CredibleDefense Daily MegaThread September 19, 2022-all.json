The advantage of the gas turbine, versus a piston scheme, is that when the air and fuel are mixed and compressed you can use almost any kind of petroleum from home heating oil to JP8.

Like this:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ArtisanalAPT/status/1566141350910824448\n\nThis is what they're targeting:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GvanWinssen/status/1566198163224121347\n\nSo, the theory that was circulating a while back was that the Russians stacked up 9 railway carriages over the water (sounds totally structurally fine), and then plan on filling it up with the dirt and gravel. That seems way more vulnerable to the HIMARS than what was there previously. \n\nMore importantly, two other factors:\n\n1.The north side of the bridge is open, deeper and just concrete road surface.

I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll succeed, but that\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to do,\u201d</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

They are clearly willing to endure massive losses if it means the potential for victory, but I'm skeptical Russia has the same fortitude. Ukraine has fully mobilized its population for this war, Russia is still half-assing it. Second, part of the major issues Russia is now facing is that it's strategic position in Ukraine is, let's say, suboptimal.

There should be a clear and distinctive lexical difference between those and units which are functionally engaging in combat. </p>\n\n<p>I think early war there were a lot of armchair enthusiasts and maybe even vets who were <strong>way</strong> too eager to declare the war over (or at least, major combat operations) because they saw 20-30% loss figures and assumed based on western doctrine that these units were not <em>capable</em> of being used in combat, because NATO forces would not do that. But this was obviously incorrect. They were combat capable and were used in combat, and that shocked a lot of people who thought Russia couldn&#39;t possibly mount another offensive in June. All of the talk about a quick russian collapse vanished because people could not manage their expectations properly.</p>\n</div>",

The more I think of your Vietnam comparison the more interesting I think it actually is. You\u2019re right that the majority of weapons weren\u2019t made in country, so attacks on infrastructure did little to stop the flow of weapons South. BUT! North Vietnam did base much of its legitimacy on industrializing the country. Factory and dam building were big facets of this strategy.

Partly this is why the Xmas raids were so effective, no one wanted to see a return to the general air offensive of the 1960s. But it also highlights that without constant suppression and clear goals, bombing and strikes can\u2019t permanently end industry nor produce a new military outcome. Anyway I\u2019m terms of Ukraine, economic destabilization may be a goal. Knock out enough civilian infrastructure to destroy GDP, make Ukraine more dependent on outside aid, make it more burdensome to carry on the war.

Brussels is demanding both sides normalize ties if they want to join the bloc, but the Serbian leader has refused to budge.\n\n>Last week, he met with Balkan envoys representing the EU, France and Germany as part of the diplomatic efforts. He said he turned down a proposal for a deal that would enable Kosovo join the UN.\n\n>The intensifying pressure for Serbia to change its stance is complicating the country\u2019s position regarding energy security -- for which it depends largely on Russian gas exporter Gazprom -- and procuring food and other imports, Vucic said. \n\n>He has instead looked elsewhere for economic support, arranging a $1 billion bilateral loan from the United Arab Emirates last week and exploring a possible deal with the IMF to bolster Serbia\u2019s finances.\n\n>Rejecting proposals from the EU, which is by far Serbia\u2019s biggest trading partner, \u201ccomes at a price,\u201d he said.\n\n>\u201cBig and fierce pressures will continue,\u201d Vucic said. \u201cWe have to take care how we\u2019re going to live.\u201d\n\n\nTo extend the conversation from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/xhet1e/credibledefense_daily_megathread_september_18_2022/ip178ne/) yesterday.",

Americans can train them, Americans can perform complex overhaul as long they can pull Abrams west of their border, there are many Americans with such knowledge, and a lot of Abrams starting with the ones Marine retired from their service relative recently. They will inevitably operate a mixed fleet for the remainder of the war and beyond but there&#39;s a lot better resource to help them use a western tank, captured T-72B3 don&#39;t come with after sales services.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "Both the DPR and LPR announced today that they would like to hold a referendum on officially joining Russia. This is one to watch for, for it goes forward, then the Donbass becomes 'Russian', and therefore Russian military strategy may change. \n\nThe change may not be important or it may be a huge shift--we don't know how it would play out until it does. One possibility: perhaps this is a way of selling to the Russian people that this is a war over the defense of core Russian territory (nevermind the fact the Donbass has been in Ukraine since Ukraine's founding--its an ex post facto justification). Russia would then be able to use Ukrainian soldiers in the DPR and LPR as evidence of an 'invasion of Russia,' and likely gin up support for mobilization or some other escalatory move (nuclear weapons, I think, are further up the ladder and will not be deployed--yet).\n\nThis of course should be prefaced with a huge caveat that Putin may reject both applications. I don't doubt that the referendums would pass, with or without vote rigging (if there's been any mass anti-Russian sentiment amongst the civilian population in the DPR/LPR, I have not seen it), but annexing Ukrainian territory would be a massive escalation. For the most part, Putin's avoided doing the most escalatory things that were on the table (annexing territory, terror bombing civilian centers, using WMDs, and mobilizing the Russian army). But his army is losing. He's lost his first gamble (rapid strike on Kyiv). He lost his second gamble (attrition warfare with mass artillery & wait for Europe to freeze--manpower deficits mean Russia can't maintain a cohesive line of defense; EU may still be in a tough position, but hedging everything on one winter of pain is not a winning strategy). Time then for a third gamble?\n\nI do think Putin will double down on Ukraine before he pulls out. Beyond the military, if he does officially annex Ukrainian territory, that I think will open a possible diplomatic front that the US should exploit. In Africa and Asia, most countries have been cool to the idea of sanctions against Russia. This is because for many of them, Russia (USSR, really) has been a historic friend to them, and given that, they have a less than savory view of the US (some have very valid reasons for disliking us--coups and massacres tend to have that effect). But if the US can show that Putin is conquering territory, territory that absolutely not Russian and has not been Russian since the Tsar's empire, that I think may wedge some supporters towards the US side (that, and monetary incentives).\n\nIt also entails a discussion on what NATO's own strategic goals in this war. To a large extent, we have been supporting Ukraine's return to a status quo of Feb 23, 2022--a status quo of a nation locked in near-frozen civil war. If Russia annexes the Donbass, do we change our war aims to the liberation of Crimea and the Donbass, to match Ukraine's own goals? That would be a heavy lift for Ukraine alone, without further air and naval support. Support which NATO could offer, but which carries escalatory nuclear risk. But if Russia goes off conquering territory beyond Crimea, then I think we have a very serious conversation about Russian expansionism. \n\nIf they're using ancient de jure Russian Empire borders to justify annexing the Donbass, then their true war aims might entail conquering not just Ukraine, not just the lands of the former USSR, but the Baltics, Poland, and Manchuria at the least. And never forget that Istanbul in the Tsarist eyes was always destined to be Tsargrad. Not that Russia is capable of any of this today.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Both the DPR and LPR announced today that they would like to hold a referendum on officially joining Russia. This is one to watch for, for it goes forward, then the Donbass becomes &#39;Russian&#39;, and therefore Russian military strategy may change. </p>\n\n<p>The change may not be important or it may be a huge shift--we don&#39;t know how it would play out until it does. One possibility: perhaps this is a way of selling to the Russian people that this is a war over the defense of core Russian territory (nevermind the fact the Donbass has been in Ukraine since Ukraine&#39;s founding--its an ex post facto justification). Russia would then be able to use Ukrainian soldiers in the DPR and LPR as evidence of an &#39;invasion of Russia,&#39; and likely gin up support for mobilization or some other escalatory move (nuclear weapons, I think, are further up the ladder and will not be deployed--yet).</p>\n\n<p>This of course should be prefaced with a huge caveat that Putin may reject both applications. I don&#39;t doubt that the referendums would pass, with or without vote rigging (if there&#39;s been any mass anti-Russian sentiment amongst the civilian population in the DPR/LPR, I have not seen it), but annexing Ukrainian territory would be a massive escalation. For the most part, Putin&#39;s avoided doing the most escalatory things that were on the table (annexing territory, terror bombing civilian centers, using WMDs, and mobilizing the Russian army). But his army is losing. He&#39;s lost his first gamble (rapid strike on Kyiv). He lost his second gamble (attrition warfare with mass artillery &amp; wait for Europe to freeze--manpower deficits mean Russia can&#39;t maintain a cohesive line of defense; EU may still be in a tough position, but hedging everything on one winter of pain is not a winning strategy). Time then for a third gamble?</p>\n\n<p>I do think Putin will double down on Ukraine before he pulls out. Beyond the military, if he does officially annex Ukrainian territory, that I think will open a possible diplomatic front that the US should exploit. In Africa and Asia, most countries have been cool to the idea of sanctions against Russia. This is because for many of them, Russia (USSR, really) has been a historic friend to them, and given that, they have a less than savory view of the US (some have very valid reasons for disliking us--coups and massacres tend to have that effect). But if the US can show that Putin is conquering territory, territory that absolutely not Russian and has not been Russian since the Tsar&#39;s empire, that I think may wedge some supporters towards the US side (that, and monetary incentives).</p>\n\n<p>It also entails a discussion on what NATO&#39;s own strategic goals in this war. To a large extent, we have been supporting Ukraine&#39;s return to a status quo of Feb 23, 2022--a status quo of a nation locked in near-frozen civil war. If Russia annexes the Donbass, do we change our war aims to the liberation of Crimea and the Donbass, to match Ukraine&#39;s own goals? That would be a heavy lift for Ukraine alone, without further air and naval support. Support which NATO could offer, but which carries escalatory nuclear risk. But if Russia goes off conquering territory beyond Crimea, then I think we have a very serious conversation about Russian expansionism. </p>\n\n<p>If they&#39;re using ancient de jure Russian Empire borders to justify annexing the Donbass, then their true war aims might entail conquering not just Ukraine, not just the lands of the former USSR, but the Baltics, Poland, and Manchuria at the least.

You\u2019ll almost certainly see their manpower levels crash in just months. This is always a dangerous time because the people you end up holding onto are not always the best, smartest, or most experienced. Then Kyiv will have to determine their security needs. Here the nature of the peace will be be very important. If another war with Russia seems likely, say if the conflict freezes, or if Russia retains significant post-Feb territories, the UA will have to maintain a larger more capable force. This would mean inducing, either with money or with threats, more of the wartime volunteers to stay on. A more peaceable settlement would allow for greater demobilization. Manpower is tricky, it\u2019s hard to keep vets in uniform if they don\u2019t want to be without an obvious crisis. Here the UA would want to work for stability and skill cadres. \n\nIn terms of equipment well probably see the UA divest itself (or at least reserve and mothball, again depending on the settlement) of legacy equipment and odd NATO gifts first. Old T-72 variants, those Slovakian T-55s, old ex soviet stock in other categories. These are easy cuts without losing forward capabilities. And then the UA will have to think long and hard about who it wants to buy from. Germany? The US? South Korea? Poland? Polish Korean? Regardless the mid and long term material strategy will be to convert to either domestic production or a secure non-Russian supplier for all military hardware. \n\nAgain all this depends on the settlement.

Not a full on invasion, but a Cuba-style blockade. \n\nHere's the full article, unpaywalled (apologies if this is verboten):\n\n\n> China\u2019s armed forces are capable of blockading Taiwan, a senior U.S. Navy official said, pointing to the size of the country\u2019s navy, which is the world\u2019s largest and growing at a rapid pace.\n\n> \u201cThey have a very large navy, and if they want to bully and put ships around Taiwan, they very much can do that,\u201d Vice Adm. Karl Thomas, commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.\n\n> China conducted military drills last month that sought to\u00a0[demonstrate its ability to blockade Taiwan](https://archive.ph/o/KxrK0/https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-military-launches-live-fire-exercises-around-taiwan-11659600560?mod=article_inline), a democratic, self-governing island it sees as part of its territory. The drills came in response to a\u00a0[visit by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi](https://archive.ph/o/KxrK0/https://www.wsj.com/articles/nancy-pelosi-heads-to-taipei-as-china-warns-of-disastrous-consequences-11659442605?mod=article_inline)\u00a0to the island in August and occurred in six zones that effectively encircled Taiwan. By using a blockade, military analysts say, Beijing could try to force submission by Taiwan\u2019s government without an invasion.\n\n> For decades, Washington\u00a0[has maintained a policy of strategic ambiguity](https://archive.ph/o/KxrK0/https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-undercuts-u-s-strategic-ambiguity-over-defending-taiwan-11653338453?mod=article_inline), not saying whether it would directly intervene in a conflict. Though the White House says that policy hasn\u2019t changed, President Biden has said that the U.S. would defend Taiwan if China tried to invade. In an interview that aired Sunday on CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d he reiterated his position, saying the\u00a0[U.S. military would get involved](https://archive.ph/o/KxrK0/https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-calls-pandemic-over-says-u-s-troops-could-defend-taiwan-11663554391?mod=article_inline)\u00a0if there was an unprecedented attack.\n\n> Speaking with the Journal before President Biden\u2019s interview aired, Adm. Thomas said he didn\u2019t know if China would carry out an invasion or a blockade, but it was his job to be ready for whatever they do. He said he hoped China would resolve differences over the island peacefully. If China were to mount a blockade, Adm. Thomas said the international community could step in.\n\n> \u201cClearly if they do something that\u2019s non-kinetic, which, you know, a blockade is less kinetic,\u201d he said, meaning it isn\u2019t an all-out attack involving lethal force, \u201cthen that allows the international community to weigh in and to work together on how we\u2019re going to solve that challenge.\u201d\n\n> Beijing strongly opposed Mrs. Pelosi\u2019s visit\u2014the highest-level U.S. trip to the island in 25 years\u2014and warned of unspecified countermeasures if she defied their warnings. Amid rising tensions, the U.S. military aircraft taking Mrs. Pelosi to Taiwan opted for an\u00a0[unusual, circuitous route](https://archive.ph/o/KxrK0/https://www.wsj.com/articles/nancy-pelosis-plane-took-a-three-hour-detour-to-get-to-taiwan-11659482515?mod=article_inline)\u00a0instead of flying over the South China Sea on a near-linear path.\n\n> Asked why the plane took a circuitous route, Adm. Thomas said the decision was made at \u201chigh levels\u201d because officials weren\u2019t sure how China was going to respond. \u201cThere certainly was a lot of rhetoric by the PRC about, if she goes, there will be some consequences,\u201d he said, referring to China by the acronym of its full name, the People\u2019s Republic of China. \u201cYou never quite know with the PRC if the rhetoric is real or if it\u2019s just that\u2014rhetoric\u2014and just to prevent any miscalculation, there were some decisions made to give us a little bit more time and space to understand what their reaction might be.\u201d\n\n> After the visit, China launched dayslong military exercises that included warplane and naval maneuvers, and it launched missiles over Taiwan\u2019s main island for what is believed to have been the first time. Adm. Thomas said the firing of missiles was irresponsible and that China had \u201cmoved the goal posts just a little bit more\u201d by doing so.\n\n> \u201cThere\u2019s a term in Mandarin\u2014can shi\u2014nibbling like a silkworm,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just kind of continue to push the boundaries, see what they can get away with.\u201d\n\n> China\u2019s Foreign Ministry didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. China has accused the U.S. of escalating tensions over Taiwan and said Mrs. Pelosi\u2019s visit could encourage the island\u2019s politicians to seek independence.\n\n> Adm. Thomas said he sees China\u2019s recent actions around Taiwan as an extension of the \u201cmight makes right\u201d mentality he said the country has shown in the way it has militarized the South China Sea. China\u2019s expansive claims in the South China Sea overlap with those of other countries in the region. It has during the past decade built artificial islands in those waters, equipping the outposts with military infrastructure and equipment.\n\n> \u201cThey\u2019ve completely militarized those islands,\u201d he said. \u201cThey already have all the bunkers they need, they already have all the fuel storage capacity they need, the ability to house troops, they have the missiles, the radars, the sensors.\u201d\n\n> China has the world\u2019s largest navy by size, though the U.S. has more-advanced warships, including a larger aircraft-carrier fleet, giving it a qualitative edge. Adm. Thomas said China is turning out navy ships at an impressive rate, while the U.S. doesn\u2019t have as many shipyards producing navy ships as it needs. China, for instance, is producing its Type 055 destroyers\u2014a large and heavily armed surface ship, also known as the Renhai-class cruiser, that has become a symbol of China\u2019s naval modernization\u2014at a much greater rate than the U.S. is producing guided-missile destroyers, he said.\n\n> \u201cCapacity has a quality all of its own,\u201d he said.\n\n> Difficulties China might have coordinating across different branches of its armed services, which is how modern militaries operate, has long been seen as a potential weakness for the country\u2019s military. But China has made progress on that front, Adm. Thomas said. Aircraft from China\u2019s air force are flying across water, whereas only its navy undertook such flights four years ago, he said.\n\n> \u201cThey are more joint than they were a year ago, three years ago, five years ago,\u201d he said.",

China has accused the U.S. of escalating tensions over Taiwan and said Mrs. Pelosi\u2019s visit could encourage the island\u2019s politicians to seek independence.</p>\n\n<p>Adm. Thomas said he sees China\u2019s recent actions around Taiwan as an extension of the \u201cmight makes right\u201d mentality he said the country has shown in the way it has militarized the South China Sea. China\u2019s expansive claims in the South China Sea overlap with those of other countries in the region. It has during the past decade built artificial islands in those waters, equipping the outposts with military infrastructure and equipment.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThey\u2019ve completely militarized those islands,\u201d he said. \u201cThey already have all the bunkers they need, they already have all the fuel storage capacity they need, the ability to house troops, they have the missiles, the radars, the sensors.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>China has the world\u2019s largest navy by size, though the U.S. has more-advanced warships, including a larger aircraft-carrier fleet, giving it a qualitative edge. Adm. Thomas said China is turning out navy ships at an impressive rate, while the U.S. doesn\u2019t have as many shipyards producing navy ships as it needs. China, for instance, is producing its Type 055 destroyers\u2014a large and heavily armed surface ship, also known as the Renhai-class cruiser, that has become a symbol of China\u2019s naval modernization\u2014at a much greater rate than the U.S. is producing guided-missile destroyers, he said.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cCapacity has a quality all of its own,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>Difficulties China might have coordinating across different branches of its armed services, which is how modern militaries operate, has long been seen as a potential weakness for the country\u2019s military. But China has made progress on that front, Adm. Thomas said. Aircraft from China\u2019s air force are flying across water, whereas only its navy undertook such flights four years ago, he said.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThey are more joint than they were a year ago, three years ago, five years ago,\u201d he said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

        "body": "Excellent new Kofman and Loukianova on Russian nuclear escalation\n\n[https://warontherocks.com/2022/09/escalation-management-and-nuclear-employment-in-russian-military-strategy-2/](https://warontherocks.com/2022/09/escalation-management-and-nuclear-employment-in-russian-military-strategy-2/)\n\n>The Russian military sees an independent conventional war as possible, but believes conflict is unlikely to remain conventional as it escalates. This is not a departure from late-Soviet military thought. The military expects a great-power war between nuclear peers to eventually involve nuclear weapons, and is comfortable with this reality, unlike U.S. strategists. However, in contrast with Soviet thinking, the Russian military does not believe that limited nuclear use necessarily leads to uncontrolled escalation. The Russian military believes that calibrated use of conventional and nuclear capability is not only possible but may have decisive deterrent effects  \n>  \n>...  \n>  \n>Russian military strategists see conventional weapons as usable and coercive early on in a conflict or crisis, and naturally they carry far fewer escalatory risks. They have taken over deterrence tasks **in the initial period of a regional war** from nonstrategic nuclear weapons, and lesser conflicts like local wars.  \n>  \n>However, Russia has no intention of replacing nuclear weapons with conventional capabilities across the board. **No number of precision-guided weapons will lead the Russian military to forgo nonstrategic nuclear weapons and the threat of nuclear employment in an escalating conflict.** The Russian military sees conventional and nuclear capabilities as complementary within its deterrence concepts, not as substitutions for one another.  \n>  \n>...  \n>  \n>Russia sees nuclear weapons as essential because their psychological impact, and deterrent effect, cannot be supplanted by conventional capabilities. They are an asymmetric investment to neutralize U.S. conventional advantages, representing a competitive strategy. Simply put, conventional weapons cannot match the deterrence bang for the ruble spent on nuclear weapons.  \n>  \n>...  \n>  \n>Moscow sees nuclear weapons as essential for deterrence and useful for nuclear warfighting in regional or large-scale war. That is hardly a recent development, though it may be new to decision-makers in the United States. **There is an erroneous perception in American policy circles that at some point Washington and Moscow were on the same page and shared a similar threshold for nuclear use in conflict.** It is not clear that this imagined time period ever existed, but perhaps both countries viewed nuclear escalation as uncontrollable, or at least publicly described it as such during the late-Cold War period. In principle, Russian leadership does view nuclear use as defensive, forced by exigent circumstances, and in the context of regional or large-scale conflicts.  \n>  \n>...  \n>  \n>Can Russia find itself fighting a war that it perceives to be defensive in nature, and then resort to nuclear first use as the conflict escalates? A**bsolutely, but this proposition assumes a host of military and nonmilitary actions taken on both sides prior to nuclear escalation, rather than an attempt at preemptive nuclear coercion.** There is no gimmicky \u201cescalate to win\u201d strategy, in which military strategists believe they can start and quickly end a conflict on their terms thanks to the wonders of nuclear weapons. The U.S. defense strategy community needs to put away this boogeyman and stop telling this scary tale like some kind of nuclear ghost story.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Excellent new Kofman and Loukianova on Russian nuclear escalation</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://warontherocks.com/2022/09/escalation-management-and-nuclear-employment-in-russian-military-strategy-2/\">https://warontherocks.com/2022/09/escalation-management-and-nuclear-employment-in-russian-military-strategy-2/</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Russian military sees an independent conventional war as possible, but believes conflict is unlikely to remain conventional as it escalates. This is not a departure from late-Soviet military thought. The military expects a great-power war between nuclear peers to eventually involve nuclear weapons, and is comfortable with this reality, unlike U.S. strategists. However, in contrast with Soviet thinking, the Russian military does not believe that limited nuclear use necessarily leads to uncontrolled escalation. The Russian military believes that calibrated use of conventional and nuclear capability is not only possible but may have decisive deterrent effects  </p>\n\n<p>...  </p>\n\n<p>Russian military strategists see conventional weapons as usable and coercive early on in a conflict or crisis, and naturally they carry far fewer escalatory risks. They have taken over deterrence tasks <strong>in the initial period of a regional war</strong> from nonstrategic nuclear weapons, and lesser conflicts like local wars.  </p>\n\n<p>However, Russia has no intention of replacing nuclear weapons with conventional capabilities across the board. <strong>No number of precision-guided weapons will lead the Russian military to forgo nonstrategic nuclear weapons and the threat of nuclear employment in an escalating conflict.</strong> The Russian military sees conventional and nuclear capabilities as complementary within its deterrence concepts, not as substitutions for one another.  </p>\n\n<p>...  </p>\n\n<p>Russia sees nuclear weapons as essential because their psychological impact, and deterrent effect, cannot be supplanted by conventional capabilities. They are an asymmetric investment to neutralize U.S. conventional advantages, representing a competitive strategy. Simply put, conventional weapons cannot match the deterrence bang for the ruble spent on nuclear weapons.  </p>\n\n<p>...  </p>\n\n<p>Moscow sees nuclear weapons as essential for deterrence and useful for nuclear warfighting in regional or large-scale war. That is hardly a recent development, though it may be new to decision-makers in the United States. <strong>There is an erroneous perception in American policy circles that at some point Washington and Moscow were on the same page and shared a similar threshold for nuclear use in conflict.</strong> It is not clear that this imagined time period ever existed, but perhaps both countries viewed nuclear escalation as uncontrollable, or at least publicly described it as such during the late-Cold War period. In principle, Russian leadership does view nuclear use as defensive, forced by exigent circumstances, and in the context of regional or large-scale conflicts.  </p>\n\n<p>...  </p>\n\n<p>Can Russia find itself fighting a war that it perceives to be defensive in nature, and then resort to nuclear first use as the conflict escalates? A<strong>bsolutely, but this proposition assumes a host of military and nonmilitary actions taken on both sides prior to nuclear escalation, rather than an attempt at preemptive nuclear coercion.</strong> There is no gimmicky \u201cescalate to win\u201d strategy, in which military strategists believe they can start and quickly end a conflict on their terms thanks to the wonders of nuclear weapons. The U.S. defense strategy community needs to put away this boogeyman and stop telling this scary tale like some kind of nuclear ghost story. The Russian military has a visibly different comfort level with nuclear weapons than the United States, and arguably always will, but it does not write of nuclear escalation in recklessly optimistic terms, incognizant of the associated risks.  </p>\n\n<p>...  </p>\n\n<p>Seeking to dissuade Russian planners by telling them their strategy won\u2019t work will only reinforce their belief that the United States is deeply concerned about Russian limited nuclear employment, and validate the thinking behind it. There is a general sense in U.S. military circles that it is dangerous for Russia to believe that nuclear escalation can be controlled. Yet by imagining that the United States can have conventional-only wars with nuclear powers, where the stakes for them are likely to become existential, <strong>there is an implicit assumption in U.S. defense strategy that Washington can somehow control escalation and dissuade nuclear use on the part of others, without any discernible plan for accomplishing this feat</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

It included some possible options like giving up on offensives entirely and trying to hold onto existing gains which Russia would retain after the eventual brokering of peace with Ukraine. The article deemed this to be non-viable, in part because Ukraine would not settle for a peace that includes the loss of territories, and in part because Russia is on trajectory for defeat and this wouldn't be enough to change that. The other option was mobilization, either partial or total, whether it's even possible is debatable given Russian equipment and officer shortages for one, but a bunch of men being forced to fight may simply not be enough to solve all of Russia's issues in Ukraine. Mobilization is of course also a risky endeavour, total commitment has to result in total victory or total defeat, and the regime isn't surviving a total defeat. The whole thing would also be a complete 180 of everything Putin's regime built itself on for decades, so again, it's questionable if it can even survive mobilization in general. In conclusion what seemed most likely is a mix of both, reducing Russian imperial ambitions without completely giving up on future offensives, combined with the so called shadow mobilization that would keep the machine going and also keep the existing narrative of a special operation in place even if it's obviously a rather troublesome operation.\n\nIf Russia gives up on offensives entirely and fully commits to consolidating their existing gains, it would likey still end up losing the war completely in the long term, in which case there's a very real risk of Putin's regime collapsing. Mobilization is another bag of problems, with the regime itself being put at risk just by the mere act of going forward with a full mobilization and if it somehow survives it and also manages to pull it off and put the numbers to use properly, then we could still see a total defeat in Ukraine as mobilization may simply not be enough which seems more and more likely each day as Ukraine gets stronger, this again could probably lead to the regime's collapse. If we go with the reduced territorial ambitions and shadow mobilization approach which is presented as the most likely option, personally I don't think that's enough to do more than save time either so we're still looking at Russia losing the war along with it's territories in Ukraine like it would if we went with the previous options, the regime would be again at great risk after such a loss. The timeframes at play would change but all these would probably lead to the same unaccaptable result.\n\nNone of these options seem appealing, they did little more than buy time until the regime's likely collapse which is in no way acceptable to the one at the head of it all who may very well not survive such a collapse and ends up going down along with his regime. Given that we're talking about a one man dictatorship, that might as well mean the end of Russia to Putin as it would be the end for him.\n\nWith all this in mind, I could see Putin potentially reaching for the nuclear option after at least one of the previous options was tested out and found to yield insufficient results which seems to be the most likely outcome for all of these scenarios. The nuclear one is a wild card that's bound to be disasterous in many ways and it may very well only delay or even hasten his doom rather than save him, but if all the options will end with him gone, then what reason does he have for not going for the final potential out once that's all he has left? I guess he may think that he can survive losing the war and still continue ruling Russia, ala post-Gulf war Saddam, even if it will take an enormous amount of effort to hold onto power, or maybe escape to China and live out the rest of his days in Shanxi, but are these scenarios really good enough guarantees for him? I don't know, I would love to hear of a proposal that would reduce the risk of nukes being used in the future that's not just forcing Ukraine to sign their defeat or essentially ignoring the issue and counting on a desperate Putin's judgement skills to do the work.",

Because I realistically don't think the Donbas can be reintegrated into Ukraine. It genuinely had a lot of Russians there, and since 2014, has been thoroughly Russified. I would be willing to change my stance on this though if my premise is false, but the mere fact that the Donbas has been able to field seemingly every combat age male and that most of them seem willing tells me that they aren't being held hostage when they're fighting. Historically, Russians populated this area heavily during the Soviet era, so it seems natural to me\n\nCrimea I actually agree is a mistake of Soviet history. The territory was always very pro Russian. \n\nI respect the rights of Ukrainians, but simultaneously, I feel like crimea's desire to not be Ukrainian is genuine. They have a history of hostility to Ukraine.\n\nEdit: when I say always, I mean since 1950s. I understand the tartars were not pro Russian but unfortunately, they were mostly genocided  and replaced by Russians. You cannot undo that 70+ year of pro-Russian majority and identity without essentially committing an ethnic cleansing against those 70 years of Russian settlers.\n\nEdit 2: I don't think historical claims alone back the Russian claim to crimea. I think the historical claims lends credence to the fact that the current majority of the Crimean population are willfully a part of Russia. I think crimea should be allowed to be Russian because the majority of current people there want to be Russian, and those people have a long history of tensions with Ukraine showing that this isn't a fleeting opinion.",

Specifically, at the time when it was transferred to the Ukrainian SSR, it had just gone through Holodomor (which had killed a lot of the Tatars &amp; post-famine repopulation was mainly from Russia) and a further huge mass ethnic transfer, where the remaining Tatars were deported to central Asia. </p>\n\n<p>Not that it wasn&#39;t majority Russian at the moment of donation, but it seems pretty farcical to talk of &quot;mistakes of Soviet history&quot; without mentioning that it might not even be a majority Russian area in the first place without Stalin&#39;s terror that took place right before said &quot;mistake&quot; (and <em>certainly</em> wouldn&#39;t be if the Russian empire hadn&#39;t done its own share of ethnic cleansing in the 19th century).</p>\n</div>",
