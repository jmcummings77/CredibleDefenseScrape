After the appearance of a video from the eastern outskirts of Zarechny with a blown up bridge (49.021573, 37.952583), which was occupied by the Armed Forces of Ukraine, it became clear that the entire \u201croad of life\u201d was already under the control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Russian artillery continues to work on suitable units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, but if earlier attention was focused on the Liman, now the goal of the Ukrainian formations is to block Kremennaya and take control of the reservoirs on the Zherebets River. Most likely, the active phase of the offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine from Kupyansk and Redkodub to Svatovo, through which the supply routes of the RF Armed Forces pass, will soon resume. The loss of Liman is, first of all, a serious damage to the reputation of the Russian Federation.

In circles around the military, they are discussing that after ratification on October 5, full-scale hostilities will begin: a wide range of weapons and military equipment will be lifted into the air, hell will be created in Western Ukraine, and then we will live.

The clean evenness of the circle is another indicator; if that was dirt and stuff from the ground, it would be all different shapes and sizes, some of it would fly at different speeds or with different trajectories, forming an irregular splash rather than a perfect circle. There would also be gaps where it&#39;s blocked by something that didn&#39;t get annihilated.</p>\n</div>",

Therefore, it\u2019s difficult to say how many Russians where able to actually retreat before the encirclement became complete. \n\n2. In the end there was only a handful of roads that the Russians could retreat at, and these roads were within artillery range. If the Ukrainians were able to target the retreating Russian forces with artillery, it could indeed have been a slaughter.\n\nIn the end I agree that it is wise to be sceptical regarding the reports. At the same time, the late retreat means that it is likely that the Russians suffered greater casualties than during the capture of Kupiansk.

North America is also home to four of the stations, with three locations in Toronto and one in New York City. In all, there are 54 such stations in 30 different countries.\n\nThe report details how China has attempted to \"combat the growing issue of fraud and telecommunication fraud by Chinese nationals living abroad,\" running operations that have resulted in 230,000 Chinese nationals being \"persuaded to return\" to China \"voluntarily\" over the last year to face criminal prosecution.\n\nThe Chinese government has claimed that the stations provide vital services to its citizens living abroad, though the report notes that many of the services are those that would be traditionally carried out by an overseas embassy. Instead, the report argues that the stations have been used to enhance China's overseas law enforcement capabilities in possible violation of international law.\n\nThe report also outlines the potential human rights abuses associated with the stations, including using harassment and intimidation methods, such as threatening the family members of the overseas citizens. The stations have also served as centers to spread Chinese government propaganda and monitor the behavior and opinions of Chinese nationals.\n\n\"As these operations continue to develop, and new mechanisms are set up, it is evident that countries governed by the standards set by universal human rights and the rule of law urgently need to investigate these practices to identify the (local) actors at work, mitigate the risks and effectively protect the growing number of those targeted,\" the report concludes.",

The armies have wanted to join for a long time, and Finnish official position has been \"NATO option\", readiness to apply if situation changes. Sweden did not have such a policy, but despite that they are more NATO compatible on the material side. \n\nThe airforces and navies do a lot more exercises and other common operations with their NATO counterparts, making them more ready to operate together with our new allies. Ground forces conduct common exercises as well, but especially for Finland, only a small portion of the army has ever trained with foreigners. \n\nFinnish army has some major doctrinal and material issues that are not in accordance with NATO standards. Our service rifle fires 7.62x39 ammo, the original AK round, which is not standard in NATO. Our GPMGs are PKMs in 7.62x54R, also a non standard Russian cartridge. Our heavy MGs are NSVs, bought from the Soviet Union and firing 12.7x108, instead of the NATO standard 12.7x99. Our artillery uses mostly Soviet standard 122mm guns and NATO standard 155s. \n\nOn to the doctrinal issues. We use 6000 mil circle instead of the NATO standard 6400 mil circle. Therefore all of our artillery systems, command and control, firing commands, maps, compasses, angle measuring equipment, fire control computers and training is non standard. It is also really hard to retrain the troops even if all the maps and equipment is replaced. Our reserve system works in troop production basis, every army company and battery trains one unit of conscripts into reserve every 6 months. Those reservists will then get refresher exercises over the years, but that is very limited. Transition to a new system would take 15 years if the current reserve is not retrained, and retraining multiple tens of thousands of reservists is a huge undertaking, when only 20,000 reservists got refresher trained every year. \n\nOur artillery and infantry doctrines are also very different from what I know about Americans for example. That might be a non issue tho as I don't know how big doctrinal differences exist between current NATO members. \n\nOne saving grace is the fact that Finland does not actually need a NATO standard army. We don't need to be able to call fires from foreign artillery, we don't need to know how to operate together with foreign units. Our army is already strong enough to defend Finland alone if needed. The main support in war that Finland would benefit from is air support, and our JTACs are trained in NATO standards already due to our airforce following them.",

Therefore, I cannot remain silent about what happened in Krasny Liman. The defense of this section was led by the commander of the Central Military District, Colonel-General Alexander Lapin. The same Lapin, who received the star of the Hero of Russia for the capture of Lisichansk, although de facto he was not there and was not around. Lapin was also given over to the troops of the Western Military District. The colonel-general deployed mobilized fighters from the LPR and other units on all frontiers of the Liman direction, but did not provide them with the necessary communications, interaction and the supply of ammunition. Two weeks ago, Major General Commander of the Akhmat Special Forces, my dear BROTHER Apty Alaudinov, personally reported to me that our fighters could become an easy target. In turn, I informed Valery Gerasimov, Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, about the danger. But the general assured me that he had no doubts about Lapin's leadership talent and did not believe that a retreat was possible in Krasny Liman and its environs. A week later, Lapin moves his headquarters to Starobelsk, a hundred kilometers from his subordinates, while he himself sits in Lugansk. How can you quickly manage units, being 150 km away from them? Due to the lack of elementary military logistics, today we have left several settlements and a large piece of territory. It's not a shame that Lapin is mediocre. And the fact that he is covered at the top by the leaders in the General Staff. If I had my way, I would have demoted Lapin to the rank of private, would have deprived him of his awards and, with a machine gun in his hands, would have sent him to the front lines to wash away my shame with blood. Army nepotism will not lead to good. In the army, it is necessary to appoint people of a strong character, courageous, principled, who worry about their fighters, who tear their teeth for their soldier, who know that a subordinate cannot be left without help and support. There is no place for nepotism in the army, especially in difficult times. We didn't have enough raisins? Even then, I said: shoot at the enemy\u2019s military concentration in the Izyum captured by the Nazis, especially since our artillery at that time had such an opportunity. They would have done away with the main Satanists and fascists at once. We must carry out NWO in the full sense of the word, and not flirt. Use every opportunity and every weapon to defend OUR territory. Donetsk is still being shelled. Residents of the joined 4 territories want to be protected. I don't know what the RF Ministry of Defense reports to the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, but in my personal opinion, more drastic measures should be taken, up to the declaration of martial law in the border areas and the use of low-yield nuclear weapons. It is not necessary to take every decision with an eye on the Western American community - it has already said so and done a lot against us. Yesterday there was a parade in Izyum, today a flag in Liman, and what tomorrow? Everything would be fine if it weren't so bad.\n\n\nIs the last line from a blues song or what.

        "body": "[New CITeam report out. ](https://notes.citeam.org/WdoI67ubSDb)\n\nSummary for September 30 - October 1 (until 14:30)\n\n>**The situation on the front line**\n\n>Ukrainian forces are expanding the Kupyansky bridgehead - now they have liberated the village of Kurilovka. In this direction, they have to fight against the 27th Motorized Rifle Brigade from the 1st Tank Army, known for its military failures.\n\n>In Donetsk region, the village of Drobyshevo was liberated. In addition to video evidence, there is also an official statement from the representative of the Eastern grouping of Ukrainian troops Sergei Cherevaty.\n\n>After the liberation of Yampol, a \"boiler\" is formed around the Estuary, so now the battles are going on for its \"neck\" in the area of Zarechny - a narrow corridor shot by Ukrainian troops, along which the Russian group is trying to retreat.\n\n>There was a video of a large column of equipment leaving the Estuary towards Zarechny. RIA Novosti publishes a report on reinforcements sent from Kreminnaya towards Liman. In comments on the pro-Russian Lost Armour project, they write that these reserves are going towards Liman to hold the corridor between Torsky (under Russian control) and Liman to allow Russian troops to leave the encirclement.\n\n>There were videos of soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, presumably on the eastern outskirts of the Estuary (from the part of the Yamal) and a video with the installation of the Ukrainian flag on the stele with the inscription \"Liman\" on the north-western outskirts of the city (from the side of Drobyshevo). Nevertheless, at 14:30 Moscow time there is no visual confirmation of the capture of the Estuary, although even pro-Russian sources write that most of the Russian group left the city last night, and the Ukrainian military has already been seen on the streets of Lyman.\n\n>The importance of the Estuary lies in the fact that this is the key to promotion to Svatovo (Lugansk region).\n\n>Rumors spread in various sources that due to the ceremony of joining the captured regions into Russia, the Russian military was ordered to stay in Lyman so as not to spoil the solemnity of the moment by retreat. Perhaps even the ceremony itself was specially held in advance before the official signing of the treaties by the State Duma and the Federation Council.\n\n>Footage from the BMP-2M with the tactical sign \"bear's paw in a circle\" (3rd Army Corps) were published. It is claimed that they were filmed in Donetsk and Kharkiv regions, this confirms that units of the 3rd Army Corps are really sent to different directions to hold the front line.\n\n>On the night of September 29-30, Russian forces fired at Nikolaev with rampage ammunition \"Geran-2\" (Shahed-136) and missiles. One of the rockets hit a nine-storey building, there may be people under the rubble. By the morning of September 30, eight wounded were known.\n\n>Photos of the consequences of a missile strike on a motor transport enterprise in Dnipro appeared. During the search operation, the bodies of three dead were found.\n\n>According to the adviser to the head of the office of the President Tymoshenko, the shelling of a column of civilian vehicles in the Zaporozhye region was fired from the S-300 anti-aircraft missile system on September 30. A total of 16 missiles were fired, four of which hit the car market area and the concentration of civilian transport. According to information as of the evening of September 30, 30 people had died and 88 injured.\n\n>Ukraine has received a new type of shells for HIMARS MLRS - M30A1 guided missiles designed to defeat accumulations of manpower.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://notes.citeam.org/WdoI67ubSDb\">New CITeam report out. </a></p>\n\n<p>Summary for September 30 - October 1 (until 14:30)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>The situation on the front line</strong></p>\n\n<p>Ukrainian forces are expanding the Kupyansky bridgehead - now they have liberated the village of Kurilovka. In this direction, they have to fight against the 27th Motorized Rifle Brigade from the 1st Tank Army, known for its military failures.</p>\n\n<p>In Donetsk region, the village of Drobyshevo was liberated. In addition to video evidence, there is also an official statement from the representative of the Eastern grouping of Ukrainian troops Sergei Cherevaty.</p>\n\n<p>After the liberation of Yampol, a &quot;boiler&quot; is formed around the Estuary, so now the battles are going on for its &quot;neck&quot; in the area of Zarechny - a narrow corridor shot by Ukrainian troops, along which the Russian group is trying to retreat.</p>\n\n<p>There was a video of a large column of equipment leaving the Estuary towards Zarechny. RIA Novosti publishes a report on reinforcements sent from Kreminnaya towards Liman. In comments on the pro-Russian Lost Armour project, they write that these reserves are going towards Liman to hold the corridor between Torsky (under Russian control) and Liman to allow Russian troops to leave the encirclement.</p>\n\n<p>There were videos of soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, presumably on the eastern outskirts of the Estuary (from the part of the Yamal) and a video with the installation of the Ukrainian flag on the stele with the inscription &quot;Liman&quot; on the north-western outskirts of the city (from the side of Drobyshevo). Nevertheless, at 14:30 Moscow time there is no visual confirmation of the capture of the Estuary, although even pro-Russian sources write that most of the Russian group left the city last night, and the Ukrainian military has already been seen on the streets of Lyman.</p>\n\n<p>The importance of the Estuary lies in the fact that this is the key to promotion to Svatovo (Lugansk region).</p>\n\n<p>Rumors spread in various sources that due to the ceremony of joining the captured regions into Russia, the Russian military was ordered to stay in Lyman so as not to spoil the solemnity of the moment by retreat. Perhaps even the ceremony itself was specially held in advance before the official signing of the treaties by the State Duma and the Federation Council.</p>\n\n<p>Footage from the BMP-2M with the tactical sign &quot;bear&#39;s paw in a circle&quot; (3rd Army Corps) were published. It is claimed that they were filmed in Donetsk and Kharkiv regions, this confirms that units of the 3rd Army Corps are really sent to different directions to hold the front line.</p>\n\n<p>On the night of September 29-30, Russian forces fired at Nikolaev with rampage ammunition &quot;Geran-2&quot; (Shahed-136) and missiles. One of the rockets hit a nine-storey building, there may be people under the rubble. By the morning of September 30, eight wounded were known.</p>\n\n<p>Photos of the consequences of a missile strike on a motor transport enterprise in Dnipro appeared. During the search operation, the bodies of three dead were found.</p>\n\n<p>According to the adviser to the head of the office of the President Tymoshenko, the shelling of a column of civilian vehicles in the Zaporozhye region was fired from the S-300 anti-aircraft missile system on September 30. A total of 16 missiles were fired, four of which hit the car market area and the concentration of civilian transport. According to information as of the evening of September 30, 30 people had died and 88 injured.</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine has received a new type of shells for HIMARS MLRS - M30A1 guided missiles designed to defeat accumulations of manpower. The peculiarity of these missiles is that they are blown up in the air, even before touching the ground, providing a large area of impact by fragments.</p>\n\n<p>Many military analysts note that the statements of American officials to extend the supply of 18 HIMARS MLRS units for two years are a signal to the Russian leadership. Thus, the United States announces its intentions to provide long-term, long-term support to Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>The Pentagon will create a new command to help Ukraine. The system of education and assistance to Ukraine, which was spontaneously created in February, needs to be simplified and organized.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mobilization news</strong></p>\n\n<p>Due to mobilization, the prices of body armor have risen sharply throughout Russia. The average price of the simplest body armor starts around 100 thousand rubles, and some cost even more - about 250 thousand rubles. Something similar, according to rumors, happened in February-March in Europe, when Ukrainians bought all the bulletproof vests there.</p>\n\n<p>Also, due to mobilization in Russia, there was a shortage of hemostatic harnesses and other important components of the first aid kit.</p>\n\n<p>The provision of mobilized people almost completely fell on the shoulders of the mobilized themselves and their relatives.

He also mentions that the Generals consider their armies as their life's work, therefore they see also their lifework destroyed.\n- He believes that Russia cannot stop now because this will accelerate its destruction and split into many nations.\n- He thinks that Russia has put itself into a corner but there is still a way out. The way out would be for Russia to acknowledge that all this situation has been a mistake, the acceptance of Ukraine to the internationally recognised borders of 91' and lastly to try to initiate a dialogue will all of the world's nations.\n- This \"way out\" however means that the power in Kremlin must be transferred. There are already processes in Moscow set into motion to transfer the power and there are a lot of candidates some of them are known some of them are not.\n- When asked if this transfer of power will benefit Ukraine, he replied that only with the conditions that Russia will accept this new world and that they truly will want to change themselves and the second condition will be that Ukraine will learn from its mistakes so far, and use this knowledge to proceed forward. If these two conditions will not be fulfilled then this transfer of power will change nothing whatsoever.\n- He also mentioned that he considers that the mechanisms in Moscow are in place to sell all these points to the Russian public.",
