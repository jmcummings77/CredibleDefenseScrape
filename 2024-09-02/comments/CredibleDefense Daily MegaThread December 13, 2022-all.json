Much like Ukrainian was crimes are justified after the fact and brushed aside.\n\nHow can you even start to pretend that Ukraine is held to higher standards?

There are literally 3,700 ATACMS in US hands already made and ready to go, this is literally the perfect war for them. In almost all wars with the US, the US Air Force would have bombed all the high-value targets long before the US Army gets to them. ATACMS has a \"measly\" 190 mile range, while the USAF was sending B-52 bombers from the continental US to bomb targets in Iraq and then flying them back home. Even Tomahawk cruise missiles have a 1,000+ mile range. The US Air Force and Navy is the primary long-range striking arm of the US military. Thus the US would be fine even if we gave every ATACMS to Ukraine. The Ukrainians already know how to use HIMARS and M270 GMLRS too. If we don't send them, then it was a waste of money making them if they never get used and just collect dust in a warehouse somewhere, plus it would be supporting the freedom of an underdog nation. Lastly, ATACMS is going to be retired and replaced by Precision Strike Missile anyway. Better they be used to support a worthy cause than destroyed because the whole system simply got retired.

There are literally 3,700 ATACMS in US hands already made and ready to go, this is literally the perfect war for them. In almost all wars with the US, the US Air Force would have bombed all the high-value targets long before the US Army gets to them. ATACMS has a &quot;measly&quot; 190 mile range, while the USAF was sending B-52 bombers from the continental US to bomb targets in Iraq and then flying them back home. Even Tomahawk cruise missiles have a 1,000+ mile range. The US Air Force and Navy is the primary long-range striking arm of the US military. Thus the US would be fine even if we gave every ATACMS to Ukraine. The Ukrainians already know how to use HIMARS and M270 GMLRS too. If we don&#39;t send them, then it was a waste of money making them if they never get used and just collect dust in a warehouse somewhere, plus it would be supporting the freedom of an underdog nation. Lastly, ATACMS is going to be retired and replaced by Precision Strike Missile anyway. Better they be used to support a worthy cause than destroyed because the whole system simply got retired. It would also cost money to properly dispose of them too.</p>\n</div>",

You personally don't have a clue but you're assuming a major effect despite zero data to support it, all based on OSINT footage of secondary explosions supposedly caused by a GLMRS strike. \n\nThe whole reason Bomb Damage Assessment is absolutely CRUCIAL to effective military strike ops is so nobody does what you're trying to do now, equate boom with positive effects. \n\nA supposed large drop in Russian arty fire rates can be explained a dozen ways.

With an extremely observable drop in amount of shells fired in a specific time period, one in which precise numbers doesn't matter. I might as well say that it went from \"A lot\" to \"Not a lot\"\n\nBut for a more specific source, here you go https://breakingdefense.com/2022/09/russias-military-facing-steep-artillery-import-challenges-six-months-into-invasion/\n\nAnd just in case you mention it, the article is from September but there was an earlier article in June talking about artillery fire being 5-6 million (before the interdiction campaign). \n\n> You're again basing that analysis only on your own observation, which misses data points.\n\nThat doesn't mean I'm wrong\n\n> For instance, you're focused on August as the drop and yet the artillery depot interdiction campaign started in earnest in late June:\n\nYes you're right, I did skip July. But that doesn't change my overall point. In June Russia was firing a massive amount of artillery. After the interdiction campaign started significantly less ammo was being fired. The results were immediate by the way, over the span of 1-2 weeks after HIMARS started the campaign, Russian guns stopped shooting, by a lot. \n\nIt was to the point that commentators and analysts said that if HIMARS had been there 2-3 weeks earlier, the fall of Lysychansk might have been averted. \n\nOccams Razor suggests that the massive amount of exploded artillery ammo is the simplest explanation, vs your nebulous assertion that Russia decided to just give up on the Battle of Donbas. \n\n> So what actually happened in late July that better explains this drop in fires? In late July roughly half the BTGs in the Donbas were transferred\n\nThis is incorrect. Russia transferred some BTGs to Kherson but they did not pull out half and the bulk of the Russian army was still in the Donbas area. The transfer of forces occurred over the span of a few months and does not/cannot explain the sudden halt of advance of the Russian forces with only a few BTGs slowly being routed to Kherson. \n\nThe number of troops Russia transferred brought the estimated total up to 15-20k in mid August from 5-10k in June. That is not any significant shift in forces\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/08/12/ukraine-kherson-battle/\n\n> Don't insult me when I use actual evidence of almost half the Russian BTGs in the Donbas, including all the VDV, leaving the Donbas to reinforce other sectors causing a halt to fires that had been performed to support an offensive that was largely halted\n\nlmao your source in no way backs up that claim. The article in question does not mention the size of the relocated force, does not mention the VDV. You're talking out your ass. \n\n> versus you watching TikTok videos of faraway explosions of supposed ammo depots. \n\nComplete strawman is stupid\n\n> And we know this to be true when they transferred all of the forces of the Eastern Military District out of the Donbas to Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. \n\nIf that were true why did their attacks in Donbas continue despite \"half\" of the troops being pulled out? Oh wait because that's an incorrect assessment.",

                        "body": "Indeed. I wouldn't be surprised if the agreement between Russia and Iran includes a transfer of technology in many fields. And there is some speculation that Iran might want to locally manufacture a second batch of Su-35's, similar how HAL produces Su-30's in India under licence.\n\nRegarding Iran's ballistic missile arsenal; it's good to know that Iran hasn't just been building thousands of medium to long range ballistic missiles the past few decades, but has also come up with an ingenious conversion kit that turns unguided artillery rockets (Like Zelzal-2) into guided missiles. It is estimated that Hezbollah alone has 14.000 Zelzal-2 in its arsenal, so Iran's ballistic missiles probably features in the tens of thousands.\n\nAbout the conversion kit:\n\n[Iran unveils kit to convert artillery rockets into guided missiles](https://www.timesofisrael.com/iran-unveils-kit-to-convert-artillery-rockets-into-guided-missiles/)\n\n>The Iranian military says it has produced a new conversion kit to upgrade artillery rockets to surface-to-surface missiles, technology that Israel has accused Tehran of attempting to deliver to the Hezbollah terror group.  \n  \n>The Iranians unveiled the new guidance system upgrade, called Labeik, at an event Thursday at which a number of new military technologies were showcased, according to Jane\u2019s Defence Weekly.  \n  \n>Jane\u2019s reported that Labeik appeared similar to the guidance systems on the Fateh-110 series of rockets, many of which are believed to be in the hands of Hezbollah in Lebanon. According to the report, the new system also looks to be compatible with Zelzal heavy artillery rockets.  \n  \n>Video footage of the new conversion system aired on Iranian television shows a short body featuring four inverted fins that can be fitted between the rocket and its payload.According to Iran\u2019s Fars News, the \u201canti-armor \u2018Labeik 1\u2019 missiles\u2026 enjoy precision-striking power.\u201d  \n\n>\u201cThere is nothing new in the conversion itself, they have been doing it for years, and they already showed conversion kits for the Fatah 110 family of missiles,\u201d Uzi Rubin, one of the pioneers of Israel\u2019s earliest attempts at missile defense, told The Times of Israel.  \n  \n>\u201cWhat\u2019s new here are the aerodynamics of the winglets \u2014 very unique, unseen in Iran to date and unseen in any other country. Going to indigenous design rather than copying others indicates self-confidence. The purpose of the new and unique aerodynamics is probably to increase the maneuverability of the converted rockets.\u201d  \n \n>Asked if the development of the new system had any implications for Hezbollah\u2019s missile program or how Israel deals with the terror group, Rubin replied that it \u201cdefinitely\u201d did.  \n\n>\u201cThis is exactly the \u2018precision rocket\u2019 project that Netanyahu and the IDF regard as a Red Line,\u201d he said.\n\nMore:\n\n>In 2016, Iran shifted its strategy and reportedly began smuggling conversion kits into Lebanon to upgrade Hezbollah\u2019s missiles. The suitcase-sized kits can add a GPS navigation and guidance system that increases the Zelzal-2\u2019s accuracy and range to 300 km, or 185 miles. Engineers can reportedly convert a Zelzal-2 in two to three hours; the cost of converting an imprecise rocket into a guided missile costs between $5,000 and $10,000. Between 2016 and 2019, Hezbollah converted between 20 and 200 missiles, the Britain Israel Communications and Research Centre estimated.\n\n[https://iranprimer.usip.org/blog/2021/feb/03/irans-missiles-transfers-proxies](https://iranprimer.usip.org/blog/2021/feb/03/irans-missiles-transfers-proxies)\n\nFootage of the Labeik-1 missile conversion kit:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5\\_kwxcd-4vk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_kwxcd-4vk&t=38s)",
                        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Indeed. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the agreement between Russia and Iran includes a transfer of technology in many fields. And there is some speculation that Iran might want to locally manufacture a second batch of Su-35&#39;s, similar how HAL produces Su-30&#39;s in India under licence.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding Iran&#39;s ballistic missile arsenal; it&#39;s good to know that Iran hasn&#39;t just been building thousands of medium to long range ballistic missiles the past few decades, but has also come up with an ingenious conversion kit that turns unguided artillery rockets (Like Zelzal-2) into guided missiles. It is estimated that Hezbollah alone has 14.000 Zelzal-2 in its arsenal, so Iran&#39;s ballistic missiles probably features in the tens of thousands.</p>\n\n<p>About the conversion kit:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/iran-unveils-kit-to-convert-artillery-rockets-into-guided-missiles/\">Iran unveils kit to convert artillery rockets into guided missiles</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Iranian military says it has produced a new conversion kit to upgrade artillery rockets to surface-to-surface missiles, technology that Israel has accused Tehran of attempting to deliver to the Hezbollah terror group.  </p>\n\n<p>The Iranians unveiled the new guidance system upgrade, called Labeik, at an event Thursday at which a number of new military technologies were showcased, according to Jane\u2019s Defence Weekly.  </p>\n\n<p>Jane\u2019s reported that Labeik appeared similar to the guidance systems on the Fateh-110 series of rockets, many of which are believed to be in the hands of Hezbollah in Lebanon. According to the report, the new system also looks to be compatible with Zelzal heavy artillery rockets.  </p>\n\n<p>Video footage of the new conversion system aired on Iranian television shows a short body featuring four inverted fins that can be fitted between the rocket and its payload.According to Iran\u2019s Fars News, the \u201canti-armor \u2018Labeik 1\u2019 missiles\u2026 enjoy precision-striking power.\u201d  </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThere is nothing new in the conversion itself, they have been doing it for years, and they already showed conversion kits for the Fatah 110 family of missiles,\u201d Uzi Rubin, one of the pioneers of Israel\u2019s earliest attempts at missile defense, told The Times of Israel.  </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s new here are the aerodynamics of the winglets \u2014 very unique, unseen in Iran to date and unseen in any other country. Going to indigenous design rather than copying others indicates self-confidence. The purpose of the new and unique aerodynamics is probably to increase the maneuverability of the converted rockets.\u201d  </p>\n\n<p>Asked if the development of the new system had any implications for Hezbollah\u2019s missile program or how Israel deals with the terror group, Rubin replied that it \u201cdefinitely\u201d did.  </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis is exactly the \u2018precision rocket\u2019 project that Netanyahu and the IDF regard as a Red Line,\u201d he said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>More:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In 2016, Iran shifted its strategy and reportedly began smuggling conversion kits into Lebanon to upgrade Hezbollah\u2019s missiles. The suitcase-sized kits can add a GPS navigation and guidance system that increases the Zelzal-2\u2019s accuracy and range to 300 km, or 185 miles. Engineers can reportedly convert a Zelzal-2 in two to three hours; the cost of converting an imprecise rocket into a guided missile costs between $5,000 and $10,000.

They had that \"domestically produced fighter\" unveiled relatively recently that was a copy of an F-4, an aircraft that first flew in the 1950s. And unless something drastic has changed they were even having trouble producing engines that could power that.\n\nI don't understand the complete specifics but what I have read is that turbine blade construction is unbelievably sensitive in terms of heat treatment, as well as sensitive to material embargos on metals, which is why so few nations in an absolute sense actually produce engines. It seems like it wouldn't be enough to simply give the iranians SU-35 engine specifications, they would need to be given a complete factory setup to build it, or straight up provide them with engines which are already in rather short supply for russia. \n\nTherefore while I could certainly see a sale + long term support agreement as a plausible exchange, I don't think iranian-produced SU-35s is at all realistic. Someone with more expertise can feel free to chime in and correct me, but I feel like their reputation for reverse engineering has been kind of exaggerated by the usual defense process of trying to make a case for funding. Most of what they have reverse engineered are much simpler drone designs, with no clear indication that they actually replicate the more technically advanced functions of the design they copy.",

And if so, would a hybrid vehicle have made any difference to the issues they experienced on that road?\n\nAs far as I can tell, there were two main reasons to keep the engines idling. First was to keep electrical going for radios and RADARs. Second would have been for heating, so even vehicles that didn't have a tactical need to be running were running anyway.\n\nA hybrid wouldn't have helped for the heating purposes, but may have helped reduce fuel usage for the electronics. Maybe, depending on specifics.\n\nOne of the advantages a hybrid can leverage is that they can run the traditional engine at a peak efficiency RPM while they charge the battery.

I started this discussion by \"trying to minimize\" ***UKRAINIAN*** losses, by saying some TB2 losses may be duplicates and one actual loss is unintentionally counted twice.\n\nMy sole goal here is to promote accuracy as much as possible. That is all I care about for this discussion. More generally, I hate Putin and this power grab war and am glad they are losing and that Ukraine will retake their territory, though this will still grind on longer than anyone wants.\n\nThe original claim was:\n\n>Only 100% visually confirmed tank losses on oryx are about 1600. He is claiming total loss of 1400. It's kinda not clever.\n\nThis implies that those 1,600 losses are all visually guaranteed to be unique and completely destroyed, which are not accurate assumptions. My sole point was \"Those are not the best assumptions with that data, both number may be accurate at the same time depending on how you draw the lines, and here are two reasons why\". Thus far I have stuck to those to points as those were the two relevant to the original claim that could make both valid.\n\nYou have now brought up others.\n\n>How many destroyed tanks haven't been recorded?\n\nLikely few. A destroyed tank in an area Ukraine retakes shortly thereafter is almost certain to be photographed by somebody, so the tanks destroyed we don't know about have to be in areas Russia took quickly. Since Russia has had no practical offensives in months, the current rate is likely near zero. The most probable destroyed Russian tanks that are not photographed would be those destroyed early in the conflict during their offensives by something without an organic video link (like a drone) and that were recovered before Ukraine retook that territory. These are also more likely to be recovered and repaired since you have time to make a proper assessment, though that depends on the exact damage: a burnt-out tank cannot be repaired.\n\nIf anything the Ukrainian destroyed tank number is likely significantly higher, but they are also more likely to recover and attempt to repair these tanks.\n\n>How many damaged tanks have been captured by the Ukrainians?\n\nYou clearly didn't read what I wrote, as I said:\n\n>>Abandoned tanks require a case-by-case examination to see if they were recovered by Russia or Ukraine (whoever owned the battlefield long enough to recover it), while damaged tanks were almost certainly recovered by Russia.\n\nA damaged tank captured by Ukraine is near certain to be included in the captured total, as these would generally be battlefield captures or stuck in a convoy.\n\nAlthough this brings up another good point: captured tanks are essentially \"negative losses\". If we look at the Ukrainian tank losses, this is 435 total, 254 destroyed, 22 damaged, 16 abandoned, and 143 captured. The net Russian losses would thus be 1,448-143 = 1,300 (or 1,570-143 = 1,427): you can reasonably use either one to get around 1,400.\n\nIn the reverse case, Ukraine comes out with a net -280 losses (or -99). Even assuming the number of destroyed tanks is double what we know (which is higher than I think is reasonable), Russia's attacks have on the whole given Ukraine more tanks, which underscores how badly this war has gone for Russia.\n\n>>The number of damaged tanks is almost certainly badly undercounted due to lack of photographs (tanks damaged and pulling back before photographs can be taken, no photographer in the area, etc.), and I'd estimate the real total is in the 130-650 range.\n\n>This works against your argument for 1,400 and works towards a number closer to 2,000. \n\nYou're conflating total tanks temporarily out of action from tanks permanently lost that Russia isn't getting back. Damaged tanks can be repaired, and once back in action can be damaged again or lost completely. The 1,400 claim is permanent losses, 2,000 would be total.\n\n>Per your own comment, over 1,400 tanks have VERIFIABLY been either just destroyed or captured. \n\nCorrect.\n\n>You HAVE to believe the Oryx is systemically overcounting Russian losses for your premise to even be remotely true.\n\nOr you split losses into permanent (destroyed/captured), temporary (damaged), and unclear (abandonment). Permanent losses of around 1,400 are reasonable, and total losses of 1,600 are also reasonable.\n\nPut another way (and since naval history is my focus), in WWII the US Navy had 36 fleet carriers hit by enemy action. Only four were sunk. Thus you can accurately say that the losses were four (ships sunk) and 36 (ships sunk AND ships damaged). In this case this is also more than the number of CVs we actually had (25 total before the end of the war) because numerous ships were damaged multiple times: *Enterprise* appears six times in the summary reports, *Intrepid* five, *Franklin* four, *Saratoga* and *Yorktown* (CV-5) three times, and six carriers twice.\n\nObviously the ratio is different due to the massive combat differences, but you get the point.",

There more to security calculation than that.\n\nThere's a reason why Macron alluded to a security guarantee for Russia, Gen. Milley talked about negotiations and now Zelensky is hinting at it. That leads me to believe that issues in EU/Ukraine are worse than what we are hearing. If there's a severe recession there's a strong chance that Trump might be back. Remember that Biden didn't win most electoral colleges by a full percent despite the debacle of Covid mishandling by Trump.\n\nI have touched on a few things that are affecting the current war in Ukraine. There are a lot more. BTW, I expect a nuclear Iran in a few years time with Russian help. Russia will kick us in the ass by destabilizing the Middle East.

There more to security calculation than that.</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s a reason why Macron alluded to a security guarantee for Russia, Gen. Milley talked about negotiations and now Zelensky is hinting at it. That leads me to believe that issues in EU/Ukraine are worse than what we are hearing. If there&#39;s a severe recession there&#39;s a strong chance that Trump might be back. Remember that Biden didn&#39;t win most electoral colleges by a full percent despite the debacle of Covid mishandling by Trump.</p>\n\n<p>I have touched on a few things that are affecting the current war in Ukraine. There are a lot more. BTW, I expect a nuclear Iran in a few years time with Russian help. Russia will kick us in the ass by destabilizing the Middle East. Good luck disengaging from ME after that, Gulf monarchies will invite China in for protection.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: This crisis might seriously affect the pivot to Asia. Let&#39;s see how that plays out.</p>\n</div>",

These allow you to localize your firepower to get a decisive advantage even if it would not suffice across the entire theater (see: 6 day war, Kharkiv counteroffensive, etc.).</p>\n\n<p>Now being on the defensive is generally a solid option, sure; it gives you <em>some</em> advantage across each location because the attackers will, all else equal, take higher losses. But that advantage is still contingent on the attacker lacking overwhelming, sudden, surprising local power. If Ukraine had the option of this sort of a concentrated pre-emptive strike against whatever brigades Russia is staging for a new offensive (it unfortunately doesn&#39;t), it would take it in a heartbeat. By now, though, neither side is likely to surprise the other again.</p>\n</div>",

The same can be said about Lyman to Sloviansk crossing over an area full of marshes. \n\n- With the failure of Izium frontline and from previous indications, attacks from the North of Severodonetsk river are ineffective and highly costly.\n\nThere has been quite a lot of recent information about a large concentration of mobilized infantry and a huge supply of tanks and APCs to the Svatove front line indicating a definite build-up of force in the area.\n\nI believe that we are going to observe in the next 3-4 months up until the start of mud season again, a new Russian offensive coming from Kreminna and an overall increase of intensity to capture Bakhmut due to a couple of major reasons: https://i.imgur.com/MkM3yzd.png\n\n- Bakhmut is a vital intersection for all roads leading to important targets.

I don't believe it will be the primary objective, so going toward Oskil is most likely an end goal for a peacetime agreement border. \n\n- Going around Toretsk defense and cutting it from Konstiantynivka, surpassing the incredible fortifications south of the Donbas channel, eliminating the need for a lengthy and bloody siege\n\n- Lastly, Russia will push for the high ground between both axis, which will allow the Russian army to regroup and establish critical artillery fire control over the Sloviansk, Kramatorsk, Konstiantynivka, Toretsk axis making any frontal assaults much more gradual and paced.\n\nChasiv Yar will probably be the most critical defensive position in the area since the settlement is large in a hilly area with great forestry coverage and a closeby connection to Konstiantynivka for supplies. I expect for Ukraine to hold the position there since it's vital for the Donbas channel crossing and hilltop access, though with recent Wagner progress with their crossing south of it, the whole area might potentially get compromised, we shall see how it develops.\n\nTLDR: In my personal opinion, Bakhmut is critical for the operational goals of Russia in the region and for the general defense of all Ukrainian cities in the proximity of it, making it a key asset for either side in the Donbas front.

I believe this is simply not true. \n\nI didn't theorize at all strength disparities,I didn't even mention them. \n\nI stated the UAF are strong near Kreminna, which they are, because they have multiple quality maneuver brigades on the attack, supported by artillery brigades, plus a well oiled supply line that's sustaining that offensive. \n\nWhich means it's not a weak point it's a strong point. Anyone who's paid attention to the last nine months knows full well Russia how does on the offensive against UAF strong points. Especially when the very units the Russians need to break through are the ones who kicked the crap out of Russia in September. \n\n>RAF has split its forces into 4:\nLPR + Mobiks in Luhansk front.\nWagner in Toretsk-Bakhmut-Siversk.\n1-2-3 AC of DPR around Donetsk front.\nRussian regular army in Zaporizhia and Kherson.\n\nWhere are you getting this info from? \n\nISW, Kofman, and many other sources describe RGF and VDV in the Luhansk front. We even know parts of BARS reservists were there as well as 3rd Corps who tried to stop the Kharkiv counteroffensive, plus all the units that used to be in Kharkiv oblast, Lyman, etc.\n\nAnd it's never been a pure Wagner op around Siversk-Bakhmut (I don't know why you bring up Toretsk because it's not near the front lines). Again, Kofman says that and MilitaryLand map, plus others. \n\nAlso, the 2nd Corps isn't DNR, it's LNR. And the 3rd Army Corps is Russian.\n\n>Russia confirmed that they've operationally deployed 150k from the mobilized men to combat roles and as far as we know from the sparse information, most of these reinforcements are aggregating into the Savkove area.\n\nYou're assuming they were all sent to Svatove, which doesn't even make sense since we know a substantial element ended up in the Kherson bridgehead before the retreat was conducted. Either way, those would belong to SMD, not WMD or CMD in Luhansk. \n\nAnd based on what many have said, like Kofman in his recent WotR podcast episode, they aren't organized in actual maneuver units, they're reporting to the fronts as companies and battalions of barely equipped/barely or totally untrained replacements to backfill depleted units to bring them up to strength, because Russian BTGs in that area were supposedly operating at 25% when the Kharkiv counteroffensive occurred (Source, Kofman). \n\nOverall, there is nothing at all that indicates they are offensively capable units, they're essentially \"static troops.\" If they can form Mobiks into offensively capable units, it'll take more than a month and half of preparation from mobilization notice to being on the front lines.\n\n>With the withdrawal from Kherson bridgehead, the front shortened significantly which means the Russian army regulars can concentrate on Zaporizhia.\n\nThe front that was responsible for the Kherson bridgehead is controlled by SMD and EMD to it's east, it's not just the RAF, who control the entire line (Military Districts act as army group HQs) . So Russian troops are everywhere. Feel free to check yourself, with OSINT maps like [this](https://militaryland.net/maps/deployment-map/) or ISW who reported [this less than a day ago](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-december-12)\"\n\n*The observation that elements of the Russian Airborne Forces (VDV) are operating in Luhansk Oblast suggests that they redeployed away from the west (right) bank of Kherson Oblast, where ISW previously reported they were operating prior to the massive Russian withdrawal from the right bank*\n\n>Additionally, Just the other day we had the news for the delivery of over 200 T90M tanks specifically for that area.\n\nSeriously?\n\n\"**According to a video published by the Russian Television Channel NTV on December 7, 2022,** Russia delivers a new batch of 200 T-90M Main Battle Tanks (MBTs) to the Lugansk People's Republic (LNR or LPR) Pro-Russian military forces.\"\n\nIt's December 2022, we shouldn't be taking Russian state owned media seriously.\n\n>Moving onward, if UAF still had this definitive advantage they would have exploited it in October while the Russians were still retreating.\n\nI don't know if you heard but the weather is pretty shitty in Ukraine right now and will remain so. Even when the frost sets in they regain some tactical mobility but that doesn't suddenly make operations easier to achieve in miserably cold weather. \n\n>Secondly, the area is a dense forest that prevents the usage of guided artillery and UAVs, \n\nThis makes no sense. First, the UAF are whose lines predominantly are in that forest, so they'd have that terrain obstacle to defend from. Second, its not evergreen trees so it's suffering what every green leafy plant happens in winter, no leaves which means hiding in vegetation is quite problematic. Fourth, when the Russians leave that forest to cross the Donets river to the south, they've even more visible than they were before. Fifth, their supply lines behind the forest won't be hidden and will be in arty range of the UAF, including that artillery recon brigade sitting right there. \n\n>This favors the concentration of unguided mass Russian artillery and superiority in tank numbers and quality.\n\nThe Russians don't have massed artillery if they're attacking at the 5-6 tactical locations you showed in your map. Concentration means not dispersed. And based on the last few months, their daily fire rates dropped a bit from summer. Since their force quality has plummeted, that's problematic for an army that needs fires to move.\n\nAnd in what universe are tanks meant to attack through dense forests? Yes it's possible but they don't do well in that scenario. Forest fighting is dismounted focused, something the Russians have notorious difficulties with.\n\n>Thirdly, Russia cannot afford to do nothing with such a large mobilization wave and use it only for rotation and reserves.\n\nThey're not doing nothing, they're stabilizing the lines in an emergency sector after Russia suffered two major defeats within a short time period. That gives Putin et al breathing space, alleviating another political nightmare in the near future, and all it cost was deploying ~100,000 barely trained conscripts. Meh, kick that can down the road...\n\n>I do not believe they will try to strain their logistics even further attempting a new front somewhere else again so this is the most likely scenario where they can benefit in a crucial way.\n\nThe most likely scenario is a more ambitious Russian offensive than what they launched in spring-summer? One that has no chance of success? \n\n>Lastly, the Siversk group encirclement does not necessitate a Northern pincer, that's the Severodonetsk river's job. \n\nYou literally drew a red arrow coming from around the north side of Siversk. And a river north and east of Siversk won't encircle the UAF to the south and west of the river.\n\n>Having someone on the other side of the river with a weapon will just make it much more efficient and deadly leaving no room for retreat.\n\nHaving someone in front of me doesn't stop me from moving backwards...",

And the 3rd Army Corps is Russian.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Russia confirmed that they&#39;ve operationally deployed 150k from the mobilized men to combat roles and as far as we know from the sparse information, most of these reinforcements are aggregating into the Savkove area.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You&#39;re assuming they were all sent to Svatove, which doesn&#39;t even make sense since we know a substantial element ended up in the Kherson bridgehead before the retreat was conducted. Either way, those would belong to SMD, not WMD or CMD in Luhansk. </p>\n\n<p>And based on what many have said, like Kofman in his recent WotR podcast episode, they aren&#39;t organized in actual maneuver units, they&#39;re reporting to the fronts as companies and battalions of barely equipped/barely or totally untrained replacements to backfill depleted units to bring them up to strength, because Russian BTGs in that area were supposedly operating at 25% when the Kharkiv counteroffensive occurred (Source, Kofman). </p>\n\n<p>Overall, there is nothing at all that indicates they are offensively capable units, they&#39;re essentially &quot;static troops.&quot; If they can form Mobiks into offensively capable units, it&#39;ll take more than a month and half of preparation from mobilization notice to being on the front lines.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>With the withdrawal from Kherson bridgehead, the front shortened significantly which means the Russian army regulars can concentrate on Zaporizhia.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The front that was responsible for the Kherson bridgehead is controlled by SMD and EMD to it&#39;s east, it&#39;s not just the RAF, who control the entire line (Military Districts act as army group HQs) . So Russian troops are everywhere. Feel free to check yourself, with OSINT maps like <a href=\"https://militaryland.net/maps/deployment-map/\">this</a> or ISW who reported <a href=\"https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-december-12\">this less than a day ago</a>&quot;</p>\n\n<p><em>The observation that elements of the Russian Airborne Forces (VDV) are operating in Luhansk Oblast suggests that they redeployed away from the west (right) bank of Kherson Oblast, where ISW previously reported they were operating prior to the massive Russian withdrawal from the right bank</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Additionally, Just the other day we had the news for the delivery of over 200 T90M tanks specifically for that area.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Seriously?</p>\n\n<p>&quot;<strong>According to a video published by the Russian Television Channel NTV on December 7, 2022,</strong> Russia delivers a new batch of 200 T-90M Main Battle Tanks (MBTs) to the Lugansk People&#39;s Republic (LNR or LPR) Pro-Russian military forces.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s December 2022, we shouldn&#39;t be taking Russian state owned media seriously.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Moving onward, if UAF still had this definitive advantage they would have exploited it in October while the Russians were still retreating.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t know if you heard but the weather is pretty shitty in Ukraine right now and will remain so. Even when the frost sets in they regain some tactical mobility but that doesn&#39;t suddenly make operations easier to achieve in miserably cold weather. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Secondly, the area is a dense forest that prevents the usage of guided artillery and UAVs, </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This makes no sense. First, the UAF are whose lines predominantly are in that forest, so they&#39;d have that terrain obstacle to defend from. Second, its not evergreen trees so it&#39;s suffering what every green leafy plant happens in winter, no leaves which means hiding in vegetation is quite problematic. Fourth, when the Russians leave that forest to cross the Donets river to the south, they&#39;ve even more visible than they were before. Fifth, their supply lines behind the forest won&#39;t be hidden and will be in arty range of the UAF, including that artillery recon brigade sitting right there. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This favors the concentration of unguided mass Russian artillery and superiority in tank numbers and quality.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Russians don&#39;t have massed artillery if they&#39;re attacking at the 5-6 tactical locations you showed in your map. Concentration means not dispersed. And based on the last few months, their daily fire rates dropped a bit from summer. Since their force quality has plummeted, that&#39;s problematic for an army that needs fires to move.</p>\n\n<p>And in what universe are tanks meant to attack through dense forests? Yes it&#39;s possible but they don&#39;t do well in that scenario. Forest fighting is dismounted focused, something the Russians have notorious difficulties with.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Thirdly, Russia cannot afford to do nothing with such a large mobilization wave and use it only for rotation and reserves.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They&#39;re not doing nothing, they&#39;re stabilizing the lines in an emergency sector after Russia suffered two major defeats within a short time period. That gives Putin et al breathing space, alleviating another political nightmare in the near future, and all it cost was deploying ~100,000 barely trained conscripts. Meh, kick that can down the road...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I do not believe they will try to strain their logistics even further attempting a new front somewhere else again so this is the most likely scenario where they can benefit in a crucial way.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The most likely scenario is a more ambitious Russian offensive than what they launched in spring-summer? One that has no chance of success? </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Lastly, the Siversk group encirclement does not necessitate a Northern pincer, that&#39;s the Severodonetsk river&#39;s job. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You literally drew a red arrow coming from around the north side of Siversk. And a river north and east of Siversk won&#39;t encircle the UAF to the south and west of the river.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Having someone on the other side of the river with a weapon will just make it much more efficient and deadly leaving no room for retreat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Having someone in front of me doesn&#39;t stop me from moving backwards...</p>\n</div>",

Ukraine continues to make fitful but steady progress towards taking Kreminna, which imo is far more likely than Russia trying to reopen an avenue to attack Slovyansk/Kramatorsk from the North. To put that another way, the chances of Russia retaking Lyman and Izyum is practically nil. \n\nSecond, your assumption that Bakhmut is destined to fall is faulty. Russia has made incremental progress on that front over the course of months, and they're still only on the outskirts of the city and there's been very little progress in enveloping the city. A frontal attack on Bakhmut (which appears to be the current Russian plan) is going to be extremely costly for them, and is unlikely to be successful. \n\nThird, I have no idea why you think Russia might be in a position to launch an offensive over the Winter. They're still on the backfoot on most fronts, their army is mostly made up of poorly trained and equipped conscripts with dubious Winter kit and poor leadership, and they're still trying to process most of the mobiks they rounded up in September. In recent months all Russia has been able to do offensively is maintain a localized slow and grinding effort against Bakhmut with negligible success at great cost, and (possibly?) take the small town of Pavlivka, again with huge losses. Seems pretty clear to me at least that Russian forces are exhausted and need time to integrate the mobiks, rest/refit/rotate forces, build up stockpiles, and prepare for a potential offensive in the Spring, all while Ukraine does everything in its power to prevent them from achieving this. \n\nSo I'm really not sure where you're getting these predictions from as they're not in touch with what we're seeing on the battlefield.",

Seems pretty clear to me at least that Russian forces are exhausted and need time to integrate the mobiks, rest/refit/rotate forces, build up stockpiles, and prepare for a potential offensive in the Spring, all while Ukraine does everything in its power to prevent them from achieving this. </p>\n\n<p>So I&#39;m really not sure where you&#39;re getting these predictions from as they&#39;re not in touch with what we&#39;re seeing on the battlefield.</p>\n</div>",

Then, later on, if the Russians want to blow up trucks loaded with concrete liners or dirt as they come and go, they're going to have to use some very expensive PGMs to make that happen and (relatively speaking) trucks are cheap and easy to replace, so that would be a wildly unfavorable trade for the Russians. \n\nIn fact, it might be advantageous not to keep it secret because that would fix more Russian forces in western Kherson, farther away from the critical fighting in the east. The Ukrainians would be using a tunneling crew of civilian workers to achieve that effect, as opposed to combat forces that could be allocated elsewhere.\n\nAs for the tunneling rate, let's say they can only make 10m per day of progress while attempting to build a 1km tunnel. Call it 100 days of work, plus a week on either end for finishing off the entrances. If they started in a month, it'd be done by May. Optimistically they could be done earlier, which would force the Russians to defend against the possibility even if it takes longer, or even if they never complete the tunnel. Worst case, if the war is over by then (which I hope for but doubt), the Ukrainians are left with a very useful tunnel to replace the bridges that have been destroyed. \n\nAnyway, as I admitted originally, it's a batshit crazy idea, but highlights an interesting hole in most militaries' capabilities (no pun intended). Being able to build tunnels rapidly in situations like this, or in the much more common scenarios encountered during urban combat, may become an increasingly important capability as modern combat more and more follows the rule \"if the enemy can see you, they can kill you.\" That makes it hard to move around, obviously.
