As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

Roughly about 40 of them were ever built.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Edit: <a href=\"https://nitter.net/davidhelms570/status/1746653654679986261#m\">Another Tweet</a> lending some credence to a plane circulating roughly around the same area as the alleged A-50.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, a <a href=\"https://nitter.net/KyivIndependent/status/1746653333316678048#m\">tweet from Kyiv Independent</a> transmits a statement made by Zelensky:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Zelensky: &#39;Good news&#39; on air defense systems to come soon.  </p>\n\n<p>President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that Kyiv is preparing to announce \u201cgood news\u201d about air-defense systems during his evening address on Jan. 14.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Seems like we could possibly be finding out more soon.</p>\n</div>",

It seems that the \"government\" is weaker than ever before - I'm putting quotes around it, because the closer you look, the more of an absolute mess it seems. [This analysis](https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/gulf-and-arabian-peninsula/yemen/yemens-troubled-presidential-leadership-council) from *International Crisis Group* is pretty good at surveying the scene. Some general points: \n\n* Starting in 2019, the government started to collapse into infighting between UAE and Saudi-backed factions. The government was kicked out of its interim capital in Aden by the Southern Transitional Council (STC), a separatist group backed by the UAE. The UAE also started to pare down its involvement in the war at this time, presumably feeling like it was increasingly a lost cause, or at least, satisfied with its control of key areas of southern Yemen. \n* Successful Houthi offensives in 2021 in central/south Yemen in 2021 created further setbacks for the government and Saudi-backed forces. Territory was only regained when the pro-UAE Giants Brigade, a Salafist paramilitary group, shifted over from the western coastal front to push back the Houthis.\n* In April 2022, the Saudis and Emiratis essentially deposed Hadi, the head of government, and transferred powers to a new Presidential Leadership Council (PLC), an eight-member council made up of representatives from the various anti-Houthi armed formations, all backed by either the Saudis or Emiratis. The intention being, to consolidate the government and deal with any internal disputes. \n* Infighting has gotten worse, however; just a few months after the PLC formed, there were major clashes between members. In August 2022, the Giants Brigade [swept into the oil-rich Shabwa](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/clashes-oil-rich-shabwa-test-yemens-new-presidential-council-2022-08-11/) province and seized it from Islah Party militias. Almost simultaneously, the STC [launched a military campaign](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/yemeni-southern-separatists-launch-military-campaign-abyan-2022-08-23/) into Abyan against Islah, and allegedly al-Qaeda. In 2023, the pro-UAE factions also seem to be threatening to push further west into Hadrawmat province. \n* Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia is in the middle of unilateral peace talks with the Houthis, completely excluding the PLC. Its unclear what a peace deal between them will mean for Saudi support for the PLC and the anti-Houthi coalition.",

For the last couple of years, the Ukrainian media team has outmaneuvered their Russian counterparts using their own techniques, and taking the initiative in shaping the public agenda and media space (even at the expense of accurate reporting) has been a big part of that. Remember e.g. how quickly they reported news about the Moskva, about rockets crashing in Poland, about Kinzhal interceptions, and many others.\n\nIf I were running the media show on the Ukrainian side I wouldn't even care who shot down the planes, what's important is getting the folks on the other side to doubt their commanders' story, and to back the other side's media team into a corner where they need to present their version of the story in terms of straightening up the record about how exactly they screwed up (we brought it down vs. the other side brought down two airplanes above what's effectively a Russian lake now) rather than in terms of condolences, heroic sacrifices, lessons learned and retribution. Getting people to doubt their government's and their commanders' story is poisonous enough on its own, and makes public messaging even harder, as it cast doubt over whichever version of the screw-up the Russian side will come out with. Either of them will look like a very uncomfortable cover-up, as both \"they don't want to admit our guys shot it down so they're saying Ukrainians somehow downed something flying so deep into our airspace even the seagulls are speaking Russian\" and \"they don't want to admit our airspace control is so bad that Ukrainians can shoot down planes over the Azov sea, so they're saying we shot it down, as if we'd be shooting down things in an area where even the seagulls are speaking Russian\" are equally bad.\n\nThe only way this comes out badly for the Ukrainian media team is if it turns out neither plane was shot down and two days from now the VVS produces two badly-damaged but largely unharmed airplanes near Rostov or whatever. It's happened before (rocket crashes in Poland) but, if that happens, and if through some miracle the VVS can make their report bulletproof and show those are the exact two planes we're talking about now, rather than an IL-76 they strapped an antenna on and a random IL-22 airframe they had lying around that they turned fifty drunk airmen on until they looked like they nearly got shot down, by that time the harm will have been done, as few casual observers will mentally go back and review their assessment of Russian competence and morale based on new information.\n\nThing is you don't even need accurate information to cause this kind of ruckus. All you need is to see two dots going down over the Azov sea (which I'm fairly sure they can at least find out about even if they don't have their own radars tracking them, as IIRC NATO is flying AWACS missions in the area all the time) and see some extra chatter in the area. At that point, if you go out NAFO style and say something happened out there, wink wink, watch out, there's about zero chance you're wrong, and you come out on top when the real news starts going out, too.\n\nEdit: just to nip the tinfoil hats in the bud, I'm not claiming either variant about the screw-up is correct, and I'm especially *not* claiming that the Ukrainian side is lying about it and they didn't shoot down anything. I only want to point out that preemptively coming out with vague and/or unverifiable information in order to shape the public debate around a subject is something both sides have done so far. *One* version of these is likely to be right (or in any case, it looks statistically more likely than that an A-50 and an IL-22M would both fatally or nearly-fatally malfunction over the Azov on the same night and around the same time) but I wouldn't take early public statements, from either side, as an indication of which one is right.",

About 30 to 60 minutes after that, a second wave of strikes was carried out against 12 more targets that analysts had identified as posing threats to aircraft and ships.</p>\n\n<p>Hitting pop-up targets on short notice, a practice the military calls dynamic targeting, would likely be an important part of any additional strikes that President Biden might order, one of the U.S. officials said.</p>\n\n<p>A senior Defense Department official said on Saturday that a U.S. Tomahawk cruise missile strike on a radar facility in Yemen on Friday was a \u201creattack\u201d of a target originally hit in Thursday\u2019s barrage that had not been adequately degraded or destroyed.</p>\n\n<p>Despite their fiery rhetoric and vows of retaliation, the Houthis\u2019 military response to Thursday night\u2019s attack so far has been muted: just a single anti-ship missile lobbed harmlessly into the Red Sea, far from any passing vessel, General Sims said on Friday.</p>\n\n<p>But the general and the two U.S. officials on Saturday said they were bracing for the Houthis to lash out once they determined how much firepower they had left and settled on an attack plan.</p>\n\n<p>One of the two U.S. officials said the Houthis appeared to be divided internally over how to respond.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI would expect that they will attempt some sort of retaliation,\u201d General Sims said on Friday, adding that that would be a mistake. \u201cWe simply are not going to be messed with here.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Additional strikes being <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-14/us-uk-fighter-jets-strike-again-in-yemen-al-masirah-tv-says\">reported</a> as of about an hour ago:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Houthi rebels in Yemen said US and UK fighter jets hit Jadaa mountain in Al-Lahayah district in the Red Sea province of Hodeida in a new strike Sunday evening. </p>\n\n<p>Al-Masirah TV, operated by the Iran-backed military group, reported that fighter jets and surveillance drones are still hovering over the Hodeida region.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

                        "body": "An object being indispensable to the survival of the civilian population does not render it completely immune from attack like you are suggesting.\n\nText (https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/atrocity-crimes/Doc.34_AP-I-EN.pdf)\n\nAP1 54(2): \"It is prohibited to attack, destroy, remove or render useless objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, such as foodstuffs, agricultural areas for the production of foodstuffs, crops, livestock, drinking water installations and supplies and irrigation works, for the specific purpose of denying them for their sustenance value to the civilian population or to the adverse Party, whatever the motive, whether in order to starve out civilians, to cause them to move away, or for any other motive.\"\n\nCommentary on AP1 (https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/llmlp/Commentary_GC_Protocols/Commentary_GC_Protocols.pdf)\n\n\"The clause \"for the specific purpose of denying them for their sustenance value\" led to lengthy discussion. The Working Group and then Committee III had adopted the words \"for the purpose of denying them as such\"[13]. The Drafting Committee finally proposed the present wording, which was adopted in the Conference by consensus.\"\n\nand \n\n\"Even if the wording is not perfect, the meaning is clear: the objects indicated must be respected in order to guarantee the survival of the population, unless \u00ad following paragraphs 3 and 5 - military necessity requires that they be attacked, destroyed, removed or rendered useless. On this subject the examples given by the Rapporteur are meaningful. 15 The restrictions laid down in Article 57 (Precautions in attack) must of course be respected.\"\n\nFootnote 13:\n\n\"13 In this respect it is appropriate to quote the report of the Committee: \"In paragraph 2, drafting problems were posed by the fact that two of the objects listed - food-producing areas and irrigation works - might be useful to combatants for purposes other than directly for sustenance. Thus, the phrase in paragraph 2 'for the purpose of denying them as such' was designed to cover both the denial of food and drink as sustenance and the denial of food-producing areas and irrigation works for their contribution to the production of sustenance. On the other hand, it was not intended to cover their denial to the enemy for other purposes, including the general purpose of preventing the enemy from advancing. Thus, bombarding an area to prevent the advance through it of an enemy is permissible, whether or not the area produces food, but the deliberate destruction of food-producing areas in order to prevent the enemy from growing food on them is forbidden. *Similarly, destroying a field of crops in order to clear a field for fire or to prevent the enemy using it for cover is permissible, but destroying it to prevent the enemy from consuming the crops is forbidden.* This is a heavy burden of meaning to be carried by the two words 'as such', and several representatives expressed the hope that the Drafting Committee would ultimately find a clearer form of words.\"\n\nAdditionally, what military you are a part of determines how you interpret the rule (or if your country is bound by treaty or customary international law, or follows the customary international law despite being a persistent objector.) \n\nhttps://ihl-databases.icrc.org/en/customary-ihl/v1/rule54#Fn_560A1CEA_00003\n\n\"Several military manuals specify that in order to be illegal, the intent of the attack has to be to prevent the civilian population from being supplied.[9]\"\n\nFootnote 9: \"[9] - See, e.g., the military manuals of Australia (ibid., \u00a7 200), Ecuador (ibid., \u00a7 205), France (ibid., \u00a7 208), Germany (ibid., \u00a7 210), New Zealand (ibid., \u00a7 218), Spain (\u201cwith the intent to starve the civilian population\u201d) (ibid., \u00a7 221), Sweden (ibid., \u00a7 222), United States (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 226\u2013227) and Yugoslavia (ibid., \u00a7 228)\"",

The Working Group and then Committee III had adopted the words &quot;for the purpose of denying them as such&quot;[13]. The Drafting Committee finally proposed the present wording, which was adopted in the Conference by consensus.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>and </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Even if the wording is not perfect, the meaning is clear: the objects indicated must be respected in order to guarantee the survival of the population, unless \u00ad following paragraphs 3 and 5 - military necessity requires that they be attacked, destroyed, removed or rendered useless. On this subject the examples given by the Rapporteur are meaningful. 15 The restrictions laid down in Article 57 (Precautions in attack) must of course be respected.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Footnote 13:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;13 In this respect it is appropriate to quote the report of the Committee: &quot;In paragraph 2, drafting problems were posed by the fact that two of the objects listed - food-producing areas and irrigation works - might be useful to combatants for purposes other than directly for sustenance. Thus, the phrase in paragraph 2 &#39;for the purpose of denying them as such&#39; was designed to cover both the denial of food and drink as sustenance and the denial of food-producing areas and irrigation works for their contribution to the production of sustenance. On the other hand, it was not intended to cover their denial to the enemy for other purposes, including the general purpose of preventing the enemy from advancing. Thus, bombarding an area to prevent the advance through it of an enemy is permissible, whether or not the area produces food, but the deliberate destruction of food-producing areas in order to prevent the enemy from growing food on them is forbidden. <em>Similarly, destroying a field of crops in order to clear a field for fire or to prevent the enemy using it for cover is permissible, but destroying it to prevent the enemy from consuming the crops is forbidden.</em> This is a heavy burden of meaning to be carried by the two words &#39;as such&#39;, and several representatives expressed the hope that the Drafting Committee would ultimately find a clearer form of words.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, what military you are a part of determines how you interpret the rule (or if your country is bound by treaty or customary international law, or follows the customary international law despite being a persistent objector.) </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/en/customary-ihl/v1/rule54#Fn_560A1CEA_00003\">https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/en/customary-ihl/v1/rule54#Fn_560A1CEA_00003</a></p>\n\n<p>&quot;Several military manuals specify that in order to be illegal, the intent of the attack has to be to prevent the civilian population from being supplied.[9]&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Footnote 9: &quot;[9] - See, e.g., the military manuals of Australia (ibid., \u00a7 200), Ecuador (ibid., \u00a7 205), France (ibid., \u00a7 208), Germany (ibid., \u00a7 210), New Zealand (ibid., \u00a7 218), Spain (\u201cwith the intent to starve the civilian population\u201d) (ibid., \u00a7 221), Sweden (ibid., \u00a7 222), United States (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 226\u2013227) and Yugoslavia (ibid., \u00a7 228)&quot;</p>\n</div>",
