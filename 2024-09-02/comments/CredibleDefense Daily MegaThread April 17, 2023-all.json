Sisi instructed his subordinates to keep the project secret \u201cto avoid problems with the West,\u201d the document said.\n\n>But the new documents, which The Washington Post obtained from a trove of material allegedly posted on Discord by a member of the Massachusetts Air National Guard, appear to show Sisi in early March backing away from plans to supply Moscow, a move that would have represented a major rebuke to Cairo\u2019s most generous Western ally, the United States.\n\n>Egypt, though it has a long-standing diplomatic and military relationship with Russia, has for decades been a principal American ally in the Middle East and receives more than $1 billion a year in U.S. military aid.\nIn an apparent diplomatic win for the Biden administration, a new leaked document stated that Egypt shelved the Moscow deal and approved selling 152mm and 155mm artillery rounds to the United States for transfer to Ukraine.\n\n>Washington has sought to enlist new supporters \u2014 and desperately needed ammunition \u2014 for Kyiv\u2019s fight against Russian forces. Egypt intended to use its capacity to produce weapons for Ukraine as \u201cleverage\u201d to obtain advanced U.S. military items, the document said.\n\n> The documents do not indicate whether Cairo later revived the Moscow plan or whether it has yet supplied the United States with the ammunition for Ukraine.\n\n>The Post earlier reported that Egypt has denied producing rockets for Russia, and a U.S. government official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to address sensitive information, told The Post there was no indication Egypt had executed the plan.\n\n>Presented with the new documents, a spokesman for the Egyptian Foreign Ministry did not respond to a request for comment on the leaked materials. After the initial report on Russian rocket production, Egyptian state-run media reported that officials denied the claim, saying it had \u201cno basis in truth.\u201d\nA senior Biden administration official said, \u201cEgypt is a close partner and we are regularly engaged with its leadership on a host of regional and global issues.\u201d\n\n>The United States faces challenges ramping up its own production of artillery shells and other items needed in Ukraine and has sought help from partner nations worldwide in advance of what U.S. officials predict will be challenging spring fighting season. Conversely, Washington has slapped sanctions on its adversary Iran over shipments of arms to Russia and issued warnings to China against doing the same.\nOne Western ambassador in Cairo said the leaks suggest Egypt \u201cunderestimated the U.S. response to a possible arms supply to Russia\u201d and wanted to \u201cmaximize their benefit from both sides.\u201d\n\n>The top-secret documents \u2014 informed in part by signals intelligence, or eavesdropping \u2014 detail a month of intelligence reports from early February to early March and were intended for top Pentagon officials.\n\n>**The first, dated Feb. 17, reports that Egypt took steps in late January and early February to secretly supply rockets to Russia, including setting a price and making plans for obtaining brass to make the rockets. In a conversation on Jan. 31, Minister of State for Military Production Mohamed Salah al-Din told Sisi that he advised Russian delegates that their agreed price of $1,100 per unit could rise to $1,500 due to a potential increase in brass prices. The Russians were ready to \u201cbuy anything,\u201d he told Sisi. The Egyptian president also told Salah al-Din, according to the document, to request \u201cspecialized equipment\u201d from Russia to improve the accuracy of the rockets or the quality of the Egyptian factories making them.**\n\n>**A second and undated document, likely from mid-February, states that Egypt began creating a rocket production line for the Russian military. Russian delegates had requested to purchase 15,000 rockets at the $1,100 unit price, the document states, but Sisi ordered subordinates to purchase the necessary materials to produce up to 40,000.**\n\n>Like Ukraine\u2019s army, Russian forces have expended enormous amounts of weaponry in the grinding war and need resupply.\n\n>**Egypt\u2019s president appears to have put a stop to the rocket plan following visits from U.S. officials, including Brett McGurk and Barbara Leaf, the top White House and State Department officials for Middle East issues, who traveled to Cairo in late February, and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who visited in early March.**\n\n>The Wall Street Journal reported that month that Austin asked Egyptian leaders to provide Ukraine artillery rounds during their talks in Cairo but got no clear agreement. But an intelligence document dated March 9, the **day after Austin\u2019s visit, states that Egypt had approved selling 152mm and 155mm artillery rounds to the United States for transfer to Ukraine.**\n\n>That document, part of a daily intelligence update for senior Pentagon leaders, said that **Egypt planned to use the U.S. request for ammunition to push Washington for a long-term military aid deal and to obtain specific American equipment, including F-35 stealth fighter jets and Patriot air defense systems.**\n\n>The document said that Egypt would require American help for establishing a production line for the shells, a licensing agreement and raw materials.\n\n>Austin\u2019s visit is the subject of another document, apparently from mid-March, that summarizes conversations between Sisi and two senior officials on March 8, the day the Egyptian president and the U.S. defense secretary held talks in Cairo.\n\n>In the March 8 conversations, Sisi appeared to suspect the possibility his discussions were being surveilled and issued Defense Minister Mohamed Zaki what the document described as a warning to \u201c\u2018be careful\u2019 about discussing presumably military requests from other countries, like Russia.\u201d He and Zaki referenced \u201cmilitary contracts\u201d with Russia but did not explicitly reference the rocket production plan, the document reported.\n\n>Zaki told Sisi that plans for an Egyptian delegation to travel to Russia on March 12 or 13, when they would likely sign contracts, had been postponed \u201cuntil the situation is clearer\u201d following Austin\u2019s visit. Sisi said that \u201ccaution was warranted to avoid Egypt getting into trouble unnecessarily,\u201d to which Zaki responded that \u201cwe have not taken any measures\u201d and that Egypt had not signed any contracts.",

It will assess who has access to sensitive information across the world and seek to strike the balance between ensuring that the military and civilians have information needed to do their jobs but only what they need to know she said. \n\n>The FBI arrested Jack Teixeira on Thursday in connection with the leak of highly classified documents including maps, intelligence updates and the assessment of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. The US charged Teixeira with the massive disclosure of intelligence secrets, an embarrassment that prompted President Joe Biden to pledge the administration will clamp down on the spread of classified material and led investigators to probe whether foreign adversaries played any role in the leak and the dissemination of the material.\n\n>John Kirby, spokesman for the National Security Council, told reporters that Biden directed a \u201chigh-priority\u201d process including \u201cdedicated vigorous efforts by the Department of Defense and the intelligence community, working literally around the clock to identify potentially classified material that had been disclosed.\u201d\n\n>While the FBI and Justice Department are leading the criminal investigation, Singh said the Pentagon\u2019s internal review may make recommendations on whether additions should be made to the background checks that every security clearance holder must go through, she added. \n\n>Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said last week that he\u2019s directing Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security Ronald Moultrie to lead a review into access to intelligence, accountability and control procedures within the Pentagon \u201cto inform our efforts to prevent this kind of incident from happening again.\u201d\n\n>The Defense Department is also working with social media outlets in an effort to obtain all documents that may have been leaked, according to Singh.\n\n>\u201cThere could be more documents that are circulating online,\u201d she said. \n\n>The leak of dozens of pages of documents has been described as one of the most damaging intelligence disclosures in a decade, and raised the question of how a young, relatively junior National Guard member was able to access US assessments of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, amid other information. The documents were shared among a small group on the Discord text and video chat app before being picked up and circulated more broadly on the Russia-owned Telegram messaging service. Attorney General Merrick Garland said Friday that the US wanted the charges against Teixeira to make others think twice before sharing secrets.",

The US charged Teixeira with the massive disclosure of intelligence secrets, an embarrassment that prompted President Joe Biden to pledge the administration will clamp down on the spread of classified material and led investigators to probe whether foreign adversaries played any role in the leak and the dissemination of the material.</p>\n\n<p>John Kirby, spokesman for the National Security Council, told reporters that Biden directed a \u201chigh-priority\u201d process including \u201cdedicated vigorous efforts by the Department of Defense and the intelligence community, working literally around the clock to identify potentially classified material that had been disclosed.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>While the FBI and Justice Department are leading the criminal investigation, Singh said the Pentagon\u2019s internal review may make recommendations on whether additions should be made to the background checks that every security clearance holder must go through, she added. </p>\n\n<p>Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said last week that he\u2019s directing Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security Ronald Moultrie to lead a review into access to intelligence, accountability and control procedures within the Pentagon \u201cto inform our efforts to prevent this kind of incident from happening again.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The Defense Department is also working with social media outlets in an effort to obtain all documents that may have been leaked, according to Singh.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThere could be more documents that are circulating online,\u201d she said. </p>\n\n<p>The leak of dozens of pages of documents has been described as one of the most damaging intelligence disclosures in a decade, and raised the question of how a young, relatively junior National Guard member was able to access US assessments of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, amid other information. The documents were shared among a small group on the Discord text and video chat app before being picked up and circulated more broadly on the Russia-owned Telegram messaging service. Attorney General Merrick Garland said Friday that the US wanted the charges against Teixeira to make others think twice before sharing secrets.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

In the case of Filatyev, he told Osechkin that he was against the war, had been sent there without his knowledge, had been witness of crimes and wanted to flee. Osechkin managed to get him a French visa, he wrote his book about the war (promising to send profits to Ukraine), and then not only kept the profits but also later admitted that he participated in war crimes against Ukrainians. Osechkin was shaken by this, he put up a facebook post saying he was thinking of stopping work at Gulagu, feeling tricked, saying Filatyev tricked him by hiding his participation in these crimes, etc.\n\nI haven't actually watched the whole video, but what I've seen I find a bit too gruesome to fully trust, although it wouldn't be the first terrible crimes in this war for sure. But the explanation of WHY they would say this I can think of is that Osechkin might have \"duped them\"? Like, told them he wouldn't release this, that he'd get them visas, and ended up pushing them to confess and then shared it? Such behaviour would be somewhat \"shocking\" of Osechkin though, as I think he does enjoy a certain trust for his work.. On his facebook page he says they confessed and makes it look like they accepted the publication, and he warns that if anything happens to them now, everyone will know it's Prigozhin, but that's unlikely to stop him. If it's all real, it's also possible that it's just plain guilt and anger at having been tricked by Prigozhin into doing horrible things. Osechkin also explains the publication by his opposition to the Russian carceral system and its use by Wagner. I haven't watched the full video though, so can't really say much more.\n\nI doubt it's an elaborate setup by the FSB because the risks for those behind it would be huge, especially now that relations between the MOD and Wagner are better; it could potentially hurt Wagner as much as it could hurt the overall war effort and I don't think the latter would be so easily excused. And I'm sure there will be at least legal consequences for the interviewees (if they are still in Russia). At the same time, although I know that there's no real limit to the war crimes Wagner is ready to do, I do have a hard time believing all the confessed facts are true, it just seems incredibly abhorrent and a bit unnecessarily so..",

Macron also infuriated allies last year after he said allies shouldn\u2019t \u201chumiliate\u201d Russia. \n\n>It\u2019s not clear if Macron has support for his plan from Kyiv and its allies, many of whom have dismissed cease-fire proposals that would allow Russia to keep territorial gains. Many nations are also skeptical that China can serve as a neutral intermediary given its \u201cno-limits friendship\u201d with Russia. The countries have repeatedly pledged to strengthen ties, including a call on Monday to boost cooperation between their militaries.  \n\n>An official from Macron\u2019s office confirmed the plan for Bonne to speak to Wang but declined to comment on the details, adding that France\u2019s allies have been informed of any French initiative. In response to questions, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry said it was unaware of the source of the information and \u201cdifficult to verify the authenticity.\u201d\n\n>**Spring Offensive**\n\n>Any future negotiations would be dependent on several conditions, including a successful Ukrainian spring offensive that would put Kyiv in a position of strength during any talks, according to the people. \nSome European officials worry that dangerously high expectations have been placed on any Ukrainian counteroffensive, which may not be decisive enough for Kyiv to liberate all the territory Russia has occupied. A more realistic target is a 30 kilometer (20 mile) or so advance in the south that would put Ukraine\u2019s most capable artillery within range of Russian supply lines and create the conditions for a deeper push in 2024, Bloomberg previously reported.\n\n>This means Ukraine\u2019s allies would need to ramp up support to enable future offensives to win back more occupied territory or that any potential ceasefire negotiations before that time could see Russia remain entrenched in significant swathes of Ukrainian territory.    \n\n>Macron has previously said that he sees a major role for China and that thanks to its relationship with Russia it could \u201cbring Moscow back to reason.\u201d Beijing so far hasn\u2019t shown signs that it\u2019s willing to pressure Moscow to withdraw troops.\n\n>Top diplomats from the Group of Seven nations \u2014 including France \u2014 this week endorsed Zelenskiy\u2019s \u201cPeace Formula,\u201d which includes the complete withdrawal of all Russian troops from Ukrainian territory. \n\n>Kyiv has repeatedly said that territorial concessions shouldn\u2019t be on the table and several of Ukraine\u2019s allies back that position, warning that any settlement that essentially freezes the war would likely see Russia rearm before starting another offensive.\n\n>For his part, Russian President Vladimir Putin has provided little indication to suggest his objectives have changed, let alone that he is prepared to move forces out of Ukrainian territory.  \n\n>Macron\u2019s plan would rely on long-term security assurances for Ukraine that would aim to deter Russia from future acts of aggression, according to the people. Allies have yet to spell out the specifics of the measures due to be agreed at a NATO leaders\u2019 summit in Lithuania in July, but will aim to help Ukraine modernize its armed forces and become more interoperable with NATO militaries.\n\n>In parallel, Ukraine\u2019s allies are also working on ways to sustain the ongoing provision of weapons and key supplies, such as 155mm rounds of ammunition, one of the people said.",
