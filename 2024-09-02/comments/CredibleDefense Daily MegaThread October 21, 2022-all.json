The US does not want to start up production lines for munitions that the US military does not use, so it looks to buy what they can from countries using similar equipment like Pakistan.

The US does not want to start up production lines for munitions that the US military does not use, so it looks to buy what they can from countries using similar equipment like Pakistan. It doesn&#39;t need the industrial capacity of a wartime economy just to produce munitions for non-NATO weapons (e.g. upgraded or derived from Soviet).</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I realize you&#39;re now referring to NATO munitions within this comment. I still believe you underestimate the scale of a wartime economy. The executive can request more far more funding before the need arises.

We understand they are short of cannon fodder, and we understand their equipment is defective,\" said Fugas, 38, the nom de guerre of the commander of the 600-man unit deployed in the southern province of Mykolaiv, bordering Kherson.\n\n>The Russians \"are constantly suffering losses in this sector, and we're trying to do everything we can so they leave this place as fast as possible,\" continued Fugas, a stocky man who in civilian life co-owned an agricultural business in the western Lviv region.\n\n>Ukrainian forces began moving in August to reclaim Kherson, a strategically important ship-building centre on the sprawling Dnipro River. In recent weeks, they have driven the Russians back 20-30 kms (13-20 miles) on parts of the battlefront.\n\n>Kherson province is one of four partially occupied regions that Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sept. 30 proclaimed part of Russia, the largest annexation of territory in Europe since World War Two.\n\n>Three weeks later, there are signs that the Ukrainian drive may be forcing Putin to concede ground in Kherson and pull his forces back to the Dnipro's southern bank.\n\n>Russian-appointed occupation authorities this week began evacuating thousands of civilians from Kherson to the southern bank, denounced by Kyiv as forced deportations.\n\n>Sergei Surovikin, an air force general tapped this month to command Russia's invasion forces, conceded this week that the Kherson situation was \"very difficult\" and Moscow was \"not ruling out difficult decisions.\"\n\n>The sector of the front visited by Reuters on Friday was largely quiet.\n\n>The occasional crump of an exploding artillery shell sounded across flat fields. Flocks of partridges shot from bushes and long-legged herons stood in ponds near tiny villages that have been devastated by shellfire.\n\n>The Ukrainian unit was deployed in trenches dug into one of the countless tree lines that divide the fields, difficult terrain for the Russians to defend against well-armed determined troops backed by long-range artillery and heavy armour.\n\n>The Russians \"have been shooting less since about three weeks ago,\" said Myhailo, 42, who like the other soldiers withheld his last name. \"And their drones are less active.\"\n\n>\"It's probably been about a month that there's been less shelling,\" agreed Sasha, 19. \"This has to finish at some point. Their ammunition can't last forever.\"\n\n>It was unclear how widespread that trend was across the southern front. Ukrainian military rules prohibited the identification of the unit and its location.\n\n>The men were relaxed, chatting and smoking as they sat on car seats and tree stumps outside bunkers and dugouts gouged into the hard earth. Their mascot, a German shepherd named Odin, lounged by an assault rifle, yawning deeply.\n\n>The troops said that they would not allow the Russians to retreat without a fight.\n\n>\"We're not going to help them,\" vowed Myhailo, who worked in civilian life as a welder in the Lviv region, where the unit is based. \"Do they think they can just come here and leave? You can't just break into someone's house and go.\"",

In recent weeks, they have driven the Russians back 20-30 kms (13-20 miles) on parts of the battlefront.</p>\n\n<p>Kherson province is one of four partially occupied regions that Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sept. 30 proclaimed part of Russia, the largest annexation of territory in Europe since World War Two.</p>\n\n<p>Three weeks later, there are signs that the Ukrainian drive may be forcing Putin to concede ground in Kherson and pull his forces back to the Dnipro&#39;s southern bank.</p>\n\n<p>Russian-appointed occupation authorities this week began evacuating thousands of civilians from Kherson to the southern bank, denounced by Kyiv as forced deportations.</p>\n\n<p>Sergei Surovikin, an air force general tapped this month to command Russia&#39;s invasion forces, conceded this week that the Kherson situation was &quot;very difficult&quot; and Moscow was &quot;not ruling out difficult decisions.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The sector of the front visited by Reuters on Friday was largely quiet.</p>\n\n<p>The occasional crump of an exploding artillery shell sounded across flat fields. Flocks of partridges shot from bushes and long-legged herons stood in ponds near tiny villages that have been devastated by shellfire.</p>\n\n<p>The Ukrainian unit was deployed in trenches dug into one of the countless tree lines that divide the fields, difficult terrain for the Russians to defend against well-armed determined troops backed by long-range artillery and heavy armour.</p>\n\n<p>The Russians &quot;have been shooting less since about three weeks ago,&quot; said Myhailo, 42, who like the other soldiers withheld his last name. &quot;And their drones are less active.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s probably been about a month that there&#39;s been less shelling,&quot; agreed Sasha, 19. &quot;This has to finish at some point. Their ammunition can&#39;t last forever.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>It was unclear how widespread that trend was across the southern front. Ukrainian military rules prohibited the identification of the unit and its location.</p>\n\n<p>The men were relaxed, chatting and smoking as they sat on car seats and tree stumps outside bunkers and dugouts gouged into the hard earth. Their mascot, a German shepherd named Odin, lounged by an assault rifle, yawning deeply.</p>\n\n<p>The troops said that they would not allow the Russians to retreat without a fight.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We&#39;re not going to help them,&quot; vowed Myhailo, who worked in civilian life as a welder in the Lviv region, where the unit is based. &quot;Do they think they can just come here and leave? You can&#39;t just break into someone&#39;s house and go.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

                "body": "It is Russia's biggest prize to date, but the only reason they haven't abandoned it already is because of its political value. \n\nFrom a military perspective, holding Kherson city and the surrounding areas is a nightmare for Russia. There's only 2 bridges across the Dnieper (a very large river), the Antonovsky bridge which is no longer traversible by heavy vehicles and the Nova Khakova bridge which is narrow and a major choke point. Russia gets most of its supplies across by barges, which are also major choke points that get targeted regularly by Ukraine. \n\nBesides the logistical nightmare, Russian territory on the West bank of the river has been shrinking over the past few months, forcing their troops into an ever smaller amount of territory, making the area more target rich for Ukrainian fires. Russia is also largely unable to field air defenses and artillery on that side of the river as they are easy targets for Ukrainian fires. This means that Ukrainian aircraft and artillery are able to operate more freely with less of a risk of attack, while the inverse is true for Russian forces. Ukrainian forces are also pushing towards that bridge at Nova Khakova, and if they can get within artillery range, life will get even harder for Russian forces. \n\nTaken altogether, it means that Russian forces on the Western side of the Dnieper are likely undersupplied, lacking in artillery and air defense coverage, suffering significant attrition from Ukrainian long range fires, and perhaps most importantly, getting squeezed up against a major river. If Russian forces don't pull back sooner than later, they might get trapped on that side of the river and we could see large scale surrenders of Russian units in addition to large quantities of lost materiel.

However, their officers corps (who run the UAF)  would have done many, especially from captain and higher. \n\nThe UAF have taken high casualties but unlikely the type that would cause the majority to have been hollowed out of their original prewar forces at the company level and under. Some have, and all have likely taken some pretty heavy casualties, but I seriously doubt they are close to what the Russians have experienced, which is a nightmare when manning and reconstitution is considered. \n\nTo win the tactical fight, the Ukrainians don't need to be great, they just need to be better than the Russians.

So for a lot of the initial batches, maybe the training was poor but if they've survived this long they likely have a ton of combat experience to make up for it. This is where the casualties and the hollow vs. not hollow debate comes in.

So you have a lot of guys with a lot of experience hanging around, even if they may not have had the best pre-war training or experience.

The Ukrainian basic + western 5 week courses model seems like a helpful booster, but just a bandaid. Then you have the specialist training, which would be a great opportunity to take a former TDF grunt who mobilized in March, send him to England to learn how to be a real soldier and do a needed job, then get him home to help his unit. In the 20th century this was a real strength of the German Army, their fixation on getting privates to go home for NCO training in specialist skills. \n\nMeanwhile in the Russian Army its likely the exact opposite is happening. Casualties early in the war were extreme and uneven, based on reports some units were totally wiped out while others saw little action. Probably they hollowed out many units, and then did it again in the Donbas. So their replacements dont come in with very good training, and dont integrate in with lots of veterans.

[Under international law](https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/basic-principles-and-guidelines-right-remedy-and-reparation), victims of violations of gross violations of international human rights law are entitled to reparations. It seems morally self-evident that if a nation intentionally inflicts harm on civilians, they ought to compensate them for their damages.\n\nIn any case, international law has evolved since the Treaty of Versailles toward a more balanced paradigm. In 1919, reparations were viewed as a method for rectifying a wrong *between nations*. Now, war reparations are generally designed to compensate *individual victims* and to address the societal harms of the war, rather than to punish the aggressors or to extract punitive fines from them for the benefit of other nations. \n\n> Is there any example from history where this worked out well?\n\nYes, WW2 actually. Both East and West Germany made billions of dollars in payments to victims of the Holocaust and those who were forced to perform labor for the Nazis. Meaning, they compensated the individual victims of Nazi war crimes, whom I think we can all agree desperately needed and deserved such reparations, much as many in Ukraine do now. The Germans were able to make those payments without much trouble, so they were clearly well calibrated to avoid a repeat of Versailles while also ensuring that those who suffered the most egregious harms were at least partially compensated (I'm not sure there is really anyway to truly compensate the victims of the Holocaust without a time machine).  \n\nThe Germans also paid for the costs of the occupying Allied forces after the war, although this was probably more than offset by the reduced need to fund their own military for self-defense purposes during the immediate post-war era. Notably the Allies basically stripped German industry during the early days of the occupation, removing equipment from factories and confiscating rail infrastructure and merchant marine ships, which could have crushed Germany's recovery in much the same way that the crushing Versailles reparations had in the previous two decades. But the western Allies quickly realized this was a bad idea and pivoted to the Marshall Plan, while the Soviet Union continued to extract raw resources and other material from East Germany until the mid-1950s, which helps explain at least some of the divergent economic trajectories the two halves of the nation followed over the subsequent three decades. \n\nSo I think the lesson we can take is that individual victims should be compensated by the offending nation, simply because that is what any reasonable sense of justice demands and it is generally affordable for a nation capable of inflicting these harms at scale, but that there should be a corresponding effort to rebuild the offending nation's infrastructure and society in a way that make it possible to move forward to avoid triggering a culture resentment similar to that which reparations caused in Wiemar Germany and which helped fuel the rise of the Nazis.",

            "body": "The primary purpose of armor is not to hold ground or provide fire support, but to concentrate firepower and use shock to achieve a breakthrough and have the mobility to exploit it. Mechanized infantry and other mobile elements such as SPGs and SPAAGs provide support and screening in this role (the shaft of the spear, if you will), but only the tank has both the armor and firepower to be the tip of the spear that achieves this breakthrough against a fortified enemy position, and to also follow it up with exploitation.\n\nThe reason why we have seen tanks pushed into more defensive and supporting roles in Ukraine is because neither side really has the mass necessary to carry out large scale maneuver warfare while also manning such a long front line. As shocking and destructive as this war has been, its scale is still dwarfed by something like the Korean War (or WW2). However, when nations acquire tanks, that kind of classic maneuver warfare is still foremost amongst the potential usages they are envisioning. Without maneuver, all conflicts tend to devolve into attritional slogs, which usually favor the nation with the larger population and/or war industry.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>The primary purpose of armor is not to hold ground or provide fire support, but to concentrate firepower and use shock to achieve a breakthrough and have the mobility to exploit it. Mechanized infantry and other mobile elements such as SPGs and SPAAGs provide support and screening in this role (the shaft of the spear, if you will), but only the tank has both the armor and firepower to be the tip of the spear that achieves this breakthrough against a fortified enemy position, and to also follow it up with exploitation.</p>\n\n<p>The reason why we have seen tanks pushed into more defensive and supporting roles in Ukraine is because neither side really has the mass necessary to carry out large scale maneuver warfare while also manning such a long front line. As shocking and destructive as this war has been, its scale is still dwarfed by something like the Korean War (or WW2). However, when nations acquire tanks, that kind of classic maneuver warfare is still foremost amongst the potential usages they are envisioning. Without maneuver, all conflicts tend to devolve into attritional slogs, which usually favor the nation with the larger population and/or war industry.
