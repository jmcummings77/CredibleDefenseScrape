If Czechoslovakia decided unilaterally to cede the sudentenland to Germany, and it later backfired, I'm not sure many would really blame them since they were clearly outmatched. But when the UK/France, as foreign mediators, *mandate* they give up land they lost the right to self-determine policy and response. \n\nAppeasement does cover more than just ceding territory, but people focus on that aspect in these discussions because it's the most contextually relevant. The only thing which would have even begun to appease Russia (and I'm not even convinced it would have averted war, based on the maximalist war goals which we saw in the first three days of the conflict) were territorial concessions.

It is constrained by any number of international treaties,  laws and norms that govern our lives. \n\nIt is also constrained by the competing interests of other states.  As it always has been,  especially prior to said international order.\n\n> >What people mean when they say agency and a right towards self determination is that they get to control how they react to something, given the conditions that they currently face\n\nA country can always control how they react to something,  but that will then have consequences. Countries do not exist in a vacuum. \n\nThe literal purpose of the diplomatic community is to determine cause and effect.  What actions can we take? How will others respond to them? What actions might they take that we may want to respond to?\n\nThe world being discussed is one in which diplomacy doesn't exist,  and the actions of one country cannot elicit a response from another one.\n\n> They have a right to make and execute decisions about their own future.\n\nI find talk of self determination in this context honestly quite hilarious. \n\nIt's become a buzzword that people use so they can pretend they value democratic principles.  If you mention the self determination of crimea then people go completely silent or in fact completely dismiss *their* agency.  Nobody cares about self determination for the donbas.  Nor their agency.  They are of course just 'russian', and they are framed that way specifically so that people can deny their agency. Nobody cares that by law Ukraine considers self determination/seccession illegal and post maidan started demanding people be locked up for advocating *federalisation*...  Not even secession. \n\nBut yeah. 'agency and self determination'  right? So long as they're on our side I guess. \n\nI can't take this sort of discussion of 'democratic principles'  seriously,  because almost nobody I have encountered actually holds those principles. Or at least they lack the desire to apply those principles equally. It's pure rhetoric.\n\n>  notably one of the instances of successful appeasement noted in this thread is the Finnish decision to cede territory to the Soviet Union\n\nLosing a war isn't appeasement. Big respect to the Finns for holding out so long,  but they were in fact invaded and in a full scale war. \n\n> yet they still ended with a belligerent neighbor they've had to worry about existentially for the last 80 years.\n\nThis is how 'geography'  works.  Finland are in fact a perfect example of a country that post ww2 engaged in pragmatic diplomacy because they understood their situationally restricted agency. They understood that they had to get along with their much larger neighbours whether they liked them or not. \n\n> It's when appeasement is dictated to a country that problems arise.\n\nEven the classic example of appeasement - sudetenland -  isnt that clear cut. \n\nIt requires denying the agency of the sudeten Germans.... Of whom 88% voted for the sdp and who also seemingly suffered severe inequalities. It also requires denying the agency of the Czechs themselves and pretending that they had no choice.

                    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>By this definition, true agency doesn&#39;t really exist.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Correct.  Pure uncontested sovereignty does not exist.  It is constrained by any number of international treaties,  laws and norms that govern our lives. </p>\n\n<p>It is also constrained by the competing interests of other states.  As it always has been,  especially prior to said international order.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What people mean when they say agency and a right towards self determination is that they get to control how they react to something, given the conditions that they currently face</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A country can always control how they react to something,  but that will then have consequences. Countries do not exist in a vacuum. </p>\n\n<p>The literal purpose of the diplomatic community is to determine cause and effect.  What actions can we take? How will others respond to them? What actions might they take that we may want to respond to?</p>\n\n<p>The world being discussed is one in which diplomacy doesn&#39;t exist,  and the actions of one country cannot elicit a response from another one.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>They have a right to make and execute decisions about their own future.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I find talk of self determination in this context honestly quite hilarious. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s become a buzzword that people use so they can pretend they value democratic principles.  If you mention the self determination of crimea then people go completely silent or in fact completely dismiss <em>their</em> agency.  Nobody cares about self determination for the donbas.  Nor their agency.  They are of course just &#39;russian&#39;, and they are framed that way specifically so that people can deny their agency. Nobody cares that by law Ukraine considers self determination/seccession illegal and post maidan started demanding people be locked up for advocating <em>federalisation</em>...  Not even secession. </p>\n\n<p>But yeah. &#39;agency and self determination&#39;  right? So long as they&#39;re on our side I guess. </p>\n\n<p>I can&#39;t take this sort of discussion of &#39;democratic principles&#39;  seriously,  because almost nobody I have encountered actually holds those principles. Or at least they lack the desire to apply those principles equally. It&#39;s pure rhetoric.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>notably one of the instances of successful appeasement noted in this thread is the Finnish decision to cede territory to the Soviet Union</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Losing a war isn&#39;t appeasement. Big respect to the Finns for holding out so long,  but they were in fact invaded and in a full scale war. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>yet they still ended with a belligerent neighbor they&#39;ve had to worry about existentially for the last 80 years.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is how &#39;geography&#39;  works.  Finland are in fact a perfect example of a country that post ww2 engaged in pragmatic diplomacy because they understood their situationally restricted agency. They understood that they had to get along with their much larger neighbours whether they liked them or not. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It&#39;s when appeasement is dictated to a country that problems arise.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Even the classic example of appeasement - sudetenland -  isnt that clear cut. </p>\n\n<p>It requires denying the agency of the sudeten Germans.... Of whom 88% voted for the sdp and who also seemingly suffered severe inequalities. It also requires denying the agency of the Czechs themselves and pretending that they had no choice. They weren&#39;t forced to cede territory,  they were just told not to expect any support if they were invaded. </p>\n\n<p>It also requires ignoring that the poles and hungarians also forced czechoslovakia to cede them land. But they were later the victims of the germans,  so how could they be the evil aggressor state I guess?</p>\n\n<p>The situation was a diplomatic mess.

Military and war does not exist outside of politics. It is part of politics.\n\nI would argue that the decision to withdraw from Kyiv or Sievierodonetsk or the west bank of Dnepr are precisely the types of decisions that have to be politically approved. Of course battlefield realities must play a crucial role in the decision making process, but there is a whole lot non-military in wars that decide the outcome of wars. \n\nAnd battlefield realities are not absolute. The common saying about keeping men and losing land has a good point, but is extremely simplified, even to a degree that it is wrong. Battles in war are not binary. Every engagement is fought over some piece of ground and sacrificing some parts of the army. Sometimes it is worth to lose 1% of the army to keep some strategically important piece of land and sometimes it is worth to lose land to avoid losing some parts of the army. And sometimes it is worth losing parts of your army to lose land slowly. But it depends (\"is contingent\"). And wider political, economic, geopolitical factors do matter.\n\nPoliticians also play a role in allocating resources for the military. It would be feasible political decision if hypothetically Putin had decided in March/April to stay in Northern Ukraine, but due to the battlefield realities Russia declared a general mobilization to make the Northern action militarily achievable. Obviously such political decision was not taken and therefore the military reality dictated the need to withdraw. But saying that the decision should have been purely military and not political is obviously faulty.",

It is part of politics.</p>\n\n<p>I would argue that the decision to withdraw from Kyiv or Sievierodonetsk or the west bank of Dnepr are precisely the types of decisions that have to be politically approved. Of course battlefield realities must play a crucial role in the decision making process, but there is a whole lot non-military in wars that decide the outcome of wars. </p>\n\n<p>And battlefield realities are not absolute. The common saying about keeping men and losing land has a good point, but is extremely simplified, even to a degree that it is wrong. Battles in war are not binary. Every engagement is fought over some piece of ground and sacrificing some parts of the army. Sometimes it is worth to lose 1% of the army to keep some strategically important piece of land and sometimes it is worth to lose land to avoid losing some parts of the army. And sometimes it is worth losing parts of your army to lose land slowly. But it depends (&quot;is contingent&quot;). And wider political, economic, geopolitical factors do matter.</p>\n\n<p>Politicians also play a role in allocating resources for the military. It would be feasible political decision if hypothetically Putin had decided in March/April to stay in Northern Ukraine, but due to the battlefield realities Russia declared a general mobilization to make the Northern action militarily achievable. Obviously such political decision was not taken and therefore the military reality dictated the need to withdraw. But saying that the decision should have been purely military and not political is obviously faulty.</p>\n</div>",

Some citations from the above link:\n\n> Implementation of these measures would in effect destroy Ukraine as a sovereign country. The DNR and LNR would be reincorporated into Ukraine but as distinct political, economic and legal entities tied to Russia \u2013 thus introducing a constitutional Trojan Horse that would give the Kremlin a lasting presence in Ukraine\u2019s political system and prevent the authorities in Kyiv from running the country as an integrated whole.\n> A neutrality clause in the constitution would rule out NATO accession.56 Yet the DNR and LNR would be able to sign agreements with other countries (i.e. Russia), perhaps establishing Russian military bases on their territories\n\n\nIn that sense, it doesn't seem likely that Kyiv giving away Crimea/Donetsk/Luhansk would satisfy Putin since that would also mean giving away his existing leverage over Kyiv and abandoning his larger goal of controlling the whole of Ukraine.",

The agreement (as interpreted by Russia) castrated Kyiv government while giving unusual rights to the Donetsk/Luhansk Oblasts - e.g. they could close international agreements while also vetoing deals of Kyiv (meaning no EU membership etc). Some citations from the above link:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Implementation of these measures would in effect destroy Ukraine as a sovereign country. The DNR and LNR would be reincorporated into Ukraine but as distinct political, economic and legal entities tied to Russia \u2013 thus introducing a constitutional Trojan Horse that would give the Kremlin a lasting presence in Ukraine\u2019s political system and prevent the authorities in Kyiv from running the country as an integrated whole.\nA neutrality clause in the constitution would rule out NATO accession.56 Yet the DNR and LNR would be able to sign agreements with other countries (i.e. Russia), perhaps establishing Russian military bases on their territories</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In that sense, it doesn&#39;t seem likely that Kyiv giving away Crimea/Donetsk/Luhansk would satisfy Putin since that would also mean giving away his existing leverage over Kyiv and abandoning his larger goal of controlling the whole of Ukraine.</p>\n</div>",

And we'll never know *if* they would have offered anything. Because we didn't try very hard at negotiating with them to avoid a war.\n\nYes, yes, Russia initially proposed absurd maximalist terms that we could never accept. We are not withdrawing to NATO borders ca. 1997 and retreating from the countries that joined in 1999 onward. Of course not.\n\nBut what we did was to counter their absurd maximalist terms with similarly laughable *minimalist* terms.

But then, following the war, Finlandization involved substantial Russian involvement in their political system. That certainly looks like appeasement.

For us, appeasement is when one country (or alliance) of approximately equal or greater strength makes concessions to an aggressive adversary to avoid conflict. It's not that we would certainly lose the conflict, or even likely lose the conflict, we would probably win, but it would hurt. And so we make concessions, put things off, hope the hurt never comes, and often the result is just that things eventually hurt more later on. But the decision is never really existential for us, at least not at the start of the appeasement, because we're a great power.\n\nAppeasement analysis looks different for the smaller players, especially when hung out to dry by the big players. It's a difficult tightrope to walk because too much appeasement and you get annexed, too little appeasement and you get conquered in an invasion. Following and during WW2 we saw many examples of both strategies failing, sometimes in situations where the country really had no viable options.

Donetsk, and Luhansk, are next, obviously - but then also Kharkiv, Kherson, Mykolaiv, and Odessa (<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/transcript-vladimir-putins-april-17-qanda/2014/04/17/ff77b4a2-c635-11e3-8b9a-8e0977a24aeb_story.html\">as said by Putin himself back in 2015</a>). </p>\n\n<p>&#39;Appeasement&#39; might work in cases where the beneficiary will actually be appeased - where they will be satisfied with what has been sacrificed to them. For Russia, it&#39;s half of Ukraine - engaging with that is not appeasement, it&#39;s capitulation. That&#39;s the difference between the GFA and Minsk II (or any hypothetical appeasement of Russia).</p>\n</div>",

                    "body": "How Russian elite view Belarus and how they view Ukraine is totally different IMO.\n\nUkrainian nationalism is much more potent than it's Belarusian counterparts, which makes their potential annexation more difficult. Belarusian elites were more assimilated into the dominant Russian culture than their Ukrainian equivalents; they had fewer social communication networks, such as Belarusian educational institutions or mass media resources unlike Ukraine, Belarus had no free peasantry; and until after World War II there were few railways, urban centers, or other hallmarks of socioeconomic development. Belarus was one of the poorest regions of the Tsarist Empire and prewar Soviet Union, and Jews and Poles dominated its few towns until World War II (there was no Belarusian equivalent of towns such as Poltava, which was populated by Ukrainians). By far, the most important thing Belarus lacked is a primate city (such as Lviv for Ukrainians). Compared to the role of Kyiv in Ukraine, Minsk had little historical importance, being more Soviet than Belarusian. And although Belarusians competed with Lithuanians and Poles over Vilna, that city eventually was included within Soviet Lithuania (as Vilnius), As a result, Vilna was never an equivalent of Ukraine\u2019s Galicia and Belarus never had a foreign territory that could act as an \u201cincubator\u201d of a national movement the way Galicia did for Ukrainians. Belarus lacked both strong nationalist myths and historical memory.\n\nThe existence of states such as Poland or Romania is never questioned because these states have existed for long periods of time. Even the relatively young Baltic States existed as independent countries between the World Wars, no blueprint of independent statehood exists for Belarus either, which means its independence has never been much of a concern for Europeans. Belarus is another striking case of how we use history to create trajectories towards the future: What has never existed, is unlikely to exist in the future \u2013 what has existed, can always return. Therefore, Belarus\u2019s independence is seen as an accidental by-product of the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse, and many continue to assume that the likeliest of all options is that Belarus will eventually be absorbed into Russia. For this reason, there has also been relatively little support in the West for Belarusian dissidents.\n\nI think Putin will try to integrate Belarusian insititutions into Russia but he has accepted the fact Ukraine has become independent from Russia for good. In his July 12, 2021, article about Russian-Ukrainian relations, he tells the Ukrainian people, **\u201cYou want to establish a state of your own: you are welcome!\u201d** Regarding how Russia should treat Ukraine, he writes, **\u201cThere is only one answer: with respect.\u201d** He concludes that lengthy article with the following words: **\u201cAnd what Ukraine will be\u2014it is up to its citizens to decide.\u201d** I think he was more interested in making sure Ukraine  did not become a \u201cspringboard\u201c for the West against Russia. In that same July 12, 2021, article and again in an important speech he gave on February 21st of this year, Putin emphasized that Russia accepts \u201c**the new geopolitical reality that took shape after the dissolution of the USSR.\u201d**",
                    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>How Russian elite view Belarus and how they view Ukraine is totally different IMO.</p>\n\n<p>Ukrainian nationalism is much more potent than it&#39;s Belarusian counterparts, which makes their potential annexation more difficult. Belarusian elites were more assimilated into the dominant Russian culture than their Ukrainian equivalents; they had fewer social communication networks, such as Belarusian educational institutions or mass media resources unlike Ukraine, Belarus had no free peasantry; and until after World War II there were few railways, urban centers, or other hallmarks of socioeconomic development. Belarus was one of the poorest regions of the Tsarist Empire and prewar Soviet Union, and Jews and Poles dominated its few towns until World War II (there was no Belarusian equivalent of towns such as Poltava, which was populated by Ukrainians). By far, the most important thing Belarus lacked is a primate city (such as Lviv for Ukrainians). Compared to the role of Kyiv in Ukraine, Minsk had little historical importance, being more Soviet than Belarusian. And although Belarusians competed with Lithuanians and Poles over Vilna, that city eventually was included within Soviet Lithuania (as Vilnius), As a result, Vilna was never an equivalent of Ukraine\u2019s Galicia and Belarus never had a foreign territory that could act as an \u201cincubator\u201d of a national movement the way Galicia did for Ukrainians. Belarus lacked both strong nationalist myths and historical memory.</p>\n\n<p>The existence of states such as Poland or Romania is never questioned because these states have existed for long periods of time. Even the relatively young Baltic States existed as independent countries between the World Wars, no blueprint of independent statehood exists for Belarus either, which means its independence has never been much of a concern for Europeans. Belarus is another striking case of how we use history to create trajectories towards the future: What has never existed, is unlikely to exist in the future \u2013 what has existed, can always return. Therefore, Belarus\u2019s independence is seen as an accidental by-product of the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse, and many continue to assume that the likeliest of all options is that Belarus will eventually be absorbed into Russia. For this reason, there has also been relatively little support in the West for Belarusian dissidents.</p>\n\n<p>I think Putin will try to integrate Belarusian insititutions into Russia but he has accepted the fact Ukraine has become independent from Russia for good.
