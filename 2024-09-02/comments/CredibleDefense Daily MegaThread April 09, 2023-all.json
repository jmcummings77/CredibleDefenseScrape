Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

The aircraft is used to collect radio transmissions and other electronic messages.\n\n>U.K. Defense Minister Ben Wallace disclosed the incident to the British House of Commons in October, saying that two Russian Su-27 fighter jets had intercepted the RC-135 in international airspace over the Black Sea, flying \"recklessly,\" with one plane coming within 15 feet of the British aircraft.\n\n>One of the Russian jets \"released a missile\" at a distance, Wallace told lawmakers then \u2014 but he did not describe the incident as a near-shootdown, attributed the missile launch to a \"technical malfunction,\" and said he had spoken with senior Russian defense officials about it.\n\n>The incident highlights the balancing act that Western military officials have sought to maintain as they attempt to aid the Ukrainian military and collect information about the war without being drawn directly into conflict with Moscow. Russian officials have sought to portray NATO nations as aggressors, while the United States and its allies have said they are supporting Ukraine but are not war at Russia.\n\n>Under NATO's treaty, if a member of the military alliance is a victim of an armed attack, all members of the alliance will consider it an attack and collectively respond.\n\n>U.S. defense officials declined to comment about the contents of the leaked document, as they have with other information in the trove that was found on messaging apps including Discord, Telegram and Twitter. An official with the British Embassy in Washington also declined to comment, and the Russian Embassy did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n>The document was printed with headers for the Pentagon's Joint Staff, and details surveillance flights over the Black Sea from the day of the reported near-shootdown up to Feb. 26.\n\n>The document is labeled \"SECRET/NOFORN,\" a classification that indicates it is not to be shared with non-U.S. citizens. It details a number of other Russian reactions to surveillance flights by U.S., British and French aircraft between October and the end of February, including one on Dec. 30 in which another British Rivet Joint, accompanied by two British Typhoon fighter jets, was intercepted by Russian jets that came within 100 feet.\n\n>In another instance, a U.S. MQ-9 surveillance drone was intercepted on Feb. 22, with Russian aircraft coming within 100 feet. About two weeks later, on March 14, two Russian Su-27 jets intercepted an American MQ-9, dumping fuel on the unmanned aerial vehicle and eventually colliding with it. The collision prompted U.S. personnel remotely piloting the vehicle to down it in the Black Sea, about 56 miles off the coast of Crimea, U.S. officials have said.\n\n>A map on the document shows a boundary drawn over sections of the Black Sea to mark where surveillance planes may fly. It appears to begin about 12 miles off the coast of Crimea, adhering to international law. The map also includes a second line about 50 miles from the shore labeled \"SECDEF Directed Standoff,\" indicating that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin may have ordered U.S. pilots to keep aircraft farther from the peninsula.\n\n>Austin said in March that the United States will continue to fly \"wherever international law allows,\" rejecting Moscow's claim to a self-declared exclusion zone over extended parts of the Black Sea.\n\n>French and British aircraft made crewed surveillance flights over the Black Sea between Sept. 29 and Feb. 26, according to the document, while the Americans relied on drones that include the RQ-4 Global Hawk, the RQ-170 Sentinel and the MQ-9 Reaper. A handful of these flights occurred each month, the document said. U.S. military officials have said they typically file public flight plans for such flights.\n\n>Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in March called Russian behavior in the downing of the MQ-9 in March part of a pattern of aggressive acts toward the United States, Britain and other nations.\n\n>\"We have to figure out exactly what the way ahead is,\" he said at the time, speaking at a Pentagon news conference. He characterized the behavior of Russian pilots as \"very unprofessional and unsafe.\"\n\n>A Pentagon spokesman, Brig. Gen.

The US using them as useful pawns to bleed Russia dry because NATO is too chicken shit, otherwise they would send their own  troops to die if they really felt what Russia was doing is so abhorrent.

Why should Americans fight and suffer for the defense of Europe? It's because of ideological reasons involving the defense of the \"free world\" as well as pragmatic reasons. The US benefits economically from the stable security situation fostered by collective security, especially its predominant role in it. It's not a purely selfless proposition, even if it is motivated by ideology. Likewise, I think France would benefit economically from a stable security situation in East Asia, one best fostered by specifically deterring the PRC from initiating hostilities. From a certain perspective, it seems prudent to discourage American  warhawks, but France shouldn't trip over the line it's walking and give the PRC free rein to degrade the security situation. Fwiw, I don't think France's rhetoric here is particularly bad for itself or America, in that sense.\n\n\nAs for the allegation that the US is \"insecure\" about the rise of the PRC, pardon my bluntness, but I feel like you fundamentally misunderstand the American public's relationship with the PRC. Americans, by and large, do not like autocracies. A huge part of the national psyche is build on being one of the first modern democracies and facing down an old empire to gain independence. Sure, lots of jimmies are rustled over economic rivalry, but if China was a functional democracy not seeking to settle scores over territory while stamping out any sign of democrstic agitation, you wouldn't see America building up bases in East Asian democracies while limiting economic cooperation.",

The initial Feb-March tank run for Kyiv was defeated before meaningful amount of foreign support even arrived, and if Russia couldn't have done so back then, it sure couldn't conquer Ukraine after suffering severe losses.\n\n[Proportionally to their abilities, Central Europeans were leading aid to Ukraine](https://twitter.com/SergiyKyslytsya/status/1587401575663804416). [Poland and Czechia delivered 300 tanks, a quarter of their arsenal, as soon as they could, back in April 2022](https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/04/answering-call-heavy-weaponry-supplied.html). We're a year later and US is still mulling over delivering even tenth as many tanks (even if much better on a per-tank basis). Central Europeans sent over what combat jets they could spare, US still can't get itself to send a single F16.\n\nPoland, Czechia, Slovakia, Estonia, Lavtia, and Lithuania were key to Ukraine's early survival. US had to be dragged into this, initial US attitude was \"thoughts and prayers\", and half-assed economic sanctions.

            "body": "I don't think he's a hypocrite, I think he's just French. WW2 and the process of decolonialization were great humiliations that have been percolating in the French national psyche for generations. The nation that was once led by the Sun King, led by Napoleon himself, was conquered by the Germans and defeated time and time again by anti-colonial rebels. Worse, during the Cold War, they were reduced to play second fiddle to an Anglo-American security guarantee to protect against Soviet aggression. France would love to be a real great power again, and I don't necessarily blame them.\n\nMacron specifically had to deal with President Trump, who, like Bush, showed the naked self-interest the Anglo-American alliance is based on. In essence, Trump tried to transform NATO from a true military alliance into a protection racket. While he did lose in 2020, his opponent Biden is really old and also consistently polling at the low 40s (Harris is polling far worse). It isn't inconceivable that Trump wins, exits NATO, and leaves Europe in chaos. In that scenario, France would be foolish to get dragged into an Asian conflict, an area of the world that has had little French interest since the loss of Indochina. Any French military spending would very likely be directed to the home front in this scenario, specifically to secure the 'natural borders of France' (yes, this is an eternal desire and no, I don't think it is going away any time soon).\n\nEven assuming NATO sticks around, what's in it for France to go to war against China? Not only is China a major trading partner to Europe as a whole, but think about the following scenarios of peace following a major Pacific War: what does France get in each?\n\n1. Status Quo Ante--whatever the cost in blood and treasure, everything settles back to what it was before the bullets started flying.\n\n2. Total PRC victory. America routed, Taiwan conquered.\n\n3. Total Taiwan victory. PRC routed, Taiwan has formal independence.\n\n4. ROC comeback. PRC vanquished, ROC returns to the mainland (impossibly unlikely).\n\nWhat does France get in each scenario: financially, economically, militarily, industrially, and politically? Not much: in fact, it is a net loser for France as war would depress trade and thus depress the French economy. At the end of the war, France will still want to trade with whomever China has become. It matters little if there's a red flag flying over Beijing or a blue-and-red one.\n\nI do want to be clear that unlike Taiwan, it is in France's national interest to see Russia lose in Ukraine. If France cannot ally with Russia, then it must ally with the Americans and British (and Germans). Given that, France will remain opposed to Russia so long as NATO stands (though, as you can tell from Macron's outreach to Putin, he and the French state are very much hedging their bets and allowing all potential cards to be played).\n\nI'd also say it's hubris and naive on our part to expect (like Biden clearly does) that having a democracy is an ur-value and shared national interest for all democracies to pursue and encourage, which is especially rich coming from the US, considering that our repertoire of allies include the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the less-than-democratic Pakistan, among a coterie of many others. I'm sure Macron thinks democracies are neat, but he (like the French in 2003) isn't willing to sacrifice French blood in a global crusade for democracy.",

PRC vanquished, ROC returns to the mainland (impossibly unlikely).</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>What does France get in each scenario: financially, economically, militarily, industrially, and politically? Not much: in fact, it is a net loser for France as war would depress trade and thus depress the French economy. At the end of the war, France will still want to trade with whomever China has become. It matters little if there&#39;s a red flag flying over Beijing or a blue-and-red one.</p>\n\n<p>I do want to be clear that unlike Taiwan, it is in France&#39;s national interest to see Russia lose in Ukraine. If France cannot ally with Russia, then it must ally with the Americans and British (and Germans). Given that, France will remain opposed to Russia so long as NATO stands (though, as you can tell from Macron&#39;s outreach to Putin, he and the French state are very much hedging their bets and allowing all potential cards to be played).</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d also say it&#39;s hubris and naive on our part to expect (like Biden clearly does) that having a democracy is an ur-value and shared national interest for all democracies to pursue and encourage, which is especially rich coming from the US, considering that our repertoire of allies include the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the less-than-democratic Pakistan, among a coterie of many others. I&#39;m sure Macron thinks democracies are neat, but he (like the French in 2003) isn&#39;t willing to sacrifice French blood in a global crusade for democracy.</p>\n</div>",

Our trade is significantly imbalanced: China represents France\u2019s largest bilateral trade deficit (\u20ac29.2 billion in 2018), ahead of Germany. Investment in both directions is booming. France has a long-standing presence in China (foreign direct investment stock of \u20ac25 billion in 2017) in all sectors, including agrifood, industry, transport, urban development, major retail and financial services. More than 1,100 French companies are present in China where they employ around 570,000 people. Chinese investment in France has grown significantly in recent years (\u20ac6 billion in FDI stock). A total of 700 subsidiaries of Chinese and Hong Kong companies are set up in France and employ 45,000 people. France supports Chinese investment which creates jobs and forges long-term, balanced partnerships. The economic partnership is reflected by the consolidation of structuring industrial cooperation in civil nuclear energy and aviation (Hinkley Point C, the EPR reactor in Taishan in reprocessing and recycling nuclear waste, assembly line of the A320 and completion of the A330 in Tianjin) and its expansion to new sectors (sustainable development, health, the economics of ageing, innovation and financial services).\n\n> Scientific and technological cooperation is focused on combatting emerging infectious diseases (creation of a Pasteur Institute in Shanghai and a P4 laboratory in Wuhan accredited in January 2017) and the space industry (CFOSat (Chinese-French Oceanic SATellite) and SVOM (Space Variable Objects Monitor) satellite projects). Over 3,000 researchers from the two countries and from 600 research units cooperate within some 60 joint public research structures. In the area of artistic and cultural exchanges, the \u201cCroisements\u201d festival has become the most prominent foreign festival in China. As regards academic cooperation, 37,000 Chinese students are benefitting from student mobility in France (the second-largest group of foreign students), while there are 10,000 French students studying in China (the largest group from Europe). Cooperation on the environment and sustainable development has three priorities: climate change, sustainable urban development, and water issues. The Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement has been working in China since 2004 (24 projects). Some 140 decentralized cooperation projects are currently being undertaken by 60 French local government bodies and 47 Chinese ones, through which concrete issues of mutual interest can be addressed.\n\nThis doesn't include all the other trade that would be disrupted due to a war, of which we have to include semiconductors from Taiwan, which while it isn't a critical input in French industry, is a critical input in other European countries (like Germany's car industry). The French rely on imports from high-tech countries--a war would highly increase import costs (if the supply doesn't get disrupted entirely).\n\nReally, the question is: how highly do you value Taiwanese self-determination? Do you risk losing decades of investment and bilateral economic integration, at great risk to internal politics and economics? France and Europe already took a huge risk with Russia (with the energy crisis, which was thankfully mitigated by a combination of mild weather and copious supply from non-Russian suppliers). Signing on to a real war in Asia might be a bridge too far.\n\nAt the end of the day, I am positive Macron will give Taiwan unlimited moral support if they are attacked by the mainland. But actual, kinetic support? He and many in Europe will hem, haw, quaffle, and bunch of other synonyms before they fully commit.",

A CRPA antenna works by placing multiple small antennas on a dish. Signals are waves that travel at the speed of light. As the signal wave reaches each individual antenna at a different time, it can be visualized as a wave washing over a shore, where the shore represents the CRPA antenna. The electronics within the CRPA antenna process and differentiate the signal waves, they use the difference in time-of-arrival of the signal at the various sub-antennas to calculate the angle of arrival relative to the antenna face.

A CRPA antenna works by placing multiple small antennas on a dish. Signals are waves that travel at the speed of light. As the signal wave reaches each individual antenna at a different time, it can be visualized as a wave washing over a shore, where the shore represents the CRPA antenna. The electronics within the CRPA antenna process and differentiate the signal waves, they use the difference in time-of-arrival of the signal at the various sub-antennas to calculate the angle of arrival relative to the antenna face.

        "body": "When we talk about the forthcoming Ukrainian offensive we keep thinking along the old lines - an artillery preparation followed by an infantry assault supported by tanks, followed by a mechanised exploitation of the breakthrough. This is unlikely to work against an echeloned defence with plenty of mines, ATGMs and artillery, plus the artillery power multiplied by constant drone observation.\n\nBut let's try to apply the paradigm shift of this war to the offensive.

Then, on the day of the attack, you launch an all-out effort, achieving total video coverage of your frontline. You can direct kamikaze attacks on request by your infantry against any point of stubborn resistance - FPV drones against machine guns, groups of soldiers or vehicles, bigger Shahed drones against larger targets.\n\nOnce (and if) the enemy air defence is suppressed you could start operating your Bayraktar-equivalents with guided munitions over the frontline and make a coordinated defence even more difficult.",
