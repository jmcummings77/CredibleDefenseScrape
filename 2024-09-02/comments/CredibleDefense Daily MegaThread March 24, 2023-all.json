They seem neither committed to the decisive thrust needed to properly seal off Bakhmut, nor the frontal assaults needed to actually dislodge the defenders. IMO this hedging of their strategy leads to them having the worst of both worlds.\n\nIt reminds me a lot of what was happening in Severodonetsk. Perhaps this is the best tactics that one can do with limited armor and a whole lot of artillery; Push into relatively uncontested areas around a stronghold, thereby creating a salient around which a whole lot of artillery can be positioned. Then, one can use this artillery advantage to interdict enemy supplies, inflict damage on potential counterattacks, or shell the enemy exposed by reconnaissance-in-force. \n\nThe problem is that the artillery advantage of Russia has severely eroded since then, so actions like this can become counterproductive. Salients created by pushing between strongholds can be targeted by enemy artillery, and are probably more vulnerable than the defenders camping out in the city. If Ukraine is really inflicting vastly more casualties on Russia, I predict that they're primarily inflicted in the salients around Bakhmut.\n\nIt's also possible that I'm just reading into Russian actions way too much. The current state of the frontline around Bakhmut could also be explained by Russia just attacking along the line and advancing where defenders retreated.",

Last fall\u2019s call-up shook public confidence and triggered an exodus of as many as a million Russians from the country.\n\n>Even with the battlefield and political challenges, Putin has signaled he\u2019s confident Russia will be able to outlast Ukraine\u2019s supporters in the US and Europe, betting that if his forces are able to prevent another breakthrough by Ukrainian troops in the coming months, backing for Kyiv will weaken. \n\n>While many in the government and Kremlin elite question whether Russia can ever prevail, hardline security-service officials are committed to pursuing a fight they see as existential and have Putin\u2019s ear, the people said.\n\n>Defying efforts by Washington and its allies to isolate him, Putin won strong public backing this month from Chinese President Xi Jinping, who pledged to tighten ties on a visit to Moscow. Privately, Kremlin officials were upbeat about the visit despite the lack of deals announced, saying Xi\u2019s high-profile endorsement was an important sign of support.\n\n>China hasn\u2019t publicly committed to supply lethal aid, even as Russia\u2019s forces have struggled to advance in the face of fierce Ukrainian resistance. Nearly all of the 300,000 troops mobilized in the fall are now on the battlefield, according to Ukrainian and western officials, but Russia hasn\u2019t managed to take any major towns in recent months.\n\n>Ukraine, meanwhile, is planning to launch a major counteroffensive in the coming months with troops fresh from training in Europe and the US and using newly supplied tanks, armored vehicles and other weapons. Kyiv may seek to break through Russian lines and sever the land bridge of occupied territory that now links Crimea to the Russian mainland, according to US officials.\n\n>To replenish and expand its ranks, Russia has already begun the recruiting campaign for contract soldiers, who serve for terms up to several years for pay. Regional officials have been given quotas for recruiting and are issuing summonses to potential volunteers to come to draft boards, where they are pitched on signing up, according to people familiar with the efforts. Initially, authorities are targeting veterans and rural residents, they said.\n\n>But some officials said the goal of attracting 400,000 contract soldiers this year is likely to be unrealistic.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-24/russia-seeks-to-recruit-400-000-contract-soldiers-to-outlast-ukraine-supporters\">Russia Seeks 400,000 More Recruits as Latest Ukraine Push Stalls</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Kremlin worries a new mobilization would be politically unpopular, dials back plans for offensive.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Kremlin has dialed back plans for a further offensive in Ukraine this spring after failing to gain much ground and will focus on blunting a new push by Kyiv\u2019s forces expected to begin soon. </p>\n\n<p>Digging in for a long fight, the Kremlin is seeking to sign up as many as 400,000 contract soldiers this year to replenish its ranks, according to people familiar with the planning who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss matters that aren\u2019t public.</p>\n\n<p>The ambitious recruiting campaign would allow the Kremlin to avoid another forced mobilization of reservists as it ramps up the campaign to re-elect President Vladimir Putin later this year, the people said. Last fall\u2019s call-up shook public confidence and triggered an exodus of as many as a million Russians from the country.</p>\n\n<p>Even with the battlefield and political challenges, Putin has signaled he\u2019s confident Russia will be able to outlast Ukraine\u2019s supporters in the US and Europe, betting that if his forces are able to prevent another breakthrough by Ukrainian troops in the coming months, backing for Kyiv will weaken. </p>\n\n<p>While many in the government and Kremlin elite question whether Russia can ever prevail, hardline security-service officials are committed to pursuing a fight they see as existential and have Putin\u2019s ear, the people said.</p>\n\n<p>Defying efforts by Washington and its allies to isolate him, Putin won strong public backing this month from Chinese President Xi Jinping, who pledged to tighten ties on a visit to Moscow. Privately, Kremlin officials were upbeat about the visit despite the lack of deals announced, saying Xi\u2019s high-profile endorsement was an important sign of support.</p>\n\n<p>China hasn\u2019t publicly committed to supply lethal aid, even as Russia\u2019s forces have struggled to advance in the face of fierce Ukrainian resistance. Nearly all of the 300,000 troops mobilized in the fall are now on the battlefield, according to Ukrainian and western officials, but Russia hasn\u2019t managed to take any major towns in recent months.</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine, meanwhile, is planning to launch a major counteroffensive in the coming months with troops fresh from training in Europe and the US and using newly supplied tanks, armored vehicles and other weapons. Kyiv may seek to break through Russian lines and sever the land bridge of occupied territory that now links Crimea to the Russian mainland, according to US officials.</p>\n\n<p>To replenish and expand its ranks, Russia has already begun the recruiting campaign for contract soldiers, who serve for terms up to several years for pay. Regional officials have been given quotas for recruiting and are issuing summonses to potential volunteers to come to draft boards, where they are pitched on signing up, according to people familiar with the efforts. Initially, authorities are targeting veterans and rural residents, they said.</p>\n\n<p>But some officials said the goal of attracting 400,000 contract soldiers this year is likely to be unrealistic. That\u2019s roughly equal to the total number of professional troops Russia had before the invasion was launched on Feb. 24, 2022. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cIn the present circumstances I don\u2019t think that they\u2019re going to entice people to join, except for maybe the die-hard patriots, or people who are out of economic opportunities,\u201d said Dara Massicot, a senior policy researcher at the RAND Corp., and a former analyst of Russian military capabilities at the US Defense Department. \u201cI don\u2019t see it\u2019s possible for them to do another large push into Ukraine unless they move toward a wartime economy and martial law.\u201d </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That\u2019s something the Kremlin so far isn\u2019t ready to do, especially ahead of the elections next spring in which Putin is expected to seek a fifth term, according to people familiar with the situation.

My opinion, after reading Tatarigami_UA's thread, was that there is nothing particularly interesting about Wagner's tactics](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/118xtw9/credibledefense_daily_megathread_february_22_2023/j9k5199/). Tatarigami_UA's thread just described Wagner's forces as having an overwhelming advantage in equipment: they possessed artillery, machine guns, AGS, and RPGs to suppress Ukrainian troops, while the Ukrainians lacked such resources. That's it! The tactics were irrelevant.\n\n[I even asked](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/118xtw9/credibledefense_daily_megathread_february_22_2023/j9kqlzt/):\n\n> My question is: in a situation, as described in that Twitter thread, **why can't Ukrainian troops do what Wagner does - use a drone to carry out artillery/mortar strikes on the Wagner group hiding in that treeline** for a few days? Afterward, Ukrainians could do an assault on what remains of Wagner (after a few days' worths of artillery/mortar work) and use their own machine guns, AGS, and RPGs to suppress Wagner troops that are exposed and weakened by a few days of **artillery fire without the benefit of a trench to protect them**?\n\nToday's video shows the exact situation I described earlier: what if, instead of Wagner's forces having artillery and drones, it is the Ukrainians who get the artillery advantage?\n\n---\n\nAdditionally, the video demonstrates how extremely efficient and powerful drone-corrected artillery can be. Sure, the ordinary unguided shells may not have the 1-5 meter CEP of an Excalibur shell, but they are accurate enough when used with a drone. There is a world of difference between using artillery based on the approximate coordinates of enemy troops versus employing drone-corrected artillery fire. It turns out that commercial drones act as a 100x multiplier for artillery and mortar fire, offering a low-tech solution that even North Koreans could potentially pull off.\n\nDrone-corrected fires is a little game changer, it is the primary reason why Ukraine is requesting millions of artillery shells. It turns out that, given the current state of the war, drone-corrected artillery surpasses every other tactic or approach. If one side has a spotter drone and artillery within range, nothing else matters \u2013 tanks barely make a difference, IFVs offer little help, the receiving side just gets annihilated.",

I don't understand what is new or special about Wagner's tactics as described by Tatarigami_UA. To me, the thread reads like this: Wagner assault units had drone + artillery/AGS, hence drone-corrected long-range fires. The Ukrainians in the trenches, according to the thread, didn't have that. As a result, the Ukrainians lost that particular battle.\n\nFor example, I wouldn't have an issue with Tatarigami_UA if he pointed out how drone corrected fires is why, in his example, Ukrnains lost. But he doesn't.\n\nSecondly, I've encountered a lot of people who simply just don't get how utilizing a drone in conjunction with artillery/tanks-as-artillery/mortars/AGS/etc, surpasses every other tactic in the current conflict. For example, I don't think maneuver warfare is as good or as viable compared to drone-corrected long-range fires. I hope Ukrainians know better than to listen to western advisers about how the maneuver warfare is going to overwhelm RU artillery.\n\nAs for Ukrainians doing it (drone+arty), of course, I even read somewhere (perhaps RUSI?) that the primary Russian units were unaware of that, only Ukrainians and D/LPR were employing the strat. As a result, the new Russian units were caught off guard and were eating shit due to the accuracy of Ukrainian artillery around Kyiv.

Because even though it\u2019s good to see that they can pull off such an accurate and disciplined barrage, it\u2019s just as important to know wether this is commonplace or an outlier.</p>\n\n<p>In any case, I hope they are at least saving the footage if not posting it. That would be an absolute gold mine for historians and military analysts after this war is over.</p>\n</div>",

First, the presence of an independent Taiwan helps reduce the ability of China to project power more broadly in the Asia-Pacific region. For one thing, it keeps Chinese submarines penned in to shallow waters making their coming and going easier to track. Second, Taiwan is a democratic and broadly pro-Western \"country\" in Asia, with close ties to Japan and South Korea, both major American allies in the region. Third, as you noted, Taiwan is a major industrial economy and has unrivaled semiconductor production at the TSMC fabs. For now at least, the loss of those fabs would be devastating to the global economy, and it's preferred for them to be destroyed rather than letting China control them directly. Fourth, America has a \"soft\" alliance with Taiwan in which the US ambiguously promises to defend them. If China were to blockade or invade Taiwan and the US not respond, it would call into question US security arrangements with countries around the world. \n\n>Second question; why does it seem a loud group of conservatives in the US view Ukraine as some sort of foreign meddling we shouldn\u2019t we be doing when Ukraine is in fact an independent and recognised country?\n\nThose are almost exclusively Trump-aligned Republicans, who are essentially reflexively opposed to anything that Democrats support. Trump himself has vaccilated on Ukraine, both touting the fact that his administration was the first to send weapons to Ukraine while also regularly heaping praise on Putin and saying the US is spending too much money on Ukraine. That's another aspect as well, the \"America First\" Trump aligned Republicans always complain that the US provides too much aid to countries abroad, instead claiming to want it to be spent in the US, while simultaneously calling efforts by the US to spend money on welfare, infrastructure repairs, and healthcare as \"socialism.\" Unfortunately these beliefs dominate the Republican voter base at this time. \n\n>What is it exactly that this group fear in China but not Russia despite one clearly engaging in a neo-imperialist manner and being more vocally threatening to the US?\n\nThere's a lot of underlying racism there in all honesty, with major echoes of the \"yellow peril\" of days gone by. It's also easy for Republicans to drum up fear of \"Communist\" China, especially since the GOP voter base skews much older than the Democratic base, and vividly remembers the Cold War. Plus a lot of far-right Republicans actually have positive views of Putin's Russia because the regime itself is far-right, and implements policies that these Republicans would like to see in the US (anti-lgbt legislation, control over the media/social media, overt mixing of church and state, openly pushing Christian values, etc) and they value the \"masculine\" way that Putin's regime portrays itself to the world as the \"defenders of traditional values.\"",

If China were to blockade or invade Taiwan and the US not respond, it would call into question US security arrangements with countries around the world. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Second question; why does it seem a loud group of conservatives in the US view Ukraine as some sort of foreign meddling we shouldn\u2019t we be doing when Ukraine is in fact an independent and recognised country?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Those are almost exclusively Trump-aligned Republicans, who are essentially reflexively opposed to anything that Democrats support. Trump himself has vaccilated on Ukraine, both touting the fact that his administration was the first to send weapons to Ukraine while also regularly heaping praise on Putin and saying the US is spending too much money on Ukraine. That&#39;s another aspect as well, the &quot;America First&quot; Trump aligned Republicans always complain that the US provides too much aid to countries abroad, instead claiming to want it to be spent in the US, while simultaneously calling efforts by the US to spend money on welfare, infrastructure repairs, and healthcare as &quot;socialism.&quot; Unfortunately these beliefs dominate the Republican voter base at this time. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>What is it exactly that this group fear in China but not Russia despite one clearly engaging in a neo-imperialist manner and being more vocally threatening to the US?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There&#39;s a lot of underlying racism there in all honesty, with major echoes of the &quot;yellow peril&quot; of days gone by. It&#39;s also easy for Republicans to drum up fear of &quot;Communist&quot; China, especially since the GOP voter base skews much older than the Democratic base, and vividly remembers the Cold War. Plus a lot of far-right Republicans actually have positive views of Putin&#39;s Russia because the regime itself is far-right, and implements policies that these Republicans would like to see in the US (anti-lgbt legislation, control over the media/social media, overt mixing of church and state, openly pushing Christian values, etc) and they value the &quot;masculine&quot; way that Putin&#39;s regime portrays itself to the world as the &quot;defenders of traditional values.&quot;</p>\n</div>",

While I agree, along with most that are right wing aligned, view the arming of Ukraine as an extremely cost effective way of destroying a historical enemy and allowing us to completely pivot to the pacific. I would think after seeing this war most would agree that Russia of yester year is gone and only a corpse of a regional threat is left. They have no Navy worth worrying about, their Air Force is nearly irrelevant when compared to NATO, and their land army is currently being decimated in Ukraine. So why focus on Russia in the future?

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I can give you my thoughts on why conservatives view China as the main threat. While I agree, along with most that are right wing aligned, view the arming of Ukraine as an extremely cost effective way of destroying a historical enemy and allowing us to completely pivot to the pacific. I would think after seeing this war most would agree that Russia of yester year is gone and only a corpse of a regional threat is left. They have no Navy worth worrying about, their Air Force is nearly irrelevant when compared to NATO, and their land army is currently being decimated in Ukraine. So why focus on Russia in the future?
