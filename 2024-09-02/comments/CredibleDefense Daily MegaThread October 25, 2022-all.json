Do you think they just sit around and jerk off? Of course not. Despite how much social media loves to bag on the Chechen's, they are some of the best equipped and best trained forces in Russia. Each soldier's total worth (accumulated training, equipment, capabilities, etc) is likely measured in the upper 10s of thousands of dollars (last I checked was from before 2010 so that maybe even the low 100s of thousands now-a-days).   \n\n\nIn addition to that, ever soldier that is taken off the battlefield is that much less of a threat to your own soldiers and equipment. Like I said, they're not just there to fuck around. Their goal is to kill Ukrainian soldiers and take Ukrainian land, either directly or in a supporting role.    \n\n\nFurthermore, Russia does not have hundreds of thousands of trained soldiers, they have (well had) about 900k total, but that includes air force, navy, rosgvardia, national guard, reserves, and conscripts... they sure as hell don't have that many around Kherson, best estimates were 10-20k.  \n\n\nIf one strike can take out multiple soldiers its a massive win. This kind of strike, if it turns out to be true, is the kind of thing commanders only dream of. Its extremely rare to have such a huge number of casualties from just one strike. From purely economic terms that is spending a few hundred thousand dollars on rockets to take out about $3-4 million worth of men and materials. But even that is a silly comparison. These rockets were bought by the US years, if not decades ago. They would have just been used in training ranges or disposed of eventually. Using them on the battlefield is a significantly better investment, even if they dont kill anyone. I mean WTF do you think rockets and missiles are for? Of course they don't have many, but that is why they make large explosions... to take out larger things like buildings and hopefully multiple people. This is exactly what they were designed for.",

Which isn't an unreasonable premise, if so.\n\nIt's easy, from here, for us to bark that there are no need for negotiations in a war like this, because the core demand from the side we're supporting is so simple: the withdrawal of invading forces from their country.

Ukraine has maintained a full media blackout for two weeks now, which is an amazing achievement in and by itself, but with little indication of the purpose of the blackout. Russian channels have expanded to fill the space, but with a bizarre word salad, everything from the Fort in Beau Geste to So long and thanks for all the fish. (To the last man,  vs full withdrawal). Dozens of pundits are saying that Russia\u2019s goose is cooked, but nobody can tell me where the stove his. Additionally, the bloggers I have leaned on are all over the place - They all pay lip service to operational security, and talk in passive voice, but lots keep saying they have so much to show us, that big things have happened, and wait till we see. Then there\u2019s a few like DefMon and Drive who say\u2019nothing to see here, they\u2019re just prepping the field, getting the useless mouths out of the garrison and bringing up fresh troops, who are digging in.\u2019\n\nAnd the weather stinks.\n\nSomeone gave me two cents, so I might as well pass it on.\n\n- Yes, the line has moved, particularly in the north, with 3-1 odds Russia has given up Mylove, as well as such villages as are north of the line running from Novokairy to Snihurivka- we know the first from some combat footage, and the second is obvious, as that town is \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 cryptonite.  Chkalove is the key to the sector, and could be hard to hold. The southern line is pretty much where it\u2019s been, from acrylonitrile down to the airport, then to the coast at whichever town the VDV has pushed the \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 marines out of this week.  And I think they\u2019re digging into Kherson proper, with no intention of giving Ukraine a psych coup of capturing it intact.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure the Russians have withdrawn the VDV and most RA mech forces. Truth be told, Russia had so many more troops than needed to hold the sector that both forces could retreat unmolested except by HIMARS time.  I expect Russia still has 12-15000 groups on the right bank, but their quality, armor support and artillery has dropped drastically.\n\nWhen the rain clears, Ukraine can now take the sector any time it wished, by allocating armor mech and artillery formations sufficient to steam roll the northern sector and close off the dam approaches, then relentlessly assaulting the Kherson pocket. I would be surprised to see this, as Ukraine \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 is quite protective of its people,soldiers and property, but it could be done, and there\u2019s something to be said for lancing the boil, ending Putin\u2019s loathsome \u2018squeeze play\u2019.\n\nMore likely, Ukraine will return to aggressive recon, pushing for weak spots, testing the metal of the troops on the line. They\u2019ll keep the 17th armor on call for breakthroughs, but otherwise, it will be the same polyglot of motorized infantry, TDBs, beat up marines and the same two mech brigades.\n\nI think this is all that\u2019s needed. From fires data and supply considerations, Russian artillery availability is way down, much might have been withdrawn. If that\u2019s the case, Ukraine should be in Beryslav within a week, and the sector truly cut off.  Equally from the west, units that have been going toe to toe with VDV should find success against conscripts, and push on to the airport finally.\n\nFrom there, even I won\u2019t dare conjecture.  There could be a panicked rout to the ferries, they could draw into Kherson, or baby Stalingrad, and keep it up all winter.  What our your thoughts?",

They push Russia all the way back to 2013 borders. They magically get a ceasefire declared. It is now \"peacetime,\" and they are now in possession of every square inch of internationally-recognized Ukrainian territory.\n\nHow easy will it be for the Kyiv government to maintain control of these recently-recaptured areas?

Any predictions as to whether or not Ukraine might have to do serious policing actions in these areas to suppress separatist activity?\n\nFor clarification, I'm not some sort of Russian agent. I want them hamstrung and defeated as much as anyone. I've just had this thought on my mind recently: is it really better for the Western-oriented part of Ukraine, and for the West in general, to have Ukraine recapture parts of its territory that have heavily separatist leanings? Or might it be advantageous to have a slightly smaller Ukraine that is wholly on the same page about pivoting to the West and not burdened with the responsibility of rebuilding DPR/LPR after 8 years of war? \n\nWhat happens if the Kyiv government has to suppress separatist movements in Donetsk with military force and accidentally strikes the wrong building? What happens if Ukraine is applying for EU membership and conflicts between the UAF and DPR/LPR/Crimean separatists get a little too hot? I'm not saying Putin was at all justified in launching an invasion, but it's not like the \"ethnic conflict between Ukrainians and Russians\" excuse was made up out of whole cloth either. Ethnic separatism definitely exists in those regions, and I'm wondering if it's best for the western part of Ukraine (which is clearly European-aligned) and the EU/NATO/US to just let those regions go, obviously with some sort of agreement to allow for cross-border movement for people that are not aligned with the direction their respective governments are moving in.\n\nI understand this is a bit of a rambling question, but would appreciate any input from the sub or any sources to further develop my opinion on the situation that anyone could provide. Thx.\n\nEdit: one could also add to this that Russia taking DPR/LPR and Crimea allows Putin to display something to the warhawks, while also having the Russian gov't know that they got their ass kicked in terms of what they were originally trying to accomplish (complete subjugation of Ukraine). Ukraine taking back all three territories might increase pressure on Russian gov't to try again in 2-5 years timeframe. I am totally anti-\"appeasement,\" but I also think that, at this point, Russia has taken a really severe body blow. Territorial cessions that sate them for the medium-term might mean that they fuck off and die quietly in the corner, rather than continuing to cause problems for the West.

I am totally anti-&quot;appeasement,&quot; but I also think that, at this point, Russia has taken a really severe body blow. Territorial cessions that sate them for the medium-term might mean that they fuck off and die quietly in the corner, rather than continuing to cause problems for the West. Just a thought, but, again, happy to be challenged on this.</p>\n</div>",

How do you even solve it?\n\nRussia views that basically any russian-speaking person is russian does not help situation at all.

They have done many bad things to their Slavic cousins, and now they're faced with the consequences of their actions. Even the most earnest Russian homer would be challenged at this stage of the conflict to dispute that Ukraine will remain a sovereign entity whenever the current hostilities manage to settle down. The final Ukraine-Russia borders are fairly irrelevant relative to the geo-political consequences for Russia.\n\nSo back to that constant nuclear rhetoric, Ukraine gave her nukes up in return for a non-aggression pact from the USA, Great Britain, and Russia:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Memorandum\n\nYour random person in the West probably doesn't know this, but Ukrainians will know of this betrayal. Clearly Russia does not respect the treaties it signs, so the Budapest Memorandum is null and void. From what we've seen Kazakhstan doesn't particularly like this turn of events either, and Lukashenko is a patsy of Putin so his opinion is irrelevant. The problem herein is, what is the means by which Ukraine secures her sovereignty in the future since Russia is not an honest actor? I can think of two options:\n\n1. Ukraine joins NATO and comes under the nuclear umbrella of the USA, Great Britain, and France. This predisposes that NATO permits Ukraine to join.\n2. Ukraine develops a nuclear deterrent of her own.\n\nIn terms of the practicality of item #2, Ukraine:\n\n1. Has the nuclear infrastructure to breed material for thermonuclear weapons. This might explain why Russia is so determined to hold onto the Zaporozhzhia NPP.\n2. Has the technical knowledge (inherited from the USSR) to build thermonuclear weapons.\n3. Has the means to deliver strategic nuclear weapons (or has the means to develop delivery), via cruise or ballistic missiles, to major Russian urban centers.\n\nThis is the scope of the political disaster that is the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine joining NATO is something that must be done overtly. As we've seen with Finland, the limitations of the alliance are such that this takes time and political arm-twisting. Nuclear weapons can be developed covertly, and just some day, \"blamo,\" Ukraine is a nuclear power. If the natural long-term consequence of Russian imperialism is a nuclear armed Ukraine on its doorstep, Russia had better hope and pray that Ukraine gets into NATO. An alternative scenario to another Cuban Missile Crisis that would be better for everyone would be for Ukraine to develop nuclear weapons, and then give them up in return for admittance into NATO.",

Even the most earnest Russian homer would be challenged at this stage of the conflict to dispute that Ukraine will remain a sovereign entity whenever the current hostilities manage to settle down. The final Ukraine-Russia borders are fairly irrelevant relative to the geo-political consequences for Russia.</p>\n\n<p>So back to that constant nuclear rhetoric, Ukraine gave her nukes up in return for a non-aggression pact from the USA, Great Britain, and Russia:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Memorandum\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Memorandum</a></p>\n\n<p>Your random person in the West probably doesn&#39;t know this, but Ukrainians will know of this betrayal. Clearly Russia does not respect the treaties it signs, so the Budapest Memorandum is null and void. From what we&#39;ve seen Kazakhstan doesn&#39;t particularly like this turn of events either, and Lukashenko is a patsy of Putin so his opinion is irrelevant. The problem herein is, what is the means by which Ukraine secures her sovereignty in the future since Russia is not an honest actor? I can think of two options:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Ukraine joins NATO and comes under the nuclear umbrella of the USA, Great Britain, and France. This predisposes that NATO permits Ukraine to join.</li>\n<li>Ukraine develops a nuclear deterrent of her own.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In terms of the practicality of item #2, Ukraine:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Has the nuclear infrastructure to breed material for thermonuclear weapons. This might explain why Russia is so determined to hold onto the Zaporozhzhia NPP.</li>\n<li>Has the technical knowledge (inherited from the USSR) to build thermonuclear weapons.</li>\n<li>Has the means to deliver strategic nuclear weapons (or has the means to develop delivery), via cruise or ballistic missiles, to major Russian urban centers.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This is the scope of the political disaster that is the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine joining NATO is something that must be done overtly. As we&#39;ve seen with Finland, the limitations of the alliance are such that this takes time and political arm-twisting. Nuclear weapons can be developed covertly, and just some day, &quot;blamo,&quot; Ukraine is a nuclear power. If the natural long-term consequence of Russian imperialism is a nuclear armed Ukraine on its doorstep, Russia had better hope and pray that Ukraine gets into NATO. An alternative scenario to another Cuban Missile Crisis that would be better for everyone would be for Ukraine to develop nuclear weapons, and then give them up in return for admittance into NATO.</p>\n</div>",

There already exists such a common military alliance - NATO, to which admittedly not every EU member state belongs to (time to fix that issue). \n\nI'm just imagining how a unified command EU-wide would work, by looking at Baltics as a tiny example (small neighbouring countries with very similar geopolitical challenges). Foreigners have asked why don't the Baltic states simply merge their armies (as if we are just the same people divided by arbitrary borders). Even if there was political desire for that (there really isn't), there's a couple of issues.\n\nFirstly, Estonia has tried to develop the defense strategy of \"total defense\", all men should serve in the army, there's a large reserve of men, there is a large national guard, but a tiny \"professional\" army (effectively 1 battalion is professional). Latvia has no conscription and a fully professional army (tiny), Lithuania is somewhere in-between.\n\nBut then there is the question that in war, how would a unified command operate? Surely a unified command would not try to protect all three countries equally, but would either choose to a) focus defense around Tallinn and western Estonia b) focus defense around Riga and Kura peninsula, c) focus on Lithuania's southern border to maintain landbridge to the rest of NATO.\n\nAnd while these unified scenarios would probably make sense militarily, it would be utterly and completely unacceptable to the people living in here. Fundamentally a nations' army is built to protect that nation. Sure, there can and must be co-operation between the allied armies, sure there can and must be a unified defense strategy and defense plans, but in the end all the armies will first and foremost fight on their own land to protect their own countries.\n\nNow multiply that by 27(?). There will be no EU army similar to US army.",

Even if there was political desire for that (there really isn&#39;t), there&#39;s a couple of issues.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, Estonia has tried to develop the defense strategy of &quot;total defense&quot;, all men should serve in the army, there&#39;s a large reserve of men, there is a large national guard, but a tiny &quot;professional&quot; army (effectively 1 battalion is professional). Latvia has no conscription and a fully professional army (tiny), Lithuania is somewhere in-between.</p>\n\n<p>But then there is the question that in war, how would a unified command operate? Surely a unified command would not try to protect all three countries equally, but would either choose to a) focus defense around Tallinn and western Estonia b) focus defense around Riga and Kura peninsula, c) focus on Lithuania&#39;s southern border to maintain landbridge to the rest of NATO.</p>\n\n<p>And while these unified scenarios would probably make sense militarily, it would be utterly and completely unacceptable to the people living in here. Fundamentally a nations&#39; army is built to protect that nation. Sure, there can and must be co-operation between the allied armies, sure there can and must be a unified defense strategy and defense plans, but in the end all the armies will first and foremost fight on their own land to protect their own countries.</p>\n\n<p>Now multiply that by 27(?). There will be no EU army similar to US army.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "Reposting as it got buried at the end of the last thread:\n\n>**Mercenary chief vented to Putin over Ukraine war bungling**\n\n>The confidant who vented to Russian President Vladimir Putin recently about his military\u2019s handling of the war in Ukraine was Yevgeniy Prigozhin, the founder of a Russian mercenary group that is playing a critical role for Moscow on the battlefield in Ukraine, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the matter.\n\n>Prigozhin\u2019s criticisms echoed what he has been saying publicly for weeks, the officials said, speaking anonymously to discuss sensitive intelligence. But the revelation that he felt comfortable sharing such a harsh rebuke of the Russian military effort with Putin in a private setting shows how his influence is rising as Moscow\u2019s war falters. It also highlights the shaky standing of the Russian defense establishment\u2019s formal leadership, which has come under fire from Prigozhin and others after months of battlefield errors and losses.\n\n>The Washington Post previously reported that a Russian insider confronted Putin personally to spotlight mismanagement of the war effort but did not name that individual.

He's still an outsider, and will be one for the foreseeable future, even if he can talk to Putin directly.\n\nWhat exactly is someone's inner circle? Here's the rest of the article regarding Prigozhin:\n\n> For years, Prigozhin operated in the shadows of Russian power, denying links to Russia\u2019s notorious Wagner mercenary group and the St. Petersburg internet troll factory that U.S. authorities said he financed to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. He helped advance the Kremlin\u2019s foreign aims outside formal structures, and earned the nickname \u201cPutin\u2019s chef\u201d owing to his ownership of a St. Petersburg restaurant Putin once frequented and a catering company boasting lucrative Russian state and city contracts.\n\n>But in recent weeks, Prigozhin has stepped into the open in a dramatic debut in Russian public life, admitting his leadership of Wagner for the first time and publicly assailing the Russian military leadership for its mistakes.\n\n>\u201cThat\u2019s the political public position that he has been striking: I am Yevgeniy Prigozhin. I\u2019m here to tell you the truth, and I\u2019ll get the job done,\u201d said a U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the matter\u2019s sensitivity and speaking generally about Prigozhin, not about the intelligence regarding his interactions with Putin.\n\n>\u201cPrigozhin\u2019s decision to confront Putin is only the latest sign of his dissatisfaction,\u201d said a person who read the report.\n\n>Prigozhin denied recent personal contact with Putin in comments to The Washington Post made late Monday through his press service.\n\n>\u201cFirst, I did not communicate personally with Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin either recently or in any foreseeable future. I did not criticize the management of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation during the conflict in Ukraine. Therefore, I cannot comment on anything,\u201d he said, adding that he had no right to criticize or praise the work of Russia\u2019s armed forces since he was not a military expert.\n\n>He also said he had not seen a video of Wagner forces complaining about food and provisions.\n\n>Prighozin often harshly criticizes journalists who ask him questions and at times has told Russian reporters to go to the front and fight against Ukraine. In addition to his denials, Prighozin issued a rambling, sexist diatribe against U.S. journalism and the Post, referring to \u201cbazaar women in the kitchen, who collect gossip and speculation\u201d and complaining of \u201cridiculous provocative and offensive questions.\u201d\n\n>Hard-liners, including those who support Prigozhin, had long been urging the Kremlin to use more scorched-earth tactics against urban centers, regardless of their impact on Ukraine\u2019s civilian population. Putin\u2019s latest moves have played to them.\n\n>\u201cHe thinks he still can win, which is why he\u2019s throwing everything he can at the situation,\u201d said Fiona Hill, a former senior White House official handling Russian and Eurasian affairs. \u201cWe\u2019re in that period now where he\u2019s trying to push us into his version of the endgame. The guy thinks he can pull it off.\u201d\n\n>Earlier this month, Prigozhin said in a statement posted to social media that the Russian military\u2019s top brass was out of touch with the situation on the ground in Ukraine. \u201cI think that we should send all these bastards barefoot to the front with machine guns,\u201d he said.\n\n>It\u2019s unclear if Prigozhin is primarily focused on wresting more influence within the Russian defense establishment or if he harbors greater political ambitions for himself or those close to him.\n\n>With public criticism of Putin still taboo, Shoigu has borne the brunt of frustration over the conflict and in recent months has been \u201csidelined within the Russian leadership, with operational commanders briefing President Putin directly on the course of the war,\u201d according to an assessment by Britain\u2019s Defense Ministry in August.\n\n>The ministry said Shoigu is struggling to overcome his reputation as \u201clacking substantive military experience, as he spent most of his career in the construction sector and the Ministry of Emergency Situations.\u201d\n\n>Prigozhin, meanwhile, is presenting himself as a more extreme, unvarnished alternative.\n\n>A video that began circulating on Russian social media in September showed Prigozhin recruiting potential fighters at a Russian prison. Prigozhin later responded to criticism of his prisoner recruitment efforts in a statement released on VK by his catering firm.\n\n>\u201cThose who do not want mercenaries or prisoners to fight \u2026 who do not like this topic, send your children to the front,\u201d Prigozhin said. \u201cIt\u2019s either them or your children, decide for yourself.\u201d About a week later, Putin ordered a mobilization of what the Russian Defense Ministry said would be 300,000 reservists to replenish depleted forces. The move sent hundreds of thousands of eligible men fleeing Russia to avoid being called to battle.\n\n>Before the war began to go badly for the Russian military, \u201cit wasn\u2019t propitious\u201d for critics to seize the spotlight. But \u201cpeople like Prigozhin now see a chance to grab for the brass ring,\u201d said Hill, now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution\u2019s Center on the United States and Europe. \u201cThis really shows the system is under stress, when people start pushing themselves forward like this.\u201d\n\n>Prigozhin has risen far above his humble roots as a hot dog vendor in Putin\u2019s home city of Leningrad. He spent nine years in prison for robbery and other crimes, then co-founded casinos and a floating restaurant, where he personally served Putin, then Russia\u2019s new president, as well as President George W. Bush. He then opened a catering business that won contracts with the Russian government. After years of denials, he only recently publicly admitted he founded Wagner in May 2014 to support Russian-backed separatists in their effort to seize control of the Donbas region of Ukraine.\n\n>The U.S. Treasury Department imposed new sanctions on Prigozhin in March due to the Wagner Group\u2019s involvement in the war. Prior to that, he was already sanctioned and indicted by the United States for financing the Internet Research Agency, a Russian troll factory that U.S. intelligence agencies said was part of a Kremlin effort to interfere in the 2016 election. The United States has said the group has sought to spread \u201cfalse narratives online\u201d seeking to undermine governments in the U.S., Asia, Europe and elsewhere.\n\n>His years in prison and hardscrabble beginnings likely built resentment against the political elites and those who enjoyed privilege after the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse, Laruelle said.\n\n>The war has aided his ambition. \u201cHe wants political recognition,\u201d she said. \u201cMoney is not enough. I think he really cares about having an official status.\u201d\n\n>The increasingly prominent public role of figures such as Prigozhin and Kadyrov in the war effort is irritating some Russian officials, who see them as rogue actors who play by their own rules. \u201cTo have leaders like Prigozhin and Kadyrov \u2014 they [the establishment] can\u2019t live with this any more,\u201d one Russian official said in an interview. \u201cThis is not Russia.
