            "body": "Here's a paper from DTIC that touches on the problem. If you're interested in reading section 1 is the most relevant to what you're interested in but section 2 is also very interesting.\n\n1. Labor costs are high in the US.\n\n>Table 10 depicts the major European shipbuilding nations ordered from lowest tohighest based on GDP per capita. GDP is a measure of the value of goods and services\nproduced in a country. GDP per capita is a measure of GDP per the population within a country, giving a measure of a country\u2019s economic prosperity. The Office of Personnel\nManagement estimates that the average number of hours worked by full-time employees annually is 2,080 hours per year. By dividing GDP per capita by 2,080 hours, GDP per\nhour can be determined to compare the cost of labor between each NATO nation. Table 10shows that among the leading NATO shipbuilding nations, labor is most costly in theUnited States and least expensive in Romania. It shows that labor in Italy is nearly half as costly as the United States with a GDP per hour value of about $16.00/hour compared to the United States with a GDP per hour of about $31.50/hour. The data also shows that nations like Germany and the Netherlands have GDP per hour more closely valued to that\nof The United States with GDP per hour values of $22.23/hour and $25.05/hour respectively. This data shows that labor costs between The United Kingdom, Germany,\nand the Netherlands are fairly comparable.\n\n2. Productivity/efficiency in US yards is lower than other countries.\n\n>Many factors contribute to productivity, but the factors can be broken into two categories: those that affect the input and those that affect the output. The factors that affect the input and contribute most to productivity are management,\nshipbuilding methods, logistic capability, level of automation, a ratio of production employees to non-production employees, shipyard organization, level of technology within\nthe shipyard, employee expertise and training, and amount of employee absence and working discipline (Cagalj, 2009). Changes in ship design and technologies incorporated\nwithin ships will affect the output segment of productivity. For the purposes of this analysis, we will consider **the United States\u2019 productivity as being 40% that of European NATO nations.**\n\n3. Material (steel) costs are higher in the US than other countries.\n\n>Within the production of ships, steel and labor stand out as the highest cost contributors of a final product. According to MEPS, the leading international steel market analysis company, the United States maintains the highest prices per ton of steel as shown in Table 8. At $740 per ton as of January 2020, the United States. was 18.12%, 13.23%,\nand 26.06% more expensive than our European, Nordic, and Asian counterparts, respectively. With steel being a huge resource required for ship construction, the United States is spending a far higher amount on materials. This, coupled with the cost multiplierof combatant ship materials as demonstrated by Deschamps, the U.S. has the potential for\nlarge cost savings of building overseas. Because the Navy tends to be a single-source contractor for materials, they are vulnerable to price gouging, further increasing the price\nof materials.\n\n4. Shipyard capacity.\n\n>The U.S. industry of new construction shipyards is operating beyond capacity by 117\u2013153% and is unable to keep up with the current need (Hooper, 2019). The number of lost contracts due to the limited capacity of the seven current shipyards has driven potential GDP to other countries and allows those company\u2019s full control of the prices charged. The Navy\u2019s need to maintain ship numbers through the service life extension program (SLEP) and neglecting vital yard cycles have led to higher costs in the long run. Additionally, constant cost overruns and missed deadlines demonstrate the need for the U.S. to shift production overseas.",

For one thing, if they were going to do it, they would've done so already back when Israel's prospects for victory in Gaza were more cloudy than they are now (an actual coordinated attack with Hamas would've probably been the best way to kick off a war against Israel).\n\nFor another, both Iran and Hezbollah are both in extremely precarious domestic situations and a war with Israel would be unlikely to improve those problems. \n\nIran's economy is in desperately poor shape, they fended mass protests against their rule just last year (discontent with the regime still remains as high as ever), and they're already stretched pretty thin as is providing support to their proxies across the Middle East and munitions to Russia. Would the Iranian people, already seething at the regime, support them in a highly destructive war that Iran starts against Israel that would likely collapse the Iranian economy completely? I doubt it. \n\nHezbollah faces much of the same problems themselves. They have a large, well-equipped fighting force, but Lebanon is in dire shape economically and they're quite unpopular with much of the population, unlike in the 80s when they enjoyed more public support.

For one thing, if they were going to do it, they would&#39;ve done so already back when Israel&#39;s prospects for victory in Gaza were more cloudy than they are now (an actual coordinated attack with Hamas would&#39;ve probably been the best way to kick off a war against Israel).</p>\n\n<p>For another, both Iran and Hezbollah are both in extremely precarious domestic situations and a war with Israel would be unlikely to improve those problems. </p>\n\n<p>Iran&#39;s economy is in desperately poor shape, they fended mass protests against their rule just last year (discontent with the regime still remains as high as ever), and they&#39;re already stretched pretty thin as is providing support to their proxies across the Middle East and munitions to Russia. Would the Iranian people, already seething at the regime, support them in a highly destructive war that Iran starts against Israel that would likely collapse the Iranian economy completely? I doubt it. </p>\n\n<p>Hezbollah faces much of the same problems themselves. They have a large, well-equipped fighting force, but Lebanon is in dire shape economically and they&#39;re quite unpopular with much of the population, unlike in the 80s when they enjoyed more public support.

We only knew that its previous target was the most valuable military asset located in Ukraine: a Patriot battery worth approximately $1 billion (and I challenge anyone to identify a more expensive or valuable military system in Ukraine for Russia to target).

You use Kinzhals to evade enemy air defense. Ukraine can use any of its air defense systems to successfully target a cruise missile, but it takes a Patriot to take down a Kinzhal.\n\nOne reason for using a Kinzhal is to find out where Ukraine has its Patriot systems set up. They'd probably like to resume bombing Krinky with glide bombs. As far as I know, Ukraine's little Patriot ambush a week ago sufficiently scared them into backing off.

Ukraine can use any of its air defense systems to successfully target a cruise missile, but it takes a Patriot to take down a Kinzhal.</p>\n\n<p>One reason for using a Kinzhal is to find out where Ukraine has its Patriot systems set up.

At the very least they want the media cycle to move on and forget about Gaza like the western media cycle has forgotten about Ukraine and simply ignores all of the other sordid affairs in Africa and Myanmar, While they are forced to delay operations in Gaza they instead are now clearly preparing the Lebanese and Judean fronts for higher intensity operations if needed, either to deter Hezbollah or launch a similar scale attack to eliminate Hezbollah.\n\nWhile the IDF does need to conduct shaping operations across Lebanon, Syria and Iraq in preparation for and deterrence of a Hezbollah war I believe this should not come at the expense of the successful completion of the Gaza campaign. The definition of that campaign has been so intensively politicised and interfered with by both internal Israeli politics and external political pressure primarily from the Americans resulting in the incoherent strategy we are witnessing. Nevertheless it remains that the most basic definition for a successful Gaza campaign includes both of the following: \n\n* that the hostages are rescued, or their bodies are retrieved (I don\u2019t think there\u2019s many left alive at this point)\n* and that Hamas is militarily destroyed with a cessation of meaningful access to weaponry, C and C, logistics of any sort, and prepared positions both offensive and defensive represented by their tunnel complexes. \n\nThat by no means will equal \u201cpeace\u201d, or \u201cjustice\u201d, or a \u201csolution\u201d to the Gaza question or the larger Palestinian problem.

However, it will if obtained facilitate a more mobile and concentrated IDF to respond to other threats without a dilution of resources beyond the minimum necessary garrison. It will warn Hezbollah and the Iranian proxies, remind the Arab states why they concluded peace agreements, and prepare the Israeli forces for the next stage against Iran.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is some sort of a hope that allowing Hamas forces to reconstitute under a lower intensity campaign will improve target acquisition and accuracy of intel over time. Perhaps they want to lure fighters back into open engagements away from non combatants so that they can be more cleanly eliminated and networks, logistics, emergent C and C, and tunnel points can be revealed, mapped and destroyed.

This would explain how Israel has been able to advance much quicker than most expected.\n\nHow credible is this theory?

            "body": "This gets floated around and in my opinion, it's a narrative meant to explain why Hamas' performance on the defensive has been so poor. It's not too different from the \"Russia hasn't sent in its real army\" takes to explain Russia's awful performance in February-March 2022 and the \"Ukraine hasn't sent its best most NATO-trained units\" when the Ukrainian summer offensive became an immediate debacle.\n\nRather, the explanation that appears to be the most obvious probably is the correct one.\n\n1. The bulk of Hamas' capable units were killed/captured/wounded during the October 7th offensive. This makes more sense when you consider that Hamas doesn't operate as a professional military like the United States or Russia. Hamas units aren't highly standardized and use whatever equipment they get their hands on. Intelligence shows that Hamas was training for the attack for a few years. These men would have been honestly trained soldiers who understood combat and made it their living. With much of Hamas' military capability easily degraded, it makes a defense of Gaza a lot more difficult. We've seen both Russia and Ukraine struggle with creating capable units, and these are two real militaries with long traditions. Hamas has a percentage of their abilities.\n\n2. They simply didn't plan for the event happening, or their plan wasn't adequate. Hamas' defense of the Gaza Strip may have relied upon an uprising in the West Bank, an offensive by Hezbollah from the north, a stronger Arab response or a relatively passive Israeli response.

It&#39;s not too different from the &quot;Russia hasn&#39;t sent in its real army&quot; takes to explain Russia&#39;s awful performance in February-March 2022 and the &quot;Ukraine hasn&#39;t sent its best most NATO-trained units&quot; when the Ukrainian summer offensive became an immediate debacle.</p>\n\n<p>Rather, the explanation that appears to be the most obvious probably is the correct one.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The bulk of Hamas&#39; capable units were killed/captured/wounded during the October 7th offensive. This makes more sense when you consider that Hamas doesn&#39;t operate as a professional military like the United States or Russia. Hamas units aren&#39;t highly standardized and use whatever equipment they get their hands on. Intelligence shows that Hamas was training for the attack for a few years. These men would have been honestly trained soldiers who understood combat and made it their living. With much of Hamas&#39; military capability easily degraded, it makes a defense of Gaza a lot more difficult. We&#39;ve seen both Russia and Ukraine struggle with creating capable units, and these are two real militaries with long traditions. Hamas has a percentage of their abilities.</p></li>\n<li><p>They simply didn&#39;t plan for the event happening, or their plan wasn&#39;t adequate.
