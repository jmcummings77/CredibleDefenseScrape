The Russian Defense Ministry didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\n>The move represents a remarkable setback for Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose military seizure of Crimea in 2014 marked the opening shots in his attempt to take control of Ukraine. His full-scale invasion of last year has now boomeranged, forcing the removal of ships from a port that was first claimed by Russia in 1783 under Catherine the Great.\n\n>The withdrawal from Sevastopol follows a series of strikes by Ukraine in recent weeks that have severely damaged Russian vessels and the fleet's headquarters.\n\n>The immediate military effects of the move are limited, as the ships will still be able to fire cruise missiles on civilian infrastructure such as ports and power grids, naval experts said. Ukraine's strikes had already broken the fleet's blockade of Ukrainian ports, denying Russian access to parts of the Black Sea and opening a new corridor for Ukraine to dispatch economically vital grain shipments.\n\n>But the withdrawal is a timely boost for Ukraine as its counteroffensive advances more slowly than planned amid heavy losses and political ructions in the U.S. raise questions about funding for Kyiv's efforts to expel Russian occupying forces.\n\n>James Heappey, U.K. minister of state for the armed forces, called the dispersal of the ships \"the functional defeat of the Black Sea Fleet\" at a conference in Warsaw this week.\n\n>Satellite images dated Oct. 1 and provided by Planet Labs showed that the bulk of the naval vessels were moved to Novorossiysk, a Russian port on the Black Sea, said Mikhail Barabanov, a senior analyst at the Center for the Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, a Moscow-based defense think tank, who reviewed the images. The craft included all three of its operational Kilo-class attack submarines, two guided-missile frigates and one patrol ship. Other vessels, including a large landing ship, a number of small missile ships and new minesweepers were moved to the port of Feodosiya, farther east along the Crimean Peninsula, Barabanov said.\n\n>While the move may represent only a temporary measure to safeguard against further Ukrainian strikes, the logistical headache of relocating some of Russia's heaviest ships underscores the threat of Kyiv's strike capabilities.\n\n>Ukraine has targeted Crimea in recent weeks with cruise missiles that have seriously damaged a Russian submarine and a large landing vessel, as well as the headquarters of the Black Sea Fleet. Analysts say those strikes likely used cruise missiles provided by the U.K. and France, which have placed restrictions on their use, meaning they can't hit Novorossiysk.\n\n>\"The main factor in the decision is that the West until now has forbidden Ukraine from using Western weaponry for strikes within the 2014 borders of the Russian Federation,\" said Barabanov. Ukraine successfully struck Novorossiysk using its own locally-produced naval drones earlier this year.\n\n>Yoruk Isik, a naval expert and the head of the Bosphorus Observer consulting firm, said that the satellite images showed nets and barges placed at the entrance to the shipyard in Feodosiya, illustrating Russia's concern about further Ukrainian attacks on the facility.\n\n>\"They have some security concerns that Ukraine can run a successful naval operation here,\" said Isik, who also confirmed that the images showed that the Russian warships had moved from Sevastopol to the other ports.\n\n>Since thwarting Russia's hopes of seizing Odesa at the start of the war in spring 2022, Ukraine has fought back in the Black Sea despite its lack of naval power.\n\n>Last year, Ukraine sank the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet, the missile cruiser Moskva, with a domestically produced antiship missile and recaptured the small but strategic Snake Island in the Black Sea.\n\n>Ukrainian commandos have also been conducting raids around Crimea. On Wednesday, Ukraine's military intelligence agency, known as HUR, said its forces had landed in Crimea and attacked Russian soldiers.\n\n>\"There was a battle with the Russian invaders,\" Andriy Yusov, a spokesman for HUR, said in a statement to Ukrainian media. He said the Ukrainians had inflicted casualties on the Russians but added, \"Unfortunately, there are losses among the Ukrainian defenders.\"\n\n>Ukraine has intensified its strikes on the Russian fleet in recent months as Russia escalated attacks on Ukrainian ports and civilian ships in the Black Sea. Russia in July withdrew from a Turkish- and United Nations-brokered agreement that had unblocked Ukrainian grain exports from Odesa. The agreement, signed in July 2022, had guaranteed the safety of vessels via a designated maritime corridor, contributing to a military de-escalation in the Black Sea and providing an economic lifeline to Ukraine.\n\n>After withdrawing from the grain agreement, Russia threatened to intercept civilian ships heading to Ukraine and launched a series of missile and drone attacks on key Ukrainian port and grain-exporting infrastructure.\n\n>Ukraine's military response has limited the Russian navy's ability to maneuver in the Black Sea. Ukrainian surface drones rammed a Russian landing ship in the port of Novorossiysk and attacked another ship in open water. Ukraine also used its sea drones to attack an oil tanker that carries jet fuel for the Russian air force and a bridge that links the Russian mainland to Crimea.\n\n>A Ukrainian military spokeswoman said Wednesday that Ukraine had pushed back the front line in the Black Sea to at least 100 nautical miles from Ukraine's shorelines. Russian ships no longer go beyond Cape Tarkhankut, at the western end of the Crimean Peninsula, said Natalia Humeniuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's southern defense forces.\n\n>\"Currently, ships and boats of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation do not actually sail in the direction of the territorial sea of Ukraine,\" she said.\n\n>Russia is also constrained in the Black Sea due to a decision by Turkey last year to implement an international treaty that bans warring states from bringing additional warships through the Turkish straits, the strategic chokepoint at the entrance to the region. Turkish officials invoked the 1936 Montreux Convention, barring Russia from bringing ships from its other naval forces around the world.\n\n>Ukraine's breaking of Russian military dominance in the Black Sea could also boost the Ukrainian economy. Ukraine opened up a new maritime corridor for civilian ships transiting to and from Odesa as an alternative to the Turkish- and U.N.-backed agreement. The new shipping lane hugs Ukraine's coastline, which is protected by the Ukrainian military, before entering the coastal waters of Romania and Bulgaria, which are members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n\n>The first ship to leave via the corridor sailed in August, with a series of ships entering and leaving the shipping lane at an increasing pace in recent days. Another 12 ships were waiting to enter the corridor as of Wednesday, the Ukrainian navy said.",

Russian ships no longer go beyond Cape Tarkhankut, at the western end of the Crimean Peninsula, said Natalia Humeniuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine&#39;s southern defense forces.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Currently, ships and boats of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation do not actually sail in the direction of the territorial sea of Ukraine,&quot; she said.</p>\n\n<p>Russia is also constrained in the Black Sea due to a decision by Turkey last year to implement an international treaty that bans warring states from bringing additional warships through the Turkish straits, the strategic chokepoint at the entrance to the region. Turkish officials invoked the 1936 Montreux Convention, barring Russia from bringing ships from its other naval forces around the world.</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine&#39;s breaking of Russian military dominance in the Black Sea could also boost the Ukrainian economy. Ukraine opened up a new maritime corridor for civilian ships transiting to and from Odesa as an alternative to the Turkish- and U.N.-backed agreement. The new shipping lane hugs Ukraine&#39;s coastline, which is protected by the Ukrainian military, before entering the coastal waters of Romania and Bulgaria, which are members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.</p>\n\n<p>The first ship to leave via the corridor sailed in August, with a series of ships entering and leaving the shipping lane at an increasing pace in recent days. Another 12 ships were waiting to enter the corridor as of Wednesday, the Ukrainian navy said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Clearing a path for Ukrainian membership has been a top priority for EU leaders since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion last year.\n\nEU officials this summer estimated the potential financial ramifications in a study seen by the Financial Times, which used existing rules for the union\u2019s 2021-27 budget. These were applied to an enlarged union including Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia and six western Balkan states.\n\nThe financial tally of adding all nine members to the existing budget, known as the multiannual financial framework, would be \u20ac256.8bn, the paper estimates. The knock-on effects for existing member states would include a cut in farm subsidies of about a fifth.\n\nAlthough full enlargement could take a decade or more and would force big reforms to existing budget arrangements, the estimated scale of change required would decisively tip the financial balance within the bloc.\n\n\u201cAll member states will have to pay more to and receive less from the EU budget; many member states who are currently net receivers will become net contributors,\u201d concluded the paper by the secretariat of the EU council.\n\nWith nine new member states, the current budget would increase by 21 per cent to \u20ac1.47tn, the paper estimates. That equates to about 1.4 per cent of the 36 countries\u2019 gross national income.\n\nThe entry of nine states would force a number of \u201cfar-reaching\u201d adjustments that could include a significant increase in net budget contributions from richer states such as Germany, France and the Netherlands. \u201cTransitional periods and safeguard measures\u201d would be necessary, the paper suggests.\n\nApplying current rules to an expanded union, Ukraine would be eligible for \u20ac96.5bn from the EU\u2019s Common Agricultural Policy over seven years. That financial shift would force cuts in farm subsidies to existing member states of about 20 per cent, according to the study.\n\nUkraine would also qualify for \u20ac61bn in payments from the EU\u2019s cohesion funds, which aim to improve infrastructure in poorer member states. With nine additional member states, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Lithuania, Slovenia, Cyprus and Malta would no longer be eligible for cohesion funding, the study estimates.\n\nThe calculations by the general secretariat of the council, the body that represents the bloc\u2019s 27 member state governments, come as the EU weighs up whether to agree to open formal accession negotiations with Ukraine by the end of this year, as Kyiv has requested.\n\nA spokesperson for the EU council said: \u201cWe do not comment on leaks.\u201d\n\nEU leaders will meet in Spain on Friday for their first detailed discussions as a group on enlargement and the ways it would change the union.\n\nThe study employs a simple extrapolation of the EU\u2019s existing budget rules, which would almost certainly be adjusted in the event of enlargement. It was not developed in conjunction with, or endorsed by, the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive. It does not take into account the possible membership of Turkey.\n\n\u201cWhilst for several policies, opportunities may outweigh the costs/risks, and enlargement will bring benefits to the current member states, enlargement will also have far-reaching impacts on the EU budget,\u201d the paper states.\n\nIt adds: \u201c[these] very significant challenges for the EU\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009will need to be thoroughly addressed also in order for this new enlargement to be at least accepted, if not supported by our citizens\u201d.\n\nThe paper outlines opportunities for the EU from enlargement, including bolstering the EU\u2019s geopolitical clout, increasing the bloc\u2019s internal market size by 66mn people to 517mn, and addressing labour shortages.\n\nBut it makes clear that Ukraine\u2019s impact on the EU\u2019s agricultural subsidy regime would be the most significant. Ukraine would be the bloc\u2019s largest recipient, with 41.1mn hectares of utilised agricultural area, pushing France into second place. That would mean payments for existing recipients would fall by 20.3 per cent per hectare of qualifying farmland.\n\nAside from Ukraine, adding the other eight countries would cost a total of \u20ac29.9bn in CAP payments.\n\n\u201cThese numbers aren\u2019t going to work for anyone,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at the Eurasia Group. \u201cThey make clear that root and branch reform of the EU budget and its major policies will be needed if Ukraine is to ever join, or that the entire Ukraine question will have to be dealt with innovatively and outside of existing EU budget structures.\u201d",

It does not take into account the possible membership of Turkey.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhilst for several policies, opportunities may outweigh the costs/risks, and enlargement will bring benefits to the current member states, enlargement will also have far-reaching impacts on the EU budget,\u201d the paper states.</p>\n\n<p>It adds: \u201c[these] very significant challenges for the EU\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009will need to be thoroughly addressed also in order for this new enlargement to be at least accepted, if not supported by our citizens\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>The paper outlines opportunities for the EU from enlargement, including bolstering the EU\u2019s geopolitical clout, increasing the bloc\u2019s internal market size by 66mn people to 517mn, and addressing labour shortages.</p>\n\n<p>But it makes clear that Ukraine\u2019s impact on the EU\u2019s agricultural subsidy regime would be the most significant. Ukraine would be the bloc\u2019s largest recipient, with 41.1mn hectares of utilised agricultural area, pushing France into second place. That would mean payments for existing recipients would fall by 20.3 per cent per hectare of qualifying farmland.</p>\n\n<p>Aside from Ukraine, adding the other eight countries would cost a total of \u20ac29.9bn in CAP payments.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThese numbers aren\u2019t going to work for anyone,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at the Eurasia Group. \u201cThey make clear that root and branch reform of the EU budget and its major policies will be needed if Ukraine is to ever join, or that the entire Ukraine question will have to be dealt with innovatively and outside of existing EU budget structures.\u201d</p>\n</div>",

The dozens of hard-hatted staffers who gravitated toward nearby street vendors couldn\u2019t be told apart except for brightly hued safety vests that bore their employers\u2019 names and official logos.\n\n>They included a unit of Taiwanese chip material reseller Topco Scientific Co. and a subsidiary of Taipei-based L&K Engineering Co., according to a Bloomberg News investigation. Across town at another Huawei-affiliated site, Bloomberg identified workers from a subsidiary of construction specialist United Integrated Services Co.\n\n>Meanwhile, Taiwan\u2019s Cica-Huntek Chemical Technology Taiwan Co. said on its website that it had won contracts to build chemical supply systems for two Chinese chipmakers \u2014 Shenzhen Pensun Technology Co. and Pengxinwei IC Manufacturing Co., which was blacklisted by the US last year. Both companies have been identified as working with Huawei to build chip fabrication facilities. The company removed the online reference after Bloomberg News inquired about it.\n\n>The previously unreported Taiwanese presence in Huawei\u2019s efforts risk triggering a backlash on an island that is preparing for polls next January, with the question of Taiwan\u2019s rocky relationship with China likely the most pivotal issue.\n\n>At a time when China threatens Taiwan regularly with military action for even contemplating independence, it\u2019s unusual that members of the island\u2019s most important industry may be helping US-sanctioned Huawei develop semiconductors to effectively break an American blockade. Those sanctions were called into question after Huawei unveiled a smartphone in late August with an advanced made-in-China chip, spurring alarm in Washington and calls to completely cut off Huawei and its Shanghai-based chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp.\n\n>Away from SMIC, Huawei is setting up its own shadow network of chipmakers with tens of billions of dollars in Chinese government support, according to trade group Semiconductor Industry Association. Huawei was said to be relying on a trio of little-known firms in Shenzhen \u2014 Pengxinwei, Pensun and SwaySure Technology Co. \u2014 to help it turn its chip designs into reality.\n\n>\u201cThe chips from these plants built with Taiwanese companies\u2019 help could eventually be used on Chinese missiles aimed at Taiwan,\u201d said Li Jung-Shian, professor of electrical engineering at Tainan, Taiwan-based National Cheng Kung University. \u201cThe government of Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen is not being serious about Taiwan\u2019s defense if it does not tighten controls on local firms\u2019 support for Huawei.\u201d\n\n>It\u2019s unclear whether the Taiwanese companies\u2019 potential involvement violates American sanctions, in part because US curbs are designed to curtail the export of American-origin technology to Huawei rather than blocking all business relationships. Kevin Wolf, a partner at Akin Gump who specializes in trade policy, says it\u2019s impossible to know whether these firms are violating US regulations without more detailed information. Because of the complexity of US sanctions against Huawei, it can be difficult to determine such violations without knowing exactly what technologies and equipment suppliers are using.\n\n>Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of Economic Affairs, responsible for export controls, said that it will look into the four Taiwanese firms\u2019 relations with Huawei. The ministry said in a statement in response to Bloomberg enquiries that it will reach out to the companies to \u201cgain an understanding\u201d of their activities in the region. The US Commerce Department declined to comment on the Huawei suppliers but referred Bloomberg News to previous statements where they said they were investigating the Chinese company\u2019s reported chip advances.\n\n>\u201cThe ministry will also tell these firms to pay attention to US export control measures if the equipment they use are restricted by American rules,\u201d the Taiwanese agency said in its statement.\n\n>Representatives for Huawei and L&K Engineering did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\n>A Topco representative confirmed that a Chinese subsidiary has an ongoing contract to handle waste water for Pengxinwei, or PXW, and said that environmental projects aren\u2019t prohibited by US sanctions. Topco said it secured the contract before PXW\u2019s blacklisting and doesn\u2019t supply semiconductor equipment or material. Cica-Huntek won a contract for Pengxinwei\u2019s chemical supply system in 2022, according to the firm\u2019s now-deleted web page seen by Bloomberg News. A representative for the company declined to comment.\n\n>Additionally, a tank truck from specialty gases supplier Air Liquide SA was spotted leaving the PXW campus in August. The French company said it fully complies with regulations wherever it operates.\n\n>\u201cWith regards to PXW, Air Liquide China operates in full compliance with applicable regulations, supplying it only with products that are not subject to the U.S. Export Administration Regulations,\u201d Air Liquide said in a statement.\n\n>The French finance ministry said it can\u2019t comment on US regulations and hasn\u2019t discussed Air Liquide\u2019s ties with PXW with American officials.\n\n>United Integrated Services confirmed that a Chinese subsidiary has won a contract to help SwaySure renovate its interior and the unit has proceeded with the project. The Taiwanese firm said as the company and its Chinese subsidiary are in the construction business and the parent does not manufacture nor export wafer-related products or equipment, they do not violate export control rules.\n\n>\u201cSince United Integrated Services was first founded, it has been complying with all relevant policies and regulations with all of its investments and businesses,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cThe company values the rights of its investors and it prioritizes the protection of social order and public interest even more.\u201d",

Sure, there are some advantages to the defender - mines, trenches etc, but attacker has advantages as well - they can choose the time, the location that favors them, they can concentrate or disperse and they can disengage when the conditions turn out unfavorable.\n\nThe real difference is firepower and man power. In more maneuver oriented war tanks and other heavy AFV would also matter, but in Ukraine things slowed down enough that heavy AFV aren't really that important. It could change of course, and fwiw RU likely has significant quantity advantage there,   but it's not really a factor right now or in the short term.\n\nBut to go back to firepower and manpower - these are the two areas that UA is struggling with, as best as we can tell. The latest on firepower, and specifically artillery, as HIMARS and similar are obviously useful but too low volume, is that they were running out very recently, and US was forced to send them cluster munitions, as Biden has admitted because there was nothing else left. Would these be enough for the next 12 months? I am skeptical, considering how fast UA was burning through previous packages, and that's assuming US even keeps sending those, which is no longer a given, considering the political situation.\n\nOk - what about manpower? Same deal - there is very compelling though circumstantial evidence that UA is starting to hit the limits of what they are capable of. The news about making women eligible, all the discussions about them trying to get people back from abroad, the dismissal of recruitment officers... those are not actions of country that doesn't have manpower issues.\n\nOk - so I think we have clear evidence that UA are going to experience real issues both in terms of firepower and manpower, in the 6-12 months time frame I've mentioned before. On the other hand, we don't see any evidence that RU is going to run into similar issues any time soon. \n\nThe next part is speculative, but based on history, specifically Western Front WW1 which I think this current conflict resembles the most. If you remember that one (and if you are not familiar it's really worth learning more about), the static trench warfare was actually broken by Germany first in spring of 1918, when they were able to bring over troops from Russia to push mostly British quite significantly, but in the process burning their last manpower and ammo reserves. This is known as Operation Michael and it wasn't enough, and what followed was very rapid disintegration of German fighting ability finally concluding with capitulation even before Allies crossed into Germany proper.\n\nSo my guess is we will see something very similar. UA will have, if they haven't already, exhaust whatever ammo and man power reserves they've had on the \"counter offensive\". There aren't really any sources to replenish those reserves - Western support is dwindling, and mobilization is getting harder and harder. RU will keep pushing ever so slowly, but it would be enough, and within 6-12 months we would see UA forces rapidly start losing combat capability. I don't expect massive big arrow WW2 style RU offensives, which is also why I think RU ability to execute those isn't relevant. At some point soon, UA will not have enough shells to counter battery, and RU will more or less walk in.",

It could change of course, and fwiw RU likely has significant quantity advantage there,   but it&#39;s not really a factor right now or in the short term.</p>\n\n<p>But to go back to firepower and manpower - these are the two areas that UA is struggling with, as best as we can tell. The latest on firepower, and specifically artillery, as HIMARS and similar are obviously useful but too low volume, is that they were running out very recently, and US was forced to send them cluster munitions, as Biden has admitted because there was nothing else left. Would these be enough for the next 12 months? I am skeptical, considering how fast UA was burning through previous packages, and that&#39;s assuming US even keeps sending those, which is no longer a given, considering the political situation.</p>\n\n<p>Ok - what about manpower? Same deal - there is very compelling though circumstantial evidence that UA is starting to hit the limits of what they are capable of. The news about making women eligible, all the discussions about them trying to get people back from abroad, the dismissal of recruitment officers... those are not actions of country that doesn&#39;t have manpower issues.</p>\n\n<p>Ok - so I think we have clear evidence that UA are going to experience real issues both in terms of firepower and manpower, in the 6-12 months time frame I&#39;ve mentioned before. On the other hand, we don&#39;t see any evidence that RU is going to run into similar issues any time soon. </p>\n\n<p>The next part is speculative, but based on history, specifically Western Front WW1 which I think this current conflict resembles the most. If you remember that one (and if you are not familiar it&#39;s really worth learning more about), the static trench warfare was actually broken by Germany first in spring of 1918, when they were able to bring over troops from Russia to push mostly British quite significantly, but in the process burning their last manpower and ammo reserves. This is known as Operation Michael and it wasn&#39;t enough, and what followed was very rapid disintegration of German fighting ability finally concluding with capitulation even before Allies crossed into Germany proper.</p>\n\n<p>So my guess is we will see something very similar. UA will have, if they haven&#39;t already, exhaust whatever ammo and man power reserves they&#39;ve had on the &quot;counter offensive&quot;. There aren&#39;t really any sources to replenish those reserves - Western support is dwindling, and mobilization is getting harder and harder. RU will keep pushing ever so slowly, but it would be enough, and within 6-12 months we would see UA forces rapidly start losing combat capability. I don&#39;t expect massive big arrow WW2 style RU offensives, which is also why I think RU ability to execute those isn&#39;t relevant. At some point soon, UA will not have enough shells to counter battery, and RU will more or less walk in.</p>\n</div>",

The GPS test app can say what it wants, but without something like WAAS or differential GPS (or some other measurement source to add to the Kalman filter), you're not improving the signal beyond the normal GPS accuracy. This should be apparent to the layman by the number of times you deviate from a route only for the GPS to momentarily think you took the route you were supposed to take. In fact, your GPS on your phone is not that accurate.\n\nThis is why missiles often use GPS and IMU data in tandem to create a merged navigation solution. Sometimes they use other data as well, such as a pitot tube for direct velocity measure, or image-based navigation as in the Storm Shadow, or an altimeter to record altitude. These extra measurements allow a Kalman filter to better assess the missile's state vector, even beyond the GPS accuracy.\n\nI read recently that some of the newer phone models use something involving Wi-Fi signals to improve navigation solution. Who knows, I'm not a phone guy. But if you're getting 3 meter accuracy, it's probably a blended solution reliant on other measures that a glide bomb isn't going to have.\n\nThat said, while I'm not as familiar with GLONASS, the principles behind differential GPS are applicable to their system as well. I'd be shocked if they didn't use it to increase their accuracy beyond GLONASS's hardware limits for military applications.",

[source](https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/special-resources/russian-air-war-and-ukrainian-requirements-air-defence)\n\nThat was one of the issues early on as to poor servicing of targets, limited strikes and no follow on BDA either. Single aircraft or pairs  seemed to work fine for them in previous conflicts especially Syria, but not in this one. \n\nA big issue the RUSI guys brought up, besides organization, leadership, coordination issues, is lack of mid air refuelers and capabilities to use them. To keep a large strike package together means aircraft from a bunch of different squadrons of different types taking off from different bases in different areas at different times all assembling for pinpoint timing.

Single aircraft or pairs  seemed to work fine for them in previous conflicts especially Syria, but not in this one. </p>\n\n<p>A big issue the RUSI guys brought up, besides organization, leadership, coordination issues, is lack of mid air refuelers and capabilities to use them. To keep a large strike package together means aircraft from a bunch of different squadrons of different types taking off from different bases in different areas at different times all assembling for pinpoint timing. Even a slight mistiming, poor weather one place, a 15 minute delay elsewhere due to a last minute mechanical issue, means aircraft already airborne need to be refueled or else they&#39;re RTB.

Got more emergency resupplies in March, blew through that over the winter, got more, blew through that. Then they got the ROK ammo stockpile in May, a couple hundred thousand rounds of mostly HE but also WP, and that was enough to start the offensive. But they botched it, which made it apparent it wouldn't end quickly, so that unlocked DPICM for them to carry them over, getting more hundreds of thousands. Now they're using up the remaining ROK HE stockpile plus getting more DPICM from the US, plus most of US monthly production rates (which aren't that much), plus EU monthly rates (which are even less).

The UA strategy to focus on Melitopol was extremely flawed as it was based on grossly optimistic assumptions about Russian weaknesses that proved untrue, not only reaching the coast but would happen afterwards. If they abandon the strategy, and they should, then the Robotyne-Verbove salient is militarily insignificant unless they can tie it into a future different strategy (which I'm fine with it it makes sense). \n\nConsidering this is now guaranteed to be a long war, Ukraine can't sacrifice its abilities to conduct future successful offensive operations just for short term political gestures involving holding ground.

So if I were him, this is my plan. \n\nFirst, my priority would be to make the sacrifices now to create a legit Ukraine run training program, privates to colonels, so everyone knows what they're doing. The investment won't pay off this year, it'll actually hurt for a while but it'll pay off down the road.\n\nThe next two years would be spent identifying better officers and working to get them developed to jump a few pay grades, as well as getting rid of the turds. Anyone who doesn't cut it becomes a private. \n\nI'd also mobilize women. Time to make that happen finally. Many go into combat arms, especially volunteers after they're mobilized, the rest can go into support jobs freeing up men who aren't absolutely critically competent at their job. \n\nIn the meantime, and I HATE saying it, I would shift to a pure attrition strategy against the Russian military with a continuation of the overall exhaustion strategy directed against their homeland. I don't like attrition strategy, I think the math is bullshit and it is framed on wishful thinking and underestimating enemy resolve and strength, but big positional wins are likely not happening anymore without major changes..\n\nFuture operations would be purely focused on damaging the Russians, wherever. I'd capitalize on interior lines and mostly mechanized/motorized force structure to move around rapidly and use speed, surprise and deception to hit specific places with utmost violence and then leave as soon as the local Russian defenders got their shit together. Multiple division plus sized units roving around the three fronts, the Russians will never know where they're striking. \n\nWith the IO campaign, I'd stop mentioning liberation altogether. NEVER brag about it, if the UAF advance then only mention what was retaken in passing after glorifying legit stats about Russian losses. If the Russians think Ukraine is interested in land, they'll defend it tenaciously to try to break Ukraine's will when they don't get it. But are they going to do the opposite, are they going to give up land to try to preserve their troops? LOL, fat chance. \n\nNor do they have other means besides digging in harder to try to preserve their force, but they're doing that already so a shift in strategy won't change that. \n\nAt a later date, hopefully [when these are mass produced](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hrim-2), I'd change it up to a land centric approach using my well trained and fully blooded mobility focused army, a million and a half boys and girls under arms, F16s ready, etc, and do something cool and destructive with it.",

The investment won&#39;t pay off this year, it&#39;ll actually hurt for a while but it&#39;ll pay off down the road.</p>\n\n<p>The next two years would be spent identifying better officers and working to get them developed to jump a few pay grades, as well as getting rid of the turds. Anyone who doesn&#39;t cut it becomes a private. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d also mobilize women. Time to make that happen finally. Many go into combat arms, especially volunteers after they&#39;re mobilized, the rest can go into support jobs freeing up men who aren&#39;t absolutely critically competent at their job. </p>\n\n<p>In the meantime, and I HATE saying it, I would shift to a pure attrition strategy against the Russian military with a continuation of the overall exhaustion strategy directed against their homeland. I don&#39;t like attrition strategy, I think the math is bullshit and it is framed on wishful thinking and underestimating enemy resolve and strength, but big positional wins are likely not happening anymore without major changes..</p>\n\n<p>Future operations would be purely focused on damaging the Russians, wherever. I&#39;d capitalize on interior lines and mostly mechanized/motorized force structure to move around rapidly and use speed, surprise and deception to hit specific places with utmost violence and then leave as soon as the local Russian defenders got their shit together. Multiple division plus sized units roving around the three fronts, the Russians will never know where they&#39;re striking. </p>\n\n<p>With the IO campaign, I&#39;d stop mentioning liberation altogether. NEVER brag about it, if the UAF advance then only mention what was retaken in passing after glorifying legit stats about Russian losses. If the Russians think Ukraine is interested in land, they&#39;ll defend it tenaciously to try to break Ukraine&#39;s will when they don&#39;t get it. But are they going to do the opposite, are they going to give up land to try to preserve their troops? LOL, fat chance. </p>\n\n<p>Nor do they have other means besides digging in harder to try to preserve their force, but they&#39;re doing that already so a shift in strategy won&#39;t change that. </p>\n\n<p>At a later date, hopefully <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hrim-2\">when these are mass produced</a>, I&#39;d change it up to a land centric approach using my well trained and fully blooded mobility focused army, a million and a half boys and girls under arms, F16s ready, etc, and do something cool and destructive with it.</p>\n</div>",
