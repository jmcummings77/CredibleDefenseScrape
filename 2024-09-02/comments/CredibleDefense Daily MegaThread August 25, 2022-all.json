That's basically the same amount of artillery that a [Russian maneuver brigade](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/200th_Separate_Motor_Rifle_Brigade) has, which isn't odd because both retained the old Soviet model of \"we're an artillery army with lots of AFV too.\"\n\nThe TDF have no arty because they have no highly trained troops, they're all \"light infantry\" because that's all that barely trained cannon fodder can produce (UAF reserve colonel on Geopolitics Decanted bragged about them being using  as cannon fodder, take that up with him). They can't be given arty and be expected to use them, they're not trained for it. Those that are trained a artillerymen don't end up or stay in TDF brigades. Want TDF to have arty? Take that up with the Zelensky and General Tantsyura.\n\nThe only UAF units besides TDF that won't have arty are those who have lost theirs due to combat or maintenance losses, those who are newly raised reservist brigades created after the war started who are notoriously under-equipped because Ukraine didn't have a real plan to arm/equip it's reserve force, those who still have artillery pieces but no ammo because they used so much of their domestic stores of shells or rockets and can't get enough for resupply, and lastly those who do have artillery pieces and available shells in strategic inventory but who can't get the shells because supply lines are long and slow where they are located.\n\nThe Russians have an artillery advantage in the Donbas for many many reasons beyond counting tubes, but they have more tubes mainly because they massed more units in that front, and especially in the specific sectors under heavy concentration. The more Russian units present, the more artillery present. The less UAF units present to defend the Donbas, especially who aren't TDF, the less artillery present.\n\nIf we give UA 200-300 more artillery pieces, basically double what we gave them already, that will be enough for 10-15  battalions worth of tube artillery. That means having enough brigades with no arty or needing western 105 or 155 caliber. But it still doesn't fix the problem, are they going to end up where they need to be? . \n\nWhat the UAF needs to do is to send more non-TDF brigades to troublesome places. Afraid of losing the Donbas? Don't send more maneuver brigades to reinforce Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and Kharkiv to launch more counteroffensives.\n\nEconomy of force: the principle of war of employing all available combat power in the most effective way possible, in an attempt to allocate a minimum of essential combat power to any secondary efforts.",

Or about 5-20 trucks an hour.\n\nThe Antonovsky bridge is 1.3 kilometers long and would take only a couple minutes to get across. The Russians were seen having multiple trucks on the bridge at the same time, but on different spans. They could probably surpass that. And that\u2019s not counting ferries or pontoons or barges. \n\nWhen the bridge is fully taken out, that\u2019s another question\n\nSo that doesn\u2019t really matter.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t take into account mechanized units which are much higher (up to 2,000 tons more than per unit) which actually means this is, to an extent, irrelevant. But say up to 60 trucks an hour then. That isn\u2019t as doable with the bridge out which is probably the reason there is some what of an ammo shortage.

Or about 5-20 trucks an hour.</p>\n\n<p>The Antonovsky bridge is 1.3 kilometers long and would take only a couple minutes to get across.

But say up to 60 trucks an hour then. That isn\u2019t as doable with the bridge out which is probably the reason there is some what of an ammo shortage.

They are publicly making it sound like they will support America in any Taiwan conflict, but privately telling us military that they might not help even if china attacks the US military bases that are located in Japan.  That is absolutely the most foolish strategy Japan could take.  With their current public posture, any pla planning would have to assume that Japan would be involved in any responses that America might take toward Taiwan.  As such, if china plans to pre-emptively attack us military bases in westpac, they will also plan on destroying the major Japanese military bases.  So, you are seeing this major buildup of df17 and df26 currently with plarf.  If pla believes that American involvement in Taiwan is close to certain (which seems to be the case), then the only logical case is for them to buy enough missiles to completely destroy us and Japanese forces based in Japan.  Keep in mind that while Japan does have a modern navy, its main surface combatants are probably equivalent to what's available in the 7th fleet.  On top of that, everything will be well within range of df17 and every lacm in service with pla.  So, you have to ask yourself whether pla has enough ground, air and sea launched missiles to destroy most of the primary surface combatants in 7th fleet, jmsdf and the major air defense systems and disable major air bases.  From what I can see right now (and can be confirmed by patchwork), they do or at least will have in a couple of years.  As in, they can disable enough naval ships, air defense systems, command centers and runways with the initial ground launched, h6 launched and ship launched missiles such follow on attacks from j20s and j16s can be done with much degraded opposition.   If you look at jasdf, they only have about 4 major air bases for pla to target.  And a couple of them are located next to us military bases.  So, it is quite likely that plaaf would be able to achieve initial air superiority over Japan and continue to degrade the air bases to the point that they simply can't launch aircraft.  And they will also likely target refineries, power plants and strategic reserves.  The diesel subs are likely to survive the initial onslaught but they actually have to snorkel every couple of days to ventilate.  At 8 knots, they can't go that far.  As long as china has enough MPAs, they will be detected when they ventilate.\n\nThe other issue they have is the dependence on imported oil and natural gas.  The vast majority of that comes through scs or east china sea.  These sea lanes are controlled by plan.  On top of that, china has a huge cutters force that will likely be used to prevent any tankers and LNG carriers from reaching Japan.  Basically, achieving an effective blockade of Japan.   You can make your own predictions on how long Japan can hold on in that scenario.\n\nHaving said this, Japan really has two logical path.  If it determines that it can build enough air defense to counter pla missiles, then it should accelerate that and build a whole lot more military bases around Japan to create enough targets that even pla can't destroy with it's huge missiles force.  It will probably need to triple its military budget and hope that pla doesn't do something similar.  If it determines that is not possible, then it needs to publicly and privately tell America to back off and not get involved in Taiwan.  I currently do not see any movement from Japan on either front.  Which means if a us/china war breaks out, Japan will suffer a level of destruction only surpassed by Taiwan.",

First off, NK is one of the most isolated countries in the world if not the most isolated, this presents several problems for any sort of resistance and realizing that they have it bad and could have it better is the least of their issues. \n\nEven if the general consensus is that the outside world is better (which despite the regime's best attempts, it probably is, it was the case with the population of just about every Warsaw Pact country and that was before the world became truly globalized and when there were a dozen countries sharing the same fate) alright, where to go from here? \n\nMerely expressing that sort of discontentment is highly frowned upon as it is a risky thing to do in most authoritarian states but NK especially has it's population tightly locked down like no other in history, so resistance for most people stops there and they continue to endure, but say you're willing to risk your life and for some reason you trust in people who have every reason to betray you, and you somehow manage to form a small group that starts to gain traction, what hope does your resistance have when your numbers and equipment are nowhere near enough but there's also no one to turn to?\n\nThere's no outside force willing to meddle with NK's internal affairs especially now that their nuclear program is in full force and China would also go against whoever is trying to cause a crisis on their border, even if by some miracle, an inside resistance (that would no doubt be a very small minority of the population, as enduring is simply the best and most rational option for most peope under their circumstances and people would have a hard time organizing resistance in a regime like NK's) were to form, then what?\n\nThere's no one in the world who would show even the slightest support for them beyond empty platitudes, helping them in a useful way would also be practically impossible with how tightly locked down NK is. Take Burma for example, the Tatmadaw runs a country that's much more open, larger even the terrain is much better for a resistance, and they are a long way from having the iron grip on their population NK's leadership has (while I don't talk much about it in this response, this is very important and it's hard to illustrate just how strong of a control the leadership has on every single facet of life in NK, I believe it truly is a historical first in that respect) and yet, despite entire segments of their population being in open rebellion with whole swathes of the country being under rebels, the insurgency is still in a dire state and it's long term future is unknown in large part because there's zero outside help. \n\nNow consider that in comparison, any attempt at an organized resistance in NK would be swiftly crushed in it's infancy, how the population is kept docile due to their circumstances which prevents the formation of a resistance without the leadership even having to lift a finger, and even if in some alternate reality, an organized, meaningful resistance would come about, they would have to contend with the full force of North Korea, one of the most militarized countries on the planet, who would be heavily aided by China, and the resistance themselves would have no one from the world outside actually helping them. \n\nSo generation after generation, they all simply endure, very few jump the border, a lot of people join the military and some suck up as best they can, all do so to improve their circumstances. People also try to position themselves to be picked for jobs in China and Siberia but there's not much the people can do even if in theory, the people always have the power, in reality, it takes an incredible amount of effort and a lot of luck to exercise that power over the ruling regime that actively built up their system around repressing the peoples' power. \n\nIn the upcoming decade, any real change in NK is bound to only come about via the untimely death of Kim Jong-un and what would emerge following the chaos that would cause is anyone's guess really. A lot of people talk about the military having the power and so they could bring about change as well and that may have been true under the previous Kim, but ever since Kim Jong-un assumed his position, he has been successfully undermining the military's power day after day and today, the military is about as powerless as the people are. \n\nThere are less and less of the people in key positions who served the previous Kims and more and more power is being delegated to the more subservient and less influential politicians of the Party, with the military also taking a backseat to the economy, in sharp contrast with the previous Kim who was a real general pleaser. \n\nThe Kim family also positioned themselves as the only ones who can keep a country like NK together and I think they are right about that. Not only are there no more threats to their power even if there would be any, they would've certainly gained their position from the Kims, their power and wealth would come from the Kims and if the Kims were gone, they would be nobodies, in the the best case scenario that is. So there are no wortwhile challengers to be had who could bring about change in NK, not from the Party, not from the Army, not the people and no outside power either, they really are a country frozen in time in multiple ways.",

First off, NK is one of the most isolated countries in the world if not the most isolated, this presents several problems for any sort of resistance and realizing that they have it bad and could have it better is the least of their issues. </p>\n\n<p>Even if the general consensus is that the outside world is better (which despite the regime&#39;s best attempts, it probably is, it was the case with the population of just about every Warsaw Pact country and that was before the world became truly globalized and when there were a dozen countries sharing the same fate) alright, where to go from here? </p>\n\n<p>Merely expressing that sort of discontentment is highly frowned upon as it is a risky thing to do in most authoritarian states but NK especially has it&#39;s population tightly locked down like no other in history, so resistance for most people stops there and they continue to endure, but say you&#39;re willing to risk your life and for some reason you trust in people who have every reason to betray you, and you somehow manage to form a small group that starts to gain traction, what hope does your resistance have when your numbers and equipment are nowhere near enough but there&#39;s also no one to turn to?</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s no outside force willing to meddle with NK&#39;s internal affairs especially now that their nuclear program is in full force and China would also go against whoever is trying to cause a crisis on their border, even if by some miracle, an inside resistance (that would no doubt be a very small minority of the population, as enduring is simply the best and most rational option for most peope under their circumstances and people would have a hard time organizing resistance in a regime like NK&#39;s) were to form, then what?</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s no one in the world who would show even the slightest support for them beyond empty platitudes, helping them in a useful way would also be practically impossible with how tightly locked down NK is. Take Burma for example, the Tatmadaw runs a country that&#39;s much more open, larger even the terrain is much better for a resistance, and they are a long way from having the iron grip on their population NK&#39;s leadership has (while I don&#39;t talk much about it in this response, this is very important and it&#39;s hard to illustrate just how strong of a control the leadership has on every single facet of life in NK, I believe it truly is a historical first in that respect) and yet, despite entire segments of their population being in open rebellion with whole swathes of the country being under rebels, the insurgency is still in a dire state and it&#39;s long term future is unknown in large part because there&#39;s zero outside help. </p>\n\n<p>Now consider that in comparison, any attempt at an organized resistance in NK would be swiftly crushed in it&#39;s infancy, how the population is kept docile due to their circumstances which prevents the formation of a resistance without the leadership even having to lift a finger, and even if in some alternate reality, an organized, meaningful resistance would come about, they would have to contend with the full force of North Korea, one of the most militarized countries on the planet, who would be heavily aided by China, and the resistance themselves would have no one from the world outside actually helping them. </p>\n\n<p>So generation after generation, they all simply endure, very few jump the border, a lot of people join the military and some suck up as best they can, all do so to improve their circumstances. People also try to position themselves to be picked for jobs in China and Siberia but there&#39;s not much the people can do even if in theory, the people always have the power, in reality, it takes an incredible amount of effort and a lot of luck to exercise that power over the ruling regime that actively built up their system around repressing the peoples&#39; power. </p>\n\n<p>In the upcoming decade, any real change in NK is bound to only come about via the untimely death of Kim Jong-un and what would emerge following the chaos that would cause is anyone&#39;s guess really. A lot of people talk about the military having the power and so they could bring about change as well and that may have been true under the previous Kim, but ever since Kim Jong-un assumed his position, he has been successfully undermining the military&#39;s power day after day and today, the military is about as powerless as the people are. </p>\n\n<p>There are less and less of the people in key positions who served the previous Kims and more and more power is being delegated to the more subservient and less influential politicians of the Party, with the military also taking a backseat to the economy, in sharp contrast with the previous Kim who was a real general pleaser. </p>\n\n<p>The Kim family also positioned themselves as the only ones who can keep a country like NK together and I think they are right about that. Not only are there no more threats to their power even if there would be any, they would&#39;ve certainly gained their position from the Kims, their power and wealth would come from the Kims and if the Kims were gone, they would be nobodies, in the the best case scenario that is. So there are no wortwhile challengers to be had who could bring about change in NK, not from the Party, not from the Army, not the people and no outside power either, they really are a country frozen in time in multiple ways.</p>\n</div>",
