The logic behind the $7.8 billion of PDA authority should entail the following:\n\n* Sending $7.8 billion - at its current depreciated value - worth of weapons to Ukraine,\n* Allocating $7.8 billion in funds to the DoD to replace the provided equipment with new items that align with current DoD priorities.\n\nHere's how I thought it should work: Suppose there's an old piece of equipment in the DoD warehouse, like a very old M113 that was sent to Ukraine, valued at $1 million. This old M113 is considered to have a value of $1 million to the DoD (it is old and out-dated!), not the $5 million cost of a brand-new APC. So, if the President decides to send 5 pcs of old M113s to Ukraine, he would then provide $5 million in funding to the DoD to replace these 5 old vehicles. Now, the DoD faces a choice: it could either purchase 5 old M113s from, say, European stocks, returning to the initial situation of having 5 old M113s in storage. Alternatively, the DoD could spend the $5 million according to its current priorities/needs and acquire a single new APC (since one new APC is more useful to the DoD than 5 old M113s).\n\nThis is how I envisioned it working. Of course, the legislators might have a different mechanism in mind with the bill, possibly like this: Ukraine receives 1 old M113, the DoD gets $5 million to buy 1 new APC as a replacement for the donated M113. So, in the end, Ukraine has 1x M113, 4x old M113s remain in the DoD warehouse, and 1x new APC is ordered to replenish the DoD's stocks.",

Also Sirsky WAS Zaluzhny's responsibility, he was the one commanding the entirety of the Ukranian army yet he did not fire him, I don't know if his options were limited due political meddling but he needed to fire a lot of people but never did.\n\nLet me preface this that I don't think Zaluzhny is a good strategist at all, I think he's bad actually. There are things he seems to do well, largely involving basic concepts of management and administration. \n\nThat out of the way, the problem with the UAF isn't that it has a few Soviet type generals (Syrsky definitely included), it's that most of them were like that before the war started, especially in the general officer ranks, and then they recalled basically everyone alive still healthy enough to wear a uniform and serve as a command or staff officer, and those were even worse. \n\nThere was nothing about the UAF before the war that was actually seriously reforming to become a Western NATO clone army. They were a poorly funded military since the breakup of the Soviet Union, especially through the 1990s and 2000s where they were embarrassingly corrupt and incompetent. Note, that's the exact time period most is the senior and middle officer corps served. They got only a bit better since 2014 because they had too, actually fighting a war, but it was still a military organization kept deliberately small (lack of funding), with a poorly trained officer corps (lack of funding and existing Soviet era military culture), who didn't focus on things like offensive operations because, let's be real, nobody in a million years thought they'd be in a position to launch corps sized offensives against the Russians until this war started and we realized how shitty the Russian military actually was. \n\nSo who exactly is Zaluzhny supposed to replace?

                    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>The Ukrainian army after almost 2 years under Zaluzhny&#39;s command was not able to get rid of its Soviet Era commanders who value life cheaply and couldn&#39;t establish a good training program for its conscripts. Also Sirsky WAS Zaluzhny&#39;s responsibility, he was the one commanding the entirety of the Ukranian army yet he did not fire him, I don&#39;t know if his options were limited due political meddling but he needed to fire a lot of people but never did.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Let me preface this that I don&#39;t think Zaluzhny is a good strategist at all, I think he&#39;s bad actually. There are things he seems to do well, largely involving basic concepts of management and administration. </p>\n\n<p>That out of the way, the problem with the UAF isn&#39;t that it has a few Soviet type generals (Syrsky definitely included), it&#39;s that most of them were like that before the war started, especially in the general officer ranks, and then they recalled basically everyone alive still healthy enough to wear a uniform and serve as a command or staff officer, and those were even worse. </p>\n\n<p>There was nothing about the UAF before the war that was actually seriously reforming to become a Western NATO clone army. They were a poorly funded military since the breakup of the Soviet Union, especially through the 1990s and 2000s where they were embarrassingly corrupt and incompetent. Note, that&#39;s the exact time period most is the senior and middle officer corps served. They got only a bit better since 2014 because they had too, actually fighting a war, but it was still a military organization kept deliberately small (lack of funding), with a poorly trained officer corps (lack of funding and existing Soviet era military culture), who didn&#39;t focus on things like offensive operations because, let&#39;s be real, nobody in a million years thought they&#39;d be in a position to launch corps sized offensives against the Russians until this war started and we realized how shitty the Russian military actually was. </p>\n\n<p>So who exactly is Zaluzhny supposed to replace? And with who? People act as if there is a large pool of highly competent officers waiting to get promoted to 3-4 stars to take over and perform reforms. There isn&#39;t. The whole reason the UAF can&#39;t form division HQs is a lack of officers. They formed a few corps, and had to strip other organizations of their officers to do it.

Previously he overruled Zaluzhny's recommendations, which was reported by RUSI regarding the defense of the Donbas, the defense of Bakhmut, the importance of Bakhmut during the 2023 Offensive, etc.\n\n>Quite right, but it isn't even remotely relevant.\n\nZelensky ignoring the advice of his senior military advisors is very relevant in a discussion about the professional relationship between Zelensky and his senior military advisors, especially in terms of how Zelensky regularly overrules them.\n\n>I'd like for you to detail, specifically, why that is pinned on him, aside from the fact he was the top commander.  Ukraine of 2015 was a ragtag soviet army, the entire situation was a mess which devolved quickly with Russian involvement.\n\nBecause he was literally in charge of the operation. Because he planned it and executed it.\n\n>I wouldn't trust relevant information to have even been available to him. Shit does happen in war.\n\nThe battle of Debaltseve occurred over a month and the most disastrous aspect about it wasn't that the Russians were involved or that it was encircled, it was that the encirclement took a month to perform and the Ukrainians wouldn't retreat in the process until the last minute, at which it became a disorganized rout.\n\nI'm not asking you, because you'll give a bad answer. But anyone else reading this, does any of the following sound familiar?\n\nThe Ukrainians end up in a dangerous encirclement of a city they hold as a tenuous salient, refusing to retreat until the very last minute, taking horrific casualties in the process, and Syrsky is in charge and manages to duck all blame afterwards.\n\n>I'd also like to point out *planning* a strategic failure of epic proportions (Zaluzhny) is entirely different from *reacting* poorly (Syrskyi) to changing battlefield realities.\n\nSyrsky literally planned the defense of both Debaltseve and Bakhmut, and the summer 2023 offense against Bakhmut, which was a stunning failure on the northern flank especially, very much high casualty producing, and a big reason the Ukrainian troops themselves hate him.\n\nThat said, Zaluzhny and his General Staff absolutely botched the planning of the summer offensive. And the two operational strategic grouping of forces commanders and their staff, Syrsky included, absolutely botched their roles in planning and especially executing them.\n\n>Oh come on.\n\nZaluzhny was awesome until Zelensky fired him, now that decision must be properly conveyed so the plebes know the proper narrative they must think. All is well, the best decision was again made, Trust Them.\n\nSure, you know next to nothing about Syrsky, but because Zelensky picked him he must be great. Trust Them.\n\nOceania has always been at war with Eastasia...\n\n**EDIT**: Just on a hunch I went through my post history because I remember you trying to put me into my place by suggesting a Zelensky-Zaluzhny existed back on [January 8th](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/191kp1o/comment/kh52x2w/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) when you told me the following: \n\n*There is an ungodly amount of misinformation going on. You and I are not in a position to accurately judge the political climate of Ukraine, so you shouldn't try. Leave that to people better able to navigate that information jungle.

Maybe you shouldn&#39;t get interested in discussing the Ukraine War on this sub in December 2023 and you would have read them.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>And that means next to nothing in the context of the summer offensive and the preparation leading up to it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Except when he makes military decisions that have ramifications for future operations.</p>\n\n<p>Because clone armies only exists in shitty scifi, if there is a good brigade (let&#39;s call it the 93rd for hypothetical reasons) that is stuck all winter and spring fighting in a high intensity costly battle in some location (let&#39;s call it Bakhmut for hypothetical reasons), by order of the Supreme Commander In Chief, then that unit or others like it can&#39;t be used to prepare to launch an offensive in a different part of the country at the same time.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Unless you&#39;re claiming zelensky bypassed Zaluzhny, in which case, show us some <em>proof</em> for that claim.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You are so absolutely terribly informed.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2023/12/07/rivalry-grows-between-zelensky-and-ukraine-s-top-general_6319891_4.html\">https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2023/12/07/rivalry-grows-between-zelensky-and-ukraine-s-top-general_6319891_4.html</a></p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s been openly reported since December that Zelensky was outright bypassing Zaluzhny. Previously he overruled Zaluzhny&#39;s recommendations, which was reported by RUSI regarding the defense of the Donbas, the defense of Bakhmut, the importance of Bakhmut during the 2023 Offensive, etc.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Quite right, but it isn&#39;t even remotely relevant.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Zelensky ignoring the advice of his senior military advisors is very relevant in a discussion about the professional relationship between Zelensky and his senior military advisors, especially in terms of how Zelensky regularly overrules them.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I&#39;d like for you to detail, specifically, why that is pinned on him, aside from the fact he was the top commander.  Ukraine of 2015 was a ragtag soviet army, the entire situation was a mess which devolved quickly with Russian involvement.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Because he was literally in charge of the operation. Because he planned it and executed it.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I wouldn&#39;t trust relevant information to have even been available to him. Shit does happen in war.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The battle of Debaltseve occurred over a month and the most disastrous aspect about it wasn&#39;t that the Russians were involved or that it was encircled, it was that the encirclement took a month to perform and the Ukrainians wouldn&#39;t retreat in the process until the last minute, at which it became a disorganized rout.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not asking you, because you&#39;ll give a bad answer. But anyone else reading this, does any of the following sound familiar?</p>\n\n<p>The Ukrainians end up in a dangerous encirclement of a city they hold as a tenuous salient, refusing to retreat until the very last minute, taking horrific casualties in the process, and Syrsky is in charge and manages to duck all blame afterwards.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I&#39;d also like to point out <em>planning</em> a strategic failure of epic proportions (Zaluzhny) is entirely different from <em>reacting</em> poorly (Syrskyi) to changing battlefield realities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Syrsky literally planned the defense of both Debaltseve and Bakhmut, and the summer 2023 offense against Bakhmut, which was a stunning failure on the northern flank especially, very much high casualty producing, and a big reason the Ukrainian troops themselves hate him.</p>\n\n<p>That said, Zaluzhny and his General Staff absolutely botched the planning of the summer offensive. And the two operational strategic grouping of forces commanders and their staff, Syrsky included, absolutely botched their roles in planning and especially executing them.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Oh come on.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Zaluzhny was awesome until Zelensky fired him, now that decision must be properly conveyed so the plebes know the proper narrative they must think. All is well, the best decision was again made, Trust Them.</p>\n\n<p>Sure, you know next to nothing about Syrsky, but because Zelensky picked him he must be great. Trust Them.</p>\n\n<p>Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia...</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Just on a hunch I went through my post history because I remember you trying to put me into my place by suggesting a Zelensky-Zaluzhny existed back on <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/191kp1o/comment/kh52x2w/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">January 8th</a> when you told me the following: </p>\n\n<p><em>There is an ungodly amount of misinformation going on.

Trump has long complained about the amount other countries in NATO spend on defense compared with the United States and has repeatedly threatened to withdraw the US from NATO. But his comments Saturday are his most direct indication he does not intend to defend NATO allies from Russian attack if he is reelected.\n\n> Trump has for years inaccurately described how NATO funding works. NATO has a target that each member country spends a minimum of 2% of gross domestic product on defense, and most countries are not meeting that target. But the figure is a guideline and not a binding contract, nor does it create \u201cbills\u201d; member countries haven\u2019t been failing to pay their share of NATO\u2019s common budget to run the organization.\n\n> Republican Sen.

Trump has described NATO as \u201cobsolete\u201d and has aligned himself with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who wants to weaken the alliance. Trump has long praised Putin and went as far as to side with the Russian leader over the US intelligence community over Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\n> This story has been updated with additional developments.\n\n> CNN\u2019s Kaanita Iyer, Daniel Dale, Marshall Cohen, Veronica Stracqualursi, Jim Acosta, Kevin Liptak and Martin Goillandeau contributed to this report.",

But the figure is a guideline and not a binding contract, nor does it create \u201cbills\u201d; member countries haven\u2019t been failing to pay their share of NATO\u2019s common budget to run the organization.</p>\n\n<p>Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, who has endorsed Trump, said Sunday he had \u201czero concerns\u201d about the former president\u2019s NATO comments.</p>\n\n<p>Rubio told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of the Union\u201d that Trump was merely reflecting on an anecdote from his presidency, arguing member nations weren\u2019t \u201cpaying their dues\u201d until Trump \u201cused leverage\u201d to push NATO countries to \u201cstep up to the plate.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cTrump\u2019s just the first one to express it in these terms,\u201d the Florida Republican said.</p>\n\n<p>As president, Trump privately threatened multiple times to withdraw the United States from NATO, according to The New York Times. Trump has described NATO as \u201cobsolete\u201d and has aligned himself with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who wants to weaken the alliance. Trump has long praised Putin and went as far as to side with the Russian leader over the US intelligence community over Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election.</p>\n\n<p>This story has been updated with additional developments.</p>\n\n<p>CNN\u2019s Kaanita Iyer, Daniel Dale, Marshall Cohen, Veronica Stracqualursi, Jim Acosta, Kevin Liptak and Martin Goillandeau contributed to this report.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

It was November, and cold weather had already gripped the east of the country.\n\n>The two soldiers, Oleksandr, 42, and Anatoly, 31, sat quietly together, holding their breath. Oleksandr knew that the hole provided inadequate cover for the two men.\n\n>And as he had feared, a Russian mortar landed right next to the pair on their fifth and last night at the position. Anatoly was struck in the back by shrapnel.\n\n...\n\n> The account of Oleksandr, a soldier with an anti-tank platoon of the 47th Separate Mechanized Brigade, matches other testimony that there are almost no fortified positions on the very front line near Avdiivka \u2013 further threatening the lives of those tasked with defending the city.\n\n...\n\n>The second line of defense, a few kilometers behind the front, is still being built, according to nearly a dozen interviewed soldiers.\n\n...\n\n>\"It is necessary to build a line of defense with trenches, a system of fire points, minefields, etc.,\" Oleksandr explained. \u201cFor us, it's like this: We have trenches, and that's it, it's enough.\u201d\n\n>\"We just need to build a defense line in which they (the Russian troops) would suffer colossal losses. It is being built, but f*ck, if it had been built (earlier)\u2026\"\n\nIt's anecdotal and naturally the guys in the shittiest situation with the worst preparation are going to be the most likely to talk to reporters about it but it's still a grim picture. The rest of the article summarizes the state of the current battle including callbacks to Bakhmut where some of the troops currently in Avdiivka fought previously.

Anatoly was struck in the back by shrapnel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The account of Oleksandr, a soldier with an anti-tank platoon of the 47th Separate Mechanized Brigade, matches other testimony that there are almost no fortified positions on the very front line near Avdiivka \u2013 further threatening the lives of those tasked with defending the city.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The second line of defense, a few kilometers behind the front, is still being built, according to nearly a dozen interviewed soldiers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;It is necessary to build a line of defense with trenches, a system of fire points, minefields, etc.,&quot; Oleksandr explained. \u201cFor us, it&#39;s like this: We have trenches, and that&#39;s it, it&#39;s enough.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We just need to build a defense line in which they (the Russian troops) would suffer colossal losses. It is being built, but f*ck, if it had been built (earlier)\u2026&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It&#39;s anecdotal and naturally the guys in the shittiest situation with the worst preparation are going to be the most likely to talk to reporters about it but it&#39;s still a grim picture. The rest of the article summarizes the state of the current battle including callbacks to Bakhmut where some of the troops currently in Avdiivka fought previously. Finally the article ends with a discussion of how the current shell hunger affects the battle.</p>\n</div>",

            "body": "So it can be complicated. Generally, bills in the House are straight majority. Very little is done there that isn't pure majority. In the Senate, most work is done by straight majority but you need a 2/3rds vote to invoke 'cloture' which just means ending the debate period. Any time there is a debate, you need to 2/3rds. And I believe any one Senator can hold up the process to *start* debate. So its generally a tough rule to overcome. But its not the only time, or the final time, a bill gets a vote. Typically bills will move through a series of procedural votes which in most cases are actually 100-0 or some similarly overwhelming number. This remains up until the final version of the bill is submitted for debate and amendment, you get amendments added and voted on, then debate on all the amendments, then the end of debate, then onto a final majority only vote. The bill must clear every hurdle to be approved by the body. Which obviously means you need to cross the 60 vote debate threshold every time (with the exception of *some* budget bills, but not all). \n\nSo the current aid bill has had a successful cloture vote, meaning debate is *over*. Now all it needs is a majority only vote to become law, which should be procedural and not a big deal. Next the House will have to take up the bill. The House works almost entirely off of a simple majority, so theoretically it should pass *if* its brought to the floor. But the power of the Speaker includes total control over what will and will not get floor votes, there are a hundred ways to kill a bill in the House if Johnson doesn't want the bill to pass. Typically the standard applied is that if the majority of the members of the majority party want a bill to be voted on, it comes to the floor. But in reality, the Speaker doesn't have to do shit if they dont want to. Johnson's only fear will be a motion to vacate based on failing to bring forward the Senate bill. Basically he could lose the Speakership, which would be bad for him. With one vote required for the motion, its a real possibility. Of course MTG has already threatened a motion if the bill *is* brought to the floor, so that leaves Johnson in a bind. Politically the question for him is who is more dangerous to his position, moderates or MAGA. The goal is going to be to *not* have a discharge motion, as such a thing could be disastrous in an election year. But if moderates grow a spine, Johnson could be between a rock and a crazy place. BTW a Speaker only needs a majority of the *House* not a majority of the majority party, so there are some tricks that could save, or damn, Johnson depending on how this plays out. \n\n*Assuming* the bill comes to the floor, its probably the case that it passes pretty convincingly. I think Dems will snap up a clean Nat Sec bill like this. *If* the House passes a NatSec bill, any bill, the two bills will go to a conference. Any differences will be reconciled and the bodies-revote on the updated bills. I dont *think* this has to be done if the bills are already identical, *but* it could be thorny if the House somehow squeezes in a last minute amendment.",

That&#39;s what happened with the Israel bill. </p>\n\n<p>If the Senate sends a bill and the House sends it to a Committee which doesn&#39;t move it to the floor, House members can file a discharge petition to recall it from the committee and send it straight to the floor. However, the discharge petition must be submitted by 218 members. So basically, a majority of the House must already have said they will vote for it to get it to the floor.</p>\n</div>",

I can't imagine Trump and more importantly the people under Trump that have a vastly better understanding of Geopolitics would follow through on that. Even more because the USA can't be trusted again. \nI kinda hope that people with more sense than him will somehow take the wheel when it gets serious but at the same time I'm getting more and more anxious because I still can't believe they even consider to vote for this dementia riddled criminal that is in the process of selling out his country to live his last 5-10 years on a power trip.",
