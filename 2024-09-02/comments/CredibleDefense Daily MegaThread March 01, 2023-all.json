They&#39;re clearly skimping out on maintenance training, which compounds the issue of just not having the physical capacity to maintain the gear in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>But aside from those two major sticking points, Ukraine has managed to use most vehicles they&#39;re given to good effect, sometimes to great effect.  They&#39;ve taken great care to minimize battlefield kills on S-tier western gear, and captures are even less common.</p>\n</div>",

And even more steep in the mid-term, as a result of the lack of access to technology and investment,\u201d Birol told Reuters.**\n\n>International restrictions imposed on Russia in response to the Ukraine war, including a $60 a barrel crude price cap imposed by Group of Seven countries, have left Russia\u2019s Urals blend being sold at a heavy discount to Brent.\n\n>The 27-country European Union also banned Russian seaborne oil imports from December, and has placed sanctions on exports to Russia of technologies needed for oil refining. The United States and Britain have also imposed restrictions on Russian oil imports.\n\n>Moscow relies on income from oil and gas - last year around 11.6 trillion roubles ($154.68 billion) - to fund its budget spending, and has been forced to start selling international reserves to cover a deficit widened by the cost of its invasion of Ukraine.\n\n>Europe is meanwhile racing to wean itself off Russian gas, after Moscow cut pipeline deliveries to the EU following its Feb. 2022 invasion of Ukraine. That pushed European gas prices to record highs and left countries struggling to find alternative supplies and launch energy-saving measures.\n\n>Birol said EU countries made progress in improving energy security last year, including a rapid expansion of renewable energy and heat pumps to reduce the need for fossil fuels.\n\n>But he said risks remain, and countries needed to keep up efforts to save energy and safeguard supplies. Europe\u2019s ability to secure enough gas could be challenged by rising demand from China, or if Russia cuts off the gas it still sends to Europe.\n\n>\u201cWe have all the reasons to be as hard-working as last year,\u201d Birol said.

Russia benefitted greatly from the sky-high energy prices of last year, but this year its highly unlikely prices will be anywhere near that high and Russia will have to sell its energy at a discount below those prices, and on top of that, they're not going to be able to sell nearly as much gas and oil to Asia as they did to Europe pre-invasion. \n\nThat the IEA expects Russian oil and gas revenues to drop further, while the cost of producing those fuels is likely to rise (due to a lack of Western advisors and equipment), must be a huge blow to Russia's sputtering economy.",

Regardless:\n\n*Anonymous Officer 1 (the most contrarian one), currently training Ukrainian mobilized troops because he wants to help fix the situation:*\n\n- The current training situation for mobilized troops is terrible. Ukrainians should take their time to train for flanking and maneuvering tactics; many officers are too stuck in the trench warfare and broad front combat mindset from the last 8 years (it is experience, for sure, but not the right kind).\n\n- Ukrainians have an immense will to fight and win, and are very confident, but these tactics do not cut it. To put it mildly, he is pessimistic about taking back Crimea and 2014-> Donbass, and would view it as a \"defensive victory\" to take back February borders. Thinks the media is too optimistic.\n\n- Officer 1 appreciates the work of US/UK SOF in training Ukrainians, but thinks that their model is not the right one for this war. He believes Finland has the world's most refined anti-Russian tactics, and that no other country has that sort of a \"muddy boots\" low tech proficiency that the situation calls for; thinks there are plenty of Finnish reserve officers that would be happy to join him for a low compensation. Sees the Finnish model of training as the single most cost-effective form of aid Ukraine could get.\n\n- Ukrainian officers have given his ideas approval pricately, but believe it is below their pay grade to spread them and don't seem to react much; Officer 1 attributes this to the Soviet legacy of institutional friction. However, he also says the military has become more receptive to training reform recently, especially younger officers.",

With the family\u2019s budget stretched, the choices are no easier when it comes to food or durables.\n\n>\u201cYou simply don\u2019t know where to go,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe with time, more shops will open and we\u2019ll find replacements.\u201d\n\n>For all of President Vladimir Putin\u2019s upbeat talk of expecting \u201csome growth\u201d across the board this year, retail sales remain in a contraction that\u2019s already more drawn out than its declines during the global pandemic.\n\n>The downturn represents what Bloomberg Economics says is a \u201cpermanent drop\u201d in living standards, similar to the impoverishment and a record stretch of shrinking retail sales in the years after the 2014 annexation of Crimea. The consumer sector accounts for about half the economy.\n\n>It\u2019s a stark contrast to the resilience of an economy that endured a year of sanctions with a much shallower recession that first expected. \n\n>Though panic shopping supported consumption in the weeks following the invasion a year ago, it\u2019s since flat-lined deep below zero and stayed there to start this year, with household spending projected to drop every quarter in 2023, according to forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n>Data on Wednesday showed retail sales in January shrank for a 10th straight month, a stretch longer than their crash at the height of the pandemic in 2020. Still, their annual drop of 6.6% was much smaller than forecast by economists. \n\n>Real wages were close to unchanged in December but declined 1% for the year as a whole.\n\n>\u201cRetail is one of the sectors of the economy that was hurt the most last year,\u201d said Olga Belenkaya, an economist at Finam.

With the family\u2019s budget stretched, the choices are no easier when it comes to food or durables.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou simply don\u2019t know where to go,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe with time, more shops will open and we\u2019ll find replacements.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>For all of President Vladimir Putin\u2019s upbeat talk of expecting \u201csome growth\u201d across the board this year, retail sales remain in a contraction that\u2019s already more drawn out than its declines during the global pandemic.</p>\n\n<p>The downturn represents what Bloomberg Economics says is a \u201cpermanent drop\u201d in living standards, similar to the impoverishment and a record stretch of shrinking retail sales in the years after the 2014 annexation of Crimea. The consumer sector accounts for about half the economy.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s a stark contrast to the resilience of an economy that endured a year of sanctions with a much shallower recession that first expected. </p>\n\n<p>Though panic shopping supported consumption in the weeks following the invasion a year ago, it\u2019s since flat-lined deep below zero and stayed there to start this year, with household spending projected to drop every quarter in 2023, according to forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.</p>\n\n<p>Data on Wednesday showed retail sales in January shrank for a 10th straight month, a stretch longer than their crash at the height of the pandemic in 2020. Still, their annual drop of 6.6% was much smaller than forecast by economists. </p>\n\n<p>Real wages were close to unchanged in December but declined 1% for the year as a whole.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cRetail is one of the sectors of the economy that was hurt the most last year,\u201d said Olga Belenkaya, an economist at Finam. Savings in banks at home and abroad surged by 5.7 trillion rubles ($76 billion) last year, she said, comparable to the record during the pandemic and almost double the total in 2021.</p>\n\n<p>After signs of consumer revival in January, high-frequency estimates of nominal spending showed a deceleration and then a drop in recent weeks.

Considering just how overstretched and poorly supported the Russians on the right bank of the river were, the Ukrainians didn&#39;t exactly cover themselves with glory during their campaign to evict the Russians. But don&#39;t take my word for it, Kofman says literally the same things I am. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I&#39;d rather snarkily say serious things than say &quot;by any stretch of the imagination, the Kherson offensive didn&#39;t go well for Ukraine&quot; with a perfectly straight face. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Again, Kofman has been saying literally the same things I have. The Kherson offensive was costly, it was messy, and it wasn&#39;t impressive tactically or operationally. You know how you keep bringing up the Russian failures around Vuhledar? Well the Ukrainians had a horrible time with mines in Kherson too, it&#39;s why they weren&#39;t able to pursue the Russians while they slowly evacuated tens of thousands of troops across a major river. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In your case, it will change literally nothing. Ukraine has prosecuted multiple heavy offensives at this point and you&#39;re literally as convinced that Ukraine is offensively ineffective as people were last March.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I do love it when you tell me what I think, despite the fact that I&#39;ve never said anything even approaching that, nor do I believe that. But please do go on, what else do I think?</p>\n</div>",

Sure, they had supply issues, but this was a lot of manpower, including (at the time) high quality units such as the VDV, in open fields where they could use air support.

This is a lesson that the Ukrainian armed forces desperately need to learn.\n\n**KIOVA** Now that Russian military forces have been stumbling in Ukraine for a year, most Ukrainians and Finns believe in a Ukrainian victory.\n\nIt's unquenchable hope, says a senior Finnish officer who has been following the war on the ground since last April.\n\nThe officer believes that Ukrainian troops do not know how to attack and their training is backward, as if straight from the Soviet Union.\n\n- Ukrainians think they are good soldiers. But being in the trenches for eight years, scared, does not make you a good soldier. Training makes a soldier,\" the officer says.\n\nThat is why the Finnish officer has taken it upon himself to improve the training of Ukrainian soldiers, especially non-commissioned officers.\n\nHe does not want to appear in public with his name and face. According to the officer, his military rank in Ukraine could even raise eyebrows in Russia, even though he is no longer in permanent service in Finland and does not represent Finland.\n\nAnonymity also allows him to be exceptionally frank about the situation.\n\nHis identity is known to Yle. Yle met him in January in Kiev, the capital of Ukraine.\n\nThe officer is a war dissident, as many Western experts believe in Ukraine's military success. In his interview with Yle, the officer shatters many of the established perceptions of the war.\n\nIn his view, the only thing that has saved Ukraine so far is that Russia has made equally bad mistakes. But Russia's mistakes are not worth gloating over.\n\n- Russian troops have learned their lesson, but Ukrainians have not,\" he says.\n\n## Officer: the losses in Ukraine and Russia are equally heavy\n\nThe officer says the level of competence of the Ukrainian armed forces is embarrassingly low - and the more he has seen of it, the worse he thinks it is.\n\n- Very poor leadership, poor tactical and combat engineering skills. They have taken their cue mainly from video games and movies,\" says the officer.\n\nWhat is particularly fatal for the continuation of the war is that, in the officer's view, Ukrainian troops are incapable of fast-paced mobile warfare. That is why the war has become bogged down in old-fashioned positional warfare, in which the enemy soldiers are killed by artillery.\n\n- The Ukrainian offensive is a frontal assault. You don't know how to hook,\" says the officer.\n\nThe officer says it is easier to lead a frontal assault, but the result is a barely moving front line and huge losses. The cost of an armed war is high for both sides, but Ukraine has fewer reserves than Russia.\n\nBased on the information he has gathered from the front, the officer estimates that Ukraine's losses in the war will be on a par with Russia's.\n\nAccording to Ukraine's official estimate, Russia has already lost about 150 000 soldiers in the war, but Western estimates are lower. Ukraine does not report its own losses.\n\n## Ukrainian counter-attacks \"a stroke of luck\"\n\nUkraine has, of course, regained some of the territory that Russia seized at the beginning of its major offensive in Kiev, Kharkiv and Kherson.\n\n- Those were lucky breaks, the officer says.\n\nThe officer criticises the Ukrainians for not trying to surround the Russians. Defeating the invader by a blockade would save towns and cities by not having to bomb buildings to the ground, as happened, for example, in the north-western suburbs of Kiev last spring.\n\nAccording to the officer, the north-western part of Kiev would also have been an excellent area for guerrilla operations, but Ukraine did not use this method. Moreover, the use of mines would have stopped the Russian attack more quickly.\n\nIn the officer's opinion, Russia's withdrawal was due more to its own mistakes than to Ukraine's merits.\n\nIn the case of Kharkiv, Russia had left a gap in the front, which was mainly filled by rebels from the Donbas. Ukraine took the eastern part of Kharkiv quickly and almost without fighting, because the few soldiers of the opposing side fled.\n\nRussia also withdrew from Kherson with almost no resistance. The Russian withdrawal was mainly due to the destruction by Ukraine of the bridges over the Dnieper River, which made it impossible to supply the troops.\n\nNow the same lack of bridges is preventing Ukraine from attacking the eastern bank of the river. And Ukraine has not attacked elsewhere either.\n\n- It seems that Russia has the initiative. You could almost say that Ukraine is losing the war if nothing decisive happens,\" the officer says.\n\n## Officer: if Crimea is threatened, Russia would use a nuclear weapon\n\nAccording to the officer, it is wishful thinking that Ukraine will ever retake Crimea.\n\n- Ukraine is unlikely to even get Donbas, so if they could even get to the starting point, it would be a combat victory, the officer says.\n\nThe officer says the main problem is not a lack of weapons but the fact that the Ukrainian armed forces are simply not competent enough.\n\n- The Ukrainians have a terrible will and desire to win, but they will not succeed with this kind of warfare. I have not seen any signs of that,\" the officer says.\n\nHe points out that Crimea is of particular importance to Russia.\n\n- Russia will not lose this war because Russia is a nuclear power. If Ukraine were to launch a major attack on Crimea, Russia would probably use a tactical nuclear weapon, the officer says.\n\nHe believes that as a result of the war, Ukraine will have to give up the territories that Russia has occupied, because it would be too difficult to evict Russian soldiers.\n\n- This is not the end of Ukraine, but the border will change. We have to accept that, as we did in the Winter War. Nothing can be done about it, the officer predicts.",

But Russia&#39;s mistakes are not worth gloating over.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Russian troops have learned their lesson, but Ukrainians have not,&quot; he says.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Officer: the losses in Ukraine and Russia are equally heavy</h2>\n\n<p>The officer says the level of competence of the Ukrainian armed forces is embarrassingly low - and the more he has seen of it, the worse he thinks it is.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Very poor leadership, poor tactical and combat engineering skills. They have taken their cue mainly from video games and movies,&quot; says the officer.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>What is particularly fatal for the continuation of the war is that, in the officer&#39;s view, Ukrainian troops are incapable of fast-paced mobile warfare. That is why the war has become bogged down in old-fashioned positional warfare, in which the enemy soldiers are killed by artillery.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Ukrainian offensive is a frontal assault. You don&#39;t know how to hook,&quot; says the officer.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The officer says it is easier to lead a frontal assault, but the result is a barely moving front line and huge losses. The cost of an armed war is high for both sides, but Ukraine has fewer reserves than Russia.</p>\n\n<p>Based on the information he has gathered from the front, the officer estimates that Ukraine&#39;s losses in the war will be on a par with Russia&#39;s.</p>\n\n<p>According to Ukraine&#39;s official estimate, Russia has already lost about 150 000 soldiers in the war, but Western estimates are lower. Ukraine does not report its own losses.</p>\n\n<h2>Ukrainian counter-attacks &quot;a stroke of luck&quot;</h2>\n\n<p>Ukraine has, of course, regained some of the territory that Russia seized at the beginning of its major offensive in Kiev, Kharkiv and Kherson.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Those were lucky breaks, the officer says.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The officer criticises the Ukrainians for not trying to surround the Russians. Defeating the invader by a blockade would save towns and cities by not having to bomb buildings to the ground, as happened, for example, in the north-western suburbs of Kiev last spring.</p>\n\n<p>According to the officer, the north-western part of Kiev would also have been an excellent area for guerrilla operations, but Ukraine did not use this method. Moreover, the use of mines would have stopped the Russian attack more quickly.</p>\n\n<p>In the officer&#39;s opinion, Russia&#39;s withdrawal was due more to its own mistakes than to Ukraine&#39;s merits.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of Kharkiv, Russia had left a gap in the front, which was mainly filled by rebels from the Donbas. Ukraine took the eastern part of Kharkiv quickly and almost without fighting, because the few soldiers of the opposing side fled.</p>\n\n<p>Russia also withdrew from Kherson with almost no resistance. The Russian withdrawal was mainly due to the destruction by Ukraine of the bridges over the Dnieper River, which made it impossible to supply the troops.</p>\n\n<p>Now the same lack of bridges is preventing Ukraine from attacking the eastern bank of the river. And Ukraine has not attacked elsewhere either.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It seems that Russia has the initiative. You could almost say that Ukraine is losing the war if nothing decisive happens,&quot; the officer says.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Officer: if Crimea is threatened, Russia would use a nuclear weapon</h2>\n\n<p>According to the officer, it is wishful thinking that Ukraine will ever retake Crimea.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Ukraine is unlikely to even get Donbas, so if they could even get to the starting point, it would be a combat victory, the officer says.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The officer says the main problem is not a lack of weapons but the fact that the Ukrainian armed forces are simply not competent enough.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Ukrainians have a terrible will and desire to win, but they will not succeed with this kind of warfare. I have not seen any signs of that,&quot; the officer says.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>He points out that Crimea is of particular importance to Russia.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Russia will not lose this war because Russia is a nuclear power. If Ukraine were to launch a major attack on Crimea, Russia would probably use a tactical nuclear weapon, the officer says.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>He believes that as a result of the war, Ukraine will have to give up the territories that Russia has occupied, because it would be too difficult to evict Russian soldiers.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>This is not the end of Ukraine, but the border will change. We have to accept that, as we did in the Winter War. Nothing can be done about it, the officer predicts.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",

                "body": "## Ukraine dominates Western public opinion\n\nThe scenario of territorial loss in Ukraine sounds ominous in Finland and Europe. In the officer's opinion, it is due to unrealistic expectations fuelled by publicity.\n\nAccording to the officer, the West's perception of the war situation depends entirely on the information generated by Ukraine. The other side is not being listened to, which is understandable, given that Russia is lying so blatantly.\n\n- The media is fully involved in Ukrainian propaganda. In a way, it is hype that Ukraine will win, the officer says.\n\nThe officer believes that most of the realism comes from US intelligence, but it's another matter how much of it ends up with the allies.\n\nThe officer believes that even the Finnish leadership does not have a realistic view of the balance of power in the war, because its picture of the situation is based mainly on public sources.\n\n- Marin says the war will end when Russia leaves Ukraine. Not going to happen. Finland is over-optimistic, the officer says.\n\nAccording to the officer, the situation on the front looks very bad for Ukraine. The chances of a Ukrainian counterattack are poor.\n\n- The Ukrainians have not been able to get through the fortified Russian positions anywhere, the officer says.\n\n- If the public were given the real picture, everyone would start to become sceptical. And the will to win would fade. But the truth should be understood, he continues.\n\n## Finnish education would be a perfect fit for Ukraine\n\nThe West is trying to tip the balance of power in Ukraine's favour with massive arms aid. In the officer's view, it is necessary, but not enough.\n\nThe most effective way to change the situation, he says, would be better training of soldiers - and Finnish military training would suit the Ukrainians very well.\n\n- The Finnish army currently has the best training in the world against Russia. We have been practising it for a hundred years, and we have even fought two wars,\" the officer recalls.\n\nThe United States has trained special forces in Ukraine in particular, but the officer does not praise the model.\n\n- No one else has the same expertise in the forest and in the terrain as Finland. That's what we should be training here,\" he says.\n\nFinns have already provided some training in Ukraine. But it has been on a small scale and on a voluntary basis. According to the officer, there would be plenty of willing instructors in Finland if the Ukrainian and Finnish defence ministries could agree.\n\n- There would be a cloudless supply of reservists. Financially, it would be a piece of cake, the officer says - a pittance.\n\nIncreasing military training would be the most cost-effective way to help the Ukrainians, he says.\n\n- That's why I'm here now, because it's a pity how poorly trained rank and file soldiers and non-commissioned officers are sent to the front, and they come back in a coffin,\" the officer says.\n\n## Attitude problem among Ukrainians makes education more difficult\n\nIn training, however, the officer has encountered a surprisingly tough problem: it is very difficult to learn new things in Ukraine.\n\n- If you start telling Ukrainians about another option, the Ukrainians take it as a criticism and immediately start defending it. \"The capacity to take criticism is really bad,\" the officer says.\n\nIn this respect, Russia and Ukraine follow the same traditions.\n\n- It's a Soviet system where you just do what you're told,\" he says.\n\nThe Ukrainian military interpreter used by the officer has indeed reiterated that Finns should not be so blunt.\n\nThe hierarchy of the organisation causes more problems. Lower-ranking officers are afraid to suggest changes to their superiors because it would be seen as a criticism.\n\n- Captains and majors tell me that it's a good idea, but their grade is not enough to take it forward,\" the officer laments.\n\nBut change is coming. According to the Finnish officer, young Ukrainian officers and junior officers are finally warming up to the idea of reforming training. This will also give Finland a better chance to start training on Ukrainian soil.\n\n## Finnish soldier: training improved, and Ukraine wins the war\n\nIn Kiev, Yle also met two Finnish soldiers who had participated in the fighting and asked them to assess the skills of the Ukrainian troops. One of them has a rather optimistic view, but the other thinks that the Finnish officer's criticism is right on the mark.\n\nKenneth Gr\u00e4gg says he is working with three Ukrainian battalions on the eastern front, including on training.\n\nIn Gr\u00e4gg's view, the criticism of the Ukrainian officers' military skills is partly justified. Last year, according to Gr\u00e4gg, reserve lieutenants who had attended university were recruited with such poor training that even the recruits knew more.\n\n- It went down the drain, says Gr\u00e4gg, but he says the situation is much brighter now.\n\nGr\u00e4gg also thinks the chain of command has become more flexible. In Ukraine, rank-and-file soldiers are now given more decision-making power in combat situations, and the training of non-commissioned officers has improved.\n\nIn Gr\u00e4gg's view, Ukraine's recent losses are mainly due to the fact that there are so many Russian soldiers as a result of the mobilisation. This was seen, for example, in January when Russia took the town of Soledar.\n\n- We didn't have enough artillery and the Russians came through en masse,\" says Gr\u00e4gg.\n\nHowever, Gr\u00e4gg says that in the future, Russian mobilisation will not work as well because Russia is running out of weapons.\n\n- They can put a million men on the front line by force, but what do they give them? An axe? Gr\u00e4gg asks.\n\nIn Gr\u00e4gg's view, Western arms aid to Ukraine is changing the balance of power. If Ukraine receives tanks, howitzers and F-16 fighters from the West, Gr\u00e4gg predicts that the war will end in Ukrainian victory by Midsummer.\n\n## Finnish fighter: \"No idea how to move under fire\"\nAnother Finnish soldier in Ukraine does not want to be identified in public, so he will be called Erk in this story. Yle also met him in Kiev at the end of January, and his identity is known to Yle.\n\nErk believes that Ukraine cannot continue to fight Russia with the same Soviet military doctrine as it has had up to now, because Russia has more soldiers in the longer term.\n\n- The Ukrainians are fighting a lot of trench warfare and have no idea of an invasion, Erkki says.\n\nAccording to Erkki, Ukraine's biggest problem is the lack of team leaders and team leader training, which leads to poor communication and confusion in combat situations.\n\n- The Ukrainians have no idea how to take cover and move under fire,\" says Erkki. For example, soldiers just advance straight ahead and don't aim properly.\n\nHe says the fighting shows a lack of initiative and even the preparation is not effective.\n\n- When soldiers are in barracks, they just lie around when they should be training,\" says Erkki.\n\nThe contrast with Erkki's own training during his military service is stark.\n\nAll three Finns agree on one thing: Finnish military training is the best in the world and should therefore now also be offered to Ukraine.",

First of all, VKS does regularly conduct CAS and interdiction against Ukrainian forces. Not everywhere, not to the great effect, but the frontline is being struck daily.

But it would provide an ability to hurt VKS and also do SEAD attacks much more efficiently. This would degrade VKS ability to attack, thin their AD, make them more cautious and passive.

Mobile air defense against Russian bombers and fighters, in case they manage to overcome the ground-based AD in some regions, at some point in the future.\n3. As a long-range air-to-ground weapons carrier. The US/NATO always prioritized air power, so they have more long-range air-to-surface munitions than surface-to-surface ones. Some of these munitions like HARM and JDAM can be adapted to the soviet planes but for others, it's gonna be more problematic. They will also be more survivable than the old Ukrainian planes.\n4. As a counter to Russian helicopters and CAS aircraft that are still flying low on the Russian side of the frontline, flinging unguided rockets as well as Vikhr, LMUR, or Kh-29 missiles toward Ukrainians. Shooting them down is not easy because of the radar horizon and the fact that Ukraine can not put AD systems too close to the front line(because of artillery and Lancets). Modern fighters, armed with long-range missiles with active radar guidance, could fly up to lock onto the low-flying Russians, and launch missiles at them, before dipping back down to avoid Russian AD. Currently they only have semi-active radar guided missiles, so they need to keep illuminating the target until the missile hits, which is risky.\n\nMost of these roles can not be fulfilled by the drones that are in the Western arsenal currently.

Remove the propaganda/partisanship from your assessment of the above statements and try to assess them neutrally.\n\nThere is nothing inherently sinister about them. You are the one applying sinister meaning to them, based on a previously established narrative.\n\nThis is literally how propaganda works. \n\n-----------------------------\n\nseeing as you deleted your last comment\n\n> Why\u2019d you cherry pick the Ukrainian claims to try and make it look like it\u2019s only one side talking about this?\n\nI didn't cherry pick. You're just completely missing my point.\n\nThe ukrainian claims can easily be confirmed by contrasting them with russian figures. Why do you think that is?\n\nIt's because they're not hiding anything. There is no secret.\n\nGiven that they are not hiding it and are actively promoting it, the foundational, core starting position of this discussion is that the russian government is *bragging* to the world about committing a genocide. You have to believe that the russian government is so irredeemably evil that they would brag about genocide for this discussion to even take place.\n\nEven the Nazis made significant efforts to cover up their genocide. So again, the starting point of this discussion is that russia in 2022 is possibly the most evil government/ population in modern history.\n\nHow can you not see how outrageous that is?",

                                "body": "> The arguments i've seen rely in a bizarre interpretation of putin's 'one people' statement\n\nWhat's so bizarre about it? Are you aware of the context of the \"all-Russian\" nation, wherein all Eastern Slavs are Russian and should use the Russian standard language? The equivalent is forcibly converting Canadians into Americans, so that in the end \"Canadian\" is no longer an equivalent identity to \"American\" (like French, Japanese...) but a subidentity (like Californian, Southerner..)\n\nThe very terminology is difficult though. Historically, \"Great Russian\" (Great being geographical) was at the scope of \"Ukrainian\" (at various times Ruthenian/Rusyn, Little Russian...), and Russian was an umbrella term for them all. In Soviet times, Russian came to mean only \"Great Russian\" and others were raised up - yet the status of Russian stayed the same. So now the Russian state would make everyone \"Russian\" or \"common Russian\" as before.\n\n> If you consider them to be of the same group then how can you be trying to destroy another group? \n\nFrom the coiner of the term Lemkin's famous quote:\n\n> By \"genocide\" we mean the destruction of a nation or of an ethnic group ... genocide does not necessarily mean the immediate destruction of a nation ... signify a coordinated plan of different actions aiming at the destruction of essential foundations of the life of national groups, with the aim of annihilating the groups themselves. The objectives of such a plan would be disintegration of the political and social institutions, of culture, language, national feelings, religion\n\nForcing a group to become part of your own is genocide as it kills that group.\n\nThe deaf community is strongly against cochlear implants, which in the vast majority of cases enable them to hear. Many say widespread adoption would be genocide against the community - because they would fall into general society, no longer using sign language (so their literature, idioms etc. would disappear), attending deaf schools, interacting in their same ways etc. As an outsider this seems very strange: \"but you can solve deafness and be normal!\"\n\nHere, the equivalent is: \"why don't they want to speak and be Russian? We have a great advanced and scientific culture, and they have some folk dances!\" As a Russian speaker, I admit to thinking such things. The same happens with minority languages and communities all over the world e.g. in France cf. \"Vergonha\" or even Weber's \"From Peasants to Frenchman\" (it's crazy to see 18th and 19th century documents showing under half of European France speaking French [1] ) - and remember that Ukrainians in living memory had their language and culture qua separate, non-Russian, shaped in favor of Russian. (The topic of Ukrainian language oppression is difficult due to polarization, certainly people could use it at school etc. but looking at the statistics they largely stopped, textbooks stopped being published etc. into the 80s.)\n\nFoibles on the intentionalist nature of the curicula and children educated in Russia don't matter when the Russian state openly states it wants to genocide Ukrainians. If the argument is that they are too incompetent to persecute a war to enable it, that doesn't make it better.\n\nAs the nobelprize winner Brodsky wrote:\n \n    \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u0432\u044b \u0445\u0440\u0438\u043f\u0435\u0442\u044c, \u0446\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043f\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0439 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0430,\n    \u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0438 \u0438\u0437 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0430, \u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0431\u0440\u0435\u0445\u043d\u044e \u0422\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0430.\n\nEssentially: Dying, you'll think of Pushkin's wisdom, not Shevchenko's crap.\n\n\n\n----------\n\n[1] This revolutionary era document talks about the need to make the other 7/8ths of France speak French.

Are you aware of the context of the \"all-Russian\" nation, wherein all Eastern Slavs are Russian and should use the Russian standard language? The equivalent is forcibly converting Canadians into Americans, so that in the end \"Canadian\" is no longer an equivalent identity to \"American\" (like French, Japanese...) but a subidentity (like Californian, Southerner..)\n\nI'm familiar with the concept, but i see it through another lens.\n\n-------------------\n\nAs background to my point I'm of a strong belief that when it comes to particular countries (especially China and Russia) we have (for a wide variety of cultural and historic reasons) an irrational tendency to interpret *literally everything* through an extreme partisan lens, meaning that anything they say or do is by default interpreted in the most negative and sinister way possible. That fundamental basis to our 'collective worldview' is objectively silly and deeply damaging to measured discourse and mutual understanding. It means we have an extreme, irrational perception of what these countries are and how they function. Essentially we might as well be discussing some invented boogeyman a lot of the time. Is putin/russia a deeply honest and trustworthy person/state? No. Does that mean that literally everything putinor the russian government says is a lie? also no, yet that the starting point. Trump or Johnson both lie to insane amounts, but we don't automatically assume they're lying, because we know better.\n\n---------------\n\n>> I am confident that true sovereignty of Ukraine is possible only in partnership with Russia. Our spiritual, human and civilizational ties formed for centuries and have their origins in the same sources, they have been hardened by common trials, achievements and victories. Our kinship has been transmitted from generation to generation. It is in the hearts and the memory of people living in modern Russia and Ukraine, in the blood ties that unite millions of our families. Together we have always been and will be many times stronger and more successful. For we are one people.\n\nSo this is what he said that apparently 'denies the existence of ukrainian people'. The fact that he repeatedly acknowledges ukraine is apparently irrelevant. I'm sure you would find (pre war anyway) a significant number of ukrainians who agreed with the above statement. the two countries do have long ties because they've mostly been part of the same country or union for 2 centuries.\n\nRegarding his weird 'letter' on the whole, it was just entirely ill-conceived. I'm not sure what he was hoping to achieve by writing it, because it was quite a poor idea. His long winded speeches and his letter strike me as someone that is far too emotionally involved and needs to take a step back.\n\n--------------------\n\nI've explained it before, but my stance is that the 'one people' statement is perfectly in line with the beliefs of someone who feels a sort of unity with their neighbours and regrets the breakup of their former 'union'. As an Englishman, were scotland to vote for independence i would still consider us 'one people' until the day i died, because that's how i feel and all i've ever known. That doesn't mean i don't think scotland is a real place with its own distinct identity (I'm currently living here). Identity is a complicated thing that most people don't have to engage with until it happens. I had a weird identity crisis following brexit, because suddenly i'd been stripped of my 'common european identity'.\n\nMaybe it's something quite unique though because both the USSR and UK are unions of countries and they have their own quirks. There are plenty of English nationalists that won't share my 'british' identity. And plenty of scottish nationalists that also won't (those who want independence obviously) and see the english as oppressors (nationalists tend to be quite predictable. The english nationalists considered the EU oppressors too). But the point is more broadly that 2 people can have entirely contrasting identities and perceptions of the relationship without either of those being invalid. That ukrainian nationalists disagree with putin is perfectly fine, but it doesn't make his view somehow illegitimate or even inherently threatening... unless you decide to interpret it from a very specific perspective.\n\n> The very terminology is difficult though. Historically, \"Great Russian\" (Great being geographical) was at the scope of \"Ukrainian\" (at various times Ruthenian/Rusyn, Little Russian...), and Russian was an umbrella term for them all. In Soviet times, Russian came to mean only \"Great Russian\" and others were raised up - yet the status of Russian stayed the same. So now the Russian state would make everyone \"Russian\" or \"common Russian\" as before.\n\nIt's a weird hangup from the pre-ussr days when it was all just russia I guess. So you have those two competing dynamics or it all being 'russia' (we have a tendency to refer to the USSR as russia quite often ourselves), but also being a different country.\n\nThere's obviously an element of 'regional superiority', but doesn't the same exist in every country?\n\n------------------------------------\n\n> From the coiner of the term Lemkin's famous quote:\n\n>> By \"genocide\" we mean the destruction of a nation or of an ethnic group ... genocide does not necessarily mean the immediate destruction of a nation ... signify a coordinated plan of different actions aiming at the destruction of essential foundations of the life of national groups, with the aim of annihilating the groups themselves. The objectives of such a plan would be disintegration of the political and social institutions, of culture, language, national feelings, religion\n\nWe run into several problems which i have also previously written about. The main one is the big differences between the 'perceptions' of what may amount to genocide and the legal definition of it, which is (in my view) still too broad, but is a lot narrower. A big discussion point in recent years has been 'cultural genocide', which is well outside the scope of the legal definition (as in... it's not a crime under any legal basis) and has a definition so broad that you could credibly argue that the 'war on terror' was a global genocidal rampage; after all it explicitly sought to destroy an entire belief system. You also run into other uncomfortable problems such as... the Ukrainian language policy and various 'anticommunist' laws would also amount to genocide if that is the standard we are applying.\n\nAt the time the convention was being drawn up, the soviets (understandably. gotta fill those gulags) removed things like political affiliation from the groups legally regarded as targets for genocide, which does make sense really. I admire Lemkins sentiment, but i think that from a legal perspective it needs to be much more narrowly defined. Mostly because lumping political repression and the literal holocaust under the same umbrella just doesn't make much sense and devalues the concept.\n\nAnother problem is the overlap with things like ethnic cleansing, which aren't genocide despite the two regularly being linked (just a mere crime against humanity)\n\n\n---------------------\n\n> Forcing a group to become part of your own is genocide as it kills that group.\n\nAgain we run into a LOT of nuance and complexity.\n\nI'll provide another example to explain what i mean. Many brits are familiar with the tales of how a century ago children in welsh schools were shamed and punished for speaking Welsh instead of English. This was in fact a key motivator behind the rejuvenation of the Welsh language, which by law children now have to learn in Welsh schools. Now i'd always just assumed that this was the 'evil english' sponsoring repressive anglicisation policies as part of our shameful imperialistic past, because that fit with the easy, obvious narrative that the welsh nationalists (and obviously the scottish ones in their own way) would like to push.\n\nThe problem? There was no anglicisation policy. It was actually done at the behest of the native welsh population because they understood that english was a more useful language for a wide variety of reasons such as providing increased opportunities. I was genuinely shocked to find this out. The point is though, that 'welshness' was being eradicated entirely naturally (via market forces if you will). Some people unaware of the reality still argue that is was an anti-welsh genocide and it certainly fits the bill by the definitions provided. After all, merely being a part of the whole (or maybe if they'd been independent too) there was an eradication of 'welshness', because frankly that's just what happens. The same way that the english themselves coalesced on a broadly shared language and culture (with its distinct regional variants). It's just what happens. This trend is obviously sped up even more by the increased mobility and communication of the modern day. As i alluded to before, even the EU is slowly coalescing towards a shared linguistic and cultural landscape (which in itself is causing a fair amount of nationalist backlash in some places).\n\nThat is all to say, closeness (especially union or shared nationhood) inherently leads to cultural convergence. Even such basic things as possessing a larger/richer population leads to emulation and thus erosion of self for smaller parties. But obviously we wouldn't consider any of the above to be genocide, because they're not.\n\nE: part 2 incoming",

This is why Holodomor *wasn't* a genocide and why the bengal famine *wasn't* a genocide. The conditions were created in both instances for massive levels of death and suffering, but that was a by-product of the wider policy context, not a direct intention and design of the policy. For holodomor, stalin valued his ideological aims above the welfare of his citizens and saw collectivisation as being the outcome that justifies the means - It was pure indifference. For Bengal Churchill was in an existential war and prioritised the motherland above all else meaning resources couldn't be diverted that might undermine the war itself (arguably such efforts would have been in vain anyway). In both cases there *was* plenty of prejudice towards those who suffered, but that wasn't the reasoning behind the decision that caused the suffering.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nI would also say that the discussion is in itself flawed anyway. To my knowledge the vast majority of the children have already been returned to their families. In which case they haven't been 'transferred' from one group to the other anyway. again to my knowledge (i may be wrong) the problem examples tend to be children who were in ukrainian orphanages in occupied territories.\n\nAnd again we run into even greater complexity when we discuss the occupied territories and the issues of sovereignty, nationhood and citizenship. Are children from the LPR/DPR 'ukrainian'? Not as is recognised internationally, but then does that mean that kosovans aren't kosovan? Does that mean that if China killed everyone in Taiwan it wouldn't be Genocide because internationally we recognise the taiwanese as chinese? If they consider themselves to now be russian and russia considers them to be russian then does ukraine still get to claim them? Because that appears to be what is happening in many cases. There are a crazy number of technicalities and 'muddied waters' involved. \n\n\nAs i've stated elsewhere, i see no reason why genocide laws are relevant here. What i see as relevant are the geneva conventions regarding the treatment of children during wartime (articles 24, 50 and 78), because that's what's happening until something significant changes. This lays out standards that i think you could credibly argue Russia hasn't followed, but again it's heavily confused by the points i made just above.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\n\n> The deaf community is strongly against cochlear implants, which in the vast majority of cases enable them to hear. Many say widespread adoption would be genocide against the community - because they would fall into general society, no longer using sign language (so their literature, idioms etc. would disappear), attending deaf schools, interacting in their same ways etc. As an outsider this seems very strange: \"but you can solve deafness and be normal!\"\n\nWell here we get into the exceptionally broad public conception of genocide again. Which also tangentially touches on the public perception of euthanasia. It just ends up getting extremely philosophical really, but the language used just frankly isn't helpful.\n\nIronically this is why 'pro life' people have some perfectly valid arguments (even if i disagree with them). Screening embryos for genetic conditions is very much euthanasia or 'pre-natal' genocide.  Essentially there is the 'mythology' of euthanasia (disgustingly evil) and the reality, which is that we support it in certain circumstances but just pretend it's not what it is (i go back to ukraine's arguable 'cultural genocide' against russian speakers).

'everyone will learn my language anyway so why do i need to bother with a foreign language'. I now seriously regret holding that attitude.

                                        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Which is why we always come back to <em>intent</em> and why <em>intent</em> is at the core of the legal concept of genocide. This is why Holodomor <em>wasn&#39;t</em> a genocide and why the bengal famine <em>wasn&#39;t</em> a genocide. The conditions were created in both instances for massive levels of death and suffering, but that was a by-product of the wider policy context, not a direct intention and design of the policy. For holodomor, stalin valued his ideological aims above the welfare of his citizens and saw collectivisation as being the outcome that justifies the means - It was pure indifference. For Bengal Churchill was in an existential war and prioritised the motherland above all else meaning resources couldn&#39;t be diverted that might undermine the war itself (arguably such efforts would have been in vain anyway). In both cases there <em>was</em> plenty of prejudice towards those who suffered, but that wasn&#39;t the reasoning behind the decision that caused the suffering.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>I would also say that the discussion is in itself flawed anyway. To my knowledge the vast majority of the children have already been returned to their families. In which case they haven&#39;t been &#39;transferred&#39; from one group to the other anyway. again to my knowledge (i may be wrong) the problem examples tend to be children who were in ukrainian orphanages in occupied territories.</p>\n\n<p>And again we run into even greater complexity when we discuss the occupied territories and the issues of sovereignty, nationhood and citizenship. Are children from the LPR/DPR &#39;ukrainian&#39;? Not as is recognised internationally, but then does that mean that kosovans aren&#39;t kosovan? Does that mean that if China killed everyone in Taiwan it wouldn&#39;t be Genocide because internationally we recognise the taiwanese as chinese? If they consider themselves to now be russian and russia considers them to be russian then does ukraine still get to claim them? Because that appears to be what is happening in many cases. There are a crazy number of technicalities and &#39;muddied waters&#39; involved. </p>\n\n<p>As i&#39;ve stated elsewhere, i see no reason why genocide laws are relevant here. What i see as relevant are the geneva conventions regarding the treatment of children during wartime (articles 24, 50 and 78), because that&#39;s what&#39;s happening until something significant changes. This lays out standards that i think you could credibly argue Russia hasn&#39;t followed, but again it&#39;s heavily confused by the points i made just above.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The deaf community is strongly against cochlear implants, which in the vast majority of cases enable them to hear. Many say widespread adoption would be genocide against the community - because they would fall into general society, no longer using sign language (so their literature, idioms etc. would disappear), attending deaf schools, interacting in their same ways etc. As an outsider this seems very strange: &quot;but you can solve deafness and be normal!&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Well here we get into the exceptionally broad public conception of genocide again. Which also tangentially touches on the public perception of euthanasia. It just ends up getting extremely philosophical really, but the language used just frankly isn&#39;t helpful.</p>\n\n<p>Ironically this is why &#39;pro life&#39; people have some perfectly valid arguments (even if i disagree with them). Screening embryos for genetic conditions is very much euthanasia or &#39;pre-natal&#39; genocide.  Essentially there is the &#39;mythology&#39; of euthanasia (disgustingly evil) and the reality, which is that we support it in certain circumstances but just pretend it&#39;s not what it is (i go back to ukraine&#39;s arguable &#39;cultural genocide&#39; against russian speakers). Both terms have a huge amount of baggage (mainly due to the nazis) which really warp discourse and thinking in my opinion. </p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Here, the equivalent is: &quot;why don&#39;t they want to speak and be Russian?

It's not in the same ballpark as what you're looking for, but this article is at least in the same state, [\"The strategic bombing of German cities during World War II and its impact on city growth] (https://academic.oup.com/joeg/article-abstract/4/2/201/861893).\n\nMy own take is that if the country in question was a complete hermit state where the population can't respecialize in a skill and have superSpartan morale, you could look at the following factors to find a floor: Agricultural work force size, internal agricultural production, aggregate caloric intake of entire population and army, and the extent to which casualties cut into the agricultural work force. Something like this would provide a boundary for casualties for a superSpartan hermit state (which can't replace it's farmers) which might be a rule of thumb/boundary for estimating the effect of mass casualties. \n\nBut of course in the real world, complete superSpartan hermit states don't exist.  Dead farmers on the front lines get replaced by spouses, or even children. Trading partners and allies might send food and other necessary goods banking on the future productivity of that economy. So internal production by the labor force wouldn't practically predict how many casualties can be sustained because people can be retrained and external trade can sustain the population to some extent. Moreover, as the total population decreases due to casualties, you frankly don't need as many essential goods as there are few people overall to use them.  The other side of this is that without superSpartan resilience the will of the populace to fight might diminish. \n\nIt would be highly contextual. An early industrial economy with highly distributed farming and craft industry with plenty of prewar surplus might be able to sustain unbelievable losses and high rates of conscription because 70% of the population are small time farmers and craftsmen who can sustain themselves even when there are huge labor losses. Even huge losses in productivity might be enough for them to survive. But as we've seen with the pandemic, a modern economy can have so many essential goods reliant on processes without redundant capacity, and highly dependent on certain types of labor, that if enough of those laborers were mobilized in a short period most people would lack the means of living, e.g., look at what Pol Pot did essentially declaring war on his own country's economy.",
