As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

We have essentially sold down the river to China the production of every type of manufacturing that isn't high end and esoteric. Where China was quite content for decades to direct their societies money towards subsidizing manufacturing, the US has been almost the opposite, ideologues have been convinced that free markets will optimally direct everything so it matters not if our industries collapse. What they have failed to recognize is that nearly every industry has network effects that make concentration profitable. When one factory fails all the factories around it that supply it fail, and the community providing services to it fail, in a cascade. This makes most industry extremely susceptible to even short bursts of outside competition being subsidized.\n\nNow represents a turning point, where the US and really the West could turn things around however. Most industry is becoming automated to levels far surpassing anything before. If there was ever an opportunity to invest in our industrial base and return production to our shores it would be now, because the influence of labor costs is becoming smaller and smaller. But that will explicitly mean a concerted effort to do what China has done, and subsidize the actual physical production of goods here. As the IRA and CHIPS acts have shown, simply providing mass tax breaks to manufacturers in a segment can result in a flurry of activity, and for next to nothing. If you are providing tax breaks to make things that currently aren't made, and they become made because of that, you aren't really losing any money at all because without the tax break there would be nothing to tax. But continuing down that path would require a realization in the public at large that manufacturing is actually worthwhile. There are still tons of people who think that our entire economy can be service based, that the actual production of goods anywhere is not required. I would argue that even setting aside the catastrophic military strategic implications of this at a time when countries like China with the opposite attitude are acting increasingly aggressive, this doesn't make any economic sense either. Even services that provide direction to the physical production of goods such as engineering and scientific research benefit hugely from being co-located near to the where things happen.\n\nTo conclude, American military procurement is a weak shadow of its WW2 peak in many ways because American industry is. We don't make things here to the same degree, crucially we don't mass produce in the same way, and the result is that military procurement mirrors that. The same skillsets and capacities for making toasters and cars back then let us make materials of war cheaply and well. Today, I think even our highest end items like sophisticated fighter jets are held back because we cannot cheaply make millions of important smaller components, and this drives cost up and capabilities down everywhere.",

                    "body": "Huh, I wasn't aware of the connection there. \n\nYeah, its actually very interesting how much similarity the two issues have, draft vs no draft and industrial policy vs laissez faire. In arguing for the draft you kind of have the same arguments, that of people need freedom to decide what they want, that forcing people's decisions leads to bad outcomes etc. But in both cases I think the question is actually put wrong, the question people should be asking is not whether to draft people but what wars we should be involved in the first place. \n\nThe fundamental failure of the youth movement in the Vietnam war became that instead of substantially increasing the power of the American people to prevent bad wars, they just increased the ability of the average person to ignore them. We still kept blundering into bad wars and getting quagmires just as bad, but instead only the poorest and the least educated are forced into them. If anything now we are more likely to get involved in bad wars, because the average person is now more insulated from them than before. It is not your average kids that get shipped off to die, so now fewer people care. \n\nBut with industrial policy, asking whether we should have it at all was likewise the wrong question. We should have instead focused on having better industrial policy. The  period leading to 70's stagflation was marked by poor decisions at the top about the direction the national economy should be directed towards, and so people concluded that nobody should be directing the economy at all.

The focus instead should have been how to better direct things, and I think fundamentally that means less top down decision making and more local democracy.

In arguing for the draft you kind of have the same arguments, that of people need freedom to decide what they want, that forcing people&#39;s decisions leads to bad outcomes etc. But in both cases I think the question is actually put wrong, the question people should be asking is not whether to draft people but what wars we should be involved in the first place. </p>\n\n<p>The fundamental failure of the youth movement in the Vietnam war became that instead of substantially increasing the power of the American people to prevent bad wars, they just increased the ability of the average person to ignore them. We still kept blundering into bad wars and getting quagmires just as bad, but instead only the poorest and the least educated are forced into them.

Four additional ballistic missiles hit the Negev Air Base, but there were no reports of significant damage, the official said.\n\n>A spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces said earlier Sunday that 99% of the 300 \"threats of various types\" Iran launched at Israel, including 120 ballistic missiles and more than 30 cruise missiles, were intercepted by Israel's air defense system and Israeli Air Force fighter jets, as well as \"aerial defense systems and aircraft of our partners.\"\n\nBut then,  9 hits is already closer to 3% failure to intercept (unless they didn't even try because they knew it would miss?).  \n\nOf course their performance was still very impressive, but \"99% of 300\" seems like propaganda rather than a credible figure.

Putin seems to have done quite a good job from his perspective of motivating support for and tamping down opposition to the war; far better than I would have supposed given the massive cost to Russia in blood, treasure and reputation for a war of choice.  I think the West underestimates this factor to its peril.  This is not to say that everyone in Russia wholeheartedly supports the war.  Undoubtedly there is opposition and probably a far larger segment of the population that is apathetic.  But still, there is a large segment of the population that is genuinely supportive such that service in the Russian military is probably seen as honorable and respected, rather than morally reprehensible or foolish.  I'm not sure how Ukraine or the West can best change such attitudes, but it feels like this could be as or more important than much of the low level WW1 fighting for the next tree line currently taking place.",

Though they also note that other (unnamed \u201cwestern\u201d) sources say 60 a year. \n\nThe Ukrainians claim it\u2019s [15 a month, meaning 180 a year](https://mil.in.ua/en/news/the-defence-intelligence-of-ukraine-revealed-the-pace-of-modernization-and-production-of-russian-t-62-and-t-90-tanks/). But that\u2019s including upgrades/refurbishment.\n\nRight now, it\u2019s at least safe to say that Russian production/refurbishment of T-90Ms is enough to replenish their *T-90M losses* **at its current low rate**.

That's how it is in the Ukraine war and Russia has launched probably in excess of 2000 Iksanders this war (caveat: they accompany small numbers of BMs with large numbers of CMs).

Tehran gave US troops 10 hours of advance warning before raining down massive ballistic missiles on US military positions in Iraq, including al-Asad airbase.\n\nHere's a CNN article from just two months ago, which portrays the 2020 attack quite differently:\n\n>  While no US troops were killed, more than 100 were diagnosed with mild traumatic brain injuries.

They have something to show their domestic audience, inevitably with their own spin on it to make it sound like an effective response.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\nIt's very similar to the response to the hit on their general, where they informed the US of what they were doing so the base could be evacuated (?), before striking.
