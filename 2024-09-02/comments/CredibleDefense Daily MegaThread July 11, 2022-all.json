                    "body": ">The wars deleterious effects on the global economy are definitely more costly than providing military training.\n\nThis is... an open question. Economic impacts are never homogeneously distributed, and it looks like the global south is going to be paying disproportionately in terms of rising food prices and energy vs the West (as per usual). Global negative economic impacts tend to be further distributed such that they shift blame away from domestic politicians (this does not always hold true but it does here).\n\nWhat I mean by this is that it's an incredibly difficult political position to take to say \"let's majorly increase US government spending on Ukraine, who is already receiving billions in aid, such that we can lower inflation which was already on a runaway before the war but nevermind it's Putin's fault, and trust me if you pay more taxes, this war can be won.\" Politics and economics share costs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>There's little reason to think providing military training would be \"too expensive.\"\n\nInteresting, what's your cost estimate of how much, in USD, do you anticipate sufficient training would require? How does this compare to the current expenditures by the West on the war so far? What level of expenditure do you think we can achieve a \"victory\" at and what does that victory look like?\n\nThat really is a critical question - what are the West's aims in this conflict, and how can we achieve them *at minimum* cost.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Russia eventually being successful in its invasion in the face of Western support to Ukraine wouldn't just be embarrassing, it would further tarnish the reputation and intests of the West.\n\nAgain, this is completely unclear. Russia obtaining a pyrrhic victory at great cost while remaining extremely isolated both economically and diplomatically, all just to obtain a portion of Ukraine somehow tarnishes the reputation of the West? This also is highly contingent on the type of outcome we're expecting. Sure, I agree that if tomorrow Russian tanks roll into Kyiv it'll look *pretty bad* but that outcome is highly unlikely.\n\nTo your point, I would argue that Russia being \"successful\" is already off the table given the massive downscaling of Russian war aims since Feb 24 until this point. Another point to add to this is that the West's reputation is not tarnished because we have failed to support democracies against autocratic regimes, but rather because of a series of misadventures and missteps that we have so far been able to avoid.\n\n>I fail to see why training tens of thousands of troops would be a major escalation\n\nSure, allow me to elaborate then. Building out a program such as the one you're envisioning (the transport, training, and equipment of tens of thousands of Ukrainian troops outside the borders of Ukraine) takes *time* which puts Russian military planners on a countdown. Adversaries facing countdowns where war aims will be unachievable by the end rarely (much to our surprise) decide to call off the whole enterprise altogether (see: Japan in 1940, Imperial Germany in 1917 for textbook examples). Instead they typically escalate (Pearl Harbour, 1918 Spring Offensive) because if you know that *long run* the war is lost, then you may as well go for broke and aim for victory *before you get to the long-run.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Seems to me that providing Ukraine with intelligence on Russian targets AND providing them with weapons to attack said targets is far more escalatory.\n\nThe lack of escalatory response or spillover due to previous actions in no way predicts a continuation of the same behaviour. It's called an escalatory *ladder* not merely because it's climbed, but because as we reach new rungs on the ladder we close off previous options available and expand into new ones (a better conceptual model is perhaps an escalatory \"elevator\" that is much more difficult to descend than to climb, with a variety of \"options\" available on each floor we stop at).\n\nHence you may have taken extremely escalatory steps in the past, but that makes *further* steps more dangerous as you remove options from previous levels (for example, an outbreak of conflict typically removes diplomatic resolutions of a dispute by its very nature).\n\nAnyway, to answer your question, I would suggest you get back to me on those cost estimates and show me what percent increase you would anticipate from the existing level of aid so we can get a rough cut of just how much that would be in terms of escalation. Perhaps I'm wrong and training an army is much cheaper than shipping ammo but we'll see (note: cost isn't a perfect proxy for escalation here obviously, in fact it's not a very good one at all, but my point here is that there is a *key* difference between providing equipment and intelligence and saying \"we will now train and support your entire army\").",
                    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>The wars deleterious effects on the global economy are definitely more costly than providing military training.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is... an open question. Economic impacts are never homogeneously distributed, and it looks like the global south is going to be paying disproportionately in terms of rising food prices and energy vs the West (as per usual). Global negative economic impacts tend to be further distributed such that they shift blame away from domestic politicians (this does not always hold true but it does here).</p>\n\n<p>What I mean by this is that it&#39;s an incredibly difficult political position to take to say &quot;let&#39;s majorly increase US government spending on Ukraine, who is already receiving billions in aid, such that we can lower inflation which was already on a runaway before the war but nevermind it&#39;s Putin&#39;s fault, and trust me if you pay more taxes, this war can be won.&quot; Politics and economics share costs.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>There&#39;s little reason to think providing military training would be &quot;too expensive.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Interesting, what&#39;s your cost estimate of how much, in USD, do you anticipate sufficient training would require? How does this compare to the current expenditures by the West on the war so far? What level of expenditure do you think we can achieve a &quot;victory&quot; at and what does that victory look like?</p>\n\n<p>That really is a critical question - what are the West&#39;s aims in this conflict, and how can we achieve them <em>at minimum</em> cost.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Russia eventually being successful in its invasion in the face of Western support to Ukraine wouldn&#39;t just be embarrassing, it would further tarnish the reputation and intests of the West.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Again, this is completely unclear. Russia obtaining a pyrrhic victory at great cost while remaining extremely isolated both economically and diplomatically, all just to obtain a portion of Ukraine somehow tarnishes the reputation of the West? This also is highly contingent on the type of outcome we&#39;re expecting. Sure, I agree that if tomorrow Russian tanks roll into Kyiv it&#39;ll look <em>pretty bad</em> but that outcome is highly unlikely.</p>\n\n<p>To your point, I would argue that Russia being &quot;successful&quot; is already off the table given the massive downscaling of Russian war aims since Feb 24 until this point. Another point to add to this is that the West&#39;s reputation is not tarnished because we have failed to support democracies against autocratic regimes, but rather because of a series of misadventures and missteps that we have so far been able to avoid.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I fail to see why training tens of thousands of troops would be a major escalation</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sure, allow me to elaborate then.

Additional steps of support for Ukraine, are, by their very definition, escalatory. Training tens of thousands of troops to enable Ukraine to engage in major counter-offensives (the stated objective of your OP) is something that takes time. Thus it puts Russia on the clock to achieve war aims prior to that time running down. Adversaries who face time pressures have a tendency to escalate rather than de-escalate (history often plays this out). Hence your plan runs a significant escalation risk. \n\nAnd you *still* haven't got me those cost estimates.",

Some rules-based international world order that, frankly, has done little to benefit them? </p>\n\n<p>Sure, countries may <em>blame</em> Russia for the war (and obviously rightly so), but if you&#39;re asking them to sign on to a sanctions program and pay an substantial burden for a potentially long and drawn out conflict, you&#39;re going to need a pretty substantial justification. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I have an IR background and have worked abroad. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And yet here I am teaching you how escalation ladders work. Where did you work abroad? </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Countries tend to align with states that they think would benefit them</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I thought you said developing countries care about &quot;strengths&quot; and &quot;weaknesses?&quot; </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>so in a conflict between the West and China/proponents of a multipolar world like Russia, do you think countries are going to align with the &quot;decadent and weakening&quot; West, or up and coming China?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That&#39;s a fascinating question, one that your IR experience should have taught you (notably I can think of no IR theorist that speaks of &quot;decadence&quot; as a major variable in geopolitics, but perhaps you can enlighten me). </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I said no such thing. But its just another step to help Ukraine win the war, you&#39;re the one who tried to argue that Russia would assume that it lose the war if the West trained some more Ukrainian troops and that would lead to escalation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My point is actually fairly straightforward. Additional steps of support for Ukraine, are, by their very definition, escalatory. Training tens of thousands of troops to enable Ukraine to engage in major counter-offensives (the stated objective of your OP) is something that takes time. Thus it puts Russia on the clock to achieve war aims prior to that time running down. Adversaries who face time pressures have a tendency to escalate rather than de-escalate (history often plays this out). Hence your plan runs a significant escalation risk. </p>\n\n<p>And you <em>still</em> haven&#39;t got me those cost estimates.</p>\n</div>",

Not that bombing it will necessarily disrupt water supplies to the south (it might, I have no idea, I'm not a civil engineer), but it speaks to the strategic importance. The canal accounted for 85% of Crimean water supplies before the Ukrainians cut it off in 2014 in response to the Russian invasion. Crimean agriculture then immediately contracted by truly crushing amounts. At a minimum in terms of land under cultivation by something like 90%, although the Russians claim economically that the region is doing well because of investments in mechanization and some other hand wavey bullshit. Satellite imagery and reports of water shortages in residential settings seem to indicate a major drought either way. \n\nSo it appears that it is impossible to hold Crimea as an economically productive region without also holding the canal, and it's impossible to hold the canal without holding the land bridge. Interestingly much of the land bridge itself is also irrigated from the canal. Bottom line, if the Ukrainians can just manage to take back this one town, Nova Kakhovka, they can deny the Russians one of their most important strategic goals while simultaneously cutting off water supplies to the now conquered sections of Kherson Oblast, further denying the Russians the economic value of the agriculture there. That's a powerful bargaining chip during any future negotiations.\n\nThe position marked on FIRMS is also directly adjacent to the Kakhovka hydroelectric plant, which in addition to being an important power generator for the region also provides one of the only three bridges across the Dnieper downriver from Zaporizhia. The same three that are currently under Russian control. The other two are just upriver from Kherson City. One is a railroad bridge and the other a highway. There are no crossings downriver from there at all. The next nearest crossing upriver from the dam is over 100 miles away as the crow flies, although it's probably a much greater distance either over the ground or following the river's course. That bridge is currently held on both sides by the Ukrainians, and is well behind their lines of contact on either bank of the Dnieper. \n\nSo for most of northern Kherson Oblast, it's this dam and this dam alone that allows the Russians to stay in the fight. But the Ukrainians really, *really* can't risk destroying (or possibly even damaging) it. They absolutely cannot afford the massive ecological and economic damage that would immediately result from the flooding, loss of power generating capacity, and disruption to shipping. The power plant is especially valuable now that the Russians are disconnecting Zaporizhia NPP from the Ukrainian grid, which even if unsuccessful ultimately will take time to undo. So the Ukrainians likely have refrained and likely will continue to refrain from using less accurate or reliable weapons when targeting Russian positions in the vicinity of the dam. As a result, I suspect that the Russians have more or less been able to treat the area around the dam as if it were protected by a force field for the duration of the war to date.  \n\nUnfortunately for them, the Ukrainians apparently can now afford to strike near to the dam, presumably with HIMARS or other similar quality PGMs formerly held in reserve. Without supplies coming in over the dam, the Russians would be limited to the max throughput for the two remaining bridges under their control, and Russian trucks supplying units in northern Kherson Oblast would have to drive something like thirty miles extra each way to resupply at railheads in or near Kherson City.\n\nCutting off the Russian ground lines of communication over the Karkhovka Dam would all but hand the Ukrainians northern Kherson Oblast, which in turn would simplify retaking the city itself.

Not that bombing it will necessarily disrupt water supplies to the south (it might, I have no idea, I&#39;m not a civil engineer), but it speaks to the strategic importance. The canal accounted for 85% of Crimean water supplies before the Ukrainians cut it off in 2014 in response to the Russian invasion. Crimean agriculture then immediately contracted by truly crushing amounts. At a minimum in terms of land under cultivation by something like 90%, although the Russians claim economically that the region is doing well because of investments in mechanization and some other hand wavey bullshit. Satellite imagery and reports of water shortages in residential settings seem to indicate a major drought either way. </p>\n\n<p>So it appears that it is impossible to hold Crimea as an economically productive region without also holding the canal, and it&#39;s impossible to hold the canal without holding the land bridge. Interestingly much of the land bridge itself is also irrigated from the canal. Bottom line, if the Ukrainians can just manage to take back this one town, Nova Kakhovka, they can deny the Russians one of their most important strategic goals while simultaneously cutting off water supplies to the now conquered sections of Kherson Oblast, further denying the Russians the economic value of the agriculture there. That&#39;s a powerful bargaining chip during any future negotiations.</p>\n\n<p>The position marked on FIRMS is also directly adjacent to the Kakhovka hydroelectric plant, which in addition to being an important power generator for the region also provides one of the only three bridges across the Dnieper downriver from Zaporizhia. The same three that are currently under Russian control. The other two are just upriver from Kherson City. One is a railroad bridge and the other a highway. There are no crossings downriver from there at all. The next nearest crossing upriver from the dam is over 100 miles away as the crow flies, although it&#39;s probably a much greater distance either over the ground or following the river&#39;s course. That bridge is currently held on both sides by the Ukrainians, and is well behind their lines of contact on either bank of the Dnieper. </p>\n\n<p>So for most of northern Kherson Oblast, it&#39;s this dam and this dam alone that allows the Russians to stay in the fight. But the Ukrainians really, <em>really</em> can&#39;t risk destroying (or possibly even damaging) it. They absolutely cannot afford the massive ecological and economic damage that would immediately result from the flooding, loss of power generating capacity, and disruption to shipping. The power plant is especially valuable now that the Russians are disconnecting Zaporizhia NPP from the Ukrainian grid, which even if unsuccessful ultimately will take time to undo. So the Ukrainians likely have refrained and likely will continue to refrain from using less accurate or reliable weapons when targeting Russian positions in the vicinity of the dam. As a result, I suspect that the Russians have more or less been able to treat the area around the dam as if it were protected by a force field for the duration of the war to date.  </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately for them, the Ukrainians apparently can now afford to strike near to the dam, presumably with HIMARS or other similar quality PGMs formerly held in reserve. Without supplies coming in over the dam, the Russians would be limited to the max throughput for the two remaining bridges under their control, and Russian trucks supplying units in northern Kherson Oblast would have to drive something like thirty miles extra each way to resupply at railheads in or near Kherson City.</p>\n\n<p>Cutting off the Russian ground lines of communication over the Karkhovka Dam would all but hand the Ukrainians northern Kherson Oblast, which in turn would simplify retaking the city itself. Taking Nova Kakhovka would also deny Russia a crucial strategic objective by seizing control of the North Crimean Canal at its source.</p>\n\n<p>tl;dr this little red blip on the map is very important</p>\n</div>",

We'd be trying to prove a negative because OSINT reporting, which mostly means UA press releases, isn't giving us the obvious answer.\n\nWe know they had Vilkha-M in large enough numbers to start exporting them. We know those are extremely useful for long range precision strikes. And we know theywere doing precision strikes since early in the war. For instance, the Ukrainians were doing a large scale IO campaign to celebrate certain HVT strikes like Russian command posts the same way earlier IO campaigns focused on TB2 footage. \n\nBut lack of footage or lack of mentioning in press releases about specific weapons doesn't mean they're not being used, which has been an ongoing issue with Javelins, Switchblades, and even UAF tanks, which are rarely seen or mentioned, leaving many to question if they're even used. \n\nAn example is the first two months. Everything was about light infantry with mobile AT weapons but it turns out that was the peripheral when the UAF general staff had to make it a point to announce that artillery beat the Russian Kyiv thrust. Perception isn't reality, just because we weren't seeing artillery fired everywhere, or UAF combined arms mech infantry and tanks fighting, doesn't mean it wasn't happening.\n\nWhy are we seeing so much in the news about HIMARS right now? It's not just because they're so useful, they only had 4x for a few weeks and another 4x for another few weeks. It's because their employment is done in conjunction with a massive IO campaign to promote them. Because the more the Ukrainians can show their usefulness, the more they get. \"Look what we can do with only 8x, imagine what we could do with a hundred!\" I'm not saying they're not being used or not useful or not increasing the release of existing stockpiles that don't need to be rationed, but we need to remember that an IO campaign is just propaganda, which is designed to manipulate.\n\nIf the Vilkha-M was a great success but the UA govt wanted more GMLRS capabilities, specifically HIMARS and preferably ATACMS (Zelensky has been begging for them since early May), would it increase their chances of getting the Biden administration to give them up if the UA were also hyping up the capabilities and effectiveness of their domestic GMLRS? Or would it be better if they did their best to not even mention them because they need to seem desperately in need of a \"new\" capability that turns out they have but are keeping on the qt? \n\nPut it this way: If the panhandler on the street asking you for money is flashing a fat wad of cash while propositioning you, are you likely to give him your money? If the beggar looks well fed, well dressed, well groomed, are you likely to give him your money? Hell no.

I think Russia has somewhere around 500-2000 deployable nuclear weapons. Most in the 100-500kt range. I'd expect something like 25-50% of them to be lost to either failure or interception. At the high end of that range, 1500, that's enough nuclear weapons to destroy Western Europe OR the USA. Not both. Just looking at the USA, the top 20 urban areas are each greater than 2000 km^2. And a 500kt nuke has a 5psi blast radius area of 100 km^2. So that's 20 nukes for 20 areas, or 400 nukes. Just for the top 20. Notable cities outside of the top 20 are Portland, San Jose, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Denver, Indianapolis, etc. It's a similar story in Europe. Europe's population is more densely packed, but the nukes would run into the same problem. There are just too much area to the cities. \n\nAlso, I suspect that Europe will be mostly overlooked for targets in the USA as the USA has more nukes. But who knows. \n\nHonestly, I think Russia would exhaust all their nukes before they even got to all the cities with 1 million+ population. For the cities smaller than that, most will probably be overlooked. \n\n> New York is absolutely, positively fucked if there's a full-scale strategic nuclear conflict.\n\nYeah, I can agree with that. It would be a ruin after the war. Much like Mariupol, or worse. At least the radiation would die down after a few weeks.  \n\nThat said, a bigger impact could be if a EMP weapon is successful deployed to destroy large swaths of electronics, we'd be in deep trouble. But everything I've read about EMPs from nuclear weapons is that they are mostly effective in their blast radius. Even at high altitude, their impact is only against transformers at the end of long power lines. Although that would be catastrophic, there are still many ways to produce power and society will go on.",

I wouldn't be surprised if originally the plan was to attack in January. But that timing was canned because Mr. Xi didn't want anything to ruin his Olympics. So the attack happened at the end of February during the rasputitsa. This meant that the Russians **had to use highways**.

I don't think retaining Sloviansk, Kramatorsk or even Dnipro city will change that much about it.\n\nWhat will be actually decisive is whether Ukraine will be able to retain its sovereignty, even if with significantly reduced area (even when we count just west of Dnipro it's a big country, though). If Ukraine remains sovereign, it will be helped by US/EU a lot (sort of Marshall plan). If it becomes a Russian puppet, there won't be a lot of money coming from the West.

If you were required to go on the record with a statement about your response to a hypothetical event, then the other side would have a much clearer picture of what they could safely do, and reach for maximalist goals much more easily. Strategic ambiguity makes it more dangerous for them to do this.\n\nFor example, Russia could have conquered Georgia. They clearly had the military capability. Why didn't they? Likely because of uncertainty regarding international reaction. That's a victory for strategic ambiguity.\n\nSimilarly, Russia likely could have invaded Crimea and the Donbas in 2014, instead constructed a veneer of deniability, and likely they were less efficient and more cautious as a result, again because of concerns regarding international reaction.\n\nIn this invasion, Russia is pursuing maximalist goals and has dispensed with all the pretenses. Is it all because of Biden's statement? I doubt it. When I think the reasons why they are doing this I'm guessing the most significant reasons are (1) the more conservative nibbles weren't having the desired results in terms of fracturing neighboring countries, (2) Russia was emboldened by the lack of response to past actions, and (3) Russia figured that America and the West generally was exhausted by Afghanistan and distracted by covid and infighting. But removing the strategic ambiguity certainly didn't help.\n\nAlso, strategic ambiguity doesn't commit you to anything. It doesn't look weaker than saying you won't respond to something. (Which arguably is a weaker move than just refusing to say how you'll react.) The ideal way to use clarity and ambiguity would be to make clear statements and follow through with them when you're willing to back them up, and then be ambiguous when you aren't willing to back a statement up. That doesn't reduce your credibility when you are making clear statements at all.\n\nThe way that you give the credibility some teeth is by reacting some of the time. Nobody expects strategic ambiguity to mean that you'll react 100% of the time, and obviously 0% of the time makes it toothless, but reacting occasionally and in a way that minimizes the costs to you and maximizes the costs to your opponent makes it dangerous to cross you, which means your enemies will be more cautious.\n\nOf course, the alternative is to just say that you won't react, and then react anyway if it becomes advantageous later. But that erodes your credibility in a way that strategic ambiguity doesn't.",
