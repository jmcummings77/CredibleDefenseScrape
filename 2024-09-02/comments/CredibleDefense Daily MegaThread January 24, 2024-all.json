        "body": "Yesterday I [posted that Taiwan has started construction of a new domestically built ASW Frigate](https://old.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/19dnw16/credibledefense_daily_megathread_january_23_2024/kj7e5ij/?context=3) and plans to build up that industry.\n\nTurkey is beginning to see a similar plan come to fruition.  They've built their local industry and intend to start exporting products globally. The bottom article is a piece about their latest frigate but also goes into detail about many of Turkey's recently acquired assets.  Below are some key details but I recommend the whole article.\n\n[ASFAT, which is the Turkish acronym for Military Factory and Shipyard Management. ASFAT operates in 9 naval shipyards throughout Turkey; 6 of which are dedicated to maintenance, repair and overhaul; and 3 for shipbuilding, from steel cutting to final fitting and integration. | Breaking Defense | December 2023](https://breakingdefense.com/2023/12/turkish-shipbuilder-asfat-aims-to-expand-its-military-maritime-global-reach/)\n\n*Naturally the ASFAT\u2019s largest customer is the Turkish military, but it\u2019s also currently working through major deals for ships with Pakistan. The company said it\u2019s signed $3.2 billion in contracts altogether, some of them are completed and others are in the works.*\n\n*Company officials said it is also negotiating with Romania for potential deals, and is trying to make inroads in the Gulf. Akgun told Breaking Defense that also Middle East countries including Qatar and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are on the company\u2019s radar, and talks are ongoing, though he didn\u2019t specify what platforms are being discussed.*\n\n[Turkey\u2019s First Domestically-Produced Frigate Has Entered Service | The Warzone | January 2024](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/turkeys-first-domestically-produced-frigate-has-entered-service)\n\n*On January 19, Turkey's first-in-class frigate TCG Istanbul entered into service with the country's Navy during a ceremony held at Sefine Shipyard in Yalova Province, northwest Turkey.*\n\n*The Istanbul class is designed to perform a wide range of missions for the Turkish Navy, including everything from surveillance to anti-surface, anti-air, and anti-submarine warfare.*\n\n*In essence, Istanbul class frigates constitute an enlarged variant of the Ada class anti-submarine corvette, constructed during the first phase of the MILGEM program. Compared to the Ada class frigates' 2,400 ton displacement, the TCG Istanbul has a displacement of 3,100 tons.*\n\n*What's most notable about TCG Istanbul in particular is its high percentage of indigenously built components, particularly in terms of its armament and electronic warfare and sensor suites. In all, some 220 Turkish companies participated in constructing the frigate, which included 80 subcontractors working on the delivery of more than 150 systems, Naval News reports.*\n\n*TCG Istanbul was built at the Istanbul Naval Shipyard by the Turkish defense company Savunma Teknolojileri M\u00fchendislik ve Ticaret A.\u015e. (known as STM), under the direction of the country's Defence Industry Agency (SSB). A contract for its construction was signed in April 2019, and the vessel was later launched in January 2021. All Istanbul class vessels are the product of Turkey's MILGEM national warship program; created in order to acquire indigenously designed, built, and equipped vessels from corvettes to destroyers.*\n\n*A further seven sister frigates within the Istanbul class are to be delivered to the Turkish Navy. The second, third, and fourth vessels \u2014 named TCG \u0130zmir, \u0130\u00e7el, and \u0130zmit \u2014 are currently in various phases of construction at the Anadolu Shipyard in Istanbul, the Sedef Shipyard in Istanbul, and the Sefine Shipyard, respectively. Those shipyards collectively form the TAIS shipyard consortium.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Yesterday I <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/19dnw16/credibledefense_daily_megathread_january_23_2024/kj7e5ij/?context=3\">posted that Taiwan has started construction of a new domestically built ASW Frigate</a> and plans to build up that industry.</p>\n\n<p>Turkey is beginning to see a similar plan come to fruition.  They&#39;ve built their local industry and intend to start exporting products globally. The bottom article is a piece about their latest frigate but also goes into detail about many of Turkey&#39;s recently acquired assets.  Below are some key details but I recommend the whole article.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2023/12/turkish-shipbuilder-asfat-aims-to-expand-its-military-maritime-global-reach/\">ASFAT, which is the Turkish acronym for Military Factory and Shipyard Management. ASFAT operates in 9 naval shipyards throughout Turkey; 6 of which are dedicated to maintenance, repair and overhaul; and 3 for shipbuilding, from steel cutting to final fitting and integration. | Breaking Defense | December 2023</a></p>\n\n<p><em>Naturally the ASFAT\u2019s largest customer is the Turkish military, but it\u2019s also currently working through major deals for ships with Pakistan. The company said it\u2019s signed $3.2 billion in contracts altogether, some of them are completed and others are in the works.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Company officials said it is also negotiating with Romania for potential deals, and is trying to make inroads in the Gulf. Akgun told Breaking Defense that also Middle East countries including Qatar and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are on the company\u2019s radar, and talks are ongoing, though he didn\u2019t specify what platforms are being discussed.</em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/turkeys-first-domestically-produced-frigate-has-entered-service\">Turkey\u2019s First Domestically-Produced Frigate Has Entered Service | The Warzone | January 2024</a></p>\n\n<p><em>On January 19, Turkey&#39;s first-in-class frigate TCG Istanbul entered into service with the country&#39;s Navy during a ceremony held at Sefine Shipyard in Yalova Province, northwest Turkey.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The Istanbul class is designed to perform a wide range of missions for the Turkish Navy, including everything from surveillance to anti-surface, anti-air, and anti-submarine warfare.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>In essence, Istanbul class frigates constitute an enlarged variant of the Ada class anti-submarine corvette, constructed during the first phase of the MILGEM program. Compared to the Ada class frigates&#39; 2,400 ton displacement, the TCG Istanbul has a displacement of 3,100 tons.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>What&#39;s most notable about TCG Istanbul in particular is its high percentage of indigenously built components, particularly in terms of its armament and electronic warfare and sensor suites. In all, some 220 Turkish companies participated in constructing the frigate, which included 80 subcontractors working on the delivery of more than 150 systems, Naval News reports.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>TCG Istanbul was built at the Istanbul Naval Shipyard by the Turkish defense company Savunma Teknolojileri M\u00fchendislik ve Ticaret A.\u015e. (known as STM), under the direction of the country&#39;s Defence Industry Agency (SSB). A contract for its construction was signed in April 2019, and the vessel was later launched in January 2021. All Istanbul class vessels are the product of Turkey&#39;s MILGEM national warship program; created in order to acquire indigenously designed, built, and equipped vessels from corvettes to destroyers.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>A further seven sister frigates within the Istanbul class are to be delivered to the Turkish Navy. The second, third, and fourth vessels \u2014 named TCG \u0130zmir, \u0130\u00e7el, and \u0130zmit \u2014 are currently in various phases of construction at the Anadolu Shipyard in Istanbul, the Sedef Shipyard in Istanbul, and the Sefine Shipyard, respectively. Those shipyards collectively form the TAIS shipyard consortium. TAIS and STM were selected to build the three frigates in early 2023.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Construction of the fifth, sixth, and seventh vessels was green-lit during a meeting of the Turkish Defense Industry Executive Committee, with President Erdogan in attendance, in early January this year, bringing the total number of vessels to 8.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>While a timeline for the delivery of the latter frigates remains unclear, TCG \u0130zmir, \u0130\u00e7el, and \u0130zmit are expected to be built and received by the Turkish Navy within 36 months of TAIS&#39;s and STM&#39;s selection for their construction.

Once they are, along with TCG Istanbul, they will replace the service&#39;s four aging German-built Yavuz class frigates; the first of which, TCG Yavuz, began its service with the Turkish navy in July of 1987.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>As well as TCG Istanbul, 3 other naval assets were introduced into service with the Turkish Navy on January 19.

It wasn't to say that therefore nothing could be done, as nothing had been done before, just that the Iraq decision didn't look like the way to do it.

Does the grievous violation of sovereignty by Russia therefore mean other countries are permitted (by international laws and the legal theories behind those laws) to completely disregard Russia's in turn?

My understanding of (theoretical) sovereignty in modern IR is that states can voluntarily forfeit elements of it to other states and bodies such as the UN, and be punished in ways which may otherwise cross it, in the manner collectively agreed upon by a body like the ILC or the UNSC (ie The Rule based International Order). Outside of what has been agreed, it should not be touched. Russia is guilty of a war of aggression, but I'm finding it hard to follow how the US can, by an act of its legislature, therefore declare Russia has lost part of it sovereignty if such as penalty has not already been established prior by that collective body.\n\n>That does not solve the third-party argument which could be compelling but solvable depending on the way the United States frames it especially as described under natural law and the concept of justice.\n\nI suppose it all ties into the above. I'd imagine the seizure could very well be framed in terms of the two reasons, but what would happen if it crosses established international law? I could easily see the US allowing it if that were the case, after all the probable complainant isn't well liked, and it's a nice shot in the arm for Ukraine.

My understanding of (theoretical) sovereignty in modern IR is that states can voluntarily forfeit elements of it to other states and bodies such as the UN, and be punished in ways which may otherwise cross it, in the manner collectively agreed upon by a body like the ILC or the UNSC (ie The Rule based International Order). Outside of what has been agreed, it should not be touched. Russia is guilty of a war of aggression, but I&#39;m finding it hard to follow how the US can, by an act of its legislature, therefore declare Russia has lost part of it sovereignty if such as penalty has not already been established prior by that collective body.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>That does not solve the third-party argument which could be compelling but solvable depending on the way the United States frames it especially as described under natural law and the concept of justice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I suppose it all ties into the above. I&#39;d imagine the seizure could very well be framed in terms of the two reasons, but what would happen if it crosses established international law? I could easily see the US allowing it if that were the case, after all the probable complainant isn&#39;t well liked, and it&#39;s a nice shot in the arm for Ukraine. I just wonder what legal impact it would have in the longer term</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am on the run so I will be brief.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thank you in any case though. The more I read about it the more I agree with you, the migraines that any lawyers and legal theorists touching this case have will not be envied.</p>\n</div>",

The Chinese are much more capable, have about 3x the number of strategic bombers, and about 5x the number of non-nuclear ground-based launchers as Russia. A lot of focus on ASBMs, and rightfully so, but I wonder how a carrier attack like this is modeled. I recall this was the soviet strategy during the cold war, so someone likely has done research on it. If Russia is sending that volume of ordnance with 11 Tu-95s at a time, one wonders what China could do with its arsenal of 231 H-6 bombers. \n\n2. Trading less than a brigade of missiles for a supercarrier seems like... a fantastic trade? China has at least 6 MRBM brigades as of 4 years ago, and that number is sure to increase. \n\n3. \"let alone sink or disable it\" is interesting phrasing. Carriers are hard to sink, but is there a genuine assumption that 3000lb of DF-26 high explosive warhead flying through a carrier deck might not cause a mission kill? \n\n4. Others have pointed out but I think it bears repeating here that China has a very high ballistic missile test launch tempo -- over 100 per year. We don't know their production capability but it's probably healthy. Expending 12 missiles in the context of an arsenal potentionally hundreds of systems deep is a non-issue for the Chinese.",

On the surface of things, yes, it's unproven, but only because if it's ever proven we're in a shooting war with China. \n\nThe US and other regional partners frequently conduct freedom of navigation exercises, to allow China to exert this essentially massive area of denial during peace time just makes no sense. Operations during peace time, especially freedom of navigation which requires close proximity are not often curtailed even when the adversary has significant anti ship capabilities. This part to me needed an asterisk or didn't really need mentioned at all. Peace time is not war time and discussing peace time operations in any context alongside the capabilities of China's rocket force holds very little value to me. \n\nAside from that the rest of it is quite informative, the only other point I would note is that US missile stocks are in a worse place and several war games in the last couple of years have pointed out that inventories will not be sufficient to blunt and completely deter a potential move against Taiwan until well into the 2030s (which I guess is fine, assuming China continues it's naval ramp up and \"out build them\" approach but again that equation might be substantially different if China invests further in its strike and naval capabilities).\n\nThere's not really much to learn if you're already versed on this topic but I'd strongly advise anyone interested give it a read, it's a solid starting point for understanding the strategic forces at play in the Pacific and this is certainly one of the more informative pieces I've seen recently on the rocketry capabilities of other regional players, there's a tendency to focus on China but ultimately a conflict, should one arise, will not happen in a vacuum. \n\nAnother point that I think is worth mentioning is that it's curious that this doesn't mention US efforts in regards to Tinian. Perhaps they just didn't realize this was going on, or maybe the document was drafted long ago and this relatively new information didn't make the cut?   \n  \nEssentially Guam is under China's \"denial umbrella\" which given its prominence for US strategic forces could become a serious issue. The US isn't asleep at the wheel on this one, thankfully, Tinian which has long been abandoned is in the process of being cleared (there are decades of brush growth and disrepair to sort out) and readied for active service again. They're still clearing the overgrowth from what I understand and then plan to overhaul that entire end of the island, so we'll see if they extend the runways to provide redundancy for more regional based US strategic forces. \n\nThe Tinian move to me is quite major as it shows that the US is aware that it's positioning in Guam is vulnerable, which again lends credence to the strike capabilities of China's rocketry forces, it was certainly worthy of note as it would nudge them away from discussing carrier strikes and more to discussing aerial denial (in the terms of traditional ground based airfields) which is going to play an arguably larger role in the opening of the conflict. The last few war games I read devoted significant resources to discussing and gaming out LSRASM as a strategically significant counter weight in the early days of a conflict against China, US strategic forces will be key to delivering these missiles and should China greatly degrade American capabilities (even just delaying the American response) it could prove disastrous for Taiwan.",

Shoigu has just been informed an IL-76 with valuable cargo that isn't Ukrainian PoWs has been shot down near Belgorod. Putin instructs him to do anything that could avoid a PR disaster, and if possible frame Ukraine instead. He recalls there was a planned prisoner exchange today (this was confirmed by the Ukrainian side), so he proposes claiming it was carrying PoW instead. He instructs an underling to send RT a fictional list of PoW who were in that plane.\n\nNow, we know the names were picked from a real list of Ukrainian PoW held by Russia, rather than being invented by AI or something else, because [Ukrainian media confirmed the names match those of known PoW](https://kyivindependent.com/suspilne-confirms-identities-of-ukrainian-pows-on-list-published-by-russian-propaganda/). So one obvious source of error would be picking a list of PoW who'd already been released in a previous exchange (in which case *all* the names would've been incorrect, not just 1). Another possibility is it was arbitrarily decided the number of claimed PoW deaths must be 65, and so they had to mix and match from several lists to craft a fictional group of 65 PoW. But in this case too, how would they end up with exactly *one* error in the whole dataset? If they'd stupidly merged names from the previous exchange's list with those of today's exchange, we would've seen more erroneous names - maybe 17, as was initially claimed. But I see no clear rationale why Konovalenko's name would somehow creep in.\n\n> Can you show examples?\n\nOn January 8th, one of the largest Russian telegram channels (https://t. me/boris_rozhin/108913) wrote that only 173 Ukrainian PoW had actually been exchanged, instead of the 230 figure that had initially been quoted in Ukrainian media (the article in OP has 230 names).\n\nIt's actually a much larger discrepancy than what I'd remembered, and would be a plausible reason why Konovalenko showed up twice. Moreover, I don't see why the blogger would have lied here, as I doubt anyone was seeing this event coming.\n\nI also recall Russian channels complaining about not getting PoW the exact amount of PoW they'd been promised, or not the right people, but I haven't been able to find the posts yet.\n\n> Doesn't really work in the contrapositive, here's why:\n\n> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Russian_generals_killed_during_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine\n\n> A lot of the generals Ukraine claimed were killed but Russia didn't admit were killed didn't actually show up on screen for months afterwards, and apparently at least one still hasn't.\n\n> And those are generals, this is just some guy.\n\nThere are rational reasons for Russia to do this in those circumstances. Reacting in a differentiated manner when the claim is false (i.e. providing evidence that a supposedly dead general is actually still alive) implies admission of its truthfulness when no rebuttal is made. For instance, if Russia were to systematically show a general's face right after he was claimed to be dead, then suddenly refuse to do it, we could reasonably infer he really is dead this time.\n\nThis would mean leaking information, by giving Ukraine the opportunity to confirm or infirm its assessments following, say, a missile strike, and losing plausible deniability in the PR game. The only cost was looking dumb in the early months of the war, as the claims of killed generals all seemed credible given the lack of rebuttal.\n\nThese dynamics don't apply here, as the question of whether this random soldier is alive or not is of little intrinsic value, we only care about it to the extent that it would have implications for the matter we're really interested in. This exact situation is also very unlikely to occur again.",

The only cost was looking dumb in the early months of the war, as the claims of killed generals all seemed credible given the lack of rebuttal.</p>\n\n<p>These dynamics don&#39;t apply here, as the question of whether this random soldier is alive or not is of little intrinsic value, we only care about it to the extent that it would have implications for the matter we&#39;re really interested in. This exact situation is also very unlikely to occur again.</p>\n</div>",

If AI is just quantitatively more powerful, faster, cheaper, but fundamentally still just an LLM its military impact outside of a few niches will be limited. Meaning all this is just handwringing.</p>\n\n<p>Really where were at is where drone technology was in the 1980s. You read some of the wunderwaffen stuff proposed for AirLand Battle 2000 some of it is CRAZY and super visionary. Also, importantly, not possible with then tech. It took nearly forty years of development across a broad range of technologies to deliver on just a fragment of the promise of that technology. But from 1980-2015 drones remained, mostly, just an ISR platform you could loiter long term and which could also fire missiles if you <em>really</em> wanted to. Niche, not transformative, but with major evolutions under the surface re: weight and data output.</p>\n</div>",
