      "selftext": "The r/CredibleDefense daily megathread is for asking questions and posting submissions that would not fit the criteria of our post submissions. As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster. Don't abuse it though! If something is not obviously against the rules but you still feel that it should be reviewed, leave a short but descriptive comment while filing the report.",

        "body": "Michael Kofman and Rob Lee released another episode of the Russian Contingency. This episode serves to broaden the focus away from the Zaporizhia offensive, focusing on sustainment, other fronts of the war, and some attempts to predict future developments. While I cannot share a publicly accessible version of this podcast, I have summarized some of the key takeaways below:[^^^brought ^^^to ^^^you ^^^by ^^^the ^^^Lemmy](https://sh.itjust.works/post/1520023)\n\nThere is always a focus on large, high-tech items for equipping units of the formal Ukrainian army. But what Ukrainians need are low-tech, basic armored vehicles like the M113 for back-line roles. Similarly, units like the TDF and National Guard are often underequipped despite holding the front line against Russian armor just like regular army units. Quantity is very important for resolving both of these issues.\n\nThere are no wunderwaffen. Conflicts come down to force employment, force qualities, and force enablers--these are the sources of Ukrainian challenges so far.\n\nUkraine has had more success around Bakhmut, despite the presence of higher-quality Russian units there. Kofman mentions in particular the 31st Air Assault Brigade, which has apparently been pulled off the front lines. However, there are a large variety of Russian units in the area.\n\nBakhmut is like a punch bowl surrounded by high ground. Russia continues to hold some of this high ground, but Ukrainian advances have imperiled those. Russian entrenchments here are less elaborate than those in the south. Highly motivated and coordinated veteran units are the backbone of Ukraine's assault here. \n\nRussian military's problems in the area began when they took Bakhmut. Wagner bore the brunt of the fighting to conquer the city, but Bakhmut is exceedingly difficult to defend as well. The reason it took Russia so long to do it was because of its failure to encircle the city with dismounted infantry(Kofman makes a direct comparison here between Russia's struggles in Vuhledar and Bakhmut and Ukraine's struggles in Zaporizhia). Russia is struggling to hold a defensively unfavorable location and losing higher-quality troops in the process.\n\nBakhmut was not a trap for Russian forces. Rather, this counteroffensive is simultaneously a fixing action and a manifestation of political objectives. In the process, however, Ukraine is attriting Russian airborne units, which have been seen as Moscow's strategic reserve in this conflict. Almost all of the naval infantry is on the southern front, and almost all of the airborne infantry/VDV are on the eastern front.\n\nAttrition rate is overall favorable for Ukraine(interesting to compare this to yesterday's episode, where Rob mentioned that Ukraine was likely taking heavier losses than Russia was in the south). However, Russia has a lot of artillery fires, and these fires are being concentrated on Ukrainian advances. The key issue is generating and sustaining momentum while taking attrition. \n\nWagner mutiny further increases political importance of Bakhmut. Wagner and supporters would be empowered by further Ukrainian advances in the area. \n\nUkrainians may need to commit further resources in order to continue advancing. Both sides may end up too attrited to continue further offensive operations in the area.\n\nSteady pace of dismissals of Russian commanders may be relevant as Russia increasingly begins to look towards a rotation. Rotation of units could substantially affect their ability to defend as units are replaced with less experienced, mobilized personnel who may be less familiar with the terrain. In addition, some units from the south will likely have to be diverted to Bakhmut. However, the south will continue to be heavily defended. Ukraine's strategy of advancing on three fronts creates pressure, forces Russia to make choices, and eventually may lead to a breakthrough. Taking Bakhmut itself does not lead to much.\n\nDealing with attrition and recovering force quality are key battlefield enablers. Key aspect of this is making the choice to attrite or preserve units in the first place, as with Ukraines original choice to defend Bakhmut. One argument one could make is that this denied Ukraine the ability to take veterans from those brigades and deploy them in the south. The moment Russia took Bakhmut, however, the balance shifted, and now Bakhmut is an opportunity for Ukraine to inflict attrition on Russian units. Territorial movements may be modest but offensive may succeed in sapping Russian capabilities for offensive action in the future. \n\nIn the South, mix of units, including Storm Z, mobilized, naval infantry, Spesnatz, etc. Attrition to some of these groups is more sustainable than others. Hard to assess who is taking attrition from OSINT. Ukraine has an advantage in tube artillery, Russia has an advantage in rocket artillery. Russian advances may be stymied by lack of artillery overmatch.\n\nUkraine has enough artillery shells for this offensive--but what about after. US and EU have not scaled up ammunition production sufficiently to match Ukraine's monthly use rate. Ukrainian has been supplied from stockpiles, but that is not an infinite resource. Artillery ammunition supplies may be the most important facet of this war for both sides.\n\nRussian fires will also be restricted as their stockpiles run out. Kofman makes a \"wild\" guess at Russia being able to produce about a million artillery shells of their most common caliber per year. This will dramatically constrict their rates of fires. Ukrainian fires cannot come from quantity, they have to make up the difference in quality.\n\nUkrainian infantry are pound-for-pound better than Russian infantry up to the company level. As long as they have the supplies, they will outperform expectations. That hasn't been the case in the past five weeks of the offensive. Russia is fighting more competently than before.\n\nPressure to negotiate comes up against the questions of with who and what. Russia has shown no signs that they are willing to negotiate. Russia is unlikely to give up any of the territory it has formally annexed, and Ukraine has no reason to consider accepting that. A premature peace may just be an interlude until a second war breaks out. Battlefield developments have not led either side to feel like they need to make concessions. This is already a long war, and it's likely to go on, even after the decisive phase of war has passed.\n\nMilitary sustainment and Western will are critical. Ukrainians will take any vehicles at all. Even Toyota Hiluxes will do, but extra protection is in particularly short supply. Much of this is out of Ukraine's control. Every time Ukraine has had to retreat, it has been because of Russian fires dominance. As long Ukraine has supplies of artillery shells, further Russian advances will remain unlikely.\n\nDPICMs have risks, but they are particularly good for disrupting Russian armor concentrations. \n\nBe careful of anecdotal evidence. Mobilization has resulted in a flurry of embarrassing stories for Russia--video appeals, mass shootings, etc. But mobilization also saved Russia's position in this war and allowed them to hold their lines. Without it, they may have lost by now. Hopes that Russian forces would collapse despite all the negative reports. Despite horrific anecdotes about mobilization, minimal domestic pressure to end the war. Domestic upheaval is possible and would have major impacts on the war.\n\nNATO/US must take a longer view of things. War will likely go on for 1 or more years. May be good to pull veterans off the front lines and send them abroad for better training.\n\nShoigu and Gerasimov have not done particularly well and do not command much respect in the Russian military. One of the side effects of the mutiny is that Putin cares more about loyalty than before. Seliverstov was removed despite his competence, possibly because he worked closely with Wagner, and therefore his loyalty was under dispute. Russia has generally moved to more competent commanders through this war, but the coup attempt threatens to reverse that trend. Surovikin is arguably responsible for Russian success--if he had not been in charge, its possible Russia would have fared far worse. Now his position is in jeopardy. Loss of competence in favor of loyalty is a long-term factor for Russia. \n\nThis offensive has not failed. Ukrainian military has a theory of success and will fight it the way they know best from this point forward. It will stretch out through and beyond the summer. To the extent that the West can sustain and provide the support they need, it will have real impacts.\n\nMore episodes coming soon with other members of the team that traveled to Zaporizhia.",

Artillery ammunition supplies may be the most important facet of this war for both sides.</p>\n\n<p>Russian fires will also be restricted as their stockpiles run out. Kofman makes a &quot;wild&quot; guess at Russia being able to produce about a million artillery shells of their most common caliber per year. This will dramatically constrict their rates of fires. Ukrainian fires cannot come from quantity, they have to make up the difference in quality.</p>\n\n<p>Ukrainian infantry are pound-for-pound better than Russian infantry up to the company level. As long as they have the supplies, they will outperform expectations. That hasn&#39;t been the case in the past five weeks of the offensive. Russia is fighting more competently than before.</p>\n\n<p>Pressure to negotiate comes up against the questions of with who and what. Russia has shown no signs that they are willing to negotiate. Russia is unlikely to give up any of the territory it has formally annexed, and Ukraine has no reason to consider accepting that. A premature peace may just be an interlude until a second war breaks out. Battlefield developments have not led either side to feel like they need to make concessions. This is already a long war, and it&#39;s likely to go on, even after the decisive phase of war has passed.</p>\n\n<p>Military sustainment and Western will are critical. Ukrainians will take any vehicles at all. Even Toyota Hiluxes will do, but extra protection is in particularly short supply. Much of this is out of Ukraine&#39;s control. Every time Ukraine has had to retreat, it has been because of Russian fires dominance. As long Ukraine has supplies of artillery shells, further Russian advances will remain unlikely.</p>\n\n<p>DPICMs have risks, but they are particularly good for disrupting Russian armor concentrations. </p>\n\n<p>Be careful of anecdotal evidence. Mobilization has resulted in a flurry of embarrassing stories for Russia--video appeals, mass shootings, etc. But mobilization also saved Russia&#39;s position in this war and allowed them to hold their lines. Without it, they may have lost by now. Hopes that Russian forces would collapse despite all the negative reports. Despite horrific anecdotes about mobilization, minimal domestic pressure to end the war. Domestic upheaval is possible and would have major impacts on the war.</p>\n\n<p>NATO/US must take a longer view of things. War will likely go on for 1 or more years. May be good to pull veterans off the front lines and send them abroad for better training.</p>\n\n<p>Shoigu and Gerasimov have not done particularly well and do not command much respect in the Russian military. One of the side effects of the mutiny is that Putin cares more about loyalty than before. Seliverstov was removed despite his competence, possibly because he worked closely with Wagner, and therefore his loyalty was under dispute. Russia has generally moved to more competent commanders through this war, but the coup attempt threatens to reverse that trend. Surovikin is arguably responsible for Russian success--if he had not been in charge, its possible Russia would have fared far worse. Now his position is in jeopardy. Loss of competence in favor of loyalty is a long-term factor for Russia. </p>\n\n<p>This offensive has not failed. Ukrainian military has a theory of success and will fight it the way they know best from this point forward. It will stretch out through and beyond the summer. To the extent that the West can sustain and provide the support they need, it will have real impacts.</p>\n\n<p>More episodes coming soon with other members of the team that traveled to Zaporizhia.</p>\n</div>",

Time after time in this war that doesn't mean the whole unit is there. Similarly, when smaller units down to the battalion level are spotted somewhere, that doesn't at all mean the larger unit is there too. If a brigade or division are reported to be in a sector, it might very well mean their individual HQs are put in charge of a sector to run it as their tactical commander, using their organic brigade or division level support assets, and probably some organic maneuver units, but also with ones attached from other large units, not just a collection of very different battalions but also collections of very different types of companies in each different battalion sized command. \n\nWhat I'm saying is the Russian force is far more modular than most other militaries have ever attempted, but they're doing it out of necessity. \n\nFor example, the VDV are a shadow of their former selves too due to heavy losses in the last year plus. They likely lost a significant number of their company level forces, especially junior leaders, as well as large numbers of company commanders, battalion commanders, and even some higher. So they'd have been replenished over the last year and a half continuously with new replacements, either volunteer contract'niks who signed up during the early \"Shadow Mobilization\" and the one still ongoing, or Mobiks from their partial mobilization. \n\nNot only are the air assault infantry battalions of the VDV filled with Mobiks (including many officers), they even use Storm-Z companies within them (though its still unknown if they're organic or just attached). \n\nThere is a UAF reserve office on Twitter named Tatarigami\\_UA who has written extensively of the Russian push to create assault/storm detachments and companies within larger formations, especially regiments/brigades. Those are elite units who are especially trained for dismounted offensive operations, but not just assault troops but support, like sappers, snipers, automatic grenadiers/mortarmen, and even dedicated troops whose job is to quickly move up to dig trenches. And sources have pointed that the VDV are building those too. \n\nWhat about everyone else in the unit who aren't in those storm units? They're the dregs who are incapable of high speed low drag missions, especially offensive. \n\nMost likely, the dregs of the VDV are better than the dregs of the average motorize rifle unit. However, there is only a degree of skill and quality they can impose on them as a larger group as the Russians are, by and large, not giving the resources to maintain quality. \n\nWestern infantry aren't like this. While they might have a recon or sniper platoon at the battalion level that are considered the elite, its got a very specific mission and not meant to assault. The other line companies are all equal, all expected to complete basically the same job (though the Marines do play around with task organizing rifle companies differently, with some different training, they're not expected to take significantly more casualties than each other). Not even back in WW2 did Western forces do what the Russians are doing. Sure, there were claims back in WW1 that the British were using some Commonwealth forces as cannon fodder to protect actual British units, unlikely since British units got hammered too. From what I understand, the Ukraininans don't do it either. \n\nBut the Russians are creating different tiers of the same job to perform different missions, and that's pretty crazy (though also a bit smart in a way). And for some of them, the middle and especially lower tier units even in larger more \"elite\" formations like the VDV, are definitely more expendable than others. \n\nSo hopefully a strategy to fight in Bakhmut again doesn't end up with a similar result as last time, when their great attrition strategy ended up largely targeting Russian convicts. \n\nWhat they need to do now, not just in Bakhmut but elsewhere, is figure out how to exploit the weaknesses of those extremely task organized units to focus on killing the ones they mean to preserve. Not an easy task, it'll require some pretty significant planning. But if they can't do that, they rightly might end up on another big campaign that chiefly ends up killing more Russian convicts. \n\nThe UAF should post an open source description of Russian tactical order of battle onto Twitter and then ask posters to suggest ways to destroy the Storm detachments inside while attacking. 99% of submissions would be shit, but I bet they'd get a few worth borrowing and trying out.

But still...\n\nThe average Mobik age is supposedly 35 years old, an old man in the infantry. They'd have limited military service experience beforehand and nothing at all to prepare them for this sort of war. \n\nAnd how much refresher new training did they really get? Shadow mobilization contract'niks who joined before the partial mobilization supposedly got 3 weeks. Early partial mobilization was 1-3 weeks. Later groups supposedly got months, though I'm doubtful of that since it doesn't really fit the modus operandi of the Russians. Documents regarding forming elite storm detachment say training is like 2 weeks long. \n\nAnd that's just training for junior enlisted infantry dismounts. What about vehicle crews, a much more technically challenging job? What about other combat support jobs? \n\nWhat about junior officers? Prewar training for them used to be 4-5 years at academies, what's it at now? Considering the Russian system leaned extensively on junior officers in a way that western militaries don't, they need them to be successful. How could the VDV be a successful organization across the board,  not just with a small elite within the organization, if they can't maintain a successful junior officer corps to run things? \n\nI'm not saying they're trash. And the Russians have clearly worked diligently to protect those units since last fall by only giving them missions that work to their favor while giving the more dangerous missions to more expendable units. But to be high quality requires an investment that I've not really seen. \n\nWhat I think is more likely is that they're high quality for what Russia has left. Though that doesn't say much...\n\nThese conversations are why I wish i could do an interview with Jack Watling and just ask him questions. For all the info about the Russian military that's come out, I've still got a million questions because so much is still unknown.\n\n>I'm curious if Russia will ever start using boys from the military service on the frontlines if things get particularly bad, and even more curious about how much pressure there will be at the end of their service to sign permanent contracts\n\nThey might not need to. Those guys are safe during their year of conscript service, though they might be pressured to sign a contract. But then they're in the general reserve and can be called up in partial mobilization. There's been talk the partial mobilization never stopped, Ukraine intelligence still thinks the Russians are mobilizing 20k/month, not counting the recruitment campaign for more contract'niks.",
                    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>The ISW had reported the presence of mobilized men in VDV but I&#39;m skeptical about them being poor in quality (as claimed), at least compared to the average level of the Army&#39;s mobilized.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I&#39;m in agreement that they likely take the better of the Mobiks, similar to how they historically got the better conscripts and contract&#39;niks. But still...</p>\n\n<p>The average Mobik age is supposedly 35 years old, an old man in the infantry. They&#39;d have limited military service experience beforehand and nothing at all to prepare them for this sort of war. </p>\n\n<p>And how much refresher new training did they really get? Shadow mobilization contract&#39;niks who joined before the partial mobilization supposedly got 3 weeks. Early partial mobilization was 1-3 weeks. Later groups supposedly got months, though I&#39;m doubtful of that since it doesn&#39;t really fit the modus operandi of the Russians. Documents regarding forming elite storm detachment say training is like 2 weeks long. </p>\n\n<p>And that&#39;s just training for junior enlisted infantry dismounts. What about vehicle crews, a much more technically challenging job? What about other combat support jobs? </p>\n\n<p>What about junior officers? Prewar training for them used to be 4-5 years at academies, what&#39;s it at now? Considering the Russian system leaned extensively on junior officers in a way that western militaries don&#39;t, they need them to be successful. How could the VDV be a successful organization across the board,  not just with a small elite within the organization, if they can&#39;t maintain a successful junior officer corps to run things? </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not saying they&#39;re trash. And the Russians have clearly worked diligently to protect those units since last fall by only giving them missions that work to their favor while giving the more dangerous missions to more expendable units. But to be high quality requires an investment that I&#39;ve not really seen. </p>\n\n<p>What I think is more likely is that they&#39;re high quality for what Russia has left. Though that doesn&#39;t say much...</p>\n\n<p>These conversations are why I wish i could do an interview with Jack Watling and just ask him questions.

A factory building is still just an industrial building like a warehouse. As long as there are loading docks, high ceilings, high capacity power and gas infrastructure there, it will work. Adding to that, if manufacturing equipment is shipped in from another site, you can cut down the time instead of waiting for it to be produced. The only thing that can't be cut down is the modification of the interior and training of the people. \n\nTheir plans to start this project is to first train workers in Germany who would then assemble and repair in Ukraine and eventually work up to production. So most likely it would be an existing building that met their general needs. While they renovate it, they would train Ukrainians in Germany and then move those workers and process into Ukraine. \n\nThat will still take at least a year, probably 18 months from when the ink dries unless they already have a perfect place and pool of people. It could also take longer depending on other factors. But it will be quicker than say a peace time private company building a factory. \n\n>Who is gonna man the defenses? How is it gonna defend itself from cruise missiles and potentially hypersonics?\n\nThe obvious answer is it is going to be in/near a city already under the Ukrainian AA umbrella with these added defenses reinforcing it.

It's important to note that SPGs and MLRS comprise the majority of visually confirmed Russian long range fire losses at the moment because Ukraine is specifically hunting for them using drones/precision fires as they're much less likely to get knocked out by counterbattery fire due to the ease with which they can shoot and scoot. \n\nIn other words, it's hard to say what *actual* losses are on either side, but at the very least we can say that based on visually confirmed data Ukrainian losses are at this point less than their Russian counterparts which likely indicates that overall losses on both sides is something close to even despite Ukraine being on the offensive.",

The deployment will bring additional aviation and maritime assets, as well as U.S. Marines to the region.\n\n>The Pentagon didn\u2019t immediately say how many troops would be deployed, but the Navy says such a group typically has assault and landing ships, aircraft and about 5,000 people. \n\n>>The move comes just days after the US announced that it would send a destroyer and fighter aircraft including F-35s to the Persian Gulf in response to Iranian seizures and harassment in and around the Strait of Hormuz.\n\n>The decision to send more military muscle follows tense encounters in the region.

But at this point in the war, Ukraine isn't desperate for manpower in the way it used to be, yet training appears to still be much more barebones than one would expect. We've seen time and again in this war that force quality is essential to launching effective offensive operations, but Ukrainian training programs seem to leave a lot to be desired, even among brand-new, top-tier, Western-equipped units, as [noted in the recent Russian Contingency podcast](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/154oytg/credibledefense_daily_megathread_july_20_2023/jssiuyx?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=2). \n\nSide note, I highly recommend you listen to the podcast, or at the very least read the key takeaways from that podcast if you havent already.

Providing green, poorly trained (by NATO standards) recruits with the best Western kit is proving to be extremely wasteful. My understanding is that the Ukrainian trainees in these programs are only receiving something like 6-8 weeks worth of training, which is much shorter than respective training programs for the armed forces of actual NATO memberstates. \n\nSo what exactly is the issue? Is it a lack of training capacity? Not enough trainers? More of a need for fresh manpower than it outwardly appears? Just curious what everyone thinks.",

            "body": "I wont stake my life on this opinion but its the culmination of watching this war since the start, doing quite a bit of digging on open source, and being someone who has in the past (due to my own military experience) known the incredible value of *high quality* military training (in comparison to low quality, which is often a waste of time).  \n\nThe biggest issue as to why the Ukrainians aren't focusing on it is their need to maintain very high operational tempo (OPTEMPO). \n\nThe Ukrainians (and Russians for that matter) have been going balls to the wall for the whole war, when they're defending a strategic main effort they're typically launching a minimum of one big counterattack or counteroffensive too. That's a choice, no if, and, or buts. Their are pro and cons for making that choice, the con is that they can't take \"luxuries\" like extended training at the individual and definitely not the unit level, let them learn in combat where they can contribute to the larger strategic plan. \n\nIts a very Soviet way of thinking, and not surprising since pretty much every current UAF 3-4 star general started out as in the Soviet Armed Forces, some like Sysky making it to major before the collapse of the USSR. And the 1990s-2000s were bad times for the UAF, who were basically a very badly funded and prepared Soviet military, much smaller in size and struggling to pay their forces, recruit, let alone train. \n\nSince this war has started, the Ukrainians have been taking extremely heavy casualties requiring replacements for those, while also essentially quadrupling in size (or more) since the start too. And while they've recalled basically everyone in the country who had every worn a uniform and could reasonable enter battle (stories about the ages and physical conditions of some of the people entering service is pretty sad and scary), but a a sizeable chunk of those entering, especially since late 2022 to the present, have zero military training. \n\nTo train the replacements for the existing units and the personnel for the new ones requires either 1) Taking a strategic pause where Ukraine only performs economy of force defensive operations, focusing on maneuver defense at the tactical and operational level to preserve their force (which volunteering to lose ground if necessary), in exchange buying the time to train new forces, be they junior enlisted infantry to M777 artillery technicians. Or 2) Making the training as short as absolutely possible, or even forgoing it altogether, as sacrifice needed to complete the mission assigned by strategic leadership (political and top military) to pursue their strategic planning cycles. \n\nUkraine chose Option 2. \n\nAnd it's worked for them so far, up until this point they got away with it. \n\nAnd this war isn't the first they did that, the UAF top brass neglected training while pushing high OPTEMPO throughout the early violent stages of the Donbas War, which was the \"finishing school\" in terms of military life experiences for most senior Ukrainian generals, it was THE defining parts of their military careers before this war started. \n\nThey learned lessons from that war, that were reinforced by their own military culture (with its strong Soviet lean, including lessons from The Great Patriotic War), so many think they learned good lessons that training is overrated. But the way learning lessons works in real life is sometimes lessons learned aren't good, sometimes bad lessons are learned simply because they the person didn't suffer repercussions for bad decisions due to an untold number of reasons. But its a well known problem, and why analyzing performance is such a big part now when it comes to any effective training plan, regardless of the field. \n\nAdditional issues, besides unwillingness to allow troops to \"waste time\" for extended periods training when they can be fighting (which is the attitude that drives such decision making), are some that you mention, namely lack of trainers. \n\nWhat it appears to be is that Ukraine OPTEMPO is too high to spare the troops, so UAF isn't sparing the NCOs and officers especially that are necessary for large scale quality training in their rear areas. When that became a problem, the West pitched in and offered to help. \n\nThey do that with a mix of western ex-military private military contractor companies operating in Ukraine, as well as NATO assistance, doing a mix of necessary technical training on foreign equipment and some types of advanced training (mainly medical), initial/basic training of the sort to produce junior enlisted infantry riflemen (which was only created when it became apparently Ukraine couldn't train enough), and then the US Army's 5 week battalion level combined arms course, which only started in late January and has a limited capacity. \n\nWould it be possible to expand training? Absolutely, every major combatant in WW2 did it, and in subsequent wars. But it will require sacrifices.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I wont stake my life on this opinion but its the culmination of watching this war since the start, doing quite a bit of digging on open source, and being someone who has in the past (due to my own military experience) known the incredible value of <em>high quality</em> military training (in comparison to low quality, which is often a waste of time).  </p>\n\n<p>The biggest issue as to why the Ukrainians aren&#39;t focusing on it is their need to maintain very high operational tempo (OPTEMPO). </p>\n\n<p>The Ukrainians (and Russians for that matter) have been going balls to the wall for the whole war, when they&#39;re defending a strategic main effort they&#39;re typically launching a minimum of one big counterattack or counteroffensive too. That&#39;s a choice, no if, and, or buts. Their are pro and cons for making that choice, the con is that they can&#39;t take &quot;luxuries&quot; like extended training at the individual and definitely not the unit level, let them learn in combat where they can contribute to the larger strategic plan. </p>\n\n<p>Its a very Soviet way of thinking, and not surprising since pretty much every current UAF 3-4 star general started out as in the Soviet Armed Forces, some like Sysky making it to major before the collapse of the USSR. And the 1990s-2000s were bad times for the UAF, who were basically a very badly funded and prepared Soviet military, much smaller in size and struggling to pay their forces, recruit, let alone train. </p>\n\n<p>Since this war has started, the Ukrainians have been taking extremely heavy casualties requiring replacements for those, while also essentially quadrupling in size (or more) since the start too. And while they&#39;ve recalled basically everyone in the country who had every worn a uniform and could reasonable enter battle (stories about the ages and physical conditions of some of the people entering service is pretty sad and scary), but a a sizeable chunk of those entering, especially since late 2022 to the present, have zero military training. </p>\n\n<p>To train the replacements for the existing units and the personnel for the new ones requires either 1) Taking a strategic pause where Ukraine only performs economy of force defensive operations, focusing on maneuver defense at the tactical and operational level to preserve their force (which volunteering to lose ground if necessary), in exchange buying the time to train new forces, be they junior enlisted infantry to M777 artillery technicians. Or 2) Making the training as short as absolutely possible, or even forgoing it altogether, as sacrifice needed to complete the mission assigned by strategic leadership (political and top military) to pursue their strategic planning cycles. </p>\n\n<p>Ukraine chose Option 2. </p>\n\n<p>And it&#39;s worked for them so far, up until this point they got away with it. </p>\n\n<p>And this war isn&#39;t the first they did that, the UAF top brass neglected training while pushing high OPTEMPO throughout the early violent stages of the Donbas War, which was the &quot;finishing school&quot; in terms of military life experiences for most senior Ukrainian generals, it was THE defining parts of their military careers before this war started. </p>\n\n<p>They learned lessons from that war, that were reinforced by their own military culture (with its strong Soviet lean, including lessons from The Great Patriotic War), so many think they learned good lessons that training is overrated. But the way learning lessons works in real life is sometimes lessons learned aren&#39;t good, sometimes bad lessons are learned simply because they the person didn&#39;t suffer repercussions for bad decisions due to an untold number of reasons. But its a well known problem, and why analyzing performance is such a big part now when it comes to any effective training plan, regardless of the field. </p>\n\n<p>Additional issues, besides unwillingness to allow troops to &quot;waste time&quot; for extended periods training when they can be fighting (which is the attitude that drives such decision making), are some that you mention, namely lack of trainers. </p>\n\n<p>What it appears to be is that Ukraine OPTEMPO is too high to spare the troops, so UAF isn&#39;t sparing the NCOs and officers especially that are necessary for large scale quality training in their rear areas. When that became a problem, the West pitched in and offered to help. </p>\n\n<p>They do that with a mix of western ex-military private military contractor companies operating in Ukraine, as well as NATO assistance, doing a mix of necessary technical training on foreign equipment and some types of advanced training (mainly medical), initial/basic training of the sort to produce junior enlisted infantry riflemen (which was only created when it became apparently Ukraine couldn&#39;t train enough), and then the US Army&#39;s 5 week battalion level combined arms course, which only started in late January and has a limited capacity. </p>\n\n<p>Would it be possible to expand training? Absolutely, every major combatant in WW2 did it, and in subsequent wars. But it will require sacrifices. The US will need to deploy more forces to Europe to run their parts of training, and other NATO partners will need to up their anty too. But more so, the Ukrainian top brass needs to chill out, pull back on the throttle, downshift, etc., and recognize that their strategic reserve of available troops receiving training doesn&#39;t need to be committed just because they&#39;re technical available (which is what&#39;s been happening according to western PMC trainers, in the middle of training that is already short they&#39;ll pull entire classes to send them to the front). </p>\n\n<p>With limited resources for trainers, they can&#39;t do longer training unless the overall number of trainees is limited, or the number of trainers is increased. Likewise, they can&#39;t do longer training if the UAF wont let them, because they want the bodies fighting versus giving them the time for longer training in the rear. </p>\n\n<p>I wrote <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uy5zcd/comment/ia48yrz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">this post in March of 2022</a>, when it became the war wouldn&#39;t end after the initial invasion, plus <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uy5zcd/comment/ia571y4/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">this post</a> too specifically about my doubts if NATO training would even be right for the Ukrainians.

Its another to get all of those different systems and all the units working in perfect harmony and synchronicity. </p>\n\n<p>I can teach you how to play a guitar in a few weeks enough to make some musical sounds that don&#39;t want to make people boo your efforts. Its another thing entirely to get you to the level that you and your new band are ready to play a packed stadium of fans who want to hear a flawless set. And that is what combined arms is, a flawless set by a highly experience band where everyone is in sync. If you think that is easy to achieve, sign up in your military, you&#39;ll be a general in a month.</p>\n</div>",

However, a detente could be the difference between, say, formalizing The Quad vs India falling back into its traditional (semi) neutrality. After all, India and China had broadly decent relations between the 1962 war and 2020 border clashes, despite the structural challenges you named. The Chinese will be hoping they can take ties back to something nearing that. \n\n>There was something else happening that reduced trade in 2020. I would be interested to see changes since 2019.\n\nFair enough. It seems that trade increased from $90 billion in 2019 to $137 billion in 2022.

However, a detente could be the difference between, say, formalizing The Quad vs India falling back into its traditional (semi) neutrality.
