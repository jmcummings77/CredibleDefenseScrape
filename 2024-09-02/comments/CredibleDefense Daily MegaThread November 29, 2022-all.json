He said he wants the US to give Ukraine a decisive advantage through the punishing winter months ahead.</p>\n\n<p>Zelenskiy is \u201cwilling to fight through the winter on this, the Russians aren\u2019t,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>McCaul says he plans to devote some of his committee\u2019s first hearings to war crimes committed by Russian forces in Ukraine and to the successes of the Ukrainian military.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond the current situation in Ukraine, McCaul said he wants to focus his tenure at the helm of the committee on what he called the \u201cunholy alliance\u201d of China, Russia, Iran and North Korea. Of those, he said his main focus will be on China.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re selling a tremendous amount of technology to China that they then use in their most advanced weapons systems,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just need to stop doing that.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

They told CNBC that anxiety was rising in Moscow over how the war was progressing.\n\n>\u201cSince September, I see a lot of changes [in Russia] and a lot of fears,\u201d Tatiana Stanovaya, a nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and founder and head of political analysis firm R.Politik, told CNBC.\n\n>>\u201cFor the first time since the war started people are beginning to consider the worst-case scenario, that Russia can lose, and they don\u2019t see and don\u2019t understand how Russia can get out from this conflict without being destroyed. People are very anxious, they believe that what is going on is a disaster,\u201d she said Monday.\n\n>Putin has tried to distance himself from a series of humiliating defeats on the battlefield for Russia, first with the withdrawal from the Kyiv region in northern Ukraine, then the withdrawal from Kharkiv in northeastern Ukraine and recently, the withdrawal from a chunk of Kherson in southern Ukraine, a region that Putin had said was Russia\u2019s \u201cforever\u201d only six weeks before the retreat. Needless to say, that latest withdrawal darkened the mood even among the most ardent Putin supporters.\n\n>Those seismic events in the war have also been accompanied by smaller but significant losses of face for Russia, such as the attack on the Crimean bridge linking the Russian mainland to the Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014, attacks on its Black Sea Fleet in Crimea and the withdrawal from Snake Island.\n\n>Pro-Kremlin commentators and military bloggers have lambasted Russia\u2019s military command for the series of defeats while most have been careful not to criticize Putin directly, a dangerous move in a country where criticizing the war (or \u201cspecial military operation\u201d as the Kremlin calls it) can land people in prison.\n\n>Another Russian analyst said Putin is increasingly desperate not to lose the war.\n\n>\u201cThe very fact that Russia is still waging this war, despite its apparent defeats in March [when its forces withdrew from Kyiv], indicate that Putin is desperate to not lose. Losing is not an option for him,\u201d Ilya Matveev, a political scientist and academic formerly based in St. Petersburg, told CNBC on Monday.\n\n>>\u201cI think that already everyone, including Putin, realized that even tactical nuclear weapons will not solve the problem for Russia. They cannot just stop [the] military advances of [the] Ukrainian army, it\u2019s impossible. Tactical weapons ... cannot decisively change [the] situation on the ground.\u201d\n\n>Putin more \u2018vulnerable\u2019 than ever\n\n>Putin is widely seen to have misjudged international support for Ukraine going in to the war, and has looked increasingly fallible \u2014 and vulnerable \u2014 as the conflict drags on and losses mount.\n\n>Ukraine says more than 88,000 Russian troops have been killed since the war started on Feb. 24, although the true number is hard to verify given the chaotic nature of recording deaths. For its part, Russia has rarely published its version of Russian fatalities but the number is far lower. In September, Russia\u2019s defense minister said almost 6,000 of its troops had been killed in Ukraine.\n\n>\u201cFrom the moment on 24th of February, Putin launched this war, he has become more vulnerable than he has ever been,\u201d R.Politik\u2019s Stanovaya said.\n\n>>\u201cEvery step makes him more and more vulnerable. In fact, in [the] long term, I don\u2019t see a scenario where he could be a winner. There is no scenario where he can win. In some ways, we can say that he is politically doomed,\u201d she said Monday.\n\n>>\u201cOf course, if tomorrow, let\u2019s imagine some fantasy that Zelenskyy says, \u2018OK, we have to capitulate, we sign all the demands by Russia,\u2019 then in this case we can say that Putin can have a little chance to restore his leadership inside of Russia, but it will not happen.\u201d\n\n>\u201cWe can expect new failures, new setbacks,\u201d she said.\n\n>\u2018Putin will not give up\u2019\n\n>While the war has certainly not gone Moscow\u2019s way so far \u2014 it\u2019s believed that Putin\u2019s military commanders had led the president to believe that the war would only last a couple of weeks and that Ukraine would be easily overwhelmed \u2014 Russia has certainly inflicted massive damage and destruction.\n\n>Many villages, towns and cities have been shelled relentlessly, killing civilians and destroying civilian infrastructure and prompting millions of people to flee the country.\n\n>For those who have stayed, the recent Russian strategy of widespread bombing of energy infrastructure across the country has made for extremely hostile living conditions with power blackouts a daily occurrence as well as general energy and water shortages, just as temperatures plummet.\n\n>Russia has launched more than 16,000 missiles attacks on Ukraine since the start its invasion, Ukraine\u2019s defense minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said Monday, with 97% of these strikes aimed at civilian targets, he said via Twitter.\n\n>Russia has acknowledged deliberately targeting energy infrastructure but has repeatedly denied targeting civilian infrastructure such as residential buildings, schools and hospitals. These kinds of buildings have been struck by Russian missiles and drones on multiple occasions throughout the war, however, leading to civilian deaths and injuries.\n\n>As winter sets in, political and military analysts have questioned what will happen in Ukraine, whether we will see a last push before a period of stalemate sets in, or whether the current attritional battles, with neither side making large advances, continues.\n\n>One part of Ukraine, namely the area around Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, where fierce fighting has been taking place for weeks, has recently been likened to the Battle of Verdun in World War I with Russian and Ukrainian troops inhabiting boggy, flooded trenches and the scarred landscape is reminiscent of the fighting on the Western Front in France a century ago.\n\n>Putin is unlikely to be deterred by any war of attrition, analysts note.\n\n>\u201cAs I see Putin, he would not give up. He would not reject his initial goals in this war. He believes and will believe in Ukraine that will give up one day, so he will not step back,\u201d R.Politik\u2019s Stanovaya said, adding that this leaves only two scenarios for how the war might end.\n\n>>\u201cThis first one is that the regime in Ukraine changes, but I don\u2019t really believe [that will happen]. And the second one if the regime in Russia changes, but it will not happen tomorrow, it might take maybe one or two years,\u201d she said.\n\n>\u201cIf Russia changes politically, it will review and rethink its goals in Ukraine,\u201d she noted.\n\n>In the best scenario for Putin\u2019s regime, Stanovaya said Russia will be able \u201cto secure at least a minimum of gains it can take from Ukraine.\u201d In the worst-case scenario, \u201cit will have to retreat completely and with all [the] consequences for [the] Russian state and Russian economy.\u201d",

Needless to say, that latest withdrawal darkened the mood even among the most ardent Putin supporters.</p>\n\n<p>Those seismic events in the war have also been accompanied by smaller but significant losses of face for Russia, such as the attack on the Crimean bridge linking the Russian mainland to the Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014, attacks on its Black Sea Fleet in Crimea and the withdrawal from Snake Island.</p>\n\n<p>Pro-Kremlin commentators and military bloggers have lambasted Russia\u2019s military command for the series of defeats while most have been careful not to criticize Putin directly, a dangerous move in a country where criticizing the war (or \u201cspecial military operation\u201d as the Kremlin calls it) can land people in prison.</p>\n\n<p>Another Russian analyst said Putin is increasingly desperate not to lose the war.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe very fact that Russia is still waging this war, despite its apparent defeats in March [when its forces withdrew from Kyiv], indicate that Putin is desperate to not lose. Losing is not an option for him,\u201d Ilya Matveev, a political scientist and academic formerly based in St. Petersburg, told CNBC on Monday.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cI think that already everyone, including Putin, realized that even tactical nuclear weapons will not solve the problem for Russia. They cannot just stop [the] military advances of [the] Ukrainian army, it\u2019s impossible. Tactical weapons ... cannot decisively change [the] situation on the ground.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Putin more \u2018vulnerable\u2019 than ever</p>\n\n<p>Putin is widely seen to have misjudged international support for Ukraine going in to the war, and has looked increasingly fallible \u2014 and vulnerable \u2014 as the conflict drags on and losses mount.</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine says more than 88,000 Russian troops have been killed since the war started on Feb. 24, although the true number is hard to verify given the chaotic nature of recording deaths. For its part, Russia has rarely published its version of Russian fatalities but the number is far lower. In September, Russia\u2019s defense minister said almost 6,000 of its troops had been killed in Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cFrom the moment on 24th of February, Putin launched this war, he has become more vulnerable than he has ever been,\u201d R.Politik\u2019s Stanovaya said.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cEvery step makes him more and more vulnerable. In fact, in [the] long term, I don\u2019t see a scenario where he could be a winner. There is no scenario where he can win. In some ways, we can say that he is politically doomed,\u201d she said Monday.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOf course, if tomorrow, let\u2019s imagine some fantasy that Zelenskyy says, \u2018OK, we have to capitulate, we sign all the demands by Russia,\u2019 then in this case we can say that Putin can have a little chance to restore his leadership inside of Russia, but it will not happen.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\u201cWe can expect new failures, new setbacks,\u201d she said.</p>\n\n<p>\u2018Putin will not give up\u2019</p>\n\n<p>While the war has certainly not gone Moscow\u2019s way so far \u2014 it\u2019s believed that Putin\u2019s military commanders had led the president to believe that the war would only last a couple of weeks and that Ukraine would be easily overwhelmed \u2014 Russia has certainly inflicted massive damage and destruction.</p>\n\n<p>Many villages, towns and cities have been shelled relentlessly, killing civilians and destroying civilian infrastructure and prompting millions of people to flee the country.</p>\n\n<p>For those who have stayed, the recent Russian strategy of widespread bombing of energy infrastructure across the country has made for extremely hostile living conditions with power blackouts a daily occurrence as well as general energy and water shortages, just as temperatures plummet.</p>\n\n<p>Russia has launched more than 16,000 missiles attacks on Ukraine since the start its invasion, Ukraine\u2019s defense minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said Monday, with 97% of these strikes aimed at civilian targets, he said via Twitter.</p>\n\n<p>Russia has acknowledged deliberately targeting energy infrastructure but has repeatedly denied targeting civilian infrastructure such as residential buildings, schools and hospitals. These kinds of buildings have been struck by Russian missiles and drones on multiple occasions throughout the war, however, leading to civilian deaths and injuries.</p>\n\n<p>As winter sets in, political and military analysts have questioned what will happen in Ukraine, whether we will see a last push before a period of stalemate sets in, or whether the current attritional battles, with neither side making large advances, continues.</p>\n\n<p>One part of Ukraine, namely the area around Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, where fierce fighting has been taking place for weeks, has recently been likened to the Battle of Verdun in World War I with Russian and Ukrainian troops inhabiting boggy, flooded trenches and the scarred landscape is reminiscent of the fighting on the Western Front in France a century ago.</p>\n\n<p>Putin is unlikely to be deterred by any war of attrition, analysts note.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAs I see Putin, he would not give up. He would not reject his initial goals in this war. He believes and will believe in Ukraine that will give up one day, so he will not step back,\u201d R.Politik\u2019s Stanovaya said, adding that this leaves only two scenarios for how the war might end.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cThis first one is that the regime in Ukraine changes, but I don\u2019t really believe [that will happen]. And the second one if the regime in Russia changes, but it will not happen tomorrow, it might take maybe one or two years,\u201d she said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\u201cIf Russia changes politically, it will review and rethink its goals in Ukraine,\u201d she noted.</p>\n\n<p>In the best scenario for Putin\u2019s regime, Stanovaya said Russia will be able \u201cto secure at least a minimum of gains it can take from Ukraine.\u201d In the worst-case scenario, \u201cit will have to retreat completely and with all [the] consequences for [the] Russian state and Russian economy.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

            "body": "This is very difficult to assess. \"Enough\" equipment for combat operations goes way beyond a coat and sleeping bag for every person. Anything worn in the trenches will get wet, and those out in the cold and wet will lose a lot of energy. In order to operate in cold, wet conditions for long periods of time you *must* get troops out of their wet clothes and into warm, dry clothes on a regular basis (like daily.) This requires dry places with clothes that are kept dry, and that troops have the discipline to keep their wet and dry gear separate. This also requires a LOT of calories. Being cold and wet all day is going to easily burn 4000+ calories a day. Operating in the cold goes way beyond handing out a set of winter gear and calling it a day; managing exposure and recovery is vital. It remains to be seen how well Russia will manage, and I don't see any way to predict this given the complexities.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>This is very difficult to assess. &quot;Enough&quot; equipment for combat operations goes way beyond a coat and sleeping bag for every person. Anything worn in the trenches will get wet, and those out in the cold and wet will lose a lot of energy. In order to operate in cold, wet conditions for long periods of time you <em>must</em> get troops out of their wet clothes and into warm, dry clothes on a regular basis (like daily.) This requires dry places with clothes that are kept dry, and that troops have the discipline to keep their wet and dry gear separate. This also requires a LOT of calories.

This is intended to replace the B-1 Lancer and B-2 Spirit in the strategic bombing and nuclear role, it makes little sense to keep a deterrence platform secret. </p>\n\n<p>Also, no idea why people are saying that it&#39;s impossible to conceal an aerospace project&#39;s existence. If the US government wanted to, it absolutely could keep the B-21 secret perpetually. In fact, there are undoubtedly top-secret airframes in flight right now--unless all those pulse-engine contrail reports are mass hallucinations. Even Space Force has stated it has platforms/capabilities the public doesn&#39;t know about yet, and satellites are even more tracked than airspace is.</p>\n</div>",

            "body": "I would just push back a little to suggest that, in terms of capabilities, the Russians should be able to produce much of the equipment they now field. The Soviet Union was fundamentally autarkic, and struggled with miniaturization and computerization. Baseline models of the T-72, T-80, and even SU-27 and S-300 were made at Soviet levels of computerization, which even in the late 1980s was crude. Keep in mind the T-80 didn't even come with a thermal sight! Though one was in the prototype stages. After the collapse of the USSR, a *lot* of Soviet heavy industry, propped up by state budgets, just died. The arms industry wasn't spared from this, but then the arms industry remained one of the few industries in new Russia which produced goods with global demand.\n\nBasically the Russian army now fields what the USSR was prototyping for the 1990s, with the exception of genuinely Russian designs like the T-14 and SU-57. And those systems have a tremendous amount of teething issues, and may not be fit for mass production. Everything else, including the vaunted SU-35, modern S-300s, and the T-90, are Soviet-era weapons given new license with digital systems initially procured from the west. These new systems are where the crunch is. Russia could surely continue to churn out T-72Bs, call them T-90M obr 2022. They could I'm sure keep churning out SU-35s and -27s. A lot of these weapons rely on parts that have always been made in Russia. The question, as you point out, is what about the digital equipment that makes a T-90 or an SU-35 competitive on the modern battlefield? That we dont know. There are obviously serious issues. For example the T-72B3, modernized T-80s, and T-90Ms all relied on imported chips in, \\~2014. France, for example, supplied most of the Thermal Optics in use by the Russian Army at that time. But even before the first invasion, Russia began to transition from direct imports to licensed production. We dont really know how well that on-shoring worked, or how 2014 disrupted it. I have read that France in particular evaded sanctions on at least several occasions to sell equipment to Russia. It may be that there was little disruption thanks to 2014 and Russia now *does* have at least limited domestic capacity. They certainly have all the raw resources to do the job, they just need the machine tools and human capital. But what industries, making what equipment, in what quantities, with what kind of slack which Putin could now mobilize is anyone's guess. And China/the Consumer market is a real x factor. Youre obviously not going to be buying missile guidance systems on Ali Express, but if the Sahed proves one thing its that you can jury rig lots of these systems together using strictly consumer grade hardware. The gap between prosumer and military grade has never been closer, and China is a *massive* producer and exporter of basically everything. China could just sell Russia missiles, thermal optics, and computer systems. They could also sell them the key boards required to make Russian made thermal optics, missiles, and computer systems work. China has their own version of basically every system Russia needs, and are very comfortable working with Soviet-style equipment.\n\nRussia has been cut off from one supplier (Europe) totally, and that hurts them. Ten years ago Europe was a vital trading partner. But unlike ten years ago they have options now they didn't then, and they also have an ally of sorts who is the world's workshop. IMO a lot is now down to the Chinese Russian relationship, and thats really an unknown.  So I think the safe bet is that Russian domestic production is down, probably significantly, from its prewar level. How far down is anyone's guess They can fill this gap by simply stripping out systems and making less advanced equipment. What would be the impact of a T-72B4 obr 2022 with all the flashy stuff taken out? Would Ukraine simply cut through them, or is there a fundamental soundness to the platform which would make them an issue? We basically come back to the same issue as with the Mobiks. As Stalin once said, \"quantity has a quality all its own\" and Russia's strategy now is a big bet on the truth of that statement.\n\n*edit*: just as a follow up to this and to illustrate my point, I was looking at the T-72 page on Tankograd. I knew that early model T-72s used a layered armor, mixing steel plates and a ballistic glass known as Textolite to create its composite armor array. I was wondering if there were more details, apparently not. But Tankograd does say that late model B T-72s, and the first Soviet T-90 prototypes, dispensed with all composite layering and instead created an air-steel array. \n\n>The design of the upper glacis armour array of the \"Improved T-72A\" represented the first major design change in the upper glacis armour of all Soviet main battle tanks since the addition of a steel back plate to the STB composite armour of the Object 432 obr. 1964. Instead, the new armour features spaced high hardness steel plates as inserts. In the collection of memoirs \"Life Given to Tanks\", it is stated by V. D. Tumasov (head of the Department of Armour in UKBTM) that the new armour design was a multilayered array of steel and air, as opposed to composite armour with various fillers. This is corroborated in the book \"T-72/T-90: \u041e\u043f\u044b\u0442 \u0441\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043e\u0442\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0431\u043e\u0435\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u0442\u0430\u043d\u043a\u043e\u0432\" published by the Uralvagonzavod corporation in 2013, where the new armour was described as flat parallel plates with inserts made of high hardness steel. In essence, both describe a multilayered spaced armour array with RHA front and back plates with high hardness steel plate inserts.    \n>  \n>Source ( [https://thesovietarmourblog.blogspot.com/2017/12/t-72-part-2.html#reflection1](https://thesovietarmourblog.blogspot.com/2017/12/t-72-part-2.html#reflection1) )\n\nand later\n\n>The thickness of the armour remained the same as that of 60-105-50 design. The omission of STB was ordered by UKBTM Chief Designer V. N. Vendiktov. He specified that the increase in armour mass had to be minimal, and that the protection requirement had to be achieved without using glass textolite. One of the reasons was its cost. Glass textolite is produced using laminated glass mats, and glass mats are the most expensive filler for glass reinforced plastics as stated on page 21 of the book \"\u0421\u0442\u0435\u043a\u043b\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\" (\"Glass Textolite\"). There were also some safety concerns, as glass fibers are dangerous to inhale.\n\nand later\n\n>The upper glacis armour of the T-72B was a further development of the \"Reflection-1\" project, which had been implemented on T-72 tanks since 1983. The lighter \"Reflection-1\" armour (60-15-15-15-50) that was used for the \"Improved T-72A\" tanks from 1983 and 1984 yielded a very modest gain in weight compared to the 16-60-105-50 armour array, but due to the higher efficiency against KE threats, the effect is that the new armour array approaches or reaches 500mm RHA in effective thickness, which is very good. This was sufficient protection against the 105mm gun threat, but providing security from the new APFSDS ammunition developed for the British L11 and L30 rifled 120mm guns and the new 120mm gun observed on the new German Leopard 2 tank was a more difficult task that required a further gain in protection value, which necessitated a gain in armour mass.\n\nA photograph is [included](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rAs8VKXbGIg/Xn29zTryDEI/AAAAAAAAQdw/89UY12E4a38ewnDuct9qlzG5DJ6Ck070gCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/t-72b%2B1985%2Bglacis%2Barmour.png) of a T-72B3 damaged in the 2015 tank biathlon which shows how this armor is constructed, as well as demonstrating that B3s even maintain this all-steel construction. The article also goes on to describe the composition of the T-72B's \"Super Dolly Parton\" turret construction, which features a substantial NERA array. These NERA panels, though, are made from rubber sandwiched by steel plates. \n\nThere conclusion here should be that there isn't anything so exotic in the construction of a T-72B that Russia could not, if it wanted to, replicate. That is, it should be easy for them to go from steel ingots to a combat capable tank (how quickly, in what numbers? Who knows) with whatever it has today, assuming the machine tools still exist. What remains then is what makes the tank modern. What kind of FCS can Russia produce domestically, it has to be some, and what kind of ammo at what level of capacity? Plus thermal optics. Weve seen Russia doesn't really have trouble producing Kontakt-5 ERA either.",

Baseline models of the T-72, T-80, and even SU-27 and S-300 were made at Soviet levels of computerization, which even in the late 1980s was crude. Keep in mind the T-80 didn&#39;t even come with a thermal sight! Though one was in the prototype stages. After the collapse of the USSR, a <em>lot</em> of Soviet heavy industry, propped up by state budgets, just died. The arms industry wasn&#39;t spared from this, but then the arms industry remained one of the few industries in new Russia which produced goods with global demand.</p>\n\n<p>Basically the Russian army now fields what the USSR was prototyping for the 1990s, with the exception of genuinely Russian designs like the T-14 and SU-57. And those systems have a tremendous amount of teething issues, and may not be fit for mass production. Everything else, including the vaunted SU-35, modern S-300s, and the T-90, are Soviet-era weapons given new license with digital systems initially procured from the west. These new systems are where the crunch is. Russia could surely continue to churn out T-72Bs, call them T-90M obr 2022. They could I&#39;m sure keep churning out SU-35s and -27s. A lot of these weapons rely on parts that have always been made in Russia. The question, as you point out, is what about the digital equipment that makes a T-90 or an SU-35 competitive on the modern battlefield? That we dont know. There are obviously serious issues. For example the T-72B3, modernized T-80s, and T-90Ms all relied on imported chips in, ~2014. France, for example, supplied most of the Thermal Optics in use by the Russian Army at that time. But even before the first invasion, Russia began to transition from direct imports to licensed production. We dont really know how well that on-shoring worked, or how 2014 disrupted it. I have read that France in particular evaded sanctions on at least several occasions to sell equipment to Russia. It may be that there was little disruption thanks to 2014 and Russia now <em>does</em> have at least limited domestic capacity. They certainly have all the raw resources to do the job, they just need the machine tools and human capital. But what industries, making what equipment, in what quantities, with what kind of slack which Putin could now mobilize is anyone&#39;s guess. And China/the Consumer market is a real x factor. Youre obviously not going to be buying missile guidance systems on Ali Express, but if the Sahed proves one thing its that you can jury rig lots of these systems together using strictly consumer grade hardware. The gap between prosumer and military grade has never been closer, and China is a <em>massive</em> producer and exporter of basically everything. China could just sell Russia missiles, thermal optics, and computer systems. They could also sell them the key boards required to make Russian made thermal optics, missiles, and computer systems work. China has their own version of basically every system Russia needs, and are very comfortable working with Soviet-style equipment.</p>\n\n<p>Russia has been cut off from one supplier (Europe) totally, and that hurts them. Ten years ago Europe was a vital trading partner. But unlike ten years ago they have options now they didn&#39;t then, and they also have an ally of sorts who is the world&#39;s workshop. IMO a lot is now down to the Chinese Russian relationship, and thats really an unknown.  So I think the safe bet is that Russian domestic production is down, probably significantly, from its prewar level. How far down is anyone&#39;s guess They can fill this gap by simply stripping out systems and making less advanced equipment. What would be the impact of a T-72B4 obr 2022 with all the flashy stuff taken out? Would Ukraine simply cut through them, or is there a fundamental soundness to the platform which would make them an issue? We basically come back to the same issue as with the Mobiks. As Stalin once said, &quot;quantity has a quality all its own&quot; and Russia&#39;s strategy now is a big bet on the truth of that statement.</p>\n\n<p><em>edit</em>: just as a follow up to this and to illustrate my point, I was looking at the T-72 page on Tankograd. I knew that early model T-72s used a layered armor, mixing steel plates and a ballistic glass known as Textolite to create its composite armor array. I was wondering if there were more details, apparently not. But Tankograd does say that late model B T-72s, and the first Soviet T-90 prototypes, dispensed with all composite layering and instead created an air-steel array. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The design of the upper glacis armour array of the &quot;Improved T-72A&quot; represented the first major design change in the upper glacis armour of all Soviet main battle tanks since the addition of a steel back plate to the STB composite armour of the Object 432 obr. 1964. Instead, the new armour features spaced high hardness steel plates as inserts. In the collection of memoirs &quot;Life Given to Tanks&quot;, it is stated by V. D. Tumasov (head of the Department of Armour in UKBTM) that the new armour design was a multilayered array of steel and air, as opposed to composite armour with various fillers. This is corroborated in the book &quot;T-72/T-90: \u041e\u043f\u044b\u0442 \u0441\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043e\u0442\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0431\u043e\u0435\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u0442\u0430\u043d\u043a\u043e\u0432&quot; published by the Uralvagonzavod corporation in 2013, where the new armour was described as flat parallel plates with inserts made of high hardness steel. In essence, both describe a multilayered spaced armour array with RHA front and back plates with high hardness steel plate inserts.    </p>\n\n<p>Source ( <a href=\"https://thesovietarmourblog.blogspot.com/2017/12/t-72-part-2.html#reflection1\">https://thesovietarmourblog.blogspot.com/2017/12/t-72-part-2.html#reflection1</a> )</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and later</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The thickness of the armour remained the same as that of 60-105-50 design. The omission of STB was ordered by UKBTM Chief Designer V. N. Vendiktov. He specified that the increase in armour mass had to be minimal, and that the protection requirement had to be achieved without using glass textolite. One of the reasons was its cost. Glass textolite is produced using laminated glass mats, and glass mats are the most expensive filler for glass reinforced plastics as stated on page 21 of the book &quot;\u0421\u0442\u0435\u043a\u043b\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442&quot; (&quot;Glass Textolite&quot;). There were also some safety concerns, as glass fibers are dangerous to inhale.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and later</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The upper glacis armour of the T-72B was a further development of the &quot;Reflection-1&quot; project, which had been implemented on T-72 tanks since 1983. The lighter &quot;Reflection-1&quot; armour (60-15-15-15-50) that was used for the &quot;Improved T-72A&quot; tanks from 1983 and 1984 yielded a very modest gain in weight compared to the 16-60-105-50 armour array, but due to the higher efficiency against KE threats, the effect is that the new armour array approaches or reaches 500mm RHA in effective thickness, which is very good. This was sufficient protection against the 105mm gun threat, but providing security from the new APFSDS ammunition developed for the British L11 and L30 rifled 120mm guns and the new 120mm gun observed on the new German Leopard 2 tank was a more difficult task that required a further gain in protection value, which necessitated a gain in armour mass.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A photograph is <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rAs8VKXbGIg/Xn29zTryDEI/AAAAAAAAQdw/89UY12E4a38ewnDuct9qlzG5DJ6Ck070gCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/t-72b%2B1985%2Bglacis%2Barmour.png\">included</a> of a T-72B3 damaged in the 2015 tank biathlon which shows how this armor is constructed, as well as demonstrating that B3s even maintain this all-steel construction. The article also goes on to describe the composition of the T-72B&#39;s &quot;Super Dolly Parton&quot; turret construction, which features a substantial NERA array. These NERA panels, though, are made from rubber sandwiched by steel plates. </p>\n\n<p>There conclusion here should be that there isn&#39;t anything so exotic in the construction of a T-72B that Russia could not, if it wanted to, replicate. That is, it should be easy for them to go from steel ingots to a combat capable tank (how quickly, in what numbers? Who knows) with whatever it has today, assuming the machine tools still exist. What remains then is what makes the tank modern. What kind of FCS can Russia produce domestically, it has to be some, and what kind of ammo at what level of capacity? Plus thermal optics. Weve seen Russia doesn&#39;t really have trouble producing Kontakt-5 ERA either.</p>\n</div>",

                            "body": "Well, re: the peace dividend it did happen. It just wasn't as big as people thought it was going to be. A lot of programs were canceled, and even more never started. AirLand Battle 2000 was in the draft stages and would have required a pretty major buildup, akin to the one that followed AirLand Battle 1982. And it would have introduced a lot of the stuff were only now beginning to see come into play with the GWOT and this war. Drones, for example. If you trace the heritage of most US drones in service, their forefathers are Israeli drones acquired and reproduced in the US in the 1980s, ALB 2000 would have placed a greater emphasis on incorporating these weapons. We really only began to see that with the GWOT. But some of these loitering kill-vehicle ideas which people now identify with this war, or for example drone-strike platforms like the Sahed, were first pitched by the authors of ALB 2000. Except their version of the Sahed would have a much longer range and loiter time. Because it didn't use an air-breathing engine. Because it used an electric engine. Powered buy an atomic reactor. Probably glad that idea never got off the table. There were other hairbrained schemes though, like a full body VR rig for soldier training. That would have been complete, with googles, fake gun, computer links, and body resistance suit. That got canceled in 1990 iirc.\n\nSo there *was* a peace dividend. The issue was that the Army, like the other services, fought hard to retain structure. They didn't want to see units cut, and as much as possible fought to either push off cuts, or get units transferred into the Army National Guard where manpower costs decreased but support costs remained high. So there wasn't as much cash that could be recouped to the federal budget. What did change, though, was that spending froze. So interestingly we now pay about half as much, as a ratio of GDP, as people paid in Reagan's day. They were at about 5.5% defense to GDP, in 2016 it was something like 2.5%. So it makes sense that A) we dont get as much cool stuff, and B) there was an unseen peace dividend (which is personally how I would phrase it, maybe thats semantics though?) *edit:* the peak of the Reagan buildup was actually in 1985. From 1985 through 2001 the US defense budget basically froze, creating the collapse in the spending:GDP ratio. Even in the 1980s Congress was pretty skeptical of the unfettered buildup, and a few notable program failures including two! aircraft projects really ended the Reagan buildup. That and most of its more realistic goals had been met. \n\nI do agree though it seems like the modern MIC has lost the plot a bit though with how much they get away with. Again, IMO, most politicians just arn't willing to hold them to account as they did before. But its more complicated, and not just an issue with contractors. There are political issues, the people who should know better are too cozy with lobbyist and generals, while those who actually try to make a case for economy are often a bit too far out of touch to make a credible argument. But just as much, people forget why the system was set up the way it was. A great book here is *From Cotton Belt to Sun Belt*. It talks about the economic transformation of the south from the 1930s to the 1950s. The primary focus is on the New Deal, but the New Deal had far less impact on the Southern economy that most people think. Instead it was WWII and the spending there that turned, for example Atlanta, from a cotton & agriculture hub into a major manufacturing center. Specifically it was Aeronautics spending and plane factories. Through the 60s and 70s, politicians were willing to accept some inefficiencies in contracting if it meant wealth transfer into their poor, generally southern, districts (something something socialism). But then the people who set the system up died, and the people who replaced them had very little understanding of *why* things were done the way they were. They just assumed that the MIC was inefficient and so what. Security from the Soviet Union was all that mattered, but when that disappeared?\n\nIm stealing this argument from another book I've read, I can see the cover of it but cant think of the name.

                            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Well, re: the peace dividend it did happen. It just wasn&#39;t as big as people thought it was going to be. A lot of programs were canceled, and even more never started. AirLand Battle 2000 was in the draft stages and would have required a pretty major buildup, akin to the one that followed AirLand Battle 1982. And it would have introduced a lot of the stuff were only now beginning to see come into play with the GWOT and this war. Drones, for example. If you trace the heritage of most US drones in service, their forefathers are Israeli drones acquired and reproduced in the US in the 1980s, ALB 2000 would have placed a greater emphasis on incorporating these weapons. We really only began to see that with the GWOT. But some of these loitering kill-vehicle ideas which people now identify with this war, or for example drone-strike platforms like the Sahed, were first pitched by the authors of ALB 2000. Except their version of the Sahed would have a much longer range and loiter time. Because it didn&#39;t use an air-breathing engine. Because it used an electric engine. Powered buy an atomic reactor. Probably glad that idea never got off the table. There were other hairbrained schemes though, like a full body VR rig for soldier training. That would have been complete, with googles, fake gun, computer links, and body resistance suit. That got canceled in 1990 iirc.</p>\n\n<p>So there <em>was</em> a peace dividend. The issue was that the Army, like the other services, fought hard to retain structure. They didn&#39;t want to see units cut, and as much as possible fought to either push off cuts, or get units transferred into the Army National Guard where manpower costs decreased but support costs remained high. So there wasn&#39;t as much cash that could be recouped to the federal budget. What did change, though, was that spending froze. So interestingly we now pay about half as much, as a ratio of GDP, as people paid in Reagan&#39;s day. They were at about 5.5% defense to GDP, in 2016 it was something like 2.5%. So it makes sense that A) we dont get as much cool stuff, and B) there was an unseen peace dividend (which is personally how I would phrase it, maybe thats semantics though?) <em>edit:</em> the peak of the Reagan buildup was actually in 1985. From 1985 through 2001 the US defense budget basically froze, creating the collapse in the spending:GDP ratio. Even in the 1980s Congress was pretty skeptical of the unfettered buildup, and a few notable program failures including two! aircraft projects really ended the Reagan buildup. That and most of its more realistic goals had been met. </p>\n\n<p>I do agree though it seems like the modern MIC has lost the plot a bit though with how much they get away with. Again, IMO, most politicians just arn&#39;t willing to hold them to account as they did before. But its more complicated, and not just an issue with contractors. There are political issues, the people who should know better are too cozy with lobbyist and generals, while those who actually try to make a case for economy are often a bit too far out of touch to make a credible argument. But just as much, people forget why the system was set up the way it was. A great book here is <em>From Cotton Belt to Sun Belt</em>. It talks about the economic transformation of the south from the 1930s to the 1950s. The primary focus is on the New Deal, but the New Deal had far less impact on the Southern economy that most people think. Instead it was WWII and the spending there that turned, for example Atlanta, from a cotton &amp; agriculture hub into a major manufacturing center. Specifically it was Aeronautics spending and plane factories. Through the 60s and 70s, politicians were willing to accept some inefficiencies in contracting if it meant wealth transfer into their poor, generally southern, districts (something something socialism). But then the people who set the system up died, and the people who replaced them had very little understanding of <em>why</em> things were done the way they were. They just assumed that the MIC was inefficient and so what. Security from the Soviet Union was all that mattered, but when that disappeared?</p>\n\n<p>Im stealing this argument from another book I&#39;ve read, I can see the cover of it but cant think of the name. Has a cool eagle on it. If I can think of the name I&#39;ll update the comment. But I find it pretty compelling. Supporting the MIC used to be pragmatic, now its symbolistic. And thats, obviously, a big issue. But I also have hope, the threat of China may well get the stooges back into line.</p>\n</div>",
