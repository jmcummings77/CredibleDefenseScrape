                "body": "Different scenario. \n\nLike in SPR, a defender laying waste to an attacking forces and stacking them like cordwood ends up getting outflanked, throws up his hands and tries to surrender against the very troops who he was mowing down just moments before, there is a very high chance that individual is getting smoked. Not only is the \"blood up\" on the attacker by way of a massive adrenaline dump caused by fear/terror but also desire for retribution and clear opportunity to get it.

In a video address to the nation, President Zelenskiy suspended SBU head Ivan Bakanov, whom he has known for years, citing the large number of SBU staff suspected of treason. Ukrainian law enforcement sources told Reuters that some SBU staff recounted in conversation with them that they were unable to reach Bakanov for several days after Russia invaded, adding to a sense of chaos in Kyiv. Bakanov didn\u2019t respond to Reuters\u2019 requests for comment.\n\nZelenskiy also said 651 cases of alleged treason and collaboration have been opened against individuals involved in law enforcement and in the prosecutor\u2019s office. More than 60 officials from the SBU and the prosecutor general\u2019s office are working against Ukraine in Russian-occupied zones, Zelenskiy added.\n\nAsked to comment on Reuters\u2019 findings, the Ukrainian presidential administration, the SBU and the prosecutor general\u2019s office did not respond. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: \u201cAll these questions have no relation whatsoever to us, therefore there is nothing for us to comment on here.\u201d The Russian intelligence agency, the FSB, and the defence ministry did not respond to Reuters\u2019 questions.\n\nKGB TIES\n\nMoscow\u2019s spy apparatus has been intertwined with Chornobyl for decades. After the 1986 disaster, when a reactor blew up scattering radioactive clouds across Europe, the Soviet KGB stepped in. More than 1,000 KGB staff took part in the clean-up, according to a declassified internal memo to a Ukrainian government minister, dated 1991. Then-KGB boss Viktor Chebrikov ordered his officers to recruit agents among the plant\u2019s staff and instructed that a KGB officer should hold the post of deputy boss of the plant in charge of security, according to another memo -  an internal KGB communication from 1986.\n\nEven after Ukraine became independent in 1991, Moscow\u2019s spy chiefs remained powerful there. The first head of Ukraine's domestic intelligence service was Nikolai Golushko, who started his career in Soviet Russia. Before his appointment he led the Ukraine arm of the Soviet KGB. Golushko kept most of the Soviet-era officers in their jobs, he wrote in a 2012 memoir.\n\nAfter four months as Ukraine's spy chief, Golushko moved back to Moscow to rejoin KGB headquarters, and in 1993 became head of Russia's newly created Federal Counter-Intelligence Service, precursor to today\u2019s FSB.\n\nIn Moscow, Golushko received a visit from the deputy head of Ukraine's State Security Service, Golushko wrote in the memoir. He recalled how Oleg Pugach, the Ukrainian official, asked for Golushko's help finding fabric to make the uniforms for Ukraine\u2019s intelligence officers. Golushko also wrote that Kyiv, short of its own resources and expertise, signed deals under which the SBU agreed to share intelligence information with Moscow. In exchange, Moscow provided supplies, technology and expert help with investigations. Reuters approached Golushko for comment. A colleague from an intelligence veterans\u2019 group told Reuters Golushko, now 85, was in ill health and could not answer questions. Reuters was unable to reach Pugach and couldn\u2019t independently confirm Golushko\u2019s account.\n\nOleksiy Danilov, Secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council, pictured earlier this month. REUTERS/Valentyn Ogirenko\nIntelligence officers working at Chornobyl officially became part of  Ukraine\u2019s security apparatus in 1991, but they continued to take orders from Moscow, said the person with direct knowledge of the invasion plan. \u201cIn effect, these were FSB employees,\u201d said the person. The SBU did not respond to questions about Chornobyl or historical ties to Russian intelligence.\n\nThe Chornobyl nuclear plant is a vast facility. A giant steel structure encases Reactor No. 4, ground zero of the 1986 disaster. The plant lies just 10 kilometres at the closest point from the border with Belarus, in a dense and highly irradiated forest. Russia\u2019s war planners considered control of Chornobyl to be strategically important because it sat on the shortest route for their advance on Kyiv, according to Western military analysts.\n\nThe source with direct knowledge of the invasion plan said that in November 2021 Russia started sending undercover intelligence agents to Ukraine, tasked with establishing contacts with officials responsible for securing the Chornobyl power plant. The agents\u2019 goal was to ensure there would be no armed resistance once Russian troops rolled in. The source said Chornobyl also served as a drop-off point for documents from SBU headquarters. In return for payment, Ukrainian officials handed Russian spies information about Ukraine\u2019s military readiness.\n\nReuters could not independently verify details of the source\u2019s account, and neither Ukraine\u2019s State Bureau of Investigation nor the SBU responded to the news agency\u2019s questions. But a review of Ukrainian testimony and court documents and an interview with a local official show that Kyiv is conducting at least three investigations into the conduct of people who worked at Chornobyl. The investigations have identified at least two people suspected of providing information to Russian agents or otherwise helping them seize the plant, according to these documents.\n\nViter is in detention in Ukraine on suspicion of absenting himself from his post. An extract from the court register, seen by Reuters, shows law enforcement agents have begun a second probe into Viter, for suspected treason. His lawyer rejects the allegations.\n\nOne of the men suspected by Ukrainian prosecutors and investigators of helping Russian forces is Valentin Viter, a 47-year-old colonel in the SBU. At the time of the Russian invasion, Viter was the deputy general-director of the plant responsible for its physical protection.\n\nIn May last year, Viter oversaw a routine training exercise that was meant to simulate an attack by armed saboteurs. Armed members of the National Guard unit that protects Chornobyl took part, and rehearsed repelling the attackers by force. Viter said the exercise was a success, according to a video interview posted shortly afterwards on the plant\u2019s website. He also said he hoped Chornobyl\u2019s security team would \u201cnot need to apply the knowledge and skills we acquired in a real-life situation.\u201d\n\nViter was seconded from the SBU to work at Chornobyl as security chief in mid-2019, according to a statement he gave to investigators. In a further statement, he said that on Feb. 18 this year \u2013 six days before the Russian invasion \u2013 he went on sick leave with a respiratory problem.\n\nBy then, Russia was bolstering its troops in Belarus in preparation for an invasion, U.S. officials said at the time. Satellite images shot by U.S. satellite imagery company Maxar on Feb. 15 showed a military pontoon bridge under construction across the Pripyat River in Belarus, north of the power plant. Ukraine\u2019s police, and the SBU, were on heightened alert in response to the Russian threat, and the national police chief said in a statement at the time that security was reinforced at the Chornobyl plant.",

He telephoned the head of the Chornobyl National Guard unit, who was at his post. By then, people at the plant knew a column of Russian armoured vehicles was heading their way.\n\nViter, according to his testimony to Ukrainian investigators, told the commander, in Russian: \u201cSpare your people.\u201d Viter had no official authority over the National Guard, and Reuters could not determine whether the commander was heeding Viter\u2019s words when the unit surrendered after discussions with the Russian invaders. A National Guard statement identified the unit commander as Yuriy Pindak.\n\nWhen the Russian soldiers finally retreated from Chornobyl after a 36-day occupation, they took Pindak and most of his unit away as captives. Ukraine says the guards are being held in Russia or Belarus. Russian officials did not comment on the unit\u2019s whereabouts.\n\nUkraine\u2019s State Bureau of Investigation is conducting a probe into whether the National Guard broke the law by laying down arms, said Yuriy Fomichev, mayor of the town of Slavutych where most of the Chornobyl workers live. Fomichev said he was not aware of anyone having been charged. The State Bureau of Investigation didn\u2019t respond to Reuters\u2019 questions about the matter.\n\nThe National Guard declined to comment on the actions of individual commanders and members of the unit tasked with protecting Chornobyl. \u201cFighting on the territory of nuclear facilities is prohibited by the Geneva Convention,\u201d it said, adding that this was \u201cone of the reasons\u201d why there was no heavy fighting at the site. It referred questions about any investigation to the Bureau.\n\nArticle 56 of an additional protocol to the Geneva Conventions states that nuclear power plants and other dangerous installations should not be attacked.\n\nViter was arrested in western Ukraine and is now in pre-trial detention there on suspicion of absenting himself from his post. An extract from the court\u2019s register, seen by Reuters, shows that law enforcement agents have initiated a second investigation into Viter for suspected treason by \u201cdeliberately assisting the military units of the aggressor country, the Russian Federation, in carrying out subversive activities against Ukraine.\u201d They have yet to uncover evidence tying him to Russian special services.\n\nViter has said in court statements that he fled Kyiv for the safety of his family two days after Chornobyl was seized but tried to stay in contact with colleagues at the plant.\n\nHis lawyer, Oleksandr Kovalenko, said Viter had a legitimate reason for being off work and was unaware that he should stay at Chornobyl. The lawyer said any treason allegation was unfounded and Viter had not been served with a letter of suspicion, a step which usually precedes charges. According to the lawyer, Viter said \u201cSpare your people\u201d to remind the National Guard commander that many people depended on him. Viter did not discuss surrender, Kovalenko said. He added that investigators had not asked Viter about any exchange of documents at Chornobyl.\n\nCASH AND EMERALDS\n\nThe extent to which Russia infiltrated Chornobyl has focused Ukrainian authorities\u2019 attention on the SBU, the agency Viter worked for, sources said. In particular, military prosecutors on Viter\u2019s case are interested in his connection to a former Ukrainian official called Andriy Naumov, according to sources with knowledge of the investigation and a transcript of Viter\u2019s questioning seen by Reuters.\n\n\nRFE/RL\nANDRIY NAUMOV\nFORMER TOP INTELLIGENCE OFFICIAL\n\nNaumov vanished before the Russian invasion. He turned up in Serbia in June in a car stuffed with cash and emeralds, according to a police statement. Ukraine\u2019s State Bureau of Investigation said it is conducting a pre-trial investigation into Naumov for state treason. Naumov\u2019s lawyer declined to comment.\n\nPreviously an official in the Ukrainian prosecutor\u2019s office, by 2018 Naumov had been appointed head of COTIZ, a state enterprise responsible for estate-management of the radioactive exclusion zone around Chornobyl. A major part of COTIZ\u2019s role was to promote \u201cextreme tourism\u201d in the exclusion zone, but the enterprise also had a role in keeping the site secure, according to its website.\n\nAfter his stint at Chornobyl, Naumov was made the head of the SBU\u2019s department of internal security, a division that investigates other officers suspected of criminal activity. Last year, the agency said it thwarted an assassination attempt on Naumov by other SBU officers. Naumov was later fired as department chief, according to Ukrainian media outlet Ukrainska Pravda and a law enforcement source.\n\nNaumov vanished shortly before the invasion, a person in law enforcement said. He eventually turned up in Serbia in June. A Serbian police statement issued on June 8 said police and anti-corruption agents had arrested a Ukrainian citizen identified by the initials \u201cA.N.\u201d on the border with North Macedonia. He had been trying to cross into North Macedonia from Serbia. A search of the BMW in which he was a passenger uncovered $124,924 and 607,990 euros in cash, plus two emeralds, the statement said. It said the individual and the unnamed driver of the BMW, who was also detained, were suspected of intending to launder the cash and emeralds, which police believe originated from criminal activities. Volodymyr Tolkach, Ukraine\u2019s ambassador to Serbia, publicly confirmed the arrested man was Naumov.\n\nThe State Bureau of Investigation confirmed a local media report that it is conducting a pre-trial investigation into Naumov for state treason.

The statement did not say what grounds it had for suspecting he passed on secrets or if it had specific evidence linking him to Russia.\n\nOn March 31, President Zelenskiy issued a decree stripping Naumov of his brigadier-general rank.

Press service of State Security Service of Ukraine/Handout via REUTERS\nMedvedchuk was charged with state treason on May 11, 2021. Investigators from the SBU alleged at the time that Medvedchuk passed secret details about Ukrainian military units to Russian officials, and intended to recruit Ukrainian agents and covertly influence Ukrainian politics. The day before the invasion, he left his home in Kyiv and was planning on leaving the country, in violation of the terms of his bail, according to the SBU.\n\nMedvedchuk was detained on April 12, Zelenskiy announced that day. Zelenskiy immediately posted pictures of him handcuffed, in Ukrainian military fatigues and looking bedraggled. Medvedchuk has since been in detention.\n\nMedvedchuk has denied the treason charges, saying they were falsified and part of a political plot against him. Kremlin spokesman Peskov told reporters on April 13 Medvedchuk had no back-channel communication with the Russian leadership.\n\nLutsenko, the former Ukraine prosecutor general, told Reuters that before the Russian invasion, Medvedchuk used an encrypted telephone that was issued to him by the Kremlin, equipment reserved only for the most senior Russian officials and pro-Russian separatist leaders. Lutsenko said Ukrainian investigators had managed to hack the encrypted phone system, without disclosing what they found.\n\nMedvedchuk\u2019s lawyer, Tetyana Zhukovska, declined to comment until a court has handed down a decision in the case. The Ukrainian prosecutor\u2019s office did not comment.\n\n\nOLEG TSARYOV\nHOTELIER\n\nEarly on Feb. 24, Tsaryov announced on social media he had crossed into Kyiv-controlled territory. \u201cKyiv will be free from fascists.\u201d Three sources familiar with Russia\u2019s plans said Kremlin planners picked Tsaryov to lead an interim puppet government. Tsaryov says Reuters\u2019 account of the overall operation \u201chas very little to do with reality.\u201d\n\nAnother key figure, according to three sources familiar with the Russian plans, was Oleg Tsaryov, a square-jawed 52-year-old former member of Ukraine\u2019s parliament. He was picked by Kremlin invasion planners to lead the new interim government they planned to install, these sources said. Their comments are the first confirmation from within Russia of U.S. intelligence assessments, reported by the Financial Times earlier this year, that Moscow was considering putting Tsaryov in a leadership role in a puppet government in Kyiv.\n\nTsaryov has been under Ukrainian and U.S. sanctions since 2014, when, after a bid to win election as Ukrainian president collapsed, he headed up a body called \u201cNovorossiya,\u201d or New Russia. The group pushed the idea of turning southeastern Ukraine into a separate pro-Russian statelet. By the start of this year, he was in Russian-annexed Crimea, where he owns two hotels.\n\nIn the early hours of Feb. 24, at the start of the invasion, Tsaryov told his more than 200,000 Telegram followers he had crossed into Kyiv-controlled territory. \u201cI\u2019m in Ukraine. Kyiv will be free from fascists.\u201d\n\nBut Zelenskiy did not capitulate. Any expectations in Moscow that he would flee Kyiv or negotiate a deal that would cede to Russia's demands soon evaporated. In the weeks that followed, Ukrainian forces halted Russian troops' advance on Kyiv.\n\nTsaryov never made it to the capital. On June 10, he posted an advertisement to his Telegram followers for his seaside hotel in Crimea, where a one-night stay costs 1,500 roubles ($28) per person per night. Tsaryov is now spending his time in Crimea with visits to Moscow, according to his social media posts.\n\nPARANOIA AND MISTRUST\n\nRussia\u2019s campaign of infiltration did, however, stir suspicion and mistrust at some levels of the Ukrainian state, which hampered its ability to govern, especially in the first few days after the invasion.\n\nOne stark incident that fuelled the tensions in Kyiv\u2019s power corridors related to the death in early March of Denys Kirieiev, a former bank executive, several sources said. He was a member of the Ukrainian delegation that took part in short-lived talks with Russian negotiators on the Ukraine-Belarus border, starting on Feb. 28. A photograph showed Kirieiev sitting alongside Ukrainian officials at the negotiating table.\n\nAn advisor to the Zelenskiy administration said, in an online interview, that officers from the SBU shot Kirieiev while trying to arrest him as a Russian spy.\n\nBut Ukraine\u2019s Military Intelligence Agency said Kirieiev was its employee and intelligence officer, and that he died a hero while conducting an unspecified special assignment defending Ukraine. A source close to the Ukrainian military told Reuters that Kirieiev was indeed a spy working for Ukraine. He had access to the highest levels of the Russian leadership, this source said, and was feeding back valuable information on invasion plans and other matters to his handlers in Kyiv.\n\n\nIVAN BAKANOV\nFORMER HEAD OF SECURITY SERVICE OF UKRAINE\n\nOn July 17, in a video address to the nation, President Zelenskiy suspended Bakanov, whom he has known for years, citing the large number of SBU staff suspected of treason. Bakanov didn\u2019t respond to questions from Reuters.\n\nAmid the chaos early in the war, Bakanov, then the head of the SBU, left Kyiv for at least three days after the Russian invasion, according to three people in Ukrainian law enforcement. Two of these people said some SBU staff recounted they were unable to reach Bakanov for several days after Russia invaded. In suspending Bakanov on July 17, Zelenskiy cited an article in Ukraine\u2019s Armed Forces statute, under which servicemen can be relieved of their duties for improper conduct leading to casualties or a threat of casualties.\n\nBakanov and the SBU did not respond to Reuters\u2019 questions.\n\nZelenskiy, in his speech, stressed the toll Russian infiltration was taking on his embattled country by speaking of the numerous officials who have been accused of betraying Ukraine.\n\n\u201cSuch an array of crimes against the foundations of the national security of the state ... poses very serious questions to the relevant leaders,\u201d Zelenskiy said.\n\n\u201cEach of these questions will receive a proper answer.\u201d",

At the same time, sanctions have also been proven to be ineffective when it comes to influencing Cuba's political leadership and their stance towards the US in which case they can be considered a failure.\n\nThe usual back-and-forth in these arguments seems to be someone saying that sanctions only punish the sanctioned country's people and sometimes (like right now with Russia and the EU) also everyone else who had a standing relationships with the sanctioned country. Usually the pro-sanction crowd will then say that the discontent people will act, thus enacting change in the sanctioned country's political leadership, or at least influencing their domestic or foreign policy in a big way that benefits the country doing the sanctioning. It appears that this basically never happens. \n\nA quick look at countries sanctioned by the US points to this at least.

A lot of people are going to die,\u201d defense analyst Joshua Epstein of the Brookings Institution said today.</p>\n\n<p>He said the Army\u2019s own research suggested that up to half as many American and other troops in Saudi Arabia would be killed or wounded as Iraqi soldiers in any drive into Kuwait.</p>\n\n<p>Taking into account data from past wars and the composition of forces facing each other in the Gulf, DuPuy reckons that 16% to 17% of American casualties would be fatalities--160 to 170 a day.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dupuyinstitute.org/blog/2016/05/17/assessing-the-1990-1991-gulf-war-forecasts/\">Here&#39;s some more</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>that the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff and the National Security Council estimated that the United States would lose between 20,000 and 30,000 dead and wounded soldiers in a Gulf war</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War\">Actual K:D ratio was 100:1 not 2:1, and only half the casualties were from enemy action</a>. US had zero clue just how good it is.</p>\n</div>",

Declaring a blockade is a strong provocation which would demand an equally strong response, and one which delegitimizes the blockade and neutralizes it as a policy. Or else this just becomes an American weakness. In other navigation crises with Russia, China, and Iran the US has put its ships directly into harms way to delegitimize territorial claims.

The first two options would weaken the regime, who staked itself on a policy it proved it couldn\u2019t defend. The third would require war. So China would pick war, because while they would hope for a US capitulation they would have to reasonably expect war. That is both sides would at that point have a greater incentive to act than talk, and neither would have room to back down or deescalate. \n\nThis discussion is analogous to the no-fly zone in Ukraine.
