But this year\u2019s annual gathering of brains in Kyiv had a decidedly Ukrainian twist \u2014 the innovations on exhibit were for war.\n\n>A maker of attack drones was diversifying to unmanned ground combat vehicles. From the Academy of Sciences came a prototype underwater robot for finding and collecting submerged land mines. One startup was developing low-cost combat communications; another, a web-based test to find warning signs of post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.\n\n>In the 18 months since Russia\u2019s invasion, Ukraine\u2019s resilience with the help of mainly NATO-member weaponry has come to define the war. Less noticed is a cottage industry of battlefield gadgetry that\u2019s starting to bear fruit.\n\n> To package everything in one place, Ukraine\u2019s government in April started an incubator for all forms of military innovation, called Brave 1. Organizers say they\u2019ve registered about 400 projects in four months, and Ukraine\u2019s armed forces have so far vetted 186 as potentially useful. Sixty are in robotics, more than 25 in AI, and 70 are for unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs.\n\n> \u201cOur task is to develop military technologies in Ukraine,\u201d said Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine\u2019s minister for digital transformation, who described Brave 1 as the institutionalization of his Army of Drones program. Success ultimately will be judged on how many projects get state contracts, he said.\n\n>There are plenty of contenders. Some are adapting existing kit, others are making cheaper versions of Western equipment Ukraine can\u2019t afford, and others again just respond to feedback from friends on the battlefield.\n\n>Take Himera Tech. It set out to build affordable, jam-resistant radio handsets shortly after Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s forces attacked in February 2022. It took until April this year for the first units to roll off their production line and about 600 are now in use at the front, according to co-founder Misha Rudominski. The company registered with Brave 1 in May.\n\n>The trick to building cheaper is the software the company developed to maximize performance in commercially available chips, Rudominski said. Radio sets made with military grade chips are more secure, but also cost thousands of dollars apiece. With as many as 250,000 combat soldiers to equip, that\u2019s a bill Ukraine can\u2019t foot.\n\n> \u201cWe wanted to build a solution that is just good enough,\u201d Rudominski said at his stall at June\u2019s Inscience conference in Kyiv. \u201cThis wouldn\u2019t defeat US or Chinese electronic warfare systems, but it doesn\u2019t need to. We\u2019re fighting the Russians.\u201d\n\n>Himera Tech expects to produce 2,000-3,000 units per month by the end of the year. It isn\u2019t yet selling to the Ukrainian Defense Ministry, but that\u2019s the aim and the company reckons it could then scale to 10,000 units per month. A model that can compete with military grade kit is in development, according to Rudominski. \n\n>Another Kyiv-based outfit, Power Kit, uses discarded electronic cigarettes to make power banks. Ivan Volynets, who founded the nonprofit together with five other IT specialists, described how in the first days of the Russian invasion they asked friends on the front line what they needed. The answers boiled down to night vision, power banks and weapons.\n\n> They made a night vision device paired with its own power bank and took it to the defense ministry. To their surprise, it was the power bank the army wanted, because they charge all the electronics front-line soldiers rely on, including night-vision gear, drones and communications.\n\n\n> The first Power Kit emerged in May 2022, built in the kitchen of the hotel the team were staying at in Lviv, western Ukraine, said Volynets, 30. They\u2019ve since made more than 2,100 at a cost of about $15 each and distribute them free of charge to soldiers.\n\n> Yevhenii Rvachov was IT specialist working with civilian drones in the northern city of Kharkiv before the invasion. He too consulted with soldiers after co-founding a company, Skylab UA, to make a bomb-dropping quadrocopter \u2014 a drone with four rotors \u2014 in April last year.\n\n> They told him they needed ground robots to make supplying forward positions less dangerous. So Skylab built the Sirko-S, a remote-controlled go-cart-like carrier with thermal cameras that can be used to bring up supplies or evacuate wounded. They\u2019ll cost of $8,000-$10,000 each.\n\n>The company\u2019s $5,000 \u201cJohnny\u201d is a shoe-box-size version, with a view to forward surveillance, kamikaze bombing runs or to help emergency services find survivors in collapsed buildings, according to Rvachov. All three products are registered with Brave 1, with grants approved, according to the organizers. Ten quadrocopters are in action at the front.\n\n>Close to the Polish border, a company called Citius-S is converting six-wheel drive cargo trucks into armored vehicles for clearing land mines and unexploded ordinance. The State Emergency Service of Ukraine saw the prototype in action last month and ordered 33 units, according to the company.\n\n> For underwater mines, the Institute for Problems of Artificial Intelligence at Ukraine\u2019s Academy of Sciences is developing a submersible device to find and retrieve ordinance left behind by the Russians. A prototype of the cuboid robot just began tests of its electronic systems, according to Sergii Simchenko, a PhD candidate in physics and math at the institute, who is working on the project.\n\n> Not every innovation or adaptation is about weapons, though. The Bohun amphibious all-terrain vehicle has huge tires with fin-like tread to climb over fallen trees or cross lakes and rivers. It was designed for Ukraine\u2019s hunters and fishermen, and since the Russian invasion a number were adapted for military use and sent to the front.\n\n>But in June, six of the newer Bohun-2 model also were converted to help evacuate victims of the flooding around the city of Kherson that followed destruction of a dam on Ukraine\u2019s massive Dnipro River. Lights and loudhailers were added outside the cabins, as well as extra batteries, removable seats and helicopter-ready metal stretchers inside.\n\n> Back at the Inscience conference, Sergiy Danylov was showing off the software his team at Anima have created. It uses an image-based test to measure levels of depression and anxiety with a web cam that follows eye movement to add objectivity.\n\n>The test involves looking at a series of trigger images, such as snakes, spiders and mutilated corpses, in each case on a split screen with more emotionally neutral options opposite. The key lies in how subjects respond, with some looking away to avoid the danger signals and others unable to take their eyes off them.\n\nGreat reporting by the FT on this as well:\n\n>[Ukraine\u2019s tech sector goes to war](https://youtu.be/voPCPhzmL10)",

I will say that at least for now, the balance of fires has tipped dramatically in Ukraine's favor over time (though its still stacked strongly in Russia's favor). As far as longterm sustainability goes, I'm actually fairly bullish on Ukrainian prospects: they're producing ammunition domestically (likely in small batches but still, better than nothing), several Eastern European countries have significantly increased production of Soviet/Russian caliber munitions for Ukraine, European ammunition production is *finally* starting to ramp up after a ridiculously slow start, US production is climbing steadily (though still too slowly), and Western-aligned states like South Korea have started (indirectly) providing munitions. \n\nConversely, Russia will be constrained in its own ability to produce munitions which is far below demand, while it might be able to source some munitions from countries like North Korea and Iran, they're likely to be rather limited in quantity (and potentially quality). The biggest asterix in my mind is China, if they decide to provide material support to the Russian war effort, that will likely singlehandedly be enough to give Russia a longterm edge.",

Early Tuesday, the Ukrainians assaulted the village from four directions. The team that attacked from the north advanced furthest, to the village cemetery, after overcoming a machine-gunner in the first house who was killed with an explosives-laden drone.\n\nHere's the claim about having taken at least part of the cemetery.\n\n>The Russians counterattacked with armored vehicles, grenades and mortars. As evening fell, Skala\u2019s men needed reinforcements. Skala called commanders in brigades nearby. They mustered volunteers: a handful from one brigade, a dozen from another and more than 20 from a third.\n\nThis part seems bizarre to me. Is this common? Asking for volunteers to go save a unit pinned down, rather than requesting reinforcements from commanders who order a unit to go in?\n\n>As Skala sketched out on a map how the teams should enter the village, one of his men spotted a Russian 120 mm mortar on its western edge. Skala gave the location to another commander by phone.

Iran\u2019s state-run media said four US citizens will be released in exchange for four or more unidentified Iranians detained in the US and only after the $6 billion in funds that are blocked in South Korea are transferred into an account in Qatar.\n\n>US officials declined to describe the terms of the deal, saying that revealing more risked upsetting a delicate process that could still fall apart. Yet their reticence also appeared intended to head off the inevitable criticism from Republicans and others that President Joe Biden was giving up too much to the regime in Tehran.\n\n>The US State Department has spoken to the Americans, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, describing the transfer as a \u201cpositive step.\u201d He added that he wouldn\u2019t \u201cget into any of the details about what we\u2019re doing or engaged on because I don\u2019t want to jeopardize the completion of this process.\u201d\n\n>But Iran\u2019s semi-official Tasnim news agency gave more details, saying the Americans would be freed only once Iran gets the $6 billion. It said the Iranians to be released were being held by the US for sanctions violations and described it as a direct quid pro quo.\n\n>A person briefed on the agreement, who asked not to be identified discussing terms that haven\u2019t been disclosed, said the US requested on Thursday that the money be transferred from South Korea to Switzerland and then to Qatar, which will oversee how it\u2019s spent. The prisoners will be swapped only after the transfer is complete, a process that should take 30 to 45 days, the person said.\n\n>>Secretive Diplomacy\n\n>The releases were the latest step in tentative and secretive diplomacy that\u2019s seen the US and Iran inch toward an informal understanding under which Tehran would free the Americans and potentially impose limits on its nuclear program.\n\n>The Swiss government, which represents US interests in Tehran in the absence of formal diplomatic relations, served as an intermediary, according to the person, who also credited Qatar and Oman with helping facilitate the process.\n\n>Those negotiations \u2014 conducted through intermediaries in Oman and elsewhere \u2014 led to an initial understanding for Iran to free prisoners while the US would allow for the release of the more than $6 billion in frozen funds that South Korea owes to Iran for oil purchases, Bloomberg News reported previously. Iran would be able to use those funds only for humanitarian purposes such as food and medicine.\n\n>As far back as March, Iran\u2019s foreign affairs minister Hossein Amirabdollahian said Iran and the US were preparing to carry out a prisoner exchange. Then-State Department spokesman Ned Price called that claim a \u201ccruel lie.\u201d\n\n>All along, US officials have been cagey about the terms of the deal, wary of acknowledging talks with a regime that has ramped up human rights abuses and continues to supply weapons and other material to Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. At the same time, Biden and his top officials say former President Donald Trump made a grave error in 2018 when he backed out of deal, signed in 2015, that imposed limits on Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\n>Trump\u2019s team, led by Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, launched a \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign designed to crush the country\u2019s economy and its nuclear ambitions. In the years since, Iran has pressed ahead, enriching uranium close to the levels needed for nuclear weapons. The country denies it wants a nuclear bomb.\n\n>Any deal will raise criticism from Biden\u2019s opponents, who hammered the Obama administration over the terms of the previous nuclear deal. In 2016, the US airlifted $400 million to Iran as it released four detained Americans. President Barack Obama said the payment wasn\u2019t a ransom and was from a decades-old dispute.\n\n>\u201cYou get what you pay for, as the saying goes,\u201d Robert Greenway, a senior National Security Council director under Trump, said of the latest developments in a social media post on Thursday. \u201cWhile it\u2019s encouraging to see the unjustly detained return home to families, rewarding horrific behavior doesn\u2019t work any better with rogue regimes than it does with pets.\u201d\n\n>Iran has made tentative steps toward trying to ease tensions in the region with an agreement to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia and further cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency. With a new nuclear deal politically unpalatable in the US, Western diplomats have been pushing Iran to voluntarily limit its uranium-enrichment levels and bolster its cooperation with international monitors in return for allowances to ship more crude.\n\n>On Thursday, National Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson, called the releases from prison an encouraging step but said the Americans \u201cshould have never been detained in the first place.\u201d State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said they \u201cmust be allowed to depart Iran and reunite with their loved ones as soon as possible.\u201d\n\n\nAs a reminder, since there was some disinformation on this the other day, reporting from a [month](https://apnews.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-intelligence-b506d130e474c00f6bd653d3d5a8d31a#:~:text=US%20intelligence%20assessment%20says%20Iran%20not%20currently%20developing%20nuclear%20weapons,-FILE%20%2D%20In%20this&text=WASHINGTON%20AP%20%E2%80%94%20A%20U.S.,could%20help%20it%20develop%20them.) ago:\n\n>\u201cIran is not currently undertaking the key nuclear weapons-development activities that would be necessary to produce a testable nuclear device,\u201d according to the two-page unclassified synopsis of the report.\n\n>However, Iran is also pursuing \u201cresearch and development activities that would bring it closer to producing the fissile material needed for completing a nuclear device following a decision to do so,\u201d the report said.\n\n>In that regard, Iran continues to violate the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal regarding uranium enrichment that it agreed to with world powers, the report said. The Trump administration withdrew from that agreement in 2018.\n\n>\u201cIran continues to increase the size and enrichment level of its uranium stockpile beyond JCPOA limits,\u201d the report said, adding that it also continues to exceed JCPOA restrictions on advanced centrifuge research and development.\n\n>These findings have been generally supported by inspections from the UN\u2019s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.\n\n>In addition to the nuclear findings, the U.S. intelligence report said that Iranian ballistic missile programs continue to pose a significant threat to countries around the Middle East. \u201cIran has emphasized improving the accuracy, lethality, and reliability of its missiles,\u201d it said.",

The person who filmed the video says that these guys have been laying out in the sun since 9am and the flight rescheduled for 8pm, with no food and little water, and no medical attention. These seem like seriously wounded soldiers too, which is why they're being airlifted to Moscow in the first place. \n\nThis tracks with everything we've heard about how bad medical care is for Russian soldiers, which provides yet more evidence supporting the estimates that the Russian WIA to KIA ratio is terrible, less than 3:1. Its genuinely crazy how bad Russian medical care is, and their lack of concern and care for their fellow countrymen is frankly appalling.",

        "body": "[Slow Counteroffensive darkens mood in Ukraine](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/08/10/ukraine-national-mood-counteroffensive-gloom/), from the Washington Post\n\n([Archive link to bypass paywall](https://archive.li/1evHw))\n\n> This nation is worn out.\n\n> For nearly 18 months, Ukraine has stood against its Russian invaders \u2014 rallying support for its troops by embracing last year\u2019s battlefield victories in the Kyiv, Kharkiv and Kherson regions.\nThose wins carried beleaguered Ukrainians through a winter of airstrikes on civilian infrastructure and a brutal and symbolic battle for Bakhmut, the eastern city that fell to the Russians in May.\nThroughout, Ukrainian officials and their western partners hyped up a coming counteroffensive \u2014 one that, buoyed by a flood of new weapons and training, they hoped would turn the tide of the war.\nBut two months after Ukraine went on the attack, with little visible progress on the front and a relentless, bloody summer across the country, the narrative of unity and endless perseverance has begun to fray.\n\n> The number of dead \u2014 untold thousands \u2014 increases daily. Millions are displaced and see no chance of returning home. In every corner of the country, civilians are exhausted from a spate of recent Russian attacks \u2014 including strikes on a historic cathedral in Odessa, a residential building in Kryvyi Rih and a blood transfusion center in the Kharkiv region.\nThis week, two Russian missiles hit a single block in the eastern town of Pokrovsk \u2014 where an evacuation train regularly picks up people fleeing front-line areas nearby \u2014 killing civilians and emergency workers who rushed there to save them.\nUkrainians, much in need of good news, are simply not getting any.\n\n> Music teacher Svitlana Zhdanova, 75, was sitting in her living room in Pokrovsk on Tuesday evening when the missiles rammed into her block, shattering all her glassware and breaking her piano. Not knowing where else to go, she cleaned up the apartment she has lived in since 1969 and decided to stay.\n\n> Raisa Rybalchenko, 78, lived on the fourth floor of a building badly damaged in the double strike. She was in the kitchen when the first blast hit. Soon after, five men banged on the door, shouting \u201cIs anyone alive?\u201d She called back that she was.\nOne of them carried her down the stairs. Soon after, the next strike hit. At least nine people have died so far, and dozens of others were wounded.\n\nBrief interjection to say: this sounds *very much* like an intentional double-tap strike on a civilian area to me.\n\n> On Wednesday, Rybalchenko was among the crowds of shocked people helping board up windows and sort through the remnants of their lives. She hopes the government will repair her apartment. \u201cBut right now, I don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t have any idea what is next. I\u2019m just in shock.\u201d\n\n> In Smila, a small city in central Ukraine, baker Alla Blyzniuk, 42, said she sells sweets for funeral receptions daily as parents prepare to bury their children killed on the front hundreds of miles away.\nBefore, she said, even when the situation was painful, \u201cpeople were united.\u201d They volunteered, made meals for one another and delivered food to soldiers. Now, she said, there\u2019s a sense of collective \u201cdisappointment.\u201d\n\n> Blyzniuk also lives in fear that her husband or two sons of fighting age will be mobilized. She has already noticed that far fewer men walk the streets of her city than before. Ukraine does not disclose its military casualty counts, but everyone shares stories, she said, of new soldiers at the front lasting just two to three days.\n\n> In the Donetsk region, an Estonian Ukrainian soldier who goes by the call sign Suzie works at a stabilization point where wounded soldiers are treated before being transferred to hospitals in safer towns. On a recent day, he helped organize body bags that would soon be used in the makeshift morgue that already reeked of death.\nSometimes, he said, soldiers\u2019 bodies are so blown apart they have to use two or three body bags to contain them. There are times when a soldier is returned with \u201cjust 15 percent of the body,\u201d Suzie said. \u201cI never saw so much blood before.\u201d\n\u201cIt is such a hard price for freedom,\u201d he added.\n\n> These scenes are unfolding a world away from Kyiv, the capital, where civilians \u2014 somewhat protected by strengthened air defenses \u2014 often hardly even react to air raid sirens. But even here, painful signs of the war lurk everywhere. On park benches, freshly wounded soldiers being treated in the capital sip coffee and smoke cigarettes before returning to their hospital beds. They watch as civilians stroll by, dogs and babies in tow.\n\n> Viktor, 34, a former restaurant waiter, is among them. He came under mortar attack in a trench on the front line in Zaporizhzhia last week. His wrist was split open and his face \u2014 now covered in scabs \u2014 was sprayed with shrapnel. His knee was also hit.\nNow, in Kyiv, he sees bars and restaurants are packed and the city hums with traffic. A group of children walked by, craning their necks to look at his injuries. Viktor, who asked that his last name not be disclosed for security reasons, considered himself lucky to at least be able to walk. Many other men in the same park are missing limbs, and Viktor\u2019s Facebook is flooded with photos of soldiers who did not make it home at all. The images haunt him so much he no longer likes to check his phone.\n\u201cIt\u2019s too depressing,\u201d he said. \n\n> The latest fight has been grueling. One day, it took his unit seven hours to move forward just 400 meters, he said \u2014 about a quarter of a mile. \u201cAnd that was quite fast.\u201d\nHe and his wife, who is also serving in the military, were due to see each other that afternoon for the first time since he was wounded. \u201cI\u2019ll probably cry,\u201d he said. Once he is healed, he said, he will go back to the front.\nRuslan Proektor, 52, lost his leg this summer when he stepped on a mine fighting in the east. He was immediately wounded again when the soldier trying to carry him to safety stepped on another. Now that he is recovering in Kyiv, his wife, Anna Oliinyk, 47, said she wants \u201cthe counteroffensive to be more active.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got all these guys coming back from the front line without limbs,\u201d she said, looking at her husband, who was in a wheelchair. \u201cI want the price they paid to be reasonable. Otherwise it\u2019s just useless, what they went through.\u201d\nGiven the choice now, Proektor said, he would not sign up again. \u201cThey are taking everyone and sending them to the front line without proper preparation,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be in the company of unmotivated people.\u201d\n\n> In Kryvyi Rih, doctor Valeriya Maslyanyk, 58, sighed as she looked up at her damaged apartment this week \u2014 just one entrance over from a section of the building destroyed in a strike last month. A gaping hole sits where her neighbors used to live. Outside, a pile of flowers and stuffed animals memorializes them.\nAlready thinking ahead to winter, she fears her windows will not be replaced by the time temperatures start to drop. She is tired and sees no end in sight. \u201cI want to go to the sea,\u201d she said wistfully. \u201cBut the Russians took all of our seas.\u201d\nAcross the street, construction worker Volodymyr Pravednyk, 46, stopped to observe the wreckage. His sister lives in the same apartment block but escaped unscathed.\nPravednyk said that he fears that the attack was \u201cjust the beginning\u201d of more strikes on this industrial city. He lives around the corner, and each time he passes the ruined building, he said, \u201cI feel sorrow for us Ukrainian civilians who have to suffer so much.\u201d\n\n*Very* depressing article from the Washington Post, focusing on the civilian situation. Also some interesting civilian stories, which is why I felt like sharing: I don't *like* sharing gloomy articles at all, and would rather be sharing upbeat ones, but unfortunately there's not as many of them as there used to be.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/08/10/ukraine-national-mood-counteroffensive-gloom/\">Slow Counteroffensive darkens mood in Ukraine</a>, from the Washington Post</p>\n\n<p>(<a href=\"https://archive.li/1evHw\">Archive link to bypass paywall</a>)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This nation is worn out.</p>\n\n<p>For nearly 18 months, Ukraine has stood against its Russian invaders \u2014 rallying support for its troops by embracing last year\u2019s battlefield victories in the Kyiv, Kharkiv and Kherson regions.\nThose wins carried beleaguered Ukrainians through a winter of airstrikes on civilian infrastructure and a brutal and symbolic battle for Bakhmut, the eastern city that fell to the Russians in May.\nThroughout, Ukrainian officials and their western partners hyped up a coming counteroffensive \u2014 one that, buoyed by a flood of new weapons and training, they hoped would turn the tide of the war.\nBut two months after Ukraine went on the attack, with little visible progress on the front and a relentless, bloody summer across the country, the narrative of unity and endless perseverance has begun to fray.</p>\n\n<p>The number of dead \u2014 untold thousands \u2014 increases daily. Millions are displaced and see no chance of returning home. In every corner of the country, civilians are exhausted from a spate of recent Russian attacks \u2014 including strikes on a historic cathedral in Odessa, a residential building in Kryvyi Rih and a blood transfusion center in the Kharkiv region.\nThis week, two Russian missiles hit a single block in the eastern town of Pokrovsk \u2014 where an evacuation train regularly picks up people fleeing front-line areas nearby \u2014 killing civilians and emergency workers who rushed there to save them.\nUkrainians, much in need of good news, are simply not getting any.</p>\n\n<p>Music teacher Svitlana Zhdanova, 75, was sitting in her living room in Pokrovsk on Tuesday evening when the missiles rammed into her block, shattering all her glassware and breaking her piano. Not knowing where else to go, she cleaned up the apartment she has lived in since 1969 and decided to stay.</p>\n\n<p>Raisa Rybalchenko, 78, lived on the fourth floor of a building badly damaged in the double strike. She was in the kitchen when the first blast hit. Soon after, five men banged on the door, shouting \u201cIs anyone alive?\u201d She called back that she was.\nOne of them carried her down the stairs. Soon after, the next strike hit. At least nine people have died so far, and dozens of others were wounded.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Brief interjection to say: this sounds <em>very much</em> like an intentional double-tap strike on a civilian area to me.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>On Wednesday, Rybalchenko was among the crowds of shocked people helping board up windows and sort through the remnants of their lives. She hopes the government will repair her apartment. \u201cBut right now, I don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t have any idea what is next. I\u2019m just in shock.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In Smila, a small city in central Ukraine, baker Alla Blyzniuk, 42, said she sells sweets for funeral receptions daily as parents prepare to bury their children killed on the front hundreds of miles away.\nBefore, she said, even when the situation was painful, \u201cpeople were united.\u201d They volunteered, made meals for one another and delivered food to soldiers. Now, she said, there\u2019s a sense of collective \u201cdisappointment.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Blyzniuk also lives in fear that her husband or two sons of fighting age will be mobilized. She has already noticed that far fewer men walk the streets of her city than before. Ukraine does not disclose its military casualty counts, but everyone shares stories, she said, of new soldiers at the front lasting just two to three days.</p>\n\n<p>In the Donetsk region, an Estonian Ukrainian soldier who goes by the call sign Suzie works at a stabilization point where wounded soldiers are treated before being transferred to hospitals in safer towns. On a recent day, he helped organize body bags that would soon be used in the makeshift morgue that already reeked of death.\nSometimes, he said, soldiers\u2019 bodies are so blown apart they have to use two or three body bags to contain them. There are times when a soldier is returned with \u201cjust 15 percent of the body,\u201d Suzie said. \u201cI never saw so much blood before.\u201d\n\u201cIt is such a hard price for freedom,\u201d he added.</p>\n\n<p>These scenes are unfolding a world away from Kyiv, the capital, where civilians \u2014 somewhat protected by strengthened air defenses \u2014 often hardly even react to air raid sirens. But even here, painful signs of the war lurk everywhere. On park benches, freshly wounded soldiers being treated in the capital sip coffee and smoke cigarettes before returning to their hospital beds. They watch as civilians stroll by, dogs and babies in tow.</p>\n\n<p>Viktor, 34, a former restaurant waiter, is among them. He came under mortar attack in a trench on the front line in Zaporizhzhia last week. His wrist was split open and his face \u2014 now covered in scabs \u2014 was sprayed with shrapnel. His knee was also hit.\nNow, in Kyiv, he sees bars and restaurants are packed and the city hums with traffic. A group of children walked by, craning their necks to look at his injuries. Viktor, who asked that his last name not be disclosed for security reasons, considered himself lucky to at least be able to walk. Many other men in the same park are missing limbs, and Viktor\u2019s Facebook is flooded with photos of soldiers who did not make it home at all. The images haunt him so much he no longer likes to check his phone.\n\u201cIt\u2019s too depressing,\u201d he said. </p>\n\n<p>The latest fight has been grueling. One day, it took his unit seven hours to move forward just 400 meters, he said \u2014 about a quarter of a mile. \u201cAnd that was quite fast.\u201d\nHe and his wife, who is also serving in the military, were due to see each other that afternoon for the first time since he was wounded. \u201cI\u2019ll probably cry,\u201d he said. Once he is healed, he said, he will go back to the front.\nRuslan Proektor, 52, lost his leg this summer when he stepped on a mine fighting in the east. He was immediately wounded again when the soldier trying to carry him to safety stepped on another. Now that he is recovering in Kyiv, his wife, Anna Oliinyk, 47, said she wants \u201cthe counteroffensive to be more active.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got all these guys coming back from the front line without limbs,\u201d she said, looking at her husband, who was in a wheelchair. \u201cI want the price they paid to be reasonable. Otherwise it\u2019s just useless, what they went through.\u201d\nGiven the choice now, Proektor said, he would not sign up again. \u201cThey are taking everyone and sending them to the front line without proper preparation,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be in the company of unmotivated people.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In Kryvyi Rih, doctor Valeriya Maslyanyk, 58, sighed as she looked up at her damaged apartment this week \u2014 just one entrance over from a section of the building destroyed in a strike last month. A gaping hole sits where her neighbors used to live. Outside, a pile of flowers and stuffed animals memorializes them.\nAlready thinking ahead to winter, she fears her windows will not be replaced by the time temperatures start to drop. She is tired and sees no end in sight. \u201cI want to go to the sea,\u201d she said wistfully. \u201cBut the Russians took all of our seas.\u201d\nAcross the street, construction worker Volodymyr Pravednyk, 46, stopped to observe the wreckage. His sister lives in the same apartment block but escaped unscathed.\nPravednyk said that he fears that the attack was \u201cjust the beginning\u201d of more strikes on this industrial city. He lives around the corner, and each time he passes the ruined building, he said, \u201cI feel sorrow for us Ukrainian civilians who have to suffer so much.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Very</em> depressing article from the Washington Post, focusing on the civilian situation. Also some interesting civilian stories, which is why I felt like sharing: I don&#39;t <em>like</em> sharing gloomy articles at all, and would rather be sharing upbeat ones, but unfortunately there&#39;s not as many of them as there used to be. I&#39;ve cut some out just to fit the word limit, would suggest reading it but I think I&#39;ve given the critical bits.</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s an image at the end I want to include for people who aren&#39;t going to click through.\n<a href=\"https://archive.li/1evHw/b6292e2e0a1a66a7b264309d30144085105e10e2.webp\">Ukrainian military helicopters fly over a field of sunflowers in Ukraine\u2019s Donetsk region on Wednesday.

                "body": "This isn't why the Soviets built carriers, their naval doctrine cut a different way in that any of it made sense (most of it didn't make sense). Soviet surface doctrine was designed to protect its coast from attack and to defend SSBNs from NATO attack. Insofar as airpower was required for any of this, land based aviation could help cover the coasts and could adequately protect surface ships doing ASW work. Helicopter and ASW assets could help secure the distant haunts of the Arctic patrols. \n\nThe rest of the Soviet fleet was *primarily* built to do two things. First to attack and kill American carriers, which were nuclear armed and capable of delivering devastating attacks against the Soviet mainland, and to wage some kind of vaugely annoying anti-shipping campaign in the Atlantic ala WWII. And the sub campaign was a distant fifth place behind one other thing I'll get to in a second. But this is why you see a large surface fleet with mostly carrier killer surface to surface missiles, along with a large and powerful submarine fleet. Though its worth noting that Tom Clancy really overblew the submarine threat. Admiral Gorshkov was popular in the west but was *not* popular in the USSR. Which is why he was popular in the west, if he was writing things of significance they would *not* have been published here. \n\nThe secret priority, more than trying to choke off commerce but less than killing carriers, was in the soft squishy world of peacetime prestige in the third World. The Soviet carrier program began under Stalin, primarily as a prestige thing versus the British. It was wisely canceled after his death due to the expense. But in the 1970s the prestige fleet was revived, this time fueled by revenue from the oil embargos of the 1970s. The Soviets built a large, powerful, visible fleet which could sail into the Atlantic, and particularly into the Indian, and challenge American influence there. They could port in friendly countries, show the flag, tell people in the event of a war the USSR had their back. The formation of an Indian Ocean fleet forced the US to reallocate assets away from more important areas. The carriers were another prestige item which said 'the Americans can, so can we.' It was all great fun. Its just it wasn't a serious wartime threat. Soviet forces stationed in the Indian, or transiting the central Atlantic, would have been badly cut off from friendly forces. Soviet carriers were woefully inadequate compared to Americans, and had nowhere to go. No mission to carry out. They would have done fuck all in the Arctic, fuck all in the Norwegian Sea, and would have been sunk in the North Atlantic outright. The entire Soviet surface fleet, the chunk of it not relegated to coastal duties, enjoyed the same conundrum. The had no purpose except CV hunting, and even then were likely ill-suited to the task. A much larger more powerful submarine fleet could have done what the Kuznetsovs would have realistically accomplished. But, highlight the \"influence\" of Adm Gorshkov, the USSR picked CVs. For the prestige mostly. \n\nThe Soviet Navy really was a joke, not a seriously threatening force. Their best assets, some legitimately very high quality submarines, were always too few, too badly maintained, to pose the kind of threat they'd need to to eject NATO from the Atlantic. And of course one wonders how big a deal the Atlantic convoys would have been in World War Three. If the Battle for Germany lasted only three weeks before victory or total annihilation, youre probably not bringing any useful amount of supplies over.",

It probably still can be used  as a defense asset at the entrance of harbours.\n\nOne thing that I did notice however is that in previous attacks, during daylight the Russians were able to mount a defense. As far as I could see, with deck mounted machine gun(s) rather than dedicated weapons of their ships.\n\nEither way, we haven't seen Russian ships using their dedicated weapons to engage those drones, but rather used machine guns operated by a crew member. Although, that itself cannot be used as a proof in general, it seems one (or many of) few things are happening.\n\nRadars (at least on those naval ships that got attacked) cannot reliably detect ua surface drones and provide firing solutions to their guns.

        "body": "[Russian convicts released to fight with Wagner accused of new crimes](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66364272)\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nA prisoner believed to have been released early to fight with Wagner mercenaries in Ukraine has been accused of committing a double murder in Russia after returning home from the war.\n\n\nDemyan Kevorkyan, who was given an 18-year prison sentence in 2016, has been arrested for killing a young man and woman on their way home from work.\nHe denies the accusation.\n\nThe BBC has learned he is not the only convict freed early to fight, pardoned and then accused of reoffending.\n\nWe have confirmed that suspects in about 20 serious offences, including rape and murder, are fighters recruited by the Wagner mercenary group in prison and released early to serve in Ukraine.\n\nKevorkyan was one of 150 prisoners recruited on 31 August 2022 when the head of Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, visited his prison, according to a former inmate quoted on a social media channel.\n\nThe BBC has been told that Kevorkyan was later spotted back in his home village of Pridorozhnaya in Krasnodar, south-west Russia telling people he had just returned from the battlefields of Ukraine.\n\nOne of the people he is accused of killing is 19-year-old Tatyana Mostyko, a children's entertainer. Her mother Nadezhda shows us a video of Tatyana in a pink and blue jumpsuit, dancing and organising games at a party.\n\n\"She loved that work,\" says Nadezhda. \"When she came back from a job, she'd laugh about what they'd been doing, how she amused them.\"\n\nBut the last job Tatyana did was on 28 April. Her boss Kirill Chubko was driving her home when they got a puncture and pulled over on to the side of a road near the town of Berezanskaya, in south-west Russia. Kirill's wife Darya told local media he called her to say he'd be late, but not to worry as a group of young people had stopped to help them. That was the last time she heard his voice.\n\nBy morning, the pair were still not home. Sensing something was wrong, a worried Darya called the police.\n\nHundreds of people helped search remote countryside and Tatyana's mother began a six-hour journey to the area, catching a plane and train from her small village in Siberia, in eastern Russia.\n\n\"The worst thing was when we landed and I switched my phone back on. There were endless messages,\" says Nadezhda. \"You can't imagine how I panicked. I hurled the phone away, because they could only mean one thing - that it was all over. It was animal fear. I can't describe it.\"\n\nThree suspects were arrested, including 31-year-old Kevorkyan. The other two, Anatoly Dvoynikov and Aram Tatosyan, led detectives to makeshift graves in woodland not far from Kirill's burned-out car. Kirill and Tatyana had been stabbed and police said that the young woman showed \"signs of a violent death\".\n\nDvoynikov and Tatosyan confessed to robbery and murder and said Kevorkyan was in charge, although Kevorkyan denies any involvement.\n\nNadezhda could not believe Kevorkyan was a free man, having been sentenced to 18 years in prison for an eerily similar crime before. \"He shouldn't have got out before 2028,\" she says.\nKevorkyan was convicted of running a gang that had hijacked a car not far from where Tatyana and Kirill were murdered. They robbed the people inside and shot one of them dead.\n\n\n\"On what legitimate basis was he released?\" asks Nadezhda. Under Russian law, inmates should serve at least two-thirds of their sentence. \"He should have served at least 12 years. He served only six,\" she says, as she struggles to come to terms with the thought that Tatyana's brutal murder could have been avoided.\n\nA video of Prigozhin at a Russian jail shows him telling rows of prisoners lined up in identical black fur hats that he prefers convicts who have murdered more than once and offenders who have beaten up a state official or policeman.\n\n\"We need your criminal talents,\" he says, warning them that 10% to 15% would return from Ukraine \"in zinc coffins\".\n\nBut he promised the ones who survived six months on the front line could go home with a bonus of 100,000 roubles ($1,000; \u00a3800) and, crucially, a pardon.\nIn June 2023, President Putin confirmed publicly for the first time he had been signing presidential pardons for prisoners who had returned from the Ukraine war.\n\nPrigozhin says that over the course of a year, Wagner recruited 49,000 prisoners to fight and only 32,000 returned. That's a much lower proportion than he originally promised. But independent researchers believe the real number of survivors is even lower, about 20,000.\nIn a video in January welcoming ex-convicts home, Prigozhin tells them: \"You were an offender, as they say - now you're a war hero!\"\n\nBut more of these \"heroes\" have been accused of crimes - the BBC has identified about 20 cases involving serious offences.\n\nPrigozhin has claimed that the reoffending rate among ex-Wagner recruits is 10% to 20% lower than the average for released criminals.\n\n**But the director of the prisoners' rights organisation Russia Behind Bars, Olga Romanova, says the real number may be much greater because many crimes are not recorded.**\n\nShe thinks this might be because a new law criminalises anyone who discredits people who have fought in the so-called \"special military operation\".\n\nThe families of other victims are also worried about ex-convicts coming home, not only unpunished but further brutalised by their experiences on the front line.\n\nOksana Pekhteleva's 23-year-old daughter Vera was stabbed more than 100 times, then strangled with an electric cable in an attack so violent it made headlines across Russia.\n\nIn July 2022 Vera's former boyfriend, Vladislav Kanius, was sentenced to 17 years in a penal colony for her murder. Less than a year later, it didn't occur to Oksana that he could be anywhere else. But she was wrong.\n\nPhotos of him started to appear on social media in May. He was holding a gun and wearing military uniform. To start with Oksana presumed they were fake.\n\nBut a month later she received official confirmation that Kanius had been transferred to a prison in Rostov in southern Russia, a place widely believed to be a staging point for Russian prisoners who volunteered to fight in Ukraine.\n\nWhen Oksana asked the court to tell her where Kanius was they told her they were unable to find him and his location was a state secret. Given his last known location and the photos in military uniform, she thinks it is likely that he is fighting in Ukraine and if he survives will be given an official pardon and be able to return to civilian life a free man.\n\nFor a mother who spent months battling for justice for her daughter, it's a bitter blow. \"This is blasphemy,\" she says. \"It's like all of us have been assaulted. This is a signal to all scum out there: 'Do whatever you want, you won't be punished.'\"\n\nMany lawyers told us they are powerless to intervene - a person can't be tried twice for the same offence and the only way they can be sent back to prison is if they offend again.\nThis is leaving relatives of murder victims, such as Tatyana's mother, Nadezhda, terrified. The most she feels she can do is support a petition that's already gained tens of thousands of signatures to demand Kevorkyan - the chief suspect of her daughter's murder - gets a life sentence, if convicted.\n\n\"I never talk about this at home... Tatyana was taken away from me and the ground has gone from under my feet,\" she says, fighting back the tears.\n\"Of course, I understand who was responsible for my daughter's death and I know it wasn't his first offence... It's hard for me... But I'm not stupid. I understand they won't put him away for life.\"",

We gave the ANSF training and equipment, and it ended up yielding nothing. Billions of dollars in Western gear is now happily being used by Islamic extremists to secure their stranglehold on the country and threaten their neighbors.

The possibility of Leopards and Abrams ending up on the Black Market was something to consider.\n\nCertainly for the first half a year of war, there was nothing to indicate Russia would ever be driven out of the territory it had taken in the East. After Russia's bizarre victory march to Kyiv was turned back, Ukraine steadily lost territory and men at a frightening pace. Mariupol fell, the Popasna breakout happened, Severodonetsk and Lysychansk fell, the latter with hardly a fight. It was bleak. So we sent them ancient towed artillery pieces with the firing computer removed, Stingers and Javelins, old Soviet equipment, etc mainly as defensive tools to prevent further losses. If those wound up on the Black Market, then so be it. At least it wouldn't be modern-ish Western gear. The only real risk we took was sending HIMARS, which proved to be the closest thing this war has had to a true wunderwaffe. And even still, we only sent short range missiles. Nothing Russia couldn't replicate in the future, nothing China can't do.\n\nBut I think Kharkiv and Kherson shocked the West. We started thinking they actually had a shot at this, that Russia hadn't committed fully and could be driven back. The risk of Black Market sales turned out to be much lower than we thought.

The West began its deliberations on who would supply what. No one wanted to lead. No one wanted to be the country that overcommitted while the others could enjoy their Peace Dividend. Negotiations were long and slow, but eventually, it started coming together. Britain would send tanks, so now the others wanted to send tanks. But no one wanted to send *a lot* of tanks. Same with artillery, same with IFVs. A plan emerged to train the Ukrainians on combined arms, but no one wanted to slow down training of their own forces, and Ukraine didn't want to spare veterans for training since they were more useful dying in Bakhmut apparently. No one authorized the trainers to divert from official training guides. No one trained the trainers on the peculiarities of the Ukrainian battlefield.\n\nAnd so we get this. Piecemeal training and piecemeal equipment deliveries, all because the West honestly never thought Ukraine would get this far and we all collectively suck at moving quickly or being adaptable or coming up with a unified plan.",

Of course Putin doesn&#39;t feel significant pressure to end the war now, <em>he still believes he can eke out a win</em>. The nuance here is that a major defeat in Ukraine will be terminal for Putin&#39;s regime (hence Putin&#39;s decision to enact mobilization). You don&#39;t end a war if you think you can still gain more..</p>\n</div>",

Against the Russians at Riga in 1917 they made an assault river crossing against 3:1 odds look like a walk in the park. But their decision to use that skill in France in spring 1918 in the way they did was probably determined by material conditions. Despite significant creativity, substitutions, and more than a bit of vulgar pillaging, after 4 years of blockade Germany's economic situation was critical. Some estimates suggest the average German was living on just 1,000 calories a day in 1918. Juxtaposed with the failed U-Boat campaign and the resultant stream of enthusiastic American manpower and materiel arriving in France, this drove the decision to make a move before it was too late.\n\nThe Germans' military skills were certainly sharp after a winter of training and this was accentuated by the spirits of troops fresh from victory in Russia. Their 1918 offensive did actually succeed in capturing enemy rear areas and breaking out into open country for the first time in France since 1914. However, the Entente established new defenses and ultimately the operation failed. Both sides suffered more than 500 thousand casualties with Germany's compensation being about a thousand captured artillery pieces and a 40 mile salient.\n\nWhy the failure? Quite possibly because many soldiers wandered off to loot French houses and the resulting realization that the enemy's material conditions were not at all like their own. From this point surrender or desertion by German soldiers became increasingly common.\n\nThough Germany's strength continued to increase in France on paper for a while that all changed with the Entente's counter-offensive. No doubt the quality of the attacks played a part - the Entente of 1918 was much more skillful than the Entente of 1915, and the correlation of [German strength in France with the start of the Entente offensive in August is clearly visible](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Riflemen-1918-Western-Front.jpg). Over the next 100 days the Entente would also advance about 50 miles. But consider that success in light of the material situation: hundreds of thousands of enthusiastic American troops could take over some of the hottest fighting from their beleaguered allies, and they were all fighting against a demoralized enemy whose best soldiers had been spent on a failed offensive and whose home front was brewing a communist revolution as an alternative to literal starvation.\n\nCould the Entente of 1915 survive Operation Michael, or fight well enough to grab Germany by the neck with both hands and throttle them for a hundred consecutive days? Maybe, maybe not. But, regardless of the role military skill played in sticking the landing on the battlefield, the actual decisions being made - the action, reaction, and capitulation that ended the war - seem to have been driven by the relative exhaustion of the combatants. On paper the Entente planned to keep fighting Germany for another year, in practice they didn't have to because Germany ran out of food and prospects for victory and gave up so they could recall their soldiers to put down a revolution.\n\n> Is it useful to draw parallels to this to predict the outcome of the current war?\n\nHard to say. There are plenty of modern wars where periods of attrition enabled periods of dynamic movement. The Normandy breakout, for example. Sanctions and Black Sea shipping attacks are nowhere near the magnitude of the WWI blockade or U-Boat war.

Russia has certainly lost a lot of material but this doesn't seem to be producing waves of surrenders or desertions.\n\nOne parallel specific to WWI that might make sense is to look at the character of a successful \"slow push\" in trench warfare conditions.

He categorically replied in the negative and said that it was due to the Prime Minister\u2019s visit to Moscow. He said that \u201cI think if the no-confidence vote against the Prime Minister succeeds, all will be forgiven in Washington because the Russia visit is being looked at as a decision by the Prime Minister. Otherwise, I think it will be tough going ahead.\u201d He paused and then said \u201cI cannot tell how this will be seen by Europe but I suspect their reaction will be similar.\u201d He then said that \u201chonestly I think isolation of the Prime Minister will become very strong from Europe and the United States.\u201d Don further commented that it seemed that the Prime Minister\u2019s visit to Moscow was planned during the Beijing Olympics and there was an attempt by the Prime Minister to meet Putin which was not successful and then this idea was hatched that he would go to Moscow.\n\nFrom what I understand, the \"cipher\" Imran Khan references several times over the past year is the cable itself, and it *seems* like he actually read the cipher/cable, and it wasn't simply described to him. [This is how Khan describes](https://theintercept.com/2023/06/05/imran-khan-interview/) what occurred in the meeting months before the Intercept obtained the cipher/cable:\n\n> On the 6th of March 2022, there was a meeting between the Pakistani ambassador and the U.S. Under Secretary of State Don Lu. In that meeting, the meeting was recorded, and a cipher was sent to the Foreign Office and me. In the cipher, it said that Donald Lu [was] telling the ambassador that Imran Khan had to be removed as prime minister in a vote of no confidence; otherwise, there will be consequences to Pakistan. The next day, 7th of March, was the vote of no confidence. So at the time, I thought it was really a U.S.-led conspiracy. Already, the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan was meeting those people who then defected from my party. So the U.S. Embassy was already meeting these people, the ones who jumped ship first. And then the moment the vote of no confidence came, then there were about 20 people who deserted my party, and the government fell.\n\n> At the time, I thought it was U.S.-led. Later on, I discovered that it was the army chief, who actually fed the U.S. \u2014 he had a lobbyist in the U.S. called [former Pakistan ambassador to the U.S.] Husain Haqqani, hired by my government without me knowing it, who was actually telling the U.S. that I, Imran Khan, was anti-American and actually, the army chief was pro-American. [Haqqani told The Intercept and other news outlets that Khan\u2019s claim is false.] So later on, we discovered that it was actually engineered from here because I had a perfectly good relationship with the Trump administration. So I couldn\u2019t work out what had gone wrong. But then we discovered that it was the army chief who actually engineered this feeling that I was anti-American, in the U.S.\n\n[The lettergate article on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-confidence_motion_against_Imran_Khan?useskin=vector#Allegation_of_foreign_support_for_the_motion) has some additional context.\n\nI'm curious what Asad Majeed Khan actually did after this meeting. How many people in the parliamentary no-confidence motion actually voted based on the message conveyed in this meeting (or elsewhere?). When Donald Lu mentions \"tough going ahead\" what exactly does that mean? The Intercept claims that \"the remarks appear to have been taken as a signal for the Pakistani military to act.\" And a question for y'all: do you think Lu should have expressed an opinion on the no-confidence vote, highlighting the preference of the US?\n\nEdit: Also, while this is ultimately unknowable, I would love to know what the *intent* of Lu was. There is a conspiracy here that really needs more evidence than the above: did the White House/State Department *tell* Lu that he needed to express an opinion on the no-confidence vote and give enough \"subtle\", implicit threats such that the Pakistani military would \"get the message\" and act accordingly? There's been a lot of attention on what this cable supposedly uncovers, but apart from a few lines the majority of the meeting described seems to be just centered on the US outlining their criticisms of Pakistan's policy at the time wrt Ukraine and Russia. Likewise, Asad Majeed Khan also outlined some criticisms of US policy. It just seems like standard diplomatic talk for these particular segments.",

As I mentioned in the initial post:\n\n> This is the most \"scandalous\" paragraph and where people have interpreted there being a strong implicit threat [...] There's been a lot of attention on what this cable supposedly uncovers, but apart from a few lines the majority of the meeting described seems to be just centered on the US outlining their criticisms of Pakistan's policy at the time wrt Ukraine and Russia. \n\nThe majority of what the cable outlines falls under point number one above, and I didn't express disapproval of those portions (but the polices itself are possibly questionable). The \"scandalous\" portion of the cable does not fall under point number one or two above, but it occupies the \"grey area\" in between. Threats aren't inherently immoral, and depending on the policy we might even justify the threat. However, let's say Donald Lu said the following: \"Hey, the US despises Khan and that no-confidence vote against Imran Khan better fucking succeed or we will put Pakistan through the grinder, and our European friends will back us up. Make sure the military gets this message because we're not playing around and we know they run things over there.\" Most people would agree that this crosses a \"line\" in terms of how a state ought to behave via their diplomats, ambassadors, etc. Now, hypothetically, what if you conveyed the exact same message in a far more *sanitized, subtle, and implicit* manner? Would we still approve of the behaviour if there was this veneer of civility that the rhetoric was wrapped in? Would we still approve of the behaviour if it was exhibited by some other state towards the US or some EU country? What is the acceptable level of \"interference\" or \"involvement\" in the domestic affairs of another country and how can we maintain consistency in terms of how we act? In a country like *Pakistan*, where the army chiefs wield far more power than would ever be appropriate in your typical, Western liberal democracy; where the populist sentiment of there being a \"deep state\" has some merit; where a delicate process surrounding a potential motion of no confidence is underway that does not have popular support from the electorate; should the US be more careful and reserved about making direct comments on the no-confidence vote? \n\nAnd the reason why I speak in terms of hypotheticals here is because ultimately we don't have access to all the information that we would like, and it's debatable the extent to which we need to \"read between the lines\" of various statements, but there are intriguing matters to explore if we set up specific scenarios. Somewhat disappointingly, there seems to be a heavy focus on the least interesting part of this entire matter: the conspiracy, which I already acknowledged doesn't have much evidentiary basis. There's far more interesting, nuanced conversations to be had, but, predictably, there's a bit of a partisan split going on here where leftists are focused on the alleged \"imperialism\", \"US regime change\", etc., and liberals are just focused on rebutting these claims while not entertaining the notion that that the US could possibly be doing anything unseemly here. If anything, the optics are truly dreadful here, and the US ought to ensure -- wherever reasonable -- that there isn't a perception that they were involved in regime change, making efforts to restore their bad reputation wherever possible and maintain the soft power they wield.",
