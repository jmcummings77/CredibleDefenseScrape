This report seeks to outline how Russian forces have adapted their tactics in the Ukrainian conflict and the challenges this has created for the Ukrainian military that must be overcome. The report examines Russian military adaptation by combat function.\n\n>Russian infantry tactics have shifted from trying to deploy uniform Battalion Tactical Groups as combined arms units of action to a stratified division by function into line, assault, specialised and disposable troops. These are formed into task-organised groupings. Line infantry are largely used for ground holding and defensive operations. Disposable infantry are used for continuous skirmishing to either identify Ukrainian firing positions, which are then targeted by specialised infantry, or to find weak points in Ukrainian defences to be prioritised for assault. Casualties are very unevenly distributed across these functions. The foremost weakness across Russian infantry units is low morale, which leads to poor unit cohesion and inter-unit cooperation.\n\n>Russian engineering has proven to be one of the stronger branches of the Russian military. Russian engineers have been constructing complex obstacles and field fortifications across the front. This includes concrete reinforced trenches and command bunkers, wire-entanglements, hedgehogs, anti-tank ditches, and complex minefields. Russian mine laying is extensive and mixes anti-tank and victim-initiated anti-personnel mines, the latter frequently being laid with multiple initiation mechanisms to complicate breaching. These defences pose a major tactical challenge to Ukrainian offensive operations.\n\n>Russian armour is rarely used for attempts at breakthrough. Instead, armour is largely employed in a fire support function to deliver accurate fire against Ukrainian positions. Russia has started to employ thermal camouflage on its vehicles and, using a range of other modifications and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), has significantly reduced the detectability of tanks at stand-off ranges. Furthermore, these measures have reduced the probability of kill of a variety of anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) at ranges beyond 1,400 m.\n\n>Russian artillery has begun to significantly refine the Reconnaissance Strike Complex following the destruction of its ammunition stockpiles and command and control infrastructure by guided multiple-launch rocket systems (GMLRS) in July 2022. This has resulted in much closer integration of multiple UAVs directly supporting commanders authorised to apply fires. Russian artillery has also improved its ability to fire from multiple positions and to fire and move, reducing susceptibility to counterbattery fire. The key system enabling this coordination appears to be the Strelets system. There has been a shift in reliance upon 152-mm howitzers to a much greater emphasis on 120-mm mortars in Russian fires; this reflects munitions and barrel availability. Responsive Russian fires represent the greatest challenge to Ukrainian offensive operations. Russian artillery is also increasingly relying on loitering munitions for counterbattery fires.\n\n>Russian electronic warfare (EW) remains potent, with an approximate distribution of at least one major system covering each 10 km of front. These systems are heavily weighted towards the defeat of UAVs and tend not to try and deconflict their effects. Ukrainian UAV losses remain at approximately 10,000 per month. Russian EW is also apparently achieving real time interception and decryption of Ukrainian Motorola 256-bit encrypted tactical communications systems, which are widely employed by the Armed Forces of Ukraine.\n\n>Russian air defences have also seen a significant increase in their effectiveness now that they are set up around known, and fairly static, locations and are properly connected. Although Russia has persistently struggled to respond to emerging threats, over time it has adapted. Russian air defences are now assessed by the Ukrainian military to be intercepting a proportion of GMLRS strikes as Russian point defences are directly connected to superior radar.\n\n>Russian aviation remains constrained to delivering stand-off effects, ranging from responsive lofted S-8 salvos against Ukrainian forming-up points, to FAB-500 glide bombs delivered from medium altitude to ranges up to 70 km. The Ukrainian military notes that Russia has a large stockpile of FAB-500s and is systematically upgrading them with glide kits. Although they only have limited accuracy, the size of these munitions poses a serious threat. The Russian Aerospace Forces remain a \u2018force in being\u2019 and a major threat to advancing Ukrainian forces, although they currently lack the capabilities to penetrate Ukrainian air defences.\n\n>Following the destruction of Russian command and control infrastructure in July 2022, the Russian military withdrew major headquarters out of range of GMLRS and placed them in hardened structures. They also wired them into the Ukrainian civil telecommunications network and used field cables to branch from this to brigade headquarters further forward. Assigned assets tend to connect to these headquarters via microlink, significantly reducing their signature. At the same time, from the battalion down, Russian forces largely rely on unencrypted analogue military radios, reflecting a shortage of trained signallers at the tactical level.\n\n>An overview of Russian adaptation reveals a force that is able to improve and evolve its employment of key systems. There is evidence of a centralised process for identifying shortcomings in employment and the development of mitigations. Nevertheless, much of this adaptation is reactive and is aimed at making up for serious deficiencies in Russian units. The result is a structure that becomes better over time at managing the problems it immediately faces, but also one that struggles to anticipate new threats. The conclusion therefore is that the Russian Armed Forces pose a significant challenge for the Ukrainian military on the defence. Nevertheless, if Ukraine can disrupt Russian defences and impose a dynamic situation on them, Russian units are likely to rapidly lose their coordination. Changes in the air combat environment, for example, have led rapidly to incidents of Russian fratricide.\n\nThe full report is available at the link provided.",

The main road, Peace Boulevard, abuts the manicured Peace Memorial Park, which features landmarks including the Peace Clock Tower and Peace Bell. Elsewhere in the park are the National Peace Memorial Hall and the Flame of Peace. All are dedicated to commemorating the victims of the first atomic strike.\n\n>A thriving industrial hub of 1.2 million, Hiroshima is the center of Japan\u2019s pacifist movement, a powerful political force in a country that\u2019s stayed out of armed conflict for more than 75 years. Beginning on May 19, the city will serve as the backdrop for a summit of the Group of Seven industrialized democracies, where Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who has family ties to Hiroshima, is hoping to build support for reductions to nuclear stockpiles. Yet just a short distance from the monuments to the dead\u2014perhaps 140,000 people by the end of 1945\u2014a different view of international relations is being manifested.\n\n>Prompted by China\u2019s increasingly assertive behavior toward its neighbors, Kishida is expanding Japan\u2019s military at a pace unprecedented in the postwar era, making a sharp break with historical policy. His government in November announced plans to double defense spending to 2% of gross domestic product, or about $80 billion annually. That would likely give Japan the world\u2019s third-largest military budget after the US and China. Breaking a taboo on the deployment of anything but \u201cdefensive\u201d weapons, it may soon field long-range missiles as well as forces capable of coordinated regional offensives.\n\n>Many of the required weapons systems are being made in Hiroshima, of all places. The city is home to one of Japan\u2019s key arms factories, which is preparing to crank up production of artillery pieces and tank cannons. At a shipyard nearby, work is underway on an aircraft carrier\u2014the first such vessel to be operated by Japan since hostilities ended with the US. The area also hosts a major base for the Japanese navy.\n\n>Deepening a hawkish trend begun under his predecessor Shinzo Abe, Kishida argues that these investments are necessary to deter a regional war. His government\u2019s National Defense Strategy, released late last year, describes China as \u201cthe greatest strategic challenge in ensuring the peace and security of Japan.\u201d Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s administration is pursuing advanced weapons such as hypersonic missiles and has constructed artificial islands in the South China Sea to cement maritime claims that Japan and its allies reject. Taiwan, an important economic partner for Tokyo, is of particular concern. China has never ruled out taking the democratically governed island by force and holds periodic military exercises in neighboring waters. A war over its future would threaten regional trade, as well as semiconductor factories on which Japanese companies depend.\n\n\n>Turning Japan into a first-rate military power won\u2019t be easy. The country has a long history of troubled defense projects, and it\u2019s uncertain whether its modest ranks of arms makers, many of which barely break even on military contracts, will be able to meet new demands. At the same time, the government is anxious about becoming overly dependent on imports. To Kishida and his colleagues, producing weapons domestically is essential if Japan is to take responsibility for its own protection.\n\n>The legal and political obstacles could prove more significant, even after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine raised the risks of great-power conflict. When Japan surrendered to the US in 1945, it was a shattered nation, despised across Asia for its wartime brutality. Its new constitution, adopted two years later, stated that its people \u201cforever renounce war\u201d and that \u201cland, sea and air forces \u2026 will never be maintained.\u201d Although those prohibitions haven\u2019t been observed to the letter\u2014Japan has operated what it calls Self-Defense Forces (SDF) since the 1950s\u2014what Kishida is proposing is transformative and controversial. Support for pacifism remains widespread, especially among the older voters who decide elections, and there are substantial hurdles to rewriting Article 9, the constitutional provision restricting the military. Even Abe, Japan\u2019s longest-serving prime minister, was unable to muster the political capital to do it.\n\n>The debate is especially fraught in Hiroshima. The city\u2019s leaders have long preferred not to draw attention to the local arms industry. Few want to inflame political tensions, and peace is the core of the civic brand. But as Kishida and other politicians urge Japanese citizens to consider the implications of a rising China, that\u2019s starting to change. \u201cNow is the time for companies in the defense industry to talk openly,\u201d says Hideki Fukayama, chairman emeritus of the Hiroshima Chamber of Commerce & Industry. Three years old at the time of the atomic blast, Fukayama is one of a dwindling number of hibakusha\u2014a term for survivors that means \u201cperson affected by a bomb\u201d\u2014still living in the city. \u201cWe can\u2019t protect the nation with only what\u2019s written in the constitution,\u201d he says.\n\n>Hiroshima was a hub for the military-industrial complex that allowed Japan to conquer much of Asia in the 1930s and \u201940s. Just to the south, the Kure Naval Arsenal built some of the country\u2019s largest vessels, including the famed battleship Yamato. In the city itself, factories made uniforms for the Imperial Japanese Army\u2019s soldiers and shells for their artillery.\n\n>One of the largest facilities belonged to the Japan Steel Works, a metallurgical company originally founded in Hokkaido. On a campus surrounded by lotus fields, JSW churned out items such as antiaircraft cannons, which shot at the American bombers carrying out nightly raids on Japanese cities toward the end of the war. By then, with factory personnel sent to the front to replace dead or wounded soldiers, the workforce was made up partly of children, who were taken out of classes and placed on assembly lines.\n\n>Yachiyo Kato was 15 years old when she began working at JSW in 1944. She and her classmates pulled 12-hour shifts, seven days a week. After each workday finished, another crop of teenagers would take over to keep the factory running around the clock. Injuries were common, with flying pieces of metal lodging in the students\u2019 eyes and the sharp edges of shell components cutting their fingertips. Government propaganda told them they were helping to ensure victory. \u201cWe were thoroughly taught all the way from elementary school that we wouldn\u2019t spare our lives in order to serve the nation,\u201d says Kato, who\u2019s now 94. \u201cWe thought we all must work hard for Japan. That was all we would think about.\u201d\n\n>On Aug. 6, 1945, JSW was closed\u2014a once-a-month shutdown to save electricity. Kato and some friends made plans to go swimming at a beach outside town. Until then, Hiroshima had been spared major bombing. No one knew why. But Kato carried bandages and a protective hood, to shield her skin from flames, just in case. At 8:15 a.m., she was waiting for a train at a small station. Kato doesn\u2019t remember the blinding flash or deafening sound recalled by others who were in Hiroshima that day. Her first memory is of waking up on the ground, perhaps 30 feet from where she had been standing.\n\n>She was able to get up and locate two of her friends. One of the girls\u2019 faces had turned brown, as though from a sunburn. The other\u2019s right arm was studded with shards of glass. They staggered toward an elementary school to take shelter, where they saw a group of other survivors. \u201cTheir skin was peeled off all the way, hanging from their fingernails,\u201d Kato recalls. \u201cThe three of us huddled together and cried.\u201d\n\n>By then, Kato was working at a JSW branch plant downtown. It was heavily damaged, and she never returned. The main factory was shielded by mountains from the force of the blast, but within 10 days the war was over, and occupying US forces banned it from producing weapons\u2014part of a sweeping plan to eliminate Japan\u2019s capacity to ever again go to war. The workers who\u2019d survived made ends meet by turning their steel-processing expertise to consumer goods such as sewing machines.",

To Kishida and his colleagues, producing weapons domestically is essential if Japan is to take responsibility for its own protection.</p>\n\n<p>The legal and political obstacles could prove more significant, even after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine raised the risks of great-power conflict. When Japan surrendered to the US in 1945, it was a shattered nation, despised across Asia for its wartime brutality. Its new constitution, adopted two years later, stated that its people \u201cforever renounce war\u201d and that \u201cland, sea and air forces \u2026 will never be maintained.\u201d Although those prohibitions haven\u2019t been observed to the letter\u2014Japan has operated what it calls Self-Defense Forces (SDF) since the 1950s\u2014what Kishida is proposing is transformative and controversial. Support for pacifism remains widespread, especially among the older voters who decide elections, and there are substantial hurdles to rewriting Article 9, the constitutional provision restricting the military. Even Abe, Japan\u2019s longest-serving prime minister, was unable to muster the political capital to do it.</p>\n\n<p>The debate is especially fraught in Hiroshima. The city\u2019s leaders have long preferred not to draw attention to the local arms industry. Few want to inflame political tensions, and peace is the core of the civic brand. But as Kishida and other politicians urge Japanese citizens to consider the implications of a rising China, that\u2019s starting to change. \u201cNow is the time for companies in the defense industry to talk openly,\u201d says Hideki Fukayama, chairman emeritus of the Hiroshima Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry. Three years old at the time of the atomic blast, Fukayama is one of a dwindling number of hibakusha\u2014a term for survivors that means \u201cperson affected by a bomb\u201d\u2014still living in the city. \u201cWe can\u2019t protect the nation with only what\u2019s written in the constitution,\u201d he says.</p>\n\n<p>Hiroshima was a hub for the military-industrial complex that allowed Japan to conquer much of Asia in the 1930s and \u201940s. Just to the south, the Kure Naval Arsenal built some of the country\u2019s largest vessels, including the famed battleship Yamato. In the city itself, factories made uniforms for the Imperial Japanese Army\u2019s soldiers and shells for their artillery.</p>\n\n<p>One of the largest facilities belonged to the Japan Steel Works, a metallurgical company originally founded in Hokkaido. On a campus surrounded by lotus fields, JSW churned out items such as antiaircraft cannons, which shot at the American bombers carrying out nightly raids on Japanese cities toward the end of the war. By then, with factory personnel sent to the front to replace dead or wounded soldiers, the workforce was made up partly of children, who were taken out of classes and placed on assembly lines.</p>\n\n<p>Yachiyo Kato was 15 years old when she began working at JSW in 1944. She and her classmates pulled 12-hour shifts, seven days a week. After each workday finished, another crop of teenagers would take over to keep the factory running around the clock. Injuries were common, with flying pieces of metal lodging in the students\u2019 eyes and the sharp edges of shell components cutting their fingertips. Government propaganda told them they were helping to ensure victory. \u201cWe were thoroughly taught all the way from elementary school that we wouldn\u2019t spare our lives in order to serve the nation,\u201d says Kato, who\u2019s now 94. \u201cWe thought we all must work hard for Japan. That was all we would think about.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>On Aug. 6, 1945, JSW was closed\u2014a once-a-month shutdown to save electricity. Kato and some friends made plans to go swimming at a beach outside town. Until then, Hiroshima had been spared major bombing. No one knew why. But Kato carried bandages and a protective hood, to shield her skin from flames, just in case. At 8:15 a.m., she was waiting for a train at a small station. Kato doesn\u2019t remember the blinding flash or deafening sound recalled by others who were in Hiroshima that day. Her first memory is of waking up on the ground, perhaps 30 feet from where she had been standing.</p>\n\n<p>She was able to get up and locate two of her friends. One of the girls\u2019 faces had turned brown, as though from a sunburn. The other\u2019s right arm was studded with shards of glass. They staggered toward an elementary school to take shelter, where they saw a group of other survivors. \u201cTheir skin was peeled off all the way, hanging from their fingernails,\u201d Kato recalls. \u201cThe three of us huddled together and cried.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>By then, Kato was working at a JSW branch plant downtown. It was heavily damaged, and she never returned. The main factory was shielded by mountains from the force of the blast, but within 10 days the war was over, and occupying US forces banned it from producing weapons\u2014part of a sweeping plan to eliminate Japan\u2019s capacity to ever again go to war. The workers who\u2019d survived made ends meet by turning their steel-processing expertise to consumer goods such as sewing machines.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

JSW started out making parts for transport vehicles, followed by recoilless rifles for infantry, and it sent workers abroad to learn new weapons-production techniques. Then, as Japan set up the SDF with American permission, it became the country\u2019s sole postwar artillery manufacturer, one of a limited number of domestic companies permitted to produce arms. Because contracts for a small, heavily regulated military couldn\u2019t support a major business, JSW also diversified into sectors such as plastics.\n\n>Still, the company gradually built up substantial weapons capacity in Hiroshima and developed a network of local suppliers. It operated well under the radar. The local economy revolved around Mazda Motor Corp., which was founded in the area and remains headquartered there. Even today, many residents are only dimly aware of what happens on the JSW grounds. With the very existence of the military still a sensitive topic for some, the company makes no effort to advertise its defense operations. The business cards of its weapons executives say on one side, in English, that they work in JSW\u2019s \u201cordnance business.\u201d The other side, printed in Japanese, says only that they\u2019re responsible for \u201cspecial machinery.\u201d\n\n>The plant that JSW operates in Hiroshima sprawls over a flat plain on the eastern edge of the city, not far from a 2,000-soldier camp for the SDF. When I visited the plant last year, a banner was posted inside one of its office buildings: \u201cStriving to become the global leader in plastics machinery manufacturing,\u201d a reference to the company\u2019s nondefense work. My guide was Keita Yayabe, the Tokyo-based general manager for the JSW ordnance business. He introduced me to three local executives, all of whom asked not to be identified. They were concerned that they and their families might be exposed to harassment if the nature of their jobs was made public.\n\n>I handed over my phone\u2014no photography of the manufacturing buildings is permitted\u2014and followed Yayabe into a cavernous factory hall. Some of the beams supporting the ceiling were rusty; parts of the structure date to the war. There was an incessant buzz from steel being cut, and the smell of machine oil hung in the air. JSW says it\u2019s made about 6,000 large guns since restarting operations in the \u201950s but won\u2019t disclose annual production numbers, citing security concerns.\n\n>One workstation contained a mock-up of a warship\u2019s forward deck, complete with a shaft for lifting ammunition from inside the hull. Here, plant personnel were making 5-inch-caliber guns for mounting on the SDF\u2019s destroyers and frigates. Other workers were overhauling older models. Nearby were two machines for carving spiral grooves into the inside of gun barrels. Such \u201crifling\u201d makes shells spin through the air, stabilizing their path.\n\n>We entered a newer building, added in 2016 to fulfill SDF orders for the Type 19 howitzer, a powerful mobile artillery piece capable of striking targets dozens of kilometers away. After JSW fabricates the cannons, staff mount them onto eight-wheeled trucks. Yayabe told me that once they were tested, they would be delivered to a military unit in central Japan. With growing defense budgets, the country is likely to buy many more weapons such as the Type 19. \u201cWe are hopeful\u201d about increasing procurement, Yayabe said. \u201cWe make capital investments when the Defense Ministry issues orders. We never say no, because we are the only supplier of artillery\u201d in Japan.\n\n>Still, making money from defense production isn\u2019t straightforward. With the Japanese population shrinking, labor shortages are a constant concern, and JSW struggles to compete for industrial workers with deeper-pocketed, better-known local employers such as Mazda. It also doesn\u2019t hire foreign personnel in Hiroshima because of the requirement for security clearances. Other restrictions sharply limit potential revenue. For one thing, JSW doesn\u2019t export its weapons. Japanese military contractors require official permission to sell to overseas customers, and it\u2019s almost never granted\u2014though the government has said the rules may be relaxed.\n\n>According to the Ministry of Defense, the average profit margin for all military contracts is 8%. But in many instances, manufacturers end up bearing unexpected costs for delivery delays or extra testing, which chip away at their returns. \u201cCompanies end up with 2% or 3% profit, and in bad cases they lose money,\u201d says Kyosuke Matsumoto, a manager in the ministry\u2019s procurement division. Despite rising spending, several major industrial groups, including Komatsu Ltd. and Sumitomo Heavy Industries Ltd., have scaled back defense operations in recent years. That, in turn, thins the ranks of smaller subcontractors. Closures have been so frequent that the ministry can\u2019t keep track of how many are gone. \u201cOur technical strength has weakened, and our technological advantage is being threatened,\u201d Matsumoto complains.\n\n>This puts Japanese policymakers in a difficult position. One obvious solution would be to increase the share of imported weapons, currently at about 16%. But even Japan\u2019s closest allies restrict the sharing of cutting-edge technologies, which Tokyo believes it must control to have a truly autonomous military. The government is advancing plans to develop a next-generation fighter aircraft jointly with the UK and Italy, prompted in part by the US\u2019s refusal to provide access to the software source code of American jets. Without such access, a country can\u2019t make independent decisions about upgrades and modifications.\n\n>The upshot is that, if it\u2019s to meet Kishida\u2019s goals, Japan will have to find ways to foster a vibrant defense industry, and one that\u2019s less fearful of criticism. Yayabe\u2019s boss, Takeshi Shinmoto, has spent his entire career in JSW\u2019s defense division, starting in Hiroshima, his hometown, in 1986. He said in an interview that he\u2019s always had to be careful in talking about his work, partly because of confidentiality requirements common to defense manufacturers anywhere, but also out of concern for how others might react.\n\n>JSW is now trying to be less reticent in its relations with the public, including by doing things like letting me into its Hiroshima plant. To managers\u2019 knowledge, the company had never before invited a journalist to see the artillery production line. \u201cPeople are getting to understand gradually what we do,\u201d Shinmoto said. \u201cTheir allergy to us is weakening, little by little.\u201d\n\n>The city of Kure lies about 20 kilometers south of downtown Hiroshima, centered on a series of busy wharves.

Not surprisingly, the area was heavily bombed in the later stages of the war, though some of the original military buildings survived and are still in use.\n\n>The Kure yard is operated by Japan Marine United Corp. (JMU), a shipbuilder based in Yokohama. Its most important project is the overhaul of one of Japan\u2019s biggest modern military vessels, the 248-meter Kaga. Although it resembles an aircraft carrier, with a flat-topped deck, the ship entered service in 2017 carrying only helicopters. The idea of operating fixed-wing jets at sea was still considered taboo. But in 2018 the Abe government announced that the Kaga would be converted to accommodate American-designed F-35 fighter jets, for which Japan is the largest export customer. It\u2019s currently sitting in dry dock, surrounded by cranes and factory buildings. The first stage of the work, which includes strengthening its deck and reshaping its hull, is expected to finish within a year. A sister ship, the Izumo, has already hosted US fighters.\n\n>But even as Japan embarks on one of its most consequential military projects in a generation, officials are anxious about public distaste. In formal communications, the Kaga and Izumo are described, ambiguously, as \u201cmultipurpose escort destroyers.\u201d In 2021 the US secretary of the Navy, Carlos Del Toro, caused controversy in Japan by tweeting that he\u2019d just toured \u201cJapanese Aircraft Carrier Izumo.\u201d The Pentagon was forced to clarify that he wasn\u2019t expressing an official view about the vessel.\n\n>Kure\u2019s naval base is a short distance from the JMU dry dock. The site has been a military facility since the late 19th century\u2014an earlier era of Japan-China tensions\u2014when it was chosen for its proximity to conflict zones in the East China Sea. The same geographic attributes make it useful today, and Kure is the home port for several Japanese submarines as well as surface vessels. I visited one of them, the 151-meter Sazanami, as it sat alongside its pier. In 2008 the destroyer, which is armed with a JSW main gun, made history by becoming the first postwar Japanese naval ship to dock in China, delivering earthquake-relief supplies to Guangdong. It was a time of relative warmth between the two nations, with Japanese companies investing heavily on the mainland and Chinese tourists flocking to Tokyo and Kyoto.\n\n>Relations soon soured, as China pressed claims to the Senkakus, an uninhabited, Japanese-administered archipelago that Beijing refers to as the Diaoyu Islands. After a group of Japanese nationalists visited the islands and raised the country\u2019s flag in 2012, there were protests across China\u2014tolerated, if not encouraged, by the Communist Party. The relationship has gradually deteriorated since, and the Sazanami\u2019s commander, Daisuke Inoue, told me frankly, \u201cChina is our priority.\u201d In the event of aggression, he said, \u201cwe maintain our readiness and ability to strike back.\u201d\n\n>First, volunteers brought water from locations around Hiroshima to the cenotaph for atomic bomb victims, many of whom perished in search of something to drink. Then came the dedication of a registry of the dead. Kishida, wearing a black suit and tie, laid a wreath next to a stone inscribed with the message: \u201cRest in peace. For we shall not repeat the same mistake.\u201d\n\n>It was early August 2022, and hundreds of Japanese politicians and foreign dignitaries had made their annual pilgrimage to Hiroshima for the anniversary of the bombing. Even on such a solemn occasion, it was impossible to avoid the controversy created by recent policies. As Kishida spoke, promising never to repeat \u201cthe calamity on that day 77 years ago,\u201d a raucous protest was audible in the distance. Pacifist groups were staging a rally outside the A-Bomb Dome, a stone-and-steel exhibition hall that improbably withstood the blast. \u201cLet\u2019s use Hiroshima\u2019s anger to prevent constitutional revisions,\u201d one of the banners in the crowd read. A female activist shouted into a microphone: \u201cWe don\u2019t need war, nukes or military bases!\u201d\n\n>Before becoming prime minister in 2021, Kishida presented himself as a moderate on security. He spoke frequently about hearing the stories of hibakusha during childhood trips to Hiroshima, and in 2020 he published a book titled Toward a World Free of Nuclear Weapons. His determination to move even faster on military expansion than Abe therefore surprised political observers. Kishida has said that he intends to revise Article 9 of the constitution during his time in office, which would require a supermajority in both chambers of parliament as well as a national referendum.\n\n>New circumstances partly explain the speed of change. The war in Ukraine brought defense issues to the fore in Japan, as in other countries. The rising tensions over Taiwan, meanwhile, are difficult to ignore. Last summer, China fired a volley of ballistic missiles around the island, some of which then landed in Japanese waters: a warning to Tokyo about the potential costs of getting involved in a conflict.\n\n>It\u2019s also possible that Kishida\u2019s origins provide a political backstop other Japanese leaders lacked. Just as it\u2019s sometimes said that only President Richard Nixon, an inveterate Cold War hawk, could restore US relations with China in the 1970s, it may be that only a prime minister with roots in Hiroshima can bring Japan to a more assertive security posture. Polling indicates that the public is open to the idea. A December survey by broadcaster NHK found that 51% of respondents were in favor of boosting defense spending substantially, with 36% against.\n\n>Kato, the hibakusha who worked for JSW as a teen, says the idea of a rearmed Japan breaks her heart. She has concerns about expanding the SDF and opposes the potential constitutional revision, worrying that the military could accumulate too much power. At another August memorial service, for the 676 students and teachers from her high school who were killed by the atomic bomb, Kato wept just as she had each year before.\n\n>Yet even she is becoming less idealistic amid approaching threats. \u201cJapan has renounced war,\u201d she says, \u201cbut if others attack, Japan will have to protect its citizens.\u201d\n\n>Kato, the hibakusha who worked for JSW as a teen, says the idea of a rearmed Japan breaks her heart.

It was a time of relative warmth between the two nations, with Japanese companies investing heavily on the mainland and Chinese tourists flocking to Tokyo and Kyoto.</p>\n\n<p>Relations soon soured, as China pressed claims to the Senkakus, an uninhabited, Japanese-administered archipelago that Beijing refers to as the Diaoyu Islands. After a group of Japanese nationalists visited the islands and raised the country\u2019s flag in 2012, there were protests across China\u2014tolerated, if not encouraged, by the Communist Party. The relationship has gradually deteriorated since, and the Sazanami\u2019s commander, Daisuke Inoue, told me frankly, \u201cChina is our priority.\u201d In the event of aggression, he said, \u201cwe maintain our readiness and ability to strike back.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>First, volunteers brought water from locations around Hiroshima to the cenotaph for atomic bomb victims, many of whom perished in search of something to drink. Then came the dedication of a registry of the dead. Kishida, wearing a black suit and tie, laid a wreath next to a stone inscribed with the message: \u201cRest in peace. For we shall not repeat the same mistake.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>It was early August 2022, and hundreds of Japanese politicians and foreign dignitaries had made their annual pilgrimage to Hiroshima for the anniversary of the bombing. Even on such a solemn occasion, it was impossible to avoid the controversy created by recent policies. As Kishida spoke, promising never to repeat \u201cthe calamity on that day 77 years ago,\u201d a raucous protest was audible in the distance. Pacifist groups were staging a rally outside the A-Bomb Dome, a stone-and-steel exhibition hall that improbably withstood the blast. \u201cLet\u2019s use Hiroshima\u2019s anger to prevent constitutional revisions,\u201d one of the banners in the crowd read. A female activist shouted into a microphone: \u201cWe don\u2019t need war, nukes or military bases!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Before becoming prime minister in 2021, Kishida presented himself as a moderate on security. He spoke frequently about hearing the stories of hibakusha during childhood trips to Hiroshima, and in 2020 he published a book titled Toward a World Free of Nuclear Weapons. His determination to move even faster on military expansion than Abe therefore surprised political observers. Kishida has said that he intends to revise Article 9 of the constitution during his time in office, which would require a supermajority in both chambers of parliament as well as a national referendum.</p>\n\n<p>New circumstances partly explain the speed of change. The war in Ukraine brought defense issues to the fore in Japan, as in other countries. The rising tensions over Taiwan, meanwhile, are difficult to ignore. Last summer, China fired a volley of ballistic missiles around the island, some of which then landed in Japanese waters: a warning to Tokyo about the potential costs of getting involved in a conflict.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s also possible that Kishida\u2019s origins provide a political backstop other Japanese leaders lacked. Just as it\u2019s sometimes said that only President Richard Nixon, an inveterate Cold War hawk, could restore US relations with China in the 1970s, it may be that only a prime minister with roots in Hiroshima can bring Japan to a more assertive security posture. Polling indicates that the public is open to the idea. A December survey by broadcaster NHK found that 51% of respondents were in favor of boosting defense spending substantially, with 36% against.</p>\n\n<p>Kato, the hibakusha who worked for JSW as a teen, says the idea of a rearmed Japan breaks her heart. She has concerns about expanding the SDF and opposes the potential constitutional revision, worrying that the military could accumulate too much power. At another August memorial service, for the 676 students and teachers from her high school who were killed by the atomic bomb, Kato wept just as she had each year before.</p>\n\n<p>Yet even she is becoming less idealistic amid approaching threats. \u201cJapan has renounced war,\u201d she says, \u201cbut if others attack, Japan will have to protect its citizens.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Kato, the hibakusha who worked for JSW as a teen, says the idea of a rearmed Japan breaks her heart.

They are often a subcontractor for complex satellite instruments, and I think they make small sats, but they've never been the main contractor for any mission I've been involved with.\n\nHere's a rundown of my experience with various aerospace companies over the last 5 years I've been in the space industry:\n\nBoeing: The cliche about MBA's ruining the business are absolutely true from everything I've heard and experienced. They don't foster internal development and growth, they try to subcontract out whatever work they can, and as a result they're eroding their core engineering competencies. The 787 was their last real attempt at a new design and they made a mess out of contracting out every single piece to a different country. All my near-peers that went to Boeing (6 people) left within a couple years, and none of them had anything good to say. The older engineers I work with now from Boeing are behind the curve compared to career engineers from other companies, and they also don't have anything good to say.\n\nSpaceX: Good engineers, who usually jump ship so they can have time for a family or a personal life. Although sometimes they're so used to working in a fast-paced environment that they don't believe in things like documentation or review, and cowboy engineering like that leads to avoidable mistakes\n\nULA: Where I started. Honestly I only have good things to pay, I learned a lot and they developed me to a point I was able to quickly become a high contributor. They did have to retire a lot of experienced engineers and some vehicle programs to become cost-competitive with SpaceX, but Tory Bruno runs a very tight ship and I think they have a very good decade ahead of them. I only left to move back closer to family, and because I got a big fat raise for jumping ship.\n\nLockheed Martin: Pure competence. They have the skills, they have experience, and they retain their talent. They do it right\n\nNASA/JPL: Same as Lockheed, pure competence. Whatever issues their upper management may have, you simply don't land rovers on Mars without being really fucking good at what you do\n\nAerospace Corp: Same as Lockheed and NASA. They're basically the government's contractor for auditing technical work performed on government contracts, so they have insight into what all the major satellite companies and launch companies are doing, and they have the skills to audit the work. Even though having my work audited is annoying and time-consuming, they're always very competent and polite and seem to like their jobs.\n\nNorthrop Grumman: Not too much experience here, but they seem like a decently run company from my limited exposure\n\nNGIS (formerly Orbital ATK): Same as NG, not much exposure but they did their job well\n\nAir Force/Space Force/NRO: Surprisingly competent, although usually the technical work is contracted out and they just manage requirements and risk. I know the military has a bit of a reputation for contract debacles, but it's mostly because they're always trying to push the envelope. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, and it's only noticeable when it doesn't.",

I assume it would be designed to function, perhaps in a diminished capacity, with as many missing parts as possible because you want it to keep functioning if, say, an enemy missile blows part of it up.\n\nSo my guess is that if they detach a launcher from the rest of the battery and send it off on it's own the battery is still going to be about as effective. After all it still has several other launchers, so it's not a large decrease in capability like losing the radar would be.\n\nMy question is how effective that launcher could be on it's own. Does it have any sort of backup radar capability, or ability to network with other radars, perhaps on other SAM platforms? It's my understanding they're also usually remotely controlled by a command center. Can they be fired independently? I'd imagine it would be desirable to have these capabilities in case the command center and radar got blown up, especially since those are the primary targets.\n\nI'm asking because I'd imagine that it's much easier for Ukraine to sneak up to the front lines with a single launcher than a whole battery of what seems like 10+ vehicles, and it's probably a lot quicker to deploy the launchers than the radar and command stations, so that seems like a much more practical way to use them on the front lines.",

However, I've also seen folks on here over the past few months indicate ranges/capability across the various S-300 types are pretty optimistic compared to what you could actually expect.

For example,\n\n-How does PAC 2/3 compare to S-300 in terms of ability to kill a manuvering, evasive target?\n\n-How does the Patriots radar compare to a typical S-300 radar system's when it comes to acquiring targets at the upper reaches of the missile's range?\n\n-Is it possible for Patriot to be interlinked with other NATO supplied radars, allowing the launchers to fire on targets without painting them with Patriot's super powered radar?\n\nIt strikes me that the VKS is in a bit of a tough spot here. They need to operate without losing planes, because many of those airframes are basically irreplaceable. There's also a clear need for Russian tactical airpower, especially if/when Ukraine goes on the offensive.

They are all similar in size and speed, use the same basic guidance method, and have big blast frag warheads. The biggest difference is GEMs' much better seeker and probably the fuze, which enables the warhead to more reliable detonate within the lethal radius.\n\nThe PAC-3 interceptors are a whole different ballgame. This family is all extremely fast, agile at almost any range, and extremely lethal to aircraft should it hit. Being ARH it is also very difficult for an aircraft to tell when being fired up on as well, unlike with PAC-2 there is no big beam painting your aircraft for most of the engagement. Furthermore, the seeker operates way out there in the Ka-band, where a ton of older RWRs cannot listen. This is a problem if you are relying on older generations of aircraft to provide mass. It is an extremely scary weapon should you find yourself in its sights.\n\n>-How does the Patriots radar compare to a typical S-300 radar system's when it comes to acquiring targets at the upper reaches of the missile's range?\n\nVery different. S-300 relies on multiple radars operating in different bands to provide a 360 degree picture even while guiding interceptors, which requires the engagement radar to point in a single direction for the duration of the engagement.\n\nPatriot batteries use a single radar, the MPQ-65 (originally the MPQ-53), which provides coverage over a fixed sector. Part of the PAC-3 upgrade added a second transmitter to the radar, allowing it to look both down low and up high at the same time for simultaneous AAW and BMD missions. PAC-1 and -2 could only perform one mission at a time. The radar is very powerful for its generation and has little issue detecting conventional aircraft and ballistic missile RVs out to the max range of the PAC-2 and CRI interceptors. It's biggest current deficiency is that the MSE interceptor outranges it against ballistic targets, a goal the replacement radar is aiming to fix a long with the lack of 360 degree capability.\n\n>-Is it possible for Patriot to be interlinked with other NATO supplied radars, allowing the launchers to fire on targets without painting them with Patriot's super powered radar?\n\nYes and no. Patriot has had Link 16 integrated for a long time, allowing CRI to in limited circumstances perform over the horizon shots against low altitude targets. Caveat here is that the interceptor must remain within the sector of a MPQ-65 in order to receive midcourse updates. So external sensors can cue but not control Patriot intercepts.

It has a detection range of 400km against 20 m2 RCS target, nearly 250-300 km range against Fighter sized targets (5 m2 ), and compatibility with the new 300-400 km range R-37 (AA-13 Axehead) Hypersonic Missile as well as other medium range missiles like R-77 and Semi-Active R-24. This can simultaneously track 24 targets and can attack 8 targets using Active Radar guided missiles / 4 with semi-active Missiles. As per the reports, it can detect a 0.3 m2 object flying as low as 50 meters above the ground, at a range of 64 km.

I&#39;ll just emphasize again how much of an unknown this whole area of strategic thinking really is. Since 1945 this facet of nuclear deterrence and escalation (&quot;limited&quot; use) has existed purely in the theoretical realm. Which is what makes it so scary.</p>\n\n<p>I guess my overall point is, just because Putin has made the nuclear threat before and failed in his bluff, doesn&#39;t mean he won&#39;t follow through under any circumstances. And potentially those circumstances are quite varied.</p>\n</div>",
