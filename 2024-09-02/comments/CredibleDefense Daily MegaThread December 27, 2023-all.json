If the capability and will is there for the Russians to move slowly forward, what incentive do they have to stop?\n\nRussian rate of replenishment of manpower, shells and armour in comparison to the Ukrainian rate of replenishment, I would argue is more key. \n\nThe Russian launched a major attack of Adviika while the Ukrainian offensive was still going. So, yes they can launch major attacks, albeit prematurely and with minimal success, for now. Their low level of success is due to Ukrainians defending, which again, takes shells they are running out of. Can drones offset the shell hunger somewhat? We shall see. \n\nIf 1 million Russian shells gives the Russians 10km2, you have your number of how many million shells are required to conquer Ukraine.

If I am getting this wrong can you point me to examples of Russian armour being in a shortage? \n\nAs for the economy, yes a further mobilisation will likely cause flight from Russia and more labour shortages in an already tight labour market.

International law and agreements aren't invalidated by US internal legal definitions. Congress and the supreme court doing nothing to stop the head of state signing an agreement that the entire security council also signed is entirely a US democratic failing. \n\nTwo European heads of state signing a treaty together just for one of them to later go, nuh-uh its not binding is preposterous behaviour that doesn't happen because that isn't how you do diplomacy.\n\nTheir parliament votes on if the treaty should be signed, then let the head of state put pen to paper.

They are currently continuing to build new units and reinforce attrited units, but there isn't enough manpower available from volunteers and the existing mobilization system to meet demand. The biggest problem is that the Ukrainian mobilization/conscription system currently in place has a number of major issues that haven't been addressed properly, especially related to corruption (people paying to keep themselves and family out of service) and people using loopholes to skirt service (university students are immune to conscription so many people have enrolled to stay out of the army). Tens if not hundreds of thousands of military age men have also fled the country, despite a ban put in place in February 2022 to prevent this.

The average age of Ukrainian soldiers (same with the Russians by the way) is very high by historical standards, somewhere around the mid-30s.

Demographically speaking, Ukraine (along with the entire post-Soviet sphere) is a rapidly aging society with a disproportionately small number of young people. Ukrainian conscription currently excludes men age 18-27, as that cohort represents the economic and demographic future of Ukraine. If that age group suffers large casualties in the war, Ukraine will suffer major long-term consequences in the form of lower GDP and a smaller population.

He is not trustworthy; he could use prolonged negotiations to bolster his forces for a renewed push, or to lull Western lawmakers into cutting aid for Ukraine; he may be stalling in the hope that Donald Trump, his preferred choice for president, will return to the White House and stiff Ukraine.\n\nBut if Mr. Putin turns out to be serious, Ukraine should not pass up an opportunity to end the bloodshed. Recovered territory is not the only measure of victory in this war.\n\nA painful reality check shows the 600-mile-long Ukrainian-Russian front in a figurative and literal freeze, draining Ukrainian resources and lives without much prospect for change in the foreseeable future. The much-anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive of the past six months exacted a huge cost in casualties and mat\u00e9riel, but barely nudged the front lines. Ukraine\u2019s top military commander has said the fight is at a \u201cstalemate\u201d \u2014 a notion deemed taboo not long ago \u2014 and only an unlikely technological breakthrough by one side or the other could break it. As the year draws to an end, lawmakers in the United States and Europe have separately held up critically needed aid packages for Ukraine, and there\u2019s no certainty how they will fare in the new year.\n\nThe conflict could still take an unexpected turn, as it has before. But the prospect at this juncture is of a long war of attrition, inflicting ever more damage on Ukraine, sacrificing ever more lives and spreading instability over Europe. The way things are going, \u201cUkraine will for the foreseeable future harbor Europe\u2019s most dangerous geopolitical fault line,\u201d argues Michael Kimmage, author of \u201cCollisions,\u201d a new history of the war. He foresees an endless conflict that deepens Russia\u2019s alienation from the West, enshrines Putinism and delays Ukraine\u2019s integration into Europe.\n\nThat, at least, is the bleak prognosis if victory in the war continues to be defined in territorial terms, specifically the goal of driving Russia out of all the Ukrainian lands it occupied in 2014 and over the past 22 months, including Crimea and a thick wedge of southeastern Ukraine, altogether about a fifth of Ukraine\u2019s sovereign territory.\n\nBut regaining territory is the wrong way to imagine the best outcome. True victory for Ukraine is to rise from the hell of the war as a strong, independent, prosperous and secure state, firmly planted in the West. It would be exactly what Mr. Putin most feared from a neighboring state with deep historical ties to Russia, and it would be a testament to what Russia promised to become in 1991, when both countries broke free of the Soviet Union, before Mr. Putin entered the Kremlin and succumbed to grievance and the lure of dictatorial power and imperial illusion.\n\nAny talk of armistice is understandably difficult for Volodymyr Zelensky, the intrepid Ukrainian president who has steadfastly sought to project a morale bolstering picture of steady battlefield successes. It would be very painful, and politically very difficult for him, to halt the fighting without punishing Russia and by leaving it in control of so much Ukrainian land. After his senior military commander, Gen. Valery Zaluzhny, described the true state of affairs as a stalemate in an interview with The Economist in November, Mr. Zelensky bristled at what he perceived as defeatism.\n\nBut to explore an armistice is not to walk away. On the contrary, the fight must go on, even when talks begin, to maintain the military and economic pressure on Russia. Those people who are resisting continued aid to Ukraine, whether some Republicans in Congress or Viktor Orban in Hungary, must not be allowed to abandon the Ukrainians now. If Mr. Putin is seriously looking for a cease-fire, he is doing so on the presumption that the alternative is a continued slaughter of his soldiers, and that there is nothing more he can achieve through destruction, violence or bluster.\n\nAnd stopping the fight is not to grant Mr. Putin a victory, however loudly he may claim one. Ukraine and much of the world will not accept his annexation of any Ukrainian territory. Russia\u2019s army has been mauled and humiliated and the country\u2019s economy has been severed from the West. Mr. Putin launched the invasion 22 months ago convinced that it really would be a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d \u2014 that the Ukrainian government would promptly cave, that the West would prove impotent, and that a Moscow-installed quisling would ensure Ukraine never became independent, successful, free or joined to the European Union.\n\nInstead, Russia was forced into a chaotic retreat from Kyiv and plunged into a terribly costly war with a stalwart Ukraine backed by billions of dollars worth of American and European arms and funds. It took Russian forces, led by mercenaries, more than a year and massive casualties to capture one city, Bakhmut; another key town, Avdiivka, is still in Ukrainian hands despite wave after wave of soldiers, many of them ill-prepared reservists and conscripted convicts, thrown against it.\n\nUntold thousands of Russian soldiers have been sent to their slaughter and untold thousands more of Russia\u2019s best and brightest have fled the country, whether to avoid the war or imprisonment for opposing it. Mismanagement of the war prompted a short-lived mutiny by the head of the mercenary Wagner Group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, followed by his death in a plane crash almost certainly engineered by the Kremlin.",

Ukraine\u2019s top military commander has said the fight is at a \u201cstalemate\u201d \u2014 a notion deemed taboo not long ago \u2014 and only an unlikely technological breakthrough by one side or the other could break it. As the year draws to an end, lawmakers in the United States and Europe have separately held up critically needed aid packages for Ukraine, and there\u2019s no certainty how they will fare in the new year.</p>\n\n<p>The conflict could still take an unexpected turn, as it has before. But the prospect at this juncture is of a long war of attrition, inflicting ever more damage on Ukraine, sacrificing ever more lives and spreading instability over Europe. The way things are going, \u201cUkraine will for the foreseeable future harbor Europe\u2019s most dangerous geopolitical fault line,\u201d argues Michael Kimmage, author of \u201cCollisions,\u201d a new history of the war. He foresees an endless conflict that deepens Russia\u2019s alienation from the West, enshrines Putinism and delays Ukraine\u2019s integration into Europe.</p>\n\n<p>That, at least, is the bleak prognosis if victory in the war continues to be defined in territorial terms, specifically the goal of driving Russia out of all the Ukrainian lands it occupied in 2014 and over the past 22 months, including Crimea and a thick wedge of southeastern Ukraine, altogether about a fifth of Ukraine\u2019s sovereign territory.</p>\n\n<p>But regaining territory is the wrong way to imagine the best outcome. True victory for Ukraine is to rise from the hell of the war as a strong, independent, prosperous and secure state, firmly planted in the West. It would be exactly what Mr. Putin most feared from a neighboring state with deep historical ties to Russia, and it would be a testament to what Russia promised to become in 1991, when both countries broke free of the Soviet Union, before Mr. Putin entered the Kremlin and succumbed to grievance and the lure of dictatorial power and imperial illusion.</p>\n\n<p>Any talk of armistice is understandably difficult for Volodymyr Zelensky, the intrepid Ukrainian president who has steadfastly sought to project a morale bolstering picture of steady battlefield successes. It would be very painful, and politically very difficult for him, to halt the fighting without punishing Russia and by leaving it in control of so much Ukrainian land. After his senior military commander, Gen. Valery Zaluzhny, described the true state of affairs as a stalemate in an interview with The Economist in November, Mr. Zelensky bristled at what he perceived as defeatism.</p>\n\n<p>But to explore an armistice is not to walk away. On the contrary, the fight must go on, even when talks begin, to maintain the military and economic pressure on Russia. Those people who are resisting continued aid to Ukraine, whether some Republicans in Congress or Viktor Orban in Hungary, must not be allowed to abandon the Ukrainians now. If Mr. Putin is seriously looking for a cease-fire, he is doing so on the presumption that the alternative is a continued slaughter of his soldiers, and that there is nothing more he can achieve through destruction, violence or bluster.</p>\n\n<p>And stopping the fight is not to grant Mr. Putin a victory, however loudly he may claim one. Ukraine and much of the world will not accept his annexation of any Ukrainian territory. Russia\u2019s army has been mauled and humiliated and the country\u2019s economy has been severed from the West. Mr. Putin launched the invasion 22 months ago convinced that it really would be a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d \u2014 that the Ukrainian government would promptly cave, that the West would prove impotent, and that a Moscow-installed quisling would ensure Ukraine never became independent, successful, free or joined to the European Union.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, Russia was forced into a chaotic retreat from Kyiv and plunged into a terribly costly war with a stalwart Ukraine backed by billions of dollars worth of American and European arms and funds. It took Russian forces, led by mercenaries, more than a year and massive casualties to capture one city, Bakhmut; another key town, Avdiivka, is still in Ukrainian hands despite wave after wave of soldiers, many of them ill-prepared reservists and conscripted convicts, thrown against it.</p>\n\n<p>Untold thousands of Russian soldiers have been sent to their slaughter and untold thousands more of Russia\u2019s best and brightest have fled the country, whether to avoid the war or imprisonment for opposing it. Mismanagement of the war prompted a short-lived mutiny by the head of the mercenary Wagner Group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, followed by his death in a plane crash almost certainly engineered by the Kremlin.</p>\n</div>",

Russia has a similarly upgraded ATGM, but it's likely these missiles are not interoperable with Ukraine's system. Plus you'd be potentially engineering a workaround for just 4 small patrol vessels, it's just not worth the time thinking about it.

Swapping out these systems now makes them more usable long term, even if they're going to be glorified harbour patrol.   \n\n\nI will say that the 2M-3M seems like an extreme downgrade to the original armament, I have to imagine that the original armament was rendered inoperable to force Russia's hand otherwise simply running down parts first and using the ZTM-1 would have been preferable.",

            "body": ">\\- A series of new artillery systems are being tested in combat conditions (new \"Coalitsiya\" 152mm gun, its wheeled \"Malva\" 152mm version, the 120mm \"Flox\" wheeled-carrier mortar, the 82mm \"Drok\" self-propelled mortar and the \"Derivatsiya\" 57mm SPAAG).\n\nI'm very interested to see the 2S35 Koalitsiya-SV enter full service and mass production, hopefully then we'll be able to glean more information about the types of ammunition it is going to be matched with. The range (with the use of rocket assisted shells) is stated to be 80KM which is either extremely impressive or perhaps optimistic. Regardless it'll be interesting to see if the newer shell types can actually achieve these range improvements.   \n\n\nAlso worth noting that whilst these newer shell types may offer significant improvements to range, ***they will also only provide those benefits if Russia actually buys them.*** Russia have a long history of developing interesting and very effective niche ammunition and technology only to completely ignore it at the procurement level due to cost or other reasons (those historical reasons, namely cost, may not apply in a war setting).   \n\n\nAlso whilst these newer exotic shell types may exist and be available in increasing numbers, the majority of available shells is likely to still be North Korean and Russian manufactured dumb shells, so mileage may vary in terms of how useful these extra range shells will actually be in the grand scheme of things.  \n\n\nIt's also worth noting that the 2S35 Koalitsiya-SV that is likely to be mass produced is different to the Koalitsiya that was originally part of the Armata family. It was originally intended to be based on the T-14 chassis but all of the production models thus far have been based on the T-90 chassis and it's likely to remain that way for the foreseeable future.   \n\n\nThe tooling for mass producing the T-14 chassis simply doesn't exist and even if Uralvagonzavod received the funding and order quantity to justify the expansion, the floor space inside is currently devoted to vehicle refurbishment and T-90M production and as far as I'm aware the last time we had any insight into the facility the spaces in which Armata manufacturing would take place is currently being used to park dismantled tank hulls as they go through refurbishment. I don't see it likely that they choose long term T14 production (as expensive as that would be) over existing (cheaper) vehicle output in the middle of a war. All sources from inside Russia that I've seen have been echoing their statements from before the war that T-14 production is not imperative/required at this stage. This may be some calculation based on wanting to use up the remaining soviet surplus first, probably cost based, whatever it is it's unlikely to change in the short term as the pressure to maintain T-90M production and focus on refurbishing as many vehicles as possible is likely going to win out.  \n\n\nThere are some notable downsides to this of course. The T-14 hull would have offered various improvements in power plant, fuel efficiency, protection etc. The armoured capsule alone is a significant crew protection improvement over the T-90 hull.  \n\n\nIt's also worth noting that Russia is prioritizing T-90M production at Uralvagonzavod, ergo trying to ship as many T-90M's out of the door as possible. It's entirely possible that pressing tank needs from the war will delay the delivery of these newer SPG's given they are reliant on the same hull and would impact the delivery of tanks, which Russia is losing at a much faster rate than SPG's.  \n\n\nOn the note of crew, the Koalitsiya can apparently be operated by as little as 2 crew with three being the preferred number, that will be a significant reduction from the existing number operating on various SPG's and also the many towed guns that Russia have brought back into service. It's also supposedly got a 15+ shell a minute fire rate which according to state sources is due to a new pneumatic autoloader, but again this is one of those claims that's very difficult to take at face value until we see it actually in service and hear more back from the crews.   \n\n\nTo be clear I don't think Koalitsiya's are some sort of silver bullet, I just really like new SPG's and this one has some interesting stats that I'd like to see tested in real scenarios. It will also be very interesting to see if recently vastly increased Russian defence spending trickles down to the more exotic ammunition types.",
