As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

It was only recently bought by a major Ukrainian investment bank Dragon Capital (100% owned by a Czech guy). The team and editing policy was left the same. Soo what more can you want from a Ukrainian media? Long history of fighting corruption and conflicts with every Ukrainian administration including Zelensky, creatpr murdered for truth, owned by a European investor who is not pushing any narratives. About as good as it gets in my book.</p>\n</div>",

In particular, the farther left parties have a lot of Kurdish activists, and the previous government depended on the support of one of them (they only had a majority of one MP, and one of the leftists was a vocally pro-SDF Kurd activist).

        "body": "If anyone follows my ramblings recently they've probably seen my rants about Bakhmut and why the retreat should be performed because it's the sensible military and political choice. I'm going to go down a list as to why I think it's the right decision:\n\n- They're not preventing failure: [Current map of Bakhmut](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FrP0NMGXoAAFIvu?format=jpg&name=large). With the latest tactical breakthrough that just happened the other day in the SW part of the city, things aren't looking good. Most of the city is already lost at this point. The threat of encirclement is very close, either a breakthrough at Khromove happens or it's outflanked from the north, or continued progress from the south, and then that's that.\n\n- Shortening the line is tactically advantageous: Considering Bakhmut is in a deep salient at this point, if they retreated out of that pocket the line would be shortened by approximately 65% (I actually measured the lines on a map). That doesn't mean a retreat to the canal, just out of the city itself. Not only does that free up **a lot** of units, but it also places those that remain in a domineering tactical position with secure flanks, totally secure supply lines, and high ground terrain to defend from. And behind them they can still fall back to the canal. All of that together means fewer units are needed to hold it, they will take fewer casualties so their overall manpower replacement needs will be lower, and they'll require less heavy fires to perform their mission, they'll conserve ammunition, especially artillery, which is EXTREMELY important if they want to go on the offensive soon.\n\n- There is no operational risk to losing Bakhmut: For the Russians to reach Sloviansk and Kramatorsk means going over a ridgeline and canal that can still be defended. Siversk's southern flank is already vulnerable. And Sloviansk and Kramatorsk are already inside Russian MLRS range and have been for some time so they can start hitting them whenever they want. \n\n- Severodonetsk 2: By becoming so laser focused on continuing the struggle in Severodonetsk and reinforcing it, the UAF didn't have the manpower to support the southern flank of the Donbas Salient, and it's loss caused the collapse of half the salient and retreat from all of Luhansk. While the Ukrainians reinforce Bakhmut to hold it, things are getting worse elsewhere. For example at Avdiivka, which went from [this a month ago](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FpG4KLsakAIqgQP?format=jpg&name=large), to [this two weeks ago](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fp_jVEhWAAAhqHI?format=jpg&name=large), to [to this yesterday](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FrNFQFIXwAAERYd?format=jpg&name=900x900). Notice anything familiar? It's about to get outflanked. Why? At least partly because they didn't have enough to hold the Russians back. Why don't they have enough to hold? Because resources went elsewhere.\n\n- Kill Ratio Strategy is bullsht: It's literally never worked, so why are people pushing it now?  It's all based on assumptions, that the math is correct and that the enemy are weak and will break from losses. But the math is terrible because it doesn't consider variables, such as: how the 5-7:1 figures were created, the timeframe they're averaged from, what they constituted exactly (KIA only? KIA and WIA? irrevocable losses?), who in the UAF and Wagner/RAF took them (how much of the ~40-50k Wagner excon recruited to be cannon fodder are included in that figure?), etc. And the assumptions about Russian willpower and future manpower strengths are ridiculous, they already mobilized so how is killing barely trained grunts, tankers, and the occasional artilleryman going to break future Russian warfighting capabilities when they can keep doing more mobilizing? \n\n-  Attrit VDV and quality Wagner: If there is a focus to remove that threat, if the Ukrainians retreat from the city of Bakhmut, it's not like those units are going back to Russia. They are still conducting a broad front offensive because they want to take the Donbas, and they want to weaken Ukrainian offensive capabilities (manpower and supplies used up now can't be used in the spring summer). It's better to fight those \"elite\" formations from positions more closely resembling Vuhledar than the current Bakhmut situation.\n\n- Politics: Nobody really cares if Ukraine retreats except the one whose opinion should be ignored. It's not a test of wills, it's political dck waving. The US definitely doesn't care, it's recommended to retreat. A significant chunk of the UAF don't care, especially the defenders. Yes, the Russians will make a big deal of it. So what? When Soledar fell, was that the end of the world? When Luhansk fell, was that the end of the world? If Ukraine wants to win a battle of wills, launch a successful offensive after the mud season ends and prove they're worth supporting for the long run.",

I&#39;m going to go down a list as to why I think it&#39;s the right decision:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>They&#39;re not preventing failure: <a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FrP0NMGXoAAFIvu?format=jpg&amp;name=large\">Current map of Bakhmut</a>. With the latest tactical breakthrough that just happened the other day in the SW part of the city, things aren&#39;t looking good. Most of the city is already lost at this point. The threat of encirclement is very close, either a breakthrough at Khromove happens or it&#39;s outflanked from the north, or continued progress from the south, and then that&#39;s that.</p></li>\n<li><p>Shortening the line is tactically advantageous: Considering Bakhmut is in a deep salient at this point, if they retreated out of that pocket the line would be shortened by approximately 65% (I actually measured the lines on a map). That doesn&#39;t mean a retreat to the canal, just out of the city itself. Not only does that free up <strong>a lot</strong> of units, but it also places those that remain in a domineering tactical position with secure flanks, totally secure supply lines, and high ground terrain to defend from. And behind them they can still fall back to the canal. All of that together means fewer units are needed to hold it, they will take fewer casualties so their overall manpower replacement needs will be lower, and they&#39;ll require less heavy fires to perform their mission, they&#39;ll conserve ammunition, especially artillery, which is EXTREMELY important if they want to go on the offensive soon.</p></li>\n<li><p>There is no operational risk to losing Bakhmut: For the Russians to reach Sloviansk and Kramatorsk means going over a ridgeline and canal that can still be defended. Siversk&#39;s southern flank is already vulnerable. And Sloviansk and Kramatorsk are already inside Russian MLRS range and have been for some time so they can start hitting them whenever they want. </p></li>\n<li><p>Severodonetsk 2: By becoming so laser focused on continuing the struggle in Severodonetsk and reinforcing it, the UAF didn&#39;t have the manpower to support the southern flank of the Donbas Salient, and it&#39;s loss caused the collapse of half the salient and retreat from all of Luhansk. While the Ukrainians reinforce Bakhmut to hold it, things are getting worse elsewhere. For example at Avdiivka, which went from <a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FpG4KLsakAIqgQP?format=jpg&amp;name=large\">this a month ago</a>, to <a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fp_jVEhWAAAhqHI?format=jpg&amp;name=large\">this two weeks ago</a>, to <a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FrNFQFIXwAAERYd?format=jpg&amp;name=900x900\">to this yesterday</a>. Notice anything familiar? It&#39;s about to get outflanked. Why? At least partly because they didn&#39;t have enough to hold the Russians back. Why don&#39;t they have enough to hold? Because resources went elsewhere.</p></li>\n<li><p>Kill Ratio Strategy is bullsht: It&#39;s literally never worked, so why are people pushing it now?  It&#39;s all based on assumptions, that the math is correct and that the enemy are weak and will break from losses. But the math is terrible because it doesn&#39;t consider variables, such as: how the 5-7:1 figures were created, the timeframe they&#39;re averaged from, what they constituted exactly (KIA only? KIA and WIA? irrevocable losses?), who in the UAF and Wagner/RAF took them (how much of the ~40-50k Wagner excon recruited to be cannon fodder are included in that figure?), etc. And the assumptions about Russian willpower and future manpower strengths are ridiculous, they already mobilized so how is killing barely trained grunts, tankers, and the occasional artilleryman going to break future Russian warfighting capabilities when they can keep doing more mobilizing? </p></li>\n<li><p>Attrit VDV and quality Wagner: If there is a focus to remove that threat, if the Ukrainians retreat from the city of Bakhmut, it&#39;s not like those units are going back to Russia. They are still conducting a broad front offensive because they want to take the Donbas, and they want to weaken Ukrainian offensive capabilities (manpower and supplies used up now can&#39;t be used in the spring summer). It&#39;s better to fight those &quot;elite&quot; formations from positions more closely resembling Vuhledar than the current Bakhmut situation.</p></li>\n<li><p>Politics: Nobody really cares if Ukraine retreats except the one whose opinion should be ignored. It&#39;s not a test of wills, it&#39;s political dck waving. The US definitely doesn&#39;t care, it&#39;s recommended to retreat. A significant chunk of the UAF don&#39;t care, especially the defenders. Yes, the Russians will make a big deal of it. So what? When Soledar fell, was that the end of the world? When Luhansk fell, was that the end of the world? If Ukraine wants to win a battle of wills, launch a successful offensive after the mud season ends and prove they&#39;re worth supporting for the long run.</p></li>\n</ul>\n</div>",

It's not that hard. Stick and move, don't keep all your forces in the exact same place day after day, take advantage of movement in every direction at every opportunity. It requires a few things: good communication (which the Ukrainians supposedly have), decentralized command authority by senior officers (with necessary trust), tactical reserves (only a small portion of the unit should be \"on the line\" and only as a screen), and an operational scheme and strategy that can't be terrain focused, as retreats will be necessary at certain times.\n\nI think the Ukrainians would do much much better, kill more Russians and lose less troops doing a maneuver defense at the tactical level. And likely not lose much more territory than they already would using a static positional defense.\n\nThe problem with that is permission to retreat is as decentralized as every other aspect of command. It means Kyiv plays no role other than supporting the regional commands with whatever they need, who in turn provide the corps level equivalent operational commanders with whatever they need, who provide the tactical commands with whatever they need, otherwise just coordinating. Not giving instructions, definitely not giving platoons, companies and battalions permission to move. \n\nBy and large through the war, the Ukrainians have been performing strict positional defenses (static, no permission to retreat) at the operation level and at the battalion, brigade and division-esque level (UAF doesn't have divisions though it should). I've heard them claim they use it at the platoon and company level, though it seems what they're talking about are putting squad sized outposts forward of the lines and allowing those to retreat if necessary, but not much else. \n\nMy initial suggestions about retreating from Bakhmut were in keeping with the existing strategic policy of positional defense, deciding that \"Hold At All Cost\" has been met in Bakhmut, because now the cost is too great to hold and it's a waste of manpower and resources for poor reasons.",

When it came to a strategy of attrition and the \u201ccrossover point,\u201d the issue was not that Westmoreland had inaccurate information about the enemy forces being destroyed. The crossover point strategy relied on a basic equation: on one side, the number of soldiers the North Vietnamese could (or were willing to) recruit, train, and deploy into South Vietnam, on the other, the number the U.S. military could kill, capture, or deter. With the benefit of hindsight, what appears dramatically off in Westmoreland\u2019s understanding of this equation is not the body count. Rather, the U.S. military, vastly underestimated the casualties the enemy was prepared to take as well as the degree of control the enemy was able to exercise over his losses by choosing when not to engage with the Americans.\n\nThe problem wasn't the counts, which post-war studies have shown were more or less accurate (the point about platoon commanders embellishing numbers is beside the point, MACV understood this was happening and accounted for it as it processed the data). Nor was it the *idea* of a tipping point, which logic dictates all militaries have. It was that the US could not 1) Stop North Vietnam from raising more troops, 2) push North Vietnam to a strategic casualty threshold, nor 3) operationally cut the Ho Chi Minh trail, bombing was what they relied on but it didn't really choke off the flow of men or supplies as the USAF predicted. Oh and that war was outside MACV control until, I think, 1969. So after the decision to withdraw had already been made. Westmoreland's legal troubles are fun, and Lewis Sorley makes a lot of hay out of it in that atrocious biography he wrote of Westmoreland, but it doesn't really reflect what was going on at MACV.

Insisting he was is another one of these fun canards from the 70s & 80s which doesn't hold up. Giap wasn't planning much through Tet, because Giap was a Ho-ist. As you may expect he was aligned with Ho Chi Minh, and was a legend from the French War. But in 1963 the leadership in Hanoi flipped from the Ho-ists to the Le Duan faction. Most of Ho's supporters, including Giap, were soft-purged from leadership, while Ho himself became a figurehead. The dispute was around renewing an offensive in the south, which Ho opposed but Le Duan supported. Giap, a Ho-ist, was punished for his resistance to calls for renewed fighting in 1963 and 64, and so he missed out on pretty much all of the planning for the next 4 years.

The best evidence indicates that he disliked the plan, and when it became obvious that L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n and V\u0103n Ti\u1ebfn D\u0169ng were going to conduct it anyway, he left Vietnam for medical treatment in Hungary, and did not return until after the offensive had begun.\n\nFor most of 1967 Giap was in Hungary getting treatment for an unnamed illness. His quick return in January 1968 to help plan the battle of Khe Sanh highlights that Giap was not really all that sick, he had been purged. Like many post-Khrushchev Communist leaders Giap had been asked to \"go the fuck away\" because he opposed what the central party (The Duan-ists) were doing. Not only did Giap not help plan Tet, he had almost no idea what was going on in Hanoi until well after the fact. Now Giap would eventually come back into the fold, by 1975 he was again helping to plan the attack into the south. After final victory, and the death of Ho in 1969, Giap became a kind of talisman of victory. More than any other living Vietnamese communist, Giap had an unassailable reputation. He also very quickly went splitsies agan with the Duan-ists, who it should be seen never really liked him. This combination of outsider and legendary status is what paved the way for him to give those taped interviews in the 1980s about the war. And what was Giap going to say? \"Oh well golly gee guys, I wasn't in Hanoi because I told Le Duan his plan for Tet sucked and I didn't think we should keep fighting, so I have no idea why things were done.\" Of course not. When sat in front of western cameras, Giap told them exactly what they, and he, wanted to hear. Giap had planned Tet all along, it was a masterstroke of strategic brilliance, and it had always aimed to attack western public opinion. None of that is true, but who needs the truth when it comes to myth building? Giap, ever the strategist, fed his enemy what he knew they wanted to hear so he could slip in what he really wanted to say, which was that he was great. \n\nLe Duan, on the other hand, was not using a strategy of exhaustion.

We're asking these questions of Ukraine, but not of Russia which sort of skews the discussion.

If they wanted to prevent the city and not need to retake it, they waited way way way too long. \n\nWhat are they going to do if a cease fire is declared? Put up dividers into city? That whole location is indefensible, they'd need to retreat anyway, Bakhmut sits in a valley with a narrow river surrounded by high ground that the Russians mostly hold east, south and north.\n\n>So there's a fair case that Ukraine's defense of the city has a strategic value to them far greater than what Russia would gain by taking it. If your opponent is making a strategic mistake, it's not a terrible play to let that mistake go on as long as possible.\n\nStrategically, Bakhmut only acts as a path to the ridgeline that needs to be taken in order to then take Sloviansk, with the rest of the Donbas, Russia's stated strategic goal. However, it's already been penetrated north and south of it, so that's gone. So what's left? What strategic value does holding that pocket, possess when it's placed in such a precarious tactical position that defenders are automatically disadvantaged? \n\nPolitical. So \"Bakhmut Holds\" can be acclaimed another day. And they want to keep that positivity going with the shortest break in time between \"The Fall of Bakhmut\" and their next victory, that only happens after they go on the offensive. They're trying to dodge bad headlines.\n\nBut the problem with that, is it's nonsense. Ukraine morale never plummeted just because they lost territory or even battle, not when they possess the information operations/propaganda apparatus they do and the near total support of Western media. They write their own headlines themselves or they're written by supporters. They have untold options to spread positivity and manipulate the situation, such as promoting their desire to SAVE their troops instead of holding what remains of that city as it's being encircled. Instead it's a battle of wills between Zelensky and Putin, the two individuals who shouldn't be deciding battles over small cities. \n\nWhy won't they? Because someone spent months talking up Bakhmut. Just like he spent too long talking up Severodonetsk...\n\n> I've viewed Bakhmut as a major fixing action, focusing Russian efforts and forces in the area, likey at a cost somewhere else.\n\nThat goes both ways. UAF units are being fixed in larger than necessary size to the terrible location of Bakhmut when they could be used elsewhere. Supplies and especially artillery are also funneled there when they can be used elsewhere.\n\n>So to me the biggest relevant question is to what extent to Ukrainian losses in Bakhmut impact the ability of Ukraine to counterattack somewhere else?\n\nTheir ability to launch a successful strategic counteroffensive after the mud season ends in 1.5-2 months will be predicated largely on their own force capabilities, especially competent and quality manpower, supported by lots of supplies,, especially artillery ammunition. They're being forced to tap heavily into both to withstand the Russian offensive.\n\nMy point is to try to limit the cost. They'll still be killing Russians if they move out of [this pocket](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FrP0NMGXoAAFIvu?format=jpg&name=large). \n\nIf they do that, they can rescue [this place](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FrP0PuDXwAISSwN?format=jpg&name=large) to stop it from getting the Bakhmut experience. They can also reinforce [this flank](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FrP0XLzWAAAvwdJ?format=jpg&name=large), which is already under threat from three sides and is a potential disaster waiting to happen. \n\nRight now the Ukrainians can't reinforce either of those other locations without AGAIN tapping into their strategic reserve, the one that's supposed to be prepping for the offensive. If they retreat from Bakhmut that frees manpower and supplies to either restore other locations or they go back to the reserve making them stronger for their eventual offensive. \n\nEspecially artillery ammo. Unless Biden unlocks DPICM, then Ukraine is not going to have a very large stockpile and their fire rates will not allow them to buy profess with overwhelming fires, or to protect their troops. They too are an artillery centric army, they had the near identical amount of artillery to the Russians before this war and they both share extremely similar doctrine. They need to conserve ammo as much as possible and that means choosing to fight from advantageous positions. Bakhmut isn't one.",

If they wanted to prevent the city and not need to retake it, they waited way way way too long. </p>\n\n<p>What are they going to do if a cease fire is declared? Put up dividers into city? That whole location is indefensible, they&#39;d need to retreat anyway, Bakhmut sits in a valley with a narrow river surrounded by high ground that the Russians mostly hold east, south and north.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>So there&#39;s a fair case that Ukraine&#39;s defense of the city has a strategic value to them far greater than what Russia would gain by taking it.

            "body": "Good points, agree with the whole analysis. It really seems confounding, I dont buy the KDR numbers, and as you point out even if true its not really good tactical and operational practice. Its not worth it to feed the meat grinder, especially as Russia still holds a strategic manpower advantage.\n\nI like to think of battles in terms of the broader strategy. I've applied this lens to Bakhmut from the Russian side, but for the Ukrainians what exactly is left to win by holding the city? How exactly does Ukraine bring the war to a closer end by holding the city, and would the city's loss in a 'freeze in place' outcome really be *that* bad? There is basically nothing left at this point. Common sense suggests that the war might be better won by withdrawing just a few KM to the next terrain feature, setting up another stronger defense, and focusing on holding the cities which are not (yet) totally razed. The 'not one step back' mentality works politically and in terms of morale, but its not really (IMO) the correct tactical choice. I much prefer a bend-dont-break approach, especially given Ukraine is probably not capable of a mobile defense, and now would be the time to bend. Actually probably two weeks ago was time to bend. \n\nI fear that UA HHQ has decided to adopt a 'Soviet-style' defense, which aimed to hold every inch of ground because hey! You can always turn a salient into a bridgehead or an anvil for a future counter attack. Soviet operational doctrine on this point always seem overly optimistic to me, but made sense in the context of the kind of war they wanted to fight. Which was a constant offensive, in which even a successful defensive battle represented an operational defeat.

It really seems confounding, I dont buy the KDR numbers, and as you point out even if true its not really good tactical and operational practice. Its not worth it to feed the meat grinder, especially as Russia still holds a strategic manpower advantage.</p>\n\n<p>I like to think of battles in terms of the broader strategy. I&#39;ve applied this lens to Bakhmut from the Russian side, but for the Ukrainians what exactly is left to win by holding the city? How exactly does Ukraine bring the war to a closer end by holding the city, and would the city&#39;s loss in a &#39;freeze in place&#39; outcome really be <em>that</em> bad? There is basically nothing left at this point. Common sense suggests that the war might be better won by withdrawing just a few KM to the next terrain feature, setting up another stronger defense, and focusing on holding the cities which are not (yet) totally razed. The &#39;not one step back&#39; mentality works politically and in terms of morale, but its not really (IMO) the correct tactical choice. I much prefer a bend-dont-break approach, especially given Ukraine is probably not capable of a mobile defense, and now would be the time to bend. Actually probably two weeks ago was time to bend. </p>\n\n<p>I fear that UA HHQ has decided to adopt a &#39;Soviet-style&#39; defense, which aimed to hold every inch of ground because hey! You can always turn a salient into a bridgehead or an anvil for a future counter attack. Soviet operational doctrine on this point always seem overly optimistic to me, but made sense in the context of the kind of war they wanted to fight. Which was a constant offensive, in which even a successful defensive battle represented an operational defeat. Its application, on both sides, in this war is badly out of context and produces negative results.</p>\n</div>",

There seems to be a long-standing tension/distrust between the Haredi and the military, specifically over the exemption (and now the IDF is supposed to obey a government with several Haredi ministers); likewise, the non-working dogma might cause social tensions due to the increasing burden on the welfare system. Haredim have a very high fertility rate and their communities seem quite isolated from the broader Israeli society.</p>\n</div>",

After the discovery, artillery fire was launched, but due to the place of parking behind the house (see video) and the terrible shell hunger of ALL artillery systems defending this outfit, the target was not hit. The nearest gap is in the roof of the house. But he managed to stall the tank, and the crew took cover in the nearest building. The shooting was over, see the background above.

It's about the aftermath and occupation.\n\nStewart as a 30 year old diplomat got granted governorship of an Iraqi province (which in itself is pretty crazy) reporting directly to US command . He had to sit in on early meetings where the US leadership discussed how they could crush the Iraqi trade union movement..... whilst his 'constituents' still had no power and were rioting. \n\nI don't think i've heard a better example of the ...'problematic factors' that underpinned the entire project. \n\nThey both also seem to be quite clear in stating that the brits at least saw it for the failure it was from very early on... which I'd like to believe, but they would be incentivised to deflect the blame so it's hard to say how true that is.\n\n/u/Duncan-M posted [this article](https://theintercept.com/2021/09/08/afghanistan-iraq-generals-soldiers-disciplined-911/) a couple of weeks back which made a compelling case that the military leadership were too busy engaging in politicking and self promotion to admit to the failures or properly grapple with the challenges presented, but I think it's obvious that the problems went a lot deeper\n\nFun tidbit: The UK released a joint intelligence report in feb 2003 saying that in the south of Iraq the key risks we would face would be refugees, environmental damage and the impact of chemical and biological weapons..... so it's hard to pretend that ignorance and ideology wasn't a universal problem.\n\nI'd like to re-emphasise [the point](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/11q7qt6/credibledefense_daily_megathread_march_13_2023/jc2lthn/) i made the other day about how essential it is to actually have functioning and capable intelligence agencies that have the first clue about the things they're reporting on.",

He had to sit in on early meetings where the US leadership discussed how they could crush the Iraqi trade union movement..... whilst his &#39;constituents&#39; still had no power and were rioting. </p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t think i&#39;ve heard a better example of the ...&#39;problematic factors&#39; that underpinned the entire project. </p>\n\n<p>They both also seem to be quite clear in stating that the brits at least saw it for the failure it was from very early on... which I&#39;d like to believe, but they would be incentivised to deflect the blame so it&#39;s hard to say how true that is.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/Duncan-M\">/u/Duncan-M</a> posted <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2021/09/08/afghanistan-iraq-generals-soldiers-disciplined-911/\">this article</a> a couple of weeks back which made a compelling case that the military leadership were too busy engaging in politicking and self promotion to admit to the failures or properly grapple with the challenges presented, but I think it&#39;s obvious that the problems went a lot deeper</p>\n\n<p>Fun tidbit: The UK released a joint intelligence report in feb 2003 saying that in the south of Iraq the key risks we would face would be refugees, environmental damage and the impact of chemical and biological weapons..... so it&#39;s hard to pretend that ignorance and ideology wasn&#39;t a universal problem.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d like to re-emphasise <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/11q7qt6/credibledefense_daily_megathread_march_13_2023/jc2lthn/\">the point</a> i made the other day about how essential it is to actually have functioning and capable intelligence agencies that have the first clue about the things they&#39;re reporting on.</p>\n</div>",

Russia is on the offensive in multiple locations right now and suffering disproportionate losses as a result. Russia has averaged about 3 vehicles lost to each Ukrainian loss since the war began and their casualties are almost undoubtedly higher than Ukraine's. Bleeding out your enemy by bleeding more than them is uh quite a strategy. \n\nRussia *was* doing a good job consolidating its strength, reforming, and preparing for a future offensive under Surovikin, but then Gerasimov took over and launched a multifront campaign before the Russian military was ready for it with predictable results. \n\n>I don't track specific units but Russia has a massive amount of T90s, T80s and T72s and a force of 100k-250k uncommitted outside of Ukraine.\n\nNo, they don't. The mobiks have at this point all been deployed to Ukraine, though not all are in frontline units. They're being used to replenish losses, not create new units. Most of Russia's most advanced kit is already on the frontlines though they have been using it more sparingly recently (resulting in heavier personnel losses instead).\n\nThere's absolutely zero evidence that Russia has a large force of advanced kit and well-trained troops just hanging out in Russia. Quite the opposite in fact.\n\nEdit: not sure if you added these parts later or what, but wanted to respond to them. \n\n>The KIA MIA on the books for RU regulars are constantly estimated between 16k (low) to 35k (high).\n\nWhere are you seeing this exactly? The Mediazona/BBC count as of March 3, 2023 has *confirmed* more than 16,000 KIA and rhat's the absolute floor for Russian losses, they think the *conservative* estimate is at least 32k Russian KIA. Those figures exclude all LDPR losses too. They also estimate *minimum* total losses for Russian units (again, excluding LDPR) at 150,000 which isn't far off the NATO estimates of about 250,000 total Russian-aligned casualties.\n\n>Nothing that you said even indicates that you don't think this is their plan. It's clear that you just think it's a bad plan and that they're screwing up.\n\nThere's no Russian plan of throwing the \"expendable\" units at Ukrainian lines first, considering elite units have been involved in the fighting since day 1. Recent Russian advances in places like Avdiivka, Marinka, Bakhmut, and the floundering disaster at Vuhledar are all being spearheaded by elite units like Wagner, VDV, Naval infantry, and Guards units. So if Russia was preparing a huge force of \"elite\" units to throw at Ukraine after they're done turning their actual elite units into meat, that would be quite the strategy.",

Bleeding out your enemy by bleeding more than them is uh quite a strategy. </p>\n\n<p>Russia <em>was</em> doing a good job consolidating its strength, reforming, and preparing for a future offensive under Surovikin, but then Gerasimov took over and launched a multifront campaign before the Russian military was ready for it with predictable results. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I don&#39;t track specific units but Russia has a massive amount of T90s, T80s and T72s and a force of 100k-250k uncommitted outside of Ukraine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>No, they don&#39;t. The mobiks have at this point all been deployed to Ukraine, though not all are in frontline units. They&#39;re being used to replenish losses, not create new units. Most of Russia&#39;s most advanced kit is already on the frontlines though they have been using it more sparingly recently (resulting in heavier personnel losses instead).</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s absolutely zero evidence that Russia has a large force of advanced kit and well-trained troops just hanging out in Russia. Quite the opposite in fact.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: not sure if you added these parts later or what, but wanted to respond to them. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The KIA MIA on the books for RU regulars are constantly estimated between 16k (low) to 35k (high).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Where are you seeing this exactly? The Mediazona/BBC count as of March 3, 2023 has <em>confirmed</em> more than 16,000 KIA and rhat&#39;s the absolute floor for Russian losses, they think the <em>conservative</em> estimate is at least 32k Russian KIA. Those figures exclude all LDPR losses too. They also estimate <em>minimum</em> total losses for Russian units (again, excluding LDPR) at 150,000 which isn&#39;t far off the NATO estimates of about 250,000 total Russian-aligned casualties.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Nothing that you said even indicates that you don&#39;t think this is their plan. It&#39;s clear that you just think it&#39;s a bad plan and that they&#39;re screwing up.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There&#39;s no Russian plan of throwing the &quot;expendable&quot; units at Ukrainian lines first, considering elite units have been involved in the fighting since day 1. Recent Russian advances in places like Avdiivka, Marinka, Bakhmut, and the floundering disaster at Vuhledar are all being spearheaded by elite units like Wagner, VDV, Naval infantry, and Guards units. So if Russia was preparing a huge force of &quot;elite&quot; units to throw at Ukraine after they&#39;re done turning their actual elite units into meat, that would be quite the strategy.</p>\n</div>",
