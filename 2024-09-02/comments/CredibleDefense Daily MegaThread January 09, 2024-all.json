        "body": "After watching a few videos I got more information about an interesting topic, that of \"refuseniks\" in the Ukrainian Army and how this is being addressed.\n\nIn this [video](https://censor.net/en/video_news/3459751/as_conscientious_objector_he_received_order_for_courage_vodolaz_58th_separate_motorised_infantry_brigade) (the subtitles' translation is far from perfect, but I think I understood enough) a soldier, callsign \"Vodolaz,\" from Sumy, is interviewed. He joined the ranks of the Armed Forces from the very beginning: he fought in the 117th TDF Brigade of Sumy Oblast at the start of the invasion, receiving a decoration for bravery shown there (Order for Courage of Third Class). Afterwards, the soldiers were offered to move to the Ground Forces. Vodolaz accepted and was assigned to the 63rd Separate Rifle Battalion (I knew nothing about this unit, except that in December it was mentioned by a Russian Telegram channel as being part of the Avdiivka garrison).\n\nAfter the start of the Avdiivka offensive, this battalion was transferred to the Donbas and on October 19 arrived in Pokrovsk, where Vodolaz and the rest of the company (consisting of 65 soldiers) had to find accommodation on their own and at their own monetary expenses. Vodolaz in the video complains often about the battalion commander, a lieutenant colonel. He says that only about 20 soldiers from his company have ever seen his face. He orders that one company must go to the frontline and the commander of Vodolaz's company accepts the assignment. The soldiers are ordered to take their gear, food for a day and are told they will have nothing to sleep in there; they will have to occupy foxholes where they can have protection from Russian shells. The location is near the Avdiivka Coke Plant, on the other side of the railway. \n\nA section of machine gunners is brought to the position. The commander of the squad is killed, other soldiers wounded, and there are problems in their evacuation due to incorrect directions. Vodolaz's company asks for \"intelligence\" regarding the area where they are to be deployed, but they are told there is not. At that point the company had a mass mutiny and demanded the removal of the lieutenant colonel. Otherwise, they will ask to join the 3rd Assault Brigade (which is revered by Ukrainian soldiers) en masse. Since the first option did not seem possible, the soldiers took contact with the staff of the 3rd Brigade, which analyzed their applications and replied that it had accepted everyone and they could arrange the transfer. At that point they discovered that the lieutenant colonel had declared them all deserters and their company had been disbanded. The soldiers were transferred to assault detachments of different brigades. Vodolaz was assigned to the 58th Motorized Brigade. The day after arriving he was sent to the \"zero line\" along with other \"refuseniks\". The 58th Motorized Brigade is active between Urozhaine and Novomaiorske in the Velyka Novosilka sector and the very same day he is sent there things became very hot: there was an attack by the 37th Motorized Brigade (36th Army, EMD). Vodolaz's position is attacked by about 30 Russians, along with several armored vehicles. Vodolaz and the other soldiers manage to withstand the assault, despite the fact that the Russian stormtroopers came just a few steps away from their trenches and used many grenades against them. Eventually the Russians had to flee, with human and material losses, while Vodolaz's squad had only one MIA (if I understood correctly) in addition to four wounded. Vodolaz distinguished himself in this action and received a new decoration for bravery (Order for Bravery of Second Class). He disabled at least one Russian armored vehicle with a RPG, and during the fighting he managed to get out of the trench and take magazines and grenades from a dead Russian. Vodolaz praises the brigade's command and the coordination with the artillery.\n\nThere is also another [interview](https://nitter.net/wartranslated/status/1735277933122437356), which in this case Dmtri (WarTranslated) translated with subtitles, with a company commander of the 53rd Mechanized Brigade, active in the southern flank of Avdiivka. This commander talks about how he's always willing to welcome \"refusenik\" from other brigades into his company as he thinks most of them are not bad people or cowards, but need proper guidance and motivation. Some \"refuseniks\" became squad commanders.\n\n\nThese stories make it very clear that a priority of Ukraine for 2024 is to work on the quality of officers. There are of course cases of cowardice on the part of troops, but they are limited, and soldiers like Vodolaz are anything but cowards. They just need to find officers who will allow them to make the most of their potential. Combat orders should be understood by the troops and not totally imposed on them. Maintaining high morale is important, especially given the difficulties with recruiting.",

Gang members from all 3 prisons, #C\u00e1rcel el Inca, C\u00e1rcel #Turi and C\u00e1rcel #Machala had recorded video messages showing prison guards being held hostage, threatening them before later recording their executions. </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, from Monday night to early Tuesday morning the rival gang leader, Fabricio Col\u00f3n Pico, of the \u2018#LosLobos\u2019 gang escaped from the prison C\u00e1rcel #Riobamba. The Los Lobos gang is the main rival of Los Choneros, with fighting between the groups intensifying in recent years.</p>\n\n<p>Multiple car bombs have gone off throughout the country, with one explosion being captured on video. The attack happened on the Highway between the towns of #ElEmpalme and #Quevedo. Who exactly is responsible for the bomb attacks is not entirely clear yet. </p>\n\n<p>The situation is ongoing, we\u2019ll keep you updated on this developing story.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

The Army needed a better way to target Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with man portable air defense missiles (MANPADS). Integration of Stinger with LWCLU was determined to be one of the best ways of improving Stinger performance due to the advanced thermal and optical sensors and the computer and display systems in LWCLU being able to readily accept and display targeting data.*\n\n*In that aspect, the Stinger/LWCLU combination represents almost a quantum leap in technology over the current Stinger setup. Currently, man-portable Stinger teams receive warning of incoming aircraft via voice message over radio, which gives them a heading and approximate distance. The Stinger gunner must manually orient himself towards the oncoming aircraft or drone and then aiming with ironsights at a target. Then the gunner activates the coolant and battery (BCU), which gives him a 45 second window to lock and fire on the target. The gunner is informed via audio tone of the quality of the lock before firing.*\n\n*The LWCLU totally updates that process into what might be the most integrated MANPADS firing interface in development. The Stinger/Lightweight CLU integration kit (SLK) includes a digital compass and a datalink to a soldier\u2019s tactical radio. This radio was an Army provided AN/PRC-163 (which has only been adopted for SOF) in tests, though Raytheon also claims the link is compatible with the current standard issue AN/PRC-152 and 148. This datalink allows the approximate location of a target aircraft or drone to be displayed within the Lightweight CLU display. Arrows inside the display guide the gunner to the proper direction of the contact, using data from an inclinometer and the digital compass. The standard brackets inside the LWCLU used for Javelin firing are also replaced by a colored circle that represents the seeker\u2019s approximate acquisition arc. An estimated \u201cquality of lock\u201d is provided to the Stinger gunner via the color of the circle, with red, amber, and green representing no lock, partial lock, and good lock respectively. This allows the Stinger gunner to judge the quality of lock without wasting precious seconds of BCU activation. IFF interrogation is handled through the standard Stinger system, although IFF data can also be passed through the datalink from radars.*\n\n*Together, the system looks to be incredibly potent. Via datalink cues, the gunner during the system test was able to acquire small UAVs at a range of 5 kilometers. Depending on the target\u2019s aspect and signature, an engagement at that range could be possible, though the Janes release said engagement occurred at 1-2 km during the test. The capability to engage small UAVs with MANPADS at such ranges may prove critical in future conflicts against peer or near-peer opponents, as combat experience in Nagorno-Karabakh proved when infantry teams in trenches were practically at the mercy of the combination of Bayraktar TB2 drones and Harop loitering munitions. With a Stinger/LWCLU combination combined with localized anti-air radars to provide warning and targeting data, an infantry team may be able to effectively employ Stingers against a similar threat combination.*",

        "body": "Mike did another podcast on Ukraine. https://warontherocks.com/2024/01/ukraine-prepares-for-2024/\n\n[Summary of his last talk which I would encourage people to listen to if they haven't already before listening to this new one](https://old.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/18nmi1x/credibledefense_daily_megathread_december_21_2023/kec86uf/). Summary:\n\n\nThe Ukrainian offensive culminated in the fall. The Russian winter offensive is a three pronged attacked. \n\nMain attack in Avdiivka but that has petered out and situation has stabilized tho things aren't done there. \n\nAnother effort in Bakhmut they were able to reclaim some of the territory that was liberated in north, they are trying in the south. \n\nKupiansk is the third axis. \n\nSome progress in Marinka and pressure on Novomykhailivka. \n\nThe reason they are attacking these small cities in Donetsk is because after the very unsuccessful attacks in Vuhledar and the Ukrainian 72nd defended very well and Russian direct attacks failed they are now trying to envelope it and sever GLOCs instead of attacking head on. \n\nLots of attritional fighting and static warfare. Russia has a substantial fires advantage.\n\nUkraine needs 3000 rounds of artillery it's firing 2000 because US aid. Russia has received substantial artillery from North Korea. Russian artillery production is going up next year. \n\nRussia has received and employed short range ballistic missiles and will be used to supplement its own missiles. Russian missile production has increased but they will struggle with ballistic missiles and they are trying to offset with North Korea. He said he's been predicting it for a long time so not a surprise. \n\nRussia is producing its version of Shaheds. Russian missile production rate is not enough to offset all the missiles they used in 2022 and 2023. They are using larger sorties now but this is to be expected. \n\nBut this year it is far less one sided. Ukraine has increased its ability to strike back. Ukraine has the ability to hit infrastructure in Belgorod and Crimea. \n\nUkraine has its version of Shahed and it's probably better in some respects. \n\nUkraine has Crimea in its sight and over time Ukraine can attack Russia far behind the frontline both infrastructure and troops. \n\nThere have been different types of strikes. Publicity strikes that were meant to embarrass Russia and serious military strikes but we will see if they can scale this up. Not a war winning strategy by itself but can make a real impact. \n\nUkraine successful in breaking Black Sea blockade. Russian missile firing vessels mostly intact. Landing ship in dock that destroyed it. \n\nUkraine slowly degrading the Black Sea fleet. Ukrainian shipping up significant. Russia has initiative on the ground but has lost it in naval operations. \n\nIt's one area of competitive advantage that Ukraine can build on this year. Situation has evolved a lot in the last month. \n\nMoscow is reaching out with feelers as Times article highlighted but **its not being done in earnest**. They are still pursuing maximalist war aims. Position is a nonstarter and Putin wants Ukrainian and western capitulation. \n\nThey want to capitalize on the doom and gloom this winter and they want to signal there is another way. \n\n**In practice its clearly not the Russian aim to negotiate.**\n\nIn other conflicts like Syria they have used negotiations to isolate and consolidate new areas they have taken and begin a new phase of war. \n\nIt will just help Russia during a rearmament period. \n\nThe mood in Ukraine while obviously more pessimistic is not despair and its not gloom and doom. \n\nFolks understand it will be a long war and they are looking at what changes they need to do. There is a distinct self awareness of the nature of the problems. **There isn't a desire to negotiate either by folks in Kyiv or the frontline**. \n\nRussian overtures is a tactic. If anything they will expand their aims. 2024 is the Russian window of opportunity.\n\n**But with western help Ukraine could close this window if aid flows thru and Ukraine can rebuild its advantage in 2025. Most importantly Russia faces a great deal of uncertainty after this year.** This is why they are combining a military effort with political effort but only one of those is genuine. \n\nHe thought the first part of Post story on Ukrainian offensive was helpful. \n\nThree main issues from offensive and lessons learned:\n\n1.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Mike did another podcast on Ukraine. <a href=\"https://warontherocks.com/2024/01/ukraine-prepares-for-2024/\">https://warontherocks.com/2024/01/ukraine-prepares-for-2024/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/18nmi1x/credibledefense_daily_megathread_december_21_2023/kec86uf/\">Summary of his last talk which I would encourage people to listen to if they haven&#39;t already before listening to this new one</a>. Summary:</p>\n\n<p>The Ukrainian offensive culminated in the fall. The Russian winter offensive is a three pronged attacked. </p>\n\n<p>Main attack in Avdiivka but that has petered out and situation has stabilized tho things aren&#39;t done there. </p>\n\n<p>Another effort in Bakhmut they were able to reclaim some of the territory that was liberated in north, they are trying in the south. </p>\n\n<p>Kupiansk is the third axis. </p>\n\n<p>Some progress in Marinka and pressure on Novomykhailivka. </p>\n\n<p>The reason they are attacking these small cities in Donetsk is because after the very unsuccessful attacks in Vuhledar and the Ukrainian 72nd defended very well and Russian direct attacks failed they are now trying to envelope it and sever GLOCs instead of attacking head on. </p>\n\n<p>Lots of attritional fighting and static warfare. Russia has a substantial fires advantage.</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine needs 3000 rounds of artillery it&#39;s firing 2000 because US aid. Russia has received substantial artillery from North Korea. Russian artillery production is going up next year. </p>\n\n<p>Russia has received and employed short range ballistic missiles and will be used to supplement its own missiles. Russian missile production has increased but they will struggle with ballistic missiles and they are trying to offset with North Korea. He said he&#39;s been predicting it for a long time so not a surprise. </p>\n\n<p>Russia is producing its version of Shaheds. Russian missile production rate is not enough to offset all the missiles they used in 2022 and 2023. They are using larger sorties now but this is to be expected. </p>\n\n<p>But this year it is far less one sided. Ukraine has increased its ability to strike back. Ukraine has the ability to hit infrastructure in Belgorod and Crimea. </p>\n\n<p>Ukraine has its version of Shahed and it&#39;s probably better in some respects. </p>\n\n<p>Ukraine has Crimea in its sight and over time Ukraine can attack Russia far behind the frontline both infrastructure and troops. </p>\n\n<p>There have been different types of strikes. Publicity strikes that were meant to embarrass Russia and serious military strikes but we will see if they can scale this up. Not a war winning strategy by itself but can make a real impact. </p>\n\n<p>Ukraine successful in breaking Black Sea blockade. Russian missile firing vessels mostly intact. Landing ship in dock that destroyed it. </p>\n\n<p>Ukraine slowly degrading the Black Sea fleet. Ukrainian shipping up significant. Russia has initiative on the ground but has lost it in naval operations. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s one area of competitive advantage that Ukraine can build on this year. Situation has evolved a lot in the last month. </p>\n\n<p>Moscow is reaching out with feelers as Times article highlighted but <strong>its not being done in earnest</strong>. They are still pursuing maximalist war aims. Position is a nonstarter and Putin wants Ukrainian and western capitulation. </p>\n\n<p>They want to capitalize on the doom and gloom this winter and they want to signal there is another way. </p>\n\n<p><strong>In practice its clearly not the Russian aim to negotiate.</strong></p>\n\n<p>In other conflicts like Syria they have used negotiations to isolate and consolidate new areas they have taken and begin a new phase of war. </p>\n\n<p>It will just help Russia during a rearmament period. </p>\n\n<p>The mood in Ukraine while obviously more pessimistic is not despair and its not gloom and doom. </p>\n\n<p>Folks understand it will be a long war and they are looking at what changes they need to do. There is a distinct self awareness of the nature of the problems. <strong>There isn&#39;t a desire to negotiate either by folks in Kyiv or the frontline</strong>. </p>\n\n<p>Russian overtures is a tactic. If anything they will expand their aims. 2024 is the Russian window of opportunity.</p>\n\n<p><strong>But with western help Ukraine could close this window if aid flows thru and Ukraine can rebuild its advantage in 2025. Most importantly Russia faces a great deal of uncertainty after this year.</strong> This is why they are combining a military effort with political effort but only one of those is genuine. </p>\n\n<p>He thought the first part of Post story on Ukrainian offensive was helpful. </p>\n\n<p>Three main issues from offensive and lessons learned:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Ukraine needs to be provided a decisive fires advantage. Ukraine lacked this in the 2023. Artillery barrages to cause attrition is the only way to enable maneuver in this war. </li>\n<li>We need to significantly revisit training. Operating at a rate of 2 companies per Brigade isn&#39;t going to sufficient. If Ukraine can get a fires advantage then they need to operate at a Brigade level to exploit an opening. </li>\n<li>Against prepared defensive you need enablers. Things like mine clearing, breaching equipment and SHORAD. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In this war things evolve very quickly. FPVs were not the principal challenge in June during Ukraine&#39;s offensive. We need to talk about how to deal with FPVs and EW. </p>\n\n<p>Planning for the 2025 offensive means planning for the battlefield evolution. </p>\n\n<p>Doesn&#39;t think training was the foremost reason the offensive failed but a combination of all three factors. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Biggest takeaway from 2023 should not be the nuances or details on tactics. Alignment of strategy and resource constraints should be the main effort going forward. We need to stop thinking in 6 month increments and more long term 18 month increments. Unity of effort has to evolve.</strong></p>\n</div>",

This topic comes up occasionally when US Generals talk details about training programs.  It is a big difference in mindset. Interesting to see what kind of Ukrainian hybrid evolves.</p>\n</div>",

In the early days of the war, many Chernihiv residents hoped to sit out the shelling by moving there.\n\n\"But by the end of February, their convoys started passing through the village,\" recalls Vladimir. \"Our tanks initially stood at the crossroads - and fought back as best they could. But it was an uneven fight, and by early March the Russians had already entered the village centre.\"\n\nThroughout their attempt to advance on Kyiv, enemy columns passed through Mikhaylo-Kotsyubynske.\n\n\"When their armoured columns get struck, they immediately search all the villages for anyone who could be passing on grid references,\" says Vladimir. \"On March 4, they started searching in our village, going from house to house, interrogating people. Then they came to us.\"\n\nAt that moment, shelling began.\n\n\"More than a dozen soldiers packed the basement alongside members of my family, seeking shelter from the shellfire,\" says Vladimir. Nestled between sacks of potatoes, the Russians gave a lesson in political propaganda: \u201c\u2019We have come to liberate you, to free you from your government.

He confiscated their phones, went out to take a look at them, and quickly returned. Vladimir, Nikita, and their mother were immediately led onto the street.\n\n\"They started shouting at us, saying we were passing on grid references.

Spending in December 2023 was more than 5 trillion RUB, causing most of the deficit.\n\n>The \"underlying\" budget deficit was actually ~3% of GDP: At the end of 2022, Russia prepaid social spending of ~1% of GDP.

Total spending in 2023 was 32.4 trillion RUB, total revenues 28.9 trillion.\n\n>Looking at total spending, it is also possible to estimate Russian defense spending a bit better. It was most likely RUB 7-7.5 trillion in 2023, or 50% more than originally planned in the budget law. Additional war spending was added in other budget categories.\n\nA yearly deficit of 3% of GDP isn't that bad - provided that the country can easily borrow money. This is obviously not the case for Russia.\n\nFurthermore, Russia's main income comes from oil exports in dollars. The ruble crashed hard last year, essentially increasing Russia's income in rubles, and yet that still wasn't enough.\n\nWe will likely see an even weaker ruble this year, combined with increased taxes and eventually decreased spending somewhere. If oil prices stay at current levels, Russia will be in some serious trouble (as it assumes Brent to trade at $85 per barrel in 2024).\n\nPutin's meeting with MBS was probably mostly about oil production policies.

My question is how(or if) this assault was different from past attempts at Vuhlnedar, etc. on first the offensive side and the defensive side? E.g., did Russia adapt tactics, is Ukraine using new concepts for defense, etc.\n\nThe problems both sides possess attempting massed armored breakthroughs, as in breaching, plus assault, plus exploitation, largely comes down to drone threat, plus old fashioned defensive capabilities plus offensive specific incompetence among tactical level command and staff officers, likely with a mix of issues relating to unsecured communications further hampered by EW. \n\nSimply put, they don't have solutions to the tactical problems that would allow them to assemble large armored formations of company and higher into columns many kilometers back from the front lines, then conduct their road march in column, breach the minefield, conduct the assault, defeat the inevitable counterattack, and then have the ability to continue the attack or allow a passage of lines of a second echelon force doing everything previously mentioned above. \n\nThey're getting caught in the open, in column formation, by drones, ATGM operators, helicopters, etc, and getting chewed up on the approach or as they are trying to breach the minefields. For the small number of assault units who actually make it to their objective or through it, they are too open, they cannot hide their vehicles from the ever present drones who either direct PGM arty strikes, dumb arty fire missions, or coordinate with FPV drone units, who are becoming more prevalent and more skilled every month. \n\nThe much less risky attack involves a primarily dismounted infantry assault. These are not only often supported by small numbers of tanks, APC, or IFV who can disperse and hide near the front lines, allowing a short jump off with surprise and easier time disappearing back to their hide site when enemy drones appear, but those small units, often sub-platoon or even just a squad, are much easier for overextended battalion and especially brigade/regimental command and staff's to coordinate. \n\nNote, UAF and Russian battalion level command and staff were deliberately designed to be small and not set up for any sort of strenuous planning, they basically just execute battle drills and coordinate fires and logistics). \n\nThis means that UAF and Russian \"storm detachments,\" using a system both sides literally copied from WW2 era Red Army manuals, might only have 1-2 infantry squads acting as the main effort, but they are supported by an armor platoon, plus all the fires and other enablers that would normally go to a company or company plus sized mechanized assault. \n\nWhile it seems counterintuitive that in the highly lethal battlefield of the 21st century that infantry would have better survivability than armor, they don't. They still get wrecked regularly. But they're easier to replace, cheaper, more of them, and they do have a few tactical advantages that the mechanized assaults don't have.\n\nFor example, they often don't need to start out from many kilometers away, they often have less than a kilometer or so from their jump off position to the objective. That gives them surprise when they attack. Even when they must travel further, because they have smaller profiles and less intense heat signatures, there is less chance that random ISR drones will catch them during their movement (if they do, they usually take heavy losses). And if they plan their assault well, the actual trench clearing is often not too challenging as most of the work was done by supporting enablers beforehand, so a mix of suppression or neutralizing fires, enemy casualties and panic, and surprise when the dismounted assault starts, allows them to quickly close with and overrun a roughly fireteam or squad sized enemy trench system, killing or capturing the occupants and then often manning it themselves to ready for a counterattack. \n\nBecause of the positional aspect of the war at the moment, these tactics allows local tactical commanders to plan out set piece combined arms operations to launch these dismounted infantry assaults meant for incremental gains.  However, that's the rub.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>We&#39;ve established that offensive attacks have moved towards dispersed infantry because of how difficult it is to mass armor and use it with the proliferation of high quality intel and defensive tools like FPV drones and guided artillery. We saw Russia try a new armored assault on Avdviika recently. My question is how(or if) this assault was different from past attempts at Vuhlnedar, etc. on first the offensive side and the defensive side? E.g., did Russia adapt tactics, is Ukraine using new concepts for defense, etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The problems both sides possess attempting massed armored breakthroughs, as in breaching, plus assault, plus exploitation, largely comes down to drone threat, plus old fashioned defensive capabilities plus offensive specific incompetence among tactical level command and staff officers, likely with a mix of issues relating to unsecured communications further hampered by EW. </p>\n\n<p>Simply put, they don&#39;t have solutions to the tactical problems that would allow them to assemble large armored formations of company and higher into columns many kilometers back from the front lines, then conduct their road march in column, breach the minefield, conduct the assault, defeat the inevitable counterattack, and then have the ability to continue the attack or allow a passage of lines of a second echelon force doing everything previously mentioned above. </p>\n\n<p>They&#39;re getting caught in the open, in column formation, by drones, ATGM operators, helicopters, etc, and getting chewed up on the approach or as they are trying to breach the minefields. For the small number of assault units who actually make it to their objective or through it, they are too open, they cannot hide their vehicles from the ever present drones who either direct PGM arty strikes, dumb arty fire missions, or coordinate with FPV drone units, who are becoming more prevalent and more skilled every month. </p>\n\n<p>The much less risky attack involves a primarily dismounted infantry assault. These are not only often supported by small numbers of tanks, APC, or IFV who can disperse and hide near the front lines, allowing a short jump off with surprise and easier time disappearing back to their hide site when enemy drones appear, but those small units, often sub-platoon or even just a squad, are much easier for overextended battalion and especially brigade/regimental command and staff&#39;s to coordinate. </p>\n\n<p>Note, UAF and Russian battalion level command and staff were deliberately designed to be small and not set up for any sort of strenuous planning, they basically just execute battle drills and coordinate fires and logistics). </p>\n\n<p>This means that UAF and Russian &quot;storm detachments,&quot; using a system both sides literally copied from WW2 era Red Army manuals, might only have 1-2 infantry squads acting as the main effort, but they are supported by an armor platoon, plus all the fires and other enablers that would normally go to a company or company plus sized mechanized assault. </p>\n\n<p>While it seems counterintuitive that in the highly lethal battlefield of the 21st century that infantry would have better survivability than armor, they don&#39;t. They still get wrecked regularly. But they&#39;re easier to replace, cheaper, more of them, and they do have a few tactical advantages that the mechanized assaults don&#39;t have.</p>\n\n<p>For example, they often don&#39;t need to start out from many kilometers away, they often have less than a kilometer or so from their jump off position to the objective. That gives them surprise when they attack. Even when they must travel further, because they have smaller profiles and less intense heat signatures, there is less chance that random ISR drones will catch them during their movement (if they do, they usually take heavy losses). And if they plan their assault well, the actual trench clearing is often not too challenging as most of the work was done by supporting enablers beforehand, so a mix of suppression or neutralizing fires, enemy casualties and panic, and surprise when the dismounted assault starts, allows them to quickly close with and overrun a roughly fireteam or squad sized enemy trench system, killing or capturing the occupants and then often manning it themselves to ready for a counterattack. </p>\n\n<p>Because of the positional aspect of the war at the moment, these tactics allows local tactical commanders to plan out set piece combined arms operations to launch these dismounted infantry assaults meant for incremental gains.  However, that&#39;s the rub. There is no way they can accomplish more with those attacks than take an individual small unit objective. </p>\n\n<p>Basically, anything larger than an enemy squad-sized objective requires a larger assault force, but as soon as they try to enlarge these operations or coordinate with other units, shit falls apart because they&#39;re easier to spot (and engage) or because of faults with competence relating to planning highly coordinated and synchronized operations.  </p>\n\n<p>Because it would be impossible to attain their larger tactical objectives and thus their minimalist strategic goals using these tactics, they must attempt larger scale operations. </p>\n\n<p>The Ukrainians failed initially during the early days of their offensive in June, but tried again here and there with company and even battalion sized mechanized attacks through July and August, most of them failing.

Both Russia and Ukraine largely rely on unsecure, open channel radios at the battalion level and under, which can be listened on, very easily jammed, and triangulated. Not only can the enemy jam them, but friendly EW can also easily jam them. Frequency hopping radios are harder to jam, which means we could more freely use our EW than they could without worry of command fratricide to the degree they do.\n\nAdditionally, our higher tactical level leadership don't micromanage the fight like both Ukraine and Russia are both reported to do. For example, due to deliberate design, Russian and Ukraine battalion level staffs are tiny and not well trained because they don't need to be, they execute battle drills, coordinate fires and do logistics. Brigade and regimental level staffs are supposed to do all the planning, but in this war they're overwhelmed and undertrained. The Ukrainians are noted to be bypassing the battalion leadership during offensive ops and having the brigade commander run individual companies, but only 2-3 at a time because anything more overwhelms them.\n\nMaking it easier to overwhelm them, both sides are very over reliant on their own drones, not only for ISR but also Recon Fires Complex. That's because the artillery and FPV drone groups are directly attached to those levels of commands, the ISR drones that are plugged into the Bde/Regt command posts instantly relay fire missions as soon as they find targets, and they're always looking for them.\n\nBut are they willing to not use drones during an attack if it means they can deny the enemy them too? I don't think either Russian or Ukrainian leaders will. Bde/Regt commanders are directing the fights from 10-15 km to the rear by way of unsecure radios and drone footage. They can't turn on effective EW without jamming their own radios and downing their own drones. They can't turn on SHORAD even if they had it without downing their own drones. \nL\n\nSmoke for obscuration is another example. A cornerstone to offensive warfare, from the infantry squad level to large scale brigade level combined arms beaching operations, smoke is supposed to be used to obscure. Why aren't we seeing it used almost ever in this war? I've been wondering that the whole war. RUSI wrote over the summer, having embedded with a UAF brigade during the counteroffensive and interviewing many others, only 3% of shells used are smoke, most UAF commanders don't like using them because then they can't see well with their own drones, limiting their command and control abilities and their abilities to direct fire. \n\nUS Army commanders are less reliant on drones. Our company commanders are much better than their Ukrainian and Russian counterparts, our battalion command and staff are much better too than counterparts, and our brigade commanders are specifically trained not to try to micromanage war like it's a RTS game even if they can.\n\nThat said, having served in them, the US military is far from perfect, we screw up operations constantly, and MANY past conflicts would have gone much differently if air support didn't show up to save the day. So while we're theoretically better able to perform those missions, there is a good chance we'd have some major screwups too leading to heavy and embarrassing losses, especially if we didn't have air superiority.\n\nThough I am thinking we would have that if we actually did throw down conventionally with Russia, at least locally and at the times we were conducting offensive ops.",

I don&#39;t think either Russian or Ukrainian leaders will. Bde/Regt commanders are directing the fights from 10-15 km to the rear by way of unsecure radios and drone footage. They can&#39;t turn on effective EW without jamming their own radios and downing their own drones. They can&#39;t turn on SHORAD even if they had it without downing their own drones. \nL</p>\n\n<p>Smoke for obscuration is another example. A cornerstone to offensive warfare, from the infantry squad level to large scale brigade level combined arms beaching operations, smoke is supposed to be used to obscure. Why aren&#39;t we seeing it used almost ever in this war? I&#39;ve been wondering that the whole war. RUSI wrote over the summer, having embedded with a UAF brigade during the counteroffensive and interviewing many others, only 3% of shells used are smoke, most UAF commanders don&#39;t like using them because then they can&#39;t see well with their own drones, limiting their command and control abilities and their abilities to direct fire. </p>\n\n<p>US Army commanders are less reliant on drones. Our company commanders are much better than their Ukrainian and Russian counterparts, our battalion command and staff are much better too than counterparts, and our brigade commanders are specifically trained not to try to micromanage war like it&#39;s a RTS game even if they can.</p>\n\n<p>That said, having served in them, the US military is far from perfect, we screw up operations constantly, and MANY past conflicts would have gone much differently if air support didn&#39;t show up to save the day. So while we&#39;re theoretically better able to perform those missions, there is a good chance we&#39;d have some major screwups too leading to heavy and embarrassing losses, especially if we didn&#39;t have air superiority.</p>\n\n<p>Though I am thinking we would have that if we actually did throw down conventionally with Russia, at least locally and at the times we were conducting offensive ops.</p>\n</div>",

Only the most SE part of Avdiivka itself was on the old JFO line, the flanking areas were taken by Russian since the war started, with the entire northern flank taken in early 2023. So most of the defenses are fresh, built since last spring at the earliest. So it's not that strong.\n\nIn terms of massed mechanized attacks, that would have been critical to successfully encircling that salient, as that's the only way to rapidly penetrate the existing front line positions, have the strength to defeat counterattacks, meet up with concentric drives needing to cross about 11 kilometers to seal the cauldron.\n\nBut easier said than done, and that's where the issue is. Top generals like Gerasimov are issuing orders and applying pressure to tactical leaders who don't have the ability to conduct successful mechanized breaching operations, a mix of tactical and technical limitations regarding enemy drones especially, but a large part is competence related.\n\nSo the first attack fails. Do they stop? Would a former Soviet tank officer, someone whose entire military service up until making general was based on Cold War armor theory about mass and echeloned attacks and acceptance of losses eventually leading to success, going to allow the local tactical commanders to call it quits because it failed the first time?

Well, their entire professional career is telling them yes, the breakthrough will happen if they keep up the pressure \n\nThe top Ukrainian generals were doing the same thing all summer and fall because they too graduated the same exact schools as Gerasimov et al become junior lieutenants and were reading the same books, promoting the same doctrine until at least 2014, with much of UAF doctrine still being much closer to Russian than Western NATO.",

The tank losses are reported as 886, compared to the [Russian official claim of 1,530](https://www.eurasiantimes.com/russia-added-1500-mbts-to-fight-nato-backed-ukraine/) and [Latvian MoD reports of 1,200-1,800](https://english.nv.ua/nation/russia-can-produce-and-repair-100-150-tanks-per-month-latvian-defense-ministry-50376288.html), being sent to the front in 2023.\n\nAs for the IFVs (1,520 visually confirmed lost in 2023), I don't think anybody bothered to go through hundreds of various BMP-1, BMP-2, MT-LB etc versions being pulled out of storage sites, but the figure for production of new BMP-3s that is often mentioned is [400 per year](https://uatv.ua/en/shoigu-showed-the-system-of-tanks-the-russian-army-loses-such-a-number-in-a-week-on-average-an-analyst-about-the-limit-of-the-capabilities-of-the-russian-military-industrial-complex/).\n\nEdit: just to add that Shoigu mentioned, in the same statement as 1,530 tanks, that they delivered [\"2,518 infantry fighting vehicles and armoured personnel carriers\u201d](https://www.eurasiantimes.com/russia-added-1500-mbts-to-fight-nato-backed-ukraine/)  to the troops in 2023. That gives us the absolute upper limit of the range, as I don't think Shoigu would downplay the number.\n\nAll in all, in 2023 Russia probably managed to produce enough \"traditional\" military systems to cover the losses and leave its armed forces with a considerable surplus. Is this surplus sufficient to cover the deficit from 2022 and the needs of newly formed units throughout 2023? Probably not.\n\nAdditionally, the production/attrition of \"non-traditional\" military systems (observation drones, kamikazes, FPVs) is playing a vital part in this war - and here we have no reliable estimates of how Ukraine's and Russia's productions compare.
