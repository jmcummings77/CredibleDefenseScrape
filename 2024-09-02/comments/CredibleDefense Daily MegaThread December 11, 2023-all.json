                "body": "Edit: I'm asking about a different article than the one linked by the OP:\n\n[Miscalculations, divisions marked offensive planning by U.S., Ukraine](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/04/ukraine-counteroffensive-us-planning-russia-war/)\n\nThat you linked a [bit below](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/18fu0yb/comment/kd0ud3z/).\n\n---\n\nWhere did you get the notion of 'hype' and 'feeding the simulation c\\*ap about the low resistance, morale and combat value of Russian troops'?\n\nCan you quote a line or a paragraph in the article that implies any of that?\n\nWhy does it say this instead?\n\n> Ukrainian officials hoped the offensive could re-create the success of the fall of 2022, when they recovered parts of the Kharkiv region in the northeast and the city of Kherson in the south in a campaign that surprised even Ukraine\u2019s biggest backers. **Again, their focus would be in more than one place.**\n\n> But Western officials said the **war games affirmed their assessment that Ukraine would be best served by concentrating its forces on a single strategic objective** \u2014 a massed attack through Russian-held areas to the Sea of Azov, severing the Kremlin\u2019s land route from Russia to Crimea, a critical supply line.\n\n> **The rehearsals gave the United States the opportunity to say at several points to the Ukrainians, \u201cI know you really, really, really want to do this, but it\u2019s not going to work,\u201d one former U.S. official said.**\n\n> At the end of the day, though, it would be Zelensky, Zaluzhny and other Ukrainian leaders who would make the decision, the former official noted.\nOfficials tried to assign probabilities to different scenarios, **including a Russian capitulation \u2014 deemed a \u201creally low likelihood\u201d** \u2014 or a major Ukrainian setback that would create an opening for a major Russian counterattack \u2014 also a slim probability.\n\nor this:\n\n> \u201cYou are not going to go from an emerging, post-Soviet legacy military to the U.S. Army of 2023 overnight,\u201d a senior Western intelligence official said. \u201cIt is foolish for some to expect that you can give them things and it changes the way they fight.\u201d\n\n> U.S. military officials did not dispute that it would be a bloody struggle. By early 2023, they knew that as many as 130,000 Ukrainian troops had been injured or killed in the war, including many of the country\u2019s best soldiers. **Some Ukrainian commanders were already expressing doubts about the coming campaign, citing the numbers of troops who lacked battlefield experience.**\n\nor this:\n\n> \u201cIn a perfect world, you get a choice.

By early 2023, they knew that as many as 130,000 Ukrainian troops had been injured or killed in the war, including many of the country\u2019s best soldiers. <strong>Some Ukrainian commanders were already expressing doubts about the coming campaign, citing the numbers of troops who lacked battlefield experience.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>or this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cIn a perfect world, you get a choice. You keep saying, \u2018I want to take six more months to train up and feel comfortable about this,\u2019\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cMy take is that they didn\u2019t have a choice.

Disappointing but hardly surprising. They have, more or less, won. The Brotherhood has achieved its objectives and secured effective control over most of Shan State, with particular focus on their respective ethnic areas. Remaining military forces are in disarray and the junta is fighting too many fires to realistically spare the reinforcements they'd need to regain control. So now they're sitting down to negotiate some kind of settlement, which is ongoing but has already gotten unspecified \"positive results\" [according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry](https://www.barrons.com/news/china-says-positive-peace-talks-held-over-north-myanmar-conflict-9e1de772). Most likely the junta will simply cede control to the local groups and retreat, politically recognizing the reality on the ground in exchange for freeing up its forces to reinforce other fronts. It should be noted that this state of affairs is hardly unprecedented; the MNDAA held Kokang until 2009, for example, until the Tatmadaw drove them out and replaced them with the Kokang BGF. The MNDAA unsuccessfully attempted to regain control in 2015, but now it looks like they'll finally be back. Similar trajectories apply to the other groups; the central government asserts more control when it is strong and cedes control when it is weak, and this dynamic predates the 2021 coup by decades. \n\nUnfortunately, this is a major blow to the remaining anti-junta forces who have not achieved their own objectives. The Brotherhood groups are quite competent (by Myanmar standards) and the fact that they are now saying \"I got mine\" and bowing out places far more pressure on those still fighting. 1027 was, after all, what kicked off the recent gains by resistance forces, before which the conflict was [pretty much a stalemate](https://thediplomat.com/2023/04/2-years-of-turmoil-myanmars-grinding-stalemate/). Whether the situation will be any different going forwards is an open question.

Resistance to the junta has never been a unified effort, but rather a messy patchwork of factions each battling the Tatmadaw for their own selfish reasons.

A complete toppling of the junta is the objective of some groups, but others view any central government with deep suspicion (with historical justification, mind you). Those cracks can be papered over so long as everyone is struggling together, but something like this was always likely to happen once the junta started losing ground. \n\nIn short, this is a big win for the Brotherhood groups (and their collective patron, China).

Summary below.\n\n**Avdiivka**: Believes Russia has more or less \"peaked\", which I read as culmination. Russia has lost too much equipment to field more, and infantry appear to have lost morale. AFU logistics are increasingly stressed by drones. Either a counterattack or EW is needed to solve the problem.\n\n**Mar'inka**: Likely about to fall. Russians could develop an attainable operational goal to force Vuhledar defenders to retreat. This has operational significance as Russians could restore the Donetsk-Volnovakha rail.\n\n**Bakhmut**: Some erasure of AFU gains is now expected. Doesn't expect lines to break or collapse. I take this to mean that AFU may retreat to hold the heights west of Klishchiivka, and to let Khromove fall.\n\n**Spirne**: The wide AFU salient appears stable.\n\n**Lyman and Kupyansk**: Both axes appear to be secondary goals for Russia. They are taking significant casualties without gain. No changes expected.\n\n**Overall**: Shell hunger is real, but not expected to result in collapse of lines anytime soon. Russia probably doesn't have the ability to do another army-level assault as in Avdiivka. He believes Russia can reverse some of their losses from the AFU summer offensive on a tactical level, but judges it unlikely to succeed operationally or strategically. Lays significant blame on West for the lack of promised ammo.\n\n**My take**: I think this confirms that drones are fulfilling a role similar to artillery in stopping offensive action. Ukraine in 2022 would be in a state of collapse if they used artillery as sparingly as they do now. Drones can functionally act to replace artillery in some circumstances, so long as EW isn't too extensive, and can do it significantly cheaper. Targeting infantry with drones appears to lead to significant morale problems. It's a bad time to be a grunt.\n\nBradleys seem effective for the maneuver defense Ukraine has been employing. Russia has made it to Stepove and near the coke plant numerous times. They force AFU garrisons to retreat, only to be removed by Bushmaster 25mm autocannons from a mile away. AFU then return to their original positions. I hope AFU gets a thousand more of these things.",

Russians could develop an attainable operational goal to force Vuhledar defenders to retreat. This has operational significance as Russians could restore the Donetsk-Volnovakha rail.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bakhmut</strong>: Some erasure of AFU gains is now expected. Doesn&#39;t expect lines to break or collapse. I take this to mean that AFU may retreat to hold the heights west of Klishchiivka, and to let Khromove fall.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Spirne</strong>: The wide AFU salient appears stable.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lyman and Kupyansk</strong>: Both axes appear to be secondary goals for Russia. They are taking significant casualties without gain. No changes expected.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Overall</strong>: Shell hunger is real, but not expected to result in collapse of lines anytime soon. Russia probably doesn&#39;t have the ability to do another army-level assault as in Avdiivka. He believes Russia can reverse some of their losses from the AFU summer offensive on a tactical level, but judges it unlikely to succeed operationally or strategically. Lays significant blame on West for the lack of promised ammo.</p>\n\n<p><strong>My take</strong>: I think this confirms that drones are fulfilling a role similar to artillery in stopping offensive action. Ukraine in 2022 would be in a state of collapse if they used artillery as sparingly as they do now. Drones can functionally act to replace artillery in some circumstances, so long as EW isn&#39;t too extensive, and can do it significantly cheaper. Targeting infantry with drones appears to lead to significant morale problems. It&#39;s a bad time to be a grunt.</p>\n\n<p>Bradleys seem effective for the maneuver defense Ukraine has been employing. Russia has made it to Stepove and near the coke plant numerous times. They force AFU garrisons to retreat, only to be removed by Bushmaster 25mm autocannons from a mile away. AFU then return to their original positions. I hope AFU gets a thousand more of these things.</p>\n</div>",

                "body": "The variable that we are probably not getting a clear picture of yet is Russian morale. Having exhausted their equipment supplies, they've devolved to infantry attacks, and now there are some reports (including from the Tatarigami thread linked above and from ISW yesterday) that the remaining Russian infantry in the AO may be refusing or unable to continue even those dismounted attacks.\n\nI don't think that necessarily means straight-up mutinies are happening or anything so extreme or dramatic, it's possible the Russian units that have been fighting there are simply so completely exhausted that it is visible even to their frequently less-than-emotionally-supportive officers. At some point after enough time in combat under stress, everyone, no matter how tough, hits a wall where they simply cannot function at all anymore without significant rest. And by cannot function, I mean even at the very low level required to participate in suicidal meat wave assaults. People in that state are like shambling, zoned out zombies because they are in a state of extreme and persistent shock likely exacerbated by extensive CTEs from intense bombardment with artillery or whatever type of ordnance. Even just 25mm HEI rounds knocking on someone's trench door will rattle their brain around in their skull pretty fiercely, never mind the kind of vibrations you get from a full tube or rocket artillery barrage. And if the attrition has been severe enough, there are likely insufficient surviving formal or informal leaders capable of organizing any kind of coordinated group activity.\n\nRegardless of whether any such incapacity is manifesting via mutiny, complete collapse in function, something in between those two extremes, or something else entirely, the reports of how horrific the Russian personnel losses have been around Avdiivka make it easy to believe they are unable to continue fighting at this point. Russian equipment losses tapering off first followed by a slower decline in estimated RuAF personnel losses also supports this interpretation, because it suggests (in combination with all the reports to this effect) they ran out of equipment first, then attempted dismounted assaults, and now the losses from the dismounted assaults are declining too because they cannot resource them anymore. The only other explanation that fits that pattern of losses would be if their losses declined not because of reduced effort but because of greater battlefield success. Yet the marked silence on Avdiivka of the Russian propaganda machine, which typically trumpets even the most minor or illusory of Russian successes as far and widely as possible, in combination with no lasting or significant Russian territorial gains, suggests that is not the case.\n\nIn any case, this slow tapering off of efforts is certainly what culmination typically looks like when observed in the moment without the benefit of significant elapsed time to provide hindsight. Without that time, we can't really know whether we are seeing a logistical reset between different waves of an ongoing offensive rather than a final culmination of the overall offensive.\n\nSince the end of offensives aren't generally announced and they tend to taper off quietly, it's almost always impossible to distinguish between culmination of one wave of an offensive versus culmination of the entire offensive effort until well after the battle has actually concluded, because breaks in the fighting can happen at unpredictable intervals and can last for unpredictable lengths of time without the overall offensive necessarily having fully culminated. The Battle of Bakhmut has been ongoing for 16 months, and it wouldn't be unreasonable to claim that both sides have culminated there repeatedly over that period. Or to claim that neither side has, because they continue to fight over the same area to this day. Or that the battle is actually two battles, one ending in May 2022 and the other starting in October 2022 and lasting through today. Or three, with the second ending when Wagner withdrew and the third beginning when Ukraine began to counter-attack in the spring.\n\nBasically, it's not clear how long of a break between offensive actions is required for the subsequent action to start counting as a wholly separate battle. At some point, it's just arbitrary semantic arguments about where you draw the line between culmination of a suboperation of an offensive and culmination of the entire offensive itself, and how long a break in the fighting is required for a renewed offensive to no longer count as part of the original operation. The ultimate problem can't be escaped: we are attempting to identify the final inflection point on a curve generated by an ongoing time series function that can potentially output an unbounded number of inflection points as we proceed into the future. It isn't even especially unlikely that the function will do so and do so frequently as the advantage has been swinging back and forth unpredictably between the two belligerents in the battle for Avdiivka and may continue to do so.\n\nIssues of conceptual precision aside, I think we can at a minimum safely say that the actions that roughly constituted the most recent wave of the Avdiivka offensive have probably culminated. Which, if that is the final Russian Avdiivka offensive action, represents the final culmination of the entire operation. We can of course only wait to see whether there will be subsequent waves or if this is it for now.\n\nThat said, a week is a long time for a logistical reset for an offensive force that is partially attrited but has not culminated and instead is actively prepping to renew the attack. It's more than enough time to rebuild stocks of ammo, bring in reinforcements from reserves, and let the assaulting forces get some rest without losing their edge. Anything longer than a week starts to risk losing the initiative and thus the offensive's momentum, resulting in culmination anyway. And if the available troops need more rest than a week, then it's probably fair to infer those units have culminated for all practical purposes. If no reserves are brought in to replace or relieve these attrited units in a timely manner, it's probably fair to assume the entire offensive has culminated, at least for the foreseeable future.",

When he pre-recorded his SMO TV address, everything seemed to be proceeding as planned. The plan: the military column 'V', which entered Ukraine from Belarus around 5:00 AM from the North and was heading towards Kyiv, included civilian [administrative personnel driving civilian cars](https://imgur.com/IYv0iKl). They were intended to take over the Ukrainian government on that very day, February 24th. The Russian military had informed them to expect entry into Kyiv by around 13:00 on February 24th, 2022. They were traveling light, equipped for what was anticipated to be a brief, uneventful drive to Kyiv. It's almost certain that Putin was feeling confident as he pre-recorded his address \\*before\\* the actual invasion.\n\nWhat I mean to say is that in the days and weeks that followed, he was far from being triumphant or confident.\n\n> What makes you think that? Also as I said previously, we are talking about a democracy here. Which means that the \"best interest\" is a highly questionable concept here.\n\nI don't intend to straw man your argument, but it appears to reflect a structural perspective akin to the notion that democracies, being inherently messy, are incapable of articulating or pursuing their national strategic interests. My point is that a prolonged war or a bloody stalemate in Ukraine might align well with US strategic interests. Thus GOP is free to obstruct and hinder Biden. This is also might be why we cannot realistically expect the US to support Ukraine to the extent that it fully restores its territorial integrity. (For the record, I think that to be a mistake; the right course of action is to support Ukraine in expelling Russian invaders from its territory \\*at least\\* to status quo ante bellum of Feb 23, 2022).",
                            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>In a video where he declares &quot;SMO&quot; he sounds quite confident to me. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sure, that&#39;s because at that time, he was unaware of the extent of his mess. When he pre-recorded his SMO TV address, everything seemed to be proceeding as planned. The plan: the military column &#39;V&#39;, which entered Ukraine from Belarus around 5:00 AM from the North and was heading towards Kyiv, included civilian <a href=\"https://imgur.com/IYv0iKl\">administrative personnel driving civilian cars</a>. They were intended to take over the Ukrainian government on that very day, February 24th. The Russian military had informed them to expect entry into Kyiv by around 13:00 on February 24th, 2022. They were traveling light, equipped for what was anticipated to be a brief, uneventful drive to Kyiv. It&#39;s almost certain that Putin was feeling confident as he pre-recorded his address *before* the actual invasion.</p>\n\n<p>What I mean to say is that in the days and weeks that followed, he was far from being triumphant or confident.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>What makes you think that? Also as I said previously, we are talking about a democracy here. Which means that the &quot;best interest&quot; is a highly questionable concept here.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t intend to straw man your argument, but it appears to reflect a structural perspective akin to the notion that democracies, being inherently messy, are incapable of articulating or pursuing their national strategic interests. My point is that a prolonged war or a bloody stalemate in Ukraine might align well with US strategic interests. Thus GOP is free to obstruct and hinder Biden. This is also might be why we cannot realistically expect the US to support Ukraine to the extent that it fully restores its territorial integrity. (For the record, I think that to be a mistake; the right course of action is to support Ukraine in expelling Russian invaders from its territory *at least* to status quo ante bellum of Feb 23, 2022).</p>\n</div>",

Stronger defences without losing more territory. Meanwhile, they will increase their weapons and ammunition reserves and prepare troops for future operations. This strategy, according to US officials, assuming that Ukrainian forces can successfully defend against future Russian attacks, could lead to a convincing force being prepared by Kiev with Western assistance by the end of 2024, forcing the Russians to enter into compromised peace talks either in late 2024 or during 2025.\n\nAccording to the NYT, however, Kiev argues that Ukraine needs symbolic victories, and for this they are studying the practice of this year's deep strikes. They do not rule out that, in addition to defensive strikes, they will try to launch deep strikes on Russian territory: against ammunition and weapons factories and logistics centres. According to the US newspaper, the new 2024 strategy could be finalised by the end of January, after a series of combat simulations in Wiesbaden, Germany.  \nThis, incidentally, correlates with the Ukrainian leadership's announcement about a week and a half ago: after the General Staff talks, Zelensky announced that the focus in the coming months would be on building new lines of defence in the north and east of the country.   \nThere are logical elements to this outlined strategy, but it also gives Russia time to prepare and strengthen its positions in the occupied Ukrainian territories, and not least time to pacify and integrate the occupied territories. What is the alternative for Ukraine? Without more military aid and ammunition, the alternative is currently very limited. European ammunition stockpiles are empty, the spring production plans have not yet materialised, and Washington is stockpiling for fear of China.

From here came quite a few mistakes.**  \n>  \n>\u201cThis is a flawed analysis from the outset and there is a lack of understanding of how the local market operates.

From here came quite a few mistakes.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis is a flawed analysis from the outset and there is a lack of understanding of how the local market operates. It is unfortunate that the researchers did not check with Israeli stock exchange members, they could have asked how these things work in the country.\u201d  </p>\n\n<p>Mitts told Reuters the report had been corrected but said the issue did not impact the \u201chighly unusual\u201d short trading activity on the ETF.  </p>\n\n<p>The research said it had identified similar patterns in trading in the BlackRock Israel ETF in April of his year when it was reported Hamas was planning to execute similar attacks in October.  </p>\n\n<p>\u201cOur findings suggest that traders informed about the coming attacks profited from these tragic events, and consistent with prior literature we show that trading of this kind occurs in gaps in US and international enforcement of legal prohibitions on informed trading,\u201d the authors wrote.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Making a super basic mistake inflating potential profits by 100x, lol.

        "body": "[**ICC prosecutor's cautious approach to Israel and Gaza under scrutiny**  *The October 7 attack by Hamas and the Israeli bombings in Gaza have led the International Criminal Court Prosecutor Karim Khan to give priority to the Israeli-Palestinian issue. This investigation is being closely monitored by states and NGOs.*](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2023/12/08/icc-prosecutor-s-cautious-approach-to-israel-and-gaza-under-scrutiny_6325238_4.html)   \n\n> A few hours after leaving Israel, Prosecutor Karim Khan joined the annual meeting of the 123 state parties to the International Criminal Court (ICC) at the United Nations headquarters in New York on Monday, December 4. The prosecutor has until December 14 to defend his budget on the three major cases that have come before him since he took office in June 2021: Ukraine, Darfur and Palestine.  \n> \n> The 2023 session of this assembly promises to be eventful. On November 17, South Africa, the Comoros, Djibouti, Bolivia and Bangladesh referred to the Court over the colonization of the Palestinian territories and the ongoing bombardments in Gaza. Their aim was to compel the prosecutor to take up the most sensitive case ever brought before the Court. \"If, in the future, it is considered that the prosecutor is hesitating, there could be a massive withdrawal\" from the Court's treaty, said a diplomatic source. This threat has been made in the past, but would be more serious this time, \"especially as in 2023, the sense of allegiance [of several countries to the West] has clearly changed.\" Other non-member states also intend to exert influence. In November, the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation announced that they would appoint a team to monitor the progress of the investigation.  \n> \n> All these initiatives hold a mirror up to the West. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, more than 40 states overwhelmingly supported the prosecutor. In contrast, Western support for the investigation into the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been more hesitant. At the opening of the Assembly on December 4, Human Rights Watch deplored political positions that feed \"perceptions of double standards in government support for international justice, putting the ICC\u2019s legitimacy at risk.\" In this particular case, the lack of support has long been coupled with direct opposition to the investigation.      \n> \n> From the opening chapter, with the symbolic filing of a complaint against Israel in 2009, Israel, which is not a member of the ICC, has tried to prevent any examination by the Court of the conflict that has pitted it against the Palestinians since 1948. The Palestinian Authority went through years of proceedings before obtaining a case number: ICC-01/18. Former prosecutor Fatou Bensouda opened an investigation in March 2021, three months before handing over to Khan. But for nearly three years, the case of crimes committed since June 2014 in the occupied Palestinian territories has been at a standstill. Palestine has been a member of the Court since 2015 and, as such, the prosecutor also has jurisdiction over crimes committed on Israeli territory by any Palestinian national. A complaint to this effect has been lodged by the Israeli families of victims of the October 7 attacks launched by Hamas in southern Israel.  \n> \n> **Risk of hindrance**  \n> \n> Over the past decade, Israel has fought the ICC on all fronts: legal, diplomatic, etc. Palestinian human rights NGOs such as Al Haq and Al Mezan, which cooperate with the ICC, have been labeled \"terrorist\" organizations by Israel since 2022. They have even been subjected to \"threats, acts of intimidation and interference,\" including in the Netherlands, as reported by the Court in 2016, but no prosecutions for obstruction of justice have been brought. \"We are paying a heavy price for our cooperation,\" Al Haq's lawyer Ahmed Abofoul recently told Le Monde.  \n> \n> Germany, Hungary, Australia, Canada, Uganda, the Czech Republic and Brazil had openly opposed the opening of the enquiry in 2021, following visits by Israeli President Isaac Herzog, who lobbied from capital to capital. The United Kingdom, Canada, the Netherlands and Germany have always refused to recognize the \"State of Palestine\" within the ICC. As for the United States, which is not a member of the Court, it prohibits the ICC from prosecuting its nationals or those of its allies. In 2020, it even imposed sanctions on the former prosecutor for a few months. In addition, Washington makes its aid to the Palestinian Authority conditional, prohibiting Ramallah from cooperating with the ICC's investigation and the proceedings before the International Court of Justice, the UN's highest court, which is soon to issue a legal opinion on the legality of the Israeli occupation.  \n>   \n> \n> Aware of the risks of obstruction to the investigations, NGOs such as Amnesty International, professors and lawyers have called for support for the prosecutor, even if his actions and speeches leave some ambiguity as to his intentions. On November 30, Khan featured prominently in a photo posted on X by the ICC, indicating that he was \"visiting #Israel.\" The message stated, however, that the trip was \"at the request and invitation of survivors & the families of victims of the 7 October attacks.\" It also announced that Khan would also be visiting Ramallah.  \n> \n> **More comments than decisions**  \n> \n> For years, Palestinian human rights organizations have been inviting ICC investigators to visit the occupied territories but to no avail. This trip therefore came as a surprise, as did the stated reason for the visit. The prosecutor did not go there to investigate but to express his sympathy for the Palestinians, as the Court explained. In 2016, teams from the former prosecutor, Bensouda, had visited the area for \"social and educational activities,\" a terminology adopted under pressure from Israel. Yael Vias Gvirsman, a lawyer representing relatives of Hamas victims, considered Khan's visit to be a step forward: \"The Israeli government could have raised a problem, but it did not. This is already a first step.\" \n> \n> On his return from the kibbutzim of Beeri, Kfar Aza, and the site of the Nova festival in Re'im on December 1, where Hamas attacks killed more than 1,200 people, Khan spoke of \"innocent Israeli civilians\" and mentioned Hamas and \"other terrorist groups.\" Since October 7, diplomats and UN officials have been waiting for precise words to describe the Hamas attacks and bombings in Gaza: war crimes, collateral damage, genocide? But Khan comments more than he decides. The British prosecutor focuses on urgent matters, in line with Western priorities: the release of hostages held by Hamas, the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza, the fight against settler violence in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.  \n> \n> Israel's policy of colonizing the occupied territories remains the most sensitive aspect of these investigations. It is on this essential and well-documented part of the conflict that certain states, such as South Africa, intend to exercise control.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2023/12/08/icc-prosecutor-s-cautious-approach-to-israel-and-gaza-under-scrutiny_6325238_4.html\"><strong>ICC prosecutor&#39;s cautious approach to Israel and Gaza under scrutiny</strong>  <em>The October 7 attack by Hamas and the Israeli bombings in Gaza have led the International Criminal Court Prosecutor Karim Khan to give priority to the Israeli-Palestinian issue. This investigation is being closely monitored by states and NGOs.</em></a>   </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>A few hours after leaving Israel, Prosecutor Karim Khan joined the annual meeting of the 123 state parties to the International Criminal Court (ICC) at the United Nations headquarters in New York on Monday, December 4. The prosecutor has until December 14 to defend his budget on the three major cases that have come before him since he took office in June 2021: Ukraine, Darfur and Palestine.  </p>\n\n<p>The 2023 session of this assembly promises to be eventful. On November 17, South Africa, the Comoros, Djibouti, Bolivia and Bangladesh referred to the Court over the colonization of the Palestinian territories and the ongoing bombardments in Gaza. Their aim was to compel the prosecutor to take up the most sensitive case ever brought before the Court. &quot;If, in the future, it is considered that the prosecutor is hesitating, there could be a massive withdrawal&quot; from the Court&#39;s treaty, said a diplomatic source. This threat has been made in the past, but would be more serious this time, &quot;especially as in 2023, the sense of allegiance [of several countries to the West] has clearly changed.&quot; Other non-member states also intend to exert influence. In November, the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation announced that they would appoint a team to monitor the progress of the investigation.  </p>\n\n<p>All these initiatives hold a mirror up to the West. Following Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, more than 40 states overwhelmingly supported the prosecutor. In contrast, Western support for the investigation into the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been more hesitant. At the opening of the Assembly on December 4, Human Rights Watch deplored political positions that feed &quot;perceptions of double standards in government support for international justice, putting the ICC\u2019s legitimacy at risk.&quot; In this particular case, the lack of support has long been coupled with direct opposition to the investigation.      </p>\n\n<p>From the opening chapter, with the symbolic filing of a complaint against Israel in 2009, Israel, which is not a member of the ICC, has tried to prevent any examination by the Court of the conflict that has pitted it against the Palestinians since 1948. The Palestinian Authority went through years of proceedings before obtaining a case number: ICC-01/18. Former prosecutor Fatou Bensouda opened an investigation in March 2021, three months before handing over to Khan. But for nearly three years, the case of crimes committed since June 2014 in the occupied Palestinian territories has been at a standstill. Palestine has been a member of the Court since 2015 and, as such, the prosecutor also has jurisdiction over crimes committed on Israeli territory by any Palestinian national. A complaint to this effect has been lodged by the Israeli families of victims of the October 7 attacks launched by Hamas in southern Israel.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Risk of hindrance</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>Over the past decade, Israel has fought the ICC on all fronts: legal, diplomatic, etc. Palestinian human rights NGOs such as Al Haq and Al Mezan, which cooperate with the ICC, have been labeled &quot;terrorist&quot; organizations by Israel since 2022. They have even been subjected to &quot;threats, acts of intimidation and interference,&quot; including in the Netherlands, as reported by the Court in 2016, but no prosecutions for obstruction of justice have been brought. &quot;We are paying a heavy price for our cooperation,&quot; Al Haq&#39;s lawyer Ahmed Abofoul recently told Le Monde.  </p>\n\n<p>Germany, Hungary, Australia, Canada, Uganda, the Czech Republic and Brazil had openly opposed the opening of the enquiry in 2021, following visits by Israeli President Isaac Herzog, who lobbied from capital to capital. The United Kingdom, Canada, the Netherlands and Germany have always refused to recognize the &quot;State of Palestine&quot; within the ICC. As for the United States, which is not a member of the Court, it prohibits the ICC from prosecuting its nationals or those of its allies. In 2020, it even imposed sanctions on the former prosecutor for a few months. In addition, Washington makes its aid to the Palestinian Authority conditional, prohibiting Ramallah from cooperating with the ICC&#39;s investigation and the proceedings before the International Court of Justice, the UN&#39;s highest court, which is soon to issue a legal opinion on the legality of the Israeli occupation.  </p>\n\n<p>Aware of the risks of obstruction to the investigations, NGOs such as Amnesty International, professors and lawyers have called for support for the prosecutor, even if his actions and speeches leave some ambiguity as to his intentions. On November 30, Khan featured prominently in a photo posted on X by the ICC, indicating that he was &quot;visiting #Israel.&quot; The message stated, however, that the trip was &quot;at the request and invitation of survivors &amp; the families of victims of the 7 October attacks.&quot; It also announced that Khan would also be visiting Ramallah.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>More comments than decisions</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>For years, Palestinian human rights organizations have been inviting ICC investigators to visit the occupied territories but to no avail. This trip therefore came as a surprise, as did the stated reason for the visit. The prosecutor did not go there to investigate but to express his sympathy for the Palestinians, as the Court explained. In 2016, teams from the former prosecutor, Bensouda, had visited the area for &quot;social and educational activities,&quot; a terminology adopted under pressure from Israel. Yael Vias Gvirsman, a lawyer representing relatives of Hamas victims, considered Khan&#39;s visit to be a step forward: &quot;The Israeli government could have raised a problem, but it did not. This is already a first step.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>On his return from the kibbutzim of Beeri, Kfar Aza, and the site of the Nova festival in Re&#39;im on December 1, where Hamas attacks killed more than 1,200 people, Khan spoke of &quot;innocent Israeli civilians&quot; and mentioned Hamas and &quot;other terrorist groups.&quot; Since October 7, diplomats and UN officials have been waiting for precise words to describe the Hamas attacks and bombings in Gaza: war crimes, collateral damage, genocide? But Khan comments more than he decides. The British prosecutor focuses on urgent matters, in line with Western priorities: the release of hostages held by Hamas, the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza, the fight against settler violence in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.  </p>\n\n<p>Israel&#39;s policy of colonizing the occupied territories remains the most sensitive aspect of these investigations. It is on this essential and well-documented part of the conflict that certain states, such as South Africa, intend to exercise control. Observers noted that it only took one decree for the prosecutor to issue an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin. On the Israeli-Palestinian issue, Khan has already suggested that, in the absence of clear political support, this will take time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Gaza City, which has been largely flattened, had a population of 600k.</p></li>\n<li><p>Ukrainian towns were nearly empty of civilians when the fighting arrived. People in Gaza are penned in, with nowhere to go. As a result, there is a huge civilian population in Gaza under intense bombardment, with no way to flee.</p></li>\n</ol>\n</div>",
