      "selftext": "The r/CredibleDefense daily megathread is for asking questions and posting submissions that would not fit the criteria of our post submissions. As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster. Don't abuse it though! If something is not obviously against the rules but you still feel that it should be reviewed, leave a short but descriptive comment while filing the report.",

Same for a propeller, even a slightly damaged one can cause significant vibrations that may damage the engine and if that suffers serious damage, the ship is as good as gone.</p>\n\n<p>That being said, from the last video, the explosives seems to be quite high in the craft and that will limit the damage suffered by the hull or machinery as surface level explosions are nowhere near as damaging as one below the surface, assuming no direct contact with the hull (even 1m depth will make a huge difference).</p>\n</div>",

The bomblets are an issue for the post war clean up, but ultimately it is on Ukrainian territory and they should have the right to use these weapons in self defense.\n\nEvery cluster munitions used complicates that postwar cleanup more.  Some will not be cleaned up, and the more of them that are used, the higher that number will be.

Most of what is \"left wing\" of RoK came of age so to speak as the main resistance against then right wing dictators in 1960's to 1980's.  Either straight up political opposition, labor movements or maybe human rights activists etc.  Since the right wing dictators were so draconian, they had to be against whatever dictators were for and favored whatever dictators were against.  At least that's the overarching narrative that covers.\n\nAs for individual issue/country,  Pro-NK part is not that majority left in RoK want to live under Kim Jung-Un's rule - though I'm sure you can find real dyed in the wool \"communists\" who want DPRK to absorb RoK - but they think North Koreans are the poor cousins that need help not more sanctions.

As it is, PRC is integral to propping up the DPRK regime and if they want to rein in DPRK's nuclear program - I'm talking about the freeze b/c they will never agree to \"denuclearization\" under current geopolitical conditions - RoK is going to need China.

In that, most Koreans are anti-Japan, just in different spectrum.  Park Chung-Hee being an imperial Japanese lieutenant in 1940's surely didn't help.

        "body": "[Interesting satellite data by time](https://archive.ph/WmDpa).\n\n(follow the link to see the charts, link to un-paywalled version)\n\n> Ukraine\u2019s armed forces are turning up the heat. In the past two weeks our analysis of satellite data has detected 907 fires likely to be war-related in Russian-held territory in Ukraine. That\u2019s more than four times as many as in the two weeks before (see chart). From Kharkiv to Kherson activity along the frontline, and apparent strikes on the Russian rear, are picking up. The last time something like this happened, last autumn, it preceded Ukraine\u2019s impressive gains in the south.\n\n> Our system relies on satellites that circle over Ukraine twice a day and uses thermal imaging to detect high-temperature events in places not obscured by clouds. We use a machine-learning system to estimate whether these events are related to the war, by comparing patterns with what was observed before Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in 2022. It is far from perfect, but it offers a consistent and neutral guide to probable military activity in the country.\n\n> The latest reading, on May 25th, shows a spike in high-temperature events in Russian-held areas (we use maps produced by the Institute for the Study of War, a think-tank, to assess areas of control). Whether this really is the beginning of the much-touted counter-offensive is not easy to say. Such an operation is only readily observed if it succeeds, or fails spectacularly. Our data do not yet suggest a large Ukrainian advance, or gains of territory. Rather, they are consistent with a force laying the groundwork for that to happen. Ukraine appears to be probing defences for weaknesses, and, by striking command posts and logistics far behind the front line, reducing the ability of Russia\u2019s forces to plug gaps.\n\n> The uptick in the number of fires began on May 11th. There is reason to believe that on the same day Ukraine began using Storm Shadow missiles, long-range weapons capable of striking fortified positions, which were sent by Britain. The average number of fires marked as war-related in Russian-held areas is currently at the highest since August 2nd 2022\u2014more than 100 per day. (These totals are only a guide to activity: the satellites cannot register all fires and larger ones may sometimes be recorded as multiple smaller ones.)\n\n> If and where Ukrainian forces will advance will depend in part on what these stage-setting operations reveal about Russian defences. A strike in the south, perhaps over the Dnipro river near Kherson, is one option, as it would endanger Russia\u2019s control of Crimea. Another is a renewed push in the north, following up on past advances eastward from Kharkiv. And, between the two, Ukrainian forces are still fighting, and making limited advances, around Bakhmut (despite claims that the city has fallen to Russia). We have detected activity in all three areas in the past week. A successful strike south-east from Zaporizhia would be appealing, too. It would cut off the land bridge to Crimea and Russian forces west of Melitopol.\n\n> For a decisive breakthrough, surprise will be key.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://archive.ph/WmDpa\">Interesting satellite data by time</a>.</p>\n\n<p>(follow the link to see the charts, link to un-paywalled version)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ukraine\u2019s armed forces are turning up the heat. In the past two weeks our analysis of satellite data has detected 907 fires likely to be war-related in Russian-held territory in Ukraine. That\u2019s more than four times as many as in the two weeks before (see chart). From Kharkiv to Kherson activity along the frontline, and apparent strikes on the Russian rear, are picking up. The last time something like this happened, last autumn, it preceded Ukraine\u2019s impressive gains in the south.</p>\n\n<p>Our system relies on satellites that circle over Ukraine twice a day and uses thermal imaging to detect high-temperature events in places not obscured by clouds. We use a machine-learning system to estimate whether these events are related to the war, by comparing patterns with what was observed before Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in 2022. It is far from perfect, but it offers a consistent and neutral guide to probable military activity in the country.</p>\n\n<p>The latest reading, on May 25th, shows a spike in high-temperature events in Russian-held areas (we use maps produced by the Institute for the Study of War, a think-tank, to assess areas of control). Whether this really is the beginning of the much-touted counter-offensive is not easy to say. Such an operation is only readily observed if it succeeds, or fails spectacularly. Our data do not yet suggest a large Ukrainian advance, or gains of territory. Rather, they are consistent with a force laying the groundwork for that to happen. Ukraine appears to be probing defences for weaknesses, and, by striking command posts and logistics far behind the front line, reducing the ability of Russia\u2019s forces to plug gaps.</p>\n\n<p>The uptick in the number of fires began on May 11th. There is reason to believe that on the same day Ukraine began using Storm Shadow missiles, long-range weapons capable of striking fortified positions, which were sent by Britain. The average number of fires marked as war-related in Russian-held areas is currently at the highest since August 2nd 2022\u2014more than 100 per day. (These totals are only a guide to activity: the satellites cannot register all fires and larger ones may sometimes be recorded as multiple smaller ones.)</p>\n\n<p>If and where Ukrainian forces will advance will depend in part on what these stage-setting operations reveal about Russian defences. A strike in the south, perhaps over the Dnipro river near Kherson, is one option, as it would endanger Russia\u2019s control of Crimea. Another is a renewed push in the north, following up on past advances eastward from Kharkiv. And, between the two, Ukrainian forces are still fighting, and making limited advances, around Bakhmut (despite claims that the city has fallen to Russia). We have detected activity in all three areas in the past week. A successful strike south-east from Zaporizhia would be appealing, too. It would cut off the land bridge to Crimea and Russian forces west of Melitopol.</p>\n\n<p>For a decisive breakthrough, surprise will be key. That might mean feints in one location, to draw or pin down Russian forces, before major strikes elsewhere. Wherever the thrust of the attack might be, Ukrainian commanders will try to keep their Russian counterparts, and the rest of us, guessing what they might do next.\u25a07</p>\n\n<p>Inspect all our code, data, and models <a href=\"https://github.com/TheEconomist/the-economist-war-fire-model\">on GitHub</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

As for gaining market share post-Russia, we\u2019re a few years out from being able to call the winners. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Buying the F-35 is great, but really sucks if you give up on domestic fighter production abilities, and become entirely dependent on the US for one of your most critical weapon systems. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes, but the viability of that domestic fighter is reliant on export customers not nearly so invested in the continuation of your arms industry. It\u2019s very likely that to succeed, France will have to keep their partnerships to develop FCAS going for well over a decade after the US has unveiled, and likely began to export NGAD. If a few of those countries ditch the program when they run into difficulty, or just think NGAD is better value for money, FCAS may fall through. Forcing France to either foot the bill on their own, which they almost certainly can\u2019t, rely on Rafales forever, or give up on domestic fighter production.</p>\n</div>",

Discussions run hot if its faked or not, like always with videos where ukraine takes casualties. I dont wanna debate wether its fake or not, because i dont know enough to really say if it is. (although i dont see anything obviously fake) \n\nThere also was discussions in this sub recently, about if the destroyed Humvees at the Border Check Point in Belgogrod where placed by russian forces to propagate a win. \n\nThese two described situations lead to my question: How much value do little fake videos like these have in the bigger propaganda picture? I imagine there has to be a lot of effort put in making these videos or pics to even produce something that looks legit. For example planning the gunfight in the staircase, staging the fight, making it look realistic or in the belgogrod case, transporting the beat up humvees and placing them in extra made ditches. \n\nAlso i remember a video of russia wich was confirmed fake a few months ago where there was an allegedly ukrainian soldier shooting at russia phonic citizens, which turned out to be filmed in a russian occupied location. \n\nAre these little videos really that good in shaping a narrative that it would make sense to put so much effort into making them?",

Discussions run hot if its faked or not, like always with videos where ukraine takes casualties. I dont wanna debate wether its fake or not, because i dont know enough to really say if it is. (although i dont see anything obviously fake) </p>\n\n<p>There also was discussions in this sub recently, about if the destroyed Humvees at the Border Check Point in Belgogrod where placed by russian forces to propagate a win. </p>\n\n<p>These two described situations lead to my question: How much value do little fake videos like these have in the bigger propaganda picture?
