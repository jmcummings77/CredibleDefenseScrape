High ranking officers are accused of predatory behaviour towards their subordinates, including but not limited to sexual, verbal, and physical abuse. \n\nIt describes the army as \"barely tolerating\" women, with 88% of women and 17% of men report having experienced some form of sexual harassment, while 46% of women reported experiencing some form of unwanted physical contact/sexual assualt, and the existance of a \"discernable pattern of rape\". Multiple incidents were reported of drink spiking, voyeuristic photography while in the shower or drunk, and of the need to put extra locks or a barricade up on bedroom doors. \n\nCadets reported multiple incidents of being kicked (including in the groin) and punched in the stomach by seniors while training, with several officers accused of singling out individuals for \"sadistic violence\". If a senior officer was removed for physical assault (which had sometimes ended in broken bones) then another person of senior rank would sometimes deal out further \"punishment\". These reprisal campaigns have been reported as being sustained for decades, and extend to forced psych evaluations, spurious court martials and Garda (police) callouts, and harassment of spouses. Not unsurprisingly, the suicide rate is described as being a cause for concern, making up 63 of the 732 deaths of defence force members. Multiple complaints have also been made about a negligent attitude to safety, particular in the air force where it is alleged that accidents and near-misses are covered up. \n\nMeanwhile, the retention crisis in the navy hit a new low [with a report which stated](https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-41109211.html) that not one of the current four vessels could go out on patrol if a single seamen were to report in sick. The current staffing level is somewhere between 700 and 750, compared to the minimum requirement of 1094. The article also highlights that just over 200 of those individuals will qualify for pensions at the end of the year with many expected to quit.\n\nFinally, on a less tragic note, [a nationwide consultancy program](https://www.thejournal.ie/national-forum-irelands-neutrality-6036486-Apr2023/) will be launched in June with the remit of re-examining our current defence status. Submissions will be taken from both European experts and the general public. It's worth mentioning if this seems weird that for the last decade or so, referenda on controversial subjects have been preceded by these public consultation sessions (usually called citizen's assemblies) which essentially have the purpose of creating the space in which more level headed arguements can be made. \n\nThat article also mentions the the government may be moving towards the removal of the triple-lock, essentially a self-imposed restriction where we must get UN approval for foreign troop deployments.",

By the end of the year, that number could be closer to 2,500. However, that\u2019s a bit deceptive as Ukraine tends to get this ammo in tranches from allies, not a monthly delivery.\n\n>Then there\u2019s this story from Euromaidan Press on Ukraine\u2019s domestic efforts to supply it\u2019s 152 mm Soviet-designed artillery, an effort that is netting about 1,000-2,000 shells a month. Fortunately, additional shells are coming in from Poland, Latvia, and other allies in Europe. Right now, total European production of 152 mm shells is estimated at about 50,000 a month, or about 1,700 a day.\n\n>These numbers\u2014around 3,000 rounds a day\u2014represent the current sustainable rate of fire for Ukraine. Expect it to be around 5,000 in the next few months. This can be supplemented by tapping into the stockpiles of shells that were available before the invasion began, not just in Ukraine, but the U.S. and all the European allies.

And that was before any effects that sanctions may have had on these factories\u2019 maintenance. That means at best, Russia can build, in a month, what it was firing in less than four days. Even if Russia has managed to double their pre-war capacity, they are still seriously hurting for ammo.\n\nA pretty good look at the ammo production.

Europe production I think was base 250k, looking like will triple by the end of the year. For 63k a month. \n\nSo just some paper napkin math.

        "body": ">[US-Japan Alliance to Do \u2018Great Harm\u2019 to China\u2019s Chip Ambitions](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-04/us-gets-new-levers-from-japan-to-curb-china-s-chip-ambitions)\n\n>* New export curbs make relying on Japan riskier for China\n>* Japan is home to numerous key linchpins in chip supply chain\n\n>Japan\u2019s decision to join the US and Netherlands in restricting exports of chipmaking gear to China is giving the allies powerful new weapons to deploy in the escalating technology war.\n\n>Japan\u2019s trade ministry said last week that suppliers of 23 types of chip technology will need government approval to export to countries including China as early as July. That affects a broad range of companies that have been central to China\u2019s efforts to build a domestic chip industry, including Tokyo Electron Ltd., Nikon Corp. and Screen Holdings Co.\n\n>While not as high-profile as their counterparts in the US or Netherlands, Japanese companies control key steps in the semiconductor supply chain, which could be used as potential chokepoints against China. Screen, for instance, is the leading producer of wafer cleaning equipment. Lasertec Corp. is the sole supplier of machines needed to inspect designs for the world\u2019s most advanced chips, using extreme ultraviolet lithography chipmaking.\n\n>\u201cThe goal of these new controls is to cut off Chinese firms from a broad array of advanced chipmaking tools with the aim of making it more difficult for Chinese firms to manufacture advanced chips for artificial-intelligence purposes,\u201d said Chris Miller, an economic historian and author of Chip War: the Fight for the World\u2019s Most Critical Technology. The idea is to slow down China\u2019s tech development to help widen the gap between China\u2019s military capabilities and that of the US and its allies, he said. \n\n>When the Biden administration unveiled its sweeping restrictions on chip-related exports to China in October, American companies such as Applied Materials Inc. were directly affected by the rules. With the addition of the Netherlands and now Japan, all the major countries that produce chipmaking equipment are participating in the China blockade. The restrictions cover the most advanced machines, including those that make logic chips at 16 nanometers or more advanced geometries.  \n\n>\u201cJapan joining the export curbs will do great harm to China\u2019s ability to make and develop chips smaller than 16 nanometers,\u201d said Akira Minamikawa, analyst at research company Omdia.\n\n>The three-country alliance will certainly compel Beijing to step up efforts to develop Chinese supplies of chipmaking equipment and materials, so it\u2019s no longer reliant on foreign suppliers. But that will take years and increase the cost of producing semiconductors for the Chinese market. \n\n>\u201cEven if China develops its own chip technology, the standards will be completely different from those of the rest of the world,\u201d said Toyo Securities analyst Hideki Yasuda. \u201cThat\u2019s going to mean more costly chips that lower its tech competitiveness.\u201d \n\n>Over the weekend, China\u2019s Foreign Minister Qin Gang urged his Japanese counterpart to refrain from supporting US efforts to suppress the Chinese semiconductor industry. Qin said a chip blockade will only strengthen Beijing\u2019s resolve to achieve self-reliance. On Tuesday evening, China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce issued a statement saying the country had \u201cgrave concern\u201d over Japan\u2019s plans. \n\n>Chinese chip-related stocks surged amid optimism that they will benefit from Beijing\u2019s semiconductor efforts. Ingenic Semiconductor Co. jumped 13% on Monday and another 10% on Tuesday.\n\n>Yoshimasa Hayashi, Japan\u2019s minister of foreign affairs, declined to make any such commitments during his trip to Beijing, instead pressing Qin for the swift return of a Japanese citizen detained by Beijing. \n\n>The country\u2019s stance will likely cost Japanese companies in lost sales. Nikon, for example, gets about 28% of its revenue from China and it has been banking on strong demand for its immersion lithography machines in China to help finance its next technological bet, aimed at closing the gap with Dutch rival ASML Holding NV.\n\n>\u201cThis forces Nikon to go back to the drawing board on its China strategy for immersion lithography machines,\u201d said Kazuyoshi Saito, senior analyst at Iwai Cosmo Securities.\n\n>Nikon is now evaluating the impact of Japan\u2019s chip curbs on its earnings, a spokesperson said. \u201cWe will follow all regulations and work to maximize our performance within any given framework.\u201d\n\n>Japan is home to dominant makers of photoresist coaters and developers and mask inspection equipment needed to make the most advanced chips, as well as the single biggest source of silicon wafers and many of the fine chemicals necessary.\n\n>Many have grown with the Chinese economy, helping to fuel their customers\u2019 technological ascent. Some even benefited from the geopolitical rivalry between Washington and Beijing, as that spurred more Chinese customers to pay a premium for Japanese equipment, bolstering Japan chip gear exports to its biggest trading partner last year, despite a slowdown in the overall semiconductor market.\n\n>Screen gets about a quarter of its revenue from China now, helped by a surge in demand from chipmakers such as Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. But if Chinese customers can no longer buy its gear they will have to turn to less proven alternatives. \n\n>Prior to Japan\u2019s announcement, it had said it expected that proportion to fall to around 20% for 2023. The company said it would follow the Trade Ministry instructions.\n\n>Yokohama-based Lasertec holds a unique place in the semiconductor supply chain.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-04/us-gets-new-levers-from-japan-to-curb-china-s-chip-ambitions\">US-Japan Alliance to Do \u2018Great Harm\u2019 to China\u2019s Chip Ambitions</a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>New export curbs make relying on Japan riskier for China</li>\n<li>Japan is home to numerous key linchpins in chip supply chain</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Japan\u2019s decision to join the US and Netherlands in restricting exports of chipmaking gear to China is giving the allies powerful new weapons to deploy in the escalating technology war.</p>\n\n<p>Japan\u2019s trade ministry said last week that suppliers of 23 types of chip technology will need government approval to export to countries including China as early as July. That affects a broad range of companies that have been central to China\u2019s efforts to build a domestic chip industry, including Tokyo Electron Ltd., Nikon Corp. and Screen Holdings Co.</p>\n\n<p>While not as high-profile as their counterparts in the US or Netherlands, Japanese companies control key steps in the semiconductor supply chain, which could be used as potential chokepoints against China. Screen, for instance, is the leading producer of wafer cleaning equipment. Lasertec Corp. is the sole supplier of machines needed to inspect designs for the world\u2019s most advanced chips, using extreme ultraviolet lithography chipmaking.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe goal of these new controls is to cut off Chinese firms from a broad array of advanced chipmaking tools with the aim of making it more difficult for Chinese firms to manufacture advanced chips for artificial-intelligence purposes,\u201d said Chris Miller, an economic historian and author of Chip War: the Fight for the World\u2019s Most Critical Technology. The idea is to slow down China\u2019s tech development to help widen the gap between China\u2019s military capabilities and that of the US and its allies, he said. </p>\n\n<p>When the Biden administration unveiled its sweeping restrictions on chip-related exports to China in October, American companies such as Applied Materials Inc. were directly affected by the rules. With the addition of the Netherlands and now Japan, all the major countries that produce chipmaking equipment are participating in the China blockade. The restrictions cover the most advanced machines, including those that make logic chips at 16 nanometers or more advanced geometries.  </p>\n\n<p>\u201cJapan joining the export curbs will do great harm to China\u2019s ability to make and develop chips smaller than 16 nanometers,\u201d said Akira Minamikawa, analyst at research company Omdia.</p>\n\n<p>The three-country alliance will certainly compel Beijing to step up efforts to develop Chinese supplies of chipmaking equipment and materials, so it\u2019s no longer reliant on foreign suppliers. But that will take years and increase the cost of producing semiconductors for the Chinese market. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cEven if China develops its own chip technology, the standards will be completely different from those of the rest of the world,\u201d said Toyo Securities analyst Hideki Yasuda. \u201cThat\u2019s going to mean more costly chips that lower its tech competitiveness.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>Over the weekend, China\u2019s Foreign Minister Qin Gang urged his Japanese counterpart to refrain from supporting US efforts to suppress the Chinese semiconductor industry. Qin said a chip blockade will only strengthen Beijing\u2019s resolve to achieve self-reliance. On Tuesday evening, China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce issued a statement saying the country had \u201cgrave concern\u201d over Japan\u2019s plans. </p>\n\n<p>Chinese chip-related stocks surged amid optimism that they will benefit from Beijing\u2019s semiconductor efforts. Ingenic Semiconductor Co. jumped 13% on Monday and another 10% on Tuesday.</p>\n\n<p>Yoshimasa Hayashi, Japan\u2019s minister of foreign affairs, declined to make any such commitments during his trip to Beijing, instead pressing Qin for the swift return of a Japanese citizen detained by Beijing. </p>\n\n<p>The country\u2019s stance will likely cost Japanese companies in lost sales. Nikon, for example, gets about 28% of its revenue from China and it has been banking on strong demand for its immersion lithography machines in China to help finance its next technological bet, aimed at closing the gap with Dutch rival ASML Holding NV.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis forces Nikon to go back to the drawing board on its China strategy for immersion lithography machines,\u201d said Kazuyoshi Saito, senior analyst at Iwai Cosmo Securities.</p>\n\n<p>Nikon is now evaluating the impact of Japan\u2019s chip curbs on its earnings, a spokesperson said. \u201cWe will follow all regulations and work to maximize our performance within any given framework.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Japan is home to dominant makers of photoresist coaters and developers and mask inspection equipment needed to make the most advanced chips, as well as the single biggest source of silicon wafers and many of the fine chemicals necessary.</p>\n\n<p>Many have grown with the Chinese economy, helping to fuel their customers\u2019 technological ascent. Some even benefited from the geopolitical rivalry between Washington and Beijing, as that spurred more Chinese customers to pay a premium for Japanese equipment, bolstering Japan chip gear exports to its biggest trading partner last year, despite a slowdown in the overall semiconductor market.</p>\n\n<p>Screen gets about a quarter of its revenue from China now, helped by a surge in demand from chipmakers such as Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. But if Chinese customers can no longer buy its gear they will have to turn to less proven alternatives. </p>\n\n<p>Prior to Japan\u2019s announcement, it had said it expected that proportion to fall to around 20% for 2023. The company said it would follow the Trade Ministry instructions.</p>\n\n<p>Yokohama-based Lasertec holds a unique place in the semiconductor supply chain. It\u2019s the only supplier of machines that do design inspections for extreme ultraviolet, or EUV, lithography chipmaking, the most advanced process for making chips. Its shipments to China were already constrained due to a ban on ASML\u2019s EUV lithography machine shipments.</p>\n\n<p>Japan\u2019s new restrictions \u2014 which don\u2019t affect exports bound for favored trading partners Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore \u2014 are an about-face that is resetting expectations throughout the country\u2019s $30 billion semiconductor equipment making industry. </p>\n\n<p>Tokyo Electron, which gets about 25% of its sales from mainland China, could see that drop by five to 10 percentage points, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Masahiro Wakasugi and Brian Moran. </p>\n\n<p>Tokyo Electron will act appropriately after assessing any new regulations, a spokesperson said.</p>\n\n<p>While China will try to develop its own technologies, historically it\u2019s been difficult to catch up in semiconductor technology due to the rapid improvement in processing power in rivals\u2019 integrated circuits, said Miller. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cJapan\u2019s new restrictions make it much harder for China,\u201d he said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Positions just a few kilometers to the west of the city are indisputably far more defensible, sitting on hills above the urban area at the bottom of the river valley, which in turn is downhill from the majority of the Russian positions to the east. So why not retreat if holding the city in such a poor tactical position is so costly? There's really only two possible theories: either the Ukrainian commanders or politicians are incompetent and stubbornly refuse to withdraw their troops for unspecified political intrigues or atavistic soviet habit, or holding the city is not (relatively speaking) as costly as it has been made out to be. My argument really comes down to the idea that such gross incompetence would be extremely out of character for Zelensky, Zaluzhny, and most of the other top civilian and military personnel involved in making the decision, in light of their consistently high performance as leaders over the last year. They're not always perfect, but they're far more than capable and practical enough to have withdrawn from Bakhmut if the losses there were anywhere even sort of close to compromising the spring offensive.\n\nAnd at the same time as they are not retreating from this maybe not so costly meat grinder of an urban battle, historically disciplined communicators in the Ukraine-friendly media or even Ukrainian government or military public relations officers have been letting slip news that seems pretty well crafted to play on Putin's prejudices to make Bakhmut seem like a more appealing target than it really is. By disciplined communicators, I mean professionals who have reasonably cozy official or unofficial relationships with western or Ukrainian government and military personnel. Think ex NATO staff officers, official spokespeople for the various UAF regional commands, front line officers interviewed by very friendly reporters like Hromadske's interviews, or even someone like Magyar who has built up an enormous independent social media following. These people get coaching on what to say, and seemingly always maintain opsec and stay on message, so definitely some friendly editing and approval for some of these interviews. \n\nI especially noticed when a bunch of these unofficial, semiofficial, and official spokespeople started independently using the exact same phrases in response to any reporters asking questions about casualties near Bakhmut or how hard the fighting is in Bakhmut. The phrase \"things are very hard\" came up over and over again, especially when a reported asked about specific casualty figures or equipment losses. As in they had been coached to use that exact phrase in response to that exact subject matter being brought up. It would be foolish not to start from the assumption that anyone serving in the Ukrainian military, especially in any kind of intel role, is an active participant in an effort to shape the information space. With hybrid warfare all the rage these days, the line between political propaganda and routine military deception activities is starting to blur even more.\n\nAnd yeah, the Ukrainians don't need a full on psyops campaign to tempt every single individual Russian in the Russian army into participating in futile human wave attacks. They just need to convince Vladimir Putin to order those Russian soldiers to participate in fruitless human wave attacks. That's a much lower bar, as I covered in detail that post.\n\nSo it's easy to see how a few well placed stories in the global foreign media could be crafted to push Putin in one direction or another, especially if you had a good sense of what he prefers to read and what tends to catch his attention. Which is why I am sure the Ukrainian intel agencies have entire departments devoted to scrutinizing Putin's every last tiny little activity for opportunities to get inside his decision loop and knock him off balance. Because if it worked, they'd get a lot of bang for their buck. It would be borderline criminally negligent if the Ukrainian security services weren't regularly engaged in precisely this sort of deception activity, even if I'm wrong about the particulars in this specific case. And well they should be, because they need every edge they can get. If not to guarantee victory, at least to guarantee a quicker end to the bloodshed.",

You are comparing apples and oranges a bit, but to the extent that you can compare the two categories of sources, I'd say you're better off with anonymous posters for the most part. The analysis depends in part on what kind of credibility you mean. The Russian general staff's credibility as a source for an objective statement of fact, their credibility in providing analysis of facts via explicit communication like written press statements, or their credibility in providing analysis of facts as evidenced by the actual on-the-ground military actions carried out pursuant to that analysis?\n\nAs a source of objective fact, the Russian MoD is worse than useless in most important cases. Not only because they lie about so many things as part of their propaganda efforts, but because they don't actually know the truth because their own subordinates lie to them. Vranyo and corruption are a bitch. As sources for objective facts, anonymous posters can be better if they include citations to evidence. But in that case they are not the source whose credibility needs to be evaluated, their cited sources are. So in a purely theoretically context, I'd call this one a tie, in that I would not trust an assertion of fact by either the Russian general staff or an anonymous poster unless that claim is backed either by citation or it matches my own independent information. However, in a much more practical sense, I would say anonymous posters here are far more likely to include citations to credible sources in their communications than the Russian general staff are. \n\nTheir credibility in terms of analysis is also pretty much negative, because any public statements by the Russian MoD are propaganda consisting of more fiction than fact. Their credibility as measured by the performance of the Russian military during this war is also about as low as I could imagine. We can't assess anonymous posters by that metric, but we can evaluate their reasoning and sources directly. And as sources of analysis, the anonymous posters here have at least been right some of the time. The Russian general staff have been quite consistently wrong, when evaluated by their battlefield performance. \n\nUltimately, while we need to read posts here critically and carefully, it is very possible to glean useful information and insight. Whereas I don't see much evidence-based reasoning or insights happening on the Russian general staff. There is at least the possibility the person posting here knows what they are talking about or is repeating analysis from someone who does. And you can check their sources and reasoning yourself.",

I wrote another [longish post back then](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/v4neox/ukraine_conflict_megathread_june_04_2022/ib6eynp/?context=10000) to push back against the doomposting then too, describing how the Ukrainians were conducting an apparently well-executed, flexible, mobile defense-in-depth, and were sacrificing relatively unimportant territory in exchange to buy time to mobilize and equip a larger army in the west. Which turned out to be a pretty reasonable assessment, but I sympathize with the doomposters in that Russia making progress at all is scary and generally not a good sign, so it's an understandable reaction for pro-Ukrainians to freak out a little when the tide turns against the UAF, even in a limited context. Just as it's understandable for pro-Russians to cling to any shred of evidence that gives them hope. So there are powerful emotional incentives for people on both sides of the conflict to exaggerate the significance of events adverse to Ukraine's interests as they unfold.\n\nWhich is why I don't think the narrative swing around Severodonetsk was a psyops campaign. I think it was a legitimate groundswell of anxiety throughout the pro-UAF community. Back then, the Ukrainians didn't even have HIMARS yet (or maybe they had just recently received the first systems but it was too soon for them to have made a measurable difference yet, I forget the exact order of events). They hadn't succeeded on the offensive at all, other than chasing the Russians out of places they withdrew from voluntarily (-ish) like Kyiv. It wasn't totally clear that they'd stopped the Russians in their tracks in the south between Kherson and Mykolaiv, so a push toward Odesa still seemed plausible, if increasingly unlikely. And the UAF hadn't managed to stabilize the lines in the JFO yet, so it still seemed possible that the victories around Kyiv and Sumy might have been flukes and the \"real\" Russian army would show up any day now to finish Ukraine off. So even to the extent things looked favorable for Ukraine, there were many open questions remaining about western support; the extent of Russian resolve, resources, and reserves; the ability of the Ukrainians to overcome their historical challenges with corruption and lingering Soviet institutional inertia; etc., the list goes on.\n\nNow a lot of those questions have been answered decisively in Ukraine's favor, and I think you can actually see more generally people across the information space seem to take a more moderate tone when it comes to UAF setbacks now, because the doomposters keep being proven wrong. When I started seeing that trend break down in regards to Bakhmut, I began to consider the possibility of some party intentionally trying to shift the information space for a specific purpose, which in turn led me down the road of that incredibly long post detailing how many pro-UAF elements seemed to be promoting the story of weakness in Bakhmut, more than even Russian-aligned media. Any which way you cut it, even if I'm wrong about all this, it sure looks suspicious.",

I\u2018m defending neither Schr\u00f6der nor Merkel here but your take is not very nuanced. \n\nGerman-Russian relations for a long time were dominated by a policy called \"Wandel durch Handel\", where it was hoped that Russia would democratize if the West engaged with them via trade (similar to how the US dealt with China). These ambitions got increasingly overshadowed as time went on by a distinct opportunism on the German side, who ignored the failure of this approach way past due because the industry profited immensely from cheap Russian resources. \n\nCombine this with the Social Democrats misinterpreting Willy Brandt\u2018s relaxation politics of the 1970s as a way of letting Russia do whatever they want and you got the recipe of how we ended up here.\n\nBtw, Schr\u00f6der didn\u2018t commit treason by any metric. The courts didn\u2018t even deem his behavior as worthy of expulsion from bis party.
