Actually, for a time something like it was expected to be included in the currently planned changes, the fact that it isn't speaks for itself: it's just not easy and something of a hot potato for a society, and its forces, without any experience in the way. The reality of the Bundeswehr having so little appreciation within the country clearly doesn't help either in the idea of producing \"full-fledged\" citizens, a concept much more involved and expectations very different compared to the US.\n\n>I\u2019d imagine that if the German Army would allow a quicker pathway to citizenship via military service like the US armed forces does, some able-bodied legal permanent residents would be interested.\n\nI'm not aware of well-founded estimations as for possible numbers, though speaking of \"some\" looks like a reasonable starting point. Not too many that is, and that's in return for a heap of complications. For one thing, within in the last couple of years the requirements for attaining German citizenship have already been lowered, there are also \"express\" routes now. For another, there is a rather large number of people with immigration backgrounds living in the country in second or even third generation, who still don't bother attaining citizenship. There is simply not a huge need or enticement to do so. And the notion of yet higher levels of immigration doesn't chime in well with the contemporary climate and a far right already on the rise.",

        "body": "All of this is somewhat common knowledge in the PLAwatching community, but Rick Joe has now summed up what people have been able to glean about the current state of the PLAAF and its near future projects into one source:\n\n[https://thediplomat.com/2024/06/chinas-6th-generation-and-upcoming-combat-aircraft-2024-update/](https://thediplomat.com/2024/06/chinas-6th-generation-and-upcoming-combat-aircraft-2024-update/)\n\nTo me, two things are notable\n\nFirst, more concrete talk about the H-20 program. It's been unusually open for PLA procurement, but given the lack of updates I just assumed they had run into roadblocks. Which they could have still; but Rick also says there's rumours that the entire project is either being scaled down or having its requirements changed. Which sort of makes sense, when I think about what China is lacking, a strategic stealth bomber is not very high up the list\n\nSecond, and this is more for Ukraine really; run rate of the J-20 is now enough to modernize 3 PLAAF brigades per year.

It's also possible J-20 production may fluctuate (including going down for a bit from the recent estimates) as they get the A variant into production simply due to time needed to adjust and convert the line.

What assistance they formaly asked from Russia and through CSTO channels they largely recieved according to Armenian coverage. And while Azerbaijan is no longer a member of the CSTO, it's important to note that Nagorno-Karabakh was formally Azeri territory, and that it was made possible by a previous ethnic cleansing as well. So Armenia didn't trigger the defense pact also because formally they stood more so as a sponsor of a local autonomous government.\n\nAnd the \u201cwar\u201d wasn\u2019t so much an open war, but intermittent skirmishes and ceasefires. Armenia. Azerbaijan, Russia and the West were all involved in the ongoing ceasefire talks and Russian peacekeepers were present, on the ground, in Armenia. The west was more so backing the Azeris in the negotiations and Russia Armenia.\n\nA political agreement and ceasefire was reached where some territory was surrendered to the Azeris. So I\u2019m unsure at exactly what they wanted Russia to have done and didnt do and at which point and based on what international or CSTO conventions? If its not a matter of military intervention and support and more of a matter of pressure put upon Azerbaijan then the whole deal tiggering a shift to the west is too sensical seeing that it was NATO-Western allies  that held by far the most leverage over Azerbaijan and didnt use it.\n\nIf anything my impression from Pashinyan's acts since then seem to veer between 'maybe we can flirt with the EU/NATO' and 'maybe we should just wash our hands of this cause, keep our friendship with Iran and become a transit corridor' to try and find the best geopolitical balancing act for them.

Needless to say that should be something the CSTO was designed to prevent, and Armenia did trigger to prevent it.\n\nBeyond that a major complaint is that Russia stopped selling weapons to Armenia (including a few outstanding contracts) after 2020 (so even before the Ukraine war).

The transactional nature of their relationship with local governments also means they have little investment in their ultimate fate.\n\nI disagree- conflicts in this region of Africa are way less resource intensive than in other areas of the globe due to a number of factors. I\u2019m drawing this mostly by what I\u2019ve observed of the situation in Sudan -particularly Darfur. The UAE was able to significantly bolster the RSF\u2019s combat potential with some very limited arms shipments (limited at least when compared to other conflict areas). Most of the areas that fell to the Caliphate fell because the local militaries are servely incompetent and corrupt. Now I\u2019d argue that the corruption will only increase under Russian influence, but competency is something that can be counted on- really Russia is actually rather successful in these types of endeavors (Chechnya, The Donbas, Syria, Libya, CAR, etc) because they understand the game and aren\u2019t hamstrung by the morals and ethics we observe in the west. Plus, it\u2019s not really the Russian government proper as it is Wagner\u2019s current incarnation as the Afrika Korps- meaning the Russian government will be more tolerant of losses in lives, equipment, and the obscene politics of the Sahel, etc- way more so than western countries would be.\n\nThe Russians have also been rather successful in stabilizing strongmen and the despotic regimes they helm- and have generally been long term committed to the countries they\u2019ve invested in- as long as the spice flows of course.\n\n>\u00a0Western involvement would come from their support for coastal West African or even North African countries as the caliphate seeks to expand into them. Perhaps we'd get away with recreating our intervention against the original IS caliphate but I worry that the problem would be too big for partner forces in the region to tackle, even with uncapped US supporting airpower necessitating greater ground force involvement.\n\nWe\u2019re already seeing this now- however the interest just isn\u2019t there right now for anything beyond a very small western commitment to the area. The west has been very reactionary when it comes to the issue of Jihadism- and there are a hundred other fires going on right now that are burning hotter and larger. Not saying it\u2019s not a problem, rather the west likes to wait for a problem to bite it in the ass in a big way before it does anything about it as of late. That\u2019s probably what it would require for increased commitment and attention.\n\n>\u00a0In the worst case we're looking at parts of Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Chad, Nigeria, Sudan, Cameroon, CAR, and Benin all unified into a nakedly aggressive conglomeration.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s already there- like in Afghanistan there is a \u201cShadow Caliphate\u201d that isn\u2019t even really in the shadows anymore. Most of the states you mention don\u2019t have positive control of large parts of -or even the majority of the land- in their countries. But then again, it doesn\u2019t really affect day to day life in the centers of power. One of the reasons all these Juntas came to power was because of the huge disconnect between the military fighting the conflict and whoever was in power. It\u2019s a vicious cycle too, because a coup will happen because the military knows the seat of power is corrupt and doesn\u2019t care about the Jihadish issue. Then the new junta becomes corrupt and stops caring, and the cycle repeats.\n\nRussia may be able to break this cycle because they will basically do the heavy lifting for whatever corrupt government is in power. And they\u2019ll actually intervene in coups or prevent coups, while western nations sat on the sidelines and watched as their partner forces continually couped themselves year after year to the detriment of overall stability.",

The UAE was able to significantly bolster the RSF\u2019s combat potential with some very limited arms shipments (limited at least when compared to other conflict areas). Most of the areas that fell to the Caliphate fell because the local militaries are servely incompetent and corrupt. Now I\u2019d argue that the corruption will only increase under Russian influence, but competency is something that can be counted on- really Russia is actually rather successful in these types of endeavors (Chechnya, The Donbas, Syria, Libya, CAR, etc) because they understand the game and aren\u2019t hamstrung by the morals and ethics we observe in the west. Plus, it\u2019s not really the Russian government proper as it is Wagner\u2019s current incarnation as the Afrika Korps- meaning the Russian government will be more tolerant of losses in lives, equipment, and the obscene politics of the Sahel, etc- way more so than western countries would be.</p>\n\n<p>The Russians have also been rather successful in stabilizing strongmen and the despotic regimes they helm- and have generally been long term committed to the countries they\u2019ve invested in- as long as the spice flows of course.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u00a0Western involvement would come from their support for coastal West African or even North African countries as the caliphate seeks to expand into them. Perhaps we&#39;d get away with recreating our intervention against the original IS caliphate but I worry that the problem would be too big for partner forces in the region to tackle, even with uncapped US supporting airpower necessitating greater ground force involvement.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We\u2019re already seeing this now- however the interest just isn\u2019t there right now for anything beyond a very small western commitment to the area. The west has been very reactionary when it comes to the issue of Jihadism- and there are a hundred other fires going on right now that are burning hotter and larger. Not saying it\u2019s not a problem, rather the west likes to wait for a problem to bite it in the ass in a big way before it does anything about it as of late. That\u2019s probably what it would require for increased commitment and attention.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u00a0In the worst case we&#39;re looking at parts of Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Chad, Nigeria, Sudan, Cameroon, CAR, and Benin all unified into a nakedly aggressive conglomeration.\u00a0</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It\u2019s already there- like in Afghanistan there is a \u201cShadow Caliphate\u201d that isn\u2019t even really in the shadows anymore. Most of the states you mention don\u2019t have positive control of large parts of -or even the majority of the land- in their countries. But then again, it doesn\u2019t really affect day to day life in the centers of power. One of the reasons all these Juntas came to power was because of the huge disconnect between the military fighting the conflict and whoever was in power. It\u2019s a vicious cycle too, because a coup will happen because the military knows the seat of power is corrupt and doesn\u2019t care about the Jihadish issue. Then the new junta becomes corrupt and stops caring, and the cycle repeats.</p>\n\n<p>Russia may be able to break this cycle because they will basically do the heavy lifting for whatever corrupt government is in power. And they\u2019ll actually intervene in coups or prevent coups, while western nations sat on the sidelines and watched as their partner forces continually couped themselves year after year to the detriment of overall stability.</p>\n</div>",

None of the things Russia has done until now have involved sending troops into territory that the U.S. is treaty-bound to protect with its full military might. \n\nConsider Putin's mindset in January 2022. He assumed he could push into Ukraine and behead its government while the U.S./NATO scrambled to decide just how much to get involved militarily. Even if he was prepared to sever economic ties with the west and face decades-long armed insurgencies in occupied Ukraine, he was still confident he could fly Russian flags over Kyiv and present them as a *fait accompli* to the West. He reasonably assumed the U.S. would *not* send Western troops into a former Soviet republic to fight their nuclear peer over a non-treaty ally.\n\nWas it foolish thinking? Yes, but he had distinct, non-zero paths to accomplish his goals without risking military annihilation.\n\nNow consider his mindset today. If he attacks NATO, there are only two foreseeable medium-term outcomes: (a) crisis does not escalate into a nuclear exchange or a world war, but it largely results in the destruction of Russian forces, (b) crisis escalates into a nuclear exchange or a world war.\n\nWhat other ends might he possibly aim for in attacking NATO? Does he think Western forces will not attack the invading Russians? Does he think the U.S. will be stretched too thin to pull off a forceful response? Or what does he think he'll get out of it, that's so valuable as to justify the severe degradation of his country's military in the event of a war with NATO?\n\nGenuine question, by the way; I don't claim to know what goes through his mind!\n\nNow, it is possible that a change in the current circumstances opens up one of those paths for Putin. Maybe domestic politics in the U.S. putrefy our government into paralysis. Maybe there *is* a huge crisis in the Middle East *and* the Taiwan strait at the same time, and the U.S. is actually overstretched.

        "body": "This is a rather silly and probably a non-credible question, but this is something that bugs me a lot. I was listening to some articles on Germany promising to increase their military spending, a phenomenon that is also real in other European countries and I can\u2019t avoid the same question: why?\n\nNATO first and main line of defense is their nuclear missiles. NATO can promptly wipe out of existence both Russia and China\u2019s governments if a hot war erupted. If we\u2019re talking about gearing up a conventional army to stop an eventual Russian incursion, again I keep thinking on the why because I cannot think of any way that a Russian incursion in Latvia, Finland, Poland or Romania would not inevitably escalate to a massive nuclear exchange sooner or late that would render conventional armies useless even after the fallout. Sure, there is Ukraine and the possibility of Moldova being attacked, but even if so, we go back to a direct clash leading to an inevitable nuclear exchange.\n\nI can think about power projection and humanitarian interventions authorized by the UN in non-nuclear conflicts, but in this case wouldn\u2019t a small and highly specialized and mechanized army with a strong and modern air force do the trick? We would be talking about a force ready to intervene in the Sahel, Middle East and Subsaharan Africa (Southeast Asia and the Caribbean wouldn\u2019t be in the zone of influence, I believe).

Things can absolutely spiral out of control, yes, but I would assume that, in a scenario like this, both sides would want to figure out a way out of it before a massive nuclear exchange.\n\nThere's a theory that while MAD decreases the chances of total war between nuclear states, it may actually increase the likelihood of stuff like proxy wars or even low-level direct engagements between said nuclear powers.

                "body": "Proxy wars are one thing. Direct conflicts are another. There have been only two direct conflicts between two nuclear powers. \n\n\nLet's first examine the Kargil War, one you mentioned. Pakistan invaded Indian controlled territory in Kashmir. The city of Kargil was about ~5 miles from the de facto border between Indian / Pakistani Kashmir.\n\nSo the entire war was strictly limited to an area about 5 miles long, high up in altitude. Neither side attacked each the other in de jure territory. Most of the fighting was done with small arms and if you take casualties from both side, counting dead and wounded, you have a figure of less than 5,000.\n\nWho won the conflict? The end result was a white peace and a return to status quo. Pakistan was the aggressor and therefore failed in their war goals, but India did not gain anything anything. India is the winner here. So Pakistan was a nuclear power who definitively lost a war, but did not lose any territory or had any real penalties placed against it.\n\n The second is the Sino-Soviet border conflict in 1969. Most of the fighting was limited to an island on the Ussuri river. There was some fighting near the Xinjiang border as well, but the fighting was like the Kargil war and limited to a very small area of land.

                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Proxy wars are one thing. Direct conflicts are another. There have been only two direct conflicts between two nuclear powers. </p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s first examine the Kargil War, one you mentioned. Pakistan invaded Indian controlled territory in Kashmir. The city of Kargil was about ~5 miles from the de facto border between Indian / Pakistani Kashmir.</p>\n\n<p>So the entire war was strictly limited to an area about 5 miles long, high up in altitude. Neither side attacked each the other in de jure territory. Most of the fighting was done with small arms and if you take casualties from both side, counting dead and wounded, you have a figure of less than 5,000.</p>\n\n<p>Who won the conflict? The end result was a white peace and a return to status quo. Pakistan was the aggressor and therefore failed in their war goals, but India did not gain anything anything. India is the winner here. So Pakistan was a nuclear power who definitively lost a war, but did not lose any territory or had any real penalties placed against it.</p>\n\n<p>The second is the Sino-Soviet border conflict in 1969. Most of the fighting was limited to an island on the Ussuri river. There was some fighting near the Xinjiang border as well, but the fighting was like the Kargil war and limited to a very small area of land. The figure for the dead + casualties for both sides combined fits under 3,000. </p>\n\n<p>The end result of this war was just like the first one, a return to status quo.
