                            "body": "IMHO this is a very oversimplified summary of that paper, oversimplified to the point where it's not very accurate or, rather, to the point where most of the conclusions drawn on this oversimplified explanation are likely to be false.\n\nWhile your second description does accurately represent the statistics, your first description (\"the US voter has a low to nonexistent influence on public policy\") is actually not what the paper says:\n\n> The central point that emerges from our research is that economic elites and organized groups representing business interests have substantial independent impacts on U.S. government policy, while mass-based interest groups and average citizens have little or no **independent** influence.\n\n(emphasis mine). The authors do no mean that mass-based interest groups and average citizens have *no influence* on policy outcomes, they mean that they do not have direct, immediate, quantifiable influence over the decision-making process every step of the way, which is what *independent* influence actually amounts to.\n\nThe authors also work with an understandably \"amortized\" definition of influence over policy. That is, they consider a policy-influencing outcome to be favourable if one of the parties eventually sways the legislative into passing policy that's favourable to them, independent of its content -- that is, independent on whether the policy being eventually passed is *exactly* what a group wanted, or is subject to amendments from the other groups. This allows them to do a quantitative study in the first place, but ignores the process of democratic compromise -- it doesn't diminish their findings in any way but it also doesn't paint a full picture of how influence is distributed.\n\nIgnoring these details in the paper's findings amounts to ignoring the very thing that made the paper possible in the first place -- i.e. recognizing that democracy and democratic processes exist on a spectrum. Equating these findings with a repressive or oligarchical state simply because *some* of these findings exist in all is about as correct as equating a large city's water infrastructure with a large river based on debit and the presence of alligators alone and then trying to use the sewers to ship things.\n\nFirst of all, the paper notes that, while the mechanisms of decision-making policy are generally based on significantly non-representative groups (see below), *they are not necessarily in conflict*:\n\n>  Before we proceed further, it is important to note that even if one of our predictor variables is found (when controlling for the others) to have no independent impact on policy at all, it does not follow that the actors whose preferences are reflected by that variable\u2014average citizens, economic elites, or organized interest groups of one sort or another\u2014always \u201close\u201d in policy decisions. Policy making is not necessarily a zero-sum game among these actors. When one set of actors wins, others may win as well, if their preferences are positively correlated with each other.\n\n> It turns out, in fact, that the preferences of average citizens are positively and fairly highly correlated, across issues, with the preferences of economic elites (refer to table 2). Rather often, average citizens and affluent citizens (our proxy for economic elites) want the same things from government.\n\nLike all papers that attempt to do a quantitative study, this one doesn't speculate on the mechanisms behind this phenomenon, nor on the reasons why it happens in the first place. However, the paper does note it, because it's extremely significant for how one interprets its findings.\n\nWhile policy influence mechanisms are practically non-representative for the mass of \"average voters\", that is, citizens who are not enrolled in one of the representative groups of either theories that the paper finds evidence for, the outcome of the policy influence mechanisms is still, by and large, aligned with the one that the average voters desire. It's not *fully* aligned, but that is both unsurprising and entirely expected -- there is no group, not even one of the well-represented groups, that gets all the outcomes they want, i.e. it's not fully aligned for anyone. Whether that's because these groups act as proxies to the wider population -- deliberately or not, i.e. because they take it upon themselves to do so or simply because they need to represent their interests to some degree in order to fulfill their outcomes -- is not something that the paper speculates on but it is nonetheless happening.\n\nThis isn't an entirely novel phenomenon. The conflict between preserving the will of the represented majority and avoiding the tyranny of that majority has been recognized for centuries, going back to 1791, when the Frech Constitution explicitly rejected the imperative mandate.\n\nWhile it can be argued that the American system is *too* non-representative -- which the paper does recognize when noting the major influence of interest groups, most of which do in fact advocate for policy that goes against what most citizens want --, it is still fundamentally different from that of a repressive state, where the interests of the under-represented majority and the over-represented ruling elites are fundamentally opposed, and yet the conflict is still consistently resolved in favour of the latter.\n\nSecond, both of the theories that the study finds statistical evidence for do explain influence over government policies in significantly non-representative terms. However, they are also theories that explain influence over government policies within a general, non-conflictual setting, independent of both individual political events and decisions and of their magnitude. They are general theories of policy making, *not* models of state functioning.\n\nNeither theory actually excludes citizen influence from all decisions. Practical experience has shown that there are plenty of things that simply don't happen without voter assent, including the ascension of some politicians to some positions. This does in fact impose practical limits on the exact policies being enacted.\n\nThis is kind of the big caveat of representing policy influence only by legislative outcome. On paper, the NRA has scored almost nothing but wins since the 1950s, so their influence does look quantitatively over-represented. But in practice, the trade, transport and use of firearms has been gradually restricted in the last 60 years, as most wins have been defensive (i.e. they obtained the preservation of some legal privilege rather than the enactment of new ones) and they amortized, rather than shaped policy.\n\nThis caveat doesn't diminish the findings of this paper in any way, you can't make a real statistical study without it. The importance of validating these theories quantitatively cannot be understated but it's also worth mentioning that it's not a surprising result. It's both accurately described by some political scientists (the paper cites them and their work) and actually overwhelmingly pointed out by historians, who tirelessly have to remind everyone that public opinion is a major influencing factor even in totalitarian states but decisions are ultimately made by individual people at the behest of other individual people. This is an unsurprising result even in terms of mechanisms alone: \"the general public\" does not have direct, unmediated access to its representatives -- individual voters can write to their representative or request on audience or whatever, but they're just one person; whereas, say, the NEA can send a representative to talk to a congressman and that representative will speak to them with the full authority of the citizens it's representing (and, within the paper's quantitative framework, possibly score a policy win for the NEA -- a professional group -- which won't be represented as a policy \"win\" for the citizens, even though the NEA is in fact representing at least some citizens, at least in some of its actions).\n\nYou can argue that it's not a desirable outcome, and that's probably right to some degree (I don't live in the US so I can't really comment on it). However it is far from equating the American (or most Western systems, for that matter) with one where the interests of mass-based groups and individual citizens are routinely unaligned with those of the more represented groups to the point where the latter have to routinely resolve to significant repression of the former, and where they have practically no moderating influence over government policy.\n\nEdit: FWIW this is a general problem of grand models. Any theory that attempts to explain something a phenomenon as intricate and as wide-reaching as the shaping of government policy is bound to be reductionist to some degree. That's why it's important to apply them as gauges for general trends, not explanations of individual events. I.e. they can give you an idea about what to look at when trying to answer questions like \"Why did the Vietnam war go on for so long\" or \"Why did the Reagan administration promote a policy of deregulation?\". But if you try to apply to answer questions like \"Why did Nixon resign?\" or \"Why did the US intervene in the Balkans in the 1990s\" it falls flat on its face, as lots and lots of individual decisions and events that occur *within the broader framework* of shaping policy are in fact immediately traceable to public opinion.",

If you compare protections for free speech in the US and the UK, the US has far stronger protections, to the extent it has real and pernicious consequences for british journalism. On the other hand, if you compare the UK and US on the topic of voter disenfranchisement, the UK comes out way ahead.\n\nIf we're going to talk about complicated pictures, the honest starting point would be to admit that every state is organized under principles that emerge from its specific history and conditions. As you have pointed out, even very repressive regimes are sensitive to public opinion, in some moments, acutely so, and the inverse is true of the most formally democratic nations. All states are repressive in different manners, and of different behaviours.\n\nI think the worst possible response to this complexity, however, is to uphold a basically instrumental distinction between 'democracies' and 'other', basically along the same lines as 'the west and the rest', without actually thinking about what constitutes democracy. \n\n> individual citizens are routinely unaligned with those of the more represented groups to the point where the latter have to routinely resolve to significant repression of the former, and where they have practically no moderating influence over government policy.\n\nTo me, that reads as a good description of very many states, especially if you look at a more granular level (e.g. Glasgow in the 1980's, Texas in the Jim Crow era). The problem is, if you strip democracy of its content ('rule by the people', not conflated with 'the majority'), you can excuse an awful lot of institutions that are obviously, provably, not delivering that outcome - because they formally resemble institutions on the 'democratic' side of an imaginary spectrum. I like the study because it proves that US democracy is not delivering one outcome we would all like it and expect it to. That's not to say, as you correctly argue, that it has no democratic features. Simply, that it is not fulfilling what we generally think of a s a core function.",

Unless this is the first step, ask what Ukraine wants, then the said 40 countries will have a separate meeting with Russia without Ukraine on the table and ask their 10-point peace plan also.</p>\n</div>",
