        "body": "\nFollowing the second-reading approval of the law about the enlistment of convicts by the Verkhovna Rada and Zelensky's signature on May 17, the first requests from inmates for getting parole in exchange for signing a contract to serve in a military unit are reaching Ukraine's district courts. In Khmelnytskyi, the day before yesterday, the first two convicts [received](https://ye.ua/syspilstvo/69313_Na_Hmelnichchini_dvom_uv_yaznenim_dozvolili_vstupiti_u_viysko__pershi_uhvali_sudu.html) court approval to leave prison so as to join the Defense Forces. \n\nTwo men, born in 1981 and 2000, currently imprisoned for thefts committed before the outbreak of the invasion and sentenced in autumn 2022 to, respectively, 4 years and 9 months and 5 years and 5 months, applied for such a procedure and then underwent examinations that ascertained their physical, health and mental status. After that, in video conference with the judge, they declared their willingness to defend the nation and to have the opportunity to sign a contract to be able to do so, seeing their request approved. The two men will reportedly serve in the National Guard.\n\nStarting next week they can be released and go to the city's TRC to sign a contract, accompanied by servicemen of the National Guard, and after that they will begin their training. According to what was announced by the Ministry of Justice, the convicts shall serve in separate units, likely in the style of the \u201cassault detachments\u201d that numerous Ukrainian brigades have, where soldiers from other brigades accused of desertion, theft, drug/sex offenses etc, are sent. Apparently, units of the National Guard will be the first to host this type of new penal unit to host the convicts. They will most likely be used as stormtroopers to hold the zero line and/or as sappers to dig trenches and fortifications near the front line, i.e. where it's most dangerous to do so. \n\nThey will not be allowed to leave the headquarters of their military unit and will be allowed to travel for personal reasons only with the approval of their commander, who by law becomes their supervisor. The law stipulates that in the case of desertion, abandonment of the unit etc, the convict shall return to prison, where he will finish serving his original sentence and in addition will be sentenced to an additional 5 to 10 years in jail. According to the approved legislation, convicts who have past experience in the Armed Forces will be able to join them with the last rank they had, including NCO and officer ranks, although I assume these cases are rare. \n\nThe Khmelnytskyi District Court is analyzing another 50 similar applications. Nationwide, more than 3,000 requests have already reached the district courts. At the moment there are nearly 26,000 adult men in Ukrainian jails, but those convicted of very serious crimes and crimes against sexual freedom or the nation as well as those affected by HIV, hepatitis and tuberculosis will not be allowed to serve. According to a survey of the Ministry of Justice conducted in April, 4,500 convicts expressed their willingness to join the ranks of the Defense Forces. The ministry estimates that from 10 to 20 thousand convicts meet the requirements to serve. Obviously, not all of them are willing to do so, but number of applications is expected to continue to grow significantly in the future. Let's recall that (this is something approved just after the invasion began, it has nothing to do with this law) every month from 300 to 500 Ukrainian citizens which are being investigated for crimes (not convicted) avail themselves of the opportunity to sign a contract and join the ranks of the UAF in exchange for the suspension of criminal proceedings against them. \n\nObviously, Russia could count on much higher numbers, given its very high prison population, back in 2022. PMC Wagner alone claims to have recruited 49 thousand convicts and in all likelihood a larger to considerably larger amount have joined the \u201cStorm-Z\u201d detachments of the MoD, which today have become \u201cStorm-V\u201d with far worse conditions: the convict is on parole and will have to serve until the end of \u201cSMO\u201d; unlike before, when the convict received amnesty and had to serve \u201conly\u201d 6 months at the front. Today the number of enlisted convicts in Russian ranks has dropped a lot compared to the last year for obvious reasons, but there's definitely still an ongoing monthly flow, as one would logically expect looking at their prison population and counting the new flows into Russian jails.\n\nWe all know about the extremely ruthless methods adopted by Russia to make this system work, and overall I think it has been a success for them. It will be very interesting to see how well it will work for the Ukrainian side and how their convicts will perform. There is only one small precedent: when Kyiv was under threat in February 2022, about 300 convicts from jails in the capital were pardoned and released, after pledging to join the UAF. It had mixed results: the convicts were allowed to walk out of prison on their own (which will not be the case today) - a good portion joined military units and performed their duties with good results, another portion did not show up and went into hiding.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of Ukrainians who have uploaded their information \nthrough the \u201cReserv+\u201d app [has risen](https://kyiv24.news/news/zastosunok-rezerv-zafiksuvav-805-tysyach-onovlen-danyh-minoborony) to 805,000 as of yesterday, with several thousands uploading their data despite being residents abroad (let's remember current servicemen don't have to upload their data).\n\nIn addition, the Verkhovna Rada is working on a project to reform the \u201creservation\u201d system, i.e. the one that allows companies to exempt all or a part of their workers from mobilization, if the company is active in a sector deemed critical to the national interest. According to [proposals](https://biz.censor.net/news/3491005/stefanchuk_prokomentuvav_ideyu_ekonomichnogo_bronyuvannya_vid_mobilizatsiyi) under discussion, the system will be reformed by forcing companies to pay 20 thousand Hryvnias per month for each employee they want to \"book\", i.e. make exempt from mobilization (basically as much as an average Ukrainian monthly gross salary): a very high figure in relation to the cost of labor in Ukraine and that's in addition to existing taxes. The Federation of Employers of Ukraine, after discussions with its members, has agreed to pay 6 thousand Hryvnias per month per exempt employee. It's likely going to be a long debate. In addition, this proposal is criticized as it could bring out discrimination on economic terms: for instance, an IT company (recently [authorized](https://biz.censor.net/news/3489963/kabmin_dozvolyv_bronyuvaty_100_pratsivnykiv_operatoriv_zvyazku_itkompaniyi) by the Ukrainian government to defer 100% of their employees!) getting its revenue from foreign markets could afford to pay the reservation and make all its employees exempt, like a company in the banking-insurance sector, while a company working with the domestic market or even a parastatal one might not be able to afford such costs - for example, several local public transport companies complain that they may have to cut rides because of the mobilization of their workers, and are trying to hire women to avoid that.\n\nThis measure is necessary to find the funds to train, equip and pay the people who will be mobilized as the new mobilization law takes effect. A new mobilized person needs to be supported by 4/5 \"booked\" employees. By government estimates, this proposal would yield between 200 and 350 billion Hryvnias per year (5 to 8,8 billion US Dollars).",

After that, the Ukrainians sent in reinforcements and the situation somewhat stabilized (also thanks to the favors rendered by the hydrology of the area); although the Russians, as elsewhere, have the momentum. That is the &quot;normality&quot; of this war after all. </p>\n\n<p>Over the next week I will make a new update, hoping that by then several doubts I have right now about the status of certain areas along the front line will be clarified.</p>\n</div>",

The constant drumbeat asserting **\u201cthe Essequibo is ours,\u201d** alongside the creation of new military commands and legal structures to oversee the defense of the region, is helping to institutionalize a sense of perpetual prewar footing. Even if Maduro were to cut a lopsided deal with Guyana for access to offshore oil blocks, he likely could not easily de-escalate and swiftly dismantle institutions like the new Integral Defense Operations Zone charged with managing the Essequibo. Doing so would provoke fierce resistance from within the armed forces, who have seen their stature grow in Venezuelan politics and society while eagerly embracing their role as the vanguard of Venezuela\u2019s sovereignty claims over long-denied territory. De-escalation could even disqualify Maduro\u2019s presidential bid, as Venezuela\u2019s Essequibo defense law (passed by the Chavista-controlled National Assembly) bars anyone who denies Venezuelan sovereignty over the Essequibo from running for public office. \n\nAny of that rhetoric sound familiar? The report includes satellite imagery of Venezuelan military infrastructure improvements near the border but the overall key limitation remains: the Venezuela-Guyana border is dense jungle with no easy path through.

[This](https://x.com/bayraktar_1love/status/1793733999539671265) video claims to show their launch, capturing 8 missiles in the air. Air defense is also visibly active.

However, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, speaking in Kyiv last week, told reporters he did not believe Putin was interested in serious negotiations.\"\n\n* Putin will agree to a ceasefire if Russia is allowed to keep the land it has already annexed, but this is an absolute non-negotiable.\n\n* \"\"Putin will say that we won, that NATO attacked us and we kept our sovereignty, that we have a land corridor to Crimea, which is true,\" one of them said, giving their own analysis.\"\n\n* \"In the absence of a ceasefire, Putin wants to take as much territory as possible to ratchet up pressure on Ukraine while seeking to exploit unexpected opportunities to acquire more, three of the sources said.\"\n\n* \"Putin will slowly conquer territories until Zelenskiy comes up with an offer to stop, the person said, saying the Russian leader had expressed the view to aides that the West would not provide enough weapons, sapping Ukraine's morale.\"\n\n* \"All five sources said Putin had told advisers he had no designs on NATO territory, reflecting his public comments on the matter.

        "body": "An article that contains commentary on Ukraine's use of the MALD.  The article below is taking from remarks made by Military expert Serhiy Zgurets on the Espreso TV channel.\n\n[Ukrainian MiG-29s Equipped with the Capacity to Use ADM-160 MALD Decoys | Defense Express | May 2024](https://en.defence-ua.com/weapon_and_tech/ukrainian_mig_29s_equipped_with_the_capacity_to_use_adm_160_mald_decoys-10593.html)\n\n*\"The decoys used by the Ukrainian Air Force have been in use for a long time. The first use was back in May 2023. That is, when a strike was launched against Russian targets. These American so-called ADM-160 MALD decoys are a drone that resembles a missile. During the flight, it can generate an electric field around it of such quality that the enemy cannot understand whether it is a cruise missile, a fighter or a bomber. And the enemy is forced to turn on its air defense systems to repel the attack of this false target, which it mistakes for a real target,\" Zgurets explained.*\n\n*According to a military expert, the range of the ADM-160 MALD decoy is about 400 km.*\n\n*\"Our MiG-29 fighters and other aircraft use these decoys as the first element of an attack on Russian air defense systems. Because right after this decoy, a HARM anti-radar missile flies, which is launched either from a MiG-29 or a Su-27 and destroys Russian air defense systems. This \u201csweet couple\u201d has been working for over a year to destroy enemy air defense systems. There are questions about how to further scale this use. It is necessary to transfer such strikes to the territory of the Russian federation,\" Zgurets stressed.*\n\nAnother article that contains commentary/claims from a UAF representative on how they have been shooting down Russian Su-25s in May.  There has never been good evidence for most of these claimed shootdowns so we don't know if they are true or an attempt to make the Russians think twice about continuing the sorties.  (I can't imagine the thought process behind hoping these claims would do that.  If anyone knows if the sorties come back or not it's the Russians.) \n\n[\u200bThe Armed Forces of Ukraine Disclose Details of Fifth Su-25 Aircraft Downed in May | Defense Express | May 2024](https://en.defence-ua.com/news/the_armed_forces_of_ukraine_disclose_details_of_fifth_su_25_aircraft_downed_in_may-10597.html)\n\n*The Armed Forces of Ukraine have disclosed details about the downing of the fifth Russian Su-25 attack aircraft in May 2024, which was shot down on May 22, 2024, in the Pokrovske direction.*\n\n*\u201cThey constantly change routes. Before the aircraft comes in, they start firing the area with machine guns to kill our guys. They throw mines. They are already angry with us, this is the fifth aircraft. They are trying to kill us,\" the brigade representative said.*\n\n*The representative did not disclose how exactly and with what weapon the aircraft was shot down.*\n\n*\u201cRegarding how it was shot down, we cannot disclose that.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>An article that contains commentary on Ukraine&#39;s use of the MALD.  The article below is taking from remarks made by Military expert Serhiy Zgurets on the Espreso TV channel.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.defence-ua.com/weapon_and_tech/ukrainian_mig_29s_equipped_with_the_capacity_to_use_adm_160_mald_decoys-10593.html\">Ukrainian MiG-29s Equipped with the Capacity to Use ADM-160 MALD Decoys | Defense Express | May 2024</a></p>\n\n<p><em>&quot;The decoys used by the Ukrainian Air Force have been in use for a long time. The first use was back in May 2023. That is, when a strike was launched against Russian targets. These American so-called ADM-160 MALD decoys are a drone that resembles a missile. During the flight, it can generate an electric field around it of such quality that the enemy cannot understand whether it is a cruise missile, a fighter or a bomber. And the enemy is forced to turn on its air defense systems to repel the attack of this false target, which it mistakes for a real target,&quot; Zgurets explained.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>According to a military expert, the range of the ADM-160 MALD decoy is about 400 km.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>&quot;Our MiG-29 fighters and other aircraft use these decoys as the first element of an attack on Russian air defense systems. Because right after this decoy, a HARM anti-radar missile flies, which is launched either from a MiG-29 or a Su-27 and destroys Russian air defense systems. This \u201csweet couple\u201d has been working for over a year to destroy enemy air defense systems. There are questions about how to further scale this use. It is necessary to transfer such strikes to the territory of the Russian federation,&quot; Zgurets stressed.</em></p>\n\n<p>Another article that contains commentary/claims from a UAF representative on how they have been shooting down Russian Su-25s in May.  There has never been good evidence for most of these claimed shootdowns so we don&#39;t know if they are true or an attempt to make the Russians think twice about continuing the sorties.  (I can&#39;t imagine the thought process behind hoping these claims would do that.  If anyone knows if the sorties come back or not it&#39;s the Russians.) </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.defence-ua.com/news/the_armed_forces_of_ukraine_disclose_details_of_fifth_su_25_aircraft_downed_in_may-10597.html\">\u200bThe Armed Forces of Ukraine Disclose Details of Fifth Su-25 Aircraft Downed in May | Defense Express | May 2024</a></p>\n\n<p><em>The Armed Forces of Ukraine have disclosed details about the downing of the fifth Russian Su-25 attack aircraft in May 2024, which was shot down on May 22, 2024, in the Pokrovske direction.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cThey constantly change routes.

An ISW May 22 report called the situation in the town \u201cdynamic.\u201d*\n\n*There was close-in combat and firefights along the length of the Vovcha River that cuts through the town east and west, and terrain gains and losses were measured in dozens of meters, those independent reports said.*\n\n*Russian attacks were continuing with local commanders sending small infantry teams forward to attack terrain on the front line, and launching glider bomb and artillery strikes at military and civilian targets in the Ukrainians\u2019 rear area.*\n\n*Russian air strikes injured thirteen civilians, among them a child, in attacks hitting the nearby major city Kharkiv \u2013 Ukraine\u2019s second largest \u2013 on Wednesday morning, a statement from Ukraine\u2019s Ministry of Emergency Situations said.*\n\n*Russia, in early May, committed a reported 20,000+ men to open a new active fighting front against Ukraine in the Kharkiv sector, according to Russian leader Vladimir Putin, to slice out territory at least 40 kilometers deep into Ukraine to prevent Kyiv\u2019s forces from shooting at targets across the border inside the Russian Federation.*\n\n*The Kremlin assaults in early May grabbed two swaths of land, each some 10 kilometers wide and 5 kilometers deep, capturing eight villages. Further attacks have stalled against Ukrainian defenses built on reserve units quickly deployed to the sector, massed FPV drone strikes, and \u2013 as had been effectively absent from Kyiv\u2019s arsenal since January \u2013 long-awaited deliveries of useful quantities of NATO-standard howitzer shells.*\n\n*Ukrainian forces since Monday have launched local counterattacks in and around Vovchansk, retaking about half the town and capturing dozens of prisoners. Sources agreed the veteran 82nd Air Assault Brigade was leading the assaults, backed by special forces units from the army and border troops command. In a May 22 national video address, President Volodymyr Zelensky said the crack brigade had become the keystone of defenses in the Kharkiv sector.*\n\n*Video published by the 82nd on its own news feeds on Monday and Tuesday showed US-manufactured Stryker armored personnel carriers moving through Vovchansk\u2019s streets at careful speed and using hit-and-run tactics to blast possible targets with heavy machine gun fire.*\n\n*A report by Ukraine\u2019s independent ICTV television channel said the brigade \u201crecently\u201d destroyed two companies of Russian troops \u2013 a force normally numbering between 200-300 men \u2013 in fighting in the town.*\n\n*A formation raised in Ukraine\u2019s far-western, massively multi-ethnic Chernivtsi region, the 82nd Brigade is accounted one of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU\u2019s) most powerful fighting formations because of a successful fighting record dating to the first days of the war. It is heavily armed with some of the most powerful fighting vehicles Ukraine\u2019s Western allies have sent to the AFU, including British Challenger 2 tanks and US-made Stryker armored personnel carriers.*\n\n*The Kremlin advance has been stopped and urban warfare teams from the 82nd are moving to clear the town of Russian infantry, the TV report said, in interviews with unit soldiers. A soldier identified as Ivan told ICTV: \u201cWe have succeeded in throwing them (Russian forces) back a bit.\u201d*\n\n*Ukraine-run chat groups and information platforms tracking Russian service personnel dead and captured have seen an uptick in reports of soldiers captured in the Kharkiv region since mid-May, with most of the alleged new POWs becoming Ukrainian captives in Vovchansk. A survey of one of the oldest and most-read tracking groups, called I Will Wait (or its Russian-language version \u0414\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0443\u0441\u044c \u0442\u0435\u0431\u044f) since May 15 has seen a near-tripling of reported captures of Russian troops by Ukrainian forces. A Kyiv Post review of the OSINT data showed that close to two-thirds of captures reported from May 15-23 came from battles in the Kharkiv sector, almost all in Vovchansk.*\n\n*Individuals purportedly captured numbered at least 28 men. Most, but not all, soldiers were identified by name, rank, unit, and service number. It was not possible to determine how many Russians \u2013 if any \u2013 had been captured by the 82nd Brigade, which is one of at least four major Ukrainian formations known to be fighting in the Kharkiv sector.*\n\n*Units of assignment of the captured Russian soldiers, when stated, were consistent with combat formations known to be fielded by Moscow in the Kharkiv attacks, among them 9th Motor Rifle Regiment, 11th Tank Regiment, 128th Motor Rifle Regiment, 144th Motor Rifle Division, 228th Guards Motor Rifle Regiment, and 237th Tank Regiment. Losses seemed to be heaviest in the tank regiments, Kyiv Post researchers found.*\n\n*One Russian soldier was identified as Moscow resident Sergei Mamaev, a rifleman in the 9th Motor Rifle Regiment. According to his account, he was ordered to advance towards the Kharkiv region village Liptsy and dig in, but he and his unit came under artillery and mortar fire aimed at the armored vehicles they were riding in. Ukrainian FPV drones came next and hunted down individual soldiers trying to hide. Ukrainian infantry mopped up the battlefield the next day and took survivors prisoner, he said.*\n\n*Mamayev and other soldiers in videos stated they were frustrated with the Russian national leadership\u2019s strategy of throwing poorly-trained troops into the teeth of prepared Russian defenses, that unit casualties commonly exceed 50 percent in a single attack, and that survivors if captured receive good treatment from Ukrainian forces.*",

It's a great bit of PR, it's relatively costly (probably $50/100M of damage and replacement cost, these newer Voronezh radars are much cheaper than the Daryal and Dnestr types from the USSR) and at a time when Ukraine are under immense pressure it can demonstrate to partners and aid suppliers that the war is still viable. \n\nThat all being said, I'm not sure of the immediate utility relative to the risk, removing early warning sites are going to have serious implications at the security paranoid upper levels of the Russian armed forces and political elite, this is not a path I'd recommend going down and would much prefer they stick to conventional or energy focused infrastructure targets as opposed to early warning sites, this could start a chain of decisions that drag us closer to war than any other more conventional tit for tat that is going on in and outside of Ukraine right now. \n\nAlso to add to u/qwamqwamqwam2, this is most certainly not cosmetic damage.

Putting people in prison after they commit crimes is not &quot;holding them hostage.&quot; There is no article in international law that allows non-combatants to ever be abducted, tortured and raped.</p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re going to grandstand, let me grandstand back - it&#39;s genuinely disgusting to pit oppressed peoples against one another like it&#39;s some kind of a contest for your own amusement. And even in doing so, you&#39;re not even correct on the facts. Russia likely has killed far more civilians, and it&#39;s not from a lack of trying that Russia hasn&#39;t killed more.</p>\n</div>",
