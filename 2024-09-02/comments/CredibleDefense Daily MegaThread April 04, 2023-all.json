        "body": "In recent weeks and months, I've seen discussions about conscription and demographics in Ukraine. I want to clarify that I speak Russian and some Ukrainian, and I lived in Ukraine (but I was not born there, nor am I Ukrainian) until the end of 2021. Since the war, I have volunteered at refugee centers and helped Ukrainian refugees. However, my experience is limited and based on what I've heard and observed personally and I do not state any facts just to make this clear.\r  \n\r  \nThat out of the way, I want to share some of my experience. First, on the issue of how easy it is for the male population to just leave. I can't emphasize enough how generally the majority of people are women and children. There are men too, but most either have already left pre-war, have exemptions (mostly due to children or health issues), or otherwise have mostly legally left the country. Of course, I have encountered or heard of people leaving illegally too. Options include forging documents for university, leaving through Russian-occupied territory, or being just wealthy enough, among others.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, I think people overstate how easy it is. I have countless stories of wives or daughters who desperately want their husband or father to be able to leave, but there is no viable option. Furthermore, on the issue of how much people want to return: Generally, most people I encounter say or give off the vibe that they indeed do want to return. It helps to remember that the vast majority of Ukrainians own their apartment/house and left quite a lot of their stuff behind. Some went back and forth or asked family members who went back to bring more stuff. But still, I think generally this makes it a lot easier for people to return.\r  \n\r  \nIn the first months of the war, and I think this also explains the huge number of people who have returned, many really did not want to integrate into the host country, felt frustrated, and were disappointed by \"the West\" (as in they expected much more). There were constant complaints and problems. I think the cultural differences played a heavy role and the lack of language knowledge. Most speak pretty bad english, virtually none the host countries language.\r  \n\r  \nAgain, I can speak only from my experience, but I do think most people intend to return if they haven't already (which were a lot). The infrastructure attacks spoiled many return plans too. I think that always gets overlooked. It heavily discouraged people from returning but also sparked a small new wave of refugees. In conclusion on this, I just want to say that I think once summer begins, more people will return.\r  \n\r  \nBut aside from infrastructure attacks, what discourages more young people from returning is the lack of job opportunities. From what I heard, they are pretty dire nowadays. On a last note, I just want to say that, by far, the biggest factor influencing the number of people returning versus staying is how long this war drags on. Many mothers and their children do not want to return until it is indisputably safe (a attiude that changed also with the infracstructure attacks). But their children are being enrolled in local education  and generally adapt quite well. And if you had asked me at this time one year ago, the absolute vast majority said they want to return, and they are going to do so. Now, it's a mixed bag; people settle and get used to living outside of Ukraine.\n\nI could really tell a lot of stories or share more but my comment is already pretty long, so I would just say at this point I rather would accept questions than write more.",

Also check out the WOTR podcast episode below that covers some of this. Thread. 1/\n\n> The Russian offensive in the Donbas has not yet ended, but it has weakened in pace of operations and intensity. Having achieved little, Russian forces are probably preparing to shift to a defensive posture in anticipation of a Ukrainian offensive. 2/\n\n> At Vuhledar Russian forces fed the better parts of two brigades into UA minefields and ATGMs, then eventually switched to Avdiivka. There they created a partial encirclement, but UA may have stabilized the situation at this point (its unclear). 3/\n\n> Many of the complaint videos seem to come from around Avdiivka, where Russian mobilized territorial troops have been assigned to the DNR\u2019s corps. They are being rotated onto the battlefield probably in battalion or company sized elements and thrown into infantry assaults. 4/\n\n> Other battlefields: Kreminna -> Lyman, Bilohorivka, Marinka, could be summarized as see-saw battles where RU struggled to attain an advantage. Overall, RU force quality appears insufficient to restore offensive potential, hence most attacks are by VDV or Naval Infantry. 5/\n\n> Consequently, the Russian offensive is going about as poorly as expected. The question is how much will Russian forces exhaust themselves and be forced to ration ammunition. Putin has publicly commented on artillery ammunition constraints forcing them to limit use. 6/\n\n> I hold to the argument in an earlier thread, that Gerasimov is exhausting the force with an ill-timed  feckless set of offensive operations, whose gains will not change the strategic picture for Russia, but could leave Russian forces more vulnerable. 7/ [linked thread] (https://twitter.com/KofmanMichael/status/1627309427907854336?t=87nNAEKzR6tO5On-ZG_Lbg&s=19)\n\n> Meanwhile, UA is building out a sizable additional force: three corps, consisting of six maneuver brigades, and supporting elements. How many of these units will be complete and trained by the time of the offensive is unknown. 8/\n\n> Some brigades will be equipped entirely with Western AFVs. However, they may be composed of recently mobilized personnel, and on a very tight training regimen. Operating cohesively as units, and attempting combined arms maneuver may prove difficult. 9/\n\n> My impression is that capability gaps remain in breaching equipment, mine clearing, combat engineering, bridging, support, and core items like communication, night vision, ISR. 10/\n\n> The Russian military likely has the manpower and reserves to mount a stubborn defense, along with minefields and entrenchments. This doesn't mean UA can't break RU lines, but past offensives suggest that UA has challenges sustaining momentum after a breakthrough is achieved. 11/\n\n> Turning briefly to manpower, the Russian military still has a long-term manpower problem. The leadership is keen to avoid another mobilization wave. At this stage they are attempting to recruit 400k contract servicemen instead. 12/\n\n> There is a nation-wide contract service recruitment drive with advertisements and mobile recruitment centers across Russia. Draft notices still go out seeking to update information and pressure people into signing contracts. 13/\n\n> Regions likely have quotas & state enterprises are used as recruitment instruments. This was tried last year, and the results proved underwhelming. While elements of Russian society support, or acquiesce to the war, most do not want to participate despite the money offered. 14/\n\n> Hence I suspect that to rotate forces and replace losses Moscow will resort to mobilization once again later this year. My guess is that if there is another mobilization wave, then it will be summer/fall, depending on what happens on the battlefield. 15/\n\n> Russia has just begun processing the biannual conscript intake, enrolling 147,000, a significant increase compared to recent years. For more on this check out CIT\u2019s recent posts. 16/ [linked thread](https://twitter.com/CITeam_en/status/1641901150424162304?t=mJRhzm4rogidgGd6jZemwg&s=19)\n\n> Turning to Bakhmut. Over the past couple weeks RU changed approach, advancing northwest of the city towards the water canal, and into the city itself along three sides. While UA forces have not been encircled, the situation remains precarious, and unstable. Map March. 17/ [map](https://twitter.com/KofmanMichael/status/1643232934449618947?t=RrImNXGXkDIiPkDzVNX2iQ&s=19)\n\n> The reason why RU changed approach is unclear: inability to sever the supply route, force exhaustion, concern over exposed flanks, infighting between Wagner and GenStaff, or concerns about committing reserves and getting fixed at Bakhmut as Ukraine\u2019s spring offensive looms. 18/\n\n> In Bakhmut UA sought to attrition Russian forces and fix them long enough to launch the spring offensive. But, the evidence is scant that UA still enjoys a significantly favorable attrition ratio, or that it is fixing a substantial Russian force. 19/\n\n> Whether holding Bakhmut makes military sense is best judged later. This is an incomplete picture at best, and UA has no easy options: hold, withdraw, counter attack, move up spring offensive timing. But over the past month Wagner forces have advanced further into the city. 20/\n\n> The reason Bakhmut matters is not because it will directly impede UA offensive prospects, but because force quality is difficult to regenerate (and ammo finite). What UA spends now it may miss later this year when the offensive is over, and may struggle to sustain momentum. 21/\n\n> The Ukrainian military is better motivated and more adaptable than Russia\u2019s, but after more than a year of fighting force quality issues have risen to the fore, and there are internal clashes as two military cultures uncomfortably coexist within the same army. 22/\n\n> UA cannot afford to be profligate, because what follows a series of successful offensives could prove similar to the attritional period December-February. Even if an outright military victory is achieved, the war may continue as a cross-border war of attrition. 23/\n\n> To get past short-termism in the conversation it is important to consider what will follow Ukraine\u2019s offensive. US and European countries can sustain Ukraine's war effort, but may not be able to provide a decisive military advantage over RU for some time after this period. 24/\n\n> Consequently, UA has a critical window of opportunity, which will set expectations. UA has consistently overperformed, while RU forces underperformed, relative to expectations. Hence I am cautiously optimistic, but concerned about the uncertainty on what will follow. 25/",

Operating cohesively as units, and attempting combined arms maneuver may prove difficult. 9/</p>\n\n<p>My impression is that capability gaps remain in breaching equipment, mine clearing, combat engineering, bridging, support, and core items like communication, night vision, ISR. 10/</p>\n\n<p>The Russian military likely has the manpower and reserves to mount a stubborn defense, along with minefields and entrenchments. This doesn&#39;t mean UA can&#39;t break RU lines, but past offensives suggest that UA has challenges sustaining momentum after a breakthrough is achieved. 11/</p>\n\n<p>Turning briefly to manpower, the Russian military still has a long-term manpower problem. The leadership is keen to avoid another mobilization wave. At this stage they are attempting to recruit 400k contract servicemen instead. 12/</p>\n\n<p>There is a nation-wide contract service recruitment drive with advertisements and mobile recruitment centers across Russia. Draft notices still go out seeking to update information and pressure people into signing contracts. 13/</p>\n\n<p>Regions likely have quotas &amp; state enterprises are used as recruitment instruments. This was tried last year, and the results proved underwhelming. While elements of Russian society support, or acquiesce to the war, most do not want to participate despite the money offered. 14/</p>\n\n<p>Hence I suspect that to rotate forces and replace losses Moscow will resort to mobilization once again later this year. My guess is that if there is another mobilization wave, then it will be summer/fall, depending on what happens on the battlefield. 15/</p>\n\n<p>Russia has just begun processing the biannual conscript intake, enrolling 147,000, a significant increase compared to recent years. For more on this check out CIT\u2019s recent posts. 16/ <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CITeam_en/status/1641901150424162304?t=mJRhzm4rogidgGd6jZemwg&amp;s=19\">linked thread</a></p>\n\n<p>Turning to Bakhmut. Over the past couple weeks RU changed approach, advancing northwest of the city towards the water canal, and into the city itself along three sides. While UA forces have not been encircled, the situation remains precarious, and unstable. Map March. 17/ <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KofmanMichael/status/1643232934449618947?t=RrImNXGXkDIiPkDzVNX2iQ&amp;s=19\">map</a></p>\n\n<p>The reason why RU changed approach is unclear: inability to sever the supply route, force exhaustion, concern over exposed flanks, infighting between Wagner and GenStaff, or concerns about committing reserves and getting fixed at Bakhmut as Ukraine\u2019s spring offensive looms. 18/</p>\n\n<p>In Bakhmut UA sought to attrition Russian forces and fix them long enough to launch the spring offensive. But, the evidence is scant that UA still enjoys a significantly favorable attrition ratio, or that it is fixing a substantial Russian force. 19/</p>\n\n<p>Whether holding Bakhmut makes military sense is best judged later. This is an incomplete picture at best, and UA has no easy options: hold, withdraw, counter attack, move up spring offensive timing. But over the past month Wagner forces have advanced further into the city. 20/</p>\n\n<p>The reason Bakhmut matters is not because it will directly impede UA offensive prospects, but because force quality is difficult to regenerate (and ammo finite). What UA spends now it may miss later this year when the offensive is over, and may struggle to sustain momentum. 21/</p>\n\n<p>The Ukrainian military is better motivated and more adaptable than Russia\u2019s, but after more than a year of fighting force quality issues have risen to the fore, and there are internal clashes as two military cultures uncomfortably coexist within the same army. 22/</p>\n\n<p>UA cannot afford to be profligate, because what follows a series of successful offensives could prove similar to the attritional period December-February. Even if an outright military victory is achieved, the war may continue as a cross-border war of attrition. 23/</p>\n\n<p>To get past short-termism in the conversation it is important to consider what will follow Ukraine\u2019s offensive. US and European countries can sustain Ukraine&#39;s war effort, but may not be able to provide a decisive military advantage over RU for some time after this period. 24/</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, UA has a critical window of opportunity, which will set expectations. UA has consistently overperformed, while RU forces underperformed, relative to expectations. Hence I am cautiously optimistic, but concerned about the uncertainty on what will follow. 25/</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

The move not only salvaged the UK satellite company\u2019s bid to create a global broadband internet network in the skies, but also signaled India\u2019s ambitions in the sector. \n\n>Demand for high-speed internet delivered from space has made launching satellites into orbit a prosperous business. By 2025, the so-called space economy is projected to grow to $600 billion from $447 billion in 2020, according to Ernst & Young estimates.\n\n>Along with Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX, Russia and China have been the main providers of satellite launches, given their long-running state space programs. But the war in Ukraine and Beijing\u2019s tensions with the US mean they\u2019re now off limits to many would-be customers. OneWeb turned to India after Russia scuppered the original launch last year, taking 36 of its spacecraft hostage.\n\n>At the same time, France\u2019s Arianespace has suffered problems getting its newest rocket ready for use. And Virgin Orbit Holdings Inc., the satellite-launch company tied to British billionaire Richard Branson, said last week that it was ceasing operations indefinitely following a launch failure in January.\n\n>\u201cIf SpaceX is full, busy or expensive, you have to look elsewhere \u2013 and you can\u2019t look at China,\u201d said Dallas Kasaboski, principal analyst with Northern Sky Research, a space research and consulting firm. \u201cChina can\u2019t work with North America and the US drives the majority of demand.\u201d\n\n>\u201cPolitically, India is in a much better place,\u201d he said.\n\n>Chinese rockets aren\u2019t good options for many satellite operators, partly because of growing concerns about Beijing accessing Western technology. By contrast, India has moved closer to the US and other regional powers, including Australia and Japan, and the country\u2019s launches cost less than other rivals.\n\n>Developing the space sector is a key plank of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s \u201cMake in India\u201d campaign, which aims to position the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy as a top destination for technological innovation. His administration has tried to make India\u2019s space agency more business friendly by encouraging the growth of startups.\n\n>\u201cDemand is so huge,\u201d said D. Radhakrishnan, the chairman and managing director of NewSpace, which was created in 2019 as the commercial arm of the national space agency, the India Space Research Organisation. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of shortage of the heavy-lift launchers that will be required.\u201d\n\n>>Taking on China\n\n>NewSpace should help India compete on the global stage. The March 26 launch follows a successful operation in October, when the company launched another 36 satellites for OneWeb. NewSpace is ramping up production of India\u2019s largest domestically developed rocket \u2014 the LVM3.\n\n>Neil Masterson, the chief executive of OneWeb, said NewSpace has \u201ca real opportunity to be a mainstream commercial launch provider.\u201d Last fiscal year, the company posted revenue of 17 billion rupees ($210 million) and profit of 3 billion rupees ($41 million). NewSpace provided satellite launch services for 52 international customers.\n\n>More broadly, India\u2019s industry is on track for significant growth. In 2020, the government eased rules for private sector satellite and rocket companies, allowing them to carry out independent space activities instead of being solely the suppliers to ISRO. The reforms mean that startups can also access ISRO\u2019s facilities, such as launchpads and laboratories. By 2025, the value of India\u2019s satellite launch services could almost double to $1 billion.\n\n>India still has far to go before it catches China. As of March 2020, China owned 13.6% of all earth-orbiting satellites, compared to 2.3% for India, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank in Washington.\n\n>Last year, China conducted 64 launches, the Communist Party-backed newspaper Global Times reported. While most private companies in China are still developing their rockets, a few have managed orbital launches on their own. In March 2022, the Beijing-based startup GalaxySpace placed six communications satellites into low-earth orbit and rival Galactic Energy, also headquartered in China\u2019s capital, added five more in January.\n\n>By comparison, India managed five similar launches last year \u2014 all of them by ISRO or NewSpace. Only a few are planned for 2023.\n\n>>Ensuring Reliability\n\n>In the past, India\u2019s rockets have also suffered from reliability issues. The country\u2019s success rate in recent years of about 70% compares poorly to rates in the 90s for rockets from the US, Europe, Russia or China, according to Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Center for Astrophysics, which is operated by Harvard University and the Smithsonian Institution.\n\n>But even with that backdrop, India is doing well, he said. The nation remains a popular choice for cost-efficient launches: In 2013, India sent an orbiter to Mars for a 10th of the price of a NASA probe that went the same year.\n\n>\u201cThere aren\u2019t many players that have a large-capacity launch vehicle that\u2019s cheap,\u201d McDowell said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not China or Russia.\u201d",

His administration has tried to make India\u2019s space agency more business friendly by encouraging the growth of startups.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDemand is so huge,\u201d said D. Radhakrishnan, the chairman and managing director of NewSpace, which was created in 2019 as the commercial arm of the national space agency, the India Space Research Organisation. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of shortage of the heavy-lift launchers that will be required.\u201d</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Taking on China</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>NewSpace should help India compete on the global stage. The March 26 launch follows a successful operation in October, when the company launched another 36 satellites for OneWeb. NewSpace is ramping up production of India\u2019s largest domestically developed rocket \u2014 the LVM3.</p>\n\n<p>Neil Masterson, the chief executive of OneWeb, said NewSpace has \u201ca real opportunity to be a mainstream commercial launch provider.\u201d Last fiscal year, the company posted revenue of 17 billion rupees ($210 million) and profit of 3 billion rupees ($41 million). NewSpace provided satellite launch services for 52 international customers.</p>\n\n<p>More broadly, India\u2019s industry is on track for significant growth. In 2020, the government eased rules for private sector satellite and rocket companies, allowing them to carry out independent space activities instead of being solely the suppliers to ISRO. The reforms mean that startups can also access ISRO\u2019s facilities, such as launchpads and laboratories. By 2025, the value of India\u2019s satellite launch services could almost double to $1 billion.</p>\n\n<p>India still has far to go before it catches China. As of March 2020, China owned 13.6% of all earth-orbiting satellites, compared to 2.3% for India, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank in Washington.</p>\n\n<p>Last year, China conducted 64 launches, the Communist Party-backed newspaper Global Times reported. While most private companies in China are still developing their rockets, a few have managed orbital launches on their own. In March 2022, the Beijing-based startup GalaxySpace placed six communications satellites into low-earth orbit and rival Galactic Energy, also headquartered in China\u2019s capital, added five more in January.</p>\n\n<p>By comparison, India managed five similar launches last year \u2014 all of them by ISRO or NewSpace. Only a few are planned for 2023.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ensuring Reliability</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the past, India\u2019s rockets have also suffered from reliability issues. The country\u2019s success rate in recent years of about 70% compares poorly to rates in the 90s for rockets from the US, Europe, Russia or China, according to Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Center for Astrophysics, which is operated by Harvard University and the Smithsonian Institution.</p>\n\n<p>But even with that backdrop, India is doing well, he said. The nation remains a popular choice for cost-efficient launches: In 2013, India sent an orbiter to Mars for a 10th of the price of a NASA probe that went the same year.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t many players that have a large-capacity launch vehicle that\u2019s cheap,\u201d McDowell said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not China or Russia.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

                            "body": "> But it seems that draw down is for pretty mundane things no?\n\nNot exactly. While the particular supplies are somewhat mundane, much of the ammo listed in today's announcement is hard to come by right now. Also the small arms ammunition is being provided under USAI, not drawdown authority, so it's a different bucket than money used for equipment pulled out of storage. But even though other countries can provide 155mm, for example, the Ukrainians are desperate for as much as they can get their hands on so the US is providing it from drawdown rather than relying on others to donate the ammo. And even if the Ukrainians were able to acquire that ammunition elsewhere, there's no guarantee that it would be deliverable within a time frame that works for their requirements.\n\nOtherwise, the US aid is driven largely by the priorities set by Ukraine. Obviously those priorities are set in consultation with US advisors, but the relevant point for this discussion is that there is a priority list, and it exists to manage capacity limits both in terms of what the US can supply and in terms of how quickly the Ukrainians can absorb new equipment, capabilities, or supplies and translate them into specific battlefield results. Entirely new systems are harder to introduce, especially if they require an accompanying supply chain of spare parts and ammunition as M110s would.  \n\n[You can infer a bit about Ukraine's current priorities from today's list](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3350958/biden-administration-announces-additional-security-assistance-for-ukraine/). Some items are not very revealing, like there's a few of the standard items that show up in most tranches of donations like a generic commitment to fund training and sustainment, extra SATCOM gear and other secure comms equipment, etc.. But the rest of the package is almost exclusively counter-UAS/anti-air systems, engineering and support equipment for breaching assaults, and ammunition.\n\nSo much ammunition. Clearly artillery ammo is a concern, as has been widely reported in the news, because there's a ton included in this package. So we can infer that there is a powerful need for more ammo, but not as much for new artillery systems in general. Presumably because ammo for the guns they already have is more useful than entirely new SPGs that would then be as equally ammo-starved as the previously supplied systems, while reducing the available logistics pipeline for supplying ammo to the existing systems by introducing requirements for new parts and ammo.\n\nBut the engineering and support equipment is the most telling. It's mostly kit you need to breach well-defended fortifications over mine fields and other obstacles. \n\nFrom Presidential Drawdown:\n\n> - 11 tactical vehicles to recover equipment;\n> - 61 heavy fuel tankers;\n> - 10 trucks and 10 trailers to transport heavy equipment;\n> - Testing and diagnostic equipment to support vehicle maintenance and repair;\n> - Spare parts and other field equipment.\n\nFrom USAI:\n\n> - Seven tactical vehicles to recover equipment;\n> - Eight heavy fuel tankers and 105 fuel trailers;\n> - Armored bridging systems;\n> - Four logistics support vehicles;\n> - Trucks and ten trailers to transport heavy equipment;\n\nThis is a large chunk of the support equipment a division would need for an armored offensive. The armored bridge laying vehicles are necessary for an armored assault on fortifications with tank traps (trenches too wide for a tank to drive across but deep enough for one to get stuck in if they try).\n\nA large supply of fuel trucks are needed to keep the unit moving forward when on the offensive, because the farther they push away from their logistics base into enemy-held territory, the more trucks are required to maintain the same level of fuel supply because of travel time back to pipeline-supplied oil storage in the rear (the tyranny of the wagon equation). It's likely fuel issues slowed down the Kharkiv offensive and contributed to the Ukrainians not being able to push past Lyman to establish lines along the Oskil river in the first few days of the offensive. And that offensive intentionally relied primarily on some of the fastest and least gas hungry of Ukraine's equipment like IMVs and more lightly armored APCs or wheeled AFVS rather than tracked IFVs or MBTs. So you can see why it would be a concern if they are planning heavy breaching assaults that will require comparatively more gas-guzzling IFVs and tanks.\n\nThe ability to quickly recover damaged equipment, and then to get it repaired and back in action is critical for maintaining momentum in an offensive. Otherwise attrition from minor damage can bog the attacking unit down even when they face relatively ineffective enemy resistance. The diagnostics equipment is interesting from that perspective, and relative to an idea that [I proposed a few days ago and discussed again elsewhere in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/12bgw15/credibledefense_daily_megathread_april_04_2023/jezo762/), which is basically that the Ukrainians are finally adding a layer of command between brigade-level and the general staff with their three new offensive army corps. In western armies, divisions typically have their own maintenance units that are capable of making pretty significant field repairs to armored vehicles. But Ukraine has been forced to send vehicles with even minor problems away to Poland or even Germany for repairs that could have been conducted in the field by an appropriately trained and equipped divisional maintenance unit. Now that they are developing proper division-equivalent command structures, it makes sense that they are adding in the support units typical for that echelon, because it will greatly speed up their ability to get damaged vehicles back into the fight.\n\nSo basically all of this looks like it is highly targeted to enhance the upcoming spring offensive and so delivery is time sensitive. The 18 brigades apparently reserved for that purpose likely have enough artillery already, or will have enough shortly when additional committed donations arrive. For context, one of those 18 brigades was equipped with 22 British M109s. Which would mean 396 in total would be required to equip the entire army corps to the same level. In total, the Ukrainians have received or have received commitments for somewhere upwards of 450 western SPGs of varying types, of which likely around 300-400 have been delivered, while around 30-35 of those have subsequently been documented lost by Oryx. The UAF also had like 1000+ SPGs of their own at the start of the war, of which around 100 have been documented lost by Oryx. So they certainly have enough to round out the remaining offensive brigades, although it is hard to say if they can afford to do so without stripping the front of western SPGs or instead without complicating their logistics train by adding Soviet 152mm systems to the mix. But judging from the latest donations not including any extra SPGs, I would guess they have enough for now.",

We know that early on they were used heavily on strategic, fixed targets like supply depots, antonivskyi bridge, command and control centers, etc. However as these targets were hit or moved out of range, we have heard less about strikes. Clearly the Ukrainians continue to use ammunition as most aid packages have a line item for additional rockets. It seems with fewer high priority targets, HIMARS could be incredibly useful in tactical situations (ex. the recent Ukrainian assault on the \u2018T-Shape\u2019 trench published in the last week), but to my knowledge we haven\u2019t seen footage to that effect. I wonder if there are simply still enough higher priority strategic targets far behind the line to sustain current use, if there is a media blackout on tactical strike footage, launches are at night, or a combination of all of these factors.

They also say the boat may have been a decoy, put to sea to distract from the true perpetrators, who remain at large, according to officials with knowledge of an investigation led by Germany\u2019s attorney general. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to share details about the active inquiry, including doubts about the Andromeda\u2019s role that haven\u2019t been previously reported.\n\n> Officials hope that the true purpose of Andromeda in the deep-sea demolition will provide further insight in a high-stakes, international whodunnit that could eventually lead to those responsible and explain their motives, which remain unclear.\n\n> U.S. and European officials said they still don\u2019t know for sure who is behind the underwater attack. But several said they shared German skepticism that a crew of six people on one sailboat laid the hundreds of pounds of explosives that disabled Nord Stream 1 and part of Nord Stream 2, a newer set of pipelines that wasn\u2019t yet delivering gas to customers.\n\n> Experts noted that while it was theoretically possible to place the explosives on the pipeline by hand, even skilled divers would be challenged submerging more than 200 feet to the seabed and slowly rising to the surface to allow time for their bodies to decompress.\n\n> Such an operation would have taken multiple dives, exposing the Andromeda to detection from nearby ships. The mission would have been easier to hide and pull off using remotely piloted underwater vehicles or small submarines, said diving and salvage experts who have worked in the area of the explosion, which features rough seas and heavy shipping traffic.\n\n> The German investigation has determined that traces of \u201cmilitary-grade\u201d explosives found on a table inside the boat\u2019s cabin match the batch of explosives used on the pipeline. Several officials doubted that skilled saboteurs would leave such glaring evidence of their guilt behind. They wonder if the explosive traces \u2014 collected months after the rented boat was returned to its owners \u2014 were meant to falsely lead investigators to the Andromeda as the vessel used in the attack.\n\n> \u201cThe question is whether the story with the sailboat is something to distract or only part of the picture,\u201d said one person with knowledge of the investigation.\n\n> Still others allow that the bombers may simply have been sloppy.\n\n> \u201cIt doesn\u2019t all fit,\u201d a senior European security official said of the fragments of evidence. \u201cBut people can make mistakes.\u201d\n\n> *Suspicions turn to Poland and Ukraine*\n\n> The German investigation has linked the yacht rental to a Polish company, which is in turn owned by a European company that\u2019s connected to a prominent Ukrainian, fueling speculation from Berlin to Warsaw to Kyiv that a deep-pocketed partisan may have financed the operation. The identity of the Polish company and the Ukrainian individual, as well as his potential motive, remains unclear.\n\n> Based on the initial German findings, officials have been whispering about the potential involvement of the Polish or Ukrainian government in the attack. Poland arguably had a motive, some said, considering it has been among the most vocal critics of the Nord Stream project since it began in the late 1990s, warning that the pipelines, running from western Russia to Germany, would make Europe dependent on the Kremlin for energy.\n\n> Marcin Przydacz, the Polish president\u2019s chief foreign policy adviser, urged caution about reaching conclusions from the initial evidence. He too shared the view that the Andromeda could be a red herring, but said it may have been planted by Moscow.\n\n> \u201cThis could be a Russian game to blame\u201d Poland, Przydacz said in an interview at the presidential palace in Warsaw. \u201cPoland had nothing to do with this [attack].\u201d\n\n> Intelligence agencies have found no clear evidence that Russia, initially the prime suspect, was responsible.\n\n> Privately, former Polish government officials said that despite the country\u2019s vehement opposition to Nord Stream and staunch support for arming Ukraine, they doubted that President Andrzej Duda would authorize an act that risked fracturing the alliance of nations that have come to Ukraine\u2019s defense. Polish officials routinely refer to Ukraine\u2019s conflict with Russia as \u201cour war\u201d and are fearful that if Russian President Vladimir Putin succeeds there, he would set his sights on Poland next.\n\n> Suspicion also has turned toward Ukraine as the culprit behind the Nord Stream bombings, based in part on intercepted communications of pro-Ukraine individuals discussing the possibility of carrying out an attack on the pipelines before the explosions, The Washington Post previously reported.\n\n> A senior Western security official with knowledge of the secretly gathered intelligence said the communications were only discovered after the bombing, when Western spy agencies began searching their records for insights.\n\n> \u201cUkraine absolutely did not participate in the attack on Nord Stream,\u201d Mykhailo Podolyak, a top adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky, said last month, questioning why his country would conduct an operation that \u201cdestabilizes the region and will divert attention from the war, which is categorically not beneficial to us.\u201d\n\n> Those who suspect Ukrainian involvement said that disabling the pipeline could have been an effort to galvanize allied support in the face of Russian aggression, and particularly to strengthen German resolve. Germany had halted activated authorization for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline days before Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\n> Officials in the United States and Europe initially blamed Russia for the bombing. The country had already halted gas flows on Nord Stream 1, the older of the two sets of pipelines. That suggested that Moscow was willing to engage in a form of political blackmail with energy supplies.\n\n> One of the pair of Nord Stream 2 pipes remains intact. Both of the Nord Stream 1 lines were severed in the explosions on Sept. 26.\n\n> Some officials said that Ukrainian saboteurs or those from other countries acting in what they felt were Ukraine\u2019s best interest could have attacked Nord Stream without Zelensky\u2019s knowledge, arguing that he doesn\u2019t have complete visibility into all the operations of his government or the military. That kind of plausible deniability could protect the celebrated leader and dampen the political fallout of a brazen attack tied to his country, these officials said.\n\n> No country has provided firm evidence tying the attacks to Ukraine, and a senior Biden administration official has cautioned that the intercepted communications of pro-Ukrainian actors are not conclusive.\n\n> German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius warned against making early conclusions as to who was responsible, suggesting that it might be a \u201cfalse flag\u201d operation, an idea echoed by other German politicians.\n\n> Roderich Kiesewetter, a German lawmaker who is part of a committee that was briefed last month by intelligence officials on the probe\u2019s progress, said he believes that investigators have not yet communicated any results because the \u201cevidence is far too thin.\u201d\n\n> Kiesewetter said that unfounded speculation over the culprits could endanger cohesion in Europe. \u201cWe should continue to ask who had an interest in the detonation\u201d and who \u201cbenefits from uncertainty and accusations,\u201d he said.",

            "body": "[2/2]\n\n> *Trail of breadcrumbs*\n\n> As the Nord Stream mystery has turned into an international game of Clue, German investigators have scoured the Andromeda for leads. Officials first became interested in the vessel after the country\u2019s domestic intelligence agency received a \u201cvery concrete tip\u201d from a Western intelligence service that the boat may have been involved in the sabotage, according to a German security official, who declined to name the country that shared the information.\n\n> German authorities determined that the tip was credible and passed the information onto law enforcement officials, the official said.\n\n> The Andromeda left a virtual trail of breadcrumbs as it set off from a German port for the Baltic Sea, according to investigators.\n\n> Mola Yachting rented out the boat on Sept. 6 from Hohe D\u00fcne harbor in Warnem\u00fcnde, a German port town on the Baltic, near Rostock, which is about 145 miles north of Berlin. The rental location is in plain sight of a huge vacation complex, home to a five-star hotel, seven restaurants and a high-end shopping area, with views across the harbor.\n\n> Investigators said the boat then traveled in a northeasterly direction, stopping in Hafendorf Wiek, or \u201cWiek harbor village,\u201d on the northernmost part of R\u00fcgen island.\n\n> When a reporter from The Post visited in early March, the area had emptied out, save for the odd local dog-walker braving the biting temperatures. A half-dozen yachts bobbed in the water where the Andromeda is said to have been. \u201cInvestigators came [in] mid-January, and we helped them where we could,\u201d said the harbor master, Ren\u00e9 Redmann.\n\n> \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be unusual for a boat setting off from Rostock with the destination of Bornholm to stop in Wiek,\u201d Redmann noted, referring to a Danish island near the site of the Nord Stream explosion.

Officials first became interested in the vessel after the country\u2019s domestic intelligence agency received a \u201cvery concrete tip\u201d from a Western intelligence service that the boat may have been involved in the sabotage, according to a German security official, who declined to name the country that shared the information.</p>\n\n<p>German authorities determined that the tip was credible and passed the information onto law enforcement officials, the official said.</p>\n\n<p>The Andromeda left a virtual trail of breadcrumbs as it set off from a German port for the Baltic Sea, according to investigators.</p>\n\n<p>Mola Yachting rented out the boat on Sept. 6 from Hohe D\u00fcne harbor in Warnem\u00fcnde, a German port town on the Baltic, near Rostock, which is about 145 miles north of Berlin. The rental location is in plain sight of a huge vacation complex, home to a five-star hotel, seven restaurants and a high-end shopping area, with views across the harbor.</p>\n\n<p>Investigators said the boat then traveled in a northeasterly direction, stopping in Hafendorf Wiek, or \u201cWiek harbor village,\u201d on the northernmost part of R\u00fcgen island.</p>\n\n<p>When a reporter from The Post visited in early March, the area had emptied out, save for the odd local dog-walker braving the biting temperatures. A half-dozen yachts bobbed in the water where the Andromeda is said to have been. \u201cInvestigators came [in] mid-January, and we helped them where we could,\u201d said the harbor master, Ren\u00e9 Redmann.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be unusual for a boat setting off from Rostock with the destination of Bornholm to stop in Wiek,\u201d Redmann noted, referring to a Danish island near the site of the Nord Stream explosion. Investigators believe that the Andromeda left Hafendorf Wiek and moored off the coast of the tiny island Christianso, near Bornholm.</p>\n\n<p>A stop in Hafendork Wiek may have offered the Andromeda\u2019s crew a final chance to stock up on supplies before heading to the explosion site.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cLots of things are loaded on the boats \u2026 including groceries,\u201d Redmann said. \u201cSome people stop to tank up on fuel.\u201d Redmann would not confirm that the Andromeda stopped there, citing the continuing law enforcement investigation.

        "body": "As we enter the end of the rasputitsa and the beginning of the campaigning season in Ukraine (mid-April to mid-May is the unofficial start), I've been thinking about how the potential Ukrainian offensive might play out. In so doing, I've been reading accounts of similar campaigns in the same area during the Second World War. Specifically, I am drawn to accounts of the Eastern Front from late 1942 to the end of the war in 1945. History never repeats, but you can listen for the rhymes.\n\nThe German strategy until Uranus in Stalingrad is much like Russia's current strategy in Bakhmut and other Ukrainian cities in the Donbass: a long, slogging attritional campaign to clear urban sectors, block by block--hampered by the fact that logistically and militarily, the attacker cannot perform any encirclements or overwhelm defenses with firepower and manpower. Let me be extremely frank: this is a dumb way to do war, as the Soviets demonstrated in 1944-45, when they, instead of committing to endless sieges, just encircled whole army units, seizing so much land so quickly that Germany could barely react other than a paltry ramshod defense. The Berlin campaign is the perfect example: the Germans had thrown hundreds of thousands of soldiers to stop the Soviet advance in March 1945. The Soviets smashed through them, bypassed them, encircled Berlin (which by then only had 100,000 units), encircled other units including ones sent to relieve Berlin (12th and 9th armies were pinned and encircled), and in a matter of days, captured the city and ended the war. The Allied Ruhr campaign is also textbook.\n\nTurning back to 1942, what ended Stalingrad was the attack on the weak Romanian and Italian-led flanks, which led to an unhinging of German units that Germany never really recovered from.\n\nHow this relates to the modern war: the key question to ask is, can the Romanian and Italian fronts hold this time; can the units that Putin has assembled and mobilized to hold the front at the flanks actually hold their positions against a Ukrainian assault? It is impossible to know for sure--had anyone known how Uranus or other Soviet military campaigns would've played out, they'd be prophets. But I think the modern units Ukraine has assembled, with their modern tactics, training, and equipment are more than a match for the non-VDV and non-Wagner units at the front, assigned to man the trenches.\n\nIf the attack succeeds, we will see a change in the tempo of the war. Ukraine will have to mobilize far more men and material to actually achieve final victory, but a success in the offensive is the key condition to securing further Western supplies. This might be wishful thinking, but I think we will see an end to the phase of the war of attritional city battles. In the best case, Ukraine will be able to conduct deep operations, as in, be able to penetrate deep through the front lines and encircle whole Russian units, while forward units continue to penetrate and disrupt the rear. But even in a mid case, Ukraine should be able to maneuver around strongpoints, neutralize defenses, and secure capitulations--sieges will be short as cut-off Russian units totally demoralize. The speed of these victories will be hampered only by stubborn Russian units and logistical difficulties.\n\nI think there's little point in comparing Hitler and Putin individually or psychologically. Same with the Russian state. There are similarities but mostly differences. Insofar as military strategies though, one can't help but notice that Barbarossa was as ill-concieved and ill-planned as the 2022 invasion. That, unable to achieve quick victory, Putin like Hitler is resorting to grinding affairs to capture towns and cities. That his flanks are not held by the elite but by in effect, poorly-trained, poorly-equipped conscripts. That, while he squanders his offensive potential away in Bakhmut, Ukraine is massing highly-equipped, highly-trained forces and pointing them at those weak flanks.\n\nBut nothing is determined yet, of course. Had the Romanians held fast (somehow, don't ask me how!) and Uranus failed, Stalingrad likely would've fallen by the end of December 1942. Of course, that would've been no major victory for Hitler. His forces would have equally hard sieges ahead of them--at Baku, Moscow, and the continued struggle at Leningrad. We could say the same about Putin. If he wins in the upcoming battles, he'll not have the won the war. He still has dozens of towns in the Donbass to clear, each of them potentially as difficult to storm as Bakhmut. The risk here is that if Ukraine fails, Western supplies might dry up. But given all we know--I think it is safe to say that today's modern Romanians and Italians (the weak Russian conscript forces) will fare as good as their 1942 counterparts. And if that is the case, and assuming Putin doesn't choose the nuclear option, a true Ukrainian victory is not impossible to foresee.",

A drive to the coastline that is properly reinforced would render much of the southern front untenable, then open the way for Crimea to be tackled. And I doubly agree that taking Crimea by assault is a bad idea, unless Russian armed forces totally collapse and Russia doesn't play the N-card.\n\n\nMy borderline non-credible suggestion is that Ukraine instead assaults over the Dniepr and pushes eastwards in order to outflank Russian lines and defenses oriented north. The rumored Ukrainian recon-in-force on the left-bank of the Dneipr after Kherson first fell could have been a trial run into an amphibious assault. \n\n\nOf course, this is basically non-credible, because it's Ukraine opting into a repeat of Kherson, except they're now the side constrained by geography while also attacking.

And I doubly agree that taking Crimea by assault is a bad idea, unless Russian armed forces totally collapse and Russia doesn&#39;t play the N-card.</p>\n\n<p>My borderline non-credible suggestion is that Ukraine instead assaults over the Dniepr and pushes eastwards in order to outflank Russian lines and defenses oriented north. The rumored Ukrainian recon-in-force on the left-bank of the Dneipr after Kherson first fell could have been a trial run into an amphibious assault. </p>\n\n<p>Of course, this is basically non-credible, because it&#39;s Ukraine opting into a repeat of Kherson, except they&#39;re now the side constrained by geography while also attacking. But I bring it up as an alternative to the expected offensives in the east.</p>\n</div>",

Meanwhile, there is much more immediate strategic incentive to align with the Democrats on China.\n\nEdit: Furthermore, China is **the** symbol of offshored manufacturing in the 21st century. Republicans have been coming back around to Perot's positions since Trump's 2015 campaign and deindustrialization has cause significant shifts to the Republicans among voters in the Great Lakes area. Russia, on the other hand, doesn't compete with the US economically aside from fossil fuel exports (which is a very crowded market already) and its military has now been revealed to have been far less capable than previously thought.

I return with tables to show just how drastic the change has been from 2021-2023. All populations are in millions. \n\nAge | 2021 Males | 2023 Males | % Change | 2021 Females | 2023 Females | % Change\n:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:\n15-19 | 1.05 | 0.87 | -17% | 0.99 | 0.78 | -21%\n20-24 | 1.05 | 0.48 | -54% | 0.99 | 0.38 | -62%\n25-29 | 1.36 | 0.68 | -50% | 1.29 | 0.60 | -53%\n30-34 | 1.76 | 1.17 | -34% | 1.70 | 1.11 | -35%\n35-39 | 1.88 | 1.61 | -14% | 1.86 | 1.59 | -15%\n40-44 | 1.63 | 1.50 | -8% | 1.67 | 1.55 | -7%\n\nKeep in mind it's even worse than this in effect since there are more Ukrainians under Russian control than before. \n\nIt's interesting how closely the male and female population estimates match, suggesting that efforts to prevent male exodus was unsuccessful. It further suggests that much of the exodus of those in their early 20s isn't driven by draft dodging, since most have yet to form families or stable relationships. \n\nThere's a major caveat due to the difficulty in making these estimates in a war-torn country that hasn't performed a census in decades. Another is that 2021 cohorts are not the same as the 2023 ones so some change would be expected due to prior population unevenness (e.g. if there are fewer 18 and 19 year olds than 23 and 24 year olds in 2021, it could give the impression that there is an exodus of 20-24 year olds when it's just the 23 and 24 year olds aging out of the bracket; a better analysis would be performed by birth year rather than age).

I think the best data out there shows that China would likely fail in it's attempts to invade Taiwan but the cost on all sides would be immense. It would be the worst kind of war where major powers get into a slugfest with each other and both sides would have deep reserves of manpower, hardware and manufacturing to keep the war going for years without either side having an overwhelming advantage enough to decisively defeat the other side and force surrender. That being said there are some good reasons for thinking that IF a war is going to happen that 2025-2027 is the window of time it might happen for a few reasons. \n\n1. China has build a brand new shiny military, everything looks great now but soon it won't be new and shiny and China will begin to spend more and more of it's budget on refurbishing, maintaining and supporting it's military. The peak of when China will be spending a lot more time maintaining legacy platforms vs making new shiny stuff will be around 2026-2027. Every year after that will slow down the production of new stuff and make them less of a threat unless they want to sink an ever growing portion of their GDP into the military. \n\n2. Everyone is re-arming in the region to prepare for a war. Taiwan, Japan, Australia, the US etc are all adding new capabilities that are designed to specifically counter china but many of them will not be available in force till closer to 2030. The US has the B-21 raider and the NGAD 6th gen fighter, AUSUK nuclear sub deal with Australia, Taiwan is slowly changing their military to adjust to not have a technological edge over China, Japan is building out a new and shiny blue water navy and making their own 6th gen jet with the UK and Italy. A war in 2035 will see enemies with a lot more capability then a war in 2025. \n\n3. Demographics are not on Chinas side over time. Their demographics are declining sharply and a ton of manufacturing is leaving China because of the cost of labor and other issues and going to places like Indonesia, Mexico etc. China's economy looks like it is sliding into the middle income trap and in 2035 it is possible they will be weaker economically then they are today. \n\n4. As others have mentioned the US has elections and this makes election cycles matter for the timing of an attack. An attack near election day would be very chaotic.",

The neocons who ran the Bush administration's foreign policy said explicitly that their goal was to secure American primacy for another century.\n\nThe phrase, \"Axis of Evil,\" used by the Bush administration, gives a sense for how ambitious US foreign policy was. Iraq was supposed to be only the first of a series of wars, which would reshape the Middle East (and perhaps even other regions), leaving behind friendly governments and US bases. Iraq turned into a quagmire, which is why there weren't subsequent invasions of Iran, Syria, etc.\n\nBack then, the US was acting as the only major power around. There was no other power that could militarily check the US. China wasn't yet really on Americans' radars as a near-peer rival.\n\nNow, the fundamental danger facing the world is that there is a rising power, which we have every reason to expect will soon have an economy that is much larger than that of the US. It's difficult to imagine the US retaining its unrivaled status at the top when another country with significantly more economic weight exists.\n\nThere will eventually have to be an accommodation between the US and China. If there's no war, the US will be eclipsed and will eventually have to find a way to coexist as the #2 power in the system. The US will still be a major power, but it will not be in the exceptional position it found itself in during the Clinton and W. Bush years, when it could act as it wanted almost anywhere in the world. However, it's difficult to imagine the US simply accepting this #2 status, and fear of and hostility towards China are now skyrocketing in the US.\n\nThis brings up the second possibility: that there will be a war between the US and China. This would be catastrophic for everyone. Even if there were no nuclear escalation, the world economy would be wrecked. I would like to believe that everyone wants to avoid this possibility, but the problem is that there's a powerful incentive on the part of US to seek a conflict, sooner rather than later. It would be the final cast of the die, in the hopes of maintaining a dominant position. I think the Chinese government very strongly desires to avoid a military conflict, because the feeling (backed by a rational calculation) in China is that time favors China, as the rising power that is catching up economically.\n\nHowever, there is one Achilles' heel that Chinese leaders will feel compelled to fight over: Taiwan. The idea of giving up Chinese sovereign territory (you don't have to agree that it should be Chinese territory, but the Chinese very strongly feel that it is, because it was a part of China before the civil war split the country) is completely unacceptable to most people in China. The issue of Taiwanese independence is quickly becoming a litmus test in the US that every politician has to pass in order to prove their anti-China credentials. I don't think most Americans understand that they're playing with fire here, and this issue is the spark that very well may lead to war. As anti-Chinese sentiment continues to ramp up in the US, driven by the fear of being eclipsed as the world's preeminent power, the danger of war increases.",

The US has promised to adopt a &quot;One China&quot; policy, and not to turn that policy into a &quot;One China, One Taiwan&quot; policy.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>PRC the only one that might start a war.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>By breaking the status quo over Taiwan, the US is very likely to provoke a war. I&#39;m sure it will try to blame the war on China, but the US government knows exactly what the consequences of breaching the policy are. By abandoning the One China policy, the US is presenting China with two options:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Face utter humiliation, by ceding Chinese territory under outside pressure.</p></li>\n<li><p>Go to war to preserve Chinese sovereignty.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>You never want to force that choice on a major power. Doing so is tantamount to a declaration of war.</p>\n</div>",
