Moscow announced those cuts unilaterally in February following the introduction of Western price caps.\n\n>After Russia's unilateral reductions, U.S. officials said its alliance with other OPEC members was weakening, but Sunday's move shows the cooperation is still strong.\n\n>The Saudi energy ministry said in a statement that the kingdom's voluntary cut was a precautionary measure aimed at supporting the stability of the oil market.\n\n>Oil prices fell to 15-month lows earlier this month in response to the banking crisis that followed the collapse of two U.S. lenders and resulted in Credit Suisse being rescued by Switzerland's biggest bank UBS.\n\n>\"OPEC is taking pre-emptive steps in case of any possible demand reduction,\" Amrita Sen, founder and director of Energy Aspects, said on Sunday.\n\nSeems like the US/West's relationship with OPEC+ continues to sour.

        "body": "Following from activity seen immediatly before the war and sporadically ever since, Russian vessels have been spotted just off the Irish coast. Coincidentally around the areas where the bulk of transatlantic undersea cables pass through to Ireland. Naturally, given Ireland's limited military infrastructure , there isn't much the country can do to thwart off the Russian ships or to investigate the cables themselves to show signs of tampering. \n\nNot only is Ireland extremely dependent on the cables for our tech sector but much of Europe/North America is as well. I'm extremely frustrated how naive and passive our government (along with much of the population) is towards this threat, hiding behind the 'we're neutral so we're not militarised' to excuse the inability to protect our sovereignty. \n\nI will say that rhetoric about how untenable it is to maintain this status quo is growing.
