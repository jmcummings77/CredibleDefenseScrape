Elsewhere, they are likely to continue harassing fires. Make no mistake, wherever high intensity fighting occurs is likely to see very high fire rate. Prior to 24th Feb, reports out of Ukraine indicated that howitzers were firing at 300-400 rounds/tube/day. That's doubled the 1973 Yom-Kippur war's rate and quadrupled compared to US WW2's rate; it's a lot more once you consider that in WWII, the US was firing mostly 105mm rounds instead of 155mm. At that rate, a barrel lasts 5 days. \n\nAll of these \"rotating\" solution will have issues of their own. First of all, it costs fuel to drag these pieces around. Second, there are certain to have combat everywhere. Third, rotating units laterally is disorganized. \n\nA better solution will be to slow down the rate of replacement and reinforcements to batteries in quieter sectors and concentrate those to the more threatened sectors. By that, I mean, inevitably as a result of casualties or wear, a howitzer battery is not at 100% strength. A battery at 100% strength may have, 4-6 guns. Let's say 4.

Modern versions doing better at 200 hr plus. So they have designed the aircraft to require minimal maintenance for these 160 hrs, with then a requirement for a complete overhaul/rebuild. The thinking being in war few survivors would be overhauled.*\n\n*Thus the Russian airforce VKS running 200 sorties per day is creating an issue of too many air frames using up their minimal maintenance hours and requiring a complete overhaul (long period of downtime). This is creating a demand on available airframes, and also shortcuts in the overhaul producing a higher accident rate.*\n\n*Can I get a second opinion on the above? I haven't heard about the 160hrs minimal maintenance usage then complete overhaul requirement before.*\n\nI did some digging and apparently the Saturn AL-31 engines for the SU-XX family had an original MTB Overhaul of ~100 hrs initially, then improved to 300 hrs to match original requirements, then 500/700hrs and finally supposedly 1000hrs MTBO or TBO for the latest and greatest.\n\nIt seems most common is the 300 to 700hr tbo model for older airframes, as they stockpiled engines. With the expectation of 300 tbo models now used up.\n\nThe RD-33 of MIG-29 had originally 300hrs TBO with India doing 200hr TBO, but modern versions now hit 700 hrs. The RD-33 apparently had/has a problem with dirt intakes and afterburner wear greatly reducing TBO time. So using them on improvised runways isn't advised.\n\nIt does seem Russian maintenance thinking is very basic checks that can be performed by limited maintenance personnel up to the TBO time where it goes to a depot.\n\nFor the west, the Engine for the F16D, GE F110 had a 1000hr TBO but requires a very detailed inspection every ~200 to 400hr depending on the version. Thus a heavier maintenance load in field, but longer gaps between complete overhaul and it seems a near doubling of service life. I honestly can't find much solid figures on western tbo, especially latest versions which I suspect are higher.\n\nSo 160hrs isn't accurate, but the TBO for Russian aircraft is much lower on average than the west and same with service life. It really depends on what engine versions Russia is using, which is probably fair to assume not the top of line export version. The increase in sorties would mean a much higher number of overhauls now being required putting pressure on the depot maintenance.\n\nIf they took shortcuts with older engines for their limited number of newer airframes it would mean that because of heavier use in Syria and now Ukraine there would be alot needing overhaul.\n\nThe MIG-29 especially the older models had pretty poor engines, so anyone donating used ones to Ukraine without a supply of newer engines aren't dramatically increasing capability.",

                "body": "> During the first week of the invasion, Russian electronic warfare using jamming equipment and\nE-96M aerial decoys were highly effective in disrupting Ukrainian GBAD. 12 S-300 and SA-11 \u2018Buk\u2019\nradar-guided surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems were particularly badly affected in the north of\nthe country, especially to the north of Kyiv along the Hostomel/Irpin and Chernihiv axes. 13 Cruise\nand ballistic missile strikes had also damaged or destroyed multiple long-range early warning\nradars throughout the country, and destroyed various Ukrainian SAM sites in Kherson and\nZaporizhzhia oblasts in the south. The physical destruction, along with the electronic disruption\nand suppression of SAM systems in the north and northeast, left the Mikoyan Mig-29 and Sukhoi\nSu-27 fighters of the Ukrainian Air Force with the task of providing air defence over most of the\ncountry for the first few days of the war. 14 The Ukrainian air defences progressively recovered\nas jammed and damaged radar systems were reset and assets were rapidly repositioned during\nthe second and third days. After that, the Air Force and air defence infrastructures worked\nin tandem. Deconfliction between aircraft and GBAD was coordinated by time until 3 March,\nafter which deconfliction began to be coordinated by space because of friendly fire incidents. 15\nIn other words, SAM systems and combat aircraft sorties began to be deconflicted by being\nallocated separate operational areas.\n\n> While Ukrainian GBAD units were electronically degraded and trying to reorganise and recover\nfrom physical strikes, Russian GBAD units inside Ukraine were also suffering from major\nlimitations. Mobile air-defence assets, such as the short-range SA-15 \u2018Tor\u2019 and medium-range\nSA-17 \u2018Buk\u2019, had been sent into Ukraine with no functional communications plan. They were also\nadvancing out of sequence and often separated from the formations that they were supposed\nto protect; and they were operating under very restrictive rules of engagement which instructed\nthem to assume anything flying was Russian. 16 The inability of radar-guided SAMs on either side\nto perform as anticipated during the first week and a half meant that fixed-wing aircraft on both\nsides had remarkable freedom to penetrate significant distances across the rapidly changing\nfrontlines. This would quickly cease to be the case from early March, when both sides\u2019 GBAD\nreorganised and became far more effective.\n\n...\n\n> Russian ground forces being unable to effectively communicate now became a greater threat\nto the Russian operation than Ukrainian SAM systems, so their electronic warfare assets began\nto greatly scale back their operations after the first two days. This allowed newly relocated\nUkrainian SAM systems to regain much of their effectiveness, although it took time to repair\nor adapt to much of the damage to key radar systems for early warning and long-range missile\nguidance. In the first week of March, however, Ukrainian SAMs began to inflict significant losses\non Russian attack sorties.45\n\n...\n\n> This allowed far better coordination of Russian aircraft, long-range strike capabilities, electronic\nwarfare assets and GBAD with ground operations. Alongside continued heavy use of Kh-31P\nand Kh-58 ARMs by VKS fighters, Russian troops also began to effectively coordinate operations\nwith hunting complexes of Orlan-10 UAVs to force Ukrainian SAM systems to unmask and then\nsuppress them for long enough using electronic warfare attack to designate individual SAMs for\naccurate artillery and missile strikes. 62 This rapidly forced medium-range Ukrainian Air Force\nSA-11 \u2018Buk\u2019 and short-range Ukrainian Army SA-8 \u2018Osa\u2019 SAM systems to operate further back from\nthe frontlines to reduce loss rates, and allowed Russian aircraft a significant degree of freedom\nto operate at medium and high altitudes in the vicinity of the frontlines. \n\nThere has been multiple credible reports made from the initial data available on Russia EW during this conflict, and that is not a accurate assessment that you made. \n\nhttps://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/russian-total-war-ukraine-challenges-and-opportunities\n\nThis includes articles submitted to this very subreddit:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/wtfq94/the_fall_and_rise_of_russian_electronic_warfare/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/w04ajz/russias_path_to_the_high_tech_battlespace/",

Mobile air-defence assets, such as the short-range SA-15 \u2018Tor\u2019 and medium-range\nSA-17 \u2018Buk\u2019, had been sent into Ukraine with no functional communications plan. They were also\nadvancing out of sequence and often separated from the formations that they were supposed\nto protect; and they were operating under very restrictive rules of engagement which instructed\nthem to assume anything flying was Russian. 16 The inability of radar-guided SAMs on either side\nto perform as anticipated during the first week and a half meant that fixed-wing aircraft on both\nsides had remarkable freedom to penetrate significant distances across the rapidly changing\nfrontlines. This would quickly cease to be the case from early March, when both sides\u2019 GBAD\nreorganised and became far more effective.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Russian ground forces being unable to effectively communicate now became a greater threat\nto the Russian operation than Ukrainian SAM systems, so their electronic warfare assets began\nto greatly scale back their operations after the first two days. This allowed newly relocated\nUkrainian SAM systems to regain much of their effectiveness, although it took time to repair\nor adapt to much of the damage to key radar systems for early warning and long-range missile\nguidance. In the first week of March, however, Ukrainian SAMs began to inflict significant losses\non Russian attack sorties.45</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This allowed far better coordination of Russian aircraft, long-range strike capabilities, electronic\nwarfare assets and GBAD with ground operations. Alongside continued heavy use of Kh-31P\nand Kh-58 ARMs by VKS fighters, Russian troops also began to effectively coordinate operations\nwith hunting complexes of Orlan-10 UAVs to force Ukrainian SAM systems to unmask and then\nsuppress them for long enough using electronic warfare attack to designate individual SAMs for\naccurate artillery and missile strikes. 62 This rapidly forced medium-range Ukrainian Air Force\nSA-11 \u2018Buk\u2019 and short-range Ukrainian Army SA-8 \u2018Osa\u2019 SAM systems to operate further back from\nthe frontlines to reduce loss rates, and allowed Russian aircraft a significant degree of freedom\nto operate at medium and high altitudes in the vicinity of the frontlines. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There has been multiple credible reports made from the initial data available on Russia EW during this conflict, and that is not a accurate assessment that you made. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/russian-total-war-ukraine-challenges-and-opportunities\">https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/russian-total-war-ukraine-challenges-and-opportunities</a></p>\n\n<p>This includes articles submitted to this very subreddit:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/wtfq94/the_fall_and_rise_of_russian_electronic_warfare/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/wtfq94/the_fall_and_rise_of_russian_electronic_warfare/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/w04ajz/russias_path_to_the_high_tech_battlespace/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/w04ajz/russias_path_to_the_high_tech_battlespace/</a></p>\n</div>",

That radar is at least damaged.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/imp_navigator/status/1591011078661865472?s=20&amp;t=IYaPXlEMFs1Ale_G_li2lw\">IMR-2 heavy engineering vehicle</a> - the <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/Ix7rgUR\">moment of impact</a>. Again it doesn&#39;t look like a clear miss. The vehicle is almost certainly damaged.</p>\n\n<p>This <a href=\"https://twitter.com/imp_navigator/status/1592819756624928768?s=20&amp;t=SKLeAFe4j2SXC9kos_6ucQ\">BM-21 Grad miss</a> does not look like a miss at all.</p>\n</div>",
