      "selftext": "The r/CredibleDefense daily megathread is for asking questions and posting submissions that would not fit the criteria of our post submissions. As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster. Don't abuse it though! If something is not obviously against the rules but you still feel that it should be reviewed, leave a short but descriptive comment while filing the report.",

But I've only reported one of his posts, which I thought was not just copy-pasted propaganda, which I'd just downvote away no matter which side it's from, but copy-pasted propaganda that was deliberately inflamatory. The inflamatory character of propaganda texts from the cause one sympathizes with is easy to miss -- that's one reason why I never share things I read on Ukrainian channels on a short notice, I just don't trust myself to separate the interesting facts from the snide remarks. But in that case it was so obvious I doubted it was a mishap, and figured there was a high enough chance it was deliberate trolling that it warranted the moderators' attention.\n\nI think greater lenience towards *everyone*'s biases would make all discussions a lot more pleasant. For instance, I routinely disagree with Glideer's choice of quotes from articles he links to -- he leaves out important nuances, and oftentimes even important facts. Even when it doesn't change the point of the article entirely, it makes the small snippets and/or his summary sound a lot more inflammatory and definitive than the source he links to.\n\nBut 1. *we do have a rule* that says \"read the articles before you comment\" and 2. more importantly, lots of people who link to sources that have good things to say about Ukraine or the UAF get those wrong all the time, too. It's not at all easy to discern between deliberate narrative pushing and poor source selection.\n\nEdit: more importantly, at the risk of being smug, /r/credibledefense is not a very gullible community. Even if I'm being way too charitable here, and his posts really are 90% Russian propaganda and 10% interesting facts, I think that 10% is absolutely worth it. Russian propaganda is everywhere around us, and we make our way around it every day; we'd be subjected to it with or without Glideer posting it. It's likely that we wouldn't be getting that 10% without him though, or at least not as quickly. I mean, I follow some Russian Telegram channels but definitely not closely enough to be able to tell what's relevant and what isn't as easily as him.",

Giving Poland gravity bombs is not a necessary deterrent. Poland is under the NATO umbrella, a NATO umbrella that has arguably not been stronger since the height of the Cold War. Poland is mustering an impressive conventional force on top of this. So what exactly does having a US nuke bring Poland that they don't already have? It's not as if Poland can use them unilaterally. Even in the event of an invasion of Poland (a seemingly laughable idea at this moment, considering Russia cannot even handle Ukraine and Poland is a far more competent military), Poland does not have authorization to start slinging nukes, even if it is in its interests to do so. Is it a matter of range then? No not really, because there are already nukes in Germany. Moving them 350 miles to the east is, in nuclear war terms, of minimal value. If the nukes are not providing any additional deterrent and not providing any significant benefit in an actual usage strategy, then what exactly is the point of Poland having them?\n\nIn response to your specific points:\n\n1. Russia can demand whatever they want. They can't do anything about it and they know it.\n2. Putting nuclear forces on \"increased combat readiness\" doesn't mean anything. It was a propaganda stunt meant to scare the West. It did not work. Neither has the invasion of Ukraine.\n3. Western assistance has not be meaningfully deterred and Russia is struggling mightily in the war. The fact that NATO has responded strongly should bolster Poland's belief in the alliance. Russia's inability to win should also bolster Poland's belief in its conventional deterrent.\n4. The Baltic States are not getting a nuclear weapon. And Poland has enough conventional forces to prevent exactly what you're talking about in the short-term (hell probably even in the long-term) and a couple of gravity bombs they can't use without US authorization isn't going to change any of the bad stuff from happening anyway.\n5. This is unfortunate but doesn't justify giving them a nuclear bomb.\n6. Are we talking about Karaganov and Trenin when we say \"top tier Russian strategists\"? Because they're both loonies and their articles got major pushback in the Russian \"strategy\" circle. There is no reason to believe their words are policy or are worth basing policy off of.\n7. Nukes are (supposedly) being placed in Belarus. This does not really change the calculus for a NATO/Russia war, it merely means that we can't just nuke Belarus any more to send a message to Russia (which was actually a discussed strategy in at least one war game). The move is almost certainly more of a propaganda stunt both internally and externally.\n\nThat last point is also the biggest reason why I think Poland should not be given nukes. The US (and the West as a whole) is strong enough conventionally that it does not need to play nuclear tit for tat with Russia. It's the same with their nuclear threats. The threats and the expansion of the arsenal to Belarus (when/if it happens) are signs of weakness. Russia is afraid of NATO, as they should be. NATO has Russia right where it wants it, trapped in a quagmire bleeding away blood and treasure fighting NATO's credit card. Why does NATO need to stoop to their level? Why give them ammunition to fuel their insane ramblings? Is it because Russia needs to know that we're serious about using nukes? It's pretty clear that we are, we've communicated it enough, and sharing nukes with Poland is not going to suddenly make Russia wise up if they really do think they can call the West's bluff (god forbid). The West holds the high ground morally and strategically. There's no need to forfeit that just to give Poland an unnecessary deterrent.  \n\n\nEdit: Also, and call me crazy, I do like to dream of a world in which nuclear disarmament can still be a thing and I like to believe it will be one day. Increasing nuclear sharing in any way makes that less likely and as the West has the moral high ground, I think there is an imperative to work for a better (no nuclear weapons) world when possible.",

What about those personal attacks is civil to you? I am extending you a formal warning to moderate your tone or risk a timeout or ban. It simply is unacceptable.\n\nAs far as me being a casual, I am most definitely not, but I'm not going to credential drop on Reddit for clout.\n\nAs for your actual argument, while you pretty much failed to adequately respond to most of my points, I don't think you actually justify to me how posting nukes in Poland changes the nuclear deterrence calculus that currently exists between NATO and Russia either. That's because it doesn't. Russia already afraid of the US nuclear arsenal. They are already deterred, both in nuclear terms and conventional. Why do you think they invaded Ukraine, not the Baltics? Why do you think Putin has been rattling his nuclear saber non-stop? It's a fear-based response. The \"balance of terror\" exists right now as we speak. Adding 20 US gravity bombs to Poland is not going to scare Russia sufficiently enough to justify the headaches that such a sharing agreement will bring both domestically and abroad. As I said, the distance between Germany and Poland is not, in terms of nuclear war, strategically significant. Well, actually, it could be strategically significant because in the event of an actual conflict between NATO and Russia (god forbid) the gravity bombs in Germany are much more likely to avoid a first strike attempt than those sitting in Poland.\n\nNow, you can make the argument (and you do) that placing nuclear weapons in Poland ensures a security commitment and achieves a \"balance of fear\" because no one is going to use nukes against a country with nuclear capability. The security commitment to Poland already exists. It is called NATO. It is arguably at the second strongest point in its entire history and shows no sign of significant disunity at this time. In fact, it is expanding. You know what very well might cause disunity? Giving Poland nukes. But we'll get to that later.  I am curious how you believe the hypothetical Russia NATO war going? You speak about escalate to deescalate (not Russian doctrine or strategy by the way, you can refer to Kofman who I believe did a pretty good breakdown of the idea) and strikes. Are you discussing conventional strikes or nuclear strikes? Because there's a big difference. I fail to see a world in which the Russians could launch a nuclear strike on *a NATO state* that did not immediately result in a forceful response, almost certainly nuclear, from the US. At the very least, it could trigger the French doctrinal \"warning shot\" nuke amidst a strong conventional response. Nothing in the US' position has indicated in any way, shape, or form that it is not committed to a proportionate response principle for protecting its NATO allies. If you have some convincing evidence of the US saying it will not fulfill its treaty obligations to NATO, I would love to see it. If the US is therefore strongly committed to deterrence, I ask again what does Poland having nukes change? In a world in which US (and UK) strategic deterrence forces are deemed unreliable enough that Russia thinks it can nuke Poland, it doesn't matter how many gravity bombs sit in Poland. The US will not allow Poland to use them because Poland using US nukes on Russia would be tantamount to the US nuking Russia and would engender a similar response. The logic defeats itself: if US nuclear security guarantees are weak enough that the Russians believe they can nuke Poland, they'll say the same thing if there's 20 nukes there too because it's still the US in control. Also Karaganov and Trenin are not reliable sources.\n\nBut that's the actual strategic side. As I mentioned before, there are massive diplomatic hurdles involved in sharing nukes in Poland. It violates the 1997 NATO-Russia agreement which said that NATO would not station nukes in new members, which would just feed the fires of Russian propaganda. All members would almost certainly not agree to this decision. France would be the primary concern, I think, but other members like Turkey or (surprise surprise) Hungary could object as well. Poland was not a particularly popular member of NATO prior to the war, frustrations with their government would arise again if potential nuke sharing were discussed. Outside of NATO, increased nuclear proliferation undermines NATO's diplomatic moral high ground in the Ukraine conflict and globally. China can cite it as a reason to support Russia more and it will fuel China's concerns about similar nuclear sharing agreements in the Pacific, making it harder to bring them on side for pressuring Russia to end the war. Right now, China and India are relatively clear about Russia being out of pocket with its nuclear threats. Responding to those threats in kind would make it harder for the West to depict Russia as irrational and irresponsible. It would also fuel Russian propaganda. it's a direct confirmation both to the Russian public and to bystanders that Putin's narrative about NATO aggression is not just a fantasy. It would also retroactively justify the deployment of nuclear weapons to Belarus, a decision that at the moment is considered wrong by most of the international community. It would also encourage further nuclear proliferation by Russia. Belarus may not be the only Russia ally to get nuclear weapons and it would justify Russia placing more nuclear weapons closer to its NATO borders. In short, you're giving Russia a green light to be worse and more irresponsible with its nuclear arsenal.\n\nSo you have a decision that is strategically unnecessary, diplomatically terrible, and incredibly escalatory (at a time when the West is very much managing escalation, Russia has nothing close to \"escalation dominance\" whatever that really means). Also it costs a ton of money. For all the above, sending nukes to Poland is a poor idea at this juncture.",

                                "body": "You seem to still live in a world that ceased to exist in Feb'22 when USA deterrence spectacularly failed and existing European security architecture was shattered. A world in whatever Russia does is non-escalatory and response in kind is... somehow escalatory. You also worry that NATO moves will 'fuel Russian propaganda' which is peculiar really noting no matter what West does it's always presented the same in Russian propaganda. One simply doesn't base strategy on such premise in a time of war in the East. Similarly, Nato-Russia agreement from 1997 is effectively dead with Russia never actually implementing it. It being in place in current circumstances is the best example that failed politics that brought us the were we are are still entertained.\n\nAlso, there is no deterrence, where security balance doesn't exist. NATO 'unity' and article 5 is a POLITICAL not an autonomous decision. It's an open secret that it may or may not work depending on the environment and ruling political parties. If you adamantly believe Germany will support Poland in case of a tactical nuke or Russian conventional agreesion no matter what, well I admire your optimism, but hope is not a method in statecraft. Especially judging based on German reactions in Feb'22, Poland most certainly doesn't believe in instant German support, Balts do not believe it, Czechs/Slovaks do not believe it, Romania most likely doesn't believe it and Russia does not believe it too. German support is just as likely as Germany leaving NATO in such circumstances to embrace 'pacifism' and avoid a threat of a nuclear exchange, especially if e.g. USA is quite busy in the Pacific theater. Such scenarios were being trained during various 'games'. That's the Russian base case as well if such strategy is decided to be implemented. Reality is there's no balance within NATO itself. Still there's a division to Western Europe with large, permanent NATO (USA) forces with nuclear capability and under-militarized Central-Eastern Europe, which invites Russian action, threats and provocations as they believe former soviet pact members (even when in NATO) are still powers playground and can be if not conquered than shared influence wise. This perception must be ended or there will be no peace but more Lavrov's ultimatums.\n\nTo your question, NATO-Russia war would be quite simple really from Kremlin perspective. Politically divided NATO fails to respond to an attack/swift incursion targetting Baltic states (to defend Russian minorities in Estonia/Latvia/Lithuania of course) and tactical nukes isolation if required. Similar to what we saw in the first days of Ukrainian conflict. Political divisions take over, appeasement wins, NATO is no effectively more, Baltics are being quickly depopulated/purged from non-Russians and Central-Eastern Europe is left on its own, cause... it doesn't have required capability to create a balance of fear. What comes next it anyone guess. Probably Poland instantly enters the war on its own while German minister says 'it's not worth to support Baltic states, they lost anyway' (rings a bell?). This was very likely the next step post Ukraine invasion if it had gone as planned. The above is the actual perception of in threaten NATO countries, Estonians for instance are convinced they are next and current tripwire strategy and NATO 'non escalatory' posture is a show of weakness that only invites Russia to go further once they recover and the 'time is right'.\n\nNuclear sharing is not nuclear proliferation. In current circumstances it actually ensures more countries will not seek to develop own nuclear capability while under threat from a nuclear power. Otherwise they will start covert programs and that is most likely natural course of action anyway as the entire world had seen cities of non-nuclear country can be barraged and the victim cannot retaliate. What you're proposing (supposedly everything else is a poor diplomatic decision) in my view will actually bring us nuclear proliferation, first in Japan/South Korea, then Poland/Australia and Ukraine.\n\nSo yes, the line of thinking you represent is well known to me. In my view (supported by empirical evidence we all have witnessed) such approach brought war to Europe and had been reasonable for the 30 years post Soviet collapse. Now, another incarnation of imperial Russia is back, China is emerging as a world power hence its time to act. The world has changed, we either adapt accordingly or very likely more blood will be spilled in the next decade. First step is to ensure Russian nuclear threats are met with a swift response and support of threaten allies. Nuclear sharing eastward is a what should already be in progress. Otherwise, the countries that feel threaten will take matters in their own hands. Judging on recent event/declarations in South Korea/Japan, it has already started.",

Burns earlier this month, Ukrainian officials revealed an ambitious strategy to retake Russian-occupied territory and open cease-fire negotiations with Moscow by the end of the year, according to officials familiar with the visit.\n\n>The trip by Burns, which has not been previously reported, included meetings with President Volodymyr Zelensky and Ukraine\u2019s top intelligence officials. It came at a critical moment in the conflict as Ukrainian forces struggle to gain an early advantage in their long-awaited counteroffensive but have yet to deploy most of their Western-trained and -equipped assault brigades.\n\n>\u201cDirector Burns recently traveled to Ukraine, as he has done regularly since the beginning of Russia\u2019s recent aggression more than a year ago,\u201d said a U.S. official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the unannounced visit.\n\n>Its purpose was to reaffirm the Biden administration\u2019s commitment to sharing intelligence meant to help Ukraine defend itself, the official added.\n\n>Publicly, Ukrainian officials have expressed frustration with critics of the pace at which the counteroffensive has played out thus far. But in private, **military planners in Kyiv have relayed to Burns and others bullish confidence in their aim to retake substantial territory by the fall; move artillery and missile systems near the boundary line of Russian-controlled Crimea; push further into eastern Ukraine; and then open negotiations with Moscow for the first time since peace talks broke down in March of last year,** according to three people familiar with the planning.\n\n>\u201cRussia will only negotiate if it feels threatened,\u201d said a senior Ukrainian official.\n\n>Whether Ukraine can deliver on those plans, on such a truncated timeline, remains to be seen. The CIA declined to comment when asked for Burns\u2019s assessment of the offensive\u2019s prospects.\n\n>Burns\u2019s trip occurred just before the aborted rebellion by Russian mercenary leader Yevgeniy Prigozhin against Russia\u2019s defense establishment. Although the U.S. intelligence community had detected in mid-June that Prigozhin was plotting an armed assault of some kind, those findings were not discussed during the meetings with Zelensky and others, the U.S. official said.\n\n>Biden administration officials have repeatedly emphasized that Washington and Kyiv had nothing to do with the failed march on Moscow, a rare challenge to Russian President Vladimir Putin that the United States has characterized as an internal matter.\n\n>In an effort to reinforce that line, Burns made a phone call to his Russian counterpart, Sergei Naryshkin, after the event and underscored that the United States was not involved in any way, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\n>Zelensky and his military commanders, facing deeply entrenched Russian forces in occupied parts of Ukraine\u2019s east and south, are under extraordinary pressure from the Western nations that provided Kyiv with billions of dollars in advanced weaponry and training ahead of the counteroffensive.\n\n>Ukraine has taken heavy casualties as its troops and armored vehicles navigate thick minefields and fortified trenches across wide-open territory. The challenging terrain has left troops vulnerable to Russian airstrikes and missile attacks.\n\n>Zelensky has acknowledged that the counteroffensive is going \u201cslower than desired,\u201d and officials have confirmed the destruction of some Western-provided Leopard 2 tanks and Bradley Fighting Vehicles.\n\n>But Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov has dismissed skeptics, saying the \u201cmain event\u201d is yet to come, while the country\u2019s top military commander, Gen. Valery Zaluzhny, has called for patience, saying the offensive is being \u201ccarried out\u201d as diligently as possible.\n\n>\u201cYes, maybe not as fast as \u2026 the observers would like, but that is their problem,\u201d Zaluzhny told The Washington Post this week.\n\n>Military analysts say Ukraine\u2019s goal of forcing a negotiation is ambitious given Russia\u2019s fortified defenses, but not out of the question.\n\n>\u201cIt\u2019s possible they can cut off the land bridge to Crimea, either by seizing the terrain or putting it within range of HIMARS and other artillery, but much depends on the level of attrition,\u201d said Rob Lee, a military analyst at the Foreign Policy Research Institute.\n\n>\u201cIf Ukraine sustains too many losses, its offensive could culminate early. But if Ukraine can inflict enough losses on Russian forces and equipment, and interdict the movement of reinforcements, Ukraine may be able to weaken Moscow\u2019s defenses enough to achieve a breakthrough,\u201d he added.\n\n>In preparation for the fall, **Zelensky and top aides have begun thinking about how Kyiv can force an end to the fighting on terms that are acceptable to Russia and the Ukrainian people,** who have been subjected to a year and a half of violence, forced displacement, atrocities, and food and electricity shortages.\n\n>In an ideal scenario favored by Kyiv, **Ukraine\u2019s military would gain leverage over Russia by advancing troops and powerful weapons to the edge of Ukraine\u2019s boundary with Crimea \u2014 holding hostage the peninsula that is home to Russia\u2019s prized Black Sea Fleet.**\n\n>\u201cIf Ukraine has the capability to target additional important airfields, bridges, rail lines and logistics hubs, they can make it more difficult for Russia to sustain the war,\u201d said Lee, the military analyst.\n\n>**In agreeing not to take Crimea by force, Kyiv would then demand that Russia accept whatever security guarantees Ukraine can secure from the West,** said Ukrainian officials.\n\n>Obtaining those guarantees, however, has been a tall order.\n\n>The Zelensky government has pushed hard for the United States and Europe to make firm commitments on Ukraine\u2019s accession to NATO and the European Union \u2014 but the U.S. and Western European governments remain cold to the idea, more interested in offering pledges of long-term security assistance instead of the expansion of NATO, which risks a direct conflict with Russia.\n\n>The hesitance has frustrated Poland and the Baltic states, NATO member countries that are looking ahead to next month\u2019s NATO summit in Lithuania, where Secretary of State Antony Blinken and other Western leaders have said they intend to provide a \u201cvery robust package\u201d to Ukraine. Strong disagreements over the contents of the package threaten to project an image of disunity at the gathering.\n\n>But while U.S. and Ukrainian officials differ on the topic of NATO membership, they say there is broad agreement on Kyiv\u2019s aims for the offensive.\n\n>\u201cThe U.S. agrees that Ukraine should enter the negotiations from a strong position,\u201d said a senior Ukrainian official. \u201cThe U.S. is satisfied that our command does not do anything stupid, it keeps soldiers and equipment. The support is strong, and it makes our motivation higher.\u201d\n\n>Still, signs of stress are abundant. While U.S. military leaders want to see Ukraine accelerate its offensive, Zaluzhny has begun venting that the West has not sent ammunition and fighter jets to the battlefield fast enough.\n\n>It \u201cpisses me off,\u201d Zaluzhny said, in response to complaints that the counteroffensive hasn\u2019t progressed quickly.\n\n>White House spokesman John Kirby on Friday sympathized with Ukrainian complaints about weaponry, saying, \u201cYou can hardly blame them for talking to the world about additional support, whether that\u2019s in quantity or quality of capabilities.\u201d\n\n>He denied, however, that Washington would play the role of \u201carmchair quarterback\u201d from the sidelines.\n\n>\u201cWhere they go and how fast they go,\u201d Kirby said, \u201cthat\u2019s really going to be up to them to decide.\u201d\n\n>Ukraine\u2019s cautious approach in the opening days of the offensive is a sign of the challenge that lies ahead, analysts say.\n\n>\u201cThe problem is that Russia has emplaced a large number of mines, both in front of and behind the main defensive line,\u201d said Lee. \u201cEven if Ukraine can achieve a breakthrough, it will still take time to exploit. It may take weeks, it may take months.\u201d",

The challenging terrain has left troops vulnerable to Russian airstrikes and missile attacks.</p>\n\n<p>Zelensky has acknowledged that the counteroffensive is going \u201cslower than desired,\u201d and officials have confirmed the destruction of some Western-provided Leopard 2 tanks and Bradley Fighting Vehicles.</p>\n\n<p>But Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov has dismissed skeptics, saying the \u201cmain event\u201d is yet to come, while the country\u2019s top military commander, Gen. Valery Zaluzhny, has called for patience, saying the offensive is being \u201ccarried out\u201d as diligently as possible.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYes, maybe not as fast as \u2026 the observers would like, but that is their problem,\u201d Zaluzhny told The Washington Post this week.</p>\n\n<p>Military analysts say Ukraine\u2019s goal of forcing a negotiation is ambitious given Russia\u2019s fortified defenses, but not out of the question.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible they can cut off the land bridge to Crimea, either by seizing the terrain or putting it within range of HIMARS and other artillery, but much depends on the level of attrition,\u201d said Rob Lee, a military analyst at the Foreign Policy Research Institute.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf Ukraine sustains too many losses, its offensive could culminate early. But if Ukraine can inflict enough losses on Russian forces and equipment, and interdict the movement of reinforcements, Ukraine may be able to weaken Moscow\u2019s defenses enough to achieve a breakthrough,\u201d he added.</p>\n\n<p>In preparation for the fall, <strong>Zelensky and top aides have begun thinking about how Kyiv can force an end to the fighting on terms that are acceptable to Russia and the Ukrainian people,</strong> who have been subjected to a year and a half of violence, forced displacement, atrocities, and food and electricity shortages.</p>\n\n<p>In an ideal scenario favored by Kyiv, <strong>Ukraine\u2019s military would gain leverage over Russia by advancing troops and powerful weapons to the edge of Ukraine\u2019s boundary with Crimea \u2014 holding hostage the peninsula that is home to Russia\u2019s prized Black Sea Fleet.</strong></p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf Ukraine has the capability to target additional important airfields, bridges, rail lines and logistics hubs, they can make it more difficult for Russia to sustain the war,\u201d said Lee, the military analyst.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In agreeing not to take Crimea by force, Kyiv would then demand that Russia accept whatever security guarantees Ukraine can secure from the West,</strong> said Ukrainian officials.</p>\n\n<p>Obtaining those guarantees, however, has been a tall order.</p>\n\n<p>The Zelensky government has pushed hard for the United States and Europe to make firm commitments on Ukraine\u2019s accession to NATO and the European Union \u2014 but the U.S. and Western European governments remain cold to the idea, more interested in offering pledges of long-term security assistance instead of the expansion of NATO, which risks a direct conflict with Russia.</p>\n\n<p>The hesitance has frustrated Poland and the Baltic states, NATO member countries that are looking ahead to next month\u2019s NATO summit in Lithuania, where Secretary of State Antony Blinken and other Western leaders have said they intend to provide a \u201cvery robust package\u201d to Ukraine. Strong disagreements over the contents of the package threaten to project an image of disunity at the gathering.</p>\n\n<p>But while U.S. and Ukrainian officials differ on the topic of NATO membership, they say there is broad agreement on Kyiv\u2019s aims for the offensive.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe U.S. agrees that Ukraine should enter the negotiations from a strong position,\u201d said a senior Ukrainian official. \u201cThe U.S. is satisfied that our command does not do anything stupid, it keeps soldiers and equipment. The support is strong, and it makes our motivation higher.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Still, signs of stress are abundant. While U.S. military leaders want to see Ukraine accelerate its offensive, Zaluzhny has begun venting that the West has not sent ammunition and fighter jets to the battlefield fast enough.</p>\n\n<p>It \u201cpisses me off,\u201d Zaluzhny said, in response to complaints that the counteroffensive hasn\u2019t progressed quickly.</p>\n\n<p>White House spokesman John Kirby on Friday sympathized with Ukrainian complaints about weaponry, saying, \u201cYou can hardly blame them for talking to the world about additional support, whether that\u2019s in quantity or quality of capabilities.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He denied, however, that Washington would play the role of \u201carmchair quarterback\u201d from the sidelines.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhere they go and how fast they go,\u201d Kirby said, \u201cthat\u2019s really going to be up to them to decide.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine\u2019s cautious approach in the opening days of the offensive is a sign of the challenge that lies ahead, analysts say.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe problem is that Russia has emplaced a large number of mines, both in front of and behind the main defensive line,\u201d said Lee. \u201cEven if Ukraine can achieve a breakthrough, it will still take time to exploit. It may take weeks, it may take months.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

                            "body": "It is very basic equipment. On its own, probably too basic to bridge a 1km river How long is that floating bridge segment? Looks to be 5 meters. Lets say 10 meters ?\n\nSo you're going to need 100 chained together for a single span. 300 for several. And 400 for several plus replacements.\n\nDoes Ukraine have 20 or 50 of these, probably. Do they have a hundred ? Maybe.  Do they have a couple of hundred or more ? No. \n\nHere is what a more modern version of this looks like deployed (this is post-soviet, so ukraines version is likely to be older than this one and so perhaps a little shorter and less eficient, but....)...\n\nhttps://imgur.com/JH4bOER\n\n>The PP-2005 Floating Bridge System was designed after the break-up of the Soviet Union. PP stands for \u201cPontonno Park\u201d or \u201cPontoon Park.\u201d The PP-2005 Floating Bridge System uses 54 trucks to haul 12 BMK tugboats, 32 floating sections, and 8 abutments to the crossing site. It can be assembled into a group of rafts or into one pontoon bridge that can span a 268 meter wide river.\n\nGoogle tells me Ukraine has 1 specialist bridging battalion with some kind of older version of these (although other units may have a few segments organic to that unit for crossing 10-20m rivers)\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2023/05/04/ukraines-pontoon-regiment-can-bridge-a-hundred-foot-river-in-30-minutes/?sh=3965aeb85b14\n\nIt seems this si the kit they have...\n\n>A full PMP set is 32 center pontoons and four ramp pontoons that fold up and travel on KRAZ-255B trucks. A truck crew dumps a pontoon into the water, where it automatically unfolds. Engineers on motor-launches maneuver the sections into one 750-foot chain, or two parallel 375-foot chains, and bolt them together with ramp segments at each end. The full bridge should support the weight of one tank at a time.\n\nSo..... assuming that this uses the same number of trucks/tugs too (despite being older kit)  you're talking about 4 sets, or 216 trucks and 48 tugboats to span the Dnipro once, with no spare segments/tugs (in fact even those 4 sets are about 300ft short, so you'd need to scavenge up another 15 segments, and 5 tugs give or take from somewhere to round it out).\n\nDoesn't say how big the regiment is.... But if its got a fairly std complement of men. And you need 2 per truck, 2 per tug and a handful of other dismount engineers/officers/ncos.... You're looking at about 1,100 men (which sounds about right for a regiment) if they have and operate 4 sets and we'll just magic up the extra half set they need from somewhere.\n\nSo..... one span.... not several spans.... no replacements (except scavenged segments from other units, and likely no tugs).... and once a tug or two gets hit, and a 30 segment chunk gets torn off by the current as a result and floats away downriver/sinks your bridge is done.\n\nI've been generous above. There is every possibility the 808th only has 2 or 3 sets which means even one span isn't possible with the equipment they have.....or that they did start the war with 4 sets, but have already used up/lost a fair chunk of the segments in the various crossings of the other rivers they've done multiple times.\n\nThese things aren't designed to do a 1km wide river. And, no, ukraine doesn't have hundreds and hundreds of them lying around. And once its up its going to be very fragile, and when it gets hit they're going to lose big chunks of it downstream ....some of which will be unrecoverable.... and I'm not sure you're going to be able to co-ordinate the 53 tugboats you need, under fire, to put it all together in the first place without a major whoopsie.",
                            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>It is very basic equipment. On its own, probably too basic to bridge a 1km river How long is that floating bridge segment? Looks to be 5 meters. Lets say 10 meters ?</p>\n\n<p>So you&#39;re going to need 100 chained together for a single span. 300 for several. And 400 for several plus replacements.</p>\n\n<p>Does Ukraine have 20 or 50 of these, probably. Do they have a hundred ? Maybe.  Do they have a couple of hundred or more ? No. </p>\n\n<p>Here is what a more modern version of this looks like deployed (this is post-soviet, so ukraines version is likely to be older than this one and so perhaps a little shorter and less eficient, but....)...</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/JH4bOER\">https://imgur.com/JH4bOER</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The PP-2005 Floating Bridge System was designed after the break-up of the Soviet Union. PP stands for \u201cPontonno Park\u201d or \u201cPontoon Park.\u201d The PP-2005 Floating Bridge System uses 54 trucks to haul 12 BMK tugboats, 32 floating sections, and 8 abutments to the crossing site. It can be assembled into a group of rafts or into one pontoon bridge that can span a 268 meter wide river.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Google tells me Ukraine has 1 specialist bridging battalion with some kind of older version of these (although other units may have a few segments organic to that unit for crossing 10-20m rivers)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2023/05/04/ukraines-pontoon-regiment-can-bridge-a-hundred-foot-river-in-30-minutes/?sh=3965aeb85b14\">https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2023/05/04/ukraines-pontoon-regiment-can-bridge-a-hundred-foot-river-in-30-minutes/?sh=3965aeb85b14</a></p>\n\n<p>It seems this si the kit they have...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>A full PMP set is 32 center pontoons and four ramp pontoons that fold up and travel on KRAZ-255B trucks. A truck crew dumps a pontoon into the water, where it automatically unfolds. Engineers on motor-launches maneuver the sections into one 750-foot chain, or two parallel 375-foot chains, and bolt them together with ramp segments at each end. The full bridge should support the weight of one tank at a time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So..... assuming that this uses the same number of trucks/tugs too (despite being older kit)  you&#39;re talking about 4 sets, or 216 trucks and 48 tugboats to span the Dnipro once, with no spare segments/tugs (in fact even those 4 sets are about 300ft short, so you&#39;d need to scavenge up another 15 segments, and 5 tugs give or take from somewhere to round it out).</p>\n\n<p>Doesn&#39;t say how big the regiment is.... But if its got a fairly std complement of men. And you need 2 per truck, 2 per tug and a handful of other dismount engineers/officers/ncos.... You&#39;re looking at about 1,100 men (which sounds about right for a regiment) if they have and operate 4 sets and we&#39;ll just magic up the extra half set they need from somewhere.</p>\n\n<p>So..... one span.... not several spans.... no replacements (except scavenged segments from other units, and likely no tugs).... and once a tug or two gets hit, and a 30 segment chunk gets torn off by the current as a result and floats away downriver/sinks your bridge is done.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve been generous above. There is every possibility the 808th only has 2 or 3 sets which means even one span isn&#39;t possible with the equipment they have.....or that they did start the war with 4 sets, but have already used up/lost a fair chunk of the segments in the various crossings of the other rivers they&#39;ve done multiple times.</p>\n\n<p>These things aren&#39;t designed to do a 1km wide river.

            "body": "The coup was decidedly not faked. Part of why this rumor continues is that most of the sources for the specifics of what happened that night remain in Turkish, as few commentators or academics care enough to translate and compile a good source.\n\nBut the coup was real. There were a few reasons why it appeared (and was, to an extent) incompetent and kind of absurd.\n\n-Timing. The officers who planned and led the coup were in part reacting to a new law/rule that would be enacted later in the summer related to officer corps/general staff reforms and the attempted civilianization of military leadership in the aftermath of both the Ergenekon trials and the longer, slower reforms begun in the late 90s as part of the liberalization for EU membership.\n\n-Time 2.0. The coup plot was discovered by internal security shortly before it was planned to begin, through interception of radio messages and tracking of unusual ordnance/aircraft movements at several airbases. The coup plotters realized they had been discovered, and began the coup many hours before they had planned. Instead of a stealthy takeover in the middle of the night, they were now attempting a takeover during a busy Friday night when most people were still awake and aware of events.\n\n-Poor coordination and lack of central goal and impetus among coup plotters. While the core of coupist officers were hardcore Gulenists, quite a few were simply opportunists who were stagnant in their careers or worried about being implicated in the political crackdowns on military officers. The coup/Gulenist networks were extremely secretive and stealthy in their operations, and thus many officers only knew one or two other people in the network, and there was no clear leader or central planning and coordination. The coup occurred and was coordinated via WhatsApp group chats, and as events spiraled out of control, there was no real plan B.\n\n-The military didn't cooperate. Had the coup attempt occurred 10, 15, 20 years prior, it likely would have succeeded. But the Turkish armed forces of 2016 and that of 1996 were two very different beasts, culturally speaking. Since the attempt to enter the EU starting in the late 90s, the military-civilian relationship in government underwent significant reforms, greatly increasing civilian oversight and control of military matters, while reducing the importance of the military general staff over government affairs. Similarly, the culture and makeup of the officer corps began to change as Turkey's economic position began to change. In 1996, a Turkish military school was arguably the most prestigious school an ambitious young man could attend. In 2016, that was far from the case. Turkish civilian education had dramatically improved since then, and culturally the military had lost prestige. As a result, younger officers were generally more careerist, hoping to use the military as an opportunity to advance rather than as ideologues, who believed in the original idea of the military in Turkey as an institution overseeing the ideological foundation of the Turkish Republic. Only an increasingly small cadre of older legacy officers believed in that mission in 2016. The coup began with coupist officers attempting to get the head of the Turkish general staff to basically announce that the Turkish military had taken over control of the government. He did not agree to do so, and was held at gunpoint. Similarly, in Istanbul, the head of the army in that region figured out what was going on very quickly and acted immediately against the Coupists, causing disarray in the plans of the coup plotters. With the military split, and key units refusing to partake or in many cases actively fighting against the coupists, the coup was doomed from the start. In previous decades, there likely would not have been this split.\n\n-The civilian population did not cooperate. Much like the military, the civilian population of Turkey had undergone a cultural shift in the decades preceding 2016. The Turkish people, regardless of their political beliefs, largely believe in democracy. The 2016 coup was viewed by most, including young anti-Erdogan progressives, as an attack on Turkish democracy and an attempt to drag Turkey back to the \"bad old days\" of the 70s and 80s. Combine that with the coupists shooting anti-coup protesters with live ammo, running over them with tanks, etc., and you get a broad coalition of the civilian population who oppose the coup at all costs.\n\nAll this combined to mean the coup was doomed from the start. A combination of rushed planning, rushed implementation, and a military and civilian culture that would not cooperate with the coup, and you get the result we got.\n\nOf course, Erdogan was more than happy to exploit it after the fact for his own benefit. But it was not a false flag.",

The coup/Gulenist networks were extremely secretive and stealthy in their operations, and thus many officers only knew one or two other people in the network, and there was no clear leader or central planning and coordination. The coup occurred and was coordinated via WhatsApp group chats, and as events spiraled out of control, there was no real plan B.</p>\n\n<p>-The military didn&#39;t cooperate. Had the coup attempt occurred 10, 15, 20 years prior, it likely would have succeeded. But the Turkish armed forces of 2016 and that of 1996 were two very different beasts, culturally speaking. Since the attempt to enter the EU starting in the late 90s, the military-civilian relationship in government underwent significant reforms, greatly increasing civilian oversight and control of military matters, while reducing the importance of the military general staff over government affairs. Similarly, the culture and makeup of the officer corps began to change as Turkey&#39;s economic position began to change. In 1996, a Turkish military school was arguably the most prestigious school an ambitious young man could attend. In 2016, that was far from the case. Turkish civilian education had dramatically improved since then, and culturally the military had lost prestige. As a result, younger officers were generally more careerist, hoping to use the military as an opportunity to advance rather than as ideologues, who believed in the original idea of the military in Turkey as an institution overseeing the ideological foundation of the Turkish Republic. Only an increasingly small cadre of older legacy officers believed in that mission in 2016. The coup began with coupist officers attempting to get the head of the Turkish general staff to basically announce that the Turkish military had taken over control of the government. He did not agree to do so, and was held at gunpoint. Similarly, in Istanbul, the head of the army in that region figured out what was going on very quickly and acted immediately against the Coupists, causing disarray in the plans of the coup plotters. With the military split, and key units refusing to partake or in many cases actively fighting against the coupists, the coup was doomed from the start. In previous decades, there likely would not have been this split.</p>\n\n<p>-The civilian population did not cooperate. Much like the military, the civilian population of Turkey had undergone a cultural shift in the decades preceding 2016. The Turkish people, regardless of their political beliefs, largely believe in democracy. The 2016 coup was viewed by most, including young anti-Erdogan progressives, as an attack on Turkish democracy and an attempt to drag Turkey back to the &quot;bad old days&quot; of the 70s and 80s. Combine that with the coupists shooting anti-coup protesters with live ammo, running over them with tanks, etc., and you get a broad coalition of the civilian population who oppose the coup at all costs.</p>\n\n<p>All this combined to mean the coup was doomed from the start. A combination of rushed planning, rushed implementation, and a military and civilian culture that would not cooperate with the coup, and you get the result we got.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, Erdogan was more than happy to exploit it after the fact for his own benefit. But it was not a false flag.</p>\n</div>",

I went through some sources to look if they were deployed and it looks like a lot of these brigades have been at the front. \n\nOperational Command North \n\n- 112th was definitely in Bakhmut, reported by [both RU](https://twitter.com/djuric_zlatko/status/1659841892782096384) and [UA sources](https://twitter.com/vik8867dn/status/1655216178841673728). They were also in Kherson in late 2022. \n\n- Rybar reported in Feb that the [113th was in Bakhmut](https://twitter.com/sammy590045953/status/1628127684156071937)\n\n- 116th TDF got heavily attrited in the Bakhmut and Maryinka \ndirections in May, in fact one of [their commanding officers was KIA](https://twitter.com/visegrad24/status/1660423793309892616) last month\n\n- 118th TDF is currently at the front. [Footage from yesterday](https://twitter.com/Feher_Junior/status/1673936487820263425) \n\n- 119th was *definitely* at the front, and likely had heavy losses.

It's not a new development, it's been used extensively in Syrian, in Chechnya and, before that, in Afghanistan. It's not formally acknowledged because it goes against several international treaties that Russia has signed, but we know of its existence based on the Russian army's conduct in the First Chechen war, when not only deliberate strikes on civilian zones (which can otherwise be ascribed to poor information gathering), but also the obstruction of civilian evacuation and reprisals against civilians, were either the result of explicit orders, or tacitly approved by the command hierarchy.\n\nIt's backed by a line of thinking related to the importance of civilian support for insurgencies and elected regimes -- it has, in fact, shown localized or tactical advantages (see e.g. the aftermath of the Samashki massacre).\n\nSecond, there is a significant difference in terms of operational *planning*. The experience of the Vietnam war and the political shockwave it generated caused Western planners to re-evaluate the importance of civilian casualties, to the point where high potential for civilian casualties is sufficient reason not to authorize an operation. The Russian army formally acknowledges this as well, but in practice, Russian leaders have been far more willing to authorize operations with a high potential for civilian casualties.\n\nConsequently, even in the absence of a deliberate willingness to attack civilians (which is also a thing, but not constantly and equally practiced throughout the Russian army), the Russian political and military leadership simply expends relatively few resources avoiding, and is far more tolerant to, civilian casualties.\n\nCase in point: even NATO's bombing campaign against Serbia in 1999, which abounded in catastrophic mistakes and resulted in embarrassingly high civilian casualty figures (by Western standards) involved a lot of wrangling over target selection, and targets were routinely refused because it wasn't clear they could be safely struck, or their military character was not deemed clear enough (e.g. some radio and TV stations -- they were all nationalized at one point, so they would've qualified as legitimate targets from a strictly legal perspectiv). The civilian casualties that ensued were grounds for justified harsh criticism of the planning phase, yet they are dwarfed by those caused by the Russian army in Ukraine.\n\nThat has real-life results -- including, for instance, that Russian command tends to be more willing to authorize strikes based on HUMINT. These routinely go wrong, not necessarily because agents are unreliable (although that's a real problem, too) but because there's often some lag between reports and events. So lots of things can change -- meetings are moved or postponed, word gets out of a leak etc. -- and you end up striking the wrong place, or at the wrong time, or both.\n\nThis is, however, a result of not just Russian policy, but also a result of the capabilities and doctrine of the Russian army. Russia can't afford precision strike weapons on the same scale NATO can, they are expensive and there's simply not as much money available to make them. For a long time, it also lagged behind in terms of technical capabilities, and it still lags behind in terms of operator expertise. So poor accuracy, in addition to being somewhat more tolerated upstairs, is also baked in the technical capabilities and expertise of some (but not all!) Russian units.\n\nFinally, reporting bias absolutely is a thing. Civilian casualties are an extraordinarily relevant topic in Europe. It's only the youngest Europeans, people who are 20, 30 at most, and not even all of those, that got to live in families that don't have a long history of forced displacement, dead children, and lost parents. Like, all of my grandparents had to live the places where they were born; all of them lost brothers or parents in the war; virtually everyone their age had seen bombed out homes; and many of them had seen summary executions, some of them by both the Wehrmacht and the Red Army.\n\nIt's impossible to overstate the effect these things have in the minds of people past a certain (and not *that* advanced age), so publishing them absolutely does have an important PR impact.",

Could they have theoretically 'won' or forced some sort of agreement in a situation where they made much better decisions far earlier after the initial disaster at Kyiv?\n\nIMHO no. The initial disaster at Kyiv was the \"original sin\" of the operation. The much better decisions would have had to be made *prior* to the failed thrust on Kyiv.\n\nThe failure to take Kyiv was what made the entire political situation untenable:\n\n* It inevitably committed Russia to maintaining whatever territories they could secure, as any further retreat would've compounded the already failed Northern assault. Military imperatives would've called for the immediate abandonment of Kherson or the precariously-held positions near Kharkiv, but political imperatives made that impossible.\n* It gave the Ukrainian administration time to secure military and economic assistance.\n* It gave the greater public and Ukraine's partners time to reflect on what happened, and resulted in enormous public support for Ukraine, which meant that it could secure military and economic assistance from lots of countries, whereas Russia was forced to seek military and economic assistance with countries that were either already in a bad position (Iran) or reluctant to help (China) an isolated country that just failed to fulfill what had already looked like a very achievable goal.\n* It forced the Russian government to commit to an elusive \"final victory\": the war started with a stark and unexpected failure, so anything short of achieving their initial goals *during the same war* would have inevitably been regarded as a defeat, prematurely ending Russian ambitions of regaining major superpower status.\n\nThere were lots of ways in which operational planning or tactics could have been improved in the wake of the resounding failure to take Kyiv. And we've actually seen some improvements in these areas, too. But I think that failure deprieved Russia of the immediate means to take decisive action anywhere else. This was an inevitable failure, inherent to poor initial planning and to poor conduct of the operations on the Kyiv front. Winning a subsequent war of attrition was the only military means available to salvage the greater war effort.\n\nBetter *political* action, both before and after the invasion, might have salvaged Russia's geopolitical aims more quickly -- the war isn't over yet, so whether those can still be salvaged is still anyone's guess; but militarily, no, I think this was inevitable. It would've taken political action to avoid it and while the Russian leadership already lacked both the ability (realistic, flexible leaders who could conceive efficient policies) and the capability (a reliable state apparatus and diplomatic corps) to implement it, by May 2022 it also lacked the international credibility for it.",

During the first 10 months of the war in 2022 according to the official and not very adequate statistics, more than 45 thousand Ukrainians received the status of a person with disabilities,&quot; Valeriy Sushkevich said.  </p>\n\n<p>According to him, the actual number of people who received disability is much higher because it is difficult to obtain the official status of person with disability during the war.  </p>\n\n<p>Earlier we reported that the president signed a law making it more difficult for close relatives of the disabled of the first and second groups to be exempted from mobilization.  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a> .me/stranaua/112392</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",
