The estimated 4-5 years isn't so much a estimate based on the complexity of a 155mm shell, it's an estimate based on the relative lack of ready capacity to make new a 155mm shell production line. Which makes sense - what tooling companies are going to leave spare capacity waiting around for a 155mm shell production line order. \n\nShort term production ramping is just about spare capacity.

        "body": ">**[Western sanctions catch up with Russia\u2019s wartime economy](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/11/26/russia-war-economy-military-supply/)**\n\n>Western sanctions catch up with Russia\u2019s wartime economy\n\n>When Russian President Vladimir Putin launched last month a new council for coordinating supplies for the Russian army, he seemed to recognize the scale of the economic problems facing the country, and his sense of urgency was palpable.\n\n>\u201cWe have to be faster in deciding questions connected to supplying the special military operation and countering restrictions on the economy which, without any exaggeration, are truly unprecedented,\u201d he said.\n\n>For months, Putin claimed that the \u201ceconomic blitzkrieg\u201d against Russia had failed, but Western sanctions imposed over the invasion of Ukraine are digging ever deeper into Russia\u2019s economy, exacerbating equipment shortages for its army and hampering its ability to launch any new ground offensive or build new missiles, economists and Russian businessmen said.\n\n>Recent figures show the situation has worsened considerably since the summer when, buoyed by a steady stream of oil and gas revenue, the Russian economy seemed to stabilize. Figures released by the Finance Ministry last week show a key economic indicator \u2014 tax revenue from the non-oil and gas sector \u2014 fell 20 percent year in October compared to a year earlier, while the Russian state statistics agency Rosstat reported that retail sales fell 10 percent year on year in September, and cargo turnover fell 7 percent.\n\n\n>\u201cAll objective indicators show there is a very strong drop in economic activity,\u201d said Vladimir Milov, a former Russian deputy energy minister who is now a leading opposition politician in exile. \u201cThe spiral is escalating, and there is no way out of this now.\u201d\n\n>The Western ban on technology imports is affecting most sectors of the economy, while the Kremlin\u2019s forced mobilization of more than 300,000 Russian conscripts to serve in Ukraine, combined with the departure of at least as many abroad fleeing the draft, has dealt a further blow, economists said. In addition, Putin\u2019s own restrictions on gas supplies to Europe, followed by the unexplained explosion of the Nord Stream gas pipeline, has led to a sharp drop in gas production \u2014 down 20 percent in October compared to the previous year. Meanwhile, oil sales to Europe are plummeting ahead of the European Union embargo expected to be imposed Dec. 5.\n\n>The Kremlin has trumpeted a lower-than-expected decline in GDP, forecast by the International Monetary Fund at only 3.5 percent this year, as demonstrating that the Russian economy can weather the raft of draconian sanctions.\n\n>But economists and businessmen said the headline GDP figures did not reflect the real state of the Russian economy because the Russian government effectively ended the ruble\u2019s convertibility since the sanctions were imposed. **\u201cGDP stopped having any meaning because firstly we don\u2019t know what the real ruble rate is, and secondly if you produce a tank and send it to the front where it is immediately blown up, then it is still considered as value added,\u201d** said Milov, who wrote a report explaining the situation for the Wilfried Martens Centre for European Studies published this month.\n\n>Deeper problems were also lurking in the Russian banking sector where most accounting has been classified. The Russian Central Bank reported this week that a record $14.7 billion in hard currency was withdrawn from the Russian banking system in October, amid increasing anxiety over mobilization and the state of the economy.\n\n>Even so, a November report by the Central Bank warned that Russia\u2019s GDP would face a sharper contraction of 7.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022, after falling 4.1 percent and 4 percent compared to last year in the previous two quarters. \n\n>Last week, as the Russian economy officially entered into recession, Central Bank chairwoman Elvira Nabiullina told lawmakers that next year the situation could get darker still. \u201cWe really need to look at the situation very soberly and with our eyes open.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/11/26/russia-war-economy-military-supply/\">Western sanctions catch up with Russia\u2019s wartime economy</a></strong></p>\n\n<p>Western sanctions catch up with Russia\u2019s wartime economy</p>\n\n<p>When Russian President Vladimir Putin launched last month a new council for coordinating supplies for the Russian army, he seemed to recognize the scale of the economic problems facing the country, and his sense of urgency was palpable.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe have to be faster in deciding questions connected to supplying the special military operation and countering restrictions on the economy which, without any exaggeration, are truly unprecedented,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>For months, Putin claimed that the \u201ceconomic blitzkrieg\u201d against Russia had failed, but Western sanctions imposed over the invasion of Ukraine are digging ever deeper into Russia\u2019s economy, exacerbating equipment shortages for its army and hampering its ability to launch any new ground offensive or build new missiles, economists and Russian businessmen said.</p>\n\n<p>Recent figures show the situation has worsened considerably since the summer when, buoyed by a steady stream of oil and gas revenue, the Russian economy seemed to stabilize. Figures released by the Finance Ministry last week show a key economic indicator \u2014 tax revenue from the non-oil and gas sector \u2014 fell 20 percent year in October compared to a year earlier, while the Russian state statistics agency Rosstat reported that retail sales fell 10 percent year on year in September, and cargo turnover fell 7 percent.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAll objective indicators show there is a very strong drop in economic activity,\u201d said Vladimir Milov, a former Russian deputy energy minister who is now a leading opposition politician in exile. \u201cThe spiral is escalating, and there is no way out of this now.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The Western ban on technology imports is affecting most sectors of the economy, while the Kremlin\u2019s forced mobilization of more than 300,000 Russian conscripts to serve in Ukraine, combined with the departure of at least as many abroad fleeing the draft, has dealt a further blow, economists said. In addition, Putin\u2019s own restrictions on gas supplies to Europe, followed by the unexplained explosion of the Nord Stream gas pipeline, has led to a sharp drop in gas production \u2014 down 20 percent in October compared to the previous year. Meanwhile, oil sales to Europe are plummeting ahead of the European Union embargo expected to be imposed Dec. 5.</p>\n\n<p>The Kremlin has trumpeted a lower-than-expected decline in GDP, forecast by the International Monetary Fund at only 3.5 percent this year, as demonstrating that the Russian economy can weather the raft of draconian sanctions.</p>\n\n<p>But economists and businessmen said the headline GDP figures did not reflect the real state of the Russian economy because the Russian government effectively ended the ruble\u2019s convertibility since the sanctions were imposed. <strong>\u201cGDP stopped having any meaning because firstly we don\u2019t know what the real ruble rate is, and secondly if you produce a tank and send it to the front where it is immediately blown up, then it is still considered as value added,\u201d</strong> said Milov, who wrote a report explaining the situation for the Wilfried Martens Centre for European Studies published this month.</p>\n\n<p>Deeper problems were also lurking in the Russian banking sector where most accounting has been classified. The Russian Central Bank reported this week that a record $14.7 billion in hard currency was withdrawn from the Russian banking system in October, amid increasing anxiety over mobilization and the state of the economy.</p>\n\n<p>Even so, a November report by the Central Bank warned that Russia\u2019s GDP would face a sharper contraction of 7.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022, after falling 4.1 percent and 4 percent compared to last year in the previous two quarters. </p>\n\n<p>Last week, as the Russian economy officially entered into recession, Central Bank chairwoman Elvira Nabiullina told lawmakers that next year the situation could get darker still. \u201cWe really need to look at the situation very soberly and with our eyes open. Things may get worse, we understand that,\u201d she said.</p>\n\n<p>Putin\u2019s announcement in September of a partial troop mobilization dealt an enormous blow to business sentiment. <strong>\u201cFor many Russian companies the reality of the war sank in,\u201d</strong> said Janis Kluge, senior associate at the German Institute for Security and International Affairs. \u201cIt became clear that this is going to continue for a long time.

That's a extra person to obtain while facing manpower shortages, then train and equip. Russia's main tank is the T-72, followed by the T-80. These two series of tanks share very little in regards to commonality, meaning entirely different logistics trains to support them. Along with two sets of people to maintain the two different lines of tanks. Ignoring the various guided munitions available to different variants of the T-72/80, they both use the same propellant charges and munitions, which simplifies things. The T-62 uses a fixed 115mm round, fixed meaning the propellant charge and round are a complete object, while the T-72/80 use a separate loading 125mm munition. So the second primary disadvantage is the T-62 requires a entirely different logistics train of spares parts, ammunition, and people to maintain it. That's a serious implication for a military that objectively speaking, has terrible logistic capabilities. On the positive side for Russia the T-62 is much more simple machine than a T-72/80/90.\n\nIn regards to armor, that's such a complicated question. Even the base T-72 has much better frontal armor, armor wise it was most protected tank made at the time of it's introduction. However tanks are weak from the any place that isn't the front. A NLAW, Javelin, TOW, are all fairly likely to kill any of the above tanks, and the T-62 likely has better crew survivability for when there is a penetration. \n\nIt's certainly a significant downgrade from the hundreds of modernized T-72B3 obj  2011 and T-72B3 obj 2016s Russia has lost. However the T-62 can still function as what most of these tanks are likely being used for, a armored unit to lead attacks while providing direct fire artillery support.

Free space optics links are used in networking with fixed base stations somewhat, and even there they have pretty poor reliability vs weather/moisture.

Remotely piloted systems make the job easier, but have their own problems (how many remotely piloted tanks can one man control, is it worth having five guys drive five guns far away from the FEBA or is it better to have twenty guys and five guns in the FEBA who can dismount and do other shit?)\n\nBelow is a good description of the technological problem, but there are doctrinal questions unique to ground vehicles that compound the tech problems. In the air, the use case makes sense. Drones can go forward and act as remote radar vehicles, or can fly wingman with extra missiles or equipment. They can follow ships and act as low observable arsenal ships. But what exactly do you want a ground based drone to do? Is it much better than a mine, drive up, take a position, hose down anything that moves (also, in terms of truly autonomous: what happens the first time a drone blows away a civilian convoy? Or picks the minivan filled with refugees instead of the truck filled with hard core fighters? Or has a blue-on-blue?) This technology is really already here with smart-mines. You could have drones act as forward sensors, but the better your weapon the heavier a vehicle youll need. A scout the size or a Prius is far easier to spot than two guys and a laser designator. And how exactly would you integrate a fleet of remote tanks into a platoon? Do you have one commander and four autonomous vehicles? What happens to them if the commander gets hit? Does the tank get a fifth crewman (and thus make it an even larger target?) to pilot the drones, or will the TC get a new job? Maybe the drones just follow a radio signal, nevermind the impact the radio duckcall would have on the units stealth, at a set spacing. But do you need five tank guns in 20m increments away from the mother tank? \n\nThese questions arn't just little doctrinal points someone can answer in a manual and say 'good enough,' rather they will impact the kinds of technology the US Army intends to acquire. Some can be integrated with existing concepts and technologies, other require a fresh start. For example adding a fifth man to the tank would require moving past the Abrams, which in itself is a huge change.
