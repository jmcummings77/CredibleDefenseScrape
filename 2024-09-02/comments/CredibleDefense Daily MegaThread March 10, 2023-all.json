Pursuing a nuclear weapons program would be the opposite of that. Nuclear weapon programs are never secret for long, which is a problem since they take a while to get to where they're useful. Both Iran and North Korea have been under severe economic sanctions and while it may not have stopped them, nobody would describe either economically powerful or wealthy. \n\nA nuclear weapon's defensive utility for Saudi Arabia would also be dubious. If someone starts slinging nukes in the Middle East, they're going to be close enough that any interception systems are going to be moot and/or fallout will hit a lot of countries. The argument could be made it would protect Saudi Arabia from external invasion; however a strong conventional military with threats to large economic disruption would do the same with the economic damage that sanctions would bring. \n\nOn the other hand, if they're looking to continue their same approach of wealth buying influence and protection, a civilian nuclear program makes sense. With Saudi Arabia's oil influence starting to wane and their own energy needs growing, a move to large scale civilian nuclear power generation would help offset both. They could export more oil even if it is cheaper, and use the nuke plants in conjunction with even more desalination plants to provide economic security for their own industries while possibly leveraging water sales to the region to increase influence. \n\nThat wealth could be used to maintain a strong conventional military with a defensive focus. The Russo-Ukraine war shows that overlapping air defenses make it difficult and costly to gain air dominance, and using land based missiles would make it costly to operate off Saudi Arabia's coasts. Coupled with oil and possibly water disruptions a war would bring, this could be used as a deterrent to an invasion. There's also the cultural aspect of the fighting around the two holiest sites in Islam that would deter most of their neighbors. \n\nUp until recently, Saudi Arabia didn't have a partner that could help provide a civilian nuclear program and provide security assistance without a lot of strings attached to domestic policy. However, China has recently stepped into the role. It doesn't care about Saudi Arabia's domestic politics, has experience building a lot of nuclear power plants, has a goal of doing it in Belt and Road partner countries (which KSA is), and is willing and able to sell arms.

        "body": "Prominent UA mil-figures are warning of the dangers of holding Bakhmut for longer.\n\nHere's a well-known drone operator from 93rd Brigade: https://twitter.com/slovyanskasil/status/1634277683260542982\n\n> As soon as the Russians take the road to Khromovo, Bakhmut will gradually begin to transform from a fortress into a large mass grave. Then there will be no point in keeping silent about things that have been bothering you for many months. Maybe someone will see treason in them, but I will not care. Patience is running out.\n\nIn comments, he seems to imply that this is General Sirsky's idea and thinks that if Ukrainians stay for a while longer, all of the equipment will have to be left in Bakhmut as they eventually retreat under fire.\n\nProminent TG channel Vae Victis also comments the following: https://t. me/adbestias/6794\n\n> \"Drinking in pressure\" is what happened during the entire more than six months of Bakhmut's defense. Hundreds and thousands of soldiers plunged their lives into the advancing ranks of the enemy, sacrificing their lives for the sake of holding the next landing for a few more days, weeks or months. This continues even now, only in much worse conditions than not long ago.\n\n> The enemy did not manage to cut off the last supply channel to Bakhmut as quickly as he would have liked. However, this supply channel does not look like one that can sustain the city's defenses for at least another couple of weeks - it is narrow and vulnerable to enemy artillery, which is adjusted from UAVs. How to effectively hold the defense in tough urban battles, when a medevac is stuck in the mud of early spring on a single dirt road? Is it worth it?\n\n> Our military leadership probably thinks it's worth it. I have no doubt that this is a military decision, not a political one, as some nasty tabloids wrote - for the enemy to advance further, it is necessary to overcome the water barrier and be trapped in the dense urban development of the city center and the massive northern industrial zone. In such conditions, it is possible to inflict significant losses on the enemy, and eventually force him to stop offensive actions earlier due to the depletion of reserves, which can save such cities as Chasiv Yar, Toretsk and Konstantinivka from the transfer of battles to their territory. An additional factor is the growing conflict within the occupying forces - yes, the bandit leader Prigozhin openly enters into conflict with the military leadership of the Russian Federation in order to increase the supply of ammunition for units of the Wagner criminal group. Due to the exhaustion of Soviet warehouses, the Russian military leadership began to more strictly ration ammunition for artillery units, and fortunately for us, the sociopath Prigozhin refuses to accept this information and introduces internal discord into the ranks of the advancing troops, believing that this is a conspiracy against him personally. This conflict has a tendency to escalate, and favorable conditions may finally be created for it to erupt. However, not everything is so smooth.\n\n> Currently, the enemy has occupied Dubovo-Vasylivka and continues its attempts to capture Bohdanivka. He realized that he will not be able to close the encirclement along the outskirts of the city so easily, so he tries to continue digging under the \"lifeline\", making the reach deeper and deeper, and the only channel of communication more and more vulnerable - it may even turn out that the battles on the outskirts of the Chasiv Yar will begin before the Defense Forces leave the city of Bakhmut. This can lead to catastrophic consequences - the longer the vulnerable section of the front, the greater the probability that somewhere it will not be possible to hold it and the garrison will be surrounded before our military leadership can conduct countermeasures.\n\n> Bakhmut is an important node of our defense. However, its importance is declining faster due to the fact that the city continues to be flanked. In conditions where communications are difficult, and even the evacuation of the wounded becomes too risky, the question of the effectiveness of its defense from the point of view of the loss ratio becomes more and more ambiguous.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Prominent UA mil-figures are warning of the dangers of holding Bakhmut for longer.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s a well-known drone operator from 93rd Brigade: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/slovyanskasil/status/1634277683260542982\">https://twitter.com/slovyanskasil/status/1634277683260542982</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>As soon as the Russians take the road to Khromovo, Bakhmut will gradually begin to transform from a fortress into a large mass grave. Then there will be no point in keeping silent about things that have been bothering you for many months. Maybe someone will see treason in them, but I will not care. Patience is running out.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In comments, he seems to imply that this is General Sirsky&#39;s idea and thinks that if Ukrainians stay for a while longer, all of the equipment will have to be left in Bakhmut as they eventually retreat under fire.</p>\n\n<p>Prominent TG channel Vae Victis also comments the following: <a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a>. me/adbestias/6794</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Drinking in pressure&quot; is what happened during the entire more than six months of Bakhmut&#39;s defense. Hundreds and thousands of soldiers plunged their lives into the advancing ranks of the enemy, sacrificing their lives for the sake of holding the next landing for a few more days, weeks or months. This continues even now, only in much worse conditions than not long ago.</p>\n\n<p>The enemy did not manage to cut off the last supply channel to Bakhmut as quickly as he would have liked. However, this supply channel does not look like one that can sustain the city&#39;s defenses for at least another couple of weeks - it is narrow and vulnerable to enemy artillery, which is adjusted from UAVs. How to effectively hold the defense in tough urban battles, when a medevac is stuck in the mud of early spring on a single dirt road? Is it worth it?</p>\n\n<p>Our military leadership probably thinks it&#39;s worth it. I have no doubt that this is a military decision, not a political one, as some nasty tabloids wrote - for the enemy to advance further, it is necessary to overcome the water barrier and be trapped in the dense urban development of the city center and the massive northern industrial zone. In such conditions, it is possible to inflict significant losses on the enemy, and eventually force him to stop offensive actions earlier due to the depletion of reserves, which can save such cities as Chasiv Yar, Toretsk and Konstantinivka from the transfer of battles to their territory. An additional factor is the growing conflict within the occupying forces - yes, the bandit leader Prigozhin openly enters into conflict with the military leadership of the Russian Federation in order to increase the supply of ammunition for units of the Wagner criminal group. Due to the exhaustion of Soviet warehouses, the Russian military leadership began to more strictly ration ammunition for artillery units, and fortunately for us, the sociopath Prigozhin refuses to accept this information and introduces internal discord into the ranks of the advancing troops, believing that this is a conspiracy against him personally. This conflict has a tendency to escalate, and favorable conditions may finally be created for it to erupt. However, not everything is so smooth.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, the enemy has occupied Dubovo-Vasylivka and continues its attempts to capture Bohdanivka. He realized that he will not be able to close the encirclement along the outskirts of the city so easily, so he tries to continue digging under the &quot;lifeline&quot;, making the reach deeper and deeper, and the only channel of communication more and more vulnerable - it may even turn out that the battles on the outskirts of the Chasiv Yar will begin before the Defense Forces leave the city of Bakhmut. This can lead to catastrophic consequences - the longer the vulnerable section of the front, the greater the probability that somewhere it will not be possible to hold it and the garrison will be surrounded before our military leadership can conduct countermeasures.</p>\n\n<p>Bakhmut is an important node of our defense. However, its importance is declining faster due to the fact that the city continues to be flanked. In conditions where communications are difficult, and even the evacuation of the wounded becomes too risky, the question of the effectiveness of its defense from the point of view of the loss ratio becomes more and more ambiguous. It will not be a lie to say that the situation continues to deteriorate \u2014 there is an invariable tendency to gradually dislodge the Defense Forces from their positions, &quot;deep&quot; counterattacks that pushed the enemy far away, during which there were virtually no battles for the city. This cannot continue forever - the situation must either be radically changed by a successful counterattack with the involvement of significant reserves and the subsequent occupation of frontiers advantageous to us, or the city must finally be abandoned in order to preserve personnel.</p>\n\n<p>I sincerely hope for the wisdom of our military leadership.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

        "body": ">[Has Putin\u2019s assault on Ukraine\u2019s power grid failed?](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-64899045)\n\n>Ukrainians are enjoying the onset of spring. The nights are still cold, but they are emerging from a winter of Russian missile strikes that have cut their power, heating and their water too.\nThe winter was very hard but it was now over, declared President Volodymyr Zelensky. Ukraine still had heat and the country was unbreakable, was the message.\n\n>Until Thursday, Ukraine had just gone for more than three weeks in a row with no blackouts and and even had surplus in the system.\n\n>There had been no Russian attacks for three weeks either, and it looked as if Vladimir Putin's battle to bring down Ukraine's supply was over.\n\"Yes, we're doing it, but who started it?\" he said in December, pinning the blame on Kyiv.\n\n>It was a far more desperate story at that point. As much as half the energy infrastructure was damaged and a Ukrainian nuclear security expert warned the situation was close to critical.\n\n>But during those weeks of quiet, Russia had been stocking up weaponry. In the early hours of Thursday it fired 81 missiles and left four regions grappling with emergency power cuts. By Friday, half a million people still had no power in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-biggest city.\n\n>\"It's totally cold now. We have food, but only part of it has been cooked,\" said Oleksii as he watched the battery life on his mobile phone slip to 14%.\n\n>Another 500 people live in his block of flats, and when he went to his local \"invincibility centre\" to power up his phone, there were too many people with the same idea.\n\n>Another 150,000 people were left with no power in Zhytomyr, two hours' drive south of the Belarus border. The mayor said the next few weeks would be critical and rolling blackouts are looming for this city west of Kyiv.\n\n>\"We had three weeks without attacks and we had power,\" said Eugene Herasymchuk. \"And the power in the system allowed local authorities to start up the trolleybuses and trams. That was a big step because before that, public transport was on a pause.\"\nKyiv was also hit and one hospital treating 700 people went without heating and hot water for several hours. But for many Ukrainians, it was not long before they were back on the grid.\n\n>>\"It's safe to say that Ukraine won on the energy front,\" said Tetyana Boyko from civic network Opora, praising the fleet of energy workers and international help. \"Let's pray, but I think the worst-case scenario is over.\"\n\n>The winter may be over, but Oleksii believes the battle to save Ukraine's power supply from Vladimir Putin's missiles will continue as long as Russia has the ability to strike it.\n\n>Every one of Ukraine's thermal and hydroelectric power plants has been damaged since Russia launched its assault on the energy infrastructure last October. Kyiv had already lost the use of Europe's biggest nuclear power plant at Zaporizhzhia, which is in Russia hands.\nSub-stations have been reduced to hunks of twisted metal, no longer capable of transforming the electricity to power for homes and businesses.\n\n>For two weeks in the depth of winter, the BBC followed teams of engineers and technicians rushing to repair the damage that the missiles had done.\n\n>One substation had been hit six times with missiles or drones and replacing these damaged transformers will take time.\n\n>Transformers soon became Ukraine's number one requirement. It needed more than the world could produce in a year and so far only one high-voltage transformer has been sent, while dozens of lower-power machines have arrived.\n\n>As the winter wore on, Ukraine's armed forces grew more adept at shooting down Russia's missiles and drones.\nBut this week, only 34 of the missiles were destroyed, because Russia used different, high-speed weapons. They included hypersonic Kh-47 Kinzhal missiles as well as anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles.\n\n>\"They can cause huge, huge destruction,\" said one industry official.\nUntil Russia's full-scale war on Ukraine began in February 2022, there were 15 nuclear reactors on stream at four power stations. Six of those reactors were at Zaporizhzhia, seized by the occupying military in the early days of the invasion.\n\n>For months, the plant has been at the centre of a high-stakes nuclear row, amid accusations that Moscow wants to connect it to Russia's electricity grid.\n\n>The other three power stations are South Ukraine and Rivne and Khmelnytskyi in the west. Between them, they now produce half of Ukraine's power.\n\n>That may sound bleak, but a combination of an unusually mild winter and sheer hard work means Ukraine has moved back from the brink and the sense of optimism is palpable.\n\n>Power plants have been restored and repaired. One source in the industry told the BBC that as the days became sunnier and warmer, it would become harder and harder for Russia's military might to terrorise his country.\n\n>The east-central city of Dnipro has endured several deadly missile strikes over the winter, and this week was no different.\nBut there have been no problems for weeks with energy supplies.\n\n>\u201dThe city has transformed. Finally, street lights are back, and it's no longer scary to walk the city streets,\" said Inna Shtanko, a young mother with a son under the age of two.\n\n>Cooking and having a hot shower have become part of the daily routine once more for her family. \"Our psychological state has improved considerably, because our family and other mothers too can easily plan our day.\"\n\n>There's a similar story in Kherson, occupied by Russian forces until they retreated across the Dnipro river last November.\nLife was hard for several weeks after the Russians left the southern city with no basic utilities.\n\n>\"We didn't have any electricity for about month and a week, then we had it for two hours a day, then gradually it stopped breaking,\" said local entrepreneur Alexei Sandakov.\n\n>Now he boasts a regular power supply, although the pressure on the system is far lower than before the war because the population of 55,000 is a fraction of what it was before the Russians invaded.\nPopulation numbers have fallen across Ukraine, with more than eight million refugees beyond its borders, and that too has put less strain on the energy infrastructure. Consumption is down and the refugees have not yet come back, as one official remarked.\n\n>The overall sense is that the damage caused by this latest wave of missiles will be repaired quickly.\n\n>There was considerable damage, but engineers have become highly skilled at restoring power within days, even after a major attack.\n\n>\"It's like a competition: how quickly can they cause us damage and how quickly can we repair. And we are winning that competition,\" said Oleksandr Kharchenko, director of Kyiv's Energy Industry Research Centre.\n\n>In Zhytomyr, Eugene Herasymchuk believes things are looking up. \"A lot of Ukrainians say it's better to have one cold and one dark winter than 100 years with Russia - so I think we can handle this.\"\nUkrainians now have everything on their side, according to Mr Kharchenko, from the improving weather to the support of international donors and the professional of staff in the energy industry.

The nights are still cold, but they are emerging from a winter of Russian missile strikes that have cut their power, heating and their water too.\nThe winter was very hard but it was now over, declared President Volodymyr Zelensky. Ukraine still had heat and the country was unbreakable, was the message.</p>\n\n<p>Until Thursday, Ukraine had just gone for more than three weeks in a row with no blackouts and and even had surplus in the system.</p>\n\n<p>There had been no Russian attacks for three weeks either, and it looked as if Vladimir Putin&#39;s battle to bring down Ukraine&#39;s supply was over.\n&quot;Yes, we&#39;re doing it, but who started it?&quot; he said in December, pinning the blame on Kyiv.</p>\n\n<p>It was a far more desperate story at that point. As much as half the energy infrastructure was damaged and a Ukrainian nuclear security expert warned the situation was close to critical.</p>\n\n<p>But during those weeks of quiet, Russia had been stocking up weaponry. In the early hours of Thursday it fired 81 missiles and left four regions grappling with emergency power cuts. By Friday, half a million people still had no power in Kharkiv, Ukraine&#39;s second-biggest city.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s totally cold now. We have food, but only part of it has been cooked,&quot; said Oleksii as he watched the battery life on his mobile phone slip to 14%.</p>\n\n<p>Another 500 people live in his block of flats, and when he went to his local &quot;invincibility centre&quot; to power up his phone, there were too many people with the same idea.</p>\n\n<p>Another 150,000 people were left with no power in Zhytomyr, two hours&#39; drive south of the Belarus border. The mayor said the next few weeks would be critical and rolling blackouts are looming for this city west of Kyiv.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We had three weeks without attacks and we had power,&quot; said Eugene Herasymchuk. &quot;And the power in the system allowed local authorities to start up the trolleybuses and trams. That was a big step because before that, public transport was on a pause.&quot;\nKyiv was also hit and one hospital treating 700 people went without heating and hot water for several hours. But for many Ukrainians, it was not long before they were back on the grid.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s safe to say that Ukraine won on the energy front,&quot; said Tetyana Boyko from civic network Opora, praising the fleet of energy workers and international help. &quot;Let&#39;s pray, but I think the worst-case scenario is over.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The winter may be over, but Oleksii believes the battle to save Ukraine&#39;s power supply from Vladimir Putin&#39;s missiles will continue as long as Russia has the ability to strike it.</p>\n\n<p>Every one of Ukraine&#39;s thermal and hydroelectric power plants has been damaged since Russia launched its assault on the energy infrastructure last October. Kyiv had already lost the use of Europe&#39;s biggest nuclear power plant at Zaporizhzhia, which is in Russia hands.\nSub-stations have been reduced to hunks of twisted metal, no longer capable of transforming the electricity to power for homes and businesses.</p>\n\n<p>For two weeks in the depth of winter, the BBC followed teams of engineers and technicians rushing to repair the damage that the missiles had done.</p>\n\n<p>One substation had been hit six times with missiles or drones and replacing these damaged transformers will take time.</p>\n\n<p>Transformers soon became Ukraine&#39;s number one requirement. It needed more than the world could produce in a year and so far only one high-voltage transformer has been sent, while dozens of lower-power machines have arrived.</p>\n\n<p>As the winter wore on, Ukraine&#39;s armed forces grew more adept at shooting down Russia&#39;s missiles and drones.\nBut this week, only 34 of the missiles were destroyed, because Russia used different, high-speed weapons. They included hypersonic Kh-47 Kinzhal missiles as well as anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;They can cause huge, huge destruction,&quot; said one industry official.\nUntil Russia&#39;s full-scale war on Ukraine began in February 2022, there were 15 nuclear reactors on stream at four power stations. Six of those reactors were at Zaporizhzhia, seized by the occupying military in the early days of the invasion.</p>\n\n<p>For months, the plant has been at the centre of a high-stakes nuclear row, amid accusations that Moscow wants to connect it to Russia&#39;s electricity grid.</p>\n\n<p>The other three power stations are South Ukraine and Rivne and Khmelnytskyi in the west. Between them, they now produce half of Ukraine&#39;s power.</p>\n\n<p>That may sound bleak, but a combination of an unusually mild winter and sheer hard work means Ukraine has moved back from the brink and the sense of optimism is palpable.</p>\n\n<p>Power plants have been restored and repaired. One source in the industry told the BBC that as the days became sunnier and warmer, it would become harder and harder for Russia&#39;s military might to terrorise his country.</p>\n\n<p>The east-central city of Dnipro has endured several deadly missile strikes over the winter, and this week was no different.\nBut there have been no problems for weeks with energy supplies.</p>\n\n<p>\u201dThe city has transformed. Finally, street lights are back, and it&#39;s no longer scary to walk the city streets,&quot; said Inna Shtanko, a young mother with a son under the age of two.</p>\n\n<p>Cooking and having a hot shower have become part of the daily routine once more for her family. &quot;Our psychological state has improved considerably, because our family and other mothers too can easily plan our day.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s a similar story in Kherson, occupied by Russian forces until they retreated across the Dnipro river last November.\nLife was hard for several weeks after the Russians left the southern city with no basic utilities.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We didn&#39;t have any electricity for about month and a week, then we had it for two hours a day, then gradually it stopped breaking,&quot; said local entrepreneur Alexei Sandakov.</p>\n\n<p>Now he boasts a regular power supply, although the pressure on the system is far lower than before the war because the population of 55,000 is a fraction of what it was before the Russians invaded.\nPopulation numbers have fallen across Ukraine, with more than eight million refugees beyond its borders, and that too has put less strain on the energy infrastructure. Consumption is down and the refugees have not yet come back, as one official remarked.</p>\n\n<p>The overall sense is that the damage caused by this latest wave of missiles will be repaired quickly.</p>\n\n<p>There was considerable damage, but engineers have become highly skilled at restoring power within days, even after a major attack.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;It&#39;s like a competition: how quickly can they cause us damage and how quickly can we repair. And we are winning that competition,&quot; said Oleksandr Kharchenko, director of Kyiv&#39;s Energy Industry Research Centre.</p>\n\n<p>In Zhytomyr, Eugene Herasymchuk believes things are looking up. &quot;A lot of Ukrainians say it&#39;s better to have one cold and one dark winter than 100 years with Russia - so I think we can handle this.&quot;\nUkrainians now have everything on their side, according to Mr Kharchenko, from the improving weather to the support of international donors and the professional of staff in the energy industry. But he is more guarded about the future.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I don&#39;t say we&#39;ve won the energy war, but I can say we won the energy battle this winter.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

And currently there are Russian Mobiks serving under the LDNR units that are complaining of being used that way too, a expendable \"meat.\"\n\nOver the last spring to summer, the Russians used mounted motor rifle and tank probing attacks on the regular doing the same thing, they just didn't dismount much due to a lack of dismounts plus a mounted focus doctrine.\n\nAnd it isn't surprising, it's called \"reconnaissance in force\", \u0420\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0434\u043a\u0430 \u0411\u043e\u0435\u043c, and it's their doctrine. If they don't know where something is in order to destroy it with fires, they need to send units on an attack to find it. It's an extremely dangerous mission so if they need to do it repeatedly they either wear down all their maneuver units equally or they find expendable forces.\n\nThat said, it doesn't need to be as bloody as Wagner. What sets Wagner excon meat apart is the level of discipline and ruthlessness to keep them advancing, specifically the summary executions if they retreat without orders. They don't stop just because they found the enemy by drawing fire, they are required to keep pressing the attack and then digging in where they're officially stopped, and resisting counterattacks, which makes for a lot of very dangerous tasks to give barely trained troops. Luckily nobody gives a crap about them, so they can crank up discipline to WW2 era penal battalion standards. \n\n>With regular Russian army units now attacking Bakhmut, rather than convicts being sent to their death en masse, could this be a reason for Russia's current failure to take Bakhmut? Perhaps, even a reason why the tide could turn in Ukraine's favor?\n\nThe Russians aren't failing, their process just isn't that rapid. Which is understandable, they're not winning by human wave assaults, no matter the propaganda, or even heavily relying on assaults. They're using fires centric tactics to significantly weaken the defenders, with probing attacks with find and test defenses, and better assault units to try to press them out, open up flanks, etc. \n\nAnd they're still making progress.\n\n[Defmon3 showing progress of the last couple days](https://mobile.twitter.com/DefMon3/status/1634253546010087424)\n\n[two weeks ago](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FpwiOz_aIAAP_iD?format=jpg&name=large)\n\nOn top of that, the last couple weeks have supposedly been mud mud mud.

I think policymakers and general public is taking it too lightly. Although we don't know how much of affect does climate change make, but Middle East is among the most affected regions in that regard.  The basis of society build on the stability of its population, providing basic like food, water, shelter, education etc... but what happen when drought prolong for several months, when the people don't have water to drink, crop failure lead to famine or people place become too hot to live? It will create a humanitarian crisis that is much severe and devastating than any war. It destabilize the region much further ( imagine you're short on resources and your neighbors are more plentiful, it doesn't help when you and that neighbors already hostile with each other). A cooperative relationship, or at least a platform to talk will help a lot to mitigate the affect of it when the time come\n\n\n\nUSA is shifting away from Middle East to focus on Asia-pacific to counter China, that mean the region is not on US foreign policy top priority list anymore and allies in the region will lost or reduce a lot of favors. In my country there's a saying \"sell relatives far away to buy neighbors next to you\". After all, US or China, is very far away, while Iran, iraq, jordan, SA, uae, Yemen, syria etc is in same region, as thousands years before it. Relying on foreign power far away (now they're caring less and less about you) to counter each other is not as good as getting along. A cooperative, strong Muslim world/ Middle East make it less exploitable by outside power while putting more weight on the table if either China or USA want to lure you to their side.\n\n\nOverall I think it's a sign that countries is preparing for a multipolar world when China -USA competition becomes more serious. As China is taking more proactive rather than reactive position on international issues, countries around the world taking more pragmatic stance, not too loyal too hostile/non negotiable to either side will get them more benefits as wether China or USA want these countries lean to their side, they better offer better deals than just speech or half assed measures",

Although lower than January levels, STS transfers of Russian crude of Cueta made up another 4.4 million, putting the European STS sites at 71% of the global total.\n\n>Yosu, on the southern coast of South Korea, saw some 5.8 million barrels transferred offshore in February, taking the total crude transfers to a record 19.5 million barrels that month, the data shows.\n\n>The rise in STS transfers coincides with the EU's sanctions on seaborne Russian crude imports, as well as a ban on bloc-based firms providing maritime services to any non-EU vessels transporting Russian oil in breach of the oil price cap, which is Dec. 5 for crude and Feb. 5 for oil products. Brussels has also banned Russia-flagged ships from entering EU ports.\n\n>Although a common and not necessarily illicit part of the maritime oil trade, STS activity has been part of the sanctions-dodging playbook for Iran and Venezuela for years as a way of concealing the final destination of oil cargos.\n\nhttps://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/pt/market-insights/latest-news/oil/030823-tanker-switching-for-russian-oil-hits-record-high-as-sanctions-kick-in",
