        "body": "Here is something I just learned. Ukraine military discipline, which has been problematic, was lackluster because commanders had almost no power to enforce it, up until a week ago:\n\n[Why Ukraine\u2019s Top General Urges Tougher Punishment for Deserters](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/5970)\n\nSynopsis:\n\n- Zaluzhnyi proposed new legislation, Bill No. 8271, to expand UAF judicial powers to impose legit punishments, to include upwards of 12 years in prison for maximum penalties for certain crimes, and no civilian court oversight or appeals\n\n- Previous, for outright desertion in the face of the enemy, let alone other lesser infractions, the most they could do was fine them up to 10% of their pay: \n\n>Zaluzhny said that under the present rules, any Ukrainian soldier can, if he wishes, flee an assigned position or defy his commander and face little more than a 10 percent deduction from his military salary\n\n>'[Zelensky] made no public comment on the recent unsanctioned retreats by Ukrainian troops in some sectors, which Zaluzhny criticized, nor on bill No. 8271 or the general\u2019s call on Dec. 18 for tougher discipline, particularly regarding front line soldiers.'\n\n[it passed, was signed into law by Zelensky on 1/24](https://itd.rada.gov.ua/billInfo/Bills/Card/40997?fbclid=IwAR3N6bb4MI6kq69u08phUlJAx-0pAcvTZdfeO_g9FOH8ZVkxJDT5EF-Cz1s)\n\nThe bill was proposed in mid December, so it was thought out in November or early December. I wonder if any one event spurned it? \n\nEither way, this is good news. As Zaluzhnyi said, *\"An army is built on discipline\"* and that is 100% true. Without leadership being able to enforce discipline through an effective judicial system then true military discipline isn't possible. Ukrainians might have high motivated at times but that only lasts until the conditions exist until they don't, military discipline and professionalism  is what carries the day after that. \n\nThis part is funny:\n\n>Yury Butusov, one of Ukraine\u2019s highest profile military correspondents, and a longtime outspoken supporter of Zaluzhny personally, in a Dec. 20 Facebook post echoed that point of view, saying that **any commander thinking troops on the line will fight better if they are threatened with punitive jail sentences, has little understanding on why Ukrainian combat units fight and how to maintain their morale**\n\nThey'll fight better because they'll actually *still be there*, whereas without actual military discipline they could desert at will without real repercussions.",

Ukraine military discipline, which has been problematic, was lackluster because commanders had almost no power to enforce it, up until a week ago:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kyivpost.com/post/5970\">Why Ukraine\u2019s Top General Urges Tougher Punishment for Deserters</a></p>\n\n<p>Synopsis:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Zaluzhnyi proposed new legislation, Bill No. 8271, to expand UAF judicial powers to impose legit punishments, to include upwards of 12 years in prison for maximum penalties for certain crimes, and no civilian court oversight or appeals</p></li>\n<li><p>Previous, for outright desertion in the face of the enemy, let alone other lesser infractions, the most they could do was fine them up to 10% of their pay: </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Zaluzhny said that under the present rules, any Ukrainian soldier can, if he wishes, flee an assigned position or defy his commander and face little more than a 10 percent deduction from his military salary</p>\n\n<p>&#39;[Zelensky] made no public comment on the recent unsanctioned retreats by Ukrainian troops in some sectors, which Zaluzhny criticized, nor on bill No. 8271 or the general\u2019s call on Dec. 18 for tougher discipline, particularly regarding front line soldiers.&#39;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://itd.rada.gov.ua/billInfo/Bills/Card/40997?fbclid=IwAR3N6bb4MI6kq69u08phUlJAx-0pAcvTZdfeO_g9FOH8ZVkxJDT5EF-Cz1s\">it passed, was signed into law by Zelensky on 1/24</a></p>\n\n<p>The bill was proposed in mid December, so it was thought out in November or early December. I wonder if any one event spurned it? </p>\n\n<p>Either way, this is good news. As Zaluzhnyi said, <em>&quot;An army is built on discipline&quot;</em> and that is 100% true. Without leadership being able to enforce discipline through an effective judicial system then true military discipline isn&#39;t possible. Ukrainians might have high motivated at times but that only lasts until the conditions exist until they don&#39;t, military discipline and professionalism  is what carries the day after that. </p>\n\n<p>This part is funny:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yury Butusov, one of Ukraine\u2019s highest profile military correspondents, and a longtime outspoken supporter of Zaluzhny personally, in a Dec. 20 Facebook post echoed that point of view, saying that <strong>any commander thinking troops on the line will fight better if they are threatened with punitive jail sentences, has little understanding on why Ukrainian combat units fight and how to maintain their morale</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They&#39;ll fight better because they&#39;ll actually <em>still be there</em>, whereas without actual military discipline they could desert at will without real repercussions.</p>\n</div>",

Yellen declined to say specifically whether those proposals were acceptable to the US.\n\n>A US-led coalition of countries that includes Group of Seven nations and the EU imposed a set of restrictions on Russian crude oil on Dec. 5 that works in conjunction with the bloc\u2019s sanctions. Those ban most imports of seagoing Russian crude and prohibit EU companies from providing their services to cargoes of Russian crude shipped anywhere in the world, unless they are priced under a $60 per-barrel cap.\n\n>The restriction appears to have helped depress Moscow\u2019s revenue from crude sales while keeping Russian supplies on the global market.\n\n>The group plans to extend that program to two groups of refined Russian oil products on Feb. 5, but are yet to agree to the price limits. \n\n>The $100-a-barrel cap would apply to products like diesel that trade at a premium to crude, according to people familiar with the matter. A lower $45 threshold would be set for discounted ones like fuel oil, the people added. The figures could still change during talks between member states.\n\n\nJust to explain this further, the EU plans on banning diesel imports from Russia, much like they did with crude oil imports in December. The problem for Russia, however, is that the market for sea-borne diesel and the ships that can carry the supply, are very much more EU controlled than crude oil, where they have a shadow fleet to attempt to get around the caps. The $100 price cap on diesel represents a ~30% discount to benchmark prices. The problem for the EU is that they are short diesel and will now have to import more from the GCC and U.S. This ban/cap could have a much bigger impact on both parties than the crude ban. The good news for Europe is that the massive drop in nat gas prices has freed them more financially, and global LNG exports are going to hit a record this year.",

        "body": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/26/world/asia/china-protests-arrests.html\n\n> In China\u2019s Crackdown on Protesters, a Familiar Effort to Blame Foreign Powers\n\n> The protests against ''zero Covid'' were a rare rebuke of Xi Jinping's rule, and Beijing apparently seeks to deter those who might have been emboldened by them.\n\n> First, the accountant and the freelance writer were taken away. Then, the former tutor with a degree in English literature. And several days later, the police came for the editor at the Beijing publishing house.\n\n> The four detained women were friends. They spent their free time in China's capital as many curious, creative-minded young people did: hosting book clubs, watching movies, discussing social issues like feminism and L.G.B.T.Q. rights over barbecue. When protests against coronavirus restrictions broke out in November across China, including in Beijing, they attended. And now, they are among the first people known to have been formally arrested in connection with those protests.\n\n> China is waging a campaign of intimidation against people who joined the demonstrations, which were the boldest challenge to the Communist Party's rule in decades and an embarrassing affront to its leader, Xi Jinping.\n\n> The party seems determined to warn off anyone who may have been emboldened by the remarkable outburst of public discontent, which was followed just days later by Beijing's abrupt decision to abandon Covid restrictions. Since then, domestic challenges have mounted: Youth unemployment is high, the economy is slowing, and Covid infections and deaths have accelerated.\n\n> The authorities have not officially announced the arrests and have largely avoided even acknowledging the protests. In seeking to tamp down unrest without further inflaming public anger, the party has often favored discreet repression.\n\n> But news about the arrests -- as well as the interrogations and detentions of many other protesters -- has circulated widely among those who attended the demonstrations, or who cheered them on as hope for a rebirth of civil society. For many, the crackdown is a fresh reminder of the authorities' intolerance for even peaceful dissent, and of the personal risks that come with testing Beijing.\n\n> The party is also working to discredit the protesters by casting them as tools of malevolent foreign powers. Beijing has long dismissed dissent at home -- from calls for women's rights to pro-democracy activism to ethnic unrest -- as the result of Western-backed subversion. The protests against ''zero Covid'' were no exception: One Chinese diplomat suggested that some of the demonstrators had been ''bought by external forces.''\n\n> The New York Times spoke with several people familiar with the cases of the four women who have been arrested. They requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation, to provide details about the women's arrests and interrogations. The people have been closely tracking the women's cases, including from weeks earlier when the police began questioning them. They were either in touch with them before their arrests or with people close to them since they disappeared.\n\n> The police have asked the women about their use of overseas messaging platforms or involvement in feminist activities, such as reading groups, according to the people. Chinese propaganda has decried feminism as another tool of foreign influence.\n\n> The women, for their part, have said they were driven by their own convictions and a belief that they had a right, even in China, to voice them. Before she was detained in December, one of the women, Cao Zhixin, the editor, recorded a video that she entrusted to friends to share if she went missing.\n\n> ''We care about this society,'' said Ms. Cao, 26, in the video, in which she said that the other three women -- Li Yuanjing, the accountant; Li Siqi, 27, the freelance writer; and Zhai Dengrui, the former literature student -- had already been taken away.\n\n> ''At the scene, we respected public order, we didn't provoke any conflicts with the police,'' Ms. Cao continued. ''So why do you still have to secretly take us away?''\n\n> It is far from clear that the four women were targeted because of their interest in feminism. Other protesters may have also been arrested. Some Chinese social media users have tried to publicize the names of people missing since the protests, with various crowdsourced lists naming around two dozen people.\n\n> But the legal system is opaque and social media is heavily censored, making a thorough accounting difficult. Under Chinese law, the police can detain people for more than a month without formally arresting them.\n\n> But even if the authorities had not initially singled the women out for their feminist activities, once they were under investigation, those activities could have made them a target, said Lu Pin, a Chinese feminist activist who now lives in the United States, having faced harassment at home.\n\n> ''The Chinese government has to look for an explanation that fits their logic, and they don't believe that people organize on their own, according to their own political feeling. There must be a 'black hand,''' Ms. Lu said. ''In China, feminism is the last active, visible social movement.''\n\n> The protest in Beijing on Nov. 27 began as a candlelight vigil for at least 10 people who died in an apartment fire in the far-western region of Xinjiang in November. Many Chinese believed that Covid restrictions had prevented the victims from escaping, though the government denied that.\n\n> The women had attended out of grief, Ms. Cao, the editor, said in her video.\n\n> ''We have legitimate emotions to express when our compatriots are killed, we are full of sympathy for those who lost their lives -- that is why we went,'' Ms. Cao said.\n\n> That night, the Beijing police were relatively restrained, even as the vigil turned into a street protest calling for an end to ''zero Covid'' and greater political freedoms. Officers filmed participants but did not aggressively detain people on site.\n\n> One official, witnessed by a Times reporter, told protesters that he also mourned for those who had died in the fire. Another reminded marchers, ''No one has touched you.''\n\n> But that soon changed. In the days afterward, people who had attended protests in Beijing and other cities described being summoned or visited at home by officers, who asked why they had gone to the demonstrations, and with whom. Some were told their phone location data had been used to track them down. China's ambassador to France, Lu Shaye, called the protesters pawns of ''foreign forces,'' then refused to give evidence for that when asked by reporters.\n\n> A similar theme may have emerged in the police interrogations of the four women, according to the people familiar with their cases.\n\n> The police asked about the women's book clubs, where they had read Chizuko Ueno, a prominent Japanese feminist scholar. They pointed to their use of Telegram, the messaging app, which is blocked in China without special software. At least some of the women had studied overseas.\n\n> The police have accused the women of ''picking quarrels and provoking trouble,'' the people familiar with the cases said -- a vague crime that the authorities often charge critics with to silence them. It is punishable by up to five years' imprisonment.\n\n> Reached by telephone, an official with the Beijing public security bureau said that no one would be available for comment until after the weeklong Lunar New Year holiday.\n\n> Ms. Lu, the feminist activist in the United States, said the police's evident focus on people who were not prominent organizers, or even apparently part of any larger group, underscored how the authorities had decimated civil society.\n\n> ''After all the repression, in the eyes of the police, these people have become the most threatening forces,'' she said.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/26/world/asia/china-protests-arrests.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/26/world/asia/china-protests-arrests.html</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In China\u2019s Crackdown on Protesters, a Familiar Effort to Blame Foreign Powers</p>\n\n<p>The protests against &#39;&#39;zero Covid&#39;&#39; were a rare rebuke of Xi Jinping&#39;s rule, and Beijing apparently seeks to deter those who might have been emboldened by them.</p>\n\n<p>First, the accountant and the freelance writer were taken away. Then, the former tutor with a degree in English literature. And several days later, the police came for the editor at the Beijing publishing house.</p>\n\n<p>The four detained women were friends. They spent their free time in China&#39;s capital as many curious, creative-minded young people did: hosting book clubs, watching movies, discussing social issues like feminism and L.G.B.T.Q. rights over barbecue. When protests against coronavirus restrictions broke out in November across China, including in Beijing, they attended. And now, they are among the first people known to have been formally arrested in connection with those protests.</p>\n\n<p>China is waging a campaign of intimidation against people who joined the demonstrations, which were the boldest challenge to the Communist Party&#39;s rule in decades and an embarrassing affront to its leader, Xi Jinping.</p>\n\n<p>The party seems determined to warn off anyone who may have been emboldened by the remarkable outburst of public discontent, which was followed just days later by Beijing&#39;s abrupt decision to abandon Covid restrictions. Since then, domestic challenges have mounted: Youth unemployment is high, the economy is slowing, and Covid infections and deaths have accelerated.</p>\n\n<p>The authorities have not officially announced the arrests and have largely avoided even acknowledging the protests. In seeking to tamp down unrest without further inflaming public anger, the party has often favored discreet repression.</p>\n\n<p>But news about the arrests -- as well as the interrogations and detentions of many other protesters -- has circulated widely among those who attended the demonstrations, or who cheered them on as hope for a rebirth of civil society. For many, the crackdown is a fresh reminder of the authorities&#39; intolerance for even peaceful dissent, and of the personal risks that come with testing Beijing.</p>\n\n<p>The party is also working to discredit the protesters by casting them as tools of malevolent foreign powers. Beijing has long dismissed dissent at home -- from calls for women&#39;s rights to pro-democracy activism to ethnic unrest -- as the result of Western-backed subversion. The protests against &#39;&#39;zero Covid&#39;&#39; were no exception: One Chinese diplomat suggested that some of the demonstrators had been &#39;&#39;bought by external forces.&#39;&#39;</p>\n\n<p>The New York Times spoke with several people familiar with the cases of the four women who have been arrested. They requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation, to provide details about the women&#39;s arrests and interrogations. The people have been closely tracking the women&#39;s cases, including from weeks earlier when the police began questioning them. They were either in touch with them before their arrests or with people close to them since they disappeared.</p>\n\n<p>The police have asked the women about their use of overseas messaging platforms or involvement in feminist activities, such as reading groups, according to the people. Chinese propaganda has decried feminism as another tool of foreign influence.</p>\n\n<p>The women, for their part, have said they were driven by their own convictions and a belief that they had a right, even in China, to voice them. Before she was detained in December, one of the women, Cao Zhixin, the editor, recorded a video that she entrusted to friends to share if she went missing.</p>\n\n<p>&#39;&#39;We care about this society,&#39;&#39; said Ms. Cao, 26, in the video, in which she said that the other three women -- Li Yuanjing, the accountant; Li Siqi, 27, the freelance writer; and Zhai Dengrui, the former literature student -- had already been taken away.</p>\n\n<p>&#39;&#39;At the scene, we respected public order, we didn&#39;t provoke any conflicts with the police,&#39;&#39; Ms. Cao continued. &#39;&#39;So why do you still have to secretly take us away?&#39;&#39;</p>\n\n<p>It is far from clear that the four women were targeted because of their interest in feminism. Other protesters may have also been arrested. Some Chinese social media users have tried to publicize the names of people missing since the protests, with various crowdsourced lists naming around two dozen people.</p>\n\n<p>But the legal system is opaque and social media is heavily censored, making a thorough accounting difficult. Under Chinese law, the police can detain people for more than a month without formally arresting them.</p>\n\n<p>But even if the authorities had not initially singled the women out for their feminist activities, once they were under investigation, those activities could have made them a target, said Lu Pin, a Chinese feminist activist who now lives in the United States, having faced harassment at home.</p>\n\n<p>&#39;&#39;The Chinese government has to look for an explanation that fits their logic, and they don&#39;t believe that people organize on their own, according to their own political feeling. There must be a &#39;black hand,&#39;&#39;&#39; Ms. Lu said. &#39;&#39;In China, feminism is the last active, visible social movement.&#39;&#39;</p>\n\n<p>The protest in Beijing on Nov. 27 began as a candlelight vigil for at least 10 people who died in an apartment fire in the far-western region of Xinjiang in November. Many Chinese believed that Covid restrictions had prevented the victims from escaping, though the government denied that.</p>\n\n<p>The women had attended out of grief, Ms. Cao, the editor, said in her video.</p>\n\n<p>&#39;&#39;We have legitimate emotions to express when our compatriots are killed, we are full of sympathy for those who lost their lives -- that is why we went,&#39;&#39; Ms. Cao said.</p>\n\n<p>That night, the Beijing police were relatively restrained, even as the vigil turned into a street protest calling for an end to &#39;&#39;zero Covid&#39;&#39; and greater political freedoms. Officers filmed participants but did not aggressively detain people on site.</p>\n\n<p>One official, witnessed by a Times reporter, told protesters that he also mourned for those who had died in the fire. Another reminded marchers, &#39;&#39;No one has touched you.&#39;&#39;</p>\n\n<p>But that soon changed. In the days afterward, people who had attended protests in Beijing and other cities described being summoned or visited at home by officers, who asked why they had gone to the demonstrations, and with whom. Some were told their phone location data had been used to track them down. China&#39;s ambassador to France, Lu Shaye, called the protesters pawns of &#39;&#39;foreign forces,&#39;&#39; then refused to give evidence for that when asked by reporters.</p>\n\n<p>A similar theme may have emerged in the police interrogations of the four women, according to the people familiar with their cases.</p>\n\n<p>The police asked about the women&#39;s book clubs, where they had read Chizuko Ueno, a prominent Japanese feminist scholar. They pointed to their use of Telegram, the messaging app, which is blocked in China without special software. At least some of the women had studied overseas.</p>\n\n<p>The police have accused the women of &#39;&#39;picking quarrels and provoking trouble,&#39;&#39; the people familiar with the cases said -- a vague crime that the authorities often charge critics with to silence them. It is punishable by up to five years&#39; imprisonment.</p>\n\n<p>Reached by telephone, an official with the Beijing public security bureau said that no one would be available for comment until after the weeklong Lunar New Year holiday.</p>\n\n<p>Ms. Lu, the feminist activist in the United States, said the police&#39;s evident focus on people who were not prominent organizers, or even apparently part of any larger group, underscored how the authorities had decimated civil society.</p>\n\n<p>&#39;&#39;After all the repression, in the eyes of the police, these people have become the most threatening forces,&#39;&#39; she said. &#39;&#39;These communities that normally would not be considered political -- people eating together, watching movies, talking about art -- at key times, these can have the potential for political activation.&#39;&#39;</p>\n\n<p>The authorities&#39; primary motivation in moving forward with the cases is probably not suppressing these women in particular, but more generally warning others who might have drawn inspiration from the demonstrations.</p>\n\n<p>While there have been no large-scale repeats of the politically charged protests late last year, sporadic demonstrations on more discrete issues have continued in recent weeks.

        "body": "On October 22, 2021, [Putin gave an extended address to the Valdai Club](https://valdaiclub.com/events/posts/articles/vladimir-putin-meets-with-members-of-the-valdai-discussion-club-transcript-of-the-18th-plenary-session/) that has many extremely interesting statements that illustrate his thinking about both the Ukraine and Europe. IMO, the most important comment regards Europe and energy policy:\n\n> Look what is happening. I believe I said at the meeting with the Government yesterday or the day before yesterday: this is not just about energy sources or gas, but also about the state of the global economy. Shortages are increasing in the leading, economically advanced countries. Take the United States, for one. It has recently made yet another decision to increase its national debt.\n> For those who do not deal with the economy, I can tell you what a decision to increase the national debt means. The FRS will print money and put it at the government\u2019s disposal. This is emission. The deficit is increasing, and inflation is increasing as an emission derivative. This leads to price increases on energy sources, on electricity. This is how it works, not the other way around.\n> However, the situation is also deteriorating due to realities in the energy market. What are these realities? You just spoke about Europe. What is going on in Europe? Maybe I will repeat some of my ideas or maybe I will say something new, if I recall it. In the past few years, the European Commission\u2019s philosophy was entirely devoted to regulating the market of energy sources, including gas, via a commodities exchange, through the so-called spot market. They tried to persuade us to give up long-term contracts where prices were tied to the exchange, that is, market quotes on crude oil and petroleum products.\n\n> Incidentally, this is market price formation. Since gas prices are established with a lag of six months after a change in oil prices, this is, firstly, a more stable situation and, secondly, a six-month lag allows consumers and suppliers to make adjustments along the way based on developments on world markets.\n\n> So, everything began to be brought to this spot market, but it largely holds gas on paper, not real gas. These are not physical amounts, which are not increasing (I will explain why in a minute). A figure is written on paper, but there is no physical amount, it is declining. So, a cold winter requires gas from underground storage; a wind-free hot summer means a lack of wind generation on the necessary scale. I have already mentioned the macroeconomic reasons, and these are the sector-based reasons.\n\n> What happened next on the European market? First, a decline in production in the gas producing countries. Production in Europe fell by 22.5 billion cubic metres during the first six months. This is first. Second, gas storage facilities were underfilled by 18.5 billion cubic metres and are only 71 percent full. The gas storage facilities were underfilled by 18.5 during the first six months of the year. If you look at annual consumption, this number must be doubled.\n\n> Primarily American, along with Middle Eastern companies withdrew 9 billion cubic metres from the European market and redirected the gas to Latin America and Asia. By the way, when the Europeans were formulating the principles governing the formation of the gas market in Europe, and said that all gas must be traded on the spot market, they were proceeding from the assumption that the European market is a premium market. But the European market is no longer a premium market, you see? It is no longer a premium market. Gas was redirected to Latin America and Asia.\n\n> I have already said that 18.5 billion cubic metres, plus double that amount, 9 billion (undersupplied to the European market from the United States and the Middle East), plus a decline in production of 22.5 billion \u2013 the deficit on the European market may amount to about 70 billion cubic metres, which is a lot. What does Russia have to do with it? This is the result of the European Commission\u2019s economic policy. Russia has nothing to do with it.\n\n> Russia, including Gazprom, has increased deliveries to the European market by 8.7 percent, I believe, and deliveries to non-CIS countries by 12 percent, I think. But when we speak about non-CIS countries, we mean China as well. This is also good for the international market, because we are increasing deliveries to the global market, and increased deliveries to the European market by 8.7. In absolute terms, this represents over 11 billion cubic metres of gas. American and Middle Eastern companies undersupplied by 9 billion, while Gazprom increased its supplies by more than 11 billion.\n\n> Can everyone hear me? Not in this audience, but the so-called stakeholders. Someone out there is cutting supplies to you, while we are increasing them.\n\nPutin conflates the US national debt limit with EU gas shortages (they went into the 2021-2022 winter with far fewer reserves). He also (correctly) forecasts that short-term western interests in 2021 would lead to significant inflation in 2022. I think this highlights why Putin decided to invade when he did - his perception of a profligate, self-centered west ignorant of the importance of energy policy meant they were over-leveraged and unable to meaningfully counter Russia. Simply put, he assumed Russia had far more soft power than it had through energy exports. The fact that he conflates the US debt with EU energy policy is fascinating. \n\nThe big takeaway is to highlight how the warmer than expected winter, proactive European plan to expand exports, and supply rations have dealt Russia a significant strategic defeat. Putin was aware of this, but it is notable he viewed this as risk to Europe and not Russia (e.g. hot summer and cold winter). Putin\u2019s energy share in Europe was multi-decadal geopolitical play that, to date, has failed spectacularly. A lot depended on how much of an outlier this (2022/2023) winter was, but if Europe can continue to expand LNG ports and outbid East Asia for delivery, then Putin not only failed, but fundamentally undermined Russia\u2019s long term economic and strategic position. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence we see the most consequential heavy weapons being supplied after energy security for Europe is established. It is also possible that China\u2019s COVID 0 policy softened demand in East Asia enough to allow Europe to gain a foothold in 2022 that was not available earlier. This was clearly something Putin was focused on.",

There are bids for LNG container ships to deliver, and in 2021 East Asian and Latin America were outbidding Europe consistently. He was attentive to the open LNG market and saw a pattern in which Europe was not effectively securing supply from other markets. This was because LNG was at the start more expensive than getting gas from Russia via Nordstream 1 and Ukraine (and ultimately Nordstream 2). As a result, EU leaders weren\u2019t adding a premium to an already expensive price to outbid Asia/Latin America. \n\nIn Putin\u2019s eyes, he had won the natural gas market in Europe (thus his last comment, \u201cSomeone out there is cutting supplies to you, while we are increasing them\u201d). I think this indicates he assumed he had attained his strategic objective of dominance over EU energy needs. This was obviously mistaken - Europe proved in 2022 that it could outbid Asia and Latin America and replace supply. I think Putin must have thought that the relationships being built among LNG container ships and purchasers were more durable than just \u201chighest bidder\u201d, per your free market comment. \n\nTBH its part for the course as far as Putin thinks. He is capable of setting a long-term plan and exercising extreme discipline to get there, his 20 year pursuit of the EU energy market is an example of that. He is attentive to market details at an extreme level. But his expertise in the subject has a big confirmation bias effect, and he starts to forecast in a self-flattering way. E.g. his assumption that the shipping LNG market had slipped away from Europe. Like meme stock trader, his interpretation of granular details of the global LNG market supported his gut instinct, and now like them he is getting margin called. \n\nI think China\u2019s COVID-0 policy handed Europe the win and Russia the L here. China recorded a nearly 20% decline in LNG deliveries in 2022 ([paywalled link](https://www.upstreamonline.com/lng/china-records-largest-decline-in-lng-imports-in-2022/2-1-1384070), sorry).  This demand weakness from China gave Europe the (to Putin) unforeseen opportunity to diversify in the short term. I highlight his 2021 comments to really drive him how the 2022/2023 winter has devastated his strategic planning.

Plus many want the UAF to expand too, take on a bigger role, which isn&#39;t a surprising argument when most of the noise from the west to gift the Ukrainians F16/Grippen is coming from NATO Air Power proponents who want their sacred service to perform a more meaningful role in winning the war.</p>\n</div>",

The people voting for the alt-right today are the people that were voting GOP during the gwot years. \n\nNow, during the run up to the 2000 elections Bush did say that he wasn't going to intervening all over the world and playing world cop like Clinton had done. I'm willing to say, for the sake of argument, that perhaps some people against intervention actually believed Bush and voted GOP for that reason. Seems unlikely given that Cheney was his running partner, but you know, I'll give the benefit of the doubt.\n\nBut any benefit of the doubt ends after 9/11. Because the US immediately intervened in Afghanistan and soon started talking up an intervention in Iraq. 2002 midterms were after Afghanistan but before Iraq and it was clear where this was going. Bush did not lose any support from his base, they backed him to the hilt; the GOP gained seats in 2002. \n\n*Therefore* every single GOP voter at that time is *personally* responsible for the Iraq war. They knew what was going to happen and they were 100% onboard. Then they reelected Bush, which *further* increases their personal responsibility for that war. \n\nIf current alt-right types are not happy with how that war went then they need to take a good long look in the mirror because if they are 40 or over then they are personally responsible for that war. If they view the war as a success then that is on them, and if they view it as a failure that is also on them.\n\nI don't criticize the people that supported the war back then and still do, my disdain is for overwhelming majority of GOP voters that are unhappy with how things went and won't admit they personally caused that to happen.

If they did, if they had some issue with intervention on principal, if they really believed in isolationism, then they would admit they were wrong, personalty wrong, to support the Iraq war back in the day. Which they don't, at most they might say blame \"the nation\" or \"the establishment\" in some sort of vague way, but never themselves. \n\nSo, what it really is, is that they like Putin's Russia for cultural and political reasons because in their minds it's some sort of authoritarian white christian utopia and they don't like that we're fighting a nation they admire so deeply. If in some bizzaro universe we were in a proxy war with the Scandinavia countries that had launched a unprovoked invasion of their neighbors, the US progressives would be finding every excuse in the world to oppose that war because they admire those countries.

The bullets don't travel very far from the impact point, even being aerodynamic and all. \n\n> let's say no debris existed due to some miracle of pressure\n\nIt's no miracle, fragments of concrete and surroundings literally get sucked by the water into the pipe. All the gas we saw on the surface for days had an equivalent volume of water being vacuumed into the pipe, moving everything around it. \n\n\n> the way the pipe would get deformed due to the explosion will still tell where the explosion came from\n\nI suggest you see [this footage](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/oct/18/nord-stream-1-first-underwater-images-reveal-devastating-damage). You can see a piece of the pipe bent outwards. It is still no guarantee it came from inside, as an explosion on the other side could have fractured the steel on that side, but only managed to bend it on the other side. \n\n> Third, the pipeline was not operational when the explosions occurred so there was no gas to escape.\n\nLOL. There was no flow but both were pressurized with gas. IIRC the first news about it was Russians noticing a pressure drop on their end.\n\nEven if there was no gas, what do you expect the pipes to be filled with? Salt water?",

They're making all of this 'complicated and hard' given the existing sanctions and are trying to drive a wedge between the allies, as of course the stolen aircraft are a huge loss and any money gotten back would be a plus.\n\n**Why is Russia offering a buyout when they're already stolen**? They have them already, they're not getting the parts even if they had managed to secure a buyout, so what do they gain by doing it?",
