        "body": "A few updates on the order of battle in Ukraine and on the frontline situation.\n\nThis morning the Ukrainian observer Mashovets wrote that the first elements of the new 44th Corps of the Leningrad Military District have just arrived along the state border in Kursk Oblast.\n\nAt the moment we are talking about one motorized battalion, one tank company and one artillery battery of the 128th Motorized Brigade; two motorized battalions, one tank battalion, the artillery group (tube, rocket and anti-aircraft defense) and minor support units of the 30th Motorized Regiment of the 72nd Motorized Division; and the 197th Separate Control Battalion. A total of 3650 men from this corps and 450 units of equipment were deployed, under the jurisdiction of the Group of Forces \"North\". I suppose their short-to-medium-term objective is to cover the border. The GoF \"North\" thus exceeds 50 thousand men, a significant part of whom are conscripts, however - which makes me bearish about the possibility of offensive operations from the state border (Mashovets had estimated that an operation against Kharkiv would need the forces of an entire military district, thus at least 2/3 CAAs, and let's remember that conscripts are not used for combat tasks on the Ukrainian territory). \n\nLet's recall that this corps is officially based between Leningrad Oblast and Karelia and includes the division and the brigade mentioned above + an artillery brigade, a rocket brigade and separate support units. The commander is, reportedly, Alexander Dembitsky, until now the deputy commander of the 1st GTA. It's not clear to which CAA it belongs, possibly the 6th CAA.\n\nAnother very interesting thing reported by Mashovets is that an air assault battalion belonging to the 76th VDV Division (equipped with 22 BMD-2/4s, 11 BTR-MDs and 4 2S9 Nonas) has been transferred from the Orikhiv sector (where the whole division is deployed) to the Luhansk Oblast. With the aim of joining either the GoF \u201cWest\u201d or the GoF \u201cSouth\u201d. At the moment there are no other details, but I personally consider it likely that the Russians intend to transfer the 76th VDV Division to the Bakhmut sector (let's remember that Popasna is the main staging area for operations in this area), to use it as a second echelon for operations in the western bank of the Donets-Donbas Canal, around Chasiv Yar. After all, the 98th VDV Division has been directly involved in offensive operations in the direction of Chasiv Yar for 6 months now. This also confirms that the Orikhiv sector is a front of secondary importance to the Russians, having pushed the Ukrainians away from the heights between Novoprokopivka and Verbove, despite recent Russian tactical successes inside Robotyne. This was, however, to be expected after the dismantling of the GoF \u201cZaporizhzhia\u201d in February, which was largely merged into the GoF \u201cDnepr\u201d and to a lesser extent into the GoF \"Vostok\".\n\nLastly, Mashovets wrote that 43 Russian fighter aircrafts and fighter-bombers were transferred from air bases near Ukraine (in Crimea, Voronezh and Rostov Oblasts and Krasnodar Krai) to more distant air bases (in Stavropol Krai, Astrakhan and Lipetsk Oblasts), due to fear of Ukrainian attacks. As a result, the grouping of Russian combat, special and military transport aircrafts located near the area of hostilities dropped from 303 to 280 units.\n\nhttps://t. me/zvizdecmanhustu/1829\n\nMoreover, the day before yesterday an assault group of the 11th VDV Brigade reached the Donets-Donbas Canal, in the area where it passes underground and in overground pipes, i.e. in the forest of the nature reserve south of the Kanal District of Chasiv Yar. This is not surprising at all: Russian forward positions were already near the canal as early as mid-April, and in any case it's not clear whether the Russians have consolidated the gains along the canal. The 18th \u201cSloviansk\u201d Brigade of the Ukrainian National Guard (which arrived from the Kreminna sector) was recently transferred to this area. It's a very delicate area and it will be crucial to prevent the Russians from gaining positions in the western bank. The 98th VDV Division continues to try to infiltrate the Kanal District, without success at the moment, however.\n\nhttps://t. me/creamy_caprice/5308\n\nThe eleventh brigade of Ukraine's Offensive Guard was very recently [created](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2024/04/30/7453600/): the \u201cHart\u201d Brigade, belonging to the State Border Guard Service, presumably raised on the basis of a detachment of Border Guards already active at the front. On April 24, the Verkhovna Rada approved an expansion of the manpower of the Border Guards, from 60 to 75 thousand servicemen.\n\nAs for the Ukrainian National Guard, MilitaryLand [reports](https://militaryland.net/news/national-guard-forms-an-artillery-brigade/) that the 16th Brigade, officially created in October, turned out to be an artillery brigade (the first such unit in the NG), receiving a batch of 2S22 Bohdanas. Within two months Ukraine went from producing 6 to 10 units per month of such SPG, and by the end of the year some Ukrainian analysts hope it will reach a production volume of 20 units per month. \n\nWith the transfer of the 100th Mechanized Brigade (formerly the 100th TDF Brigade) to the Avdiivka sector from the Serebrianka Forest, the latter place became basically entirely the responsibility of the National Guard (though still under the OTG \u201cLyman\u201d, of course). Here the \"Azov\", \"Bureviy\" and \"Khartiia\" Brigades and other smaller NG units are deployed. And indeed last week Oleksandr Pivnenko, the commander of the NG, visited his men's positions in the Kreminna sector. The transfer of the 100th Mechanized Brigade (which had been holding the area near Dibrova for a year) has somewhat weakened the Ukrainians in that area, and the 164th Motorized Brigade of the 25th CAA has managed to gain a couple of Ukrainian squad-positions to the south of Dibrova, but we are talking about minor stuff. But in general the Serebrianka Forest was used as a pool from which to gather units to reinforce other sectors, especially by the Russians: during the fall and especially the winter the 90th Tank Division was entirely moved to Avdiivka from there, followed by the 137th Motorized Brigade of the 41st CAA. To reinforce their grouping in the Serebrianka Forest (consisting of the 169th Motorized Brigade of the 25th CAA, elements of the 201st Military Base of the Central MD and \u201cAkhmat\u201d detachments), elements of the 67th Motorized Division of the 25th CAA recently arrived, to which the 1234th Regiment of the Territorial Forces (mobilized men from Tatarstan) was attached.

            "body": "In the Avdiivka sector there are still no signs of stabilization. The most worrying section is the one between Novooleksandrivka and Arkhanhelske, which is the one with the least Ukrainian fortifications, by the way. The Russians (30th Motorized Brigade of the 2nd CAA, which is continuously resupplied with men and gear) are advancing northwards in this direction, to the east of Novooleksandrivka, according to DeepState. It's clear that the Russians' main objective is to get as close as possible to Highway T0504 (Pokrovsk-Kostiantynivka-Bakhmut) in the direction of Nova Poltavka. The Ukrainian 115th Mechanized Brigade is active here, supported by several territorial defense battalions. Today Ukrainian channels have begun advising civilians against using this highway (the Russians are quite far from having direct fire control anyway, mind you). \n\nhttps://t. me/stanislav_osman/5814\n\nBetween the day before yesterday and yesterday the Russians (132nd Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps) occupied all of Keramik and Novokalynove, taking positions north of the former village, while the 35th Motorized Brigade of the 41st CAA seized Hill 232, halfway between the latter village and Ocheteryne. The 115th Mechanized Brigade, elements of the 23rd Mechanized Brigade (including the 425th Assault Battalion \u201cSkala\u201d) and of the 142nd Infantry Brigade are active in this area. \n\nRussian sources (Motopatriot, by far among the most decent ones) report they took control of the southern part of Arkhanhelske (there is no evidence to confirm this) and that they're attacking Ukrainian strongpoints to the west of the village. Extremely fierce Ukrainian resistance is also reported over the control of the forest belt north of Ocheretyne, to avoid the potential flanking of Arkhanhelske. \n\nhttps://t. me/motopatriot/22358\n\nFor the Ukrainian observer Myroshnykov, the Russians have begun to become active towards Oleskandropil (the village east of the H20 Highway), without success; for Mashovets it's possible that the Russians in the future will shift their attentions in order to advance as far as possible along this highway to reach the Stara Mykolaivka - Sukha Balka line (where Ukrainian fortifications are present), as part of the development of the southern flank of a potential offensive operation against Toretsk.\n\nThe Russians (433rd Motorized Regiment of the 27th Motorized Division of the 2nd CAA) over the last days have approached an Ukrainian trench system south of Novooleksandrivka in the direction of Prohres, which is the forward outpost of the defense line that passes along the Vovcha River to the south (I recommend reading this [thread](https://x.com/clement_molin/status/1785595505306698020) by Cl\u00e9ment Molin). The 100th Mechanized Brigade is active in this area. \n\nThe situation, overall, is very difficult: for Mashovets the Russians have a 3/4 fold advantage regarding gear and a 6 (!) fold advantage regarding manpower over the Ukrainians, as well as three reserve rifle regiments in the area (which I imagine are going to be used to replenish the units that are advancing) and he notes an exhaustion state for the Ukrainian grouping in this area. There is some arrival of reinforcements on the Ukrainian side, though. The spokesman of the OSG \"Khortytsia\" yesterday reported the 95th Air Assault Brigade as being active near Ocheretyne, so at least one battalion has been moved here (either from the Kreminna sector, where the bulk of the brigade is deployed, or it could be that battalion of the 95th Brigade that was previously committed near Pobjeda in the Marinka sector). Also, the \u201cAchilles\u201d UAV Battalion of the 92nd Assault Brigade has released videos showing itself in action around Ocheteryne. This brigade is one of the largest in the UAF and was so far deployed entirely in the Bakhmut sector. Perhaps, this could be an indication of a incoming redeployment of a maneuver battalion of the brigade in this area.\n\nMinor Russian units such as the \"Arbat\" Battalion, the \u201cMaksym Krivonos\u201d Detachment, and the former PMC \u201cYastreb\u201d are also active here. One thing I have noticed is that this offensive is, relatively, not-so-much mechanized and especially armored (while obviously the Russians are still heavily relying on IFVs/APCs to move), with infantry advancing along tree lines and without the massive armored attacks (and the following losses) that marked the advance of the 90th Tank Division in the direction of Umanske/Yasnobrodivka, back in the last month. Possibly that might be due to the fact that the endowment of armored vehicles of the GoF \"Centre\" is far from optimal, especially with regard to tanks, although it's about to receive the hundred BTR-82A(M)s which were previously deployed in Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\nToday a geolocation (of a video published by Syrsky) was released, showing Russian infantry (I assume from the 15th Motorized Brigade of the 2nd CAA) being shelled around 1,5 km west of the previous Russian positions in Soloviove, in the direction of Sokil, near a Ukrainian trench located halfway between the two villages. It's not clear at all even to Russian sources, however, whether the Russians have consolidated control over this trench and how far they have actually advanced towards Sokil.\n\nhttps://t. me/EjShahidenko/2557\n\nhttps://t. me/motopatriot/22334\n\nhttps://t. me/motopatriot/22373\n\nIn Soloviove, the 55th Mountain Brigade of the 41st CAA is moving along the Balka Ocheretina (a small stream, tributary of the Vovcha) in the direction of Novopokrovske; the 74th Motorized Brigade of the 41st CAA is attempting to occupy the forest belts to the west of Berdychi in the same direction, in both cases recording advances but finding strong opposition by the 47th Mechanized Brigade and its Bradleys, supported by elements of the 144th Infantry Brigade and several territorial defense battalions. \n\nThe 114th Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps is being (yet again) replenished and in the next few days they could move to advance to the west of Semenivka, against the positions of the 68th Jager Brigade. In addition, the Russians have occupied the part of Orlivka in the western bank of the Durna.",

It&#39;s not clear at all even to Russian sources, however, whether the Russians have consolidated control over this trench and how far they have actually advanced towards Sokil.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a>. me/EjShahidenko/2557</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a>. me/motopatriot/22334</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a>. me/motopatriot/22373</p>\n\n<p>In Soloviove, the 55th Mountain Brigade of the 41st CAA is moving along the Balka Ocheretina (a small stream, tributary of the Vovcha) in the direction of Novopokrovske; the 74th Motorized Brigade of the 41st CAA is attempting to occupy the forest belts to the west of Berdychi in the same direction, in both cases recording advances but finding strong opposition by the 47th Mechanized Brigade and its Bradleys, supported by elements of the 144th Infantry Brigade and several territorial defense battalions. </p>\n\n<p>The 114th Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps is being (yet again) replenished and in the next few days they could move to advance to the west of Semenivka, against the positions of the 68th Jager Brigade. In addition, the Russians have occupied the part of Orlivka in the western bank of the Durna.</p>\n</div>",

The ensuing competition is often remembered as among the hardest fought and most technically demanding, culminating in arguably the single greatest capability leap between fighter generations to date. However, the competing Lockheed-Boeing-General Dynamics F-22 and Northrop-McDonnell Douglas F-23 represented more than dueling design philosophies. They reflected each company\u2019s key individuals\u2014and to an extent, corporate cultures\u2014in gauging what the customer really wanted.\n\nMaking the Cut\nThe Air Force spent the first four months of 1991 closely examining all four airframe-engine combinations for the engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) phase. The ATF source selection was a three-stage process involving the Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB), Source Selection Advisory Council (SSAC) and Source Selection Authority (SSA). The SSEB evaluated contractor proposals relative to the request for proposals (RFP).\n\nThe RFP placed the greatest importance on equally rated contractor technical performance and program management, followed by cost. Bill Sweetman, who later became an AW&ST senior defense editor, reported in aerospace magazine Interavia in May 1991 that evaluators used a series of \u201cstoplight charts\u201d to grade contractor proposals, with blue indicating superior performance relative to the requirement, green as meeting the requirement, yellow as being below required performance but fixable and red as seriously deficient in performance. Under these conditions, the Air Force appeared to have weighted deficient performance more heavily than excess performance. \n\nOnce the SSEB concluded its evaluation, the findings went to the SSAC, which typically compares the merits of each proposal and briefs the SSA. The ATF SSAC did not make specific recommendations to the SSA; then-Air Force Secretary Donald B. Rice made the final decision. On April 23, 1991, Rice announced the selection of the F-22/Pratt & Whitney F119 combination as the winner of the ATF competition.\n\nTwo distinct but interrelated narratives emerged from government and industry following the source selection announcement concerning why the choice was made. One focused on prime contractorship and the other on showmanship and the teams\u2019 understanding of the customer.\n\n\u201cPrime Contractorship\u201d\nAt the April 23 press conference, Rice explained that all of the proposals met Air Force requirements, and each of the four combinations was awardable. However, the Lockheed-Pratt & Whitney combination \u201cclearly offered better capability at lower cost, thereby providing the Air Force with true best value.\u201d Government sources maintain that the Lockheed team won on the merits of its program and project management plans rather than on technical performance.\n\nJust after the contract award, Aviation Week published a special report on the ATF selection in which an Air Force official familiar with the source selection process was paraphrased as saying: \u201cLockheed and Pratt were considered more likely to accomplish what they proposed and to manage the development program successfully. Northrop and GE were considered more likely to have problems\u201d (AW&ST April 29, 1991). The Lockheed-Pratt & Whitney aircraft\u2019s slightly lower cost also was significant, since \u201ca few percentage points in as high-cost a program as the advanced tactical fighter involve large amounts of money,\u201d the official was paraphrased as saying. \u201cIt was very clean,\u201d the official said of the decision. \u201cThere were not a lot of gut-wrenching judgment calls to be made.\u201d\n\nRice explained that the Air Force cross-referenced contractor ATF proposals with records of their past programs to judge the veracity of their proposals and their ability to manage risk and control costs. He declined to specify how much prior performance on external programs was weighed on ATF, but circumstantial evidence suggests it was a major contributing factor.\n\nThe Soviet Union was collapsing, and defense budgets were correspondingly slated to decline. For the ATF to survive, the Air Force was highly incentivized to choose the least risky and most affordable airframe-engine combination led by the prime with the strongest program management history. At the time, both Northrop and McDonnell Douglas were facing mounting pressure to deliver on their flagship programs. \n\nNorthrop\u2019s top pair of low-observable (LO), meaning radar stealth, programs\u2014the AGM-137 Tri-Service Standoff Attack Missile (TSSAM) and B-2A\u2014were experiencing substantial cost and schedule delays. TSSAM was canceled in 1994 with a projected unit cost of $2 million ($3.8 million in fiscal 2025 dollars). More alarmingly for Northrop, the B-2 was facing mounting congressional scrutiny. By 1988, the program was running 18-24 months behind schedule as a result of an Air Force-mandated redesign to improve low-altitude penetration characteristics and emerging signature performance issues. Rice frequently had to defend the program from both the media and Congress during this period.\n\nMeanwhile, Northrop\u2019s principal F-23 partner, McDonnell Douglas, was facing existential financial and legal liabilities along with General Dynamics following the termination for default of the Navy\u2019s A-12 program in January 1991. The A-12, a stealthy carrier-based bomber, was developed under a $4.8 billion ($10.8 billion in fiscal 2025 dollars), fixed-price EMD contract. By March 1990, the A-12 was likely over budget by $1 billion ($2.3 billion in fiscal 2025 dollars) and at least a year behind schedule.\n\nThen-Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told Congress on April 26, 1990, that the A-12 program \u201cappears to be reasonably well-handled at this point.\u201d As additional cost and schedule overruns became public, he canceled the program and alleged that he had been misled by the Navy and A-12 industry team. Subsequent analysis by James P. Stephenson and others concluded the Navy shared responsibility for a significant portion of the A-12\u2019s failures and sought to deflect blame to the General Dynamics-McDonnell Douglas team. However, at the time of the ATF source selection, the A-12 tarnished both the reputations and financial solvency of General Dynamics and McDonnell Douglas.\n\n\u201cThe A-12 helped us because nobody\u2019s buying on promises anymore,\u201d Sweetman quoted a Lockheed executive as saying. In contrast to the B-2 and A-12, Lockheed\u2019s F-117A Nighthawk performed beyond expectations between January and February 1991 during the Gulf War.\n\nLockheed\u2019s F-22A proposal also may have appeared lower-risk because it entailed fewer design changes from its YF-22. Lockheed\u2019s Navy Advanced Tactical Fighter (NATF) was more similar to its ATF offering as well, whereas Northrop\u2019s NATF featured an entirely different canard diamond wing planform.\n\nThe Navy canceled the NATF in its fiscal 1991 budget request, but Lockheed ATF Program Manager Sherman Mullin nevertheless credited the Navy\u2019s support as a contributing factor toward its ATF victory. \u201cThe Navy still got a vote in the ATF competition, and, as we found out later for certain, it casted for our F-22 team,\u201d he said. Mullin also cited Gen. (ret.) Alton D. Slay as having markedly improved Lockheed\u2019s technical proposals through a series of red team reviews. \u201cWe would have never won the tough ATF competition without the contributions of Slay and his team,\u201d Mullin said.",

                "body": "Part 2:\nMeasure of Merit\nIndustry teams perceived different nuances within the ATF concept of operations and took divergent paths with their designs. In reflecting on his nearly six-decade aerospace career, Lockheed Martin Skunk Works Engineering Technical Fellow Leland Nicolai captured this concept as the measure of merit: the \u201cqualitative aircraft characteristic that describes what is really important to the customer.\u201d The measure of merit is often an emotional or subjective customer preference that is otherwise unstated in the standard list of requirements. Both teams\u2019 designs had to navigate the Air Force\u2019s conflicting requirements in LO, maneuverability and supercruise performance.\n\nIn a 2021 interview with C.W. Lemoine, former ATF Technical Director Eric Abell recalled telling his Air Force colleagues the following regarding each company\u2019s briefings prior to the demonstration/validation (dem/val) phase: \u201cNorthrop is an engineering company which has hired some managers, and Lockheed is a management company which has hired some engineers.\u201d Both teams\u2019 designs and marketing approaches thoroughly reflected this prescient observation.\n\nNorthrop\u2019s measure-of-merit approach focusing on supercruise and LO matched comments in late 1985 from then-ATF Program Manager Albert Piccirillo comparing the ATF concept to World War I submarine warfare, with the aim being \u201cto kill without being seen, disengage and disappear.\u201d Chief Scientist Yu Ping Lui recounted Northrop\u2019s sentiment upon hearing Lockheed\u2019s source selection: \u201cI was crushed because we knew the numbers. We knew the RCS [radar cross-section] numbers they accomplished compared to ours. And there\u2019s no reason that we would lose. So I would not accept the fact.\u201d\n\nLockheed\u2019s strategy gauged maneuverability as the measure of merit, focusing on the preferences of its user base and evaluation authority instead of what was explicitly stated in the RFP. \u201cI think we gave the Air Force the airplane they secretly wanted, when Northrop built the airplane that was exactly what the Air Force asked for,\u201d YF-22 Test Pilot Tom Morgenfeld recalled.\n\nNorthrop YF-23 Test Pilot Paul Metz would later describe showmanship as a key ingredient in Lockheed\u2019s victory relative to the engineering logos of Northrop. Given the compressed schedule of the dem/val phase, Northrop concluded that the 90-day preparation time for high angle-of-attack (AoA) testing was not justified. The YF-23 PAV-1 demonstrated 25-deg. AoA, but Northrop provided engineering data showing its aircraft was controllable to 60 deg. Lockheed made high AoA testing a focal point of its dem/val flight-test program.\n\nSimilarly, Lockheed demonstrated live test firings of both the AIM-9 and AIM-120 air-to-air missiles, while Northrop declined to conduct live-fire launches and instead collected weapon bay data. Metz believes Lockheed\u2019s displays left a lasting impression on its customer and described its approach as emulating General Dynamics\u2019 iconic YF-16 versus F-4 turn radius demonstration, which was widely used to sell the program.\n\nLessons Learned\nAs the Air Force looks to award the NGAD contract this year, what will be the service\u2019s measure of merit? A key factor will be how Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall\u2019s extensive acquisition experience influences the source selection criteria. Kendall served as the undersecretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics from May 2012 to January 2017. In October 2012, he instructed DARPA to study next-generation air dominance concepts and subsequently launched the Aerospace Innovation Initiative in fiscal 2015. It could be fitting if Kendall serves as the NGAD SSA.\n\nIn 2019, according to then-Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein, the NGAD family of systems consists of five core elements: the platform itself, collaborative combat aircraft, adaptive-cycle engines and two classified components. The Air Force has spent at least $7 billion to date in adjusted fiscal 2025 dollars on pre-EMD efforts for NGAD, including technology maturation and risk reduction\u2014closely matching the approximately $6.4 billion government contribution to the ATF pre-EMD. Industry provided at least an additional $4 billion for the ATF. For that sum of approximately $10.4 billion, the service demonstrated and prototyped the following programs to support the ATF:\n\nUltra Reliable Radar program to mature active, electronically scanned array technologies.\nPave Pillar integrated avionics architecture.\nIntegrated Electronic Warfare Systems.\nF-15 Short-Takeoff-and-Landing/Maneuver Technology Demonstrator for thrust-reversing and supermaneuverability.\nFour prototype air vehicles (YF-22 and YF-23) with flightworthy YF119 and YF120 engines.\nGround-tested XF119 and XF120 engines.\nFull-scale RCS pole models to validate LO performance.\nTwo flying avionics laboratories to validate sensor fusion.\nThe Aerospace Innovation Initiative supporting NGAD similarly produced X-plane demonstrators, with at least one flying by September 2020.

                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Part 2:\nMeasure of Merit\nIndustry teams perceived different nuances within the ATF concept of operations and took divergent paths with their designs. In reflecting on his nearly six-decade aerospace career, Lockheed Martin Skunk Works Engineering Technical Fellow Leland Nicolai captured this concept as the measure of merit: the \u201cqualitative aircraft characteristic that describes what is really important to the customer.\u201d The measure of merit is often an emotional or subjective customer preference that is otherwise unstated in the standard list of requirements. Both teams\u2019 designs had to navigate the Air Force\u2019s conflicting requirements in LO, maneuverability and supercruise performance.</p>\n\n<p>In a 2021 interview with C.W. Lemoine, former ATF Technical Director Eric Abell recalled telling his Air Force colleagues the following regarding each company\u2019s briefings prior to the demonstration/validation (dem/val) phase: \u201cNorthrop is an engineering company which has hired some managers, and Lockheed is a management company which has hired some engineers.\u201d Both teams\u2019 designs and marketing approaches thoroughly reflected this prescient observation.</p>\n\n<p>Northrop\u2019s measure-of-merit approach focusing on supercruise and LO matched comments in late 1985 from then-ATF Program Manager Albert Piccirillo comparing the ATF concept to World War I submarine warfare, with the aim being \u201cto kill without being seen, disengage and disappear.\u201d Chief Scientist Yu Ping Lui recounted Northrop\u2019s sentiment upon hearing Lockheed\u2019s source selection: \u201cI was crushed because we knew the numbers. We knew the RCS [radar cross-section] numbers they accomplished compared to ours. And there\u2019s no reason that we would lose. So I would not accept the fact.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Lockheed\u2019s strategy gauged maneuverability as the measure of merit, focusing on the preferences of its user base and evaluation authority instead of what was explicitly stated in the RFP. \u201cI think we gave the Air Force the airplane they secretly wanted, when Northrop built the airplane that was exactly what the Air Force asked for,\u201d YF-22 Test Pilot Tom Morgenfeld recalled.</p>\n\n<p>Northrop YF-23 Test Pilot Paul Metz would later describe showmanship as a key ingredient in Lockheed\u2019s victory relative to the engineering logos of Northrop. Given the compressed schedule of the dem/val phase, Northrop concluded that the 90-day preparation time for high angle-of-attack (AoA) testing was not justified. The YF-23 PAV-1 demonstrated 25-deg. AoA, but Northrop provided engineering data showing its aircraft was controllable to 60 deg. Lockheed made high AoA testing a focal point of its dem/val flight-test program.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, Lockheed demonstrated live test firings of both the AIM-9 and AIM-120 air-to-air missiles, while Northrop declined to conduct live-fire launches and instead collected weapon bay data. Metz believes Lockheed\u2019s displays left a lasting impression on its customer and described its approach as emulating General Dynamics\u2019 iconic YF-16 versus F-4 turn radius demonstration, which was widely used to sell the program.</p>\n\n<p>Lessons Learned\nAs the Air Force looks to award the NGAD contract this year, what will be the service\u2019s measure of merit? A key factor will be how Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall\u2019s extensive acquisition experience influences the source selection criteria. Kendall served as the undersecretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics from May 2012 to January 2017. In October 2012, he instructed DARPA to study next-generation air dominance concepts and subsequently launched the Aerospace Innovation Initiative in fiscal 2015. It could be fitting if Kendall serves as the NGAD SSA.</p>\n\n<p>In 2019, according to then-Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein, the NGAD family of systems consists of five core elements: the platform itself, collaborative combat aircraft, adaptive-cycle engines and two classified components. The Air Force has spent at least $7 billion to date in adjusted fiscal 2025 dollars on pre-EMD efforts for NGAD, including technology maturation and risk reduction\u2014closely matching the approximately $6.4 billion government contribution to the ATF pre-EMD. Industry provided at least an additional $4 billion for the ATF. For that sum of approximately $10.4 billion, the service demonstrated and prototyped the following programs to support the ATF:</p>\n\n<p>Ultra Reliable Radar program to mature active, electronically scanned array technologies.\nPave Pillar integrated avionics architecture.\nIntegrated Electronic Warfare Systems.\nF-15 Short-Takeoff-and-Landing/Maneuver Technology Demonstrator for thrust-reversing and supermaneuverability.\nFour prototype air vehicles (YF-22 and YF-23) with flightworthy YF119 and YF120 engines.\nGround-tested XF119 and XF120 engines.\nFull-scale RCS pole models to validate LO performance.\nTwo flying avionics laboratories to validate sensor fusion.\nThe Aerospace Innovation Initiative supporting NGAD similarly produced X-plane demonstrators, with at least one flying by September 2020. Far fewer details about these demonstrators have been disclosed relative to the ATF, but following historical trends, these demonstrators likely tested individual pieces of NGAD.</p>\n\n<p>Kendall may take lessons from the Long-Range Strike Bomber competition, including funding both teams through the preliminary design review to reduce risk and mandating that early EMD prototypes be fitted with all the core avionics systems needed for initial operating capability. Both teams also are expected to submit digital designs utilizing model-based simulations. Notably, Boeing is believed to have gained an initial edge in this field by leveraging its commercial Black Diamond processes. As with the ATF and Joint Strike Fighter programs, NGAD demonstrators will likely play a pivotal role in deciding source selection.</p>\n\n<p>The ATF experience also highlights how winning proposals are more than the promise of next-generation aircraft designs. Teams of highly experienced engineers, program managers and acquisition community officials are required to translate designs into operational aircraft, which is a particularly troublesome point when Lockheed and Boeing arguably both suffer from poor program and project management.</p>\n</div>",

The proximity and high possibility of formal diplomatic relations between the Saudis and Israelis was one of the reasons suggested for Hamas's attack on 10/7. Excerpts:\n\n>[US and Saudis Near Defense Pact Aimed at Reshaping Middle East](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-01/us-and-saudis-near-defense-pact-aimed-at-reshaping-middle-east?srnd=homepage-americas)\n\n>* Plan would offer incentives for Israel to end war with Hamas\n>* Agreement paves way for Saudis to get advanced weapons\n\n>The US and Saudi Arabia are nearing a historic pact that would offer the kingdom security guarantees and lay out a possible pathway to diplomatic ties with Israel, people familiar with the matter said.\n\n>The agreement faces plenty of obstacles but would amount to a new version of a framework that was scuttled when Hamas\u2019s Oct. 7 attack on Israel triggered the conflict in the Gaza Strip. Negotiations have sped up in recent weeks and many officials are optimistic that Washington and Riyadh could reach a deal within weeks, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations.\n\n>Such a deal would potentially reshape the Middle East. Beyond bolstering Israel and Saudi Arabia\u2019s security, it would strengthen the US\u2019s position in the region at the expense of Iran and even China.\n\n>The pact may offer Saudi Arabia an arrangement strong enough to need the US Senate\u2019s approval and even give the world\u2019s biggest oil exporter access to advanced US weapons that were previously off-limits. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman would agree to limit Chinese technology from his nation\u2019s most sensitive networks in exchange for major US investments, and get American help to build out its civilian nuclear program.\n\n>Once the US and Saudi Arabia settle their agreement, they would present Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with a choice: either join the deal, which would entail formal diplomatic ties with Saudi Arabia for the first time, more investment and regional integration, or be left behind. The key condition for Netanyahu would be ending the Gaza war and agreeing to a pathway for Palestinian statehood.\n\n>The proposal is fraught with uncertainty. Getting Congress to approve a deal that commits the US to protecting Saudi Arabia militarily would be a daunting prospect for the White House, especially if Israel opts not to join it. Many lawmakers remain wary of Prince Mohammed, the kingdom\u2019s 38-year-old de facto ruler, after the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in 2018. They\u2019re also uneasy about the Saudi strategy of lowering oil production, along with other members of the OPEC+ cartel, to prop up prices.\n\n>Netanyahu, the biggest wild card, could take credit for normalizing relations with the biggest economy in the Middle East and guardian of Islam\u2019s holiest sites \u2014 a goal he\u2019s long coveted.\n\n>US officials said talks are underway but declined to comment on specifics. Saudi Arabia\u2019s government didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.

As originally conceived, the agreement would have been a three-way deal that forged Saudi-Israeli diplomatic relations along with greater investment and integration in the region.\n\n>Now, the US and Saudi Arabia see a deal with each other as central to ending the war between Israel and Hamas, which has roiled the wider Middle East and led to huge protests in the West. The two countries would offer Israel a series of economic, security and diplomatic incentives if it scales back plans for an invasion of Rafah and quickly concludes its war with Hamas.\n\n>For Netanyahu, another advantage would is that a pact would help counter Iran\u2019s aggression. Since the war in Gaza erupted, Israel and Iran have exchanged their first-ever direct fire against one another and Tehran\u2019s proxy militias such as Hezbollah have regularly attacked the Jewish state.\n\n>Aspects of the deal would mirror agreements the US has made in recent months with other regional partners, including the United Arab Emirates.

The CPI had by far the strongest correlation with RGDP/Cap, explaining over three fourths of the variance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Acemoglu talks about these feedback loops too in his talks and books.</p>\n</div>",

He talked about some videos where they drop mines 10 - 20 meters ahead of an advancing tank, and there is just not way for the tank to stop. The goal is to take out the tracks and then they kill the tank later on with other kinds of drones.",

The Russians have whole engineering units dedicated to *just* digging fortifications for actual troops to occupy, the Ukrainians are working with the engineers in each individual unit (whose focus is obviously going to be on the ground they currently hold).\n\nThink of it like the whole Hindenburg line in WW1. Frontline troops can\u2019t build a Hindenburg line because they\u2019re too busy being on the frontline and improving the defences there. You need to dedicate a lot of manpower and resources specifically to build a defensive line behind your current frontline. \n\nYou also need to be able to *politically* do so: would the French have been willing to abandon their own land in order to get a better defensive position?

Retreating also exposes more towns to destruction in the fighting and the rigors of Russian occupation - often looting, or worse.\n\nYour example of WW1 in France is a good one, and to that I'd add the example of Poland in WW2.

                    "body": ">two world wars were fought almost entirely using conscripted manpower\n\nI don't think we can or should look at WW1/WW2 conscripts and take away some lessons from that era back to the present. Just at the most basic level, physical fitness is way down on average. Ukraine and Russia are both comparatively poorer than most other countries, so they have a slight advantage in this regard; but the obesity rates for example are still 3-4x times as high compared to say the early 1900s. \n\nAnother factor that I think is much different is level of nationalism/patriotism, that has simply dropped over time. Obviously Ukraine and Russia are at war and are thus going to be at a much heightened level of nationalism, but the point is that the baseline is much lower to the past.\n\nAll of that said, yeah manpower isn't an issue from a strictly military perspective if you assume the state will actually commit.

Just at the most basic level, physical fitness is way down on average. Ukraine and Russia are both comparatively poorer than most other countries, so they have a slight advantage in this regard; but the obesity rates for example are still 3-4x times as high compared to say the early 1900s. </p>\n\n<p>Another factor that I think is much different is level of nationalism/patriotism, that has simply dropped over time. Obviously Ukraine and Russia are at war and are thus going to be at a much heightened level of nationalism, but the point is that the baseline is much lower to the past.</p>\n\n<p>All of that said, yeah manpower isn&#39;t an issue from a strictly military perspective if you assume the state will actually commit.

        "body": "An article that gives details on Russia's success around Avdiivka.  Confirmation that the regular Russian army is using the wave tactics that Wagner did in Bakmut with initial assaults using less well-trained reservists and skilled regular army troops carry out follow-up assaults.  And confirmation that there has been no evidence that Western supplies have reached this area of the front.  The biggest open question is whether the UAF being pushed back is in fact part of a change in doctrine or if they are just using the change in doctrine as an excuse to coverup that they have allowed a breakthrough in the lines.  The article sums up the two positions:\n\n*Optimists point to Russian assaults around Kyiv and Mykolaiv in 2022, and the Serebryansky Forest and Avdiivka in 2023 as evidence that if the terrain and ammunition allow it, the Ukrainian military is fully capable of making Russian attacks so bloody the Kremlin calls them off. No army can take casualties forever, they argue.*\n\n*Pessimists also point to Avdiivka, and the fact after six months of failed assaults and heavy losses Russian troops finally prevailed, even though Ukraine told Western allies for more than two years that it needed enough firepower to prevent something like that.*\n\n[Kremlin\u2019s Recent Successes Around Avdiivka \u2013 5 Things to Know | Kyiv Post | May 2024](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/31973)\n\n*On Ukraine\u2019s side both the optimists and pessimists point to Avdiivka to back their ideas and positions. Here are five key takeaways you should learn about Avdiivka to get a more balanced, realistic picture of Ukrainian strategy and tactics.*\n\n**1. The Russians really are gaining ground and the pace really is accelerating.**\n\n*The Russian army captured the city of Avdiivka in February after nearly six months of attacking, taking fortifications the Ukrainians had held since 2014. Since then, the Kremlin\u2019s forces have pushed northwest about 10 kilometers (6 miles) \u2013 about 2 kilometers in the past ten days.*\n\n*The bulge in Ukrainian lines is about a kilometer wide at the tip and five or six at the base, so it\u2019s not a breakthrough. But, at the same time, this pace of advance \u2013 roughly a kilometer a week or a few hundred meters a day \u2013 is the fastest pace of Russian advance since the early months of the war.*\n\n*The Russian tactics are exploiting Ukrainian manpower shortages and particularly near-total Russian dominance of the air. The Russian Air Force is dropping glide bombs in quantity, which are not too accurate but are often able to saturate a wood line or village the Ukrainians are trying to hold. Ukraine is starved for long-range air defense systems and has almost no air force, so the Russian bombers drop the glide bombs with impunity.*\n\n*Next, the Russians shell a Ukrainian position, and their shell supplies typically outnumber the Ukrainians\u2019 five to one. Then the Russians send troops aboard armored vehicles to assault the Ukrainian positions. The Russians often take heavy losses, but if the attacks are kept up the Ukrainians have run out \u2013 of ammunition, unwounded soldiers, or even just fighting positions not wrecked by artillery or bombs.*\n\n*Local Russian commanders act intelligently, have searched for Ukrainian weak points and take advantage of them when they can. To the west of Avdiivka, a muddled Ukrainian troop rotation was hit with a Russian assault, breaking up elements of Ukraine\u2019s 115th Brigade and netting the Kremlin more than a kilometer of ground overnight. Isolated Ukrainian strongpoints are outflanked and hit simultaneously from several sides. Initial loads of attacking troops are often less well-trained reservists, while skilled regular army troops carry out follow-up assaults.*\n\n*Once the Ukrainians retreat the Russians take aim at another wood line or defensive position 200-500 meters away, and the process repeats itself. From the Ukrainian point of view the most worrying aspect of the Russian attacks is that the Ukrainian military clearly has ways to slow them down, but so far has not shown itself able to stop them completely.*\n\n**2. Partly, the Russians are advancing faster because the Ukrainians changed strategy and tactics.**\n\n*Syrsky\u2019s battlefield tactics, and the junior commanders he has chosen to execute them, have shifted Ukrainian priorities from holding ground to preserving Ukrainian troops and inflicting as many casualties on Russian forces as possible. Drones \u2013 instead of artillery or tanks \u2013 have become the main strike weapon of the Ukrainian Ground Forces. In defense, the Ukrainian infantry mostly lays low as FPV and bomber drones, sometimes operating in swarms, seek out approaching Russian combat vehicles and even individual soldiers. Artillery and mortar ammunition is saved for quick barrage when the Russians are caught out in the open, hopefully when they hit a minefield. Since mines (like almost everything else) are short in the Ukrainian army, drone operators sometimes wait to see where a Russian attack column is driving, and then dump mines in their path.*\n\n*Ukrainian soldier losses are kept relatively low by allowing local commanders to pull troops out of a position before the Russians swamp it, or, if the bombs and shells are coming in too thickly, before the defensive line is plowed up and troops no longer are able to shelter there. Also, the Syrsky-led army places a minimum number of soldiers in forward position, so that overall losses are reduced but, at the same time, accepting that if Russian infantry reaches a Ukrainian position the few defenders might get overwhelmed.*\n\n**3. General Syrsky\u2019s strategy and tactics arguably are working, and the Russians are taking brutal losses.**\n\n*By almost any objective measure \u2013 and there are more than a few \u2013 the Ukrainian delaying tactics are inflicting vicious casualties on Russian forces. Open-source statisticians reviewing confirmed kill evidence \u2013 for the most part battlefield video \u2013 estimate that for every Ukrainian tank or armored personnel carrier lost on the battlefield the Russian military loses between three or four combat vehicles. Troop losses are harder to compute, but the Ukrainian military has reported that its internal count of Russian soldiers killed or severely wounded on the battlefield are at an all-time high.*\n\n*Anecdotal evidence of how that is playing out for the average soldier is limited but seems to confirm that Russian soldiers see themselves as being thrown into repeated, bloody attacks against 24/7 drone swarms. Ukrainian soldiers see themselves as up against massive assaults where, sometimes, there is no option but to retreat from.*\n\n*Repeatedly, Russian armored attacks have been cut to pieces by Ukrainian drone defenses, but, in a local battle lasting days or even weeks the Ukrainians in the Avdiivka sector have not been able to stop the Russian infantry assaults completely. This means Syrsky\u2019s tactics, though excellent for destroying Russian troops and equipment, have been unable to halt Russian ground advances in sectors where the Kremlin particularly wants \u201csuccess,\u201d like Avdiivka.*\n\n**4. Remember All those weapons Congress Just \u201cGave\u201d Ukraine? Definitely not in Avdiivka.**\n\n*After four months of delay, the US Congress approved a new $61 billion arms assistance package to Ukraine, and on April 24, the same day that he signed the aid package, US President Joe Biden also signed off on an emergency delivery of $1 billion of critically needed weapons and ammunition.*\n\n*Russian troops, a week later, on April 30, in fighting west of Avdiivka took over about six square kilometers of Ukraine\u2019s territory.*\n\n*Promised American assistance in the April 24 emergency assistance package, that are specifically designed to destroy ground attacks like the ones Russia is making around Avdiivka, included: 155mm artillery rounds (including High Explosive and Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions rounds); 105mm artillery rounds;  60mm mortar rounds; Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles; Tube-Launched, Optically-Tracked, Wire-Guided (TOW) missiles; Javelin and AT-4 anti-armor systems; Precision aerial munitions; Anti-armor mines and Claymore anti-personnel munitions.*\n\n*Aside from scattered artillery strikes potentially caused by US-made 105mm or 155mm shells, Kyiv Post reviews of battlefield accounts and video geo-located to Avdiivka found no evidence that any of that American assistance had reached the Avdiivka battlefield.*\n\n**5. The key things to watch are Russian troop losses and Ukrainian artillery shell supplies. Syrsky\u2019s doctrine depends on plenty of firepower.**\n\n*Ukraine\u2019s European allies likewise have promised Kyiv a great deal of battlefield assistance but been slow to deliver, but in the Europeans\u2019 case the problem appears to have been less Washington-style political wrangling and ineffectiveness, and more logistics and production capacity.*\n\n*By far, the Western battlefield assistance Ukrainian soldiers ask for the most is artillery ammunition which, were it available in quantity in Avdiivka, would be pounding Russian attack columns the moment they drove out into the open and not stopping until survivors retreated or were crushed.*",

Definitely not in Avdiivka.</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>After four months of delay, the US Congress approved a new $61 billion arms assistance package to Ukraine, and on April 24, the same day that he signed the aid package, US President Joe Biden also signed off on an emergency delivery of $1 billion of critically needed weapons and ammunition.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Russian troops, a week later, on April 30, in fighting west of Avdiivka took over about six square kilometers of Ukraine\u2019s territory.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Promised American assistance in the April 24 emergency assistance package, that are specifically designed to destroy ground attacks like the ones Russia is making around Avdiivka, included: 155mm artillery rounds (including High Explosive and Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions rounds); 105mm artillery rounds;  60mm mortar rounds; Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles; Tube-Launched, Optically-Tracked, Wire-Guided (TOW) missiles; Javelin and AT-4 anti-armor systems; Precision aerial munitions; Anti-armor mines and Claymore anti-personnel munitions.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Aside from scattered artillery strikes potentially caused by US-made 105mm or 155mm shells, Kyiv Post reviews of battlefield accounts and video geo-located to Avdiivka found no evidence that any of that American assistance had reached the Avdiivka battlefield.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>5. The key things to watch are Russian troop losses and Ukrainian artillery shell supplies. Syrsky\u2019s doctrine depends on plenty of firepower.</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Ukraine\u2019s European allies likewise have promised Kyiv a great deal of battlefield assistance but been slow to deliver, but in the Europeans\u2019 case the problem appears to have been less Washington-style political wrangling and ineffectiveness, and more logistics and production capacity.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>By far, the Western battlefield assistance Ukrainian soldiers ask for the most is artillery ammunition which, were it available in quantity in Avdiivka, would be pounding Russian attack columns the moment they drove out into the open and not stopping until survivors retreated or were crushed.</em></p>\n</div>",
