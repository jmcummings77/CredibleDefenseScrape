US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and his German counterpart Christine Lambrecht will also meet in Berlin the day before.  \n\n\n>At the Ramstein meeting, Lambrecht will send a clear message on the Leopards, the official said. As of Thursday, Berlin still hadn\u2019t made a concrete decision, but pressure is mounting for Germany to send heavy tanks, according to another European official.   \n\n>The UK is prepared to send its own Challenger 2 battle tanks to Ukraine as part of a joint agreement with other allies, the official said. \n\n>>Armored Vehicles\n\n>Chancellor Olaf Scholz has come under increasing pressure to allow the delivery of battle tanks to Ukraine, one week after he announced that Germany would supply armored vehicles and an additional Patriot air system to Kyiv. \n\n>Now there are signs that Scholz may be willing to back down from his initial opposition to sending Leopard tanks or that he may allow countries like Poland and Finland to re-export their own Leopards to Ukraine, a move that would require Berlin\u2019s consent. \n\n>\u201cGermany should not stand in the way, when other countries decide to support Ukraine, regardless of what Germany decides,\u201d Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck said Thursday with regard to Poland\u2019s request to send Leopard 2 tanks. Justice Minister Marco Buschmann also said in an interview on Friday that sending Leopard 2 tanks \u201cshould not be a taboo.\u201d\n\n>German government spokeswoman Chistiane Hoffmann said that the Polish government has so far not made an official request and made clear that sending these tanks without Germany\u2019s permission would be \u201cillegal.\u201d\n\n>\u201cThe approval by the federal government is needed,\u201d Hoffman said at a regular government press conference in Berlin. \u201cThese are the rules.\u201d \n\n>It\u2019s still unclear if Germany will only allow other countries to send Leopard tanks or if it will send such tanks itself. Besides the Leopard 2 tanks, there are still about 180 versions of the older Leopard 1 in Germany.

Otherwise Russian wins. \n\nThat was likely why they still held it after March, especially why they were continuously firing on it, it forced the UAF to commit a large force structure to defend it, who couldn't be used elsewhere. \n\nBut then the UAF replicated the Russians, who only had 5-7 BTGs holding that entire sector (very thin line), which is why the UAF counteroffensive in late April and early May was so effective at retaking ground, pushing the Russians to their border, pushing them to the Donets River, etc. \n\nThat then forced the Russians to counterattack in force to win back that lost ground, which meant units it had flagged for fighting in the Donbas were committed to Kharkiv, which favored the UAF, though who also had amassed extra forces in Kharkiv to hold what they had, etc. \n\nSuddenly both sides were stuck in a seesaw campaign that lasted for months and months, wasting forces and resources in a sideline sector of no real strategic significance. The only question was who was wasting more forces and resources, whose efforts were hurting their strategic main effort in a meaningful way. If either side believes their opponent is suffering more, the diversion is worth it. \n\nIf the Russians can replicate that with a counteroffensive into Kharkiv oblast, they can take the pressure off Luhansk oblast in particular, potentially reestablish their supply like to Belgorod, etc. Even if they only threaten it, that still requires lots of UAF units to hold the line in force, who can't be used elsewhere. \n\nThat's especially appealing because it especially affects the decision making abilities of the Zelensky's govt. Will UA be willing to risk losing what they'd liberated in Kharkiv oblast in September in the hopes they might use the massed forces for better effect somewhere elsewhere?

Otherwise Russian wins. </p>\n\n<p>That was likely why they still held it after March, especially why they were continuously firing on it, it forced the UAF to commit a large force structure to defend it, who couldn&#39;t be used elsewhere. </p>\n\n<p>But then the UAF replicated the Russians, who only had 5-7 BTGs holding that entire sector (very thin line), which is why the UAF counteroffensive in late April and early May was so effective at retaking ground, pushing the Russians to their border, pushing them to the Donets River, etc. </p>\n\n<p>That then forced the Russians to counterattack in force to win back that lost ground, which meant units it had flagged for fighting in the Donbas were committed to Kharkiv, which favored the UAF, though who also had amassed extra forces in Kharkiv to hold what they had, etc. </p>\n\n<p>Suddenly both sides were stuck in a seesaw campaign that lasted for months and months, wasting forces and resources in a sideline sector of no real strategic significance. The only question was who was wasting more forces and resources, whose efforts were hurting their strategic main effort in a meaningful way. If either side believes their opponent is suffering more, the diversion is worth it. </p>\n\n<p>If the Russians can replicate that with a counteroffensive into Kharkiv oblast, they can take the pressure off Luhansk oblast in particular, potentially reestablish their supply like to Belgorod, etc. Even if they only threaten it, that still requires lots of UAF units to hold the line in force, who can&#39;t be used elsewhere. </p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s especially appealing because it especially affects the decision making abilities of the Zelensky&#39;s govt. Will UA be willing to risk losing what they&#39;d liberated in Kharkiv oblast in September in the hopes they might use the massed forces for better effect somewhere elsewhere? Or will they play it safe, temporarily halt or limit ops elsewhere to reinforce Kharkiv (or anywhere else along the northern border that might be under &quot;threat&quot; of another invasion) just to avoid the bad press of losing ground again in another invasion?</p>\n</div>",

I don&#39;t think he will make a possible offensive in the Russian army this spring because he has worn out his own troops on mud-covered fields all winter. Ukraine must protect its forces for a possible late spring or early summer attack.</p>\n</div>",

Look at Stalingrad. Look at Fallujah, where POTUS not only directly got involved but countermanded tactical level commander recommendations. Which is the perogotive of senior leaders, they're allowed to do it, its part of their resume.

If its happening everywhere, and against the recommendations of the UAF as the Nov RUSI report stated (a source YOU CANNOT DENOUNCE), then it means it was politically influenced by the UA govt (meaning Zelensky). \n\nWhich as I mentioned to you yesterday, is still no reason for you to constantly get defensive about, as its not at all unique.

However, a UAF platoon or company defending in a specific way at the tactical level is often the result of strategic decisions. \"Hold at all cost, we're not giving away any more territory unless we can't hold it\" is a political high strategic decision that reverberates down to the individual soldier level. \n\nTo make that analogy work for offensive ops, the offensive must be done in a certain way, namely grinding attritional battle (aka meat grinder) that necessitates strategic and political involvement, because high levels of casualties, loss of equipment, major logistical diversions, excessive media attention are all political concerns.

The Kherson bridgehead was a strategic level front, Putin had political reasons to not retreat, and whether or not it was a good idea doesn't matter, its his job to consider politics. \n\nSame with Donbas and Soledar. Sometimes the right military decision isn't the right political decision, which is why political leaders often overrule military leaders' advice. But that doesn't mean they were right in doing it, sometimes its a bad decision. \n\nThe argument here is whether or not the \"hold at all cost\" decision to hold Soledar was worth it, considering its been a full week of being placed in an ever increasing untenable position.

Right or wrong doesn't matter, that's proof he got involved already.\n\n\\- That decision translated into rigid, stubborn, and costly tactical defensive fights, ala Summer 2023, because when that strategic guidance is given, it looks a specific way. When one knows enough to be able to see those signs, aka actually bothering to look at the battle of Soledar and Bakhmut at large, its like not needing the weather channel anymore to tell you its raining when you can see the rain outside your window. \n\n\\- Did anything seem to change since then? Are the UAF fighting any bit differently in the Donbas now as opposed to then? No, its the same, Hold at all cost. Meaning the policy didn't change, there are still political considerations that demand positional fighting, the question only becomes what the political reasons (almost surely more than one) actually are. \n\nFear of civilians falling into Russian hands? Doubtful, and absolutely preventable so it wouldn't justify it. \n\nI lean towards the fear of bad press of a Russian victory (despite it being Pyrrhic) and a definitive hit on pride for losing territory. As the poster who I replied to made it a point to emphasize, despite the horror of the last week plus, Soledar still holds! That is the mindset encouraging \"hold at all costs,\" because they don't want to lose it. Holding means victory, and they're not worried about the physical costs for whatever reason.",

Thanks. I'm going to use this for record now, Draskla finally admitted the UA govt intervened, with the political reasons being utterly inconsequential to the discussion.\n\nNow that we got out of the way, let's focus on what that political decision means. No maneuver defense leaves only positional defense, with no retreats authorized until the defensive position is made totally untenable (outflanked, pushed out, defenders rendered hors de combat) or loses its political significance (destroyed to the point it's not worth defending as justification). That means hold at all cost. And that only looks a specific way, because tactics can only carry out that strategic policy a certain way. \n\nIf someone knows what to look for, they can see it, just like if they understand how the weather works they don't need weather channel to tell them it's raining.\n\nThe UAF never switched defensive tactics\n\n>I'm not even going to get into the last two sentences, because you've already arrived at a conspiracy laced explanation for why RUSI says what they say there. \n\nSuggesring national govt leaders engage in political decision making in war is only conspiracy to someone working overtime to make sure the UA govt doesn't look bad ever. \n\n>Why is there no reporting of this direct and clear command?\n\nThere doesn't need to be a direct and clear command to know something happened, anymore than they needed to know Putin's reasons why they're still attacking Bakhmut to speculate for months about why, with each creating their own pet theory the same way I am. \n\nAnd other OSINT analysts don't need to quote me or echo what I say that's negative about Zelensky, nor would I expect them to, because:\n\n- They're professional academics who can't afford to speculate the way I can, as I post on Reddit when I'm bored, taking a shit, or otherwise not doing something useful\n\n- There are political costs for them that are legitimate if they criticize Ukraine at all, especially senior brass. They can lose sources, they can sour relationships, they can even be blacklisted, which would be a career killer for them. I'm a nobody and don't have a single source from Ukraine feeding me intel and insight that keeps my mortgage paid. But I don't care if you're not happy. In fact, I consider it a point of pride that someone like you finds fault with what I post, it means I'm on the right track. \n\n- They're much more loyal to Ukraine than I. Note, I do want Ukraine to win and Russia to lose but not nearly as much as them, my loyalty is to my family, my job, my country, and that's it. For me this war is like watching the Superbowl between two teams I don't follow. One of them is the Patriots, so obviously I want them to lose. But I'm more into the sport than this specific game, my commentary reflects that, I'm not impartial but I'm much closer to OSINT analysts. \n\n- Most of their commentary is on Russia and not Ukraine for a reason, because they're loyal to Ukraine for various reasons and aren't willing to sling shit or break OPSEC. Kofman in particular made it a point numerous times to say that he won't get into detail about Ukraine future abilities or plans because it could have OPSEC implications. I'm not a participant, and while I want Russia to lose I'm much less involved in struggly morally over what I write. I have 200 followers, not 2 million. \n\n- Most of them have almost never commented at all about Ukraine national politics, period. For instance, Kofman mentions all the time the UAF weren't prepared for the invasion, but did he ever get into a discussion about why? Nope, that's outside the scope of their work. But I'm fine talking about it, especially to clue people in that war is much more complex and nefarious than the propagandists who have us believe.\n\n- They're afraid of people like you. If they say the wrong thing they lose supporters, catch hate mail, their employers get bombed on social media demanding the traitors be fired, etc. I don't give a shit about any of that. I \"speak my truth\" whether it's popular or not. I don't care, this is an outlet for my id, not how I feed my family. If I get banned I'll spend more time with my family, oh noes.\n\nThat said, the western OSINT analysts all have said repeatedly that the UAF are fighting a battle of attrition. \n\nIs that against their will? Nope, they not only can retreat any time they want, but they can switch to an active defense any time they want. But they don't. They still use the exact same tactics they used \"at the start of the Donbas campaign\" and through the whole thing until now. \n\nBecause nothing changed, from top down. If they haven't changed at the tactical level, it's because operational scheme is the same as those define what tactics are used.

No maneuver defense leaves only positional defense, with no retreats authorized until the defensive position is made totally untenable (outflanked, pushed out, defenders rendered hors de combat) or loses its political significance (destroyed to the point it&#39;s not worth defending as justification). That means hold at all cost.

They can lose sources, they can sour relationships, they can even be blacklisted, which would be a career killer for them.

I've said many times before that I trust his estimate. What isn't clear to me is whether Milley was including DPR/LPR troops, Wagner and Rosgvardiya in his estimate.

I also don't know how you define \"casualties\" and what KIA/casualty ratios are for either side.
