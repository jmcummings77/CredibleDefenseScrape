Particularly this report touched on the readiness of US spare parts for armored vehicles, the article focuses primarily on Abrams, Brad, and Stryker parts. These are the exact kinds of stockpiles the Army needs to get refurbished equipment up to speed for Ukraine, but as the report suggests a lot of it is in quite poor shape.\n\nThe report details how a large portion of spare parts are in unserviceable condition, citing for example 273 spare transmissions which are in longterm storage but also not in working condition. The Army only service 24 a year. Making matters worse, the report found a lot of this stock is comingled with working parts. Which means you have no idea what is good and what is bad until you open up the box, or pull the block out of a yard, and dig into it. There is no 'off the shelf' solution, as it were. Add to it, and as the photos suggests, a lot of equipment is being stored in open air yards that increase the likelihood of rust and further degradation of supplies. About 1/3rd of all parts examined by the audit suffered from some kind of critical deficiency, though the linked article doesn't say if 'critical' means mechanically unreliable, or something else (apparently a ton of OSHA violations on top of problems with the actual equipment.) And apparently a lot of this is not being stored out in the desert, as the report highlights the adverse effect of moisture and humidity on spare parts stored in open air yards. \n\nI bring this up because so often here you see people say 'oh well the US has a thousand Bradleys in the desert they can just give to Ukraine.' Likewise, a ton of speculation as to why itll take, what, a year(?) to get them the full Abrams order? Stuff like this highlights why those stocks are not really easily movable. First who knows what a tank in an Arizona bone yard looks like on the inside, what its been stripped of for active units. Second, any work to get that vehicle moving requires spares to get it up to speed and here were seeing that the Army has not done a great job maintaining its pool of backstock. And last you see, thanks to underfunding, a very very limited throughput for fixing problems. With the capacity to refurbish only 24 transmissions a year at Army yards, its probably faster to just pay GDLand to build more new trannys. Setting aside thats a dumb way to run an army, it seems like the manufacturer is really currently the only one able to do serious work on US vehicles, and then only by redistributing new-made parts.",

            "body": "**[China Naval Modernization: Implications for \r\nU.S. Navy Capabilities\u2014Background and \r\nIssues for Congress](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/details?prodcode=RL33153)**\n\nThe Congressional Research Service has drawn up a very in-depth comparison of all kinds of metrics between the U.S. Navy and China's Navy. It was last updated on the 19th of October 2023. One of the sources is the DOD report linked in another comment. \n\n> **Summary**\n\n> China\u2019s military modernization effort, including its naval modernization effort, is the top focus of \r\nU.S. defense planning and budgeting. China\u2019s naval modernization effort has been underway for \r\nabout 30 years, since the early to mid-1990s, and has transformed China\u2019s navy into a much more \r\nmodern and capable force. China\u2019s navy is a formidable military force within China\u2019s near-seas \r\nregion, and it is conducting a growing number of operations in the broader waters of the Western \r\nPacific, the Indian Ocean, and waters around Europe.\n\n\r\n> China\u2019s navy is, by far, the largest of any country in East Asia, and sometime between 2015 and \r\n2020 it surpassed the U.S. Navy in numbers of battle force ships. DOD states that China\u2019s navy \r\n\u201cis the largest navy in the world with a battle force of over 370 platforms, including major surface \r\ncombatants, submarines, ocean-going amphibious ships, mine warfare ships, aircraft carriers, and \r\nfleet auxiliaries. Notably, this figure does not include approximately 60 HOUBEI-class patrol \r\ncombatants that carry anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCM). The\u2026 overall battle force [of China\u2019s \r\nnavy] is expected to grow to 395 ships by 2025 and 435 ships by 2030.\u201d The U.S. Navy, by \r\ncomparison, included 291 battle force ships as of October 19, 2023, and the Navy\u2019s FY2024\r\nbudget submission projects that the Navy will include 290 battle force ships by the end of \r\nFY2030.

It was last updated on the 19th of October 2023. One of the sources is the DOD report linked in another comment. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n\n<p>China\u2019s military modernization effort, including its naval modernization effort, is the top focus of \nU.S. defense planning and budgeting. China\u2019s naval modernization effort has been underway for \nabout 30 years, since the early to mid-1990s, and has transformed China\u2019s navy into a much more \nmodern and capable force. China\u2019s navy is a formidable military force within China\u2019s near-seas \nregion, and it is conducting a growing number of operations in the broader waters of the Western \nPacific, the Indian Ocean, and waters around Europe.</p>\n\n<p>China\u2019s navy is, by far, the largest of any country in East Asia, and sometime between 2015 and \n2020 it surpassed the U.S. Navy in numbers of battle force ships. DOD states that China\u2019s navy \n\u201cis the largest navy in the world with a battle force of over 370 platforms, including major surface \ncombatants, submarines, ocean-going amphibious ships, mine warfare ships, aircraft carriers, and \nfleet auxiliaries. Notably, this figure does not include approximately 60 HOUBEI-class patrol \ncombatants that carry anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCM). The\u2026 overall battle force [of China\u2019s \nnavy] is expected to grow to 395 ships by 2025 and 435 ships by 2030.\u201d The U.S. Navy, by \ncomparison, included 291 battle force ships as of October 19, 2023, and the Navy\u2019s FY2024\nbudget submission projects that the Navy will include 290 battle force ships by the end of \nFY2030. U.S. military officials and other observers are expressing concern or alarm regarding the \npace of China\u2019s naval shipbuilding effort, the capacity of China\u2019s shipbuilding industry compared \nwith the capacity of the U.S. shipbuilding industry, and resulting trend lines regarding the relative \nsizes and capabilities of China\u2019s navy and the U.S. Navy.</p>\n\n<p>China\u2019s naval modernization effort encompasses a wide array of ship, aircraft, weapon, and \nC4ISR (command and control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and \nreconnaissance) acquisition programs, as well as improvements in logistics, doctrine, personnel \nquality, education and training, and exercises.

That particular conspiracy is so entrenched in the casual western understanding of Vladimir Putin that it inspired an infamous Call of Duty mission. Except that's not what happened.\n\nIn the aftermath of the First Chechen War, a central Chechen government failed to materialize. In theory, the *de facto* republic was run by Ashlan Maskhadov, but in reality it was an anarchic state comparable to Somalia or Haiti. The Maskhadov government fought against both secular nationalist and Islamist factions, with the latter receiving some support from al-Qaeda. Chechnya became a haven for organized crime, with Chechen groups for example committing kidnappings for ransom and running car-jacking rings. It was a pirate state that Moscow tried to tolerate, but the issue kept getting worse.\n\nThe issue came to a head when Islamist groups in Chechnya launched an offensive into Dagestan in August 1999. The Kremlin had planned an intervention as early as December 1998, but the Dagestan offensive made the issue more urgent. The offensive was repelled, but the next month, apartment complexes across Russian metro areas (especially Moscow) were infamously bombed, resulting in hundreds dead. The conspiracy theory of events supposes that this was orchestrated by the FSB to solidify Putin's grip on power (who succeeded Yeltsin, himself evading corruption charges), and evidence is mostly on the Ryazan incident (in which an apartment reported suspicious assailants carrying potential ordinance, but was later \"clarified\" as an FSB training exercise) and an infamous quip by the Russian parliament speaker saying Volgodonsk was bombed (which didn't happen, but would occur days later). However, evidence from Ryazan is far from concrete (including the material found not being flammable and relying on questionable testimony) and it wouldn't make sense to carry out a bombing you publically admitted to planning a few days earlier. We also know that Islamist groups were more than capable of planning such operations.\n\n(The whole thing is a shitshow, but Redakciya's subtitled documentary on the incident is the best on this subject, and r/Askhistorians has discussion on the subject as well).\n\nAnyway, Chechnya was invaded by Russia. It was a completely legal operation, as Chechnya did not have a constitutional right to succeed from the Soviet Union (unlike Ukraine, which did, and was universally recognized) and was not recognized by any UN member.\n\nThe counterinsurgency operation would not pass muster by American standards, but was far more competent compared to the first one. Russian commanders were intimately familiar with the area and culture, and many Chechens themselves could speak Russian. Older generations could remember a time of stability and relative prosperity compared to the anarchy of independent Chechnya. Maskhadov's government had no control over the situation, and they were ignored.\n\nChechnya is totalitarian even by Russian standards, but Kadyrov is competent and popular in the area, with the autonomous Chechnya having a strong sense of legitimacy. Moscow poured in a fuck load of money into the region, providing a much higher standard of living than independent Ichkeria ever could. Yeah, it's heavily impoverished by Western standards, but living standards are compared to say sub-Saharan Africa or much of Asia. Why revolt when the government is keeping things stable and providing food/employment?\n\nI don't write that as Putin apologia, but Reddit likes to see everything Putin's Russia has done prior to 2014 as uniformly bad. Reality is far more complex, and things don't always correlate. I.e. the idea that Chechnya was \"the blueprint for Ukraine\" is laughable. \n\nThe only other COIN-OP comparable to this is the Chiapas conflict that was resolved by 1998 in Mexico, with the area being quickly re-integrated into the metropole and the idea of full on revolt being an idea of the past, as a lot of money and resources have been poured into the area, with indigenous Mexicans being able to gain employment in other areas of Mexico which is undergoing an economic boom. Again, why piss in the well that bathes you?\n\nIn both cases, the rebelling population was a lot more amiable to government intervention. This sentiment does not exist in the Israeli/Palestinean conflict. Israel and its allies had better bring 20 Brinks trucks after this is done and provide a standard of living that's at least tolerable to Gazans. A Second Nakba will not work, and it's not like the Israelis need such a small piece of real estate anyway.",

The prophecy of Isaiah is traditionally attributed to right before the exile and the destruction of the temple (where al-Aqsa mosque currently is).  Isaiah's prophecies have roughly three parts.  The first section deals with contemporary events of Isaiah, just before the fall of Jerusalem and the destruction of the temple. The second focuses on the Jewish community's plight in exile after the temple is destroyed.  The third section gives hope for the rebuilding of Jerusalem and the reconstruction of the temple. \n\nNetanyahu's prophecy comes from the third part, where Isaiah is prophesying about the restoration of Jerusalem and the return of God's presence to the temple.  In the current context in Israel, where people may currently feel like their situation is analogous to the Exile period, with antisemitism and oppression coming from all sides and the temple currently destroyed and replaced by an idolatrous mosque, Netanyahu is tapping in to the hope and promise that Jews relied on during exile in Babylon.  \n\nAlong with the emotional appeal to his country, Netanyahu's use of this prophesy seems to also be a reaction to the Islamic community's view of the administration of the Al-Aqsa mosque.  The controversies over the mosque were used as justification by Hamas for starting the 10/7 attacks, as many Muslims feel that Israeli settlers and government are [dishonoring the mosque in many ways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Aqsa#Conflicts).  That is the narrative that is most present in western media.  Netanyahu is emphasizing a Jewish perspective of this conflict by tying in these prophecies to current events.  Many jewish people feel that they also have a historic right to worship on the Temple Mount, but currently that is not possible.  Without saying it explicitly, Netanyahu seems to be endorsing the rebuilding of the temple.  I have a feeling that many people in Israel and elsewhere have been \"radicalized\" by the 10/7 attacks and now feel more connection to the temple and that Netanyahu is tapping in to shift in perception on the issue.",

The exercise demonstrated the modularity and lethality of Littoral Combat Ships and the ability to successfully integrate a containerized weapons system to engage a surface target. The exercise will inform continued testing, evaluation and integration of containerized weapons systems on afloat platforms.*\n\nUSS Savannah (LCS 28) was previously spotted sailing out of San Diego with a MK 70 Payload Delivery System (PDS) on its flight deck. USNI News was the first to inquire about the presence of the system on the ship and what the Navy\u2019s plans were for the USS Savannah and the system on its flight deck.\n\n*\u201cUSS Savannah (LCS-28) will participate in a live-fire demonstration during the fourth quarter of 2023 that will include a containerized launching system. More information will be provided after the evolution is complete,\u201d Naval Surface Forces spokesperson Cmdr. Arlo Abrahamson said in a statement to USNI News.*\n\nAs previously reported by Naval News, Washington has been moving fast to field ground-launched long-range missiles, most of these covering ranges that were previously prohibited under the now-dead Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. The treaty prohibited the signatories from having ground-launched missiles with ranges of between 500 and 5,500 kilometers. Following the demise of the treaty in 2019, the US has been moving fast to re-introduce missiles that cover those ranges.\n\nThe MK 70 PDS is a launcher system for these missiles. The system has four strike-length MK.41 VLS cells housed in a 12 meter (40 ft) container. The MK 70 PDS is produced by Lockheed Martin and was first unveiled in September 2021 following the launch of an SM-6 by the USV Ranger using the system.\n\nAlthough the system has been primarily tested with the SM-6s, it is compatible with every missile currently integrated into the MK.41 VLS, including the 1,200-mile (1,600 km) range Tomahawk Land Attack Missile and its variants.",

The exercise demonstrated the modularity and lethality of Littoral Combat Ships and the ability to successfully integrate a containerized weapons system to engage a surface target. The exercise will inform continued testing, evaluation and integration of containerized weapons systems on afloat platforms.</em></p>\n\n<p>USS Savannah (LCS 28) was previously spotted sailing out of San Diego with a MK 70 Payload Delivery System (PDS) on its flight deck. USNI News was the first to inquire about the presence of the system on the ship and what the Navy\u2019s plans were for the USS Savannah and the system on its flight deck.</p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cUSS Savannah (LCS-28) will participate in a live-fire demonstration during the fourth quarter of 2023 that will include a containerized launching system. More information will be provided after the evolution is complete,\u201d Naval Surface Forces spokesperson Cmdr. Arlo Abrahamson said in a statement to USNI News.</em></p>\n\n<p>As previously reported by Naval News, Washington has been moving fast to field ground-launched long-range missiles, most of these covering ranges that were previously prohibited under the now-dead Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. The treaty prohibited the signatories from having ground-launched missiles with ranges of between 500 and 5,500 kilometers. Following the demise of the treaty in 2019, the US has been moving fast to re-introduce missiles that cover those ranges.</p>\n\n<p>The MK 70 PDS is a launcher system for these missiles. The system has four strike-length MK.41 VLS cells housed in a 12 meter (40 ft) container. The MK 70 PDS is produced by Lockheed Martin and was first unveiled in September 2021 following the launch of an SM-6 by the USV Ranger using the system.</p>\n\n<p>Although the system has been primarily tested with the SM-6s, it is compatible with every missile currently integrated into the MK.41 VLS, including the 1,200-mile (1,600 km) range Tomahawk Land Attack Missile and its variants.</p>\n</div>",

We're not even there yet with production, sadly. Second, the majority of shells in Ukraine are from Western storage and bought from other countries to backfill. Third, this doesn't account for DPICM, which Ukraine recieved a lot of (but still an unknown number, IIRC).\n\nThe boring answer IMO is that we simply don't know the situation of how many shells Ukraine currently has, both normal shells and DPICM. Of course having unlimited shells (and barrels) would help immensenly in Avdiivka, since shell supply is the most important factor in the war, but you can't reduce the situation in Avdiivka to \"just fire more shells\". We don't have clear answer here either: we don't know if it's shells, manpower, leadership, rotations, other equipment or whatever.

We&#39;re not even there yet with production, sadly. Second, the majority of shells in Ukraine are from Western storage and bought from other countries to backfill. Third, this doesn&#39;t account for DPICM, which Ukraine recieved a lot of (but still an unknown number, IIRC).</p>\n\n<p>The boring answer IMO is that we simply don&#39;t know the situation of how many shells Ukraine currently has, both normal shells and DPICM. Of course having unlimited shells (and barrels) would help immensenly in Avdiivka, since shell supply is the most important factor in the war, but you can&#39;t reduce the situation in Avdiivka to &quot;just fire more shells&quot;. We don&#39;t have clear answer here either: we don&#39;t know if it&#39;s shells, manpower, leadership, rotations, other equipment or whatever.

Not sure what a \"big ground operation\" would entail in comparison, much less if one's to be expected. I know it isn't entirely comparable but just for a precedent: between Israel's air campaign late in 2008 and the ground operations commencing right at the start of '09 there was hardly a week. After 9/11 even the gargantuan, multilateral, supercomplex Afghanistan campaign was put together basically in a matter of weeks, and that implied a theater spanning a huge country, on the other side of the planet. There are not many forces in the world better trained or prepared than Israel's? And if it's still them who needed more time, why would a delay come down to US/external pressure?\n\nTime helps both sides (i.e. also Hamas). Apart from that I'd worry less about complications on the military than on the political level. With each day now it'll get more difficult--politically--to get it done, get anything done. Not least because there's development and other things happening all the time. And with each day I'm getting less convinced we're about to see anything much different than perhaps a locally \\*very\\* restricted incursion, more raids, temporary missions, searches. Or really the bare minimum now necessary even to make what went before not look like mere bluffing; and, much more devastatingly, the massive bombings up to now like a basically haphazard, planless, pointless gut-reaction. Horrible. The reasons for the delay, whatever they are, are not easily explained away with the military. They are political as usual, internal as external, and although my standpoint won't be popular I'm afraid it's in a sense already too late. They've lost momentum. This is not a clean \"war\" in the traditional sense, it's messy, we're talking anti-terror! Against terrorism strike fast and decisively, or don't strike at all. But then at least brace yourself for the next barbarian attack, as it is certain to come. What to me looks like a terrible mistake I'd never blame Israel for, instead what I think I see is just how much easier it is to stop a country like them, compared to the US like after 9/11. If the international cacophony back then could've derailed and pressured the US in a similar way, we would now have to put up with Al-Qaeda on top of all that, if not even worry how besides Iran that dictator in Baghdad might react, exploit.",

Prior to the war, Zelensky was very open to negotiating and tried to keep peace talks alive, but Russia repeatedly rejected it, calling Ukraine a vassal state, saying the leadership in Kyiv was senseless, all the while banging the drums of war. Zelensky was forced into his \"all or nothing\" approach, and any other \"regime\" will be in the same boat, only without all the goodwill and credibility that Zelensky has with Western partners.\n\nAnd lastly, the fact that elections are supposedly such a big deal to people like Tucker should tell you all you need to know. Tucker is *not* Ukraine's friend, and that's putting it lightly. If elections were held tomorrow, you'd see these people on Friday crowing about the banning of Medvedchuk's party or how half the country didn't vote or if all else fails, they'd just call the elections rigged. There's zero reason to do what these people are asking for - they'll never be placated and will only stop talking about Ukraine when Russian tanks are rolling through Kyiv. Aid is still flowing in, and I haven't seen actual Western leaders calling for elections, so Ukraine should just keep at it.
