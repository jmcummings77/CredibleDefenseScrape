Whereas Russian sources claim that \"only\" 20 tanks were involved in the attack.\n\nA part of these vehicles were destroyed or abandoned, as it's evident from [these geolocations](https://twitter.com/giK1893/status/1774399692085895350) (which include several Ukrainian losses). \n\nKriegsforscher wrote that the unit involved in the attack is the 6th Tank Regiment of the 90th Tank Division, which Russian sources already reported as being active in Tonenke for a couple of weeks. It supports the 1st Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps and other minor units of the 1st Corps and regiments of the Territorial Forces in the attacks from Tonenke. On the Ukrainian side there are elements of the 25th Airborne Brigade as well as the 53rd Mechanized Brigade.\n\nYesterday a Russian T-90M had been destroyed and [geolocated](https://twitter.com/giK1893/status/1774205749108805748) along the fourth \"longitudinal\" forest belt to the west of Tonenke, around 2 kms west of the farm buildings in the western part of Tonenke that were captured around 10 days ago. Russian sources claim they had advanced up to the fifth forest belt during the assault but had to retreat and weren't able to occupy any position along that forest belt. In general, the Russians are aggressively trying to advance, with some success. https://t. me/motopatriot/21144\n\nFurther north, the attack actions of the 114th Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps in Semenivka keep going on, in the western bank of the Durna. Yesterday, in connection with the discussion of a few days ago here about this matter, a video was published by the \"Poisk in UA\" Telegram channel and then [translated](https://twitter.com/wartranslated/status/1774030242467786885) by Dmitri from WarTranslated, showing yet another case of grievance by soldiers transferred to the 114th Brigade: in this case, by men of the 98th Rifle Regiment of the 1st Corps - I believe it's one of the regiments of the mobilization reserve which are used as marching units to replenish manpower elsewhere: their company was transferred to the 114th Motorized Brigade. Their refusal to participate in additional attacks in Orlivka and in Semenivka resulted in the surviving members of the company being charged with desertion. It also looks like that the Coke Plant became an important Russian staging area for their attacks to the west.\n\nMoreover, the 41st Army, recently reinforced by the 137th Motorized Brigade (also known as the 137th Assault Brigade per some Russian sources), continues its attack actions against both Semenivka and Berdychi, together with subunits of the 90th Tank Division and with support from the 3rd and the 24th Spetsnaz GRU Brigades. \n\n[Happy Easter for those who celebrate]",

But at the time it was hard to know if there was an alternative to Russian style tactics which would result in lower attrition. Ideas and capabilities had to be tested.</p>\n\n<p>They&#39;re better off having preserved some of their Western armor than they would be if they threw it all away. In theory there are defensive uses for armored units, although it&#39;s hard to know for sure how they will work out in this war.</p>\n\n<p>Once it became apparent that armored attacks weren&#39;t going to work, it was also probably reasonable for them to try small scale infantry attacks, although it does seem like they should have stopped a lot earlier if they knew they were going to have manpower shortages. </p>\n\n<p>Admitting that they can&#39;t attack is a big step for Ukraine as it means that some of their territory is likely gone for good, so I can&#39;t blame them for testing out different options to try and attack, although I agree that it may have gone on for too long.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I can&#39;t help but think that Ukraine might have been even more cautious about taking losses if they had known that the U.S. was going to abandon them. There is a difference between expending stuff that will be replaced and expending the only 30 tanks you&#39;re going to get.</p>\n</div>",

As war-gaming exercises continued in December, the cost of the operation became clearer to the ARCENT. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The XVIII Airborne Corps was very concerned with chemical weapons. There were real doubts that soldiers and marines could operate in a hostile environment clad in chemical warfare garments. Units were expected to undergo NBC training before being deployed exactly because the fear factor was so high during the planning phase of ODS which led to the inflated casualty estimates.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "We have some confirmation of the effect of two weeks of renewed Russian missile strikes on energy infrastructure - a bit less than a quarter (~3/8? In any case, around 2 GW) of Ukrainian power generating capacity offline, with repairs taking up to 18 months.\n\n[Reuters: Ukraine power firm hit by Russian attacks warns repairs could take 18 months, Mar 31, 2024](https://archive.is/fIZdy):\n\n> KYIV, March 30 (Reuters) - The head of Ukraine's largest private energy firm, DTEK, said on Saturday that five of its six plants had been damaged or destroyed with 80% of its generating capacity lost after two weeks of Russian attacks and that repairs could take up to 18 months.\n\nDTEK provides around a quarter of generating capacity for Ukraine.\n\nHe seems to be specifically highlighting the strikes on March 22 and March 29 as doing a large amount of damage throughout the country.\n\nEither way, the calculus is a bit different this time around compared to the previous infrastructure campaign:\n\nMost of the damage was done to facilities that had repairs finished from the damage inflicted in previous infrastructure strike campaign relatively recently, and given that the lengthy repairs would cost an additional ~$450 million, one might make an argument of how prudent it is to invest all that time and money just for Russians to undo it in 2 weeks time - of course, that is an argument we will be hearing almost certainly. \n\nImporting electricity from EU is also a bit shaky now in the context of *replacing* that lost capacity - existing interconnection lines apparently support only up to ~1.7 GW, and out of that ~1.5 GW is already used as a consequence of these attacks (previously it was at ~0.5 GW). There's always the possibility of adding new interconnection lines, but that takes time as well.\n\nIn short, if Russia is able to continue these attacks with the same intensity, in the short term it seems like they could do a significant amount of damage to the Ukrainian power generating capacity.

Bartholomew</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A lot of the media reports were either misinformed, just plain wrong or exagerated, and the JAMA study was highly flawed.    </p>\n\n<p>The Active Denial System is not a relevant system in this discussion, you don&#39;t think US intelligence would be able to track down the huge vans with the associated equipment? They are also short range for the effect to actually work very well, again, physics. They say they can &quot;work&quot; up to 1km away, but I don&#39;t think you&#39;d get much effects like we have seen in HS. It also wouldn&#39;t fit the acoustical descriptor which the <em>initial</em> cases were based on.   </p>\n\n<p>I think people should read Havana Syndrome: Mass Psychogenic Illness and the Real Story Behind the Embassy Mystery and Hysteria by Robert W. Baloh &amp; Robert E. Bartholomew before making up their minds. Again, the symptoms are just too vague and overly subjective. Who here can say they don&#39;t get headaches, earache, memory lapses, fatigue etc.</p>\n</div>",

There are numerous South Korean groups that counter North Korean disinformation, have some of the best insider scoops on what\u2019s going on inside Kim\u2019s regime and are highly credible. Should they be ignored just because they are very explicitly anti Kim? I have no idea what Financial Times did to vet this organization but dismissing it simply because they are advocating for \u201ccounter-influence strategies\u201d doesn\u2019t make sense. While my experience as a journalist extends only to working for my college paper many years ago, I am sure if you asked any managing editor of a reputable journalistic organization, or even a field reporter they will also say they are there to fight propaganda and elevate the truth.",

I don\u2019t know much about OpenMinds and their operations but nothing is truly wrong with that mission statement. There are numerous South Korean groups that counter North Korean disinformation, have some of the best insider scoops on what\u2019s going on inside Kim\u2019s regime and are highly credible. Should they be ignored just because they are very explicitly anti Kim?
