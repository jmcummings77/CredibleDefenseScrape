Without a law distinguishing between seminarians and other men of draft age, the court ruled, the country\u2019s mandatory draft laws must similarly apply to the ultra-Orthodox minority.\n\n>\tThe decision threatened to widen one of the most painful divisions in Israeli society, pitting secular Jews against the ultra-Orthodox, who say their religious study is as essential and protective as the military. It also exposed the fault lines in Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s coalition, which depends on the support of two ultra-Orthodox parties that oppose their constituents\u2019 conscription, even as other Israelis are killed and wounded in Gaza.\n\n>\tIsraeli courts have ruled against the exemption before, including Supreme Court decisions in 1998, 2012 and 2017. The top court has repeatedly warned the government that to continue the policy, it must be written into law \u2014 though that law would be subject to constitutional challenges, as previous ones were \u2014 while also giving the government time to hammer our legislation.\n\n>\tBut for seven years, since the last law was struck down, successive Israeli governments have dragged their feet in drafting new legislation. In 2023, the law finally reached its expiration date, leading the Israeli government to order the military simply not to draft the ultra-Orthodox while lawmakers worked on an exemption.\n\n>\tOn Tuesday, the court indicated that its patience had finally run out, striking down that order as illegal. It did not set a timeline for when the military must start conscripting tens of thousands of draft-age religious students.

Without a law distinguishing between seminarians and other men of draft age, the court ruled, the country\u2019s mandatory draft laws must similarly apply to the ultra-Orthodox minority.</p>\n\n<p>The decision threatened to widen one of the most painful divisions in Israeli society, pitting secular Jews against the ultra-Orthodox, who say their religious study is as essential and protective as the military. It also exposed the fault lines in Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s coalition, which depends on the support of two ultra-Orthodox parties that oppose their constituents\u2019 conscription, even as other Israelis are killed and wounded in Gaza.</p>\n\n<p>Israeli courts have ruled against the exemption before, including Supreme Court decisions in 1998, 2012 and 2017. The top court has repeatedly warned the government that to continue the policy, it must be written into law \u2014 though that law would be subject to constitutional challenges, as previous ones were \u2014 while also giving the government time to hammer our legislation.</p>\n\n<p>But for seven years, since the last law was struck down, successive Israeli governments have dragged their feet in drafting new legislation. In 2023, the law finally reached its expiration date, leading the Israeli government to order the military simply not to draft the ultra-Orthodox while lawmakers worked on an exemption.</p>\n\n<p>On Tuesday, the court indicated that its patience had finally run out, striking down that order as illegal. It did not set a timeline for when the military must start conscripting tens of thousands of draft-age religious students. Such a move would likely prove a massive logistical and political challenge, as well as be met with mass resistance by the ultra-Orthodox community.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, the ruling included a means of pressuring the ultra-Orthodox to accept the court\u2019s judgment: the suspension of millions of dollars in government subsidies given to religious schools, or yeshivas, striking a blow to revered institutions at the heart of the ultra-Orthodox community.</p>\n\n<p>The court\u2019s ruling threatens Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s fragile wartime coalition, which includes secular members who oppose the exemption and ultra-Orthodox parties that support it.

It depends on how much video bandwidth and the camera quality but it suggests to me that it should have a capability that Excalibur and GMLRS doesn&#39;t, with being able to be used without a supporting platform doing recon, which may explain its price being so high. I would imagine that if you had to compare a dedicated recon drone and a munition with minimal electronics and tried something with the ram2&#39;s range could be made much cheaper per unit.</p>\n</div>",

In an ideal world there's no need for separate ISR as you've described but I believe that in practice often multiple independent ISR platforms are used, both for target acquisition and for electromagnetic mapping to avoid jamming. The \"loitering\" aspects of the munition are used to allow it to adapt if targets reposition during flight or even attack targets on the move as well as enhancing the precision of the strike itself. Another reason for this is that when operating at the limit of the strike drone's range there's simply not enough time for it to do it's own ISR. The Russian Lancet drone for example is typically paired with Orlan drones for exactly these reasons. \n\nI think you're right that one of the major drivers of cost is good communications equipment. Maintaining contact with a ground station over long distances and with significant EW interference is a costly problem to solve however it's a necessary cost to enable these munitions to have the capabilities that they do. A drone with minimal electronics is likely much cheaper but also much less capable. \n\nExcalibur and GMLRS, while generally incapable of striking a re-positioned target, attempt to ameliorate this by getting there quickly.

GMLRS takes [\"approximately two-and-a-half minutes\"](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/tr/pdf/ADA592645.pdf) at maximum range of over 84km.

You can't mask half a million troops being airlifted into the neighbouring countries. In those 6-months, Iran would easily have the opportunity to take the final step in enriching their uranium to bomb-tier (it'd just take a couple of weeks of further enrichment), and then Iran would have a nuclear bomb to defend itself.\n\nSo functionally, there's no benefit for Iran in building a bomb today vs waiting until they see an imminent invasion and then building the bomb. Either way, the result is that they deter the invasion and protect the regime.\n\nSo can you explain to me why you think Iran building a bomb now would be better for them than waiting for when it'd be needed?",

Everyone wants to be Usain Bolt/Michael Jordan/Leo Messi.  Doesn&#39;t mean everyone with a pulse can be Usain Bolt/Michael Jordan/Leo Messi.  It was a luck of the geopolitical draw that Israel got to be the only resident nuclear power in the neighborhood but it&#39;s unreasonable to expect that it&#39;s gonna stay like that forever and try as hard as it might, Israel can&#39;t really stuff that genie back in the bottle.</p>\n</div>",
