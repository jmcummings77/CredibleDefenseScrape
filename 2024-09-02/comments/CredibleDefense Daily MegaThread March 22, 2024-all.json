As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

        "body": "A few updates on the manpower issue in Ukraine. On the problems and what is being done.\n\nIt seems that despite the significant problems, Syrsky has placed a greater emphasis on the issue of rotations, as this Lieutenant of the UAF writes. https://t. me/officer_alex33/2337\n\nThe arrival of some new brigades is reported (probably those that were in creation stage since late 2023). Rotation between brigades is not reported for now, but the usual rotation between battalions seems to be being improved. In the Orikhiv sector, where Syrsky recently promised a rotation, the bulk of the 141st Infantry Brigade and elements of the new 5th Tank Brigade have arrived in recent weeks; in Avdiivka it appears that the 101st Mech Battalion of the 61st Mechanized Brigade has also arrived near Orlivka, which means that the entire brigade is now deployed in the sector (this was the only brigade, excluding the new ones, that was entirely in the rear before February), along with elements of the 120th TDF Brigade and possibly of the 78th Air Assault Regiment. This is also due to the fact that the 3rd Assault Brigade is not entirely deployed in the front line and frequently carries out rotations among its subunits, which is one of the reasons why the brigade is so popular. Most TDF brigades are de facto broken up and their individual battalions are often sent to different sectors to enlarge the amount of manpower under the brigades deployed there or plug the holes between the latters.\n\nDigressing about TDF, a company commander of the 206th Territorial Defense Battalion of the 241st TDF Brigade of the city of Kyiv recently [complained]( https://twitter.com/R_Kulyk/status/1769068095065268279) that the entire battalion has not received a single recruit for seven months. And it\u2019s not like that they are resting in the back, they are engaged in action in the Bakhmut sector, where the unit is taking casualties. Let's be clear that this is far from being the standard in the UAF, but it pretty much is in the TDF, which relies on volunteers on a territorial basis and receives very few mobilized recruits. I had written about that in depth [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/1arevz0/comment/kqjtz51/). They were promised two dozen mobilized men as reinforcement but have recently learned that they were \"stolen\" by the Ground Forces. He also wrote that there is fear of sending their sergeants to the accelerated course (in Odesa, I think) to become officers, as it\u2019s very likely that they will then be sent to the Ground Forces. In general, I think the TDF loses thousands of servicemen per week, largely to transfers and to a lesser extent to casualties. Many members are being forcibly transferred to the Air Assault Forces (those under 35) or to the Ground Forces. The brigades that used to cover the border with Belarus (such as the 114th or 115th TDF Brigades) over the recent months have largely been sent to the eastern front and replaced by the most worn-out territorial defense battalions that spent months and months at the front. Basically today there are no battalions that have never seen the front, unlike 1+ year ago.\n\nThe theory that I have read is that the Ukrainian command wants to get the most out of the TDF in the short term until virtually all battalions have expended their combat capabilities, and at that point heavily reform the branch if not disband it altogether, with at least some of the brigades reformed into infantry brigades under the Ground Forces. It should be mentioned that some cases of cannibalism have been reported even within the latters. A proposal which circulates on Ukrainian social media, and which I hope the General Staff will consider, is to create divisions on the basis of the competent brigades, putting the less capable ones under the command of the formers and of their officers. In any case, from what I managed to read, the command is somehow working a lot behind the scenes and likely preparing a major reform of the structure of the UAF in the coming months.\n\nAs far as I read, inspectors of the MoD sent from Kyiv are reaching brigade and battalion commands. A lot of scrutiny is being done, lots of questions are being asked. Some officers are being removed. The records of every soldier are being analyzed to see how much time each one actually spent on the front lines. It\u2019s not exactly a secret, unfortunately, that in some brigades there is the practice of bribing the way out of front line service or paying commanders to get leaves. In other cases, there are healthy young men who are inexplicably assigned to roles in the rear within a brigade. Another case may be that within a battalion, there is a company favored by the commander that is always \u201ctouched\u201d less by the fighting and has the \"easiest\" duties. This whole system of preferences, when not outright corruption, seems to be beginning to be fought.\n\nMoreover, I read that 5 thousand men are being transferred from the Air Force to the Ground Forces, in addition to what I wrote about a month ago (with more than 10 thousand men previously assigned to rear services in the Ground Forces who had become infantrymen). To give a practical example, the father of an Ukrainian guy who wrote about this is getting transferred from the 40th Tactical Aviation Brigade to the 115th Mechanized Brigade, as a driver. Probably, in turn, the driver of the 115th Brigade he replaces has now become an infantryman. \n\nLet\u2019s remember, however, that there are two \"pillars\" in Ukraine: the internal one within the Armed Forces and the general, public one. Syrsky, or whoever, can affect the former, and he seems to be doing so, but the latter is up to parliament and thus to politics. Simply put: Syrsky can transfer people who are already part of the UAF, but he cannot conscript civilians into the UAF. He\u2019s a man who certainly has his flaws, but he seems to have an idea of the current priorities and what needs to be done, but politics is still far from accomplishing that. Needless to say, some politicians have already [jumped]( https://censor.net/en/news/3479766/we_dont_need_as_many_mobilized_soldiers_as_it_was_announced_shmyhal) on the wagon, taking the opportunity to say that internal reserves have been found and therefore Ukraine doesn\u2019t need the huge numbers of newly mobilized men that were initially announced. What Syrsky is doing is good, but these are still holes plugged in the short term: the medium to long term is in the hands of the Verkhovna Rada, with the mobilization law still having quite a long way to go (as far as I have read recently, though, the proposal to mobilize part of the policemen is back in vogue: we shall see).\n\nAs for the fortifications, things are getting better week by week, partially improving the poor initial situation. The officer I mentioned at the beginning reported that new fortifications have sprung up and there is a lot of work going on, including with the use of concrete (which is the responsibility of the Operational-Strategic Grouping, while woodwork is the responsibility of the Operational-Tactical Grouping), in the rear of the Avdiivka sector.\n\nAnother very important issue is that of training. So far there has been no improvement in it. I bring two concrete examples that I have read in the last few days in Ukrainian socials. Man who was mobilized in November 2023 and sent to the 23rd Mech Brigade. MIA in December near Ocheretyne (Avdiivka sector). Second case: guy mobilized in January 2024. On the 28th of the same month he began training as a stormtrooper, confident that he would be trained well. On February 25 he completed it and was immediately sent to the front in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. On March 10, local TRC employees knocked on his parents' door to report that their son was MIA and ask, as is standard procedure, to acquire samples of his DNA. Needless to write how these cases become widespread on social media and how they worsen people's opinion of Territorial Recruiting Centers, which are shunned even by volunteers (there are cases of people with a recommendation letter in order to join a certain brigade almost getting sent elsewhere). DeepState recently wrote about this. https://t. me/DeepStateUA/19046\n\nUnfortunately, within the UAF there are a lot of \"inequalities\" between brigades, in training and so on. The whole training system needs to be reformed. Many good and capable men who would make excellent trainers are at the front and refuse, out of a sense of duty, to work in that role. Some of the trainers are officers removed from frontline duty for incompetence and with little desire to do their job well. What is clear is that the standard 4 to 5 weeks of training, in which the recruit is trained in one of the Training Centers and then sent to the assigned brigade, is not enough for those who are complete novices. Unfortunately, there are many brigades that, due to lack of dedicated facilities or carelessness, get newly arrived recruits and send them straight to the front lines, and we aren't talking about TDF, which doesn't even get new recruits to begin with. Then there are well-structured, larger brigades with their own trainers, such as the 93rd Mech, which gives an additional month of in-house training to new recruits assigned to it or to new contract servicemen. DeepState also positively mentioned the 68th Jager. Which I would add, it\u2019s little known but capable brigade. Let's not even, of course, mention the 3rd Assault. There are proposals to make training last 80/90 days, but they need to be implemented. Very short and last part below.",

Another case may be that within a battalion, there is a company favored by the commander that is always \u201ctouched\u201d less by the fighting and has the &quot;easiest&quot; duties. This whole system of preferences, when not outright corruption, seems to be beginning to be fought.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, I read that 5 thousand men are being transferred from the Air Force to the Ground Forces, in addition to what I wrote about a month ago (with more than 10 thousand men previously assigned to rear services in the Ground Forces who had become infantrymen). To give a practical example, the father of an Ukrainian guy who wrote about this is getting transferred from the 40th Tactical Aviation Brigade to the 115th Mechanized Brigade, as a driver. Probably, in turn, the driver of the 115th Brigade he replaces has now become an infantryman. </p>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s remember, however, that there are two &quot;pillars&quot; in Ukraine: the internal one within the Armed Forces and the general, public one. Syrsky, or whoever, can affect the former, and he seems to be doing so, but the latter is up to parliament and thus to politics. Simply put: Syrsky can transfer people who are already part of the UAF, but he cannot conscript civilians into the UAF. He\u2019s a man who certainly has his flaws, but he seems to have an idea of the current priorities and what needs to be done, but politics is still far from accomplishing that. Needless to say, some politicians have already <a href=\"https://censor.net/en/news/3479766/we_dont_need_as_many_mobilized_soldiers_as_it_was_announced_shmyhal\">jumped</a> on the wagon, taking the opportunity to say that internal reserves have been found and therefore Ukraine doesn\u2019t need the huge numbers of newly mobilized men that were initially announced. What Syrsky is doing is good, but these are still holes plugged in the short term: the medium to long term is in the hands of the Verkhovna Rada, with the mobilization law still having quite a long way to go (as far as I have read recently, though, the proposal to mobilize part of the policemen is back in vogue: we shall see).</p>\n\n<p>As for the fortifications, things are getting better week by week, partially improving the poor initial situation. The officer I mentioned at the beginning reported that new fortifications have sprung up and there is a lot of work going on, including with the use of concrete (which is the responsibility of the Operational-Strategic Grouping, while woodwork is the responsibility of the Operational-Tactical Grouping), in the rear of the Avdiivka sector.</p>\n\n<p>Another very important issue is that of training. So far there has been no improvement in it. I bring two concrete examples that I have read in the last few days in Ukrainian socials. Man who was mobilized in November 2023 and sent to the 23rd Mech Brigade. MIA in December near Ocheretyne (Avdiivka sector). Second case: guy mobilized in January 2024. On the 28th of the same month he began training as a stormtrooper, confident that he would be trained well. On February 25 he completed it and was immediately sent to the front in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. On March 10, local TRC employees knocked on his parents&#39; door to report that their son was MIA and ask, as is standard procedure, to acquire samples of his DNA. Needless to write how these cases become widespread on social media and how they worsen people&#39;s opinion of Territorial Recruiting Centers, which are shunned even by volunteers (there are cases of people with a recommendation letter in order to join a certain brigade almost getting sent elsewhere). DeepState recently wrote about this. <a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a>. me/DeepStateUA/19046</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, within the UAF there are a lot of &quot;inequalities&quot; between brigades, in training and so on. The whole training system needs to be reformed. Many good and capable men who would make excellent trainers are at the front and refuse, out of a sense of duty, to work in that role. Some of the trainers are officers removed from frontline duty for incompetence and with little desire to do their job well. What is clear is that the standard 4 to 5 weeks of training, in which the recruit is trained in one of the Training Centers and then sent to the assigned brigade, is not enough for those who are complete novices. Unfortunately, there are many brigades that, due to lack of dedicated facilities or carelessness, get newly arrived recruits and send them straight to the front lines, and we aren&#39;t talking about TDF, which doesn&#39;t even get new recruits to begin with. Then there are well-structured, larger brigades with their own trainers, such as the 93rd Mech, which gives an additional month of in-house training to new recruits assigned to it or to new contract servicemen. DeepState also positively mentioned the 68th Jager. Which I would add, it\u2019s little known but capable brigade. Let&#39;s not even, of course, mention the 3rd Assault. There are proposals to make training last 80/90 days, but they need to be implemented. Very short and last part below.</p>\n</div>",

We are therefore acting in accordance with NATO best practices.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Details: Commenting on the Russian attack on 22 March, Stefanishyna said she expects her partners to provide Ukraine with weapons: &quot;Outrage and condolences are one thing, but we expect weapons first and foremost.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Granted this is still just an off-the-cuff response by a non-military-affiliated official.</p>\n</div>",

That's what we're trying to do. This is not something agreed upon with our friends and partners. This is what we think, but some countries are interested in these ideas. It is being discussed,\" said Veyssi\u00e8re.\"\n\nA couple of days ago, there was a discussion on here whether France was serious regarding being willing to send troops to Ukraine in some scenarious, or whether it was all just election rhetoric and scoring some free points with Eastern Europe. Like many others, I believed the latter to be most likely, with my core argument being that there were no reports that France were actively discussing a coalition with other partners. The quote of Veyssi\u00e8re apparently undermines this argument. Furthermore, if the goal of France's statements were mainly related to the European election, it is not clear why the French Ambassador to Ukraine would repeat these talking points at a relatively little publiziced forum. That is not to say that we can yet discount the possibility that France is not serious, just that this is a piece of evidence making it less likely.\n\n But this is what confuses me: What scenarios are France discussing? Sending troops in the event of a collapse of the Ukrainian frontline? That would seem to entail a direct military confrontation with Russia.\n\nSurely it would make more sense to send troops to the Ukrainian rear before the frontline collapses, as this would have a much lower risk of entailing directly joining the fight against Russia, while also having a large potential to deescalate the conflict, as the only language Russia understands apparently is will and power.\n\nOf course another possibility is that France in fact is hoping to create a coalition to send troops to Ukraine before a potential collapse of the front would be imminent, and that they are just not yet saying so openly in order to ease the shock of the public, by instead dividing it into several smaller shocks dispersed over time...

He also said China likely deployed the Navy chopper for surveillance.</p>\n\n<p>The Philippines\u2019 coast guard recently built a new surveillance base on Thitu Island \u2014 complete with radar, satellite communication, coastal cameras and automatic identification capability \u2014 to boost its capacity to monitor movements of Chinese ships.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Finally, there was rare disclosure on what&#39;s being provided to the Philippines:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-21/quad-delivers-nearly-500m-for-maritime-awareness-in-se-asia?srnd=undefined\">Quad Delivers Nearly $500M for Maritime Awareness in SE Asia</a></p>\n\n<p>The US and members of the strategic security partnership known as the Quad have delivered more than $475 million in maritime awareness to help Southeast Asian nations counter Beijing\u2019s growing presence in the South China Sea, according to a US official.</p>\n\n<p>Assistant Defense Secretary Ely Ratner said Wednesday the US is prioritizing Southeast Asian partners \u201cby diversifying the maritime platforms and systems they have to respond to incidents within their EEZs,\u201d or Exclusive Economic Zones.</p>\n\n<p>Those includes providing new commercial off-the-shelf technologies \u201cthat can rapidly strengthen partners\u2019 ability to promote safety and security within their waters,\u201d he told the House Armed Service Committee during a hearing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

I personally don&#39;t think we&#39;ll have to wait until November (or January) for <em>some sort</em> of Ukraine aid, but what an aid package may look like is anyone&#39;s guess.</p>\n</div>",

For them the meatwave tactic works.\nI get the feeling that Russia is now pushing all buttons in order to go for a killing blow, now that EU support is becoming stronger after a delay and slow increase (artillery shells) and the US still has not sidnged the required act. Wether it works remains to be seen, but curious how others look at it.</p>\n\n<p>This also might be why we get so many messages from Western leaders/generals about that the West should prepare for war. And why Macron is now willing to eventually send (non-combat) troops to Ukraine. Prevent a possible collapse? Guard Kiev against the Russians? What do you think?</p>\n</div>",

With the best systems and practices global militaries are working to get that time to seconds.\n\n[Targeting time shrinks from minutes to seconds in Army experiment  | Defense One | March 2024](https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/03/targeting-time-shrinks-minutes-seconds-army-experiment/394758/?oref=d1-homepage-top-story)\n\n*The Army is seeing a \u201ctwo orders of magnitude\u201d increase in the speed at which data is passed to weapons crews since the first Project Convergence, said Alex Miller, a senior science and technical advisor to Army Chief of Staff Randy George. In certain cases, processes that previously took minutes took just seconds, Miller said during a media day for this year's Project Convergence, one of the service\u2019s marquee technology-testing events.*\n\n*Miller said the success was due in part to simplifying procedures.*\n\n*\u201cA lot of it was just making sure we didn\u2019t over-classify things,\u201d allowing soldiers to send information to foreign partners and other services without routing data through a human, he said.*\n\n*The Army also tried a \u201ckanban\u201d-like system for targeting, which provides a shared view of information and tasks instead of the laborious system of PowerPoint slides and dashboards usually used to share targeting data, Miller added. Kanban processes are frequently used in software development to encourage collaboration.*\n\n*Systems used in the experiment were \u201cable to pass an amount of data that we had not seen before,\u201d said Lt. Gen. Ross Coffman, deputy commander of Army Futures Command.*\n\n*Miller also said the Army made use of the Tactical Intelligence Targeting Access Node (TITAN) targeting station and the Army\u2019s Aerial Reconnaissance and Targeting Exploitation Multi-Mission Intelligence System (ARTEMIS) jets. On Wednesday, the Army announced it awarded Palantir with a $178 million contract to deliver 10 TITAN prototypes.*\n\n*Project Convergence began in 2020 as a way to test experimental Army technology, from artificial intelligence to robotics. In the years since, the Army added in other services, as well as other countries, like Australia and Great Britain.*\n\n*The event also became a critical way to evaluate the technology and processes designed to quickly share data across services and between nations. The connect-everything concept and related technology is known as Combined Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or CJADC2.*\n\n*The Defense Department recently launched an initial version of the CJADC2 capability, Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks said Feb. 24. That version is now being tested at Project Convergence, which ends March 20.*\n\n*Military leaders see sharing targeting data as particularly vital in battles where all services are engaged in tracking and firing on enemy forces.*\n\n*Services and allied nations all have some form of long-range intelligence collection, and have  weapons they can use based on that intelligence. But unless they share information, multiple units could dogpile on the same target\u2014or else waste precious time determining who will fire what.*\n\n*\u201cIf we can't connect ourselves together, then we're going to build individual stovepipe plans,\u201d said Vice Adm. Michael Boyle. \u201cAnd we may end up double targeting or triple targeting.\u201d*\n\n*Data sharing will also help ensure the military doesn\u2019t waste its missiles. That has become a key consideration following a think tank analysis that shows the U.S. would struggle to produce enough long-range precision missiles for a protracted war.*\n\n*\u201cWith that common operational picture, we\u2019ve identified the one shooter so we don\u2019t waste missiles needlessly,\u201d said Coffman.*\n\n*China and Russia are also working on systems to quickly distribute intelligence to military units. China is developing a concept called Multi-Domain Precision Warfare, while Russia has dubbed its version Automated Control Systems.*\n\n*Even without advanced network-based targeting, Russian targeting can be swift and deadly, with Russian forces honing their skills over two years of intense combat in Ukraine. Thanks to their reconnaissance drones and other targeting tools, some Russian artillery crews can target Ukrainian positions within three minutes of spotting them.*\n\n*The speed of the U.S. targeting process is competitive with adversaries, Miller said. But potential adversaries have so many missiles in their stockpiles  that the U.S. must focus on knocking out enemy launchers rather than shooting individual missiles out of the air, Coffman said.*\n\n*\u201cWe need to ensure that offensive fires would defeat their capabilities on the ground, so that we're not trying to shoot things out of the air, but rather shooting them before they get into launch,\u201d Coffman said.*",

To start, you can check what the [guys actually doing the raiding have to say](https://www.newsweek.com/ukraine-insurgents-claim-russian-village-march-moscow-1878438):\n\n>Baranovsky said the nascent dual-pronged operation \"is our most ambitious operation to date, with all of the groups\u2014the Freedom of Russia Legion, the RDK, the Siberian Battalion\u2014having grown in terms of quantity and quality in recent months. For the latter, this is the first such [incursion] into Russia.\"\n\n> He went on: \"This marks a new milestone for the resistance movement, and in the coming months we will continue to set more complex goals for our missions. Hopefully, one day we will reach the main one\u2014the destruction of Putin and his regime.\"\n\nSo if we take these comments at face value, the raids are a test for the FRL - can they handle an operation of this size, what will Russia's response be.  Some kind of combination recon in force plus on the job training to see if they can get momentum going inside of Russia. This may seem delusional, but delusions abound in this war so this might be their actual, serious aim. They might genuinely believe this larger raid is a stepping stone to an even larger one sometime in the future, escalating until they get an real deal push on Moscow going.\n\nMore broadly, one wonders why Ukraine either allows or orders the FRL to mount this attack. My guess is that there's a combination of things here:\n\n1. Ukraine's overall strategy is very focused on imagery and symbols. Sievierodonetsk, Bakhmut, etc were all held well past their expiration date, likely due to political or propaganda concerns, so Ukraine has demonstrated willingness to expend significant resources for these symbolic stands that have low or negative military value. Raiding across the border right now supports no obvious operational goal, but the social media narrative that Ukraine is still fighting back is likely as important to their leadership now as it was when refusing to retreat in Bakhmut. \n\n2. Maybe the raids were hoped to be more impactful or successful, forcing Russia to pause their current offensive actions in order to handle the politically touchy problem of an incursion onto their soil. Again, it's easy to look at it now and say \"well that's delusional\" but some planner somewhere might have thought they had a chance to force Russia to redeploy. When combined with the far more significant attacks on Russian refining capacity, this narrative of degrading Russia's momentum could make sense.\n\n3. More tin foil hat, but I wonder how much control Ukraine really has over the FRL. They could be a pure propaganda entity totally controlled by Ukraine, or they could be a real deal rebel group with significant internal motivation and de facto leeway. Once they convince Ukraine to give them supplies for an operation, they could decide what it looked like, or decide when to execute it, without the full control of Ukraine's normal military command. Again, low confidence tinfoil, but once you give a few thousand angry dudes guns, tanks and fuel, sometimes they don't do exactly what you want. There's been plenty of that in this conflict since 2014.",

That's not hypothetical, it's real and happening already. \n\nAt Krynky, Russian tactical units are taking a beating, and maybe someday the Russians will have trouble replacing losses at the strategic level due to those types of campaigns. But that remains to be seen.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ukrainian tactical units are also taking a beating but that's having strategic effects because that's happening in conjunction with a nationwide manpower crisis defined by an overwhelming reluctance for the population to serve, and a chief reason for that is because they don't want to be cannon fodder. \n\nUkraine needs more willing conscript troops, especially infantry, so when there is a five month long operation where an untold number of super pissed off conscript infantry are complaining openly for being used as Meat, that's going to make their current recruitment crisis even worse. And THAT can cost them the war.\n\nThis is the very reason that most of the credible people following this war are recommending the Ukrainians go on the strategic defensive. That means not doing costly, stupid meatgrinder campaigns, it means sitting in absurdly defended bunkers to stay warm and as safe as possible, because that signals to the population that their lives won't be thrown away stupidly.

That&#39;s not hypothetical, it&#39;s real and happening already. </p>\n\n<p>At Krynky, Russian tactical units are taking a beating, and maybe someday the Russians will have trouble replacing losses at the strategic level due to those types of campaigns. But that remains to be seen.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the Ukrainian tactical units are also taking a beating but that&#39;s having strategic effects because that&#39;s happening in conjunction with a nationwide manpower crisis defined by an overwhelming reluctance for the population to serve, and a chief reason for that is because they don&#39;t want to be cannon fodder. </p>\n\n<p>Ukraine needs more willing conscript troops, especially infantry, so when there is a five month long operation where an untold number of super pissed off conscript infantry are complaining openly for being used as Meat, that&#39;s going to make their current recruitment crisis even worse. And THAT can cost them the war.</p>\n\n<p>This is the very reason that most of the credible people following this war are recommending the Ukrainians go on the strategic defensive. That means not doing costly, stupid meatgrinder campaigns, it means sitting in absurdly defended bunkers to stay warm and as safe as possible, because that signals to the population that their lives won&#39;t be thrown away stupidly.

They'll have \\~6 months of great weather to try to knock the Ukrainians out before the fall mud season starts and things slow down again. They will need to keep the pressure as high as possible, try to break the back of the UAF so they commit their strategic reserve (which has largely been committed already), force heavily attrited UAF units to remain on the line to fight regardless of their losses because there is no other choice to both hurt morale and ultimately lower unit combat effectiveness, etc. \n\nBut I have no idea how the Russians would plan and execute that strategic offensive, as they tend to do things a bit...irrationally. \n\nThey should be focused on an attritional campaign, especially now that the UAF are \"on the ropes\" so-to-speak regarding their manpower crisis. However, the Russians seem to ruthlessly pursue a politically driven territory-centric focus, aggressively trying to take ground, which needlessly increases their own losses, especially when tied to pressure from senior leadership placed on the lower tactical commanders to make progress quickly, which forces them to take unnecessary and poorly thought out risks hoping for success. \n\nIf the senior Russian leadership backed off the pressure, they could engineer campaigns to still force the UAF to fight up front in their typical \"hold at all cost\" positional defenses, often outside of suitably prepared defenses\\*, and that could be used to destroy the UAF before they can find a solution for their manpower crisis and actually fix it. Like Verdun or Krynky, but on a strategic scale. Attack just enough to bait the UAF to mass forward, then use fires to wipe them out. \n\nBut the Russians probably won't do that. They'll probably do what they've always done: attack with elan, ruthlessly aggressive, taking huge losses in the process because they underestimate the UAF as much as the latter does too, and while they probably will succeed in taking ground and hurting the UAF more, the Russians will hemorrhage manpower and material losses in the process. Enough to cause strategic problems? It all comes down to how well they fight vs the UAF. \n\nThe upcoming danger for Russia in comparison to the last \\~six months or so is that the UAF are going to be flush with artillery ammo thanks to the Czech Group Buy. With supposedly \\~1.5 million rounds at their disposal this spring-summer the UAF are going to be able to dramatically increase fire rates, no more rationing at all. If the Russians fight stupidly, they're going to bleed terribly because of that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Like Russia's Surovikin Line, the UAF can't actually build large-scale defensive fortifications, accompanying obstacles, and extensive minefields near the present front lines, especially not in \"hot\" sectors. \n\nThey'll need to be built outside of common artillery and drone range for the survivability of the construction crews who are working out in the open during daylight hours and aren't meant to get annihilated in the process. \n\nOnly in quiet sectors, where the Russians aren't regularly attacking, probing, conducting aggressive drone-directed Recon Fires, can the Ukrainians even really hope to beef up their current positions, where infantry defenders and military engineers able to work on improving their positions. However, there is limit to that. They will have trouble \"reseeding\" minefields in No Man's Land. They'll be unable to move construction equipment like excavators or backhoe loaders and use them, it'll be too dangerous. Wont be able to use cranes to drop in pre-fab reinforced concrete bunkers, or to pour concrete themselves. Etc. So there is a major limit to how well built the existing forward positions can be or those immediately behind them. \n\nWHERE the better defenses are located will especially be a concern. Good defenses only work if they're manned, and they can only be manned if the UAF are allowed to retreat into them after they're built. \n\nWhich means either voluntarily giving up \\~10 kilometers or more of the existing front line space for about 1,000 kilometers of the front. That'll mean losing most of the Donbas and all sorts of other areas they're currently defending at all costs. Not only would that be a dangerous political call to make for the future, but it would be in total opposition of the existing UA leadership's approach to war, which is not to give up a single centimeter of ground unless forced out. \n\nHold at all costs has been the order of the day since the start of the war, I seriously doubt it's going to change now. So like the extensive defense in depth the Russians built in Zapo Oblast last year and then didn't use, instead electing to fight a forward defense around Robotyne, the UAF are very much likely NOT to use any extensive fortification network they've been working on for the last few months. They're going to fight from their existing positions at every opportunity, which aren't very good. \n\nThe other way to man the better and more distant prepared defensive fortifications is to involuntarily retreat to them, which is more likely, and necessary. Looking at past battles where quality fallback positions weren't really available, like Popasna, Bakhmut, Avdiivka, etc, the UAF were forced to retreat but didn't have the ability to immediately occupy quality defensive positions because they didn't build them first. With quality defenses built ahead of time to the rear on good ground, if the UAF are involuntarily forced to retreat this spring-summer then the further back they go the better the defenses. Theoretically, because a lot of those defenses aren't built yet, especially in great depth.",

Except that couldn't have been further from the truth.\n\nFrom the peace accords of 1996 until 1999, Chechnya was a lawless de facto state that was immediately thrown into a civil war between secular nationalists and Islamists. The theoretical central government had so little control over the situation that its primary economic bases were kidnappings and stolen goods. Attempts to mechanize the oil industry there was met with kidnappings of oil workers. It was an absolute mess and you bet your ass contraband was rife in the area, especially as hardcore Islamists from the Arab World began building connections with sympathetic local militias.\n\nNo, the Second Chechen War wasn't \"illegal\", and can't really be compared to the current invasion of Ukraine, because Chechnya never enjoyed the legal right to secede as an independent nation unlike Ukraine did under the Soviet constitution. You can dislike that as much as you want, but international demarcations are far from universally accepted or consistent, especially since Chechnya was an unrecognized nation. Chechnya can't even claim partial recognition like Kosovo or Taiwan or backing from a foreign benefactor like the so-called Donbass PRs.\n\nLet me present some counter questions - why would the FSB deem it necessary to incur millions of dollars in damages in a country barely recovering from a deep recession? Was the Islamist invasion of Dagestan in August 1999 not enough justification? Why would Russia not invade Chechnya when it was apparent that it was a serious threat to security?\n\nThe problem with the Litvienko conspiracy theories is that it tries to rationalize an inherently irrational action - terrorism. Extremists and their actions are inherently irrational and based on nonsensical ideas. The Birmingham Church bombings, 9/11, the El Paso terrorist attack, 1999 Russian apartment bombings, and 7/10 are all inherently irrational actions motivated by hate. You don't need a deep conspiracy to explain them. Islamists hate Russia/the USSR and wanted to further destabilize it and \"liberate\" the Muslim ethnic groups. If al-Qaeda can execute 9/11, then extremist Chechens were more than capable of the massive attacks that struck Russia in September 1999.\n\nAgain, this narrative mostly comes from the Litivenko book and from the so-called Chechen government in exile thar never exercised much authority over its claimed territory to begin with. Alexey Pivovarov made a great documentary on the subject in 2021 and even shows footage from the spring of 2000 of a talk show that debated whether the FSB had responsibility in the attacks. Russia still had relative democratic freedoms during this time so it wasn't a very uncommon opinion. He even interviews FSB personnel that worked on those nights. There are a few AskHistorians threads on the events too which give answers that support both Litivenko's view and the FSB account.\n\nThis narrative also relies too much on a telelogical view of events, that events are inevitable and follow a pattern. In reality this is hindsight bias. Russia may have never invaded Ukraine if Euromaidan faltered and it became more like Belarus, which was more than plausible.\n\nIt's a narrative that shouldn't be repeated uncritically but at least it has some circumstantial evidence - it's better than the even worse \"Ukraine should have kept its nukes!\" talking point that even gets regurgitated by Kyiv to guilt trip the West for more aid. No kids, Ukraine couldn't keep its nukes even if it wanted to.",
