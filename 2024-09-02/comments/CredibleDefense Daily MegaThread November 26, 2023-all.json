Finance: Russia's worker shortage is so bad the economy is leaning on the Soviet-era practice of using prison labor, think tank says, Nov 23 2023](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/russias-worker-shortage-bad-economy-210524767.html?guccounter=1)\n\n> Russia's worker shortage is so bad, the nation is increasingly leaning on prison labor to prop up its ailing industries and make up for a lack of manpower.\n\n> In 2022, Russia pulled in an estimated 19.1 billion rubles, or around $204 million from forced prison labor, The Moscow Times recently reported, citing dating from Russia's finance ministry. That exceeded estimates that Russia made the year prior, when budget makers anticipated bringing in just 15.8 billion roubles from forced prison labor.\n\nRybar, Nov 26 2023, in full (t. me/rybar/54497):\n\n> \ud83c\uddf0\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udf17 About relocants and labor shortages\n\n> Yesterday, the speaker of the State Duma of the Russian Federation, Vyacheslav Volodin, expressed a completely logical position regarding Russian citizens who left Russia after the start of a special operation in Ukraine. He noted that some of them did not find a place for themselves abroad and returned to their homeland, but they should not expect only a warm welcome here.\n\n> \ud83d\udccc **The speaker\u2019s words reflect the harsh reality: Russia has a serious problem of shortage of qualified labor.** Some people went to work in Europe, where they pay more, while others ran away from the special operation, relocating to the near abroad.\n\n> The first wave left the country back in February-March, and the second - with the beginning of the mobilization process, frightened by the illegal actions of military commissars, who actually swept everyone indiscriminately under the same broom, which began to create unnecessary chaos and a personnel hole inside Russia.\n\n> Currently, some of those who left the country have begun to come back. And their gradual return to Russia (those that have not violated the legislation of the Russian Federation) is beneficial, since it will have a positive impact on the labor market, which has become considerably thinner since the beginning of the SVO.\n\n> **This problem must be solved by creating normal living conditions in the country - in general and for work - in particular. So far, the number of people returning to the country is catastrophically small, because the gap from Western countries in providing a comfortable environment and high salaries is still large.**\n\n> **Our authorities should play, as they say, the long game, gradually establishing and improving this area and, in the future, hoping for an influx of qualified personnel back into the country.*\n\n> \ud83d\udccc **But, unfortunately, this has not yet been observed.** Quite clumsy methods are being taken to achieve the goal. For example, in Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan (only here for now) the practice of visa-run was abolished, according to which foreigners could stay in the country as long as they wanted, only periodically traveling abroad for a couple of hours and returning back.\n\n> This was done in order to put pressure on the relocants and force them to go to Russia. Only this caused an insignificant effect. People either sit in Kyrgyzstan, negotiating a residence permit, or travel from country to country, living here and there.\n\n> **And another problem arose related to the arriving \u201cspecialists\u201d from the CIS countries due to the failed migration policy. The number of incidents has increased, which is not surprising. They were already involved in crime before, and now they are also being helped in this with benefits and indulgences.**\n\n> **\u2757\ufe0fAnd the other day information appeared that the management of Russian Railways plans to hire previously convicted and migrants to work for the company. If this happens, it is not difficult to predict the reaction of the population, which is already on the verge of an explosion.**\n\n> In some cities, people's militias have long appeared due to the arbitrariness of migrants and the inaction of the authorities. And many combatants returned from the Northern Military District. For them, a conventional \u201ccop\u201d with a pistol (and often without it) after the conventional Rabotino and Avdievka is not perceived as a threat. And in the absence of systemic changes, everything will only get worse. And everything will come to the point that a crowd of millions of dissatisfied citizens will definitely knock on the door of the officials who promoted the open door policy.\n\n> This situation creates unnecessary tension in society, which will benefit the \u201cWestern partners\u201d, and not only them. It is worth remembering how the crowd in Dagestan reacted to one small injection from Ukrainian resources. And in this case, the disaster will certainly develop into something completely uncontrollable.\n#Kazakhstan #Kyrgyzstan #multinationalism #Russia\n@rybar\n\nI wouldn't be so quick to dismiss the 'marginal, almost inconsequential' emigration from Russia, nor underestimate just how unpopular the 'Convicts will solve everything' approach might be with the Russian population (too bad they aren't being asked for their opinion on anything really).",

To counter artillery is called counterbattery.\n\nFun fact, the M270 MLRS, with its DPICM  rockets, weren't created to stop human wave attacks, they were designed to take out enemy arty and air defenses without needing to rely on air strikes. \n\nDuring the attack, some fires try to destroy enemy defensive positions, while others just try to suppress them. Other fires go after enemy fires. Other fires go after enemy command, control, communications. Other fires might specifically perform harassment and interdiction fires on potential supply lines, assembly areas, etc. And some fires help obscure the battlefield with smoke. \n\nThe key is to mass fires. The goal is to have the most weapon systems covering the shortest frontage to fire with lots of ammo for short but extremely violent fire missions. Longer fires often isn't better because it eliminates surprise. Suppression is cheaper and often more realistic than destruction fire missions (making them duck, not die), but requires tight coordination with maneuver units; the shorter the time between lifting the suppressive fire and the assault starting, the more likely the assault succeeds.\n\nIn the initial assault on Robotyne by the 47th Brigade, one of the assault companies that got absolutely manhandled by the Russians was late making its attack, attacked after daylight with its artillery support having stopped firing four hours before.",

Comes out to about 110k. \n\nBut realistically, most of the platoons aren't close to full strength, especially if they're actually fighting. \n\nThen there are definitely entire brigades and battalions not anywhere close to the front line, in the rear areas, maybe even outside Ukraine. \n\nAnd most brigades that are on the line are regularly rotating out companies or battalions for R&R because they can't rotate out brigades, so at any given time probably 1/4 of any brigade is in the rear. \n\nThen some infantry units are in local  reserves, so also not in the line (ideally, 1/3 of any unit should be kept back \n\nAnd when they are on stationed on the line, most units are staged in some level of depth. S a company might have a reinforced platoon strongpoint with another platoon broken up in front spread out on outpost duties at the squad level. \n\nBecause of the overall frontage width, and that defensive positions are probably never less than a squad, and that platoon or company strongpoints are very much terrain dependent, that's likely why a company is said to cover upwards of 3 kilometers. If that's not enough and the sector is hot (like around Avdiivka) the UAF brass rush more troops there and the frontages shrink.\n\nThe idea that the Ukrainians are deliberately thinning the line and it's not about too few tactical units is largely is coming from RUSI courtesy of Jack Watling, who has been trying to claim that's the result of dispersion to avoid ISR and fires that are typically part of the close fight. \n\nBut he's pushing that because he's part of a British land warfare ideology clique that has been GREATLY obsessed with dispersion for quite a bit of time actually. Watling has written quite a bit about it before this war, like [here](https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/rusi-defence-systems/relearning-art-proactive-defence?fbclid=IwAR2rnzp3A03pu6LFVM87rA8tLkCD8v9YnVCf3pQ7CUMad_32FWivd9eRrkk) and  [here](https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/occasional-papers/strike-concept-force), this is like Air Power and Strategic Bombing to the modern British Army and their defense industry writing about it.

Or that they are highly mobile? Or that they take communication and electronic spectrum security very seriously? If not, the idea that they have to thin out their lines to hide them better in greater space is pretty pointless when they're building blatantly obvious defensive positions that they don't leave unless pushed out, because they don't use mobility for defense. While having pretty terrible comms security because so much of their tactical radios aren't secure. Actual dispersal tactics are supposed to utilize top level camouflage, mobility, and communication/electronic spectrum security and discipline so they can remain hidden, none of which the Ukrainians regularly do.\n\nBut Watling is looking to validate his and his peers' preconceived theory about the future of warfare, to go into published RUSI articles and [his newly published book on the future of warfare](https://a.co/d/7GBdRYq), which is pretty much all about the tactical advantage of dispersion.

Both were doing fixed and rotary wing loft bombing and indirect rocket attacks. Both are using glide bombs against each other&#39;s front line units. Not are using deep strike ground to ground PGMs tactically. While Russia isn&#39;t using very long range Shaheds tactically, they are using Lancets, a shorter range drone. Both are regularly targeting each other&#39;s supply depots, assembly areas, C3, massed gatherings including celebrations, etc.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>So what&#39;s the US military answer to this problem? Air support and long range strike capabilities. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The US answer is a better coordinated and performed air campaign, along with a better coordinated and performed ground campaign.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sure precise artillery fire is bad but it&#39;s not as bad if you can drop 2000lb JDAMs on the enemy artillery battery. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Ukrainians literally are dropping JDAM bombs regularly. Even better, they have the JDAM-ER versions. Unfortunately, performance is degraded because the Russians can jam GPS. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Russian / soviet tanks are simply not made for 2000s battlefields.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Neither were nearly every NATO and especially all US Army IFV and tanks.
