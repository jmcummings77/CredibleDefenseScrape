        "body": "I predict that the next (US) Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff will be General Charles Q. Brown Jr.\n\nThe current Chairman is General Mark A. Milley. Milley started his term as Chairman in October 2019. A chairman's term is four years. Prior to his appointment, he served on the JCS as Chief of Staff of the Army, a position he occupied from August 2015 to August 2019, or exactly four years, the term length of the position. Milley's term will end in September 2023, seven months from now.\n\nTraditionally, the chairmanship is rotated between the services. Milley is from the Army. His predecessors, in descending order, were from the Marines, the Army, the Navy, the Marines, the Air Force, the Army, and again the Army. The Secretary of Defense during the last transition, Jim Mattis, a former Commandant of the Marine Corps and JCS member himself, was preparing then Air Force Chief of Staff General Dave Goldstein to assume the next chairmanship, but Trump took a personal liking to Milley and put him forward instead. Thus it's likely that the next chairman will neither be from the Army nor the Marines, which leaves the Navy, Air Force, and Space Force.\n\nThe Chief of Space Operations, General B. Chance Saltzman, is, in my view, unlikely to be the next chairman because he only rose to his current position in November 2022, which would leave him less than a year on the job. Although a previous chairman, General Martin Dempsey, served as Army COS for only five months before being appointed chairman. But this was mostly due to the fact that \"the vice-chairman, Marine General James Cartwright, who was initially believed to be the front runner for the job, had fallen out of favor among senior officials in the Defense Department.\" (Wikipedia) Saltzman is also only 53 years old, which is another reason I believe he won't become chairman in 2023. White House officials might think he is too young to assume such an important job for now (being Chairman is a terminal position in one's career), but there may be an opening for him in 2027.\n\nOn the Navy side, there are two candidates: the vice-chairman, Admiral Christopher W. Grady, and the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Michael M. Gilday. Grady started his term in December 2021, which would leave him less than two years on the job before being chairman. And Gilday began his term in August 2019, about the same time as Milley, which would allow him to complete his full four-year term as CNO.\n\nAnd on the Air Force side, there is one candidate: General Charles Q. Brown Jr. Brown is the current Air Force COS and started his term in August 2020, which would leave him 3 years on the job before beginning a term as chairman.\n\nThe US military imposes a mandatory retirement age of 64 for all its officers. Grady and Gilday were born only a month apart and will turn 61 at about the same time as they would begin a four year term as chairman, which would give them three years on the job before they reach 64. Brown was born in 1962 but the exact date is unknown. If he becomes the next chairman, he would reach 64 in 2026, 3 years into the job, like Grady and Gilday. But the law provides exceptions to the mandatory retirement age for military officers.\n\n(a) General Rule.\u2014Unless retired or separated earlier, each regular commissioned officer of the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps serving in a general or flag officer grade shall be retired on the first day of the month following the month in which the officer becomes 64 years of age.\n\n(b) Exception for Officers Serving in O\u20139 and O\u201310 Positions.\u2014In the case of an officer serving in a position that carries a grade above major general or rear admiral, the retirement under subsection (a) of that officer may be deferred\u2014\n\n(1) by the President, but such a deferment may not extend beyond the first day of the month following the month in which the officer becomes 68 years of age; or\n\n(2) by the Secretary of Defense, but such a deferment may not extend beyond the first day of the month following the month in which the officer becomes 66 years of age.\n\nSo the president or the SecDef could grant a deferment of one year to allow one of these men to serve their last full year as chairman.\n\nGiven all of the above, I predict that General Brown will be the next chairman for one final reason: the current chairman should have been a USAF officer, and the last time a USAF officer served as chairman was 18 years ago. The Biden White House being a stickler for tradition, I assume that they will resume the conventional rotation of the position between the branches for the 2023 transition. As a bonus point, Brown is the former commander of the Pacific Air Forces. The Pacific Ocean is the main theater of operations for the US military now and for the future, so appointing a former PACAF Commander as CJCS would send a strong message that the US continues to make the Pacific a top priority and help reassure allies and partners in the region.",

Running the Russian army alone is a full-time job that they all hate (or should).

Mind you, this was before Excalibur arty, before HIMARS existed and when M270 MLRS were limited in the number of GMLRS that didn't still use cluster munitions.

The manner in which they spread out forces in Afghanistan was essentially criminal, for example the highly dangerous Regional Command East, hugging Pakistan so being the major rat line to their safe haven, was about the size of Pennsylvania but only had a division's worth of troops, manning 120 COPs manned by 150 platoon sized maneuver elements, which meant most COPs were only platoon sized. The idea was to spread artillery out so company or battalion sized FOBs had one artillery piece assigned, but it was only the very large Forward Operating Base that would get a full battery to support it. Most COPs had a single 120mm mortar assigned for dedicated fire support and needed to call on another COP often a dozen kilometers away to get a single artillery piece to fire in support. \n\nExcept if there were any helicopters or fixed wing operating in the area, then artillery was usually denied due to complex fires de-confliction that happened at Bagram and was slow as fuck (hence why fire missions took so long to process, the request for fire had to be transmitted to Bagram air cell to ensure the area was clear of aircraft so no aircraft accidentally flew into an arty round midair). \n\nFYI, the whole reason the US Army has had precision guided arty and GMLRS rockets since the early 2000s, and even precision guided ballistic missile (ATACMS), and why Precision Strike Missile is being developed to replace ATACMS, is because air power was never supposed to replace artillery for tactical support of ground forces. \n\nThat was never supposed to be the case, air support would assist with CAS but artillery was supposed to do most of the support, by doctrine, with a mix of HE and especially HEAVY use of cluster munitions used in artillery ammo, MLRS rockets, and ATACMS missiles. Even early GMLRS and precision guided ATACMS were still just supposed to more accurately dump cluster munitions on a target, because that was how the US Army envisioned warfare in the 90s. During the early GWOT when airstrikes dramatically surpassed surface to surface weapons with precision, and cluster munitions couldn't/wouldn't be used as doctrine had called for, then steps were taken to correct it, which is why the US Army's PGM arsenal is now quite impressive, far surpassing anyone else.

Sure enough, the Soviet Union did have their own version of the VT/proximity fuze, though they call it something else, I can't remember. So where is it? My guess is, for the sake of logistics, they don't issue them, every fuze is their super quick impact or delay two in one like ours, whereas their VT fuzes are probably sitting in a warehouse in Siberia.\n\nFor Ukraine, I have seen a few airburst rounds but not many. Note, I no longer look at combat videos but if I see one labeled airburst I do watch just to try to get some details. But considering how much 105 and 155 we've given them and we definitely gave them the fuzes, and how often they're firing on dismounts in the open or open top trenches, I just don't get it. VT/proximity should be half their fire missions. \n\nThey're also issued US 60mm, 81mm and 120mm mortars, and they share a fuze that does quick, delay, and two proximity settings all in one, so no excuse, they literally just need to turn it. \n\nSo weird.\n\nThey also almost never use smoke, neither mortars, arty, or even popping them from AFV while being engaged, and that's just strange. Western AFV pop smoke as SOP just to move positions after firing and the Russians and Ukrainians don't pop smoke while being actively ambushed during many minutes long engagements.\n\nAnd their camo sucks. Not the uniforms (though don't get me started on that fucking tape), but they don't really put any effort into putting up camo netting properly like [this](https://media.defense.gov/2017/Apr/25/2001737504/-1/-1/0/170421-F-JZ560-033.JPG), they don't turn all their tanks and IFV into [this](https://rare-gallery.com/uploads/posts/106644-leopard-2a6-tank-camo-german-army.jpg), don't camouflage fighting positions and especially trenches like [this](https://www.stripes.com/incoming/rln098-1-23-22-russia-ukraine-front-lines/alternates/LANDSCAPE_910/1-23-22%20russia%20ukraine%20front%20lines) or [this](https://cdn-japantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/np_file_129858.jpeg), which are both Ukrainians trenches so obviously some know to do that. This is the first major drone war, they're getting pulverized by heavy fire missions when spotted, and they're not even taking the basic countermeasures that were done in the 40-70s to mitigate against attack aircraft whose pilots saw far worse than drone operators. \n\nThis war should be putting the Vietnamese to shame in entrenching, tunneling, and camouflage but instead both sides are just a step ahead of the Iraqi Army in Kuwait.",

That works great until it doesn&#39;t, and it rarely has in history.</p>\n\n<p>Bakhmut was supposed to go like Vulhedar, months of fruitless and extremely costly Russian attacks and in the end the lines don&#39;t move, just lots of dead Russians, destroyed equipment they can&#39;t replace easily or at all, and the Ukrainians come out like military badasses. </p>\n\n<p>But that&#39;s not what happened, it was still very costly for the Russians but it was also very costly to the Ukrainians too, and the lines still moved a lot despite every effort by the Ukrainians to &quot;hold at all cost,&quot; showing the limitations of that strategy, especially in the face of Russian tactics and operational capabilities.</p>\n</div>",

Picture Monty in WW2, the king of set piece battles. The more time they have to plan, the slower things move, the better they'll do. The Ukrainians preferring positional defenses makes the Russian's job easier.\n\nAdditionally, Russia is a fires centric army. The joke is that they're an artillery army with tanks, they have quite a bit more than the Ukrainians, who themselves have 3x more than the US Army, just to put that in perspective. The key to dealing with an opponent with lots of fires is to remain hidden, disperse, or move especially, to not be where the artillery lands. Imagine fighting a heavy weight boxer with no endurance but a hell of a right hook, stick and move, don't get hit is preferable to remain right in front and trading punches.\n\nThat said, Russians aren't good enough and the Ukrainians aren't bad enough that the Russians can always exploit their strengths and succeed. Ukrainians are tough, they're motivated, they're not incompetent in the defense, and they do have pretty decent weaponry, ISR, comms, etc. If nothing else they can still make the Russians pay dearly for advancing, which seems to favor a strategy of attrition. And other times, like in Avdiivka or Vulhedar, they don't budge and end up handing the Russians their ass. \n\n>Like they might be messing up severely by doing frontal assaults in Vuhledar\n\nIn positional war there are only frontal assaults. For example, how would they attack the unguarded flanks of Vulhedar? They'd first need to frontally break through a position next to the town and then try to outflank it, similar to how they are outflanking Bakhmut by going around it primarily, though both pincers are still conducting frontal assaults. \n\n>but if they can count on Ukrainians never moving until it\u2019s almost too late, eventually they\u2019ll learn to find some weak spot to the east or west and get around the town so they can hit the supply routes or assault it from multiple sides.\n\nThey're doing exactly that in Bakhmut.\n\nEven at the tactical level they're bypassing the villages and towns that the UAF strongholds seem to be based on and going after the rural field works/trench works, which are easier to find (they're not camouflaged, easily visible by drone), easier to suppress, neutralize, or destroy with fires, easier to assault than urban areas.\n\nThe problem for the Russians is that small differences elsewhere means they can't replicate it. For instance, the defenses they're fighting over in Bakhmut are NOT where the Ukrainians planned to defend months ago, they're all hastily built and often poorly sited in terms of terrain features. Compare that to Avdiivka or Marinka, where the lives haven't moved in half a year or more. Compare that to Vulhedar where there is a giant field that's a kilometer deep that the Russians need to cross to reach the town and its defenses. \"Hold at all costs\" works at those places because the cost to the Ukrainians is pretty low, the cost to the Russians is extremely high, who have had no success even in limited tactical breakthroughs. It's those successes that are causing the losses at places like Popasna, Severodonetsk, Bakhmut, etc, they're letting them go to their heads and not realizing blanket policies are a bad idea.",

Both sides used them during the American Civil War, and the US Navy used blimps to hunt Nazi submarines during World War II. But the development of airplanes and high-altitude spy planes made lighter-than-air craft seem quaint, and the US Navy retired its last airship in 1962.\n\n>In time new technology would bring balloons back around. In the late 1990s, NASA started testing superpressure or ultra long duration balloons (ULDBs) that could stay aloft in the stratosphere for months at a time. Thanks to new high-strength polymers, the craft could carry payloads weighing thousands of pounds to heights above 100,000 feet.\n\n>In 2012, Google hired Aerostar to build ULDBs for Project Loon, a fleet of dozens of stratospheric balloons that provide internet connectivity to remote areas. By pumping air into or out of a smaller balloon within the outer envelope, the Loon ULDBs could rise or sink as needed to catch winds moving in a desired direction. That meant they could go (more or less) where they wanted to and remain (more or less) over a given target area.\n\n>Aerostar\u2019s current model, called Thunderhead, brings the same technology to reconnaissance and surveillance missions. \u201cI can keep it in an area for weeks at a time without interruption,\u201d says Van Der Werff. From their launchpad in South Dakota, Aerostar\u2019s solar-powered balloons can find their way to anywhere in the world; the longest flight to date lasted 150 days.\n\n>To understand how useful performance like this can be, consider the alternatives. Low-Earth-orbit satellites whiz along at 17,500 mph about 150 miles above the ground, meaning that they can cover the whole surface of the Earth but only stay over a particular target for a matter of minutes. \u201cThe value of the intelligence you collect goes up exponentially with the loiter time,\u201d says Arthur Holland Michel, author of the book Eyes in the Sky, about high-altitude surveillance. \u201cIf you can hang out over an adversary\u2019s sensitive facility for days, you\u2019re able to see temporal patterns\u2014where people go, how they move, what sort of schedules they have.\u201d\n\n>Geosynchronous satellites are good at maintaining a steady gaze, as they\u2019re permanently fixed above a certain spot on the globe. The problem is that they\u2019re 22,000 miles up\u2014too far to get a detailed look at things.\n\n>Then there are airplanes. These can get to an area of interest quickly and remain on station over a specific spot. But their endurance is limited and you can\u2019t fly them through hostile airspace. \u201cThe US has quite a lot of experience in flying not over a country, but sort of along its borders and looking diagonally to the territory,\u201d Michel says. But that approach is pretty useless when it comes to a big country like China, Russia or the US.\n\n>Stratospheric balloons can overcome many of these problems. Because they fly higher than planes and are mostly made of material that\u2019s transparent to radar, they\u2019re much harder to spot when they slip over the borders of unfriendly countries. \u201cThe radar cross-sectional area of the balloon is very low,\u201d says David Stupples, a professor of electronic engineering at the University of London who specializes in space-based surveillance. What Stupples is saying essentially is that from the perspective of a radar antenna, the balloon is very small and hence difficult to detect.\n\n>And balloons move more slowly, on the order of 40 to 50 mph, which is actually an advantage when it comes to avoiding detection. \u201cAir defense radars are looking for fast-moving metal aircraft,\u201d Stupples explains. Because the velocity of a target changes the frequency of the returned signal, radar operators can filter out slow-moving targets like rainstorms and flocks of birds by ignoring everything with a small frequency change. But doing so also filters out balloons. \u201cSomething slow is going to get lost in the clutter,\u201d he says.\n\n>If a country suddenly decides it wants to detect high-altitude balloon systems\u2014as the US apparently has\u2014then it needs to look at everything with a small frequency change and try to pick out potential targets from amid a great deal of noise. That means a lot of false positives. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any evidence that there has been a sudden increase in the number of objects in the sky,\u201d said President Joe Biden in a speech about the balloon shoot-down on Feb. 16. \u201cWe\u2019re now just seeing more of them, partially because the steps we\u2019ve taken to increase our radars\u2014to narrow our radars.\u201d\n\n>Because they\u2019re unmanned, high-altitude balloons are more or less expendable. Even if one is detected and shot down, there isn\u2019t going to be an international incident on the scale of earlier ones involving spy planes, such as when the Soviets captured U-2 pilot Gary Powers in 1960, or when the Chinese seized a US surveillance plane in 2001. \u201cYes, China\u2019s balloon sparked an international incident,\u201d Michel says, \u201cbut it does not even come close to what would have happened if China flew a human-crewed jet over the US.\u201d\n\n>Having an aircraft that can get closer to its target than a satellite may have been especially important to China, if it was trying to sniff out America\u2019s newest secure communications technology. This technology, called LPI/LPD, or \u201clow probability of intercept/detection,\u201d works by transmitting at very low power so that a signal is deliberately lost against background noise.\n\n>Ultimately, the one advantage of stratospheric balloons that could really change the game is cost. \u201cWe have to brace ourselves for the fact that this is going to become an increasingly available technology available to friends and foes alike,\u201d says Michel, adding: \u201cStates and nonstate actors alike.\u201d\n\n>\u201cWhat you\u2019ve done is, you\u2019ve brought signals intelligence to the midrank countries of the world,\u201d Stupples says.\n\n>Between that and all the recent free publicity, the odds just got a lot better that a high-altitude spy balloon could be coming your way soon. You probably won\u2019t realize it, though.",

Even if one is detected and shot down, there isn\u2019t going to be an international incident on the scale of earlier ones involving spy planes, such as when the Soviets captured U-2 pilot Gary Powers in 1960, or when the Chinese seized a US surveillance plane in 2001. \u201cYes, China\u2019s balloon sparked an international incident,\u201d Michel says, \u201cbut it does not even come close to what would have happened if China flew a human-crewed jet over the US.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Having an aircraft that can get closer to its target than a satellite may have been especially important to China, if it was trying to sniff out America\u2019s newest secure communications technology. This technology, called LPI/LPD, or \u201clow probability of intercept/detection,\u201d works by transmitting at very low power so that a signal is deliberately lost against background noise.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, the one advantage of stratospheric balloons that could really change the game is cost. \u201cWe have to brace ourselves for the fact that this is going to become an increasingly available technology available to friends and foes alike,\u201d says Michel, adding: \u201cStates and nonstate actors alike.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat you\u2019ve done is, you\u2019ve brought signals intelligence to the midrank countries of the world,\u201d Stupples says.</p>\n\n<p>Between that and all the recent free publicity, the odds just got a lot better that a high-altitude spy balloon could be coming your way soon. You probably won\u2019t realize it, though.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Knowing about the Russian plan to invade definitely isn't, so we can ignore those dates.\n\nIn terms of an actual timeline of when refurbished Abrams were possible, let's set some ground rules. \n\nFirst, western tanks weren't even being seriously asked for until into the fall, when the reality that this war was definitely not going to end in 2022 set in. \n\nSecond, nobody was going to give them western tanks that take half a year or more to become proficient on, with the logistical nightmare that follows, when we can unload COMBLOC tanks from various NATO members that can be used near instantly because the Ukrainians know how to use and fix them already (that included over 300 tanks given in 2022). \n\nThird, Ukraine isn't even short of tanks at all; Micheal Kofman who went to Ukraine said they have lots of COMBLOC types, their worry is long term ammo and that they can't get help from NATO with maintenance. So much of this discussion on tanks is a total waste, it's not what they actually need, which are IFV (they're actually low on those) and cluster munitions (which would help a lot). \n\nSo let's reset the clock it to October '22, when the conversation for western MBTs became serious for the first time. That was four months ago, so let's go from there.\n\nPoland and Australia both have ongoing orders for Lima refurb Abrams that amounts to about ~300 tanks; and unlike Ukraine they're actually paying for their tanks and everything else. On top of that, there are ~100 the US Army is waiting on to get upgraded for itself (the whole force is supposed to have SepV3 but doesn't). \n\nMind you, Lima can only pump out about 150 a year at its current pace, which doesn't increase unless Congress passes a major spending bill, which means more than just notes on a napkin.\n\nSo Ukraine is at the bottom of the queue. Do we tell Poland, Australia, and the US Army to fuck off? Sure, pro-Ukraine online supporters are probably very okay with that answer but it's not going to happen, that's not the world we live in. \n\nBut let's say all three agree to get limit their delivery so Ukraine can be prioritized. So out of a ~150 or so a year Ukraine gets 1/3, so 50 Abrams, a battalion. \n\nThey get them in September 2023, just in time for the wet season. And it's only a battalion, their next battalion doesn't arrive until 2024. That's still nothing, that's a symbolic gesture and nothing else. \n\nWhich is the issue. AFAIK, minus the unaccounted USMC Abrams, there is no short term solution for combat ready tanks that doesn't involve stripping one or more of the US Army Prepositioned Stocks bare, which means a dramatic decrease in strategic military readiness, which is extremely problematic.There is the same problem with Bradleys too. \n\nWhen Ukraine wasn't ready for this war, NATO bailed them out, primarily the US. Who's going to bail out the US if we screw up and don't have the forces needed to fight multiple wars at the same time (a strategic necessity due to US being superpower)?\n\nIf there is nothing else this war taught everyone it's that nobody planned to have enough equipment and ammunition stockpiled. \n\nOverall, I want the Ukrainians to get Abrams, as long as the way is sustainable and responsible. I'd also prefer they pay for them, but that's a different story. But I think the plan should be realistic, which means many hundreds of tanks over the course of many years, minimum of 4-5 years, to try to convert a large part of the Ukrainian Ground Forces over to western equipment (there is no way in hell all of it converts unless it drastically shrinks).",

Poor planning.\n\nIt wasn't poor planning, nobody actually had a clue how this war was going to go, not enough for a commitment that would cost the US far more than they've given and amount to a 4-5 year contract utterly free to the Ukrainians. Because that's what we're talking about, Ukrainians getting the second largest tank fleet of the best and most expensive tanks in the world for free. \n\nAnd frankly, if Ukraine didn't score a big win over the fall there was a good chance they were going to lose long term support. \n\nPlus, there were still plenty of T-72 and other COMBLOC tanks sitting around Europe that could be unloaded to Ukraine. \n\n>What happens if you don't plan ahead and wait till the lack of tanks is felt on the battlefield?\n\nThen that country fucked up, bad. And hopefully people learn from Ukraine and try not to emulate them. \n\n>It's the same story that we had with artillery ammunition production expansion, did the US really have to wait almost a year before paying for expanding facilities when napkin math even a couple of weeks into the invasion would have predicted the need?\n\nBecause napkin math can say anything, and so can a Reddit post. Why can't we colonize Mars? Why can't we end homelessness? Why can't we cure cancer? All redeeming posts that show how compassionate and thought provoking I am and not worth a napkin to write on, and equally useless as suggesting the US to dump billions to turn the UAF into the US Army no later than summer 2023.\n\n>Europe is in even worse situation, far worse, they can't even get their shit together to make ammunition factories run 3 shift apperantly.\n\nBecause, they can't just raid their neighboring lands and then force the slaves to work in the factories. To get just a second shift requires lots of money to pay the workforce, who need to be recruited and trained. Additionally they have to pay for supply chain, logistics, and admin expansion. And nobody is doing anything until iron clad contracts are signed. And nobody is signing anything until lots of money is made available for the foreseeable future, not just this fiscal year alone, because that's a terrible investment.\n\n>If Ukraine is on dife need of IFV's and it takes 4-5 months to traing up a fresh formation, then we should have started deliveries and training 4-5 months ago, and not waited till the need became acute (not an excuse for 3 weeks training of course).\n\nIt wasn't like AFV were ignored, Ukraine has been getting them regularly for a year. They just weren't getting the best in the world for free. For lots of reasons. \n\n>Honestly I still don't really understand the US and western European strategy in Ukraine.\n\n1). Don't start WW3 \n2). Preserve Ukrainian sovereignty\n3). Help Ukraine regain territory lost in this war (not Crimea)\n4). Weaken Russia militarily to lessen their effectiveness as a threat \n\n>Would you agree that it's mostly reactionary?\n\nYep. And it's not going to stop, that's just the way proxy wars work. Especially ones as screwed up as this one. \n\nThe very idea of doing what you're talking about literally means going to a war economy for free, over Ukraine. That's not how proxy wars work, especially ones that nobody wants to exist other than the defense industry and Ukraine, so they can liberate everything and get reparations and get Putin in shackles or whatever they'll actually settle for to end the war. \n\nIt's why the US and other Western countries keep talking about negotiations, they want this war to end ASAP. They can't wait for it to end and they're terrified of the idea that it only ends with UAF physically liberating their country by force. \n\n>such as crawling increase of Chinese support for the Russian war effort\n\nAs if that wasn't always a threat. A battalion of M1 Abrams wasn't going to change that. If anything, it would make it worse.

        "body": "As we near the anniversary of the invasion, I'd like to reflect on some lessons learned from the conflict and offer some general observations.\n\nFirst, the power of satellite imagery. In my view, there were two types of people working media/intel during the winter of 21-22: the ones who watched satellite footage, and the ones who didn't. If you didn't see Twitter Rob Lee's or Kofman's et al round-ups, the Feb 24th invasion came as a huge shock. Sure, the Biden administration was saying an invasion was inevitable, but that prediction was coming on the heels of the Afghanistan fiasco. There were many doubters that an invasion was about to happen. \n\nBut then, if you spent any time looking at satellite imagery, you quickly came to a very different conclusion. Russia was pulling armored units from all over the country, all pointed towards Ukraine. Such redeployment was very costly and totally illogical outside of an invasion scenario. I remember seeing all those parked tanks and helicopters and thinking, 'This is going to happen'. And sure enough, it did. If there's any longterm lesson, it is that any mass troop movements are impossible to conceal in today's modern world. Obviously, more mobile militias like the Taliban can still shock, but when it comes to a modern army, there is no hiding from US and NATO satellites.\n\nFor me personally, I think it was early January when I was convinced. Russia was still mid-assembly at that point, but based on both the imagery and the expert commentary, you could quite credibly conclude that a Russian invasion was about to happen. After that: it was a period of waiting. I remember staying up this time last year to watch a new day dawn in Kyiv each morning to see if the livestreams would capture the shock and awe that would come.\n\nThat's the second observation: Russia blundered, perhaps fatally, in the initial invasion. The prediction of a 3 day invasion and collapse of Ukraine was baked into everyone's predictions. As we all know, Russia failed, but it's important to keep in mind how chaotic those first few days were. You had the first Russians cross the border from Crimea (captured on a CCTV). Russian special forces performing an airport capture. Russian troops (later, we found out they were little more than police units) in the heart of Kharkiv! On a map, the Russian advance looked impressive: a mass seizure of territory, the encirclement of Sumy, and the continual push of Russian forces onwards. Of course, those were all illusory gains. The Russian army surged forward, expecting no resistance, and when resistance was met, they simply tried to avoid it--to the point they had captured empty strips of road connecting towns and cities but little else in the North. Easy pickings for defenders armed with anti-tank missiles.\n\nOver the next month, we saw tragedy turn to farce, from the tank traffic jam to the north of Kyiv, to the radiation poisoning of Russia's own troops in Chernobyl--and back to tragedy again (Bucha etc.). We also saw the air campaign falter and fail completely. Instead of shock and awe, as everyone expected, we got a whimper and a tucked-tail as Ukrainian air defenses made quick work of enemy fight jets. It took Russia until fall to truly begin hammering Ukrainian infrastructure, by which point, any infrastructure destruction would neither shock nor awe.\n\nThere is a tripartite takeaway to this phase of the war. First, it was a Ukrainian victory. Ukraine did make plenty of blunders in the early hours (due to high levels of confusion), losing Kherson and some other towns in the South, but after the 3rd day, the nation effectively rallied and halted or slowed the Russian offensives down considerably. Ukraine deserves much of the credit for this. The 2014 army that first faced down the Russian onslaught was long gone by 2022--replaced by an effective, trained, and motivated fighting force. While it was still deficient in terms of modern equipment, they were more than a match for Russian units, men for men.\n\nSecond, by surviving, Ukraine ensured Western support. America had committed to funding another insurgent army to be based in Ukraine. Think Afghanistan during the 80s (which hopefully would not end up becoming our enemy 15 years from now)--lots of anti-tank and anti-air shoulder-fired munitions, but nothing close to HIMARs. With the survival of the Ukrainian state guaranteed, this allowed for much greater and better material support to flow to Ukraine. Instead of arming a new Mujahideen, we were arming a still-existing nation-state--huge difference.\n\nThird, this was a Russian defeat. In hindsight, most military campaigns are decided long before the first shot is fired in anger. If you boil warfare down to an economic calculation, plus movements of opportunity (to destroy enemy army formations and occupy territory), the war was lost years ago. Russia never had a chance to economically beat a NATO-armed Ukraine, much like Germany never had a chance to beat a US-armed USSR. Their only hope was a quick knockout affair--the movement of opportunity, seizing Kyiv and Kharkiv and bottling a rump Ukrainian state in the far west. As that failed, further US support became inevitable, and Russia's own abilities downgraded. Russia might have had some success had they more narrowly focused on Kharkiv instead of Kyiv, but even then: they had no chance of knocking out Ukraine in a single blow, and they should've known that before embarking on this fool's crusade.\n\nIn hindsight, therefore, the Russian 3 day strategy was doomed to failure, as is their present strategy to out-attrite the Ukrainian army. As Kofman recently said, Ukraine will have supply issues for the next 6-8 months, but should the line hold steady, then after, Russia will be continually out-produced by new Western suppliers.\n\nOf course, Russia has enough men and material to keep the war going for many years. To go back to WW2, Germany had effectively lost the war during the winter of 1941-2. Their only hope to match America's production was to turn the Soviet Union into a giant enslaved arms factory. By failing to capture Moscow and Leningrad, Germany had lost the war. Of course, if hindsight were foresight, wars would never happen; it still took them until May of 1945 to actually capitulate.\n\nMy final reflection is to concur with Putin on one point (this is educated guesswork about his plans): Russia's best hope is a diplomatic and political coup. In war, you can blunder perhaps twice before such blunders earn you total defeat--but in politics, you can blunder infinitely yet succeed permanently. Here, I turn again to history. Frederick the Great's deliverance from total defeat during the 3rd Silesian War in the mid 1700s came by a diplomatic revolution in Russia, as Prussophile Peter III ascended to the throne and completely overturned Russian foreign policy and aligned instead with Prussia, despite Prussia being at the mercy of the Russian army. Had Peter not ascended, even for a few more months, Prussia would have had a much different history. \n\nThe same could be said of Nazi Germany. Soviet and British victory required US support. Had the US elected an isolationist in 32, 36, or 40, Europe may as well have become a Nazi colonial empire.\n\nIn this political-diplomatic sphere, Putin has blundered, again and again. You of course have the cold plan, where high energy prices conspired to freeze Europe this winter, which would lead to protests, riots, maybe even political revolution. That failed to materialize, thanks in large part to a warmer than usual winter. That so much was riding on weather patterns tells you a lot of Putin's thinking.\n\nHis best hope for a long-term shot of victory is still a Peter III-like diplomatic revolution in Europe or America. This is not implausible. Trump, who is running again, has already stated that he would ensure peace returned--very likely via cutting off the arms pipeline to Ukraine and thus forcing Kyiv to concede mass amounts of territory in return for peace. Many other Republicans express a similar desire (e.g. DeSantis). The Republicans who want more commitment to Ukraine (the neocons) are an endangered breed and very far from any chance of winning the presidency. And lest we think the status quo can hold forever: Trump won once before.\n\nAnd while the economy is trending positive, thus forestalling any Eurozone collapse, the EU is still in a dangerous spot should there be a major war in the Middle East or China. In the former, Iranian and Israeli hostility is practically inevitable, considering the political leadership of both countries and Iran's near-procurement of a nuke. And of course, there is Taiwan. A war in either or worse, both would cripple the EU's economy and give Russia an opening to win the conflict by shutting off EU support for Ukraine (America too, would be too distracted in those instances to maintain the same level of support).\n\nThis doesn't mean that Russia will stop offensives in waiting for better conditions. As long as they can, they'll continue to attack and degrade Ukrainian forces in the hopes that Western support will dry up thanks to changes diplomatically.\n\nThe very worst case scenario for Putin is no Eurozone recession and a continued President Biden/Harris for the next 5 years. In that case, US support for Ukraine will balloon, and it is only a matter of time before Russia is totally defeated in the field (absent the use of nuclear weapons). Only Chinese support of Russia, like America's support of Ukraine, would save the Russian army in that case. \n\nIn sum, after a year of war, we can say Ukraine is trending to victory. If the lines can be held for only a year more, with no distractions happening elsewhere in the world, Ukraine will win the war in 5 years' time, assuming Russia does not seek an earlier peace. If the Ukrainian defense falters, or if the West gets distracted, that job will become far more difficult, though not impossible.",

Those positional battles have involved some back and forth exchanges of territory, which may give the impression that they are pushing to take those cities, but mostly that's just an elastic defense (ie the Ukrainians give up a position under pressure and then retake it later after attriting the Russians while they are over extended) or probing or spoiling attacks on the Russian lines that aren't intended to gain any territory. \n\nSo yes, you could say the offensive is stalled, but I think that implies the Ukrainians are running out of steam.

The geniuses on the Russian side of course reached the opposite conclusion and decided to pursue offensives during each of the three mud seasons since they first invaded last year (although the fall and spring mud seasons are blurring together because of the warm winter, so maybe it's more accurate to say both of the mud seasons since Feb. 2022).
