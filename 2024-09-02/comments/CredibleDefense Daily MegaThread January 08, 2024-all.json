Tactically speaking, it's about the most advantageous to Ukraine present anywhere along the river, with high ground on the West bank and poor access routes on the East bank that are easy to scout.\n\n* That doesn't mean it's a \"good\" position to defend.  The river makes extractions and supply difficult, obviously.  And getting across the river in the first place is much easier than crossing back to the Ukrainian side.  Talks about the logistics of extracting wounded.  Says that realistically, they probably aren't able to extract that many wounded, which is very bad for morale.  In short: \"you can see where you need to go.  If you don't get there, you will die.  But you can't get there\".  And the guys who are there are basically there to be bait.\n\n* Russian losses are very high. Ukrainian losses are very high.  It's an explicit trade of Ukrainian manpower for enormous quantities of Russian armor, and some relatively \"elite\" units (actual quality of those units nonwithstanding).  The units involved on the Russian side are typically VDV or Marines.  Says Russia has lost at least 40-50 armored vehicles (that he has geolocated), but probably closer to 100 (hasn't geolocated all of the footage he has), and perhaps as many as 150 armored vehicles there, setting aside pickup trucks and logistics vehicles.  \n\n* Is it worth it?  It's hard to say. He thinks Krynky is likely to be looked back on more favorably later on than it is now.  It is legitimately holding up a lot of Russian resources that are being spent banging their head against a piece of their own land so to speak, instead of assaulting in the east and northeast.",

Krynky is a garbage  position to defend, troops there are in a major tactical disadvantage, which means it limits their effectiveness, so they'll suffer more casualties and inflict fewer enemy losses than in a better position elsewhere. \n\nThe only UAF units who have it good as part of the Krynky operation are those on the western bank who aren't the ones getting slaughtered, recon fire complex units using drones for ISTAR or FPV direct strike, who are using the Marines as bait to hit the Russians attacking them. And they can do that anywhere and score just as many kills wherever the Russians are massed. \n\nEven the claims of holding the high ground make no sense. The UAF Marines on the waters edge on the eastern side are in the low ground, basically dug into a destroyed town, in low numbers, very poorly supplied relying on a terrible cross river supply line that is being heavily interdicted. Mention was made last year about the interdicted supply lines leading to Bakhmut and what that caused in terms of very delayed casualty evacuation and resupply issues, and Bakhmut doesn't hold a candle to Krynky. At a minimum they could probably create a mountain of the gangenous limbs they amputated thanks to that delay, not even considering how many WIA turned into KIA because a simple CASEVAC got turned into a 1-2 day affair. \n\nMeanwhile, those providing fires for them aren't supporting the Marines, its the other way around. Again, the Marines are just bait for the units doing drone directed arty and FPV drones from the high ground on the other side of the river, who don't need elevation to find or hit targets since drones aren't limited by the height of the terrain. And their biggest threats are Russian drone directed arty/airstrikes and FPV drones, who won't either be limited by sight because the Ukrainians are a few meters higher on the western bank. \n\nI can't think of why the UAF kill ratio math can't be replicated elsewhere better anywhere other than because of something extremely unique about the Kherson Oblast sector, like the Russians there are just really stupid especially their top leadership (unlikely considering one of the best Russian generals is leading that fight), or the Russians could actually better counter the UAF recon fires units at a place like Avdiivka, whereas Maygare Birds are safer in Kherson because it's clearly not the Russian main effort. \n\n>Ofcourse that means the Ukrainian troops in Kherson right now would also be moved somewhere else so maybe its a mute point.\n\nThis is the key part. The Russians can attack somewhere else, but the Ukrainians can defend somewhere else too. Where are the positions and supply lines less screwed up for the front line troops, Avdiivka or Krynky?

I've studied warfare longer than many on this board has been alive and this operation always screamed high risk and now we're seeing what happens when they won't retreat. \n\nIn a tactical sense, the eastern bank is a death trap for the Ukrainians. They're not on high ground, they're in low ground. They'll never be adequately supplied, never adequately reinforced, never adequately evacuated when wounded. Most of the parts of the city they hold have been leveled by fires, so they don't have good cover and concealment or shelter, which is a big deal in the winter and when their biggest threat is Russian drones spotting them. The same recon fire complex tactic being used against the approaching Russians is being used by the Russians against the UAF troops on the eastern bank, and there is nothing they can do to stop it. We know this because the troops themselves are routinely breaking OPSEC in hugely dangerous way to describe their plight, and I don't blame them because they are being used similarly to how Russia uses convicts.\n\nMore so, they have no hope of pushing out further and establishing a deeper bridgehead that might improve their position, mainly because their own chain of command isn't bothering because they're bait to draw Russian counterattacks for the Ukrainian recon fire complex units to attack in a poorly though out kill ratio campaign done in the middle of a major manpower crisis. \n\nThe elevation doesn't even matter when the drones are doing all the work for finding targets for UAF arty or doing FPV strikes, drones don't need high ground to operate they create it by flying. \n\nThere are limited avenues of approach ALL OVER UKRAINE that can channelize the Russians into kill zones to be exploited by recon fires. Plus it's winter, where the off-roading isn't next to impossible due to mud there is an ever present mine threat. Even without that, the Russians would still be channelized on their approaches the same as the Ukrainians were around Robotyne, which is nothing like the Dnieper River and yet still a target rich environment for Russian drone directed recon fires. \n\nWhat I'm saying is the \"elite\" UAF FPV drone units operating on the West bank of the Dnieper, who aren't in danger, can go just about anywhere in Ukraine and rack up just as an impressive kill claims without needing to use UAF troops as bait fighting from truly awful positions.\n\n>Russia's total inability to destroy the position despite all of the challenges of holding it speaks to *something*.\n\nNo it doesn't, because this sector is clearly not important for any sort of strategy to win the war by retaking a portion of a small town on the edge of a river the Ukrainians can't otherwise cross in strength. It's a side show. \n\nEven the Maygar drone guys are saying the Russians are half assing it and deliberately denying that regional operational group command the assets they need because it's not the main effort. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/6tvxOse1Kck?si=8laaIJtarn1tGqCR\n\nWhere is the current Russian strategic main effort? In the Donbas. Where are they massed? In the Donbas. Where are they taking ground? In the Donbas. Where is the premier UAF drone unit? Not in the Donbas. Where are the Ukrainians utterly wasting lives of a finite number of troops they might need in more important areas? Not the Donbas. \n\nFurthermore, those UAF troops on the eastern side of the river aren't just human beings, they are the worst forms of anti-recruitment material imaginable because their plight is well known in a country that is rapidly losing faith in the war effort. Which has far more strategic consequences than Russian AFV losses around Krynky. The Ukrainians couldn't ever afford to be doing stupid shit like this, definitely not now. \n\nRead [this article by Jack Watling](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/ukraine/war-ukraine-not-stalemate). I don't fully agree with everything he writes but his recommendations are largely sound. Ukraine needs to be focusing on preserving its forces, rebuilding, training, getting better at warfare for a later date when legit offensives might be possible. And part of that requires major manpower solutions that cannot occur if the UAF actively use up their troops in an extremely callous and visible manner. I don't care if their kill ratio math is favorable and nobody else should either, spreadsheets don't win wars.",

Plus it&#39;s winter, where the off-roading isn&#39;t next to impossible due to mud there is an ever present mine threat. Even without that, the Russians would still be channelized on their approaches the same as the Ukrainians were around Robotyne, which is nothing like the Dnieper River and yet still a target rich environment for Russian drone directed recon fires. </p>\n\n<p>What I&#39;m saying is the &quot;elite&quot; UAF FPV drone units operating on the West bank of the Dnieper, who aren&#39;t in danger, can go just about anywhere in Ukraine and rack up just as an impressive kill claims without needing to use UAF troops as bait fighting from truly awful positions.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Russia&#39;s total inability to destroy the position despite all of the challenges of holding it speaks to <em>something</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>No it doesn&#39;t, because this sector is clearly not important for any sort of strategy to win the war by retaking a portion of a small town on the edge of a river the Ukrainians can&#39;t otherwise cross in strength. It&#39;s a side show. </p>\n\n<p>Even the Maygar drone guys are saying the Russians are half assing it and deliberately denying that regional operational group command the assets they need because it&#39;s not the main effort. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/6tvxOse1Kck?si=8laaIJtarn1tGqCR\">https://youtu.be/6tvxOse1Kck?si=8laaIJtarn1tGqCR</a></p>\n\n<p>Where is the current Russian strategic main effort? In the Donbas. Where are they massed? In the Donbas. Where are they taking ground? In the Donbas. Where is the premier UAF drone unit? Not in the Donbas. Where are the Ukrainians utterly wasting lives of a finite number of troops they might need in more important areas? Not the Donbas. </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, those UAF troops on the eastern side of the river aren&#39;t just human beings, they are the worst forms of anti-recruitment material imaginable because their plight is well known in a country that is rapidly losing faith in the war effort. Which has far more strategic consequences than Russian AFV losses around Krynky. The Ukrainians couldn&#39;t ever afford to be doing stupid shit like this, definitely not now. </p>\n\n<p>Read <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/ukraine/war-ukraine-not-stalemate\">this article by Jack Watling</a>. I don&#39;t fully agree with everything he writes but his recommendations are largely sound. Ukraine needs to be focusing on preserving its forces, rebuilding, training, getting better at warfare for a later date when legit offensives might be possible. And part of that requires major manpower solutions that cannot occur if the UAF actively use up their troops in an extremely callous and visible manner. I don&#39;t care if their kill ratio math is favorable and nobody else should either, spreadsheets don&#39;t win wars.</p>\n</div>",

The UAF dismounts on the eastern bank are doing very poorly, not their fault because it's deliberate and impossible to do well, they're there to draw the Russians to them.

Fire control literally means ways to control fire. It doesn't mean a weapon system effective range fan on a map actually means controlling those areas on the map, because that's never been the case and isn't the case now. Historically that's called harassment and interdiction and does not alone isolate an area.

        "body": "On the occasion of both the end of 2023 and having reached the figure of 40 thousand Russian military deaths in Ukraine confirmed by Mediazone, and my interest in the spatial distribution of the fallen, I created an Excel chart with Russian deaths by federal subject (oblast, krai...) per 100 thousand residents. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/hmnGaWl.png\n\nI used Mediazone\u2019s [datas]( https://en.zona.media/article/2022/05/20/casualties_eng) for the KIAs and Rosstat's [2021 census datas]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Russian_census) for population. Colors are for dividing regions by their federal district. Central FD = blue. North-Western FD = purple. Southern FD = red. North Caucasian FD = brown. Volga FD = green. Ural FD = gray. Siberian FD = light blue. Far Eastern FD = yellow. The average for Russia is in black and is 27,6. Out of 40599 KIAs, there are 264 foreign nationals, in addition to 274 Russians whose regional origin is unknown.\n\nSome notes and analysis of the findings.\n\nThe datas show just the KIAs confirmed by Mediazona. So obviously the figure excludes MIAs and KIAs whose death wasn\u2019t disclosed, and therefore the figure of 40k is clearly an underestimate. Datas for the most underdeveloped regions may even be more underestimated than the average, due to factors such as the lack of widespread social network access with which to make obituaries known. The underestimation is lower for regions such as Moscow Oblast and Krasnodar Krai because of the work of volunteers who document the dead soldiers in cemeteries in those regions. It means that the gap between places like Moscow and the Far Eastern regions is even larger than it seems.\n\nMediazona's datas account for PMCs and convicts deaths but exclude the D/LPR losses (i.e., the occupied areas, as of 23 February 2022, of the Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts). Until the DPR was included in the Russian Federation after the sham referendum, their government authorities published regular bulletins of the losses of the 1st Corps (DPR Army). In the last bulletin, dated 22 December 2022, the republic had recognized 4163 KIAs and 17329 WIAs. The rate would be 189 per 100k residents, which would put it off the scale. And these are only the confirmed losses in 2022. Per BBC News Russian D/LPR KIAs are at least 23 thousands at the end of November 2023, which would bump the rate to 620. This makes it clear why the units of the 1st and 2nd Corps today are overwhelmingly made up of mobilized and contract soldiers from Russia proper. Per BBC News Russian, Russia proper has at least 80 thousand KIAs.\n\nFor the Russian population datas I also included Crimea, as it\u2019s de facto a Russian region. The casualty figures for the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol are surprisingly low, an indication that they, being recognized as an integral part of the Federation, were spared by the total mobilization of D/LPR and were not disproportionately affected by the Russian partial mobilization. In the occupied areas of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson Oblasts, to my knowledge, Russia enlists collaborationists and in any case locals willing to volunteer, while I\u2019m not aware of a total mobilization as in D/LPR (which slowed down when these regions were formally annexed).\n\nMoscow and St. Petersburg (excluding their oblasts), which together make 12,6% of the Russian population, are virtually untouched by the war. This is because of several factors: very low share of soldiers from these cities in the Russian Army prior to the war in Ukraine, \"partial mobilization\" being much less prevalent relative to population than the country\u2019s average, much higher proportion of officers among those from these cities (thus lower probability of being killed), probably also much lower % of male population in jail and with criminal records than in certain Siberian or Far Eastern regions. Much of the soldiers from these cities are, for example, mobilized reserve officers or volunteers driven by ideological commitment. Let\u2019s also consider that the salaries and bonuses offered for contract soldiers are not attractive enough to residents of Moscow and St. Petersburg. \n\nIn contrast, residents of Buryatia (for example) are over-represented in everything: in contract soldiers, volunteers, mobilized and convicts. The figure should be understood as representative of residents, not ethnicities: as far as I am able to see, a significant proportion of the fallen from Buryatia are ethnic Russians, and there are ethnic minorities (Buryats, Yakuts, etc.) in the fallen from neighboring oblasts that are overwhelmingly ethnic Russian.\n\nIn the first place there is Tuva, Shoigu's birth region. It\u2019s a very poor region, so military careers are very relevant there. For example, at the beginning of the conflict there were Tuvans as contract soldiers in units from every Russian military district. They are largely concentrated, though, in the 55th Mountain Brigade of the 41st Army of the Central Military District, and the rate of losses has increased substantially since the beginning of the Avdiivka offensive in October. \n\nThe figures for the North Caucasian Federal District regions are surprisingly low, in spite of what I anecdotally read about the high presence of men from this area (primarily Dagestan) on the new contract soldiers. Note the very low figure for Chechnya, due to the fact that many Chechens deployed in Ukraine are Kadyrovites from the 141st Motorized Regiment of the Rosgvardia or from the Chechen OMON/SOBR units, who saw only a limited presence on the front lines (e.g. in Mariupol) but were later used only for rear and order-keeping roles. Unlike the \"Akhmat\" units, formed by Kadyrov during the war, which are actually involved in the frontline but are made up of contract soldiers from all over Russia and in fact to my knowledge, basically, just the officers are Chechens. The third lowest figure, however, is from Ingushetia. My personal theory, and I would like to hear what you guys think, is that Muslims are considerably less convinced about the war than the Orthodoxes (remember how involved the Russian Orthodox Church is in supporting the \"SMO\" and how widespread Orthodox religious iconography is among the patches or flags of Russian soldiers at the front), or even the agnostics or other religious minorities (e.g. Buddhists). Ingushetia is 96% Muslim. In contrast, the only North Caucasian region in the top ranks for deaths is North Ossetia, which is also the only North Caucasian region with a Christian majority, beside the above-average, Orthodox-plurality Stavropol Krai. Additional factors could be important, such as the high rurality of these regions and a smaller state capacity to enforce control over territory (e.g., enforcing mobilization notices) and less sense of loyalty to the authorities. Even places like Tatarstan or Bashkortostan, though large providers of volunteer units and contract soldiers (after all, they have large populations), are respectively surprisingly below average in losses and not much above, which could be due to the fact that they are Muslim-majority regions. The apparent not great support by Russian Muslims towards the war is admirable, considering that many of them come from poor or very poor regions.\n\nNote the high ranking of Pskov Oblast, where the 76th VDV Division is based, or even Kostroma Oblast, home of the 331st Air Assault Regiment of the 98th VDV Division, both units that had significant losses during the first month of the war and again in subsequent periods. This is not to say that the soldiers in a given unit are for the vast majority from the region where the unit is based, but there is nevertheless some correlation. Often the mobilized are sent to units based in their regions. Although progressively this correlation between where the unit's HQ is located and the origin of that unit's soldiers may get smaller, it is still evident: during the summer, the plurality of casualties originated from the regions of the Southern and North Caucasian Federal Districts, while since the beginning of the Avdiivka offensive the plurality of fatalities have come from the Ural Federal District, as well as from the Volga and Siberian Federal Districts, i.e., where the units of the Central MD are based (and let\u2019s add that many soldiers of the 1st Corps, formerly the DPR Army, are now from these federal districts). This correlation is not so great, for example, for residents of the Volga and Ural federal districts, which are areas with very high populations compared to the number of military units having their HQs there.\n\nThe distribution doesn\u2019t seem to be much affected by the urban/rural contrast: most of the oblasts with the largest share of rural inhabitants are below average, while (not considering Moscow and St. Petersburg) a good chunk of those with the highest share of urban inhabitants are above average. Urbanized and fairly developed and industrialized regions such as Sverdlovsk (Yekaterimburg region) or Chelyabinsk for example are above average and considering their population, are very important source basins for soldiers (and also convits). The high position of Kaliningrad could be due to the fact that even before the war an high proportion of residents were in the armed forces, as a result of the presence of the 11th Corps of the Baltic Fleet in the region (and other military installations). This also applies to Murmansk. I had read that in a village near the border with Norway (where the 14th Corps of the Arctic Fleet is located), in one elementary school 85% of the children's fathers were in Ukraine. The fact that, for example, Amur Oblast and Khabarovsk Krai are below average, unlike the vast majority of the other Far Eastern regions, could be due to the fact that since the Russian withdrawal from Kherson the 35th Army of the Eastern MD, based there, has never been involved in the hostilities in a major way.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>On the occasion of both the end of 2023 and having reached the figure of 40 thousand Russian military deaths in Ukraine confirmed by Mediazone, and my interest in the spatial distribution of the fallen, I created an Excel chart with Russian deaths by federal subject (oblast, krai...) per 100 thousand residents. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/hmnGaWl.png\">https://i.imgur.com/hmnGaWl.png</a></p>\n\n<p>I used Mediazone\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.zona.media/article/2022/05/20/casualties_eng\">datas</a> for the KIAs and Rosstat&#39;s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Russian_census\">2021 census datas</a> for population. Colors are for dividing regions by their federal district. Central FD = blue. North-Western FD = purple. Southern FD = red. North Caucasian FD = brown. Volga FD = green. Ural FD = gray. Siberian FD = light blue. Far Eastern FD = yellow. The average for Russia is in black and is 27,6. Out of 40599 KIAs, there are 264 foreign nationals, in addition to 274 Russians whose regional origin is unknown.</p>\n\n<p>Some notes and analysis of the findings.</p>\n\n<p>The datas show just the KIAs confirmed by Mediazona. So obviously the figure excludes MIAs and KIAs whose death wasn\u2019t disclosed, and therefore the figure of 40k is clearly an underestimate. Datas for the most underdeveloped regions may even be more underestimated than the average, due to factors such as the lack of widespread social network access with which to make obituaries known. The underestimation is lower for regions such as Moscow Oblast and Krasnodar Krai because of the work of volunteers who document the dead soldiers in cemeteries in those regions. It means that the gap between places like Moscow and the Far Eastern regions is even larger than it seems.</p>\n\n<p>Mediazona&#39;s datas account for PMCs and convicts deaths but exclude the D/LPR losses (i.e., the occupied areas, as of 23 February 2022, of the Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts).

                "body": "> Is it confirmed that Russian officers are taking fewer casualties per man than non officers? I believe that would be a reversal for most wars of US (and I think most countries?).\n\nSorry, I forgot to answer. The share of Russian officers killed in action is lower than the number of Russian officers in Ukraine if we look at how many officers a Russian motor rifle unit, i.e., the base of their army, should have in its ranks. It must also be said that as a result of the massive deployment of convicts, first by Wagner and now by the MoD, the share of officers in the total casualties has been reduced, as the penal units have a much lower number of officers than the equivalent regular unit. \n\nI don't have exact datas right now, but as far as I remember the probability of an officer getting killed has also been increasing due to events such as the growing mechanization of armies and especially the spread of air/rotorcrafts (e.g., I believe the figure for US officers killed in the Vietnam War is heavily affected by helicopter and aircraft losses).

The share of Russian officers killed in action is lower than the number of Russian officers in Ukraine if we look at how many officers a Russian motor rifle unit, i.e., the base of their army, should have in its ranks. It must also be said that as a result of the massive deployment of convicts, first by Wagner and now by the MoD, the share of officers in the total casualties has been reduced, as the penal units have a much lower number of officers than the equivalent regular unit. </p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t have exact datas right now, but as far as I remember the probability of an officer getting killed has also been increasing due to events such as the growing mechanization of armies and especially the spread of air/rotorcrafts (e.g., I believe the figure for US officers killed in the Vietnam War is heavily affected by helicopter and aircraft losses).

The whole video is worth a listen and it's timestamped well (as is Perun tradition) but here's some bits I found worth highlighting:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **The mood of media, especially western media**\n\nIn the section 'Emptied the Armories', Perun gives an example from the BBC where the beeb claimed that NATO has \"emptied its armouries and committed everything short of going to war\". He then goes on to say that this is equivocally false (as we all know well) but raises the more interesting point later on the video that there has been multiple shifts in narrative amongst the west: from \"Ukraine will fall in a week\" before the war, to when Russia is getting routinely embarassed and especially after the Kharkiv counteroffensive where Ukraine might actually reconquer all its territory, to now after the failure of the summer offensive and the malaise in the US congress which is back to \"Ukraine is going to lose\" again.\n\nIn reality, this is all part of a larger attritional warfare Perun saw coming ever since the Russians pulled out of Kiev.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Foreign Support**\n\nIn the section 'The World and Ukraine', Perun talks about how Germany has really stepped up in supporting Ukraine after the US slowdown. The only issue is that Germany is very selective on what aid they want to give, especially on long range fires. But it's something France and the UK can and should help out in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Landmines are back**\n\nIn 'Weapons and Tools', Perun talks about how new technology such as artillery and drone deployed mines means mines are now an incredibly potent tactical tool again as you're not risking assets to deploy them, and different militaries have taken notice. Which means that global conferences on mine controls is probably dead in the water.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **The $75Bn question**\n\nI asked [this question](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/18tmmby/comment/kfj3h53/?context=3) a week ago actually, but Perun caveats with if it's *specifically for military assistance*. Perun seems to think that this number could be decisive for Ukraine's efforts, as it allows Ukraine to really scale up on the things they're good at but need resources for (drones) as well as acquire the things they're not good at in significant quantities (artillery shells, long range fires like cruise missiles, GMLRS). He actually lists 'armoring up the force' as the second bottom priority.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Western industry hasn't stagnated, it's just military procurement is too small of a quantity in a capitalist economy.**\n\nMuch paper has been spent writing about the state of western industries and how they are hopelessly outmatched in production when compared to China or Russia. They also don't seem to be using automation and robotics as much.\n\nPerun's point is that it simply isn't worth it to retool the factories to something higher scale or higher tech because procurement quantities are relatively low. Western industry is still as capable as it was in the 1900's - just look at civilian manufacturing - it's just that the 'peace dividend' has cut procurement numbers so much that the defense industry never needed to scale up their production anymore. So you have pictures of old rust belt workers filling a 155mm shell by hand (Perun points out that this is the same in Russia, but cut the shell by 3mm and replace the rust belt worker with a babushka) instead of a robot arm doing it.\n\nThis can easily be solved if procurement is done instead at scale and with partner countries. For example, instead of buying 100 tanks, make an order for 400 and ask your allies if they want in.\n\nEDIT: To the friendly reporter: I appreciate your (for once) kind words but please just write a comment, I am begging you.",

            "body": "Made [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/190rnct/credibledefense_daily_megathread_january_07_2024/kgt32tw/) comment yesterday, and someone was kind enough to PM to tell me I was wrong and was [underestimating](https://twitter.com/cameron19460429/status/1733670684700594436?s=61&t=rmEeUn68HhlFHGKbTPQr_A) BAE's new production ramp up. Without being able to see the thread in its entirety, in the context of this conversation, it's not really important whether a specific company makes a few hundred thousand shells more. What's far more important is the ability to scale up production due to new industrial processes and systems. \n\nBut one of the things that gets ignored far too often on this topic of industrial production is overt consolidation in defense primes. But let's take it one step further and see how this impacts what's happening on the ground. [In 2020](https://news.lockheedmartin.com/2020-12-20-Lockheed-Martin-to-Acquire-Aerojet-Rocketdyne-Strengthening-Position-as-Leading-Provider-of-Technologies-to-Deter-Threats-and-Help-Secure-the-United-States-and-its-Allies), LMT wanted to acquire AJRD. For years, LMT's management had been complaining that AJRD was the bottleneck in increasing production of solid rocket motors that go into a variety of its products, including the now famous GMLRS. By mid-decade, there were only two U.S. producers of these rockets left in the U.S. due to consolidation and redundancies. The second one was Orbital ATK that was acquired by [NOC in 2018](https://investor.northropgrumman.com/investor-resources/orbital-atk-acquisition). Since LMT's acquisition of AJRD was considered a vertical acquisition, and because of the wide-ranging repercussions of these deals, the [FTC said](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-25/aerojet-shares-plunge-as-lockheed-expects-ftc-to-block-deal) it would sue to block the acquisition in *January 2022*. \n\nAJRD, in the meantime, was in dire need of a capital injection to scale up throughput and modernize its operations. The DoD finally made this investment in AJRD via a Manufacturing Capability Expansion and Investment Prioritization (MCEIP) in [*April 2023*](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3362263/dod-strengthens-supply-chain-for-solid-rocket-motors/). In the meantime, [LHX was trying to acquire AJRD](https://www.l3harris.com/newsroom/press-release/2022/12/l3harris-acquire-aerojet-rocketdyne), while [LMT was putting up hurdles](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/lockheed-says-it-has-raised-concerns-over-l3harris-aerojet-deal-2023-06-20/) to prevent the deal from closing, which further delayed closing. In the meantime, NOC was slowly starting to lay the foundation to [raise production](https://news.northropgrumman.com/news/releases/northrop-grumman-invests-in-new-solid-rocket-motor-manufacturing-facilities-in-magna-utah) for its rocket motors just *about a year ago*. \n\nNow, why am I italicizing these dates and why are they so important? Because the invasion of Ukraine started in Feb 2022, HIMARS/GMLRS were approved by the summer, and you had news report after news report, thinktank after thinktank, analyst after analyst, all saying that ammunition production needed to be scaled up. That's putting aside the facts that solid rocket motors go in more than just GMLRS (including stingers and javelins) and that this issue had been highlighted by various managements (beyond just LMT's) for close to a decade. Yet, throughout this process, the FTC was still blocking the deal, these companies were still trying to protect their turf, the DoD was absent, and shareholders were waiting with patience with nary any activism. This would certainly not have been the case if the U.S. was fighting a war itself.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Made <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/190rnct/credibledefense_daily_megathread_january_07_2024/kgt32tw/\">this</a> comment yesterday, and someone was kind enough to PM to tell me I was wrong and was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cameron19460429/status/1733670684700594436?s=61&amp;t=rmEeUn68HhlFHGKbTPQr_A\">underestimating</a> BAE&#39;s new production ramp up. Without being able to see the thread in its entirety, in the context of this conversation, it&#39;s not really important whether a specific company makes a few hundred thousand shells more. What&#39;s far more important is the ability to scale up production due to new industrial processes and systems. </p>\n\n<p>But one of the things that gets ignored far too often on this topic of industrial production is overt consolidation in defense primes. But let&#39;s take it one step further and see how this impacts what&#39;s happening on the ground. <a href=\"https://news.lockheedmartin.com/2020-12-20-Lockheed-Martin-to-Acquire-Aerojet-Rocketdyne-Strengthening-Position-as-Leading-Provider-of-Technologies-to-Deter-Threats-and-Help-Secure-the-United-States-and-its-Allies\">In 2020</a>, LMT wanted to acquire AJRD. For years, LMT&#39;s management had been complaining that AJRD was the bottleneck in increasing production of solid rocket motors that go into a variety of its products, including the now famous GMLRS. By mid-decade, there were only two U.S. producers of these rockets left in the U.S. due to consolidation and redundancies. The second one was Orbital ATK that was acquired by <a href=\"https://investor.northropgrumman.com/investor-resources/orbital-atk-acquisition\">NOC in 2018</a>. Since LMT&#39;s acquisition of AJRD was considered a vertical acquisition, and because of the wide-ranging repercussions of these deals, the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-25/aerojet-shares-plunge-as-lockheed-expects-ftc-to-block-deal\">FTC said</a> it would sue to block the acquisition in <em>January 2022</em>. </p>\n\n<p>AJRD, in the meantime, was in dire need of a capital injection to scale up throughput and modernize its operations. The DoD finally made this investment in AJRD via a Manufacturing Capability Expansion and Investment Prioritization (MCEIP) in <a href=\"https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3362263/dod-strengthens-supply-chain-for-solid-rocket-motors/\"><em>April 2023</em></a>. In the meantime, <a href=\"https://www.l3harris.com/newsroom/press-release/2022/12/l3harris-acquire-aerojet-rocketdyne\">LHX was trying to acquire AJRD</a>, while <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/lockheed-says-it-has-raised-concerns-over-l3harris-aerojet-deal-2023-06-20/\">LMT was putting up hurdles</a> to prevent the deal from closing, which further delayed closing. In the meantime, NOC was slowly starting to lay the foundation to <a href=\"https://news.northropgrumman.com/news/releases/northrop-grumman-invests-in-new-solid-rocket-motor-manufacturing-facilities-in-magna-utah\">raise production</a> for its rocket motors just <em>about a year ago</em>. </p>\n\n<p>Now, why am I italicizing these dates and why are they so important? Because the invasion of Ukraine started in Feb 2022, HIMARS/GMLRS were approved by the summer, and you had news report after news report, thinktank after thinktank, analyst after analyst, all saying that ammunition production needed to be scaled up. That&#39;s putting aside the facts that solid rocket motors go in more than just GMLRS (including stingers and javelins) and that this issue had been highlighted by various managements (beyond just LMT&#39;s) for close to a decade. Yet, throughout this process, the FTC was still blocking the deal, these companies were still trying to protect their turf, the DoD was absent, and shareholders were waiting with patience with nary any activism. This would certainly not have been the case if the U.S. was fighting a war itself. The FTC would not have blocked the initial deal for LMT to purchase AJRD to start with. </p>\n\n<p>Again, the entire reason that this issue exists <em>is</em> because the industry had consolidated to the extent it did, and that power is now so concentrated in a few manufacturers. If the usually pro-free market, invisible hand WSJ is calling for more monopoly busting in the defense contractor sector, then you know the situation has got really out of hand. Further, vertical integrations are always going to receive more pushback from regulators like the FTC. <em>However</em>, in the short-term, in the case of a peer-level hot war that the U.S. was involved in, this deal would not have been blocked and throughput would have scaled up immensely. </p>\n\n<p>Where are we on this issue today? LMT&#39;s CEO said in their last earnings that they want to bring solid rocket motor production inhouse. LHX&#39;s CEO said they are working on acquisition integration and that, and I quote, <em>&quot;our number one priority is to increase the deliveries, specifically in the rocket motor sector&quot;</em>.

I'm no expert, but a European NATO spending 2% gdp on defense should be enough to deter Russia, particularly since they should be able to roll back Russian air defenses with the big fleet of f-35 if the pilots are training for that mission set, and then gain air superiority (correct me if I'm wrong). The most scary scenario for Europe is probably Russia testing article 5 during a Taiwan contingency with a grey-zone attack, making it difficult how to respond, and it's not that I'm not worried at all, but I think it's going to be ok, as such an attack would probably be in the Baltics, and the Baltic states would be very public in calling for NATO support, leaving European leaders with no choice. Then there is the nuclear component of course, but that deterrent works both ways. The bigger question is Taiwan, where it seems increasingly likely that USA and China are heading to war, and where US American planning has apparently been for a short war, somewhat discounting the risk of a long war where industrial capacity would matter a lot. The war is also so far from US American shores, and although USA has done a good job of rallying allies in East Asia these past years, they could really have done more if they had been stronger internally (for example kept TPP, showing Japan, SK and the rest that both their economic and political security lies with USA, instead of giving them the Sophie's choice they have now).

During the work, the towing cables of the BREM-1 broke , which was reported to the command.\n\nColonel Ospanov took the initiative and decided to personally deliver spare cables for the evacuation of the armored personnel carrier. Having loaded into the UAZ, the group led by Ospanov went to the evacuation site.\n\nFurther, after the colonel arrived at the armored personnel carrier and began installing tow ropes, the evacuation group came under artillery fire from the Ukrainian Armed Forces.\n\nAs a result of the strikes, the head of the armored service of the Airborne Forces, Colonel Ospanov Arman Tolegenovich, and the commander of the evacuation department of one of the units of the 104th Airborne Division, Sergeant Krasnov Alexander Anatolyevich, died on the spot .

A close comrade of the Airborne Forces commander, Colonel General Mikhail Teplinsky.</p>\n\n<p>On January 6, Colonel Ospanov arrived with a check at the location of the recreated 104th Airborne Assault Division ( the division was restored on 01.12.23 on the basis of the 31st Airborne Brigade ) near the settlement Kozachi Lahery, Kherson region.</p>\n\n<p>Upon arrival, Ospanov found the following situation - a group of servicemen of the 104th Airborne Division on the BREM-1 left to carry out evacuation work on the BTR-82A which was stuck in the area of \u200b\u200bthe settlement Kozachi Lahery. During the work, the towing cables of the BREM-1 broke , which was reported to the command.</p>\n\n<p>Colonel Ospanov took the initiative and decided to personally deliver spare cables for the evacuation of the armored personnel carrier. Having loaded into the UAZ, the group led by Ospanov went to the evacuation site.</p>\n\n<p>Further, after the colonel arrived at the armored personnel carrier and began installing tow ropes, the evacuation group came under artillery fire from the Ukrainian Armed Forces.</p>\n\n<p>As a result of the strikes, the head of the armored service of the Airborne Forces, Colonel Ospanov Arman Tolegenovich, and the commander of the evacuation department of one of the units of the 104th Airborne Division, Sergeant Krasnov Alexander Anatolyevich, died on the spot . Also, privates of the 104th Airborne Division Evstigneev and Eisner were injured .</p>\n</div>",

The two threads now suggest _pre-war_ output of between 100k and 192k **155mm** annually, and that seems _suuuuuuper_ high considering the minimal artillery use in the British Army. The 100k per-year claim comes from [news reports](https://www.joint-forces.com/videos/38223-bae-systems-2-4-billion-uk-ngms-order) about [this announcement](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/24-billion-munitions-deal-secures-thousands-of-uk-jobs) - but the announcement itself gives no details about the breakdown of production and I'm unclear where the 100k figure is drawn from. It's suggested to me that it's plausible given the \u00a32.4 billion figure over 15 years is ~\u00a3160,000,000 yearly and that the [US at least can buy shells for ~$800](https://archive.is/gYcow), so there's plenty of money there really. On the other hand the breakdown is usually given as follows:\n\n> BAE will produce approximately:\n>   \n>    100,000 large calibre rounds per annum   \n>    40,000 medium calibre rounds per annum   \n>    75,000 mortars per annum    \n>    70,000,000 small arms ammunition rounds per annum    \n\nAnd my suspicion there would be that \"large calibre rounds\" encompasses 155mm and 105mm (and possibly even 120mm for Challenger) with \"medium calibre rounds\" being the 30mm for Warrior and the Royal Navy...suggesting that, wherever that 100k claim comes from, it's not exclusively 155mm. The higher 192k figure from your source there is a bit unclear, they say:\n\n> What I can share is a BAE PDF talking about how they achieved a record 600 shells a day in 2013. And how we got to 16,000 a month considering likely maintenance schedules around that. Also based on how long the process takes for the schuler presses to shape the projectiles\n\nBuuut assuming they're running 1-8-5 shift pattern, even if every working day (average 22 per month) matched the record breaking 600 shells per day it'd be just 13,200 - 158,400 a year without accounting for their \"likely maintenance schedules\" at all. So...I'm not sure that the highest figures from either source necessarily holds up to scrutiny, but even compensating them downwards this suggests that the UK produces far more artillery ammunition than I expected.

They're not in a position to protest. These aren't self-made businesspeople who have built innovative companies from scratch. Their wealth is primarily a result of Putin bestowing on them state-owned companies to run or own. They then proceed to siphon off their \"fair share\" (billions) from these companies.",

I say on the margin b/c nobody would be borrowing at 16% in order to invest in their business expansion or even for any consumption if they had any intention to pay that money back.  You would have to grow your revenue by at least double digits just to cover the interests and if you have a business that can grow your revenue by that much you would be stupid to set up shop in Russia.",

For example, Saudi Arabia is selling oil for record-low prices:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/oil-slides-saudi-price-cuts-counter-middle-east-worries-2024-01-08/\">Oil falls about 4% as Saudi price cuts add to demand doubts</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>On Sunday, rising supply and competition from rival producers prompted Saudi Arabia to cut the February official selling price (OSP) of its flagship Arab Light crude to Asia to the lowest level in 27 months.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>&quot;If we were just to focus on the fundamentals, including higher inventories, higher OPEC/non-OPEC production and a lower than expected Saudi OSP, it would be impossible to be anything other than bearish on crude oil,&quot; said IG analyst Tony Sycamore.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;However, that doesn&#39;t take into account the fact that geopolitical tensions in the Middle East are undeniably rising again, which will mean limited downside.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Why aren&#39;t those countries doing more to end the blockade?</p>\n</div>",

He does not want his health being part of the news. Unfortunately for him, he became very ill on 1 January requiring ICU. He did not tell many people he was sick. His own chief of staff was also sick.  Without waiving his privacy broadly, communication about his health became difficult. Open question on who's job it became to relay Austin's poor health up and down the chain. \n\nWho know what when are the biggest questions with the story.\n\nEdit: some more answers. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>At the Pentagon, meanwhile, \\[spokesman Maj. Gen. Patrick \\] Ryder acknowledged during an hour-long back-and-forth with reporters that he first learned of Austin\u2019s hospitalization Jan. 2, two days before that information was transmitted to the National Security Council and three days before it was disclosed to Congress and the public. A handful of other Defense Department officials, including Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Kelly Magsamen, Austin\u2019s chief of staff; and Lt. Gen. Ronald Clark, Austin\u2019s senior military assistant; also were apprised of the secretary\u2019s medical situation before the White House was made aware.  \nStill, no one at the Pentagon notified Congress or Austin\u2019s No. 2, Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks, even after Hicks assumed some of Austin\u2019s duties during a previously planned vacation to Puerto Rico, Pentagon officials said. Ryder blamed the breakdown on Magsamen having contracted the flu, requiring her to miss work. It remains unclear whether Magsamen delegated any responsibilities to subordinates while she was ill. Ryder said it was the chief of staff who ultimately notified Biden\u2019s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, at the White House on Jan. 4.\n\n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/01/08/lloyd-austin-hospitalized/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/01/08/lloyd-austin-hospitalized/)",

He does not want his health being part of the news. Unfortunately for him, he became very ill on 1 January requiring ICU. He did not tell many people he was sick. His own chief of staff was also sick.  Without waiving his privacy broadly, communication about his health became difficult. Open question on who&#39;s job it became to relay Austin&#39;s poor health up and down the chain. </p>\n\n<p>Who know what when are the biggest questions with the story.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: some more answers. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>At the Pentagon, meanwhile, [spokesman Maj. Gen. Patrick ] Ryder acknowledged during an hour-long back-and-forth with reporters that he first learned of Austin\u2019s hospitalization Jan. 2, two days before that information was transmitted to the National Security Council and three days before it was disclosed to Congress and the public. A handful of other Defense Department officials, including Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Kelly Magsamen, Austin\u2019s chief of staff; and Lt. Gen. Ronald Clark, Austin\u2019s senior military assistant; also were apprised of the secretary\u2019s medical situation before the White House was made aware.<br/>\nStill, no one at the Pentagon notified Congress or Austin\u2019s No. 2, Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks, even after Hicks assumed some of Austin\u2019s duties during a previously planned vacation to Puerto Rico, Pentagon officials said. Ryder blamed the breakdown on Magsamen having contracted the flu, requiring her to miss work. It remains unclear whether Magsamen delegated any responsibilities to subordinates while she was ill. Ryder said it was the chief of staff who ultimately notified Biden\u2019s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, at the White House on Jan. 4.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/01/08/lloyd-austin-hospitalized/\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/01/08/lloyd-austin-hospitalized/</a></p>\n</div>",

For a million shells a year, we're talking five billion dollars. This is a drop in the bucket of aid sent so far. It is roughly 1% of Germany's federal budget.

A stockpile of surplus rounds began to form as the US stopped expending rounds in combat. Shells could be sent to Ukraine without too much fear, after all we had a stockpile. \n\nThat being said, the COIN operations of years past had not necessitated the huge quantities of artillery shells that Ukraine is currently expending, and certainly would not match what would be needed for replenishment in a near-peer conflict. Logistics experts warned of the sluggish rate of artillery production in that case for some time now.\n\nThe US has a few plants producing these shells; one in Iowa, and two in Pennsylvania. They produced, cumulatively per month about 14,000 shells before 2022 and doubled to 28,000 in 2022. That\u2019s about the upper limit of what these 3 factories can do without more investment. Keep in mind, roughly half of that still has to be stockpiled to keep up the previous stockpile rate, and I\u2019ll bet at least a portion of the additional production is going toward replacing what was already taken out of the stockpile for Ukraine. \n\nSo what\u2019s stopping them from getting the shells they need? On one hand, it\u2019s money. Ukraine doesn\u2019t have much actual liquid money of their own for defense spending; what they *do* and *did* have they mostly spent on indigenous weapons production. This is your BTR-4s, your Fort and Malyuk rifles. They didn\u2019t have anything firing 155mm so no tooling was produced or moved to set up indigenous production. \n\nThis hasn\u2019t been an issue for the other received equipment, however. Ukraine receives more or less a budget on aid and can spend what it needs within that budget. But the real issue is, they can\u2019t buy more shells than are available to them. And those factories have reached more or less their upper limit. Ukraine cannot really feasibly spend its own money on investments in those factories, and indigenous production is a long way off. \n\nSo Ukraine is kind of stuck; with NATO across the board ramping up 155mm production it may benefit them, but this ramp isn\u2019t *for* Ukraine. These nations are recognizing that a near-peer land war necessitates significant artillery stockpiles (which has been a warning by analysts for at least a decade). Maybe with more money to spend they\u2019ll be able to trim a little more off the top, but in my personal opinion that is unlikely to match the rate of attrition we\u2019ve seen with current operational doctrine.\n\n->I\u2019d be happy to link articles if you ask, I find it a bit clunky to place in a reply including other text.",

In this case, these are individual successive bounds, rushing done between every two men, a buddy team. Drop prone, shoot, get up and run for 3-5 seconds and hit the ground again. \n\n\"I'm up, they see me, I'm down\" is the US diddy taught to Soldiers and Marines, the length of time to say that out loud without a pause is how long you should move for. The idea behind that is if an enemy were to spot you while you're moving it'll take over 3-5 seconds to see you, mentally make the decision to shoot you, and then accurately aim in and fire, and hopefully by that point you already dropped behind cover, dropped prone to maybe disappear in the vegetation line or even take a knee to limit your profile. \n\nThey're doing it in an open field in the first video because it's the crawl phase of training and it's easier for leaders to control and easier for the men to stay on line with each other (which is imperative to prevent fratricide). We call them \"grass drills\" in the USMC and Army, you find a big ass open grass field, a grass parade ground is perfect, and you rehearse on that until everyone knows exactly what they're supposed to be doing, and then you move into more difficult terrain, night, CBNR, introduce casualties, introduce combined arms and heavy weapons, etc.\n\nIn the second video, that too looks like training on a legit trench system, more of a walk or run phase. Though it might be a real one with little to no resistance for whatever reason (I think it's just training). There are some tactical problems I can point out, it's done in broad daylight, no smoke for obscuration, no suppression minus small arms fire from within the squad against the objective especially no heavy fires, etc. But overall, I've seen worse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>It doesn't look like traditional bound overwatch either, since the fire and maneuver elements are intermingled, instead of being split into separate teams.\n\nWhen doing bounding maneuvers between full teams, squads or even platoons, one entire element minimum (sometimes more) is stationary doing overwatch, at least watching if not firing at known, likely or suspected enemy positions on the enemy objective being assaulted, while the other element moves. \n\nBut often times the maneuvering element doesn't move as one, especially if they're taking fire or there is a serious threat, so they also perform their own bounding overwatch within their subunit. Especially at the last hundred meters or so when supporting fires lift and the assault element takes over the suppression role with the assault role. So they break the movement down to maximize firepower, sectors of fire, and movement too. The assault itself is usually done by individual bounds.\n\nThe purpose of marching fire, aka assault fire, is to avoid doing that. The idea behind it is that all the communication and initiative necessary make it work is too difficult under realistic combat conditions in modern high intensity warfare dominated especially by indirect fire being the largest casualty producer. Problem one is that it expects conventional troops to deliberately drop into cover to shoot, and then consistently get up and move again, leaving the safety of cover and concealment, which isn't realistic. It requires too much sideways communication under the deafening and confusing confines of the close fight in warfare, while corporals, sergeants or lieutenants are literally kicking asses and endangering themselves trying to get the men moving again. \n\nAnd it's very very slow. With an attack, speed often helps, the assault element might be able to reach the objective before enemy indirect fires can land on them, as it often takes multiple minutes to call in a fire mission, a fast assault that rushes an objective before the enemy even know they're on them can take them quickly, whereas it takes while to advance forward when moving in 3-5 second rushes (roughly 3 meters each rush). Walking might take two minutes, doing rushes might take 20 minutes and that assumes it's continuous and doesn't bog down. \n\nIf another support element or overwatch is already supposed to be suppressing the objective right up until the assault element reaches it, which they are doctrinally supposed to be doing, then the assault element only needs small arms fire to take over the suppression role at the last hundred meters or less, and they can do that quick and relatively accurate (volume making up for accuracy) by advancing together on foot without pausing. If they are being shot at while the assault element is advancing on foot, then the supporting fire plan failed, and the assault was likely going to fail anyway. \n\nThe theory goes that if the assault element doesn't have an outside force suppressing the objective, whether they use bounding overwatch or not isn't going to matter if they take effective fire. They'll initially avoid small arms fire losses compared to a unit where everyone is on their feet, but they're going to get bogged down quicker, and once they're suppressed and in place that is when they are most vulnerable to the real killers, mortars and artillery that will take time to be called on them, but will more easily hit them if they can't get out of the impact area quickly.",

So presuming some unscrupulous officers were say, overstating missile procurement costs to line their own pockets, that would qualify as &quot;water-filling&quot; their missiles.</p>\n\n<p>In English terms, it would be like hearing &quot;padding the budget&quot; and concluding that the budget was spent on feminine hygiene products.</p>\n</div>",

            "body": "The Ukrainian ground offensive culminated in October and has since been graded as a failure by the UA govt as well as the international community.\n\nThough it isn't connected, the recent UAF strikes against the Russian Navy in the Black Sea have hurt Russia strategically and reopened sea lanes, essentially breaking open the blockade as Russia reacted to the added strikes on Sevastopol and other Crimean ports forced them to shift forces out of Crimea to Novorossiysk. Whether the Ukrainians can keep the corridor open remains to be seen, as of yet they don't have the ability to credibly strike Russian naval assets at Novorossiysk to the same degree as Crimean targets, so the Russians might be able to adjust and at least temporarily reestablish the blockade. But it's still good news for Ukraine.\n\nThe Russians turned out to be far more resilient than much of the press was making them out to be before and during the UAF offensive. Turns out they had plenty of reserves left, didn't suffer extensive damage, and immediately went on the counteroffensive. Things are very hot all over Ukraine, with counterattacks against the limited Ukrainian gains as well as attacks in other areas. No breakthroughs or current tactical emergencies for the Ukrainians, but it's not good.\n\nRussia managed to essentially bribe their way to a rather successful recruitment campaign, bringing in between 20-40k new troops every month, which is pretty good. They don't even need to rely on involuntary conscription minus the 2022 partial mobilization, which limits the political pressure on Putin. They had taken rather draconian military industry measures, something like a 68% rise in military spending, which translates to a wartime economy for them, and lots of that production increase is starting to come on line now. It won't keep up with losses but it's still decent. \n\nAdditionally, while they've been getting Iranian drone purchases for over a year now they recently got North Korea to help, they purchased something like 1-2 million artillery shells and got mid range ballistic missiles too.\n\nThe Russian strategic air strike campaign against Ukrainian infrastructure using long range PGM started briefly during a cold spell in November, but then has been going nightly for about a week now. While the UAF are downing most of the drones and some of the cruise and ballistic missiles, many are getting through. While many civilian targets were deliberately or negligently hit by direct hits or debris from air-to-air intercepts, non-propaganda reporting is suggesting that they're again going after energy, civilian industry, military industry, and other types of legitimate targets. Ukraine's integrated air defense network seems to be concentrated over Kyiv, the Russians are having much better success hitting targets elsewhere.\n\nAdditionally, the Ukrainian manpower crisis that was starting to rear its head last January-February is reaching critical levels. All summer, fall and winter, the UAF supposedly didn't meet manpower goals. Widespread corruption and incompetence reported over the mid summer led Zelensky to fire every regional military recruitment commander at the same time. But it's only gotten worse. A significant portion of the military aged male population are reluctant to fight, while the existing conscription pool was deliberately limited. There has been legislation pending to increase the conscription pool but it's stalled in the Rada and being debated. The UAF has unofficially said they need 400-500k new troops in 2025, needing to replace losses, build more units, and hopefully start relieving the troops who have been fighting for 36 months or longer. \n\nMeanwhile, UAF military recruiters are routinely being caught on video pretty much everywhere now grabbing people off the streets, from gyms, restaurants, clubs, and vehicle checkpoints set up on highways in order to find and immediately conscript anyone who doesn't have proof they've been exempted, with many of those being inducted into the military. The optics are very bad at the moment, which is likely why the new legislation hasn't been signed, it'll cause even more of that as the ultra aggressive military recruiters will have a much larger quota to make while also being allowed to pull them from an enlarged demographic. \n\nWestern support to Ukraine is lagging, not surprising because many considered that the outcome of the UAF 2023 offensive would dictate future support. It's been especially bad in the US as partisan politics over Ukraine and border security have led to a 2024 package for Ukraine not having been passed, so what Ukraine has gotten in the last three months from the US, it's primary patron, hasnt been enough. There is a possibility a deal might be made, and if so some aid will be be forthcoming, military and financial, which might include up to $300 billion in Russian reserves that Western nations are thinking they might confiscate from banks and give to Ukraine.\n\nUnfortunately, even if military aid does start flowing again, 2024 is going to be a tough year for Ukrainian artillery, as the US has largely exhausted its own stockpiles that it can give without significantly sacrificing national security, and the number is global stockpiles of allied nations who are willing to contribute are also low after two years of being picked over. Current monthly artillery production capacity won't remotely match Ukrainian needs, and the earlier investments to increase production aren't expected to reach full capacity until well into 2025.\n\nRussian munitions production, artillery and FPV drones, plus those gotten from allies, have given them a decisive edge in fires again. Nowhere near 2022 levels, but better than Ukraine who is at the lowest level of the war. \n\nStrategically, the UAF committed openly to establishing their own fixed defenses similar to the deep and well established Russian defenses built in late 2022 and into 2023. And there is lots of talk among credible sources recommending Ukraine adopt a defensive strategy for 2024, conserve manpower and rebuild offensive potential as it waits for western artillery production capacity to enlarge, but there is no word from the UA govt or UAF top brass if they have accepted that. \n\nZelensky's popularity is at the worst for the war. While he's still polling with positive approval ratings, they've dropped to the 60% level, and it's affecting him. There is more political infighting now being reported, especially between Zelensky and General Zaluzhny, who many hope will run for president in potential mid 2024 elections. Meanwhile, Western press started to more commonly report on negative issues regarding Ukraine, signalling an acceptance in the West to more openly criticize how things are doing and to discuss the negatives. \n\nThere is some talk about negotiations, but nothing has happened militarily yet that would even really allow for that to happen in my opinion, someone needs to lose more before that could be viable.",

        "body": "I posted this on r/UkraineRussiaReport originally and wanted to get you guys's opinion on it.\n\nYou know, I've been thinking. This new Cold War doesn't seem to have an underlying social or economic theme like the 20th century Cold War did. The US and its allies back essentially any countries that will ally with them, regardless of if they're democratic or not. Countries like Saudi Arabia, the UAE, the Philippines, Ukraine, Somalia, and and endless number of other states all receive heavy support from the West equaling or surpassing that of democratic countries in Europe. Likewise, democratic countries like Mongolia, Serbia, and Namibia frequently side with Russia and China on geopolitical matters.\n\nTo me, the sides of Cold War II seem like they're split on (of all things) international relations theory more than anything else. Think about it; NATO and its supporters constantly talk about how they're upholding international peace, democracy, the rules-based world order, what have you. Moreover, they hold a normative view that the Western liberal approach is an objectively-correct way for countries to be run and that they're in strategic competition with inherently aggressive, totalitarian, undemocratic regimes. However, they also acknowledge the necessity of backing undemocratic states such as the GCC countries for geopolitical purposes and using force (preemptively if necessary) against countries which oppose Western liberalism (e.g. Iraq, Iran, Syria, Afghanistan, Russia, Libya, Cuba, North Korea, etc.).\n\nThis approach to geopolitics is fairly similar to the one that the West held in the first Cold War. However, I think the key difference here is that the Warsaw Pact and its allies held their own normative views of how nations should be run. That, of course, being through communism and socialism. They subsequently sought to build up their own rules-based world order around this and competed with the West through that ideological paradigm. For this reason, realist views of international affairs were much more common in the West at the time, as it was clear that any liberal view of geopolitics was ultimately subjective to ideological influence, rather than a purely descriptive explanation of what motivates nations to act.\n\nOn the other hand, the modern Russia-China axis seems based on a realist view of international affairs. Both Russia and China (as well as their individual and institutional supporters worldwide) frequently talk about the need for a \"multi-polar world\", with Russia in particular stating its desire to retain influence over former Soviet countries. There's little to no normative ideological basis for how Russia and China seek to promote their geopolitical decisions to the world. Rather, they largely frame the actions they take (such as attacking Ukraine or hosting drills around Taiwan) as reactions against Western countries seeking to impose their influence on them. In that sense, they base their geopolitical decisions on the descriptive idea that every country will seek to gain influence over its neighbors, and that they need to do the same insofar as it is beneficial to their people and governments. Whether that be through economic means (Belt and Road initiative) or through military means (attacking Ukraine).\n\nIn my opinion, this is a perfect explanation as to what truly divides the two sides in Cold War II. It would also explain why realist views of international affairs are frequently seen as pro-Russian by Western liberals (John Mearsheimer, for example). It would also explain why modern Western militaries focus much more on power projection than their Russian/Chinese counterparts, as they feel the need to actively support liberalism worldwide through offensive and defensive military actions. What do you guys think?",

However, they also acknowledge the necessity of backing undemocratic states such as the GCC countries for geopolitical purposes and using force (preemptively if necessary) against countries which oppose Western liberalism (e.g. Iraq, Iran, Syria, Afghanistan, Russia, Libya, Cuba, North Korea, etc.).</p>\n\n<p>This approach to geopolitics is fairly similar to the one that the West held in the first Cold War. However, I think the key difference here is that the Warsaw Pact and its allies held their own normative views of how nations should be run. That, of course, being through communism and socialism. They subsequently sought to build up their own rules-based world order around this and competed with the West through that ideological paradigm. For this reason, realist views of international affairs were much more common in the West at the time, as it was clear that any liberal view of geopolitics was ultimately subjective to ideological influence, rather than a purely descriptive explanation of what motivates nations to act.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the modern Russia-China axis seems based on a realist view of international affairs. Both Russia and China (as well as their individual and institutional supporters worldwide) frequently talk about the need for a &quot;multi-polar world&quot;, with Russia in particular stating its desire to retain influence over former Soviet countries. There&#39;s little to no normative ideological basis for how Russia and China seek to promote their geopolitical decisions to the world. Rather, they largely frame the actions they take (such as attacking Ukraine or hosting drills around Taiwan) as reactions against Western countries seeking to impose their influence on them. In that sense, they base their geopolitical decisions on the descriptive idea that every country will seek to gain influence over its neighbors, and that they need to do the same insofar as it is beneficial to their people and governments. Whether that be through economic means (Belt and Road initiative) or through military means (attacking Ukraine).</p>\n\n<p>In my opinion, this is a perfect explanation as to what truly divides the two sides in Cold War II. It would also explain why realist views of international affairs are frequently seen as pro-Russian by Western liberals (John Mearsheimer, for example). It would also explain why modern Western militaries focus much more on power projection than their Russian/Chinese counterparts, as they feel the need to actively support liberalism worldwide through offensive and defensive military actions. What do you guys think?</p>\n</div>",
