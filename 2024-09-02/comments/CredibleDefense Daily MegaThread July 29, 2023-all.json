But its impact could be far broader, because that same infrastructure often supplies the houses and businesses of ordinary Americans, according to U.S. officials.\n\nThe first public hints of the malware campaign began to emerge in late May, when Microsoft said it had detected mysterious computer code in telecommunications systems in Guam, the Pacific island with a vast American air base, and elsewhere in the United States.\n\nMore than a dozen U.S. officials and industry experts said in interviews over the past two months that the Chinese effort predated the May report by at least a year, and that the U.S. government\u2019s effort to hunt down the code, and eradicate it, has been underway for some time. Most spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential and in some cases classified assessments.\n\nThey say the Chinese effort appears more widespread \u2014 in the United States and at American facilities abroad \u2014 than they had initially realized. But officials acknowledge that they do not know the full extent of the code\u2019s presence in networks around the world.\n\nThe discovery of the malware has touched off a series of Situation Room meetings in the White House in recent months, as senior officials from the National Security Council, the Pentagon, the Homeland Security Department and the nation\u2019s spy agencies attempt to understand the scope of the problem and plot a response.\n\nBiden administration officials have begun to brief members of Congress, some state governors and utility companies about the findings, and confirmed some conclusions about the operation in interviews with The New York Times.\n\nThere is a debate inside the administration over whether the goal of the operation is primarily aimed at disrupting the military, or at civilian life more broadly in the event of a conflict. But officials say that the initial searches for the code have focused first on areas with a high concentration of American military bases.\n\nIn response to questions from The Times, the White House issued a statement Friday night that made no reference to China or the military bases.\n\n\u201cThe Biden administration is working relentlessly to defend the United States from any disruptions to our critical infrastructure, including by coordinating interagency efforts to protect water systems, pipelines, rail and aviation systems, among others,\u201d said Adam Hodge, the acting spokesman for the National Security Council.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe president has also mandated rigorous cybersecurity practices for the first time.\u201d Mr. Hodge was referring to a series of executive orders, some motivated by concerns over SolarWinds, commercial software used widely by the U.S. government that was breached by a Russian surveillance operation, and the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack by a Russian criminal group. That attack resulted in the temporary cutoff of half the gasoline, jet fuel and diesel supplies that run up the East Coast.\n\nadministration. That exfiltration resulted in an agreement between President Obama and President Xi Jinping that resulted in a brief decline in malicious Chinese cyberactivity. The agreement has since collapsed.\n\nNow, Chinese cyberoperations seem to have taken a turn. The latest intrusions are different from those in the past because disruption, not surveillance, appears to be the objective, U.S. officials say. At the Aspen Security Forum last week, Rob Joyce, the director of cybersecurity at the National Security Agency, said China\u2019s recent hack targeting the American ambassador to Beijing, Nicholas Burns, and the commerce secretary, Gina Raimondo, was traditional espionage. But he said the intrusions in Guam were \u201creally disturbing\u201d because of their disruptive potential.\n\nThe Chinese code, the officials say, appears directed at ordinary utilities that serve both civilian populations and nearby military bases. Only America\u2019s nuclear sites have self-contained communication systems, electricity and water pipelines. (The code has not been found in classified systems. Officials declined to describe the unclassified military networks in which the code has been found.)\n\nWhile the most sensitive planning is carried out on classified networks, the military routinely uses unclassified, but secure, networks for basic communications, personnel matters, logistics and supply issues.\n\nOfficials say that if the malware is activated, it is not clear how effective it would be at slowing an American response \u2014 and that the Chinese government may not know, either. In interviews, officials said they believe that in many cases the communications, computer networks and power grids could be quickly restored in a matter of days.\n\nBut intelligence analysts have concluded that China may believe there is utility in any disruptive attack that could slow down the U.S. response.\n\nThe first hints of the new campaign by China came in May, when experts at Microsoft released some details of the malware found in Guam \u2014 home to major U.S. Air Force and Marine bases \u2014 and elsewhere in the United States. The company attributed the intrusion to a Chinese state-sponsored hacker the experts called Volt Typhoon.\n\nA warning from the Homeland Security Department\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the National Security Agency and others issued the same day said the state-sponsored hacker was able to avoid detection by blending its attack in with normal computer activity but did not outline other details of the threat.\n\nOfficials briefly considered whether to leave the malware in place, quietly monitor the code they had found and prepare plans to try to neutralize it if it was even activated. Monitoring the intrusions would allow them to learn more about it, and possibly lull the Chinese hackers into a false sense that their penetration had not been exposed.\n\nBut senior White House officials quickly rejected that option and said that given the potential threat, the prudent path was to excise the offending malware as quickly as it could be found.\n\nStill, there are risks.\n\nAmerican cybersecurity experts are able to remove some of the malware, but some officials said there are concerns that the Chinese could use similar techniques to quickly regain access.\n\nArticle continued in reply",

On top of fires associated with hitting enemy positions, they are also heavily focused on counterbattery using artillery.

Additionally, there needed to be really good coordination between forward observers and higher level headquarters and fire direction centers to keep fire going if necessary, adjust fire in case pre-plotted accuracy wasn't dead on, hit newly identified targets that the fire plan didn't account for, etc. If those two things weren't done, the attacks rarely succeeded, especially without heavy casualties.",

Whether that was out of abundance of precaution or sheer necessity is hard to say at this point, but I'd like to think it's the former. It's not even that Ukraine took the heights relatively recently, they've been in control of them for upwards of a week which is plenty of time for Russia to genuinely reassess their posture in the general area. I don't see this working too well out for Russia - the question is really why are they being so stubborn in their defence because this instance is really at odds with their general defensive doctrine. Maybe they feel their lines behind Staromlynivka are undermanned or manned with poorer/unreliable units? Hard to say at this point, but certainly something to look out for. There could also be a lack of prepared positions further down the valley - the Surovikin line starts at Heorhivka which is just over 10 clicks further south, but afterwards there are exactly three settlements for the next 30 or so KMs and this stretch ends in Zachativka which I believe is really close to the railway out of Donbas.

            "body": "Obama def got Russia wrong in hindsight, its funny how much events have proven his classic 2012 'snapback' (The Cold War wants its foreign policy back) wrong. He def botched Russia and Ukraine, though in all fairness the 2014 invasion was a difficult thing to respond to. Its easy to see in hindsight how the 2014 invasion set the stage for today, but lets accept some amount of ambiguity regarding how far and hard Russia would ultimately push. \n\nI would, however, dispute the idea they messed up elsewhere. His policy in the Middle East appears to have been mixed, not a total failure but some glaring ones. The Libyan intervention seems to have been an error. Except not a big one, as Libya basically has turned inward. The migrant crisis the war caused was painful, as was the political blowback from Benghazi. But its hard to argue that the west has become less secure thanks to it, and its hard to see what the alternative would have been in the inevitable event Ghaddafi had died in office. Its entirely probably that we would have already ended up in this position as the post-Ghaddafi leader failed to secure majority support. His record on Syria was bad if your goal was toppling Assad. But he basically set the tone (neglect) which his successors have followed. \n\nIraq, to me, does not seem to be a failure. Obama took a ton of flak for the withdraw and the subsequent rise of ISIS, but then ISIS was *not* a problem which grew up in Iraq. It was the instability in Syria that allowed ISIS room to grow and gave them a base of support, money, and trained fighters which led to the near collapse of the Iraqi government. Perhaps there would have been less lost territory, less loss in Iraqi lives, had American troops been there to save the day. But then we end up in the classic Vietnam paradox. How much money, how much blood, are the American people expected to invest to make up for Bush's mistake? Was the commitment to Iraq totally open ended? I would argue no, and so at some point the troops had to come home. Obama picked a fine time to withdraw soldiers, and IMO picked the correct response to the ISIS invasion which was to, once the Baghdad government demonstrated some viability, support the Iraqi Army with arms and airpower. It was a low investment in lives, some investment in money and support, but kept the ball squarely in Iraq's court. And it proved correct, as Iraq was able to retake the territory it had lost and restore territorial integrity. Supplying the Kurds was also a risky, but ultimately beneficial, move as it placed tremendous strain on ISIS and helped collapse its territorial control. We might bemoan the eventual betrayal of the Kurds, but it was probably overromantic to expect that they would get their own state when such dreams run contrary to the best interests of four or more regional actors (Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Syria are all disinterested in Kurdish statehood for obvious reasons). The Obama admin, AFAIK never promised post-war Kurdish statehood. So its a bad look, as Kurdish statehood is popular in the US and West, but ultimately the Obama admin made a consistent effort to let regional actors decide the regional future. Put another way, imposing Kurdish statehood would have repeated the *exact* same problem of imperialism that many say caused the current Middle Eastern crisis. Abandoning the Kurds was morally questionable, but ethically sound and strategically correct. Afghanistan is more complicated, I personally would have pushed the Biden admin to apply the same logic regarding withdraw there. And they did to an extent, but still kept enough of a toe in the pool to avoid looking like they also abandoned or lost Afghanistan. Like Bush before and Trump after, Obama policymakers really didn't have a plan for Afghanistan or a vision for the future. They just played not to lose, and let their successors take the blame for eventually withdrawing. With hindsight the right move was to withdraw in the second term, make Clinton take the political hit, and spare Biden the pain. But they could not have expected Trump to win in 2016, and so made the best choice they could for Clinton in 2016 though it eventually left Biden holding the bag. And this ignores the, IMO, correct move he made with Iran in trying to strengthen moderates and draw them away from the nuclear program and towards engagement with the west. One wonders how an Iran with something to lose economically would have played its relationship to Russia. Especially in light of Europe's need for oil, which has instead come from the Emirates. The Trump admin, in reversing JCPOA, pushed Iran into Russia's arms in ways that *might* have been avoided had they been rewarded for compliance on the nuclear issue. \n\nRegarding China, not sure what he did wrong there. Many of the seeds were harvesting today he planted in the early 2010s. Obama was oft criticized for the 'pivot to asia' by people who wanted to keep focusing on the Middle East, and the almost collapse of Iraq undermined the completeness of the Asia reorientation (but if you knock him for doing *too little* to protect Iraq, you cant then knock him for not investing enough in the Pacific, as the one policy drew resources away from the other). Obama strengthened the Navy in his second term, for example with the more expensive Ford Class and the F-35, and helped turn both the Navy and USMC from a Persian Gulf orientation towards the Pacific. A lot of the stuff he did wasn't sexy, but it formed the groundwork for what is happening today. The Obama-era Navy walked so the Biden-era Navy can run. Moreover while Trump should get credit for securing some important alliances, and Biden/Trump for the greater collaboration with Australia, much of that legwork again was done by Obama in his second term. Part of the 'Pivot to Asia' strategy was in growing closer ties to regional partners. In some cases this was stymied by lack of a catalyzing incident, as with India. And in others domestic politics in other countries prevented success, as with the Philippines. But there was a clear plan and a clear focus on developing greater regional integration with the US. The cornerstone would have been the TPP, but that got caught up and killed thanks to domestic political reasons (that is, the election of 2016). We could debate if it was *good* policy, or good for the American worker. But whats not up for debate is that it fit squarely in the mold of American post-Cold War foreign policy. It was vintage Clinton, *and* vintage Bush. So on Asia Obama, IMO, gets high marks.\n\nWhich leaves some bad, some good, some middle. You can find stuff he oversaw you like, some you hate. Its the class mark of a big shoulder shrug. He wasn't the best foreign policy president, but by far not the worst or a failure. His admin made moves and tried to control events, but misread some places (esp. Russia). It *correctly* read other places (Asia). The true judge will be what the #1 American strategic threat will be in 25 years. If it makes the Obama admin seem prescient, for example if it still is China, then he will be graded well. If its Russia, or some unknown as of yet unrecognized threat or actor, he may be graded more harshly. These kinds of historical pronouncements are very often not done objectively, but in the context of our current time. The history of foreign policy is unfortunately highly political, and moreover is driven by producing 'lessons' for contemporary policymakers. It will be a while before we can escape the 'I told you so' era historiography.",

It was a low investment in lives, some investment in money and support, but kept the ball squarely in Iraq&#39;s court. And it proved correct, as Iraq was able to retake the territory it had lost and restore territorial integrity. Supplying the Kurds was also a risky, but ultimately beneficial, move as it placed tremendous strain on ISIS and helped collapse its territorial control. We might bemoan the eventual betrayal of the Kurds, but it was probably overromantic to expect that they would get their own state when such dreams run contrary to the best interests of four or more regional actors (Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Syria are all disinterested in Kurdish statehood for obvious reasons). The Obama admin, AFAIK never promised post-war Kurdish statehood. So its a bad look, as Kurdish statehood is popular in the US and West, but ultimately the Obama admin made a consistent effort to let regional actors decide the regional future. Put another way, imposing Kurdish statehood would have repeated the <em>exact</em> same problem of imperialism that many say caused the current Middle Eastern crisis. Abandoning the Kurds was morally questionable, but ethically sound and strategically correct. Afghanistan is more complicated, I personally would have pushed the Biden admin to apply the same logic regarding withdraw there. And they did to an extent, but still kept enough of a toe in the pool to avoid looking like they also abandoned or lost Afghanistan. Like Bush before and Trump after, Obama policymakers really didn&#39;t have a plan for Afghanistan or a vision for the future. They just played not to lose, and let their successors take the blame for eventually withdrawing. With hindsight the right move was to withdraw in the second term, make Clinton take the political hit, and spare Biden the pain. But they could not have expected Trump to win in 2016, and so made the best choice they could for Clinton in 2016 though it eventually left Biden holding the bag. And this ignores the, IMO, correct move he made with Iran in trying to strengthen moderates and draw them away from the nuclear program and towards engagement with the west. One wonders how an Iran with something to lose economically would have played its relationship to Russia. Especially in light of Europe&#39;s need for oil, which has instead come from the Emirates. The Trump admin, in reversing JCPOA, pushed Iran into Russia&#39;s arms in ways that <em>might</em> have been avoided had they been rewarded for compliance on the nuclear issue. </p>\n\n<p>Regarding China, not sure what he did wrong there. Many of the seeds were harvesting today he planted in the early 2010s. Obama was oft criticized for the &#39;pivot to asia&#39; by people who wanted to keep focusing on the Middle East, and the almost collapse of Iraq undermined the completeness of the Asia reorientation (but if you knock him for doing <em>too little</em> to protect Iraq, you cant then knock him for not investing enough in the Pacific, as the one policy drew resources away from the other). Obama strengthened the Navy in his second term, for example with the more expensive Ford Class and the F-35, and helped turn both the Navy and USMC from a Persian Gulf orientation towards the Pacific. A lot of the stuff he did wasn&#39;t sexy, but it formed the groundwork for what is happening today. The Obama-era Navy walked so the Biden-era Navy can run. Moreover while Trump should get credit for securing some important alliances, and Biden/Trump for the greater collaboration with Australia, much of that legwork again was done by Obama in his second term. Part of the &#39;Pivot to Asia&#39; strategy was in growing closer ties to regional partners. In some cases this was stymied by lack of a catalyzing incident, as with India. And in others domestic politics in other countries prevented success, as with the Philippines. But there was a clear plan and a clear focus on developing greater regional integration with the US. The cornerstone would have been the TPP, but that got caught up and killed thanks to domestic political reasons (that is, the election of 2016). We could debate if it was <em>good</em> policy, or good for the American worker. But whats not up for debate is that it fit squarely in the mold of American post-Cold War foreign policy. It was vintage Clinton, <em>and</em> vintage Bush. So on Asia Obama, IMO, gets high marks.</p>\n\n<p>Which leaves some bad, some good, some middle. You can find stuff he oversaw you like, some you hate. Its the class mark of a big shoulder shrug. He wasn&#39;t the best foreign policy president, but by far not the worst or a failure. His admin made moves and tried to control events, but misread some places (esp. Russia). It <em>correctly</em> read other places (Asia). The true judge will be what the #1 American strategic threat will be in 25 years. If it makes the Obama admin seem prescient, for example if it still is China, then he will be graded well. If its Russia, or some unknown as of yet unrecognized threat or actor, he may be graded more harshly. These kinds of historical pronouncements are very often not done objectively, but in the context of our current time. The history of foreign policy is unfortunately highly political, and moreover is driven by producing &#39;lessons&#39; for contemporary policymakers. It will be a while before we can escape the &#39;I told you so&#39; era historiography.</p>\n</div>",

In 2012, neither the US nor Ukraine was in the position to engage in a conflict with Russia. Similarly, Libya was the high water mark of R2P interventionism.

Similarly, the draw back from Iraq was a natural consequence of the war, popular opinion, and the desires of the Iraqi government. Obama's unwillingness to take an aggressive stance against China and rather hold dialogues and try and bind them diplomatically through various agreements made sense at the time and honestly was the more idealistic path to handling the country and one that we should really aspire to.

Bush, thus making it possible to assess his impact on matters of concern not just to the United States but to the world. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2008/12/18/global-public-opinion-in-the-bush-years-2001-2008/\">https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2008/12/18/global-public-opinion-in-the-bush-years-2001-2008/</a></p>\n\n<p>As for your second point, Obama repairing the view of the US among Western European states, namely Germany and France, was absolutely critical for those same Western European states being willing to support the US in backing Ukraine right now. Again, I really don&#39;t see how you can argue around it. By the end of the Bush administration, European/US relations were at such an incredible low point it felt like a split was genuinely possible with everyone but Britain. Arguably one of the key reasons Putin felt enabled to act in 2008 and then again in 2012 was because of the ongoing impact of those negative relations and the Russian perception of disunity between America and Europe that Obama was still struggling to patch up (and he was obviously correct).</p>\n</div>",

It's repeated so much people think it's right, largely because of a bunch of general officers who all screwed up badly during the early OIF use it as a \"stab in the back\" type of myth to blame Bremer. \n\nBremer screwed the pooch on so many things, [CPA Order #2](https://web.archive.org/web/20040701202042/http://iraqcoalition.org/regulations/20030823_CPAORD_2_Dissolution_of_Entities_with_Annex_A.pdf) surprisingly wasn't one of them. What I'm baffled by is how nobody really thought to consider what the alternative was and then exploring that in detail.\n\nFirst off, the bulk of the military weren't a police force. That would be the actual Ba'athist aligned security forces, Saddam Fedeyeen especially, the Republican Guard, or the Special Republican Guard. The Iraqi Army was NOT considered loyal by the Saddam regime even after numerous purges (due to multiple coup or rebellion attempts). it guarded the borders. For your argument to hold water, for the US to be successful securing Post-Saddam Iraq required using the forces most loyal to Saddam, who was running the very insurgency his loyalists would then be required to squash. \n\nJust to reinterate, the argument is Bremer made a mistake disbanding the Iraqi military (not just the Iraqi Army, who were just one of the many organizations you can read listed in the PDF link above), while Saddam was still at large, and the better option was rearming and empowering the Saddam Fedeyeen, the Republican Guard, the Special Republican Guard and all those other police force units would help secure Iraq against Saddam's insurgency. \n\nYeah, that sounds like a great idea...\n\nWhen it comes to the Iraqi Army, that was a military force that had its entire officer corps fully compromised by Saddam, especially its general officer corps, through repeated purges. It was no longer respected by the Iraqi people. It was not well equipped or trained. Its discipline was extremely slack, especially because the officer corps was nearly entirely Sunni Arab (with many coming from Saddam's tribe, due to patronage), while the enlisted were nearly entirely Shi'a Arabs conscripted against their will, often threatening to kill their families.\n\nAfter April '03, the Iraqi Army essentially dissolved after the invasion. Probably something to do with Shi'a Arabs not forced anymore to serve under the ethnic officer corps tied to Saddam whose regime was just overthrown.\n\nSo if Bremer's decision was so bad, make the convincing argument that the US should go door to door through Shi'a Iraq (who make up the vast majority of the population), to forcibly re-conscript the IA deserters, force them back under arms, place then back under the leadership of Saddam loyalists Sunni Arabs, while Saddam is still on the loose. And running the insurgency.\n\nDoes that sound likely? Does that seem like it'll get popular support from the majority ethnic group, who were the ones we were trying to save from Saddam? \n\nAlso, it needs to be pointed out in the exact same order that disbanded the Iraqi military, Bremer announced the creation of the New Iraqi Corps (section 5). And anyone could volunteer (no conscripts). However, those who were war criminals were banned. Was that a bad idea too? Should they not have bothered creating new security forces loyal to the new Iraq? Or used the existing one filled with armed Saddam loyalists? While Saddam was still on the loose? \n\n>ISIS had funding from abroad\n\nISIS was formed years later. JTJ became AQI became ISI became ISIL/ISIS, became IS. \n\n It was only after many Ba'athist groups joined AQO/ISI that the former Saddam loyalists rose to high office, around 2007-2011, especially while the later IS leadership were sitting in the same detention centers as the leaders of various Ba'athist and other groups. Before that it was led by foreigners, and included almost only Salafi insurgents, not nationalists, not Ba'athists, not even the more \"moderate\" Islamic groups like IAI.",

Now everything is a disaster a decade later, sure. But is that because of Obama or what happened in the intervening years?\n\nAs I look back at Obama's foreign policy, the general theme I get from it was that he believed the US had overextended itself with its wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, exhausting the US public's interest in sinking further resources into other countries and creating distrust for us amongst our allies. I agree with both of his conclusions there.\n\nI think he made useful progress in rebuilding trust with Europeans and with things like the Iran deal, which had the potential to reduce the chaos in the Middle East. The failure to respond in Syria, Ukraine in 2014, and trying to reduce our footprint in Iraq, leading to the rise of ISIS were all failures, but they're consistent with the goal of rebuilding trust with allies, particularly Europe, because that required waiting for consensus and ending the trend of the US going off to try to unilaterally solve problems. And I think he was constrained in many of these areas by a lack of appetite for further commitments among the American people.\n\nSo I see Obama as a president during a period of American weakness in international affairs, both because America was relatively isolated and because the American people were tired of projecting power abroad, who took reasonable steps towards addressing those issues.\n\nUnfortunately, Trump's foreign policy, whatever it's benefits, did a great job of undoing all the international goodwill Obama created, pissing off Europe, plenty of other people, and causing them to further distrust the US. The result was a sort of worst of both worlds where Putin etc were emboldened by the lack of the US response to his invasions during Obama's presidency, and then further emboldened by the isolationism and conflict between the US and its traditional allies under Trump.\n\nIt's frankly a miracle that Biden was able to salvage anything and come up with the support for Ukraine that he has today. But it turns out as bad as the combination of Obama and Trump's foreign policies were for America, Putin's foreign policy was good enough for America to balance it out.",

If he says yes, NATO is at war the Russia. If he says no, give him a realistic but short timeframe ultimatum to withdraw all troops and personal from Belarus before the air campaign begins. Massive concessions will be the only thing that prevents a ground campaign to remove Lukashenko, and intervention in Ukraine.\n\nRefusal means war, because there is no way a general air campaign against Belarus doesn't end up killing Russian troops, and the only way to safeguard NATO territory would be a ground campaign taking a lot of Belarus, and if you do that, you might as well take it all.\n\n>if the response is anything less than bombing belarus, what is preventing russia from moving thousands of troops across the estonian border the next time?\n\nWell, that is the problem. \n\nWithout a massive response against even a minor incursion, the alliance is dead.

It wasn't Putin suddenly deciding \"I'm going to invade Ukraine\" out of blue. Let's not forget what happened in 2014. Putin was careful, instead of straight-up invading Ukraine, he tested the waters and staged an \"insurgency\" with a thin veneer of deniability (\"little green men\"). The terrible performance of the Ukrainian army and the weak response from the West is what emboldened him and gave him the idea that a full-scale invasion might work.\n\nUnfortunately for him, he was wrong.

Using B-2s as a reference (since B-21 is heavily classified and little has been publicly stated), B-2s can carry twice as much as B-17s could at over three times the range. But even that is misleading because of the nature of how the *armaments* themselves have changed-a B-2 can carry less and do more thanks to improved accuracy and precision. When sinking Tirpitz for example, Bomber Command required 32 Lancasters to drop as many Tallboys and scoring two hits. That 'mission' would be done by a single B-2 and without need of the fighters, tankers, SEAD aircraft that accompany non-stealth bombers. \n\nThis graphic illustrates my point \nhttps://breakingdefense.com/2017/08/stealth-add-ew-careful-planning-spoofing-intel/\nhttps://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2017/08/Bomber-fighter-chart-AFA-stealth-report-1024x706.jpg\n\nThat said, war does change priorities. If a war with China happened today, B-21 might get delayed or reduced spending based entirely on the fact the war could be over before the first B-21 flies a mission. You might see the same issue for the next JFK and Enterprise carriers, while current carriers might have some extra maintenance to make sure they get am extra year or two as they're rushed from the shipyards in then. (However feasible. Refueling and Overhaul can take2-4 years so something that's 1 year into the process might be to far in to rush. Not my expertise). In the past, HMS Vanguard was constructed because the planned Lion-classes wouldn't have finished in time for the war and Vanguard was constructed with 15-inch guns the RN had in storage. On the American side, the Independence class light carriers all came from Cleveland class cruisers because the plans drawn up would have meant no new carriers until 1944; these 9 carriers made a stopgap solution for that gap on production. (After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Essex-class carriers were given more priority such that the lead ship enters service a year earlier).\n\nI don't really have insight into what those changed priorities would look like. The Tico's that the Navy wants to decommission to save money might stay in service a few years more, and they might even use them as \"Aegis Ashore\"-like units to provide missile defense coverage to Guam, Hawaii, Okinawa if current projects aren't complete. The 4 Ohio SSGNs may also get a few more years life to act as missile trucks because of their 154 Tomahawks each, until the latest Virginia's get finished. I could also foresee the Connecticut not getting its overhaul finished if the damages are severe, simply because priority would go to finishing subs already in the shipyard. The Colombia-class can't really be delayed, but its possible. For aircraft, F-35 is in production and more money might pour in to increase production of the older F-35s (aka skip the upgrades and build more air frames).

The British desire for a carrier force remained and the QE-class dates much of its design and intents to lessons learned in the Falklands. Likewise, the Gulf War taught the US that stealth technology, missiles, and overseas military bases are all super useful. The air War over the Balkans r-enforced that stealth technology wasn't the end-all-be-all and that tactics, electronic warfare were also needed. Throughout this, everyone was also War gaming, planning, deploying, and testing. \n\nLike I said elsewhere, war planners know now they don't need thousands of bombers to be able to reliably hit targets so those funds can go elsewhere.",

Everyone (and I mean everyone) saw that CIWS were absolutely needed and rushed to finish and add projects like Phalanx to all ships. The British desire for a carrier force remained and the QE-class dates much of its design and intents to lessons learned in the Falklands. Likewise, the Gulf War taught the US that stealth technology, missiles, and overseas military bases are all super useful. The air War over the Balkans r-enforced that stealth technology wasn&#39;t the end-all-be-all and that tactics, electronic warfare were also needed. Throughout this, everyone was also War gaming, planning, deploying, and testing. </p>\n\n<p>Like I said elsewhere, war planners know now they don&#39;t need thousands of bombers to be able to reliably hit targets so those funds can go elsewhere.</p>\n</div>",

It's another to have a heavily armed ship that needs constant refueling and resupply or that can't steam across the ocean because all the conflicts the Navy has to worry over are overseas. They havent even built a dozen StG destroyers yet\n\nAnyways, the Arleigh-Burke production is going well and more are built every year. It's the reduction in small surface ships where the Navy is feeling the pain because they have to deploy an Arleigh-Burke for essentially every kind of escort mission with the Oliver Hazard Perry frigates gone and the LCS ships never intended to take over in that role. \n\nThis post was rather interesting\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/WarshipPorn/comments/ujb7l4/1452x833_us_navy_surface_combatants_19702030\n\nYou'll note that larger ships' numbers are relatively static but the small surface ships have drastically reduced in number. Those ships are less capable than the Burkes, to be clear, but cheaper (in a world where each class is more expensive than previous ones) and enable more flexibility in scheduling and planning.\n\nAs an aside, Arleigh-Burke production was supposed to stop at DDG-112, commissioned in 2012. Production was restarted due to the Zumwalt program being shuttered, and since then destroyers 113 to 123 were ordered, built and launched. The last half of those ten destroyers were \"IIA Technology Insertion\" ships aka they were given upgrades so tye jump from Flight II to Flight III for DDG-125 is less painful and slow. In other words, the Navy thought ahead and invested in making sure they could continue building more destroyers without delays or problems. Switching to adding another large surface combatant class *now* would be a bitter pill since the kinks have been worked out and money spent, and a Flight III destroyer already launched. \n\nThere was discussion of Flight IV destroyers to be procured in the 2030s. I think that was tabled because the Columbia-class ballistic missile subs have a higher (the highest priority actually) for Navy budgeting. If the Navy was really fearing for the number of missiles tubes they could use in a fleet AND the power, I think they'd have been more interested in the proposal to use the San Antonio LPD hulls as a missile ship. The size of the ship means they could have fit twice as many missiles as a StG of Arleigh-Burke, or fewer missiles with some of the larger cells needed for hypersonic missiles, plus a radar that's better than what the Burkes carry. The Japanese have solicited some designs for a twenty thousand+ warship that's comparable to this.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio-class_amphibious_transport_dock",

        "body": "Updating my post from yesterday regarding how a war between the US and China might play out. I've updated a few assumptions. \n\n1. Xi Jinping decides internally that he will use force to take Taiwan. He orders the government and the military to come up with a plan.\n2. Several weeks before the invasion, US intelligence notices that there is a large buildup in coastal regions of Fujian Province. Newly built barracks, field hospitals, supply dumps are visible via satellite. \n3. The US warns China against conducting any sort of military aggression against Taiwan, saying that the US will intervene militarily to any invasion, and harsh sanctions will be applied to cripple China's economy. The US President makes a primetime television speech appealing to China to not destroy what humanity has built up over the past century over grievances of the past. \n4. The Chinese government denies preparing for any invasion but warns the US against intervening in \"internal matters regarding Taiwan province\". \n5. The US military begins quietly activating its contingency plans to scatter its forces to make them harder to hit in case of a first strike. This includes making sure that air crews are ready at a moment's notice to evacuate their aircraft to the mainland US and other friendly countries from bases in Guam, Okinawa, Hawaii, and Japan if satellites and other early warning systems indicate that the Chinese launch ballistic cruise missiles. Components of both the Third and Seventh Fleets also scatter and set sail into the Pacific Ocean from their home bases and are instructed to maintain radio silence until the government discerns China's true intentions.\n6. The Chinese draw up a list of potential targets. Targets for a first strike include:\n\n* Taiwanese military bases, air defenses, shore batteries, navy ships, etc.;\n* Taiwanese civilian infrastructure such as undersea telecommunications cables, oil refineries and power plants;\n* US naval bases and airbases in Okinawa, South Korea, Hawaii, Guam, the Philippines and Japan;\n* Major Australian naval bases and airbases;\n* Major Japanese naval bases and airbases;\n* Any and all Australian and Japanese naval ships that can be located several hours before a missile strike;\n* Any and all US Navy ships that can be located in the Western Pacific several hours before a missile strike;\n* US and allied communication satellites;\n* Any other military targets that could be relevant to slowing down the response of the United States and its allies. \n\nBeyond immediate Taiwanese targets, the Chinese are assigning high priority to disabling US carrier groups operating in the Western Pacific. \n\nPresident Xi personally approves each target and gives his input and feedback to military planners. Thanks to a network of PLAN officers embedded within the thousands of Chinese civilian cargo ships operating all across the Pacific and armed with encrypted satellite phones, the Chinese are also able to approximate where US carrier groups are located. \n\n7. Approximately 12 hours before the strike, US intelligence surmises that a first strike will occur soon, though they cannot say when. US naval and air forces are ordered to scatter. Per the contingency plan, all aircraft that cannot be housed within a hardened bunker are urged to fly to civilian airports in South Korea, Japan, the Philippines, Australia, and the mainland United States, where small ammunition and fuel stores have been prepared. Ships within carrier strike groups at sea increase the distance between them and sail in a zigzag pattern to avoid being hit by ballistic cruise missiles. US submarines are ordered to the Taiwan Strait to interdict the Chinese invasion fleet. \n8. The Chinese launch their first strikes. The strikes prove much more devastating for the US and her allies than anticipated despite contingency planning. The Chinese knock several US communication satellites out of orbit, limiting communications and the ability of the Joint Chiefs to discern what is happening in the field. \n9. Contrary to expectations, several Chinese ballistic cruise missiles land in the Norfolk, San Diego and Puget Sound naval bases, destroying several facilities, killing dozens of personnel and also damaging the USS Harry S. Truman and the USS George Washington, two carriers undergoing repairs at Norfolk and San Diego respectively. \n10. Several carrier groups are devastated at sea, with two US carriers and several supporting vessels sunk, with most of their crews and aircraft lost.\n11. Facilities in Guam, Okinawa, Hawaii, the Philippines, South Korea, Japan, and Australia also hit with varying levels of damage. Bases at Hawaii and Guam are hit the hardest, with hundreds of personnel killed. \n12. The US manage to shoot down several cruise missiles but find that the Chinese often fire so many that some eventually find their targets. Chinese ballistic missiles are also better at finding moving targets than expected.\n13. Several Japanese and Australian Navy ships are also sunk or damaged.\n14. All in all, over 10,000 US and allied service members are killed in this first strike, with many more wounded. The US and its allies struggle to come up with a response.\n15. The US President goes on television, condemning the attack and asking Congress to pass a declaration of war against China, which Congress does. \n16. The first strike has also been devastating for Taiwan too - many of its naval ships have been sunk and numerous aircraft of its air force has been shot down or destroyed on the ground. The country is severed from the Internet, its oil refineries are on fire, and the electric grid has suffered from severe damage, causing blackouts and brownouts throughout the country. The cell phone network is barely operating. Refugees stream out of the cities and into the countryside. \n17. China calls upon Taiwan to surrender. Taiwan refuses. Taiwanese troops bunker down along the beaches, awaiting a potential invasion force. \n18. The US President and the Joint Chiefs, studying the damage, discuss potential options for a counterstrike. Despite the devastation of numerous naval bases and air bases, the sinking of many ships, the US still has plenty of forces left with which to respond. While many aircraft have been lost, enough aircraft have escaped and are now operating on civilian bases. \n19. The Chinese use their navy to blast a path through a heavily mined beaches along Taiwan's western coast. Thousands of ships carrying troops and supplies cross the Taiwan Strait. Helicopters and jets provide air cover, but the US and its allies have arrived in theater  with planes and submarines. Many planes from both sides are shot down. Many Chinese troops do not even make it to shore, they drown as their vessels sink from anti-ship missile attacks and air attacks. The Taiwanese resistance is fierce but the Chinese manage to establish a beachhead and drive off the enemy. Meanwhile US and allied air sorties decrease as they lose planes and run low on munitions. The Chinese have shifted to targeting the civilian airfields that US and allied planes are operating out of the Philippines. \n20. After a month of intense, heavy fighting that has resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians, Taiwan surrenders. China promises to rebuild the island in its own socialist image. The prestige of the US and its allies is gravely damaged, and Congress threatens the US President with impeachment over his failure to win the war. Anti-Chinese sentiment rises around the world. President Xi gives a self-congratulatory speech on state television, thanking the military for its sacrifices, and says that China has stood up to the US to regain its first place among the civilizations of the world and heralding the dawn of a new Chinese century.\n21. However, global trade and the global economy are devastated. Much of the world, including China, plunges into an economic depression. The US cuts off all trade ties with China, causing a scarcity of Chinese-consumer made goods at home. But many Americans do not mind, because China is now such a toxic word to many. Entrepreneurs step into the fold with more expensive consumer goods sourced from Mexico and elsewhere.",
