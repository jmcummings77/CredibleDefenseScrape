      "selftext": "The r/CredibleDefense daily megathread is for asking questions and posting submissions that would not fit the criteria of our post submissions. As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster. Don't abuse it though! If something is not obviously against the rules but you still feel that it should be reviewed, leave a short but descriptive comment while filing the report.",

Because Israel subscribes to the rule of law, more or less, they can't evict the entire Gaza population and there is nowhere to evict them to in any case. But they can displace them within Gaza, and that is what I expect they will try to do. If they divide the strip into multiple parts then they may forcibly migrate the population from part to part, clearing the depopulated parts and filtering out possible Hamas soldiers as they go. Thus dancing around the borders of what might be considered genocide.\n\nTo implement any such plan, IDF must enter and at least partially occupy Gaza, a massive and dangerous undertaking that will require considerable preparation to implement relatively bloodlessly.\n\nCaveat: I doubt they know what they are going to do themselves, much less a random bystander such as myself.

Because Israel subscribes to the rule of law, more or less, they can&#39;t evict the entire Gaza population and there is nowhere to evict them to in any case. But they can displace them within Gaza, and that is what I expect they will try to do. If they divide the strip into multiple parts then they may forcibly migrate the population from part to part, clearing the depopulated parts and filtering out possible Hamas soldiers as they go. Thus dancing around the borders of what might be considered genocide.</p>\n\n<p>To implement any such plan, IDF must enter and at least partially occupy Gaza, a massive and dangerous undertaking that will require considerable preparation to implement relatively bloodlessly.</p>\n\n<p>Caveat: I doubt they know what they are going to do themselves, much less a random bystander such as myself.

Like\n\nTwo million people trapped with no way out? I really can't see the public opinion favoring israel then, especially with all of the history already present.

If successful, this operation will feel good and temporarily weaken Hamas, but it will not destroy the organization.  The organization will inevitably regenerate.  Not a long term solution.\n\nTo actually destroy an organization like Hamas, one would need to destroy one of the following - **their blood, their leadership, or their gear**.\n\n1) **Blood**\n\nThere are 2 million residents in the Gaza strip.  A huge fraction are young unemployed males that hate Israel.  Realistically, Israel can\u2019t and won\u2019t destroy this population base through eviction/killings.  For a variety of reasons.\n\nSimilarly, they can\u2019t really kindly convince all of those people to demobilize.  Not this century.  \n\nWhich leaves as the only option a Xinjiang-style arrangement where these people are processed and re-processed until no resistance remains.  While less impossible than the other two options, this is still probably beyond Israel\u2019s capabilities.  \n\n2) **Leadership**\n\nSome of Hamas\u2019 leadership within Gaza can be killed.  However, even if Hamas is totally defeated, their leadership will likely manage to flee to Qatar or Iran, preventing the destruction of the organization.  Israel has the capability to assassinate people in those nations, but they may not elect to do so.\n\nThe only other way to disrupt leadership is to arrange an NK-style total permanent communications blackout in Gaza.  That way, leadership that\u2019s safe in Tehran can\u2019t actually plan operations.  However, not only is this of questionable feasibility, it also might not be enough, since couriers could probably perform the same role.\n\n3) **Gear**\n\nThe final (and most plausible, imo) way to destroy Hamas is to destroy all of their gear, and make it impossible for them to regenerate it.\n\nMost of their gear and supplies come from Iran.  Will Iran stop being willing to fund Hamas for as long as the organization is viable?  Absolutely not.  So to stop gear regeneration, you\u2019d have to stop gear from entering Gaza.\n\nThis isn\u2019t trivial, but I feel like this is the most realistic path.  If Israel takes a small strip in south Gaza (cutting it off from Egypt), they could take over all customs and tunnel destruction.  It\u2019s believable they\u2019d manage to interdict enough supplies together with their naval efforts to eventually render Hamas non-viable.\n  \nMind, this is still not an easy plan, but I think if Israel wants to do more than suppress Hamas and actually destroy it, this is the plan most aligned with their capabilities.",

They are a metastasizing cancer like any radical revolutionary ideology, like the Marxists of the last century. This isn&#39;t some UAE that just wants to sit there and get rich on oil and tourism. It&#39;s an ideological regime with a vision, which is much more dangerous for both the region and the world.</p>\n\n<p>But sure, it&#39;s those crafty Jews pulling the strings of America. Where have I heard that trope before?</p>\n</div>",

We may not have the same shia militias running around there, true, but those only underscore my point that Iran is a malign regional actor.

Though you also won't find me defending our course of action during the second Obama term, frankly I think that was the period of the US's greatest foreign policy errors partially resulting in today's world, though I would argue that it was his excessive desire to disengage, \"lead from behind\", and naivete that resulted in these things. A persistent western presence is needed, it can't just be air support and weapons shipments. And for the Syrian rebel groups, yeah the state department was wearing its pants on its head when it came to classifying groups, though I'd argue America's policy there was a result of its own stupidity rather than anyone's influence, since the Israelis didn't seem all too keen on several of our decisions regarding Syria.\n\nYemen's civil war is heavily financed, supplied, and aided by Iran and it's proxies. And Saudi Arabia understandably would not want a neighboring state to become an Iranian proxy, call it their version of containment.\n\nThe point of all this is to say, I agree with you that the US does not always make the best decisions for regional stability, but I'd argue that most of these actions seem reactive in nature rather than proactive (with the exception of the second gulf war). The US is often responding to revolutions or insurgents or regional conflicts, and it's response will somewhat depend on whether the white house is occupied by realists, neoconservatives, or liberal internationalists.

Occupying an urban prison of 2 million people is hardly sustainable and once the immediate anger fades, many Israelis will not want their kids to be risk getting maimed or killed trying to keep a restive population of 2 million under control. </p>\n\n<p>If Israel moves into a ground invasion, and let&#39;s say they depose of Hamas, then what is the next move? Many other groups will just take their place because as long as Gaza is under massive economic blockade by Israel, the population will be resentful. Ethnic cleansing is just a fantasy.

Any recovery operation before the full or partial occupation of the strip would likely look very familiar to Operation Gothic Serpent (Mogadishu); however, against a much more competent, prepared, alert, and larger force.\n\nInsertion by helicopter would be very challenging, due to not just the Biblical volume of small arms (not even considering dedicated anti-aircraft) fire but also due to how cramped/dense the buildings are. It would be very hard to insert a sizeable direct action force and a significant security force. If you were to try and ram your way in by road, the hostages would likely be moved through the vast tunnel networks *if* **any** of you actually even managed to get there.\n\nAfter inserting, the force would then have to make it to the target. Hypothetically, if this was in a very urban portion of Gaza City, they would perhaps have to fight down a tower and into then into a byzantine tunnel system. A truly high casualty and fraught undertaking, even if any hostages are both alive and not relocated by the time they get to the bottom.\n\nFinally, at the point of egress, essentially every gun, MANPADS, and angry person in the city would be rushing towards the extraction zone. This wouldn't just be a mission destined for failure, but also very likely to entirely lead to the deaths of anyone involved.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEntebbe worked in part due to the limited number of enemy combatants (Ugandan & Palestinian), the airfield's relative isolation from supporting forces, the \"central storing\" of the hostages, and the easy ingress/egress that came with it being at an airfield. With good intelligence, there still could be some successful raids of opportunity if hostages are stored in more accessible and less dense parts outside of Gaza City (i.e. the farms, in the south), but this isn't a reliable way to resolve the issue. In addition, it's very likely that the kidnapped Israelis will be kept dispersed in order to make one great rescue impossible.\n\nIn. my opinion, gainful attempts at rescue could only happen after the strip (or a portion thereof) is preliminarily pacified.",

If the author really did interview several people, surely there'd be more stories? Instead, the anecdote starts with \"I saw a video of \\[Noa Argamani\\]\" and ends with \"Women have been raped next to their friends\".\n\n1.1) Noa Argamani being transferred to the motorbike was when the unit had detached from its main assault body and has reached Gaza proper. You can see this from how the sunlight looks like it is late evening, how nobody has the distinctive white headbands and it's a bunch of kids surrounding them. We also later have photos of Noa Argamani relatively untouched in Palestinian captivity.\n\n1.2) It really sounds, to me, that the interviewee was not actually there and is just repeating hearsay.\n\n2) From the looks of the operation, they were a well trained outfit with one specific goal in mind: take hostages and spread terror. Stopping to rape women is completely besides the point, you're wasting time letting people escape. This pattern was also not repeated in the other Kibbutz's - for example, the video with the woman holding her 2 sons, the family of 4 who were taken hostage, among others.\n\n3) We do not know if the woman who was dragged by the hair into the pickup was actually assaulted. We can see soiling in the pants, a very common reaction for humans in terror. It could be blood, and it's very possible that it did happen, but to me, I am confused why they would bother putting her clothes back on if the intent was to parade her like that.\n\nIn conclusion, I think the massacre did happen and a lot of civilians were killed, however the author of this piece has added rape to stir more outrage amongst readers for a greater emotional response. I could of course be full of shit and the atrocities did take place, but to me, this reads more like a semi piece than an actual factual retelling of events.",

Also COVID.</p></li>\n<li><p>The US tells South Korea (one of the countries that has the money) to let Iran have access to its money, which amounts to 6 billion dollars.</p></li>\n<li><p>The US restricts Iran to only use the money for humanitarian reasons and nothing else (because that was what Iran said).</p></li>\n<li><p>This was a part of a prisoner swap deal where the US gave Iran Iranian prisoners and Iran gave the US American prisoners.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It&#39;s Iran&#39;s money anyway so Biden hasn&#39;t &quot;given&quot; anything, not really.</p>\n</div>",

We've let our production and procurement stagnate for close to thirty years at this stage and it's really starting to show.   \n\n\nFFG(X) and DDG(X) are both replacement programs that should be well on their way to maturity at this stage and instead neither have started full bore mass production. FFG(X)/Constellation is finally in production but DDG(X) isn't set to enter production until 2028 at the earliest, and if it goes anything like the navy's last clean sheet destroyer design, it's going to have issues.  \n\n\nHopefully we wake up a bit faster and realize how crucial long term investment is. For far too long now we've invested in the wrong areas and it's coming back to bite us in the ass. There's a lot to be said for maintaining a large industrial base, particularly in the naval category as our current shipyards deal with extremely predictable order quantities and as such (predictably) have stagnated to provide just enough capacity for that, with no flexibility for ramp up.   \n\n\nNot sure if you saw my post a few days ago about LRASM procurement, but essentially the USN's current position against the PLAN is rather dire, in wargames they expect to expend anywhere between 800-1200 LRASM's as part of a combined approach with other munitions and strategies to defeat the PLAN and make supplying Taiwan untenable.   \n\n\nProblem is there are only 200 of those currently in inventory and by the end of 2028 there will be less than 500 additional units delivered. Each year deliveries are set for approximately 100 units which is a shockingly small number of missiles for a navy that is expecting to have a near peer/peer engagement in the next decade.  \n\n\nAnd in those wargames the LRASM's ran out long before the PLAN was defeated anyway and assumed current day fleet composition, which will not be the case as the years march on and the PLAN continues to get larger.   \n\n\nSo we're in a very poor position when it comes to an engagement with China, the rather scary thing is that LRASM missiles have a 20-24 month lead time for production, so even if we did get embroiled in a conflict, the opportunity of getting sizeable munition quantities in anything resembling an acceptable timeframe is basically off the table.   \n\n\nHopefully things will change over the next year or so as lessons from Ukraine are learned in earnest, but my bet is that we'll continue to sit mostly on our laurels and be \\*shocked\\* in a few years time when the PLAN outnumbers the USN in critical hull categories such as Destroyers, they doubled the size of their destroyer force in just 5 years, they have more than enough shipbuilding capacity to go even further than that in the next five if they really wanted to...",

The Jews were almost wiped out in the holocaust? Explain then why the population of jews has almost recovered to pre-war levels.\n\n3. Comparing a blockaded strip of land where only the most bare necessities are allowed in to Singapore, really? And the single Egypt - Gaza crossing allows people only. All cargo must go through Israel.\n\n4. Can the creation of entire states and the moving around of millions really be justified on thousand year-old claims? Should the UN intervene against France to facilitate the rightful settlement of Celtic peoples back to their homeland, Gaul?\n\nI am going to add this segment to keep it credible.

Hamas is in control of Gaza it is the gov. Sure some Nazis didn't support the massacre of every Jew, does not make the support for Nazis any less a problem.\n\n\n\nYou prove my point, did you read your own article:\n\n>When Israel first encountered Islamists in Gaza in the 1970s and '80s, they seemed focused on studying the Quran, **not on confrontation with Israel.$* The Israeli government officially recognized a precursor to Hamas called Mujama Al-Islamiya, registering the group as a **charity.** It allowed Mujama members to **set up an Islamic university and build mosques, clubs and schools**.\n\n>When it became clear in the early 1990s that Gaza's Islamists had mutated from a religious group into a fighting force aimed at Israel -- particularly after they turned to suicide bombings in 1994 -- Israel cracked down with ferocious force.\n\nSo Jews lived in Palestine, good. They have a right for a state where they are not genocided.\n\nPalestinians refused that and opened a genocidal war which they lost.\n\nWe seem to be in agreement on the sequence of events, but your conclusion is that Jews should have just let Arabs massacre them?",

Last time Israel annexed East Jerusalem after the 6 days war, and even then offered to give Arab parts to the Palestinians in 2008.</p></li>\n<li><p>Egypt is blockading Hamas, because they don&#39;t want to support literally ISIS. It has nothing to do with Israel. If the Palestinians didn&#39;t want to be blockaded by Arab Muslim brethren, try to done down your mix of Nazism and ISIS.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Ukraine does not have Nazi battalions, can you give me an example of a Ukrainian battalion massacring entire villages of civilians. Hamas is in control of Gaza it is the gov. Sure some Nazis didn&#39;t support the massacre of every Jew, does not make the support for Nazis any less a problem.</p>\n\n<p>You prove my point, did you read your own article:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>When Israel first encountered Islamists in Gaza in the 1970s and &#39;80s, they seemed focused on studying the Quran, <strong>not on confrontation with Israel.$* The Israeli government officially recognized a precursor to Hamas called Mujama Al-Islamiya, registering the group as a **charity.</strong> It allowed Mujama members to <strong>set up an Islamic university and build mosques, clubs and schools</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>When it became clear in the early 1990s that Gaza&#39;s Islamists had mutated from a religious group into a fighting force aimed at Israel -- particularly after they turned to suicide bombings in 1994 -- Israel cracked down with ferocious force.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So Jews lived in Palestine, good. They have a right for a state where they are not genocided.</p>\n\n<p>Palestinians refused that and opened a genocidal war which they lost.</p>\n\n<p>We seem to be in agreement on the sequence of events, but your conclusion is that Jews should have just let Arabs massacre them?</p>\n</div>",
