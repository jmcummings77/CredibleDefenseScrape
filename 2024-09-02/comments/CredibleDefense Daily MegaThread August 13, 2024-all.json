Claimed captures include 20 vehicles, a large number of motorcycles, 138 Kalash and 580 magazines, 2 Dragonovs, 53 PKM, 26 RPG-7 launchers with 83 rockets, 4 60mm mortars, and lots of ammunition. To support this they published a photoset included in the tweet. [Additional photo of magazine pile](https://x.com/SaladinAlDronni/status/1823397817601142980). [Some footage from the attack here](https://x.com/SimNasr/status/1823427437423943959) gives an idea of the terrain, lots of concealment very close to the road and the road is also narrow and poor quality making it very difficult for the column to continue if lead elements are halted. The PKMs are interesting because [JNIM likes to mount them to motorcyles](https://x.com/SimNasr/status/1819830533838520562) providing quite a lot of firepower given the mobility of the platform. \n\nThe impact of this attack is multi-part, in addition to the direct impact of the lost men and equipment a similar attack back in June in Mansila when a barracks was overrun lead to rumors of regime instability and Wagner forces were flown in from Mali to shore things up in Ouagadougou. Further, as insurgent forces deprive the government of the proceeds from the gold mining operations it threatens to severely impact the government's ability to continue to finance itself.

Since the start of the war there has been talk of allowing foreign qualified pilots to fly in the conflict either individually or more formally in an AVG type scheme. Now that Ukraine is actually receiving F-16s it seems like we can dust off that discussion. There is of course a long history of foreign pilots flying in conflicts.

He does not have the authority the greenlight US or other NATO fighter pilots joining the conflict alone. Infantry is one thing, those tactics are public knowledge and an Army 11B or Marine 0311 wont be privy to sensitive information. But a USAF F-16 pilot is a different matter. They are cleared and privy to classified information including, but not limited to, technical details of the F-16 and weapons as well as doctrine and tactics. Ukraine has been allowed access to some of this out of necessity of operating Vipers but they wont know all of it. Suffice it to say, a qualified pilot trying to join on their own initiative would find themselves in prison pretty quickly. So has the State department changed its position? Or is Graham grandstanding. What about other F-16 users? The US might not allow it but many nations operate the platform. Has anyone else formally allowed their pilots to join?",

On top of that, Russia is increasingly reliant on infantry assaults with minimal or even no armored support against highly fortified Ukrainian positions, which have proven extremely costly.\n\nI think it's clear that Russia saw the period after the failed Ukrainian 2023 offensive as one of great opportunity, and they've been throwing everything they have at Ukraine for nearly a year, hoping to identify and exploit weak points in the line and pressure Ukraine to the point of collapse. In doing so, they've lost massive quantities of men and materiel, expended vast quantities of ammunition (borrowing from NK and Iran to cover the expenditure), and overheating their economy in the process. But Ukraine hasn't broken, and instead Russia was caught unprepared for a bold Ukrainian operation to capture Russian soil.\n\nTaken altogether, I get the sense that Russia was doing everything in their power to make extensive gains in 2024, putting their long-term stability and war sustainment efforts at risk, with the hope of a Trump victory that would likely pressure Ukraine to make major concessions to end the conflict in 2025 on favorable terms for Russia.

Sinwar and his brother are probably the only two remaining masterminds of the 7 Oct attacks. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Citing a \u201cresponsible security source in Hamas,\u201d the Saudi-owned Al Arabiya news outlet said Monday that the Hamas informant was responsible for passing along written messages from the head of the group\u2019s Rafah Brigade Muhammad Shabana to other senior Hamas members.</p>\n\n<p>Hamas leaders in Gaza are believed to be communicating throughout the war via written messages delivered by couriers in order to avoid being tracked by Israel.</p>\n\n<p>The informant linked to Deif\u2019s assassination was subsequently caught and was being interrogated by Hamas, the Al Arabiya report indicated.</p>\n\n<p>The courier told Hamas interrogators that his Israeli handler had shown him a picture of Deif and ordered him to report back if he ever saw the Hamas military chief. The courier confessed to having spotted Deif while transferring messages on July 13 and having immediately informed his Israel handler. The IDF carried out the strike minutes later, the report said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Japan's current defence budget was allocated under the assumption of significantly more favorable JPY/USD conversion, which leaves them with a significant shortfall [to the tune of 30%](https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Defense/Japan-defense-spending-plan-takes-30-hit-from-weak-yen). Conditions have improved slightly in the past few weeks following aggresive BoJ intervention, but the yen is still far below projected values.\n\n> In December 2022, as part of its new National Security Strategy, the Japanese government allocated a defense budget of 43 trillion yen (about $300 billion at the time) for the next five years, a 60% increase from previous levels. A significant budget portion is dedicated to big-ticket military hardware, such as purchases from the the U.S. of Tomahawk cruise missiles and advanced F-35 fighter aircraft. These acquisitions help Japan achieve counterstrike capabilities and promote peace in the Indo-Pacific region. However, these big-ticket items are predominantly priced in dollars.\n\n> But the sharp devaluation of the yen has significantly eroded purchasing power. Despite a historic interest rate hike by the Bank of Japan in late July, the yen remains weak against the dollar. This means hardware costs have soared and Japan can no longer afford many planned purchases. While some may argue that the currency devaluation was an unforeseeable shock, it was preceded by severe financial missteps that left Japan's defense ambitions highly vulnerable. For example, during defense budget planning, the exchange rate was questionably underquoted at 108 yen to the dollar, far from the then-rate of approximately 135 yen to the dollar, and a rate that had not been seen for over a year. The yen slumped past 160 to the dollar early last month and is now around 145 -- and remains volatile. It is unclear how policymakers intended to fund the undermarked items within the budget.\n\n> Compounding the problem, the Japanese Ministry of Defense does not hedge against currency risk, despite managing a budget comparable to a large multinational corporation.

According to a recent Nikkei poll, the prime minister's rating plummeted to a new low of 25%, marking a trend of historic unpopularity. This decline follows an unprecedented corruption scandal involving senior government members running a slush fund scheme.

The situation at the Polish and Lithuanian borders has brought a whole lot of surveillance effort into the area, so whatever intel gathering they do on that border seems to be enough for them right now. We've still got pretty clear sources on pretty much everything Russia is planning, with exception of the FSB and Putin himself. And we know what Putin wants too.

Clearly there's something going on here beyond just blacks wanting to end segregation: if America just handed blacks a couple of states like Virginia, they wouldn't use them to try to kill whites every chance they got.\n\nThis is.... not entirely accurate. It's often asserted that Hamas was simply left to its own devices in Gaza, but that's never really been the case.

Mr. Netanyahu has consistently placed all blame for the deadlocked negotiations on Hamas, even as senior members of the Israeli security establishment accused him of slowing the process himself.\n\n> But in private, Mr. Netanyahu has, in fact, added new conditions to Israel\u2019s demands, additions that his own negotiators fear have created extra obstacles to a deal. According to unpublished documents reviewed by The New York Times that detail Israel\u2019s negotiating positions, Israel relayed a list of new stipulations in late July to American, Egyptian and Qatari mediators that added less flexible conditions to a set of principles it had made in late May.\n\n> Among other conditions, the latest document, presented to mediators shortly before a summit in Rome on July 28, suggested that Israeli forces should remain in control of Gaza\u2019s southern border, a detail that was not included in Israel\u2019s proposal in May. It also showed less flexibility about allowing displaced Palestinians to return to their homes in northern Gaza once fighting is halted. Some members of the Israeli negotiating team fear that the new additions risked scuppering the deal, according to two senior officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.\n\n> The Times reviewed the documents and confirmed their authenticity with officials from Israel and other parties involved in the negotiations.\n\nNetanyahu, of course, denies it all.\n\n> At a meeting on Aug. 4 with cabinet ministers, Mr. Netanyahu said that Israel had \u201cnot added even a single demand to the outline\u201d and that \u201cit is Hamas which has demanded to add dozens of changes.\u201d Yet, in a letter to mediators on July 27, the Israeli negotiation team added five new qualifications to the outline of a deal that it had proposed exactly two months earlier, on May 27.\n\n> One of the most contentious additions was the inclusion of a map indicating that Israel would remain in control of the border between Gaza and Egypt, an area known as the Philadelphi Corridor. By contrast, Israel\u2019s proposal in May had suggested that troops would leave the border zone. It pledged the \u201cwithdrawal of Israeli forces eastwards away from densely populated areas along the borders in all areas of the Gaza Strip.\u201d\n\nThis may or may not be related to the [recent statement from Iran to hold off retaliating if a ceasefire was reached](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/only-gaza-ceasefire-can-delay-irans-israel-response-sources-say-2024-08-13/). \n\n> Only a ceasefire deal in Gaza stemming from hoped-for talks this week would hold Iran back from direct retaliation against Israel for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on its soil, three senior Iranian officials said.",

Not sure why you think Ukraine won't be able to send or maintain reinforcements or why you think Ukraine will try to hold the ground to the last man in a costly suicide mission. \n\nThe second scenario is pretty vague but seems to imply that Ukraine will quickly cede territory, and the 3rd is pretty implausible based on how the rest of the war in Ukraine has unfolded. \n\nPersonally, I think the most likely scenario is that Ukraine consolidates its positions in Kursk in the coming days and slows or stops efforts to expand the salient. They then pull most of their \"elite\" units like the air assault formations back and use them more conservatively, such as to launch counterattacks against Russian efforts to retake ground, while they quickly fortify the territory they hold and use TDF and mechanized units to actually man most of the fortifications. Chances are they'll hold the ground stubbornly to inflict heavy losses on Russian forces trying to recapture their territory, much like they've done elsewhere in Ukraine.",

Not sure why you think Ukraine won&#39;t be able to send or maintain reinforcements or why you think Ukraine will try to hold the ground to the last man in a costly suicide mission. </p>\n\n<p>The second scenario is pretty vague but seems to imply that Ukraine will quickly cede territory, and the 3rd is pretty implausible based on how the rest of the war in Ukraine has unfolded. </p>\n\n<p>Personally, I think the most likely scenario is that Ukraine consolidates its positions in Kursk in the coming days and slows or stops efforts to expand the salient. They then pull most of their &quot;elite&quot; units like the air assault formations back and use them more conservatively, such as to launch counterattacks against Russian efforts to retake ground, while they quickly fortify the territory they hold and use TDF and mechanized units to actually man most of the fortifications. Chances are they&#39;ll hold the ground stubbornly to inflict heavy losses on Russian forces trying to recapture their territory, much like they&#39;ve done elsewhere in Ukraine.</p>\n</div>",

The Taliban was an insurgency and they did not force the US to withdraw through attrition. That aside, this strategy is a double-edged sword. The Russians have already been forcing Ukraine to &quot;expend massive effort to hold ground&quot;. &quot;Painful losses&quot; is relative; Ukraine and Russia have different thresholds for what they can &quot;afford&quot; to lose relative to their own materiel and manpower pools.</p>\n</div>",

You are **really** leaning hard into this instance of surrender. Did those Russians surrender after being encircled?  Maybe you aren't too familiar with conventional warfare, but fighting to the death while encircled is not at all common, even from motivated soldiers. Go look at encirclements in WW2 Eastern Front that yielded tens of thousands of surrendering soldiers, even though both sides absolutely hated the other. Mariupol had Azov sitting in a very hardened location that they had been fortifying for weeks beforehand. Azov had plenty of munitions and supplies to hold out in a heavily fortified position, circumstances which the Russian garrison likely did not share. On top of that, Azov was made up of some of the most nationalistic Ukrainians; they're hardly comparable to Ukrainian conscripts.\n\nThis has been a very \"static\" war thus far so it should not come as a surprise that there haven't been encirclements that would yield surrenders.\n\n>The level of motivation is obviously apparent. For you to simply handwave that away because of nothing more than \"well Russia has more people\" is silly.\n\nHave you just memory-holed all the reports from late 2023/early 2024 about the reluctance of the general Ukrainian population to throw themselves into a meatgrinder? You act like it's still 2022 when the Ukrainian were fresh off the Kharkiv offensive. There's a reason Ukraine had to resort to conscription and convicts: morale isn't great in Ukraine, either.\n\n>There is no tangible reason to believe Russia is going to be able to sustain its army better than Ukraine.\n\nI don't really see either side having a decisive morale advantage at the moment. That's why I fall back on potential manpower. All other things being equal, Russia has a manpower advantage. I don't believe Ukraine's morale is so much better as to nullify that advantage.",

Causing inflation and labour shortages, not exactly burning.\n\nWithout getting into all the other parts of this I would like to point out that there is GDP and then there is GDP. Sure GDP numbers look good if you are paying people to do things, but paying them to make stuff that will then get destroyed in a war and also you lose a lot of people in the process is the financial equivalent of paying lots of people to make a great big pile of money, telling them to get on top of it and then you light it all on fire. It's not exactly what you would call a long term growth strategy. \n\nAll that GDP number is doing is showing us all the government spending going on, but that government spending is not to build roads, or airports or universities to train higher paid workers etc. It's malinvestment. This is the point that people don't really understand on a macro economic level about what is happening in Russia. The Inflation and labor shortages are indicators of the limits of inputs that Russia has to economically sustain the war.

Sure GDP numbers look good if you are paying people to do things, but paying them to make stuff that will then get destroyed in a war and also you lose a lot of people in the process is the financial equivalent of paying lots of people to make a great big pile of money, telling them to get on top of it and then you light it all on fire. It&#39;s not exactly what you would call a long term growth strategy. </p>\n\n<p>All that GDP number is doing is showing us all the government spending going on, but that government spending is not to build roads, or airports or universities to train higher paid workers etc. It&#39;s malinvestment.
