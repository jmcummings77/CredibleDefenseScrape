We've got Finland sending. **We've got an awful lot of Vikings now in England. It didn't bode well a few hundred years ago when that happened. It's sort of repeat now.

        "body": "Some thoughts from a Polish guy who volunteered for 3 weeks as an instructor in Ukraine:\n\n**1.**\n\n> Another trip to Ukraine is behind me. This time I went for a longer time to help train the volunteers who power the Ukrainian army.\n\n> Before I left, I had contact with the lady who manages the volunteers. I wrote to her what I can train (shooting, general infantry training, weapon handling, tactics, etc.) and to my question \"what is the main field of training, because I can take a lot of things useful in training\", I got the answer \"take everything!\". So, as I guessed, everything is missing \ud83d\ude42. And so it was also on the spot.\n \n> So I borrowed a VW T4 bus from my father, packed steel targets in large quantities, paper targets (silhouettes), takers, timers, whistles, 400 sand bags, spades, observation scopes, sprays in various colors, mountaineering equipment, a lot of powertape , riflescopes, targeting lasers, night vision and thermal imaging etc. In addition, own personal protective and tactical equipment and everyday items for over 3 weeks.\n\n> I started on Thursday afternoon because I was still waiting for a courier who was supposed to deliver things for the boys from the 3rd SSO Brigade. So I got to the border late at night. Crossing the border was only a formality, but right after passing the first block posts I had to stop because it was already past the curfew, and I felt too much sleepy myself. Wake up in the morning and then to the unit in which I was supposed to report to help with the training. Somewhere along the way, using the New Post Office, I send parcels that go to other directions.\n\n> On the spot, I met a lady with whom I had previously spoken on the phone, including two Americans, one Canadian, translators and the battalion commander. We said hello right away and started talking about training needs. It turned out very quickly that the battalion had recently left the front, they were there for about 3 weeks, of which a week on the 1st line, where during that one week they had losses of several dozen people. They got supplements, they are already two weeks in the base, now it's time for intensive training.\n\n> Due to the fact that I just arrived, and the training was already underway, we decided that in the first week I would join the program organized by one of the Americans, i.e. the sharpshooter training. Due to the fact that the guys from the unit had AK74 and RPK74, we will initially conduct training on this. The main sergeant of the battalion and the deputy for training give us a blessing to use a part of the training ground for our exclusive use, a lot of ammunition and give us all the snipers from the battalion. The training is scheduled to start on Monday, and it is Friday. I walk with one of the Americans on a unit, meet people, ask about their experiences, needs, etc. This particular American was at the front with our battalion and tells me what the fight was like there. In general, they rarely used personal weapons, while everyday artillery fire and bombing from airplanes were involved. Our battalion is a new unit, so they had no artillery assigned, so they could not respond to the fire in any way, and due to the lack of any PLOT measure, they were not able to shoot down the plane. In general, they sat in trenches, watchtowers, in advanced positions, and sometime during this week on the front line they made a night raid to a nearby village to destroy the enemy position that harassed them, and there was a fight between and in the buildings. And that was one of the few opportunities to use carbines at all.\n\n> On Saturday, we decide to jointly organize training in the use of night vision and thermal imaging (because we have no better idea how to organize this day anyway). We start in the afternoon shortly before sunset. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this equipment, we give our soldiers access to our night vision in various terrains, we try to find people at various distances through thermal imaging and many other things. The training is for volunteers who have never dealt with such equipment, but there are also some experienced soldiers who share their insights from the front. For example, it is worth having even a small thermal imaging monocular with you to be able to find a hot barrel that shoots at you from somewhere hidden. Later we check it and even on not very expensive monoculars you can clearly see the barrel glowing in the thermal imaging, which heats up to over 100 degrees when shooting. It is true that it is often one \"hot\" pixel, but it attracts attention.\n\n> On Sunday, soldiers have a day off, so we visit the city, drive around the training ground and discuss the details of the training.\nOn Monday morning we start with a lecture on the role of a sharpshooter in a team / platoon, tasks, equipment, ammunition, etc. After all, we take all the weapons that we have and that the soldiers brought (many of them had their private repeaters, AR15, AR10 or other constructs) and each of them learns how to handle, fold and unfold different firearms. For some of them it is just a repeat, for others something completely new.\n\n> I will not focus on all the details of the training, but in the following days we shoot a lot at the training ground. From 25m to 500m with both instruments and optics. My most important contribution to the training is the planning and implementation of blastfree training. So what to focus on in shooting-free training, how to conduct such training to be the most effective, how to train the components of shooting accuracy in a time regime, what are the time standards for performing shooting exercises, etc. We often discuss whether a given method was used somewhere on the front and how it will affect the individual skills of each soldier\n\n> By the way, we talk about the experiences of the boys who have collected from the beginning of the conflict. Some of them served in different places, so I have the opportunity to gather experience from various sections of the Ukrainian front since the beginning of the war. I mainly learn the accounts of people serving in the territorial defense of Kiev, around Kiev, from the northern (Kharkiv) and eastern (Irpien) fighting regions. The conclusions are as follows:\n- friendly fire - due to the lack of coordination and the distribution of weapons at the beginning of the conflict, very often firing on their own units, officers were able to leave their units, spread unnecessary panic among their units (a 14-kilometer column of tanks is going to us, we will die!), very often due to some personal animosities (or suspicions that someone might be a traitor) someone did not inform someone that the sub-units were to come into contact and, for example, during the exchange in the trenches, their own forces were shot at the battle stations. Another interesting topic is the lack of compliance by the civilian population with the curfew and the related shooting at the civilian population (there is a soldier at the checkpoint, there were already sabotage and special groups in Kiev at that time, in the darkness of the night after 10 p.m. he is bumped into Another boy, staring at the phone and having headphones on his ears, starts to run scared, he does not hear any Stop commands! We will shoot! And a tragedy occurs)\n- lack of awareness of the soldier and informing him of the details of the task - there are often situations that ordinary soldiers hear the order \"Pack your bags, we are leaving for a combat task\" but where they are going, what are they going for, what they will do, what enemy is waiting for them, it is already secret! It is the cutting off of the simple soldier from the necessary information that makes the soldier fight worse. The reason for this action? Because there may be traitors \ud83d\ude42 (if there is a suspicion of treason or ordinary paranoia, why build such sub-units and send them to fight?)\n- lack of basic infantry training for each soldier - most of the volunteers who joined the war on the day of the invasion on February 24 had little or no military training, resulting in many losses related to the lack of proper entrenchment skills, the lack of safe use of weapons that could be avoid\n- no local recognition slogans and radio communication - there was a lack of recognition slogans and radio communication, which often resulted in the enemy crossing lines and friendly fire\n- the lack of a training system and standards - this is what any organized system hurts for. If there are no clear and simple procedures that are constantly updated with the experience gathered, we do not really know which way we are rowing. So we're not getting anywhere.\n\n> In the following days, engineering training in planning and defending the prepared team / platoon is successfully completed. Digging in the field has never been fun and easy, but it is a very important training! We discuss their comments on this topic, we try to judge each subsequent trench whether it is well dug, masked, etc. I fly a drone over their trenches and show them how their defensive positions look from above, we discuss how artillery affects defensive positions, what protects , and what does not. Valuable, and for some it is the first trench they have ever dug in their lives! There are many detailed conclusions from soldiers who were already at the front about the construction of defensive lines. They sleep in trenches at night. Several such trainings can be completed, unfortunately not everyone is eager to dig, and when it rains, this motivation decreases to zero. Unfortunately, everyone has only one uniform issued, and the battalion commander cannot afford a massive cold among the soldiers.\n\n2nd comment was automatically deleted for some reason, but it's available here:\n\nhttps://www.reveddit.com/v/CredibleDefense/comments/wlpnea/credibledefense_daily_megathread_august_11_2022/ijymyjj/",

            "body": "**2.**\n\n> In the following days, we play teams and platoons in the attack, during the attack with the use of combat ammunition. We also used the support element for the machine gun section and RPG7 grenade launchers in the training. And all this together with the maneuvering element in the form of a platoon consisting of three teams in the offensive. Somewhere on the way I am doing a small combat course in the city like in the good old shooting days. In general, there are many needs, even more conclusions. The time during the training passes quickly, some of the instructors leave us, at the same time others come to stay in the battalion for a longer period of time on the contract. After 3 weeks of work, I say goodbye and come back to myself with many handshakes and contacts. It was a mega good and upbuilding time. It is good to see that the quality of the Ukrainian soldier is increasing day by day. From numerous stories it appears that the orcs are not so well trained and equipped. Only quality can we win this conflict!\n\n> Conclusions for us Poles who want to be ready for the war with the orcs. They are not arranged, I tried to score what is often in our training:\n\n> 1. It is often said about preparing reserves before the war, that we will have time for that, that the reunion of sub-units will take place before the war, etc. etc. NONSENSE! Within 5 months, Ukraine appointed about 500-600 thousand people to various forces and state security services. There is no training force that will manage to prepare and coordinate such a large number of people for such a complicated thing as an armed conflict in such a short time. And this is seriously not about training specialists such as radar station service or fighter pilot (although of course such people are necessary in a conflict!). It's all about basic infantry training. What is such basic training? These are topics such as: executive discipline, SERE, navigation, battlefield engineering, explosives training, cloaking, infantry tactics from steam level to platoon level during attack and defense, information discipline, communication, WMD preparedness training, drone training, shooting from various types of weapons that the infantry platoon uses (carbines, machine guns, sniper rifles, anti-tank grenade launchers, AA launchers). For such training, as many armies of the world have managed to convince, you need to spend at least 3 months of real training. But it has to be carefully planned and implemented training, not what our army serves for the most part. Unfortunately, our army does not give us such opportunities, we have to train and play ourselves. And so, in the event of a war, the same army will hire us full-time, fill our receipts, arm us, uniform, show us how not to kill ourselves and send us to the front. This will be the sad reality. If the army cannot, and often does not give the trainers the opportunity to, carry out the basic training correctly, how is the same army supposed to do it during preparations or already during the war? At a time when the most experienced staff will be at the front or will take part in fights. Anyway, it is not a question of experienced staff, because Ukrainian experiences say the same. An experienced soldier is not necessarily a teacher. Teaching methodology is not reading from the outline sheet or standing in front of the sub-unit and talking about your experiences. It is a planned exercise of certain exercises, from the most simple to the complex ones. You also have to train yourself, otherwise your ass is beaten. It is the ability to build a training program from such different elements to reach a diverse student. Different people accept information differently, so some people get a model example, others get thousands of repetitions, and the last one is reading a manual or watching a movie on YT. Any method is good as long as it hits your head. But for this to happen, there is a need for trainers, teachers who, supported by experienced soldiers, will conduct the training.\nI do not know if you paid attention, but in the training topics listed there is no singing, drill and civic education. Yes, they are just a waste of time \ud83d\ude42.\n\n> 2. Absolutely nothing when it comes to tactical equipment. There are not many things in Ukraine, such as plugs, goggles, ballistics, specialist ammunition or night vision. Everything has to be brought from Europe, and what is on the shelves disappears in a moment. And when there is something, it is often 4 times higher than our prices. Also, if you do not have a gadget for your weapon, it will simply be extremely difficult to access during the war. Also, have the best equipment that you can buy, because there is no war with us and we have time to save money. During the war, the warranty does not work.\n\n> 3. Gaining experience on blood. It often takes time to practice certain elements of tactical solutions. It is a matter of checking it first dry, then with combat ammunition, and then with the use of ASG, UTM, FX or other ammunition, thanks to which you can fight a real opponent in a real fight to check whether the given elements of our tactic plan work. Even playing some computer games that are supposed to simulate reality, such as Arma or VBS, is better than having no such experience at all before starting a real fight and a clash with an opponent. Someone will probably say that it will be completely different in a real war. \ud83d\ude42 Why practice anything at all, if it will be different in the war. Anyway, it has been proven more than once that introducing simulation elements to any training is better than repeating patterns hundreds of times. Often, in my training, I first introduced a small element of the clash with the opponent so that we could immediately draw conclusions together with people and to show where the end point of our training is. It has to be if more people are to go home alive and well. Unfortunately, we do not have it! And even if it is, it is on such a small scale that it is difficult to translate it into the entire army. In Ukraine, a new sub-unit is very often sent to the front right away so that it can immediately get the correct experience and know the direction in which the training must go. Brutal, but in reality, when it is not known who needs good training and equipment most, it is the best means of verifying valuable people.\n\n> 4. Drones. This war and the previous one in Karabakh showed clearly that not only military but also civilian drones are something that completely changes the battlefield. These drones on our side must be present in mass numbers, I am tempted to say that each section of four people has its own drone! This is a very good identification measure, every soldier should at least get to know the drone a little and be able to use it safely. Unfortunately, in Poland, flying ordinary civilian drones over the training ground is forbidden because it is a military area\u2026. And the soldier must know what his unit looks like from above, what its position looks like when viewed from a drone. These are mega important conclusions. And here, seriously, it is not often about mega-complicated drones with software that detects motion, or drones with thermovision (although these experiences are very important). This is often about the Mavic Mini that comes from the enemy's position to assess the situation in advance, plan an attack or an artillery strike. Of course, during a conflict, such a civilian drone must be prepared for use in the environment of interference stations, but this is a topic for a separate argument.\n\n> 5. Telephones. Information security in the form of ensuring the dissemination of information via smartphones is a mega-important issue. These are often simple things like turning airplane mode on or off your phone. Or one of such good practices is the use of a Signal type application, from a phone that is in flight mode and is connected to the WiFi network set in the base, and the antenna is thrown 300m behind the base. Using Messenger in the trenches is seriously not a good idea. Taking photos of yourself at every possible second of the training, showing the entire environment where you can walk to where the soldiers are, is also not the best idea. When you take a photo, make it so that you can see the grass or the sky, make a print screen from the photo itself and then send it to your friends. Yes, a rocket launched from a submarine at sea can reach the coordinates or surroundings found in the Instagram photo.\n\n> 6. Everything you do during training you must be able to do in the absence or limited light and / or with the use of night vision. Because night is an ally. And it must be the natural fighting environment.\n\n> 7. Mass of wounded and killed. Each battlefield medicine course must include elements of wound selection and care for multiple wounded. Modern artillery and other heavy weapons make lightly wounded during operations a daily bread, so not only self-help, but also the ability to help many of your colleagues. And these are often situations where you just have to say to someone \"get an internship!\" or take the dressing out of his medicine cabinet, because injured people are often in great shock.\n\n> 8. Long distances in combat. The closest line of enemy fortifications is often 800-1200m. Think about it the next time you practice shooting at 100m with a super tactical rifle \ud83d\ude42. I am not talking about the fact that such a rifle is unnecessary because there are fights at closer distances, e.g. in the city, but it is about the statistics of the use of this type of weapon. The closest point in case the sub-unit breaks up or leaves the lap is a minimum of 15 km. With a backpack, with a heavy load because you take mortars and ammunition and you have to go fast because if you fail, they will lock you in a lap.",

These are topics such as: executive discipline, SERE, navigation, battlefield engineering, explosives training, cloaking, infantry tactics from steam level to platoon level during attack and defense, information discipline, communication, WMD preparedness training, drone training, shooting from various types of weapons that the infantry platoon uses (carbines, machine guns, sniper rifles, anti-tank grenade launchers, AA launchers). For such training, as many armies of the world have managed to convince, you need to spend at least 3 months of real training. But it has to be carefully planned and implemented training, not what our army serves for the most part. Unfortunately, our army does not give us such opportunities, we have to train and play ourselves. And so, in the event of a war, the same army will hire us full-time, fill our receipts, arm us, uniform, show us how not to kill ourselves and send us to the front. This will be the sad reality. If the army cannot, and often does not give the trainers the opportunity to, carry out the basic training correctly, how is the same army supposed to do it during preparations or already during the war? At a time when the most experienced staff will be at the front or will take part in fights. Anyway, it is not a question of experienced staff, because Ukrainian experiences say the same. An experienced soldier is not necessarily a teacher. Teaching methodology is not reading from the outline sheet or standing in front of the sub-unit and talking about your experiences. It is a planned exercise of certain exercises, from the most simple to the complex ones. You also have to train yourself, otherwise your ass is beaten. It is the ability to build a training program from such different elements to reach a diverse student. Different people accept information differently, so some people get a model example, others get thousands of repetitions, and the last one is reading a manual or watching a movie on YT. Any method is good as long as it hits your head. But for this to happen, there is a need for trainers, teachers who, supported by experienced soldiers, will conduct the training.\nI do not know if you paid attention, but in the training topics listed there is no singing, drill and civic education. Yes, they are just a waste of time \ud83d\ude42.</p></li>\n<li><p>Absolutely nothing when it comes to tactical equipment. There are not many things in Ukraine, such as plugs, goggles, ballistics, specialist ammunition or night vision. Everything has to be brought from Europe, and what is on the shelves disappears in a moment. And when there is something, it is often 4 times higher than our prices. Also, if you do not have a gadget for your weapon, it will simply be extremely difficult to access during the war. Also, have the best equipment that you can buy, because there is no war with us and we have time to save money. During the war, the warranty does not work.</p></li>\n<li><p>Gaining experience on blood. It often takes time to practice certain elements of tactical solutions. It is a matter of checking it first dry, then with combat ammunition, and then with the use of ASG, UTM, FX or other ammunition, thanks to which you can fight a real opponent in a real fight to check whether the given elements of our tactic plan work. Even playing some computer games that are supposed to simulate reality, such as Arma or VBS, is better than having no such experience at all before starting a real fight and a clash with an opponent. Someone will probably say that it will be completely different in a real war. \ud83d\ude42 Why practice anything at all, if it will be different in the war. Anyway, it has been proven more than once that introducing simulation elements to any training is better than repeating patterns hundreds of times. Often, in my training, I first introduced a small element of the clash with the opponent so that we could immediately draw conclusions together with people and to show where the end point of our training is. It has to be if more people are to go home alive and well. Unfortunately, we do not have it! And even if it is, it is on such a small scale that it is difficult to translate it into the entire army. In Ukraine, a new sub-unit is very often sent to the front right away so that it can immediately get the correct experience and know the direction in which the training must go. Brutal, but in reality, when it is not known who needs good training and equipment most, it is the best means of verifying valuable people.</p></li>\n<li><p>Drones. This war and the previous one in Karabakh showed clearly that not only military but also civilian drones are something that completely changes the battlefield. These drones on our side must be present in mass numbers, I am tempted to say that each section of four people has its own drone! This is a very good identification measure, every soldier should at least get to know the drone a little and be able to use it safely. Unfortunately, in Poland, flying ordinary civilian drones over the training ground is forbidden because it is a military area\u2026. And the soldier must know what his unit looks like from above, what its position looks like when viewed from a drone. These are mega important conclusions. And here, seriously, it is not often about mega-complicated drones with software that detects motion, or drones with thermovision (although these experiences are very important). This is often about the Mavic Mini that comes from the enemy&#39;s position to assess the situation in advance, plan an attack or an artillery strike. Of course, during a conflict, such a civilian drone must be prepared for use in the environment of interference stations, but this is a topic for a separate argument.</p></li>\n<li><p>Telephones. Information security in the form of ensuring the dissemination of information via smartphones is a mega-important issue. These are often simple things like turning airplane mode on or off your phone. Or one of such good practices is the use of a Signal type application, from a phone that is in flight mode and is connected to the WiFi network set in the base, and the antenna is thrown 300m behind the base. Using Messenger in the trenches is seriously not a good idea. Taking photos of yourself at every possible second of the training, showing the entire environment where you can walk to where the soldiers are, is also not the best idea. When you take a photo, make it so that you can see the grass or the sky, make a print screen from the photo itself and then send it to your friends. Yes, a rocket launched from a submarine at sea can reach the coordinates or surroundings found in the Instagram photo.</p></li>\n<li><p>Everything you do during training you must be able to do in the absence or limited light and / or with the use of night vision. Because night is an ally. And it must be the natural fighting environment.</p></li>\n<li><p>Mass of wounded and killed. Each battlefield medicine course must include elements of wound selection and care for multiple wounded. Modern artillery and other heavy weapons make lightly wounded during operations a daily bread, so not only self-help, but also the ability to help many of your colleagues. And these are often situations where you just have to say to someone &quot;get an internship!&quot; or take the dressing out of his medicine cabinet, because injured people are often in great shock.</p></li>\n<li><p>Long distances in combat. The closest line of enemy fortifications is often 800-1200m. Think about it the next time you practice shooting at 100m with a super tactical rifle \ud83d\ude42. I am not talking about the fact that such a rifle is unnecessary because there are fights at closer distances, e.g. in the city, but it is about the statistics of the use of this type of weapon. The closest point in case the sub-unit breaks up or leaves the lap is a minimum of 15 km. With a backpack, with a heavy load because you take mortars and ammunition and you have to go fast because if you fail, they will lock you in a lap.</p></li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

UA had the ability to learn from them. Senior leadership either make time, while reducing optempo, emphasizing economy of force and force preservation. Or else they get rightly insulted for incompetently trying to do too much with too little and treating their troops like cannon fodder. \n\nUkraine hasn't been suffering a national emergency since mid March. Before that, when the fate of the whole country came down to needing TDF to help block Russian attacks in key strategic areas, fine. They have to use what you got, and if it's shit due to lack of preparation then they're stuck with that. But even then untrained troops should be used in reserve roles only, doing extremely simple tasks. Secondary efforts, NEVER main efforts. \n\nBut that emergency ended when the Russians retreated from the Kyiv front and the whole theater calmed down minus the Russian offensive in the Donbas, a location of no real strategic importance other than political optics. \n\nMeanwhile, the UAF GenStab voluntarily launched a counteroffensive against Kharkiv in mid April, another counteroffensive in the Kherson bridgehead in late May, many small counterattacks in Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk oblasts on the Land Bridge, and are now saying a massive strategic counteroffensive has already started intending to liberate the entire south. All while prosecuting a \"Not a Step Back\" strategic defensive policy in Donbas while telling everyone is a maneuver defense.  It's not.\n\nAfter the emergency ended in March was when they had the time to pull the TDF off the lines, either discharge them (bad decision) or train them as their next wave of mobilization. Meanwhile they could have extended training for everyone else not already committed. Even the Red Army in 1941-2 did that every time a major disaster was temporarily alieviated, they went back to longer training. Not the UAF though, for almost six months they've been totally okay with abysmal training, three weeks or often none, before feeding those poor unfortunate bastards into the meat grinder. They took high casualties. Is that a surprise? \n\nEven what you posted earlier confirms the issues. They barely know how to dig proper defensive positions, and are reluctant to dig because it's tiring and they get muddy. And their commanders won't press it thinking like 19th century quacks that wet/cold equals sick troops. Nope, but shitty defensive positions against an enemy relying on massed fires equals heavy casualties. Poor discipline equals heavy casualties. Bad leadership (who likely aren't properly trained themselves) equals heavy casualties. Etc. They're causing their own heavy attrition, which requires more cannon fodder to replace them, who are easily killed or wounded because they're clueless, who then need more cannon fodder to replace them, etc. It's an endless cycle until enough senior officers are relieved for cause and new ones replace them, because the current crop are the ones who thought that was a war winning strategy: they NEED to go.\n\nIn the battle of the Donbas, barely or untrained TDF were still prioritized in main effort locations over active duty units, put on the front lines while better units were used in the tactical and operational reserve, sent from other regional operational commands to reinforce OC-E and the JFO versus better units. It was a deliberate choice, TDF were expendable, use them up as they can be replaced in less than three weeks. \n\nEven the former UAF colonel that was on this [Geopolitics Decanted podcast](https://geopolitics-decanted.simplecast.com/episodes/analysis-of-the-war-in-ukraine-august-3-2022) admitted to it. Worsen, he even said he was smiling while stating it, as if the UAF did something smart by sending cannon fodder to hold the Donbas. And not ten minutes later he has to admit the UAF still has no clue how to conduct counteroffensives and are under-equipped too. So what exactly did that purposeful use of cannon fodder prove? \n\nNote, I want Ukraine to win but I expected so much better of them, especially after all the bragging by various US govt and mil individuals about all the training we did with them, how we reformed their military, etc. Meanwhile, they perform as if they're the Red Army in 1941-2 or the Wehrmacht in 1944-5.",
                                        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>there was simply no time to properly train enough people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is no doubt how the UA leadership and UAF GenStab view things but it&#39;s a bullshit answer.</p>\n\n<p>Again, this isn&#39;t the first war that ever happened, we have a century plus of modern warfare to pull from where other countries have suffered similar issues and made varying choices, some good some bad. UA had the ability to learn from them. Senior leadership either make time, while reducing optempo, emphasizing economy of force and force preservation. Or else they get rightly insulted for incompetently trying to do too much with too little and treating their troops like cannon fodder. </p>\n\n<p>Ukraine hasn&#39;t been suffering a national emergency since mid March. Before that, when the fate of the whole country came down to needing TDF to help block Russian attacks in key strategic areas, fine. They have to use what you got, and if it&#39;s shit due to lack of preparation then they&#39;re stuck with that. But even then untrained troops should be used in reserve roles only, doing extremely simple tasks. Secondary efforts, NEVER main efforts. </p>\n\n<p>But that emergency ended when the Russians retreated from the Kyiv front and the whole theater calmed down minus the Russian offensive in the Donbas, a location of no real strategic importance other than political optics. </p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the UAF GenStab voluntarily launched a counteroffensive against Kharkiv in mid April, another counteroffensive in the Kherson bridgehead in late May, many small counterattacks in Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk oblasts on the Land Bridge, and are now saying a massive strategic counteroffensive has already started intending to liberate the entire south. All while prosecuting a &quot;Not a Step Back&quot; strategic defensive policy in Donbas while telling everyone is a maneuver defense.  It&#39;s not.</p>\n\n<p>After the emergency ended in March was when they had the time to pull the TDF off the lines, either discharge them (bad decision) or train them as their next wave of mobilization. Meanwhile they could have extended training for everyone else not already committed. Even the Red Army in 1941-2 did that every time a major disaster was temporarily alieviated, they went back to longer training. Not the UAF though, for almost six months they&#39;ve been totally okay with abysmal training, three weeks or often none, before feeding those poor unfortunate bastards into the meat grinder. They took high casualties. Is that a surprise? </p>\n\n<p>Even what you posted earlier confirms the issues. They barely know how to dig proper defensive positions, and are reluctant to dig because it&#39;s tiring and they get muddy. And their commanders won&#39;t press it thinking like 19th century quacks that wet/cold equals sick troops. Nope, but shitty defensive positions against an enemy relying on massed fires equals heavy casualties. Poor discipline equals heavy casualties. Bad leadership (who likely aren&#39;t properly trained themselves) equals heavy casualties. Etc. They&#39;re causing their own heavy attrition, which requires more cannon fodder to replace them, who are easily killed or wounded because they&#39;re clueless, who then need more cannon fodder to replace them, etc. It&#39;s an endless cycle until enough senior officers are relieved for cause and new ones replace them, because the current crop are the ones who thought that was a war winning strategy: they NEED to go.</p>\n\n<p>In the battle of the Donbas, barely or untrained TDF were still prioritized in main effort locations over active duty units, put on the front lines while better units were used in the tactical and operational reserve, sent from other regional operational commands to reinforce OC-E and the JFO versus better units. It was a deliberate choice, TDF were expendable, use them up as they can be replaced in less than three weeks. </p>\n\n<p>Even the former UAF colonel that was on this <a href=\"https://geopolitics-decanted.simplecast.com/episodes/analysis-of-the-war-in-ukraine-august-3-2022\">Geopolitics Decanted podcast</a> admitted to it. Worsen, he even said he was smiling while stating it, as if the UAF did something smart by sending cannon fodder to hold the Donbas. And not ten minutes later he has to admit the UAF still has no clue how to conduct counteroffensives and are under-equipped too. So what exactly did that purposeful use of cannon fodder prove? </p>\n\n<p>Note, I want Ukraine to win but I expected so much better of them, especially after all the bragging by various US govt and mil individuals about all the training we did with them, how we reformed their military, etc. Meanwhile, they perform as if they&#39;re the Red Army in 1941-2 or the Wehrmacht in 1944-5.</p>\n</div>",

The article talks about 2/3 of coal deposits. Most of Ukraine's natural gas, oil and metals are still under Ukranian controlled territory and not in the Donbas at all. \n\nFurther, let's talk about the general gist here. Venezuela has $30 trillion of oil reserves. Most O&G analysts think those proven reserves represent only ~50% of what the country actually has. That's roughly $60 trillion in **just** oil reserves. You know...that's Venezuela. The country where for over 8 years, people have had to **barter for toilet paper**. \n\nAnd one could say, \"nah, that's just Venezuela -- they've been economically mismanaged and sanctioned to hell.\" True. Let's look at other resource countries then. South Africa is probably the fifth most resource rich country in the world, behind Russia, Canada, Brazil and Australia (note: resource rich here doesn't just mean the amount of proven reserves you have, but also the diversity of your reserves. Why? Because commodity prices fluctuate, so if you just go by the total of any one commodity, like oil, the number is less reliable for analysis purposes). Seeing that you're from the continent, I'm pretty sure you would agree that you don't want to live in South Africa, unless you own a literal gold mine, either. \n\nOn a per capita basis (which is probably the more relevant metric), Guyana is set to become one of the most oil rich countries in the world. For a population of less than a million, they're going to be pumping close to 1.5mmbpd of just oil pretty soon. Guess what: pretty sure you don't want to live in Guyana either. And to be clear - that's **actual production** and **not** reserves. Most reserves, as the WP article you linked states as well, are rarely ever realized. \n\nAnd you can just go down the list. Most sub-Saharan African countries, on a PPP basis, are the most resource rich countries in the world. Yet, they lag on every economic index. Now, are there mitigating circumstances? Absolutely. Slavery tends to fuck things up for a long time. If you talk to people who operate in the natural resource world, they'll all tell you that Papua New Guinea is the new Eldorado. Yet, the country remains severely underdeveloped. Again, yes, mitigating circumstances. Not denying that. \n\nBut, the concept of a resource curse is also well understood.

The Netherlands benefits from having a smaller relative population, so food exports are higher relative to their own production. Second, they export higher value products, where they enjoy a higher unit price per kilo of export, mostly because of historical reasons. Third, they are in markets where they can levy some level of pricing power, as opposed to Russia that exports base commodities. Fourth, they benefit from good environmental factors. And in a distant fifth is the point of human resources: they have better tech and training. \n\nAlso, here\u2019s a bit of advice: don\u2019t make sweeping statements like that. \n\n> This doesn't mean resources aren't extremely important.\n\nAnd who said they weren\u2019t?

The Netherlands benefits from having a smaller relative population, so food exports are higher relative to their own production. Second, they export higher value products, where they enjoy a higher unit price per kilo of export, mostly because of historical reasons. Third, they are in markets where they can levy some level of pricing power, as opposed to Russia that exports base commodities. Fourth, they benefit from good environmental factors. And in a distant fifth is the point of human resources: they have better tech and training. </p>\n\n<p>Also, here\u2019s a bit of advice: don\u2019t make sweeping statements like that. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This doesn&#39;t mean resources aren&#39;t extremely important.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And who said they weren\u2019t?

            "body": "In general I do not expect to see a return to any form of remarkable maneuver warfare.  Russia has suffered heavily in their capabilities and have apparently also learned their lessons from the early war. Ukraine has similarly lost a lot of maneuver ability and would be foolish to venture into range of Russian airforce (despite the deserved mockery they have received, they are more than capable of stopping Ukrainian armored thrusts into territory covered by Russian AA.\n\nThis in large means the following months will be similar to the past months. A war of attrition, positional battles, artillery duels, missile-strikes and sabotage/SOF raids into the rear of enemy.\n\nPositional warfare does not mean that there is no movement or offensive actions. But the offensives will be tactical in scale, fought over tactically and operationally important objectives. \n\nWhether it is about bridgeheads around rivers like Inhulets in Kherson and Sievierski Donets in Izjum-Slavjansk-Siversk direction, or numerous villages, towns and urban areas on all fronts.\n\nI do not expect Russia to have the force to conduct offensive actions of even moderate success. But they will keep trying to apply pressure in different parts of the line of contact. I wager that Russia values maintaining control over Kherson and the south as more important that concluding the occupation of Donbas. Luhansk is functionally fully occupied, while the rest of Donetsk is out of reach for Russian forces. So I predict that Russia will prioritize the forces in the south over those still fighting in Donbas. Relatively and to a degree.\n\nRussia might try to take initiative in the south to improve their positions for defensive purposes, but I do not believe they will try some big new push there.

I wager that Russia values maintaining control over Kherson and the south as more important that concluding the occupation of Donbas.

Because of the fluctuating troop concentrations and with Kherson being more important, I could actually see the Bahmut line falling to Russia in the coming months, but it depends on just how much Ukraine can commit to the line in the middle of the Kherson offensive and whether or not Russia can conjure up even just a few thousand more men, it would be a minor victory for Russia with Ukraine withdrawing to Kramatorsk, continuing to hold a secure position in Donetsk.\n\nAt this point I don't see Russia really pushing for Zaporizhzhia or Kharkiv even if somehow everything else would be working out for them, the obstacles to overcome are simply too much for the current Russian Army.\n\nI would also love to hear more talk regarding the whole artillery duel aspect of the war which seems to have quickly become unimportant.

Because every class is designed differently, it emits a unique spectrum of acoustic noise. Well trained sonarmen might identify *some* of these factors, but these days powerful computers do a lot of the heavy lifting of ship identification. These days powerful microphones pick up, record, and analyze basically every sound a ship or sub picks up. Then it compares those sounds to those on records, and with the help of a sonarmen categorizes them first into natural/unnatural, then into civilian/military, and lastly into combat relevant information (class, speed, bearing, depth, etc.) \n\nFriendly fire is always an issue, and misidentifications are ever possible. The ocean is a noisy place, and of course humans always make mistakes.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Each ship design has a unique acoustic signature dictated by the number and size of propellor blades, the size and construction of the power unit (including nuclear reactors) and other unique factors like the vibration of the drive shaft or the flow of water over the propellor. Because every class is designed differently, it emits a unique spectrum of acoustic noise. Well trained sonarmen might identify <em>some</em> of these factors, but these days powerful computers do a lot of the heavy lifting of ship identification. These days powerful microphones pick up, record, and analyze basically every sound a ship or sub picks up. Then it compares those sounds to those on records, and with the help of a sonarmen categorizes them first into natural/unnatural, then into civilian/military, and lastly into combat relevant information (class, speed, bearing, depth, etc.) </p>\n\n<p>Friendly fire is always an issue, and misidentifications are ever possible. The ocean is a noisy place, and of course humans always make mistakes.

There is a ton of forgiveness for loans and situations where if it was a debt trap they could have acted harshly also the loans not forming a significant enough size of for example Nigerias economy.\n\nThe mood for many people is that China sees African nations as business partners to help with good deals and that there has been clear benefits to development.\n\nThe \u201cdebt trap\u201d thing is basically westerners convincing themselves of negative press that has been spread about something people appreciate.\n\nLikewise so much press is given to how evil Wagner are behaving in African nations but the issue is a lot of people actually support the fact Russia is offering training to the military. The west ( America) won\u2019t touch the country because of human rights or corruption  issues with the government but many people are happy that a perceived stronger nation is stepping in to help the government fight against insurgents. \n\nI\u2019ve seen interviews and when asked the people were like \u201c I\u2019m glad they\u2019re here helping the situation\u201d. \n\nI remember I saw a news video and the interviewer was grilling the Russian official pushing the war crimes and atrocities angle but all they were showing is a training mission where they were helping train soldiers.

                    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I\u2019m firmly pro Ukrainian but as someone who is of different ancestry I\u2019m amazed how much of a disconnect some westerners have with Africa for example.</p>\n\n<p>Any time China comes up all I hear is people say it\u2019s colonisation blah and \u201cdebt trap\u201d meanwhile mainstream outlets have long explained that it\u2019s a myth for example Bloomberg:</p>\n\n<p>\u201c<a href=\"https://youtu.be/_-QDEWwSkP0\">https://youtu.be/_-QDEWwSkP0</a></p>\n\n<p>For sake of brevity I won\u2019t explain it fully- basically it\u2019s not true. There is a ton of forgiveness for loans and situations where if it was a debt trap they could have acted harshly also the loans not forming a significant enough size of for example Nigerias economy.</p>\n\n<p>The mood for many people is that China sees African nations as business partners to help with good deals and that there has been clear benefits to development.</p>\n\n<p>The \u201cdebt trap\u201d thing is basically westerners convincing themselves of negative press that has been spread about something people appreciate.</p>\n\n<p>Likewise so much press is given to how evil Wagner are behaving in African nations but the issue is a lot of people actually support the fact Russia is offering training to the military. The west ( America) won\u2019t touch the country because of human rights or corruption  issues with the government but many people are happy that a perceived stronger nation is stepping in to help the government fight against insurgents. </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019ve seen interviews and when asked the people were like \u201c I\u2019m glad they\u2019re here helping the situation\u201d. </p>\n\n<p>I remember I saw a news video and the interviewer was grilling the Russian official pushing the war crimes and atrocities angle but all they were showing is a training mission where they were helping train soldiers.

It cost them say, $X to bring relatively good working equipment out of storage and get it combat ready, but the further they go into the warehouse the more it costs to get older equipment up and running again.  </p>\n\n<p>All these things add up very very fast, even if they seem small in isolation.</p>\n</div>",

Obviously we're not in a shooting war with China, so it's a few live-fire exercises (some of which are escalatory, like exercises to the east of Taiwan) and the suspension of some international cooperation and economic ties is not the \"doomsday ww3\" some media outlets were saying it would be. \n\nThe US probably took two things away from the crisis: \n\n1. If you're in Congress, or if you're Pelosi, you're going to say \"look China made a bunch of insane threats and screamed and threw a tantrum and then when it comes down to it? *They really didn't do very much at all.\"* So it's likely you're going to have a bunch of people saying \"oh China's a paper tiger, Russia can't even defeat Ukraine, China's not going to get into a conflict with the US, their threats are meaningless.\" (and you can see these reactions in this thread). This reaction probably emboldens members of congress to do more of these kinds of things and overtly support Taiwan. Pelosi likely also thought that deterrence was eroding and thus her trip would strengthen deterrence and security, but I think that without increasing Taiwanese capabilities on the ground, this basically expands the security dilemma and further erodes deterrence rather than encourages it (after all, Pelosi didn't bring a bunch of missiles in her suitcase). \n2. If you're in the White House, you probably think \"yes we didn't end up in a conflict with China, but this was still a high risk, low upside event (what if there was an accident?) that has raised tensions.\" But in the long-run? There's fear this is leading us somewhere with no good outcome. If you follow the chain of logic in 2, there's *concern* that this is leading us to a place where the Chinese believe the US is giving up on the 72 and 79 agreements (although some Americans would say China already broke those agreements anyway). If you think that both sides are walking away from the core agreements that have sustained peace in the region then it's *more likely* that this visit accelerated / encouraged that process and China may engage in a major operation in the coming years as they feel they have no other option. \n\nAnyway, it's too early to tell what the overall outcome is. From my perspective, this was a visit that had very low potential upside and very high potential downside for a number of reasons (timing, for example, the party congress coming pushes Xi into a corner and he must show resolve in the face of \"American aggression\").",
