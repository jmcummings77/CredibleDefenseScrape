Close quarters suicidal charge with explosives, followed by an RPG attempt, before the attackers retreat into the tunnels. Not sure what the guy is saying as he makes the charge, but [I have been told that it's apparently this particular verse](https://myislam.org/surah-yaseen/ayat-9/).\n\nCaption by the account is obviously not relevant, the video is interesting for a tactical insight. The caption also gets something wrong in that it does not show *one* person doing all this, it shows at least two with the RPG being fired by the blurred blue guy, and possibly a third for the final clip.\n\nCaveats: it's obviously been edited quite a bit, as a propaganda piece, and we can't tell how effective the attack was in this case. However, the final clip does show *something* being picked up, which would indicate something got blown off. On the other hand, the fact that the camera does not pan over to show a destroyed Merkava should be considered telling, and the final clip is absolutely taken quite some time later. To my knowing-very-little-about-merkava eye, it just looks like a side skirt or something, hardly evidence of a destruction. Again, I think its interesting for giving us some insight into tactics, rather than being Real Evidence Of Merkava Weakness or something.\n\n[The video](https://twitter.com/itranslate123/status/1720171043988381861), and [alternate link for people not using twitter](https://nitter.net/itranslate123/status/1720171043988381861).",

Not only is it showing a general thaw in relations diplomatically following the nadir of the Pelosi-Taiwan visit, it also represents an opportunity for them to create an agreement on nuclear weapons that is tailored to their specific strategic relationship.

The Bohdan Chmelnytsky battalion, named after a Ukrainian Cossack leader, consists of 70 to 80 captured Ukrainian servicemen, according to Russian state media. They will soon be sent to the front in Ukraine, according to Moscow.\n\n\nUsing prisoners of war for military purposes goes against the Geneva Convention, which is the basis of humanitarian law of war. \"Prisoners of war may not be forced to do military or dangerous work,\" dictates the 1949 convention text.\n\nBut, the commander in charge earlier claimed to Russian state news agency Ria Novosti, the dozens of Ukrainians have reported \"voluntarily.\" They are also said to have accepted Russian passports. \"I took an oath to Russia because I want Ukrainians and Russians to be united as one people,\" a defector droned on in an interview published yesterday.\n\nEstablishing that humanitarian law of war is being violated is difficult, says associate professor of international criminal law Marieke de Hoon. \"How do you determine whether someone defected entirely voluntarily, or whether there was coercion or brainwashing? Or that it's the only chance to avoid torture or worse?\"\n\nRussia is estimated to be holding several thousand Ukrainian POWs. \"It may be the case that someone actually wants to defect and Russia is providing that opportunity,\" De Hoon said. The American think tank ISW assumes that the POWs were \"presumably forced\" into conscription.\n\nTricky split\n\nThe deployment of Ukrainian POWs is not an isolated case. After the illegal, unrecognized annexation of the occupied regions, it became possible to draft Russia's \"new\" population into the army, and make them fight against their own homeland. According to Ukrainian media, thousands of men in the occupied regions were forced to enlist.\n\nFor relatives of captured Ukrainian servicemen, the news about the formation of the Chmelnytsky battalion comes as a nightmare. \"There has been talk about this for months, but now it turns out that they actually have to fight,\" says Angelina, a sister of a Ukrainian serviceman who has been living in Russian captivity for more than a year.\n\nThe deployment of Ukrainians in the Russian military puts the Ukrainian authorities in a quandary. For how to deal with these compatriots, who belong (whether forced or not) to the enemy forces?\n\nJournalist Aleksander Chrebet of the Kyiv Independent is following the issue closely. He spoke with several Ukrainians who fought with the Russians but have since been captured by the Ukrainians. They risk long prison terms for high treason. \"Proving that they fought under duress can sometimes be impossible. Often they were captured on the battlefield, in the midst of combat operations.\"\n\nTheir persecution often does not sufficiently take into account the difficult conditions they were in, the Ukrainian human rights organization Zmina previously noted. It argues that there must be convincing evidence that someone joined the Russian army of their own free will. According to the researchers, personal circumstances are not taken into account or not taken into account enough.\n\nIdeally, Ukraine would like citizens forced into Russian service to surrender themselves to the front. To this end, a special phone number has been launched. Via WhatsApp or Telegram, it can be indicated that someone wants to surrender to the Ukrainian side. A plan is then made as to how and where that can be done most safely. This could be an option for Ukrainian POWs.\n\nBy the way, there are actually Ukrainian citizens who want to serve in the Russian army. Journalist Chrebet spoke with two of them, who have since been sentenced to 10 and 15 years in prison. Both want to return to Russia and hope to be exchanged for Ukrainian POWs.\n\nSiberian battalion\n\nIncidentally, last week Ukraine also set up a battalion consisting exclusively of Russian citizens. The \"Siberian Battalion,\" according to Ukrainian military intelligence, consists of Russians who have traveled to Ukraine via a third country. They are said to be mainly ethnic minorities, who oppose Moscow. And an important detail: the battalion says it does not recruit prisoners of war.",

It could be that they originally intended to follow through, but Xi and his close associates either lost interest with BRI as a whole a few years later, and without that it can\u2019t move forward, or they promised more than they could realistically afford. </p>\n\n<p>The article mentions the Philippines seeking investment from Japan/the west, which highlights what a missed opportunity the Philippines was for China. The Philippines did not have to end up in the western camp. If China had focused less on the specific territorial waters being fought over, and more on the larger political and strategic picture, the Philippines could have been kept neutral, or possibly friendly, which would do much more to help in the event of war over Taiwan than the aforementioned reefs.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": ">[Hezbollah chief Nasrallah to break silence on Israel-Gaza war](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67304185)\n\n>Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the Lebanese Shia Islamist group Hezbollah, is expected to address his followers on Friday, his first public comments since the Israel-Hamas war broke out.\n\n>The speech is likely to indicate the group's next moves, as its fighters and the Israeli army are engaged in intense attacks on the Lebanon-Israel border.\n\n>This has raised fears the area could become another front in the conflict.\n\n>So far, however, the violence has largely been contained.\n\n>Since Hamas carried out the 7 October attacks on Israel, killing more than 1,400 people, Lebanon has been on edge, closely watching Hezbollah.\n\n>The group has intensified its attacks on Israel, which is retaliating.\n\n>But both sides have apparently taken steps to avoid a dangerous escalation, and most strikes have been limited to the border area.\n\n>This, however, could change.\n\n>Israel is pushing ahead with its ground invasion of Gaza, with the goal of eliminating Hamas, while the number of Palestinians killed in the territory has passed 9,000, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\n\n>Hamas, meanwhile, has repeatedly urged its allies to join the fight, and many wonder whether Hezbollah will answer those calls.\n\n>Hezbollah - which, like Hamas, is considered a terrorist organisation by the UK, the US and others - is the largest political and military force in Lebanon.

As if there are no civilian tractors, excavators, and trucks in Ukraine. As if it is cheaper to throw infantrymen with a shovel into an empty place and give the order to dig in, than to dig into the ground with equipment, make a reliable overlap, concrete dugouts, then mine, and make this railway embankment impregnable for small groups of infantry as a defensive line. But there are not even trenches there. And now the troops cannot hold it, because now they have to dig in there with one shovel in their hands and under fire, and heavy battles are being fought for this embankment, because it is a key border.  \n>  \n>Thus, after heavy losses near Avdiivka, the enemy stopped throwing military equipment into battle, the enemy captured the railway embankment exclusively by infantry forces with the support of artillery. If there were dug positions from our side such as the Russians are digging from their side - there would be no Russian breakthrough and no crisis near Avdiivka at all.  \n>  \n>Therefore, the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, who so often reports that he is holding a meeting of the Defense Staff, should look at these photos and finally realize that he is neglecting his duties and because of his responsibility and indifference to this important issue of defense, the execution of military operations is being disrupted tasks and our soldiers are dying, many people who could live if at least someone instead of political intrigues was engaged in defense planning. Instead of a photo shoot in Avdiivka, Mr. Zelensky should come and see the state of the defense organization.  \n>  \n>The military administrations, which are directly subordinate to the president, would have to build the frontiers together with construction equipment, civil organizations, and the delivery of construction materials. But they don't do it, because the president doesn't ask them for it.  \n>  \n>If you can't do it yourself, start learning at least from the Russians. And does not mislead society as if someone is responsible for the construction of defensive lines. No one answers.\u201d\n\nIf what Butusov says is true, it seems like complete negligence from Ukraine in recognizing the importance of fortified trenches. Russians captured the railway on the Krasnohorivka side for less than 2 weeks and are already constructing concrete reinforced trenches while Avdeevka has been under Ukrainian control for 9 years and is lacking even basic trenches in key defensive positions? Its hard to believe that the Ukrainian military can be this incompetent(assuming this was the result of incompetence and not intentional). I included the telegram link in case you want to check out the photos for yourself.\n\nAlso interesting that he is directing criticism towards Zelensky. We just had a time article about Zelensky that painted him in a less than flattering light and seemed to ruffle a lot of feathers. Butusov evidently believes that at least some of the blame of the current Ukrainian crisis around Avdeevka lies with Zelensky. This could all be circumstance, but it seems like Zelensky's magic is wearing off for at least some people. \n\nEdit: Butusov allegedly has past history with Zelensky, so his criticism of Zelensky may not be indicative of anything else.

Many usually put the serious reforms of the UAF to get better to around 2018-9. </p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s why I&#39;m often  critical of UAF 3-4 star general officers, nearly all of them were at least colonels when the 2014 war started, which means they were long serving &quot;successful&quot; career officers who excelled at getting promoted in probably the most corrupt and incompetent army in Europe. </p>\n\n<p>And many of them did little in the most active phase Donbas War in terms of field commands (like <a href=\"https://www.mil.gov.ua/en/ministry-of-defence-leader/general-valerii-zaluzhnyi.html\">Zaluzhny</a>), while others did pretty terribly (like <a href=\"https://uacrisis.org/uk/39934-debaltseve\">Syrsky</a>). They won&#39;t all be bad based on the lackluster UAF history, but there is nothing about their history to suggest they&#39;d be competent in this sort of war.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s just that the Russians are somehow worse...</p>\n</div>",

Again, they ignored every lesson from the last year or so. Due to heavy losses, like the Ukrainians, to keep the attacks going, and to try to achieve some success they switched to the same type of dismounted assault tactics that the Ukrainians were doing around Robotyne and Verbove.\n\nTo start things out, before the attacks, due to ever present Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition, and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) drone threat, parking armored fighting vehicles (AFV), aka tanks and IFV and APC close to the front line is asking to lose them. Hull down defilade does nothing to hide from drones, they need to either be hidden in a nearby treeline with camo netting or else parked far enough from the front lines that it's unlikely a drone will fly that far to catch them (also likely more intense EW threat the deeper the drones go behind the enemy lines). That means AFV used for an attack will need to assemble from their dispersed hiding places well behind the lines, to then start the approach march, and then must travel pretty far to get to the front lines to start breaching ops and then attack. Far means more time, which means more exposure.\n\nFor whatever reasons, neither side has the ability to reliably disable enemy ISTAR drones when they launch mechanized assaults, the mechanized attacking force might not always be spotted before they're anywhere close to the front lines, but it's likely. When they are caught they either start getting hit along the way or the defenders wait and then ambush them when the AFV attempt to breach the minefields or other obstacles, using mostly artillery to fix and FPV drones to get the kills. If the AFV get closer to the enemy objective, ATGM teams come into play too,  and maybe the occasional defending tank hits them. Meanwhile, because neither side has remotely enough mechanized engineering breaching vehicles, they're running over mines constantly. \n\nBecause nothing can be achieved without mass, mechanized attacks are typically performed at the company level, which when coupled with a bad plan that has no means of dealing with enemy defensive tactics, means the mechanized attacks likely fail. So they retreat, getting tagged by FPV drones and drone directed arty the whole way back too, and they're not safe again until they're well back from the front lines, either back into hide positions or else under their EW umbrella that limits enemy drone activity.  \n\nIn comparison, dismounted forces used for an attack are at the very front lines to start and can launch attacks from the most forward outpost positions in squad or platoon strength, large enough to accomplish their limited goals. Often, it's less than a kilometer between lines, sometimes well under, which means the attacking dismounted infantry/engineer force can potentially achieve tactical surprise when they reach the obstacles in between (usually just AP mines) or to conduct an assault, depending on what's in front of them (so much of the defensive planning by both sides seems to be focused on stopping mechanized attacks, not dismounted). \n\nMore so, if dismounted attacks succeed, they can immediately occupy enemy positions taken or dig in fresh ones, which means they survive not only any potential counterattack but the near guaranteed ISTAR driven drone and arty attacks that'll follow. \n\nSame even goes if the dismounted assault doesn't even fully take their objective, the exposed dismounts still might be able to advance far enough forward to dig into a new position that'll act as their next jump off position for the next attack. \n\nAttacking AFV can't do that. Even if they take their objective and overrun an enemy position, they can't hang around. They need to FULLY retreat or else the drones get them, either FPV kamikaze hits them or drone directed arty. \n\nThe problem with the dismounted tactics are that they're incredibly costly in dismounted infantry and engineer sappers, no real way to avoid heavy losses. It's very expensive with the use of fires necessary to support them, lots of tubes and lots of ammo. And progress is very very slow. At best they can achieve the kilometer a day, likely less. No real way to get more, sequential attacks theoretically can drive deeper but then they have no element of surprise. They can't attack in one location multiple times, each attack draws more support for the defenders, so the attackers must constantly switch where they are attacking along the broad front. \n\nIf the defenders try to stop these attacks, they basically have only arty and mortars, which can be neutralized with by an effective counterbattery plan by the attacker, and direct fire by the defenders in their fighting positions, who if they do shoot they give away their positions. So even if the attack fails, the defenders in the identified front line positions will then get plastered by enemy arty who spotted individual fighting positions and will work to destroy them before launching the next attack. \n\nBecause the attacker is constantly shifting attacks along a broad front they might have days of regular arty fire missions to destroy a position, and any one of those future fire missions might actually be prep fires for another attack. So when exactly are the defenders supposed to leave their dugouts to check? If they stay in their dugouts until the arty passes, and an attack is occurring, they might have seconds or minutes until enemy infantry are in their trenches.\n\nAnd because neither side authorized a maneuver defense, the defenders can't switch positions despite being plastered by arty. Maneuver defense can go in any direction, but the most common direction is backwards. Which means retreating. Which is the opposite of Hold At All Cost, which is the directive given to both armies while defending by their respective political and senior military leadership.\n\nWhich means defenders just have to sit and take it. And if they are chewed up, replacements are pushed forward to man the exact same positions recently obliterated by fires. If the defenders can't reinforce it in time, the defensive position is lost in the next attack. \n\nIf they are hurting bad and need to be relieved, then they are vulnerable during the relief in place (which each side are often trying to decipher with ISR and SIGINT), then the defensive position is lost in the next attack. \n\nBecause defensive tactics are positional, the defenders don't retreat to the next best terrain features, they retreat back to the next terrain feature regardless of what it is, or maybe dig into a position in the middle of a big ass open field because some colonel or general picked it as the new defensive position to tie in with the rest of the line, their focus being continuous lines on a map and not thinking about OCOKA.

Russian infantry have entrenched themselves behind the railway, accumulating for the expansion of their foothold and to attack the Avdiivka coke and chemical plant - a key complex of structures controlling approaches to Avdiivka. Capturing the plant would signify a gradual but irreversible collapse of the defense and the capture of the city. Suddenly, it turned out that during the war, no leader in Avdiivka built a rear defense line, and fortifications are needed now, but there are no prepared positions.\n\nRussian assaults continue south of Avdiivka, where they are expanding the breakthrough in the area of the sand quarry near the village of Opytne, which is the second direction of encirclement of Avdiivka. The threat here is also increasing.\n\nIn the combat actions directly in the city of Avdiivka, Ukrainian forces are successful. The 110th Mechanized Brigade skillfully repelled all Russian attacks, completely restored several positions captured by the enemy during the massed assaults from October 10 to 19, and even improved their positions on some fronts. There is currently no threat to the city from the enemy's west.\n\nWhy is Avdiivka a tactical trap for the Russians?\nFirstly, the 110th Mechanized Brigade demonstrates exceptional combat readiness and reliably holds the city, preventing the enemy from gaining a foothold in the urban area. The enemy is advancing north and south of the brigade's positions.\n\nSecondly, our forces have much more favorable tactical positions and effectively hold the flanks of the breakthrough. Russian forces are advancing north of Avdiivka through a narrow corridor in a lowland that is only 4 km wide. From this corridor, they are trying to cut off our supply routes to Avdiivka, which are 8 km wide. Most of the enemy's rotations and reserves suffer losses during deployment since Ukrainian forces effectively hold the flanks and control dominant heights with convenient firing sectors. Russian infantry sustains significant casualties, and it is much harder for the enemy to conduct an offensive and maintain positions compared to our defense.\n\nThirdly, if the defense is stabilized north of Avdiivka, even in positional defense, Russian forces will suffer losses far higher than ours. The situation near Avdiivka carries much greater risks for Russian forces than for us.\n\nFourthly, Russian forces do not have a significant numerical advantage; Ukrainians have a considerable number of personnel and equipment. However, to leverage all the advantages of our situation, it is necessary to stabilize the defense.",

The Treasury Department said Turken\u2019s network arranged payments and shipping details designed to bypass sanctions and move goods from Turkey to Russia.\n\n> A series of United Arab Emirates firms alleged to have shipped aviation equipment, machines for data reception and more also were sanctioned.

Cell service is spotty. Internet and power are out. Airstrikes have pulverized roads and leveled neighborhoods, slowing rescue work.\n\nDoctors scribble on notepads in overflowing morgues and hospital halls, struggling to account for bodies trapped under rubble and tossed in hastily dug mass graves. The chaos has added to the likelihood of errors.\n\nYet the Gaza-based Ministry of Health \u2014 an agency in the Hamas-controlled government \u2014 continues to tally casualty numbers. It released its first detailed report on the casualties Thursday, giving names, ID numbers, ages and gender for Palestinians it says have been killed. The total toll is 7,028 Palestinians, including 2,913 minors, according to the ministry.\n\nThe ministry is the only official source for Gaza casualties. Israel has sealed Gaza\u2019s borders, barring foreign journalists and humanitarian workers. The AP is among a small number of international news organizations with teams in Gaza. While those journalists cannot do a comprehensive count, they\u2019ve viewed large numbers of bodies at the sites of airstrikes, morgues and funerals.\n\nThe United Nations and other international institutions and experts, as well as Palestinian authorities in the West Bank \u2014 rivals of Hamas \u2014 say the Gaza ministry has long made a good-faith effort to account for the dead under the most difficult conditions.\n\n\u201cThe numbers may not be perfectly accurate on a minute-to-minute basis,\u201d said Michael Ryan, of the World Health Organization\u2019s Health Emergencies Program. \u201cBut they largely reflect the level of death and injury.\u201d\n\nIn previous wars, the ministry\u2019s counts have held up to U.N. scrutiny, independent investigations and even Israel\u2019s tallies.\n\nBut an outlier is the ministry\u2019s death toll from an explosion at al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City last week.\n\nThere were conflicting accusations of who was responsible, with Hamas officials blaming an Israeli airstrike and Israel saying it was caused by a an errant rocket launched by Palestinian militants. U.S. and French intelligence services also concluded it was likely caused by a misfired rocket. An AP analysis of video, photos and satellite imagery, as well as consultation with experts, showed the cause was likely a rocket launched from Palestinian territory that misfired and crashed. However, a definitive conclusion couldn\u2019t be reached.\n\nThere have also been conflicting accounts of the explosion\u2019s death toll. Within an hour, Gaza\u2019s ministry reported 500 Palestinians killed, then lowered that to 471 the next day. Israel says the ministry inflated the toll. American intelligence agencies estimate 100 to 300 people killed, but haven\u2019t said how they arrived at the numbers.\n\nThe confusion has called into question the ministry\u2019s credibility in the Hamas-ruled territory.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at how Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry has generated death tolls since the war started.\n\n(CONTINUED BELOW)",

It would be interesting to see a breakdown of exactly which types of injuries are responsible for the most deaths I guess.\n\n\nAaaah, Ok, I think that we\u2019re coming at this from two different angles. When I\u2019m talking about attribution, I\u2019m more talking about how and why a death occurred, and whether it might have been preventable, rather than whether to assign blame to Hamas or Israel. I assumed that this data was available in my first post, and I was confused about why you were saying that there would need to be more detail. From my point of view, a shell is a shell at the end of the day, and a collapsed building is a collapsed building.\n\n\nMy point about releasing the cause of death or cause for admission data was more about trying to separate out deaths and injuries not directly related to combat from those directly related to combat.

They enter this data into a computerized system shared with al-Qidra and colleagues. According to screenshots hospital directors sent to AP, the system looks like a color-coded spreadsheet divided into categories: name, ID number, date of hospital entry, type of injury, condition.\n\nNames aren\u2019t always available, al-Qidra said. He and colleagues face disruptions because of spotty connectivity but say they call to double-check the numbers.\n\nThe ministry collects data from other sources, too, including the Palestinian Red Crescent.\n\n\u201cEvery person entering our hospital is recorded,\u201d said Atef Alkahlout, director of Gaza\u2019s Indonesian Hospital. \u201cThat\u2019s a priority.\u201d\n\nThe ministry releases casualty updates every few hours, providing the number of dead and wounded with a breakdown for men, women and minors. The ministry generally doesn\u2019t provide names, ages or locations of those killed. That information comes from reporters on the ground or the Hamas-run government media office.\n\nBut Thursday, in response to U.S. doubts over its figures, the ministry released a 212-page report listing every Palestinian killed in the war so far, including their names, ID numbers, ages and gender. A copy of the report shared with the AP names 6,747 Palestinians and says an additional 281 bodies have not yet been identified. The list did not provide a breakdown by location.\n\nThe ministry never distinguishes between civilians and combatants. That becomes clearer after the dust settles, when the U.N. and rights groups investigate and militant groups offer a tally of members killed. The Israeli military also conducts post-war investigations.\n\nThe Health Ministry doesn\u2019t report how Palestinians were killed, whether from Israeli airstrikes and artillery barrages or other means, like errant Palestinian rocket fire. It describes all casualties as victims of \u201cIsraeli aggression.\u201d\n\nThat lack of transparency has drawn criticism.\n\n \u201cWhen the Hamas health agency comes out with the numbers, take it with a pinch of salt,\u201d Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, Israeli military spokesman, said in a briefing Thursday. But he repeatedly declined to offer any alternative number of Palestinian casualties.\n\nIsrael says more than 1,400 civilians and soldiers were killed and over 200 hostages seized when Hamas invaded Israel.

The ministry is a mix of recent Hamas hires and older civil servants affiliated with the secular nationalist Fatah party, officials say.\n\nThe Fatah-dominated authority that administers Palestinian cities in the Israeli-occupied West Bank has its own health ministry in Ramallah, which still provides medical equipment to Gaza, pays Health Ministry salaries and handles patient transfers from the blockaded enclave to Israeli hospitals.\n\nHealth Minister Mai al-Kaila in Ramallah oversees the parallel ministries, which receive the same data from hospitals. Her deputy is based in Gaza.\n\nThe Ramallah ministry said it trusts casualty figures from partners in Gaza, and it takes longer to publish figures because it tries to confirm numbers with its own Gaza staff.\n\nHamas tightly controls access to information and runs the government media office that offers details on Israeli airstrikes.

The International Committee of the Red Cross and Palestinian Red Crescent also use the numbers.\n\nIn the aftermath of war, the U.N. humanitarian office has published final death tolls based on its own research into medical records.\n\nIn all cases the U.N.'s counts have largely been consistent with the Gaza Health Ministry\u2019s, with small discrepancies.\n\n\u2014 2008 war: The ministry reported 1,440 Palestinians killed; the U.N. reported 1,385.\n\n\u2014 2014 war: The ministry reported 2,310 Palestinians killed; the U.N. reported 2,251.\n\n\u2014 2021 war: The ministry reported 260 Palestinians killed; the U.N. reported 256.\n\nWhile Israel and the Palestinians disagree over the numbers of militants versus civilians killed in past wars, Israel\u2019s accounts of Palestinian casualties have come close to the Gaza ministry\u2019s. For instance, Israel\u2019s Foreign Ministry said the 2014 war killed 2,125 Palestinians \u2014 just a bit lower than the ministry\u2019s toll.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel has killed \u201cthousands\u201d of militants in the current war, without offering evidence or precise numbers.\n\nInternational news agencies, including AP, as well as humanitarian workers and rights groups, have used the ministry\u2019s numbers when independent verification is impossible.\n\n\u201cThese figures are professionally done and have proven to be reliable,\u201d said Omar Shakir, Human Rights Watch\u2019s Israel and Palestine director, adding he remained \u201ccognizant of different blind spots and weaknesses\u201d such as the failure to distinguish between civilians and combatants.\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE HOSPITAL BLAST?\n\nLess than an hour after images of the explosion surfaced on social media, the ministry reported that 200 to 300 people had been killed at al-Ahli Hospital. A half-hour later, the ministry put that toll at a staggering 500. The next day, it revised the number down to 471, without releasing details.\n\nWestern intelligence agencies said they believed the toll was considerably lower.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden said he had \u201cno confidence\u201d in the accuracy of the ministry\u2019s reporting. However, the U.S. government\u2019s annual human rights assessments from the region frequently cite the Gaza ministry.\n\nGaza\u2019s Health Ministry stands by the 471 figure and includes it in the total death toll. When asked about conflicting accounts, authorities emphasize the difficulties of their work and vigorously deny any fabrication.\n\n\u201cWe had a uniquely hard time because the bodies were so dismembered, body parts were everywhere,\u201d Health Ministry official Mehdat Abbas said\n\n(END)\n\n\n> My opinion on this article follows from here:\n\n\nI want to start with an acknowledgement that no system is perfect, especially in a war zone, but I think that the way that the Ministry of Health calculates casualties is deliberately misleading and opaque. \n\n\n1. The ministry never distinguishes between civilians and combatants. This means that every death in Gaza is counted as a civilian casualty. \n\n\n2. The Health Ministry doesn\u2019t report how Palestinians were killed, whether from Israeli airstrikes and artillery barrages or other means, like errant Palestinian rocket fire. It describes all casualties as victims of \u201cIsraeli aggression.\u201d It seems that all deaths in Gaza in the defined period are included. \n\n\nAssuming that Gaza has a population of 2.4 million people, and a mortality rate before this intervention of 2.91/1000 per year, we can expect about 6984 deaths per year in Gaza, or about 19.13 per day. Over 27 days (07/10 to 02/11, inclusive) we would expect 516.62 deaths even during a very peaceful period, with no refugee movement or restrictions on the import of food, fuel, power, or water. \n\n\n3.
