Leverage is real, the same way it produced massive companies is the same way that a liability is created. You don't get to print money or demand that all debts are forgiven without essentially breaking your economy into a million pieces. \n\nIt is liquidity because you are running into a much harder time getting debt now in China, and so companies can no longer borrow essentially to survive their previous debt. The effect is the same. \n\nIt's not just a small crash. Let me paint a picture: \n\nChina slows because... something it really doesn't matter what causes the first strike. Chinese companies see dramatic drop in profits and suddenly interest rates and debt schedules aren't met. The slow economic growth means that china cannot provide subsidiaries to genuinely help companies. The result is the sudden shutdown of very large chunks of the overall economy via these companies collapsing. You will also see the absolute implosion of the Chinese real estate bubble at the same time, wiping out essentially most of the middle class's savings. \nYou will see china's largest companies go on life support. You will see institutions that have been zombies over the last decade finally begin to die. You will see all the middle class face simultaneously a total loss of their savings, and steep unemployment. I could go on, but I think I am painting a picture of how this is shattering. \n\nSo what about your solution of just print money? Just printing money or forgiving all debts means that the entirety of society rather than the individuals bares the cost through inflation, other costs etc. but it has the downside of essentially doing nothing to correct the overall problem. The overall problem is essentially the entire basis of the Chinese economy and political system. So you have two options \n1. Collapse the Chinese economy, let it dwindle while other big crisis take hits like demographics \n2. Save the economy by essentially hyperinflation, and face the same problem in a year. \n\nIn short, the best outcome is to let the crisis run its course, and china has refused this for the last 10 years on an individual level with corporations.

                                                            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>The thing that you&#39;re missing though is that china has been doing that already, that&#39;s why China doesn&#39;t do bankruptcy (hardly at all) and subsidiaries to a massive standard, but instead of slowly deleveraging, they instead just push the issue further. </p>\n\n<p>You&#39;re missing the point though. Leverage is real, the same way it produced massive companies is the same way that a liability is created. You don&#39;t get to print money or demand that all debts are forgiven without essentially breaking your economy into a million pieces. </p>\n\n<p>It is liquidity because you are running into a much harder time getting debt now in China, and so companies can no longer borrow essentially to survive their previous debt. The effect is the same. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s not just a small crash. Let me paint a picture: </p>\n\n<p>China slows because... something it really doesn&#39;t matter what causes the first strike. Chinese companies see dramatic drop in profits and suddenly interest rates and debt schedules aren&#39;t met. The slow economic growth means that china cannot provide subsidiaries to genuinely help companies. The result is the sudden shutdown of very large chunks of the overall economy via these companies collapsing. You will also see the absolute implosion of the Chinese real estate bubble at the same time, wiping out essentially most of the middle class&#39;s savings. \nYou will see china&#39;s largest companies go on life support. You will see institutions that have been zombies over the last decade finally begin to die. You will see all the middle class face simultaneously a total loss of their savings, and steep unemployment. I could go on, but I think I am painting a picture of how this is shattering. </p>\n\n<p>So what about your solution of just print money? Just printing money or forgiving all debts means that the entirety of society rather than the individuals bares the cost through inflation, other costs etc. but it has the downside of essentially doing nothing to correct the overall problem. The overall problem is essentially the entire basis of the Chinese economy and political system. So you have two options \n1. Collapse the Chinese economy, let it dwindle while other big crisis take hits like demographics \n2. Save the economy by essentially hyperinflation, and face the same problem in a year. </p>\n\n<p>In short, the best outcome is to let the crisis run its course, and china has refused this for the last 10 years on an individual level with corporations. That previous refusal has led this problem to heart attack levels. </p>\n\n<p>I work in the finance industry so I know you can&#39;t sweep bad debt under the rug. </p>\n\n<p>With all that said though, the issue is that in best case scenario that china manages to somehow make the crisis minimal, and hobbles it&#39;s way over to their demographic transition by shrinking their leverage positions over time and implementing reforms.

It will only go  downhill from here hence the double down on the energy collapse rhetoric.\n\nFood for thought\n\n* Russia appear to have lost offensive capabilities and have started to lose ground military in the South.\n* More Western supplies/trained Ukrainian soldiers reach the front lines. Russian has issues with mobilization of volunteers.\n* Ruzzia economy is about to feel the burn and faces economic stagnation for the next few decades (see the blomberg reports) unless sanctions are lifted and gradual 'return to normal' is observed. 22 years of economic development under Putin is threaten which appears not worth it after failure of Feb maximalists goals.\n* Gazprom halted the gas supply through NS1, requesting sanctions removal. Cat is out of the bag.\n* Full blown campaign to sparkle fear of 'cold winder' in underway. At the end of summer, lol.\n* Prorussian forces started protesting in Europe. So far very underwhelming.\n* **Recession is a killer of oil prices**. This is why Saudis have  recently decreased price of oil for USA. Russia would be hit especially hard West if recession eventuates. \n* EU to introduce price caps for oil&gas.\n* Incoming elections in US.

I'd be surprised if Ukraine doesn't still have tb-2's from the original batch. If attrition is high then you stop flying and wait for AD degradation or use in cases of extreme need (as we've seen) and so losses become low and you're going to keep units safe, not lose your literally last tb-2 at the time. If attrition is low, then you're not losing your last drone either. This is the same kind of logical fallacy that caused people to wrongly predict the Russian military in the east is going to collapse after they withdrew from Kiev,  or the linear regression models for Russian tank losses everyone adapts, reality is non linear.\n\n2. Unlike tanks, tb-2 wreckage is easy to pick up, and the UA has every interest of doing so. Russian progression has been slow, they weren't moving tens of km a day, to hinder the UA from picking up lost tb-2 over their territory. Lastly, not all air losses over your own territory are recoverable either, those that fall over rough terrain, wooded areas, lakes, rivers and yes sea, such as in the case of snake Island and oil rig strikes. Logically it's impossible that some tb-2 shot downs didn't have their wreckage fall over UA territory, in fact, given the profile of how they're used in Kherson, I'd expect most tb-2 losses to be of this kind during such operation (in contrast to how they've been used earlier in the conflict for strikes around Belgorod, where I'd expect almost all loses to be over Russian controlled territory).\n\n3. Somewhat true, depends on the type of force to get there first, if it falls near a village, you'll get photos, if it falls in a wooded area, it's most likely going to be picked up by specialized force for that purpose that isn't taking photos. \n\nIt's extremely unreasonable to expect for all losses to be video recorded, let alone their wreckage. what kind of % is not recorded is difficult to extrapolate though.",

As an amateur World War One historian, I've previously mused on this subreddit that the Russian offensive from April through to June was playing out in some ways like the German Spring Offensive of World War One: making some worrying gains on paper and inflicting heavy losses on the enemy, but also eroding some of the attackers' manpower and getting their best troops killed off.\n\nNow that the Ukrainians are on the offensive, I'm starting to see parallels with the Allied \"100 Days Offensive\" of the First World War - lots of offensives up and down the line, attacks behind enemy lines, heavy casualties on both sides, and no obvious culmination point where offensive operations have to cease. I think many of us were expecting the Kherson offensive, when it came, to be a short sharp shock and awe attack - throwing large amounts of resources into a small area of the line with the goal of capturing one specific city. But with the recent attacks at Kharkiv and in the Donbas, and the relatively steady pace of the offensive in Kherson, I'm wondering if the goal is to create a new *unrelenting* offensive up and down the line.\n\nThis would have many goals, most notably keeping the Russians continually on the backfoot. However, if Ukraine is confident in its logistics and supplies, then it might allow them to achieve a kind of \"offensive escape velocity\", a positive feedback loop where they maintain the initiative, pick their battles, and inflict steady casualties, gradually tipping the war more and more in their favour. This in turn could prevent Russia from regaining the initiative and concentrating new troops for an assault and allow the offensive to gradually sap their resolve and manpower.\n\nHere are some of the indicators that we would expect to see if Ukraine had this strategy in mind and were pursuing it successfully -\n\n* **Non-culmination.** There won't come a distinct day or week where the offensive culminates. Instead, the offensive will be maintained continually, but with increasing emphasis given to one theatre after another.\n* **Taking of prisoners.** One distinctive feature of the 100 Days Offensive was that the Allies began to capture increasing numbers of German prisoners. This in turn reflected plunging morale among German troops. If we see the same thing here, it would provide evidence that the war might be coming to a close.\n* **Undoing enemy progress.** One painful feature of the 100 Days Offensive for the Germans was that almost all of the gains of the Spring Offensive were undone in fairly rapid order. This in turn further depressed their morale. If Ukraine were to launch successful attacks on  Lysychansk and Sievierodonetsk, this could have a similar effect.\n* **Striking seemingly impregnable strongpoints.** Another key feature of the 100 Days Offensive was its successful breaching of the Hindenberg Line like the battle of St Quentin Canal. It's not clear what the equivalent would be in this war - perhaps some successful attacks on the northern tip of Crimea proper.\n\nI'm not saying this is likely per se, and it may be mere hopium, but it's a new hypothesis about Ukraine's broader strategy that's come to mind, one that I'll be updating as news comes in.",

Further, we have something more up-to-date: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/11/us/politics/russian-casualties-ukraine.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/11/us/politics/russian-casualties-ukraine.html</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>10k dead in around 40 days</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Third, still doesn&#39;t change the point on what any one intelligence agency is considering in its final assessment on what is or isn&#39;t included. So, if Burns was specifically referring just to official RF military forces, and say the NSA or Mi6 include all of the above, then we aren&#39;t talking about 10k dead in 40 days, but perhaps as little as an additional 2k if you believe the LPR/DPR counts.
