Back in 1926, he published his conceptual work \u201cNationalism\u201d, which preaches the extra-moral radicalism of hierarchical Nazism and a special, heated anti-Russian pathos, arguing that Russians supposedly do not even belong to the \u201creasonable person\u201d species.\n\n> The progenitor of Ukrainian neo-paganism was a certain Volodymyr Shayan . In the 30s. of the last century, he allegedly received a \"spiritual revelation.\" Then, appointing himself a \"sorcerer\", he put together the pagan sect \"Native Faith\". During the Great Patriotic War, he joined the Ukrainian Nazis from the OUN, and later fled to Germany, where he continued to spread his teachings. His sermons were a standard vinaigrette for neo-pagans from ancient Slavic gods, Aryans and rituals invented on the knee. All this was seasoned with terry Ukrainian Nazism, in the best traditions of which Russia was considered exclusively as an occupier.\n\n> Shayan's ideas appealed to the collaborationist rabble who emigrated to the West at the end of World War II. For example, two centers of neo-paganism in Ukrainian have settled in Canada. But what was sown by Shayan gave especially abundant shoots precisely with the collapse of the USSR. The flag was picked up by Lev Silenko, who took a sonorous pseudonym - Lev Tigrovich Orligora. During the war years, he worked for nationalists, and having fled to Canada, he wrote his creed in the form of a historiosophical tome \"Great Faith\", created the RUN-faith (\"native Ukrainian national faith\"), laying in its basis a kind of \"Ukrainian Empire\". It is not surprising that hothouse conditions have been created in the West for the source of this obscurantism, which, in fact, has nothing to do with paganism. By the beginning of the 70s. branches of RUN-faith existed in the USA, Canada, Great Britain and Australia. In the 80s. in these countries, not just communities of this sect appear, but even temples are being built.\n> \n> After 1991, branches of the organization began to appear in Ukraine.\n> \n> Its adherents regularly wrote letters to Presidents Kravchuk , Kuchma and Yushchenko demanding that Christian churches be closed and Orthodoxy abandoned. And the teachers of Lviv University went even further by developing the program of the course \"Religious Studies\", which included a deep study of RUN-faith.\n> \n> After 2014, this trend, together with other neo-pagan organizations, became the basis for the implementation of the \u201canti-Russia\u201d project in Ukraine.\n\n>> **From Maidan to Satan**\n\n> The exact number of sects in Ukraine is unknown, but the number is in the hundreds. Some of them were created, being sharpened in advance for a specific purpose and flock. Others simply existed as branches of wealthier patrons. Still others - and at all in the form of a kind of closed joint-stock company with a couple of hundred small-town adherents.\n> \n> Among them are the Association of Rodnovers of Ukraine, \"Rodobozhie\", \"White Hammer\", \"Perun's Army\", \"Mokosha\", \"White Hort\", \"Great Fire\", \"Grandchildren of Veles\", etc. This hodgepodge from Svarog, Dazhdbog , Veles and Perun are held together by tracing paper from the neo-pagan cults of the Third Reich, as well as terry nationalism, hiding behind the search for the \"true ancient faith.\"\n> \n> By the way, nationalist formations such as \"Azov\" * , \"Aidar\" * , \"Tornado\", \"Kraken\" and others openly use the runic trident and the Black Sun - symbols of the occult practices of the SS. Here is a wolfsangel crossed with a Ukrainian trident, and the figures of the founder of the American racist group The Order, David Lane. Ukrainian neo-Nazis are proud of the images of the Odal rune - the symbol of the fascists of the SS main department for race and settlements, and the Nazi emblem of the Totenkopf division, which in 1940 shot the captured British, and in 1943 destroyed indiscriminately the inhabitants of Kharkov. Next to the blasphemous images of Christ and the Virgin, portraits of Hitler and Bandera, as well as the symbol of the Satanists Baphomet, are impaled.\n\n> If we talk about the origins of occultism and sectarianism, then I note that the \"Church of Satan\", which has spread across Ukraine, is one of the officially registered religions in the United States.\n\n> Is it any wonder that in 2015 in Kyiv, a group of pagans broke and desecrated the worship cross, erected for the 1000th anniversary of the repose of the Holy Equal-to-the-Apostles Grand Duke Vladimir - the Baptist of Russia. And already this year, a Lviv actress with reduced social responsibility became the star of Ukrainian social networks, portraying a slightly shabby witch with a cemetery wreath, with calls to kill all Russians. Allegedly, \"the most ancient primordial Ukrainian god, dozing for centuries in the Dnieper hills\" calls for this. The Kyiv store with the bright name \"Witch's Cauldron\" from the beginning of a special military operation for a lot of money offers customers to perform the ritual of \"spoiling\" the Russians. Moreover, all this Satanism finds a lively response and support from the official Ukrainian authorities.\n\n> I believe that with the continuation of the special military operation, it becomes more and more urgent to carry out the de-Satanization of Ukraine, or, as the head of the Chechen Republic Ramzan Kadyrov aptly put it , its \u201ccomplete de-Satanization\u201d.\n\n-----------------------",

The Kyiv store with the bright name &quot;Witch&#39;s Cauldron&quot; from the beginning of a special military operation for a lot of money offers customers to perform the ritual of &quot;spoiling&quot; the Russians. Moreover, all this Satanism finds a lively response and support from the official Ukrainian authorities.</p>\n\n<p>I believe that with the continuation of the special military operation, it becomes more and more urgent to carry out the de-Satanization of Ukraine, or, as the head of the Chechen Republic Ramzan Kadyrov aptly put it , its \u201ccomplete de-Satanization\u201d.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n</div>",

Can anyone speak to their typical missions in peacetime?\n\n\nAlso interesting reading about equipment attrition.

Can you comment on this?*\n\n>\"There has not been an analogue of today's hostilities for 80 years. Therefore, I do not think that anyone has studied this war from textbooks.

And many of those who are the so-called \"personnel\" have not learned anything except how to click their heels, wear tsatski and write beautiful reports, although there are extremely worthy people, such as Surovikin, and not only him.

Yevgeny Viktorovich, you deny the existence of this conflict in your responses to the Nakanune and Washington Post publications. However, analysts agree that the conflict is based on the contradictions between you and the regular military. Can you comment on this?</em></p>\n\n<p>&quot;There has not been an analogue of today&#39;s hostilities for 80 years. Therefore, I do not think that anyone has studied this war from textbooks. Those fighters who act effectively today have gone through dozens of wars. And many of those who are the so-called &quot;personnel&quot; have not learned anything except how to click their heels, wear tsatski and write beautiful reports, although there are extremely worthy people, such as Surovikin, and not only him.

It's a compelling narrative and great for you generic national mythmaking.... but authoritarian states don't miraculously have no political considerations. They are in fact subject to mostly the same political considerations as any democracy.\n\n\nNationalism doesn't care about your political system. It will always serve the exact same purpose. And it works infinitely better if you have an 'external threat/ enemy'. How can you rally support if you have nothing to rally against? Both Biden and Xi are relying on the exact same nationalist rhetoric because it's easy politics. If biden had abandoned the 'china is trying to take over the world' rhetoric that DT instituted then he wouldn't have been elected and vast swathes of the population would have considered him some sort of traitor. Pandering to pre-existing narratives will always be easier than changing the narrative yourself. the same way he's also pandering to trump's fallacious protectionist arguments about foreigners stealing american jobs. It's far easier to blame everything on some evil/sinister outside force than accept that things aren't great due to long term national policy failures. This will never not be the case.\n\nSo i guess i disagree. They don't need a 'war'. They just need an enemy, whether real or fabricated.\n\nAnd i'll point out what i've pointed out before. In this fallacious war between democracy and authoritarianism.... the end result has always been for democracies to become more authoritarian under the guise of 'fighting authoritarianism'. Because when you're rallying against an enemy your rights cease to matter. It's both flawed in justification and self-defeating in practice.",

It&#39;s a compelling narrative and great for you generic national mythmaking.... but authoritarian states don&#39;t miraculously have no political considerations. They are in fact subject to mostly the same political considerations as any democracy.</p>\n\n<p>Nationalism doesn&#39;t care about your political system. It will always serve the exact same purpose. And it works infinitely better if you have an &#39;external threat/ enemy&#39;. How can you rally support if you have nothing to rally against? Both Biden and Xi are relying on the exact same nationalist rhetoric because it&#39;s easy politics. If biden had abandoned the &#39;china is trying to take over the world&#39; rhetoric that DT instituted then he wouldn&#39;t have been elected and vast swathes of the population would have considered him some sort of traitor. Pandering to pre-existing narratives will always be easier than changing the narrative yourself. the same way he&#39;s also pandering to trump&#39;s fallacious protectionist arguments about foreigners stealing american jobs. It&#39;s far easier to blame everything on some evil/sinister outside force than accept that things aren&#39;t great due to long term national policy failures. This will never not be the case.</p>\n\n<p>So i guess i disagree. They don&#39;t need a &#39;war&#39;. They just need an enemy, whether real or fabricated.</p>\n\n<p>And i&#39;ll point out what i&#39;ve pointed out before. In this fallacious war between democracy and authoritarianism.... the end result has always been for democracies to become more authoritarian under the guise of &#39;fighting authoritarianism&#39;. Because when you&#39;re rallying against an enemy your rights cease to matter. It&#39;s both flawed in justification and self-defeating in practice.</p>\n</div>",

It really lacked the geopolitical and military realities that this issue hinges on. \n\nSo one issue with this question is what is the scope of the preemptive strike and what is it targeting? Will it hit US bases in other countries? Specifically Japan. Will it be against Guam or US ships in and around China or will it go all the way to US mainland or Hawaii? If it is just against Guam then it is possible Japan does not join, and neither will NATO have any obligation due to the nature of article 5. \n\nGuam is the most obvious target, it is defended but probably not enough to stop a saturation attack of many long range ballistic missiles: [see this little article](https://fsi.stanford.edu/news/frontline-guam-strategic-deterrence-westernmost-us-territory#:~:text=Another%20reason%20behind%20Guam's%20strategic,intermediate%2Drange%20ballistic%20missile%20attack.).\n\nHitting Guam with a huge number of IRBMs (non-nuclear) could probably be done with little warning, I don't know the flight time for that range but it is probably minutes rather than hours. It would be a Pearl Harbor level of attack that would bring the US into war.

It really lacked the geopolitical and military realities that this issue hinges on. </p>\n\n<p>So one issue with this question is what is the scope of the preemptive strike and what is it targeting? Will it hit US bases in other countries? Specifically Japan. Will it be against Guam or US ships in and around China or will it go all the way to US mainland or Hawaii? If it is just against Guam then it is possible Japan does not join, and neither will NATO have any obligation due to the nature of article 5. </p>\n\n<p>Guam is the most obvious target, it is defended but probably not enough to stop a saturation attack of many long range ballistic missiles: <a href=\"https://fsi.stanford.edu/news/frontline-guam-strategic-deterrence-westernmost-us-territory#:%7E:text=Another%20reason%20behind%20Guam&#x27;s%20strategic,intermediate%2Drange%20ballistic%20missile%20attack.\">see this little article</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Hitting Guam with a huge number of IRBMs (non-nuclear) could probably be done with little warning, I don&#39;t know the flight time for that range but it is probably minutes rather than hours.

This applies to any weapon development project that needs computation (which is almost everything).  Computation of airflow, heat flow, mechanical stress inside a variable cycle jet engine.  Computation of electromagnetic wave propagation inside microwave integrated circuit that drives AESA radar.  Computation of airflow around hypersonic glider at high angle of attack.

The approval authority to employ cluster munitions that do not meet the standards prescribed by this policy for procuring new cluster munitions, however, rests with the Combatant Commanders.\n\n> The Department will only procure cluster munitions containing submunitions or submunition warheads that do not result in more than one percent unexploded ordnance across the range of intended operational environments, or that possess advanced features to minimize the risks posed by unexploded submunitions.\n\n> Cluster munitions that do not meet the standards prescribed by this policy for procuring new cluster munitions will be removed from active inventories and demilitarized **after their capabilities have been replaced** by sufficient quantities of munitions that meet the standards in this policy\n\nThe DoD policy seems very sensible -- keep the cluster munitions in storage until they're replaced by something better.

It'll always be a gamble by your logic.\n\nNo, it's not and this simplistic view shows a complete failure to grasp escalation and the nuances involved. The West has been opposing Putin for the last 8 months. It is working. Ukraine is winning the war and has utterly humiliated the Russian military. The West has provided exceptionally large amounts of unified support economically, militarily, and diplomatically. The risk of escalation has risen, but it has not risen dramatically, in large part because the West has been even-handed in its delivery of aid versus potential escalation risks.  \n\n\nYet, somehow, supporting Ukraine and ensuring its survival as a state is never enough. It's always one more weapon system, one more this, one more that, always offensive. And anybody who says, \"Well, wait a minute, we're playing a delicate game here, these choices need to be carefully made\" gets lambasted as wanting to be a slave to Putin. Because apparently it's SLAVE or GIVE UKRAINE CLUSTER MUNITIONS and there is no in between. It's a child's take on war. Utterly ridiculous. Somehow, I trust the people in the Pentagon to know what is best in terms of the equipment that is needed on the ground based off the extensive picture they are receiving, just like I trust the experts in the US government who are working non-stop on this to manage escalation risk as best they can.  \n\n\nAs for your bow down argument and the resultant consequences, it's piss poor. I agreed with people making this claim when it was a matter of Ukraine literally being annihilated as state. But now? Anybody who is watching this who thinks nukes allow them to pull this trick, much less pull this trick on a state under the nuclear umbrella of NATO, has got a fucking screw loose. Putin doesn't think he can get by with that, he's shit-scared of NATO. The West has been nothing but firm in its response to Putin's nuclear rhetoric. Do not equate not giving Ukraine everything it wants on any given day as some sort of kowtow, but rather a complicated decision made in extremely complicated circumstances.",

Very likely, they got high on their own supply, and really do see themselves as some sort of bastion against Western decadence and arrogance.\n\n(2) Russian claims don't have to pass the common sense test, because that quality is actually rare.

Values are but the political facade used to hide strategic actions.</p>\n\n<p>And for the record, the same thing DID happen with Japan in the 80s, they just caved in, their economy stagnated and due to their relations it never had the opportunity of escalating like this one has.</p>\n\n<p>It also doesn&#39;t help that if they do the same things that we have always done, BECAUSE we  subconsciously see them as sinister and malevolent we become outraged by it and apply some extreme double standards. Just look at thenumber of people that have always been terrified of them because they&#39;re &#39;communist&#39;</p>\n\n<p>Put simply this is about sentiment. A long held sentiment that isn&#39;t goign away. Reform is a vague and arbitrary concept and given where current sentiment no &#39;minor&#39; reform will ever be enough.</p>\n</div>",
