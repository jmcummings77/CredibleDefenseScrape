It also connects to the article I posted earlier with sourcing components being a limiting factor.  If you want to have enough drones and anti-drone devices to have proper training you need to be able to source all the components.  \n\n[Army SOF's new drone course teaches gamer and maker skills  | Defense One | April 2024](https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/04/army-sof-use-video-game-skills-launch-drones-strikes-and-more-new-course/395917/)\n\n*By graduation, the students will know how to build their own drones and teach foreign partners on tactics.*\n\n*When Army special operations soldier Josh arrived in Poland to train Ukrainian soldiers, his students were skeptical of his prowess in flying the high-speed racing drones they use to launch pinpoint strikes on Russian positions.*\n\n*They said his use of his thumbs rather than index and thumb to control the joysticks was wrong. So he challenged the Ukrainian soldiers to a friendly drone race to find out who was right.*\n\n*Josh won race after race.*\n\n*It came down to \u201ca lot of hours [training] in the simulator,\u201d he said, referring to his use of the drone racing video game DRL, which replicates the controls of first-person-view (FPV) racing drones. Josh is referred to by his first name due to Army Special Operations policy.*\n\n*He\u2019s now applying the exact lessons he learned while helping Ukraine to a new program that seeks to train Army special operations forces drone operators and prepare them to instruct partner forces on unmanned systems.*\n\n*The program, dubbed the Robotics and Unmanned Systems Integration Course (RUSIC), is a six-week course within the Army\u2019s John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School here.*\n\n*The first two weeks include learning Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) drone regulations and training on program-of-record drones, said Lt. Col. Steve Schuerman, who leads RUSIC and two other training units as the 2nd Special Warfare Training Group company commander.*\n\n*Week three includes lessons in flying while being jammed by enemy systems, and in using drones in coordination with the Android Team Awareness Kit, an Android-based mission planning tool.*\n\n*In week four, students learn to operate counter-drone systems, and learn what to do when such systems are unavailable\u2014such as planning routes with enough overhead cover to avoid being spotted.*\n\n*Week five has students building their own drones and learning to manage battery packs for different payloads, lessons necessary for learning how to advise partner forces. \u201cIt's to teach them the fundamentals so that whatever they [work on] with a partner, they understand how to troubleshoot it,\u201d Schuerman said.*\n\n*Then, in the final week, students run through an exercise that tests all the skills they\u2019ve learned.*\n\n*\u201cStudents go from never flying a drone to being able to intelligently execute a one-way FPV attack,\u201d said Schuerman.*\n\n*Students then return to their units, and some have already gone right into advising foreign soldiers about drone usage, he said. Without these skills, American soldiers risk looking out of touch with modern technology, said Josh, who helps lead the RUSIC program as the non-commissioned officer in charge.* \n\n*\u201cThey're going to come to you with something that looks like this [and say] \u2018I need you to fix this\u2019\u201d he said, gesturing to a table of home-made drones while presenting about RUSIC at the Army Special Operations Forces\u2019 yearly capabilities exercise. \u201cIf you\u2019ve never seen it before, you look dumb.\u201d*\n\n*A pilot version of the RUSIC course started in fiscal year 2023, with the first course held in October 2023. There\u2019s been one more course since, and RUSIC intends to run four courses per year, each for 24 students.*\n\n*Graduates are also certified as master trainers, a designation that allows them to train others, Schuerman said. That\u2019s particularly important because Army special operations as a whole lacks the master trainers that, per regulation, are the only ones who can train new drone operators. \u201cWithin the operating force, there\u2019s very few of these people,\u201d he said. Besides program-of-record aerial drones, students also learn to operate a variety of commercial drones, build their own FPV drones, and operate ground robots. Josh showed off one ground robot modified to carry an electronic warfare payload.*\n\n*Ground robots can have a harder time navigating terrain compared to airborne drones, but they are ideal for the tight confines of buildings or for placing other capabilities in remote locations\u2014like electronic warfare devices.*\n\n*The course does not include loitering munitions due to cost constraints, Schuerman said. \u201cI would say our biggest challenge, like everyone else, is resourcing,\u201d he said.*\n\n*Legal constraints are another factor, Josh said. For training exercises, his instructors use an approved contractor to buy the off-the-shelf components for the FPVs the students build. The U.S. has been leery of foreign built drones, like Chinese drone behemoth DJI, because of the risk of data exposure.*\n\n*In principle, though, Army units should be able to buy any components they want, as drone pieces\u2014such as flight controllers\u2014do not automatically send data back to their manufacturers, Josh said.*\n\n*\u201cPolicy hasn\u2019t caught up,\u201d he said.*\n\n*The master trainer rule is another stumbling block, he said. A soldier who trained with a master trainer for months on drones but did not receive the master trainer designation could not train anyone else on drones, he said.*\n\n*Instead, he has advocated for a system more similar to other types of training, where soldiers are allowed to more freely socialize new skills, like medical training.*\n\n*\u201cI would rather you just say, Hey, are you a Green Beret? I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re competent to train somebody on a piece of equipment,\u201d he said.*",

THEN, after it stops, you and your buddies follow your TL and SL to cover as far away as possible outside the impact area, trying to stay together as best as possible so the mission isn&#39;t blown, evacuating your casualties if you took any.

To help you understand some of the problems, I will play along with your scenario. This is not an exhaustive list, just some of the things that spring to mind for me. \n\nFirst is the size and cost of such a platform, using B2s for example as A2A platforms defending AWACS is tough when there are only 20 B2s and already far too many missions for them to fulfill. You can have a B2 performing CAP or you can have it littering the SCS with quick strike mines. \n\nNext is the idea of putting too many eggs in one basket. A B2 carrying say 50 AIM120s is carrying around 1/6 to 1/8 of the yearly Air Force AIM120 purchase. That one asset would be enough to arm 8-10 far more versatile platforms in heavy A2A load outs. Magazine depth isn\u2019t infinite and you need enough ordnance to go around, not sitting back flying CAPs with a large percentage of total available munitions. \n\nFinally one must look at the kinematics of the missiles themselves. In a perfect world, let\u2019s say the AIM120 has the same range as the attacking Chinese fighters\u2019 missile. The fighters are going to be moving much faster than the B2, giving their missiles a boost from launch. The fighters are also faster and more maneuverable, much better suited to defeating missiles at max ranges than the slow and ungainly B2. The enemy fighters could fire first and escape return fire while the B2 would be a sitting duck. IRL its even worse since missiles like the PL15 out range the AIM120. \n\nFor a more realistic version of a missile truck, look at something like the F15EX. It can carry 22 AIM120s while being a high speed, maneuverable launch platform. It is unlikely it would ever have such a combat load during a war with China due to the severe drag imposed but maybe 10-12 AIM120s or in the future AIM260s working with F35s further forward to pass off missile guidance to.",

That isn\u2019t unique to aircraft missile trucks, it\u2019s also a major flaw in the idea of an arsenal ship. Placing too many VLS cells on one ship makes it a tempting target and is difficult to equip. Even with current force posture, we have a hard time getting enough munitions. Look at yearly LRASM buys or SM3/6s. There is no reason to believe that changes in force posture would be a silver bullet to this institutional problem.

That isn\u2019t unique to aircraft missile trucks, it\u2019s also a major flaw in the idea of an arsenal ship. Placing too many VLS cells on one ship makes it a tempting target and is difficult to equip. Even with current force posture, we have a hard time getting enough munitions. Look at yearly LRASM buys or SM3/6s. There is no reason to believe that changes in force posture would be a silver bullet to this institutional problem.

It is orders of magnitude cheaper to build a bunker than a glide bomb and the bomber to launch them.

If troops can move around in trenches without being detected as easily, then glide bombs become next to useless, and to a lesser extent drones as well. Even though there are many of them, they aren't area saturation weapons, they still need to rely on knowing where to attack. Combining all of the above with even greater defense in depth, so that reconnaissance parties uncover fewer troop locations and they are basically just shooting in the dark.\n\n\nThis is all predicated on the fortification happening beforehand though. It seems like the lack of fortification behind the lines is one of those \"for want of a nail\" situations. I wonder if it is born out of an acute lack of money for construction equipment perhaps.",

There's not a single good thing I read about it from Ukrainian sources: incompetent command, poorly trained soldiers with high average age (it was referred to as the \"grandparents' brigade\" by an Ukrainian), in addition to the fact that in general the shortage of shells is still felt (while somewhat improving lately), and for brigades that don't have 155mm howitzers things are even worse. Let's also remember that the 115th Mechanized Brigade is the only mech brigade that doesn't have tanks - as now the 110th Mechanized Brigade (which is getting reconstituted in the rear, so far it had no tanks) has received a batch of T-64BVs - which makes things worse in case of need of counterattacks. \n\nThe 115th Mechanized Brigade also had huge responsibilities in May 2022 during the battle of Serevedonetsk. At that time it was a newly created brigade staffed by volunteers. Nevertheless, its servicemen did not fortify their area of responsibility (the forest near the Hotel Mir) and didn't dig in despite having had two weeks to do so, abandoning their positions when the fighting came to them. With the result that the Russians took the hotel, the city was surrounded on three sides and the neighboring units found themselves quite fucked. Criminal cases for desertion were initiated against dozens of its servicemen. \n\nKABs also played an important role, however. On April 18 alone, according to the observer Kovalenko, 44 of them fell on Ocheretyne! This greatly complicated the situation, and the Russians took advantage of this by converging numerous forces on a village that's very tactically important. And the situation may get worse in the coming days. Ruslan Mykula earlier reported that the Russians would already be in the northern part of Ocheretyne, and the situation is also deteriorating in Novobakhmutivka. \n\nAfter the Russians realized that they were having great difficulty advancing in a sustained manner while crossing the Durna (in Berdychi, Semenivka and Umanske), they have been concentrating on the ends of the sector, namely the Ocheretyne/Novokalynove area in the north and the Netailove area in the south, for the past two weeks. \n\nThe Russian unit that's advancing northwards inside Ocheretyne is the 433rd Motorized Regiment of the 27th Motorized Division of the 2nd CAA (i.e. the former 21st Motorized Brigade); the 30th Motorized Brigade of the 2nd CAA is fighting to its right, in the area of Hill 240. In recent days the 41st CAA has also been brought back into battle after a brief refitting. Its 35th Motorized Brigade has been committed between Ocheretyne and Novobakhmutivka, and its 74th Motorized Brigade is active in the direction of Novobakhmutivka from Berdychi. This suggests that at the moment this direction has become Russia's priority in the Avdiivka sector and they are concentrating numerous forces for this objective. On the Ukrainian side, in addition to the 115th Mechanized Brigade, there is the 47th Mechanized Brigade which is really doing everything it can from Ocheretyne to Berdychi, along with the smaller units attached to it. Elements of the 23rd Mechanized Brigade are in Novokalynove, where they are halting the advance inside the village by the 132nd Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps. In general, the situation in the northern flank of the sector is critical and there still aren't signs of stabilization yet.",

Ruslan Mykula earlier reported that the Russians would already be in the northern part of Ocheretyne, and the situation is also deteriorating in Novobakhmutivka. </p>\n\n<p>After the Russians realized that they were having great difficulty advancing in a sustained manner while crossing the Durna (in Berdychi, Semenivka and Umanske), they have been concentrating on the ends of the sector, namely the Ocheretyne/Novokalynove area in the north and the Netailove area in the south, for the past two weeks. </p>\n\n<p>The Russian unit that&#39;s advancing northwards inside Ocheretyne is the 433rd Motorized Regiment of the 27th Motorized Division of the 2nd CAA (i.e. the former 21st Motorized Brigade); the 30th Motorized Brigade of the 2nd CAA is fighting to its right, in the area of Hill 240. In recent days the 41st CAA has also been brought back into battle after a brief refitting. Its 35th Motorized Brigade has been committed between Ocheretyne and Novobakhmutivka, and its 74th Motorized Brigade is active in the direction of Novobakhmutivka from Berdychi. This suggests that at the moment this direction has become Russia&#39;s priority in the Avdiivka sector and they are concentrating numerous forces for this objective. On the Ukrainian side, in addition to the 115th Mechanized Brigade, there is the 47th Mechanized Brigade which is really doing everything it can from Ocheretyne to Berdychi, along with the smaller units attached to it. Elements of the 23rd Mechanized Brigade are in Novokalynove, where they are halting the advance inside the village by the 132nd Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps. In general, the situation in the northern flank of the sector is critical and there still aren&#39;t signs of stabilization yet.</p>\n</div>",

We certainly cannot demonize all its soldiers, let that be clear - I am sure most did their duty, after all, there are not a few MIA notices of soldiers from this brigade coming out in the recent days. But that doesn't diminish the internal problems in the 115th Brigade. I also forgot when in October 2022 their negligence resulted in the loss of Vodyane and Opytne in the southern flank of Avdiivka, a negative development that had to be stabilized by the 36th Marine Brigade (which is the reason why Kriegsforscher has a grudge against them, probably).\n\nI honestly did not have any information about the withdrawal of the 47th Mechanized Brigade into the strategic reserve. Rather, I think it was a battalion that was supposed to go into rotation that was brought back into battle. The area covered by the 47th Brigade, along with the smaller units attached to it (separate rifle and TDF battalions, possibly elements of the 31st Mech Brigade), is wide: from the southern part of Ocheretyne down to the beginning of Semenivka, where the responsibility of the 68th Jager Brigade begins. If it were withdrawn in its entirety it would take a fresh, large, capable, and well-equipped brigade to replace it. Which is, well, not something you find around the corner.

The EU alone has given $106 Billion to Ukraine so far, 36 billion of that was military.\n\nhttps://www.eeas.europa.eu/delegations/united-states-america/eu-assistance-ukraine-us-dollars_en\n\nThe biggest problem with question 1.) is:\n\n- Putin appears to be fully invested in pursuing the original war goals: conquest and subjugation of Ukraine and removal of its democratically elected government\n\n- He does not appear to have any doubts about russia's ability to win the war, otherwise we'd be seeing more focus on defense of conquered territory, and rebuilding of military stocks (instead of immediately spending it in attack waves)\n\n- Putin is a russian dictator, with a propaganda apparatus, an oppressive police force, and control over the population similar to Stalin. There is no actual opposition. If he wants to keep the war going, russians will be sent to war.\n\n- Putin knows he is in a war of attrition. He will be trying to maintain attack pressure against Ukraine in the hopes of an eventual collapse of the Ukrainian military.\n\n- He is confident he can continue mobilizing 25-30k of men per month for the next 3-4 years for the sole purpose of getting them killed at the front, and soaking up Ukrainian resources. Territorial gains are a bonus.\n\n- He is also confident that the retained oversized military industrial complex of the USSR can be brought into war production mode and will produce hardware needed for continuing the war indefinitely.\n \n- As a russian dictator, he knows that in historical context, killing 3-5% of the russian population in wars or political cleansing operations is not unprecedented. Most likely he does not expect pushback from the population. Pushback would not come in the form of protest videos, the most likely pushback would be in the form of actual revolts in the regions far away from Moscow. Anything the requires the movement of troops away from the Ukraine frontline can be considered pushback. \n\nSo, I believe question 1.) can be answered with:\n\n- No, 60 billion is absolutely not enough to end this war\n\n- There is no alternative to supporting Ukraine with more money, more weapons, and if necessary boots on the ground. If Putin manages to exit the the war victorious, then he will rebuild his weapons stockpile with new gear, continue mobilization until he has an oversized military, and threaten and/or invade NATO countries while he still can.

But, with these major pushes and small advances, Russia is looking to break up the construction of these defensive works before they get solidified. \n\nUkriane will probably have to abandon many of the forward unfinished positions and try to build more farther back on several fronts. \n\nAnti air ammunition is also low, plus high value AD gets pulled back first, leaving front-line troops open to Russian CAS, which people forget how devastating aircraft are with the focus this war on drones FAB-500/1500s just blow away whole defensive positions. \n\nUnless foreign aid changes and rapidly, Ukriane is looking at losing all of the claimed Russian oblast by the end of summer(2025)/early winter(2026), given that Russian gains keep accelerating. People will say, \"Look how long Adviika held on, or how long the push from Bakhmut took,\" but once those defensive positions are taken, Ukraine didn't prepare 2nd or 3rd lines(or is larely just now building them out). Gains will accelerate with the worst case being a return to manuever warfare. \n\nAs someone who dabbles in military/geopolitical contract work. I think it's safe to say Ukraine is going to be a rump state now, much like South Korea. The deciding factor is how much will they lose before the US gets aid flowing again, or Europe starts stepping up more(which will be difficult given they are just now reindustrializating their MIC). If Congress holds it up again, we may push into next year, at which point 2025 will look incredibly bleak for Ukraine.\n\nJust to return to stalemate, Ukraine needs a massive injection of these critical things largely in this order:\n\n1. Air defense missles from SAMs to Manpads. Fighter aircraft would also be huge, but unlikely due to training times.\n\n2. Artillery ammunition, more SPGs, and more long-range strike options like ATCAMs.\n\n3. AFVs, especially APCs and Tanks if they want any hope of retaking some lost territory. Tanks the least likely due to only really the US able to provide a meaningful number, and unwillingness to do so with current technology on active duty units/not wanting to lower US power in the short term.\n\n4. Massive investment of hardend MIC within Ukraine, by Ukraine to start building up its domestic output of vehicles/arms/ammunition/ect\n\nEven then, without some major change in the Russian political environment regarding the war, and a needed change in western support, I don't see how Ukraine holds on to its current territory in the eastern Oblasts, let alone any hope of a Ukrainian victory as Zelenskys wants with Crimea returned.

Here it is:\n\n[https://snyder.substack.com/p/how-does-the-russo-ukrainian-war](https://snyder.substack.com/p/how-does-the-russo-ukrainian-war)\n\nHere is my summary, but read the article because it's full of a lot of useful information from a professional historian. \n\n* We don't need to be concerned about Russia's saber rattling via nuclear weapons or be concerned about Russia losing the war. Superpowers lose wars all the time and it often results in reflection of themselves and changes within the superpower. There are LOTS of historical examples to pull from (Vietnam, Iraq, Russia-Afghanistan, etc). \n* Submitting to Russia's nuclear blackmailing is bad international policy and leads to a higher chance of nuclear war in the future. \n* The war ends by Russia losing. Because if Russia wins, the war continues further West. \n* Russia losing happens when the situation in Russia changes. And this is already happening. Because the war is no longer a far-out thing, it is a real thing happening to Russian people. As time goes on, the war impacts on Russian lives increase. \n* The war happening in Russia creates instability within Russia. \n* An instability in Russia means that leaders in Russia may have an incentive to move troops away from the Ukraine front and into Russia. Because that is how they preserve their own power. Aka, Putin quelling an uprising by moving troops to within Russia.\n* As that occurs, there becomes an incentive by military leaders to not be involved in Ukraine to preserve their own influence. \n* That shift results in Russia moving troops from the Ukraine front to Russia and the war ending - Ukraine quickly taking back territory lost since 2014. \n* This probably results in Putin losing significant power over the Russian people. Either a coup or civil war. \n\nTo me, this is pretty much how the war ends. Because without a political shift within Russia, the war cannot end. If the current political/military situation continues, and Ukraine gains back all of their territory, Russia will still be attacking Ukraine, and we end up with a Korean peninsula situation where the war continues for decades. \n\nWhat this also means is that Ukraine is following a perfect strategy. Hold ground, inflict death on Russians as best as they can, and increasingly bring the war to Russia via economic impacts, long range drone attacks, and by forcing Russia to fail at the front (Taking Avdiivka by expending thousands of troops and equipment is not a success). Putin has increasingly linked himself with the war in Ukraine, and as the war in Ukraine squeezes Russian people, they will look to alternatives to the war, and thus Putin. \n\nWhen I look over this, Ukraine absolutely has a theory of success in this war. It takes the following things:\n\n* Maintain and hold the front in a defensive posture - inflicting death on attacking Russians\n* Take the fight to Russia any way possible\n* Highlight Russian atrocities to this war\n* Beat Russia on the battlefield wherever possible\n* Continue the information war in Russia to break through the Russian propaganda\n* Maintain western support for weapons\n* Preserve the Ukrainian people as best as possible\n\nIt will just take time and pressure against Russia that will eventually result in a political shift within Russia. That political shift will probably happen suddenly and unpredictably (remember Prigozhin). And there is actually a lot of historical examples for such a situation.",

[You might find some information here enlightening.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_genocide_theory#Bloodlands_and_the_Holocaust_uniqueness_debate) He's not a researcher as much as he is a polemicist, and his angle is defence of Eastern-European far-right movements.\n\nAnd he fundamentally isn't a military expert, let alone an unbiased one.\n\n> What evidence do you have for a Crimean insurgency? Has there been a insurgency in territory gained by Ukraine? \n\nThe territory so far retaken by Ukraine was exactly that - retaken, within ~9 months of being lost. The populace there was the same as when the Ukrainian state had left, essentially.

Russia won't benefit from the same kind of global economic environment the US did in the post-WW2 period, where the war had destroy most of the world's industry while leaving US industry both intact and cutting-edge. In terms of exports, Russia would have to compete with multiple East Asian countries; the Chinese economy is already starved for demand both domestically and internationally, which makes for a very difficult export market against which to compete. Additionally, what does the total factor productivity of the current wartime industrialization look like? If Russia is just leaning on sheer size to outproduce Ukrainian production and Western donations, without sufficient investment and development in productivity increases, then this re-industrialized economy won't be able to complete globally with the US, China, Germany, SK, or Japan, all of which will be able to produce goods much more efficiently.\n\nThis leaves the domestic economy, but the source of demand from there isn't really certain, either. Russia is #67 in the world for car ownership per capital, which is middle-of-the-road (no pun intended). This means there's some room for demand growth in automobile ownership, but not nearly as much as, say, China in the 1990s and 2000s. I suppose there's light industry, but that would need to be heavily autarkic to survive competition from East Asia. I don't think Russia has much experience at all in light industry so I don't know where the knowledge and experience will come from to build up such an industry. I also don't know how adaptable the current reindustrialization is from wartime heavy industry to peacetime light industry. I would guess that it's limited. There's large scale capital projects, but I don't see that being enough of a demand source to absorb a post-war supply glut/overproduction. Furthermore, I don't think labor costs in Russia are as cheap as those of China in 2000s and 2010s, when the latter engaged in its capital project buying spree.\n\nAnd where are the paychecks to fuel this demand growth? Right now the only major source I see are the mobilization paychecks and industrial wages from wartime production. Both of these end when the war ends. Again, I don't see Russia being very successful in the export markets, so they can't jumpstart their own demand with export-oriented wage growth. Russia is also using up its debt capacity for the war effort, so that's less debt that could be used to backstop household consumption via stimulus, government spending, etc. Meanwhile, they will be dealing with the inflation from an overheated post-war economy, which will further chip away at household purchasing power, thus affecting domestic demand.",

        "body": "I've been thinking about this one for a while, but if you are not aware the US Air National Guard (ANG) is in a precarious position with aircraft given the shortage the USAF airframes with plans to keep some longer and buying older generation planes to pad shortfalls.  This has meant hand-me-downs originally gifted airframes to the ANG will not be received and those they receive will be significantly more worn in man hours.\n\nThe ANG does have a separate procurement process and funding so they have a bit more flexibility than the traditional difficult shit show it is for the active forces.  So the question is, what can the ANG do?\n\nThey could try to buy older airframes of US design like the F16 from foreign countries, however, they would likely need to be updated and they may have questionable maintenance schedules.  Add to the fact the war in Ukraine has been receiving more airworthy F-16s this would mean fewer options for reimportation.\n\nThe second possibility is to buy brand new versions of US fighters such as the F-16v 70/72, F-15EX, and lesser extent F/A-18s however while these are familiar aircraft they are fly off as expensive or more as the F-35As, and when looking at needing these aircraft for another 20-40 years their designs will end up a bit outdated.  Not great, but doable.\n\nThird, be in line to buy F-35A's, which has a lower fly-away cost than modern 4/4.5th gen aircraft, but higher operational costs.  It would future-proof in that almost every Western-aligned country will be operating them for the next 50 years so parts should never be an issue.  One benefit of any retirement from the USAF, F-35 pilots would be familiar with the aircraft and its sophisticated electronic, sensor, and command systems.  However, if you have new pilots joining ANG there is a bit more training required for pilots and ground crews for the F-35, this means operational costs and training are likely greater than the savings of the cheaper flyaway costs.\n\nFourth, developing a new aircraft specifically for the ANG.  Something the B21 did to stay on/ahead of schedule/budget has to do with using parts from other airframes, much like the F-117 prototypes.  This could mean the ANG going through a separate procurement process modifying a currently produced airframe.  This could look like an F-35 without stealth coatings or simplifying the electronics systems or something with older airframes that I can't really come up with TBH.\n\nLastly and what I think would be the best idea for purchasing and/or domestically producing the SAAB Gripen.  \n\n* Low Observable - The Gripen-E is close to being a low-observable aircraft (reportedly sub 1.5m sq) which means it can support stealth aircraft better.  \n* Range - It has a fantastic range which really matters for defending a country as large as the US and supporting a war in the Pacific where wargames show severe attrition to airframes (including refuelers).  \n* Full support of all NATO weapon systems (US/Europe).  \n* Upfront cost - It does currently cost as much as other mentioned aircraft, but could likely be reduced by ordering enough aircraft.\n* Landing / Takeoff - designed to be able to taken off / landed on short poorly maintained runways means if there is a war anywhere the ANG could provide support in or from locations other aircraft just can't operate from whether in the Pacific, ME, or Europe.\n* Operational cost - The most important factor I feel for the ANG is how much it costs to operate.  Far as I am aware it is or nearly the cheapest modern airframe to operate.  \n* Ground crew costs - it is designed to be operated on by I think 4 people with only 1 needing detailed training.  This means not only in the event of a major world war civilians could assist with maintenance and operations but ANG could save on employee costs/logistics further lowering operational costs.\n\nThe biggest hurdles are production numbers and the US MIC not likely happy with a US military branch with a foreign purchase.  The only way I could see this working is a partnership with Lockheed/NG/Boeing and Saab to mostly domestically produce the Gripen which would help with reaching higher production numbers and expanding parts production away from a country so near a neer peer adversary.\n\nThe only other option is the Japanese or Korean airframes being produced but I know less about where Japan is in their 5th/6th gen development or the capabilities of the Korean current design.",

This could look like an F-35 without stealth coatings or simplifying the electronics systems or something with older airframes that I can&#39;t really come up with TBH.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly and what I think would be the best idea for purchasing and/or domestically producing the SAAB Gripen.  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Low Observable - The Gripen-E is close to being a low-observable aircraft (reportedly sub 1.5m sq) which means it can support stealth aircraft better.<br/></li>\n<li>Range - It has a fantastic range which really matters for defending a country as large as the US and supporting a war in the Pacific where wargames show severe attrition to airframes (including refuelers).<br/></li>\n<li>Full support of all NATO weapon systems (US/Europe).<br/></li>\n<li>Upfront cost - It does currently cost as much as other mentioned aircraft, but could likely be reduced by ordering enough aircraft.</li>\n<li>Landing / Takeoff - designed to be able to taken off / landed on short poorly maintained runways means if there is a war anywhere the ANG could provide support in or from locations other aircraft just can&#39;t operate from whether in the Pacific, ME, or Europe.</li>\n<li>Operational cost - The most important factor I feel for the ANG is how much it costs to operate.  Far as I am aware it is or nearly the cheapest modern airframe to operate.<br/></li>\n<li>Ground crew costs - it is designed to be operated on by I think 4 people with only 1 needing detailed training.  This means not only in the event of a major world war civilians could assist with maintenance and operations but ANG could save on employee costs/logistics further lowering operational costs.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The biggest hurdles are production numbers and the US MIC not likely happy with a US military branch with a foreign purchase.  The only way I could see this working is a partnership with Lockheed/NG/Boeing and Saab to mostly domestically produce the Gripen which would help with reaching higher production numbers and expanding parts production away from a country so near a neer peer adversary.</p>\n\n<p>The only other option is the Japanese or Korean airframes being produced but I know less about where Japan is in their 5th/6th gen development or the capabilities of the Korean current design.</p>\n</div>",

It has to be one of the three, F-35 F-15EX or F-16. There cannot be any other answer because the ANG is a reserve force. It *cannot* procure its own aircraft.

Additionally, the majority of ANG pilots are retired active duty kept in the force to preserve capabilities in a critical, hard to replace skill. These guys need to fly in the ANG a plane they flew when on active duty. Because the whole purpose of the ANG is to give guys flight hours so they can stay qualified in case the active force needs to crash expand their fleet. Say in the event of war. Third it is vital the ANG do all these things as cheaply as possible because thats the whole point of a reserve. To maintain additional forces more cheaply during peacetime than a larger active force. Its fundamentally cost savings. The preference isn't to have a super capable, but expensive, ANG. Were there money to spend on this project, it would be the USAF's preference (and probably the correct preference) to instead use that to expand the active force. The fundamental justification, the justification the services and guards use in front of Congress, is that it puts more men in uniform than if you spent the same money on active duty personnel. The end result of all this thinking is the F-35 and other hand-me-down aircraft. But really the F-35. Why? Because the US is about to make thousands of new F-35 pilots and theyre going to be the people retained in the ANG after service. \n\nI know the sub is up on the Gripen, but it is not in fact the solution to all of life's little problems. Its unrealistic to expect the US to procure something which is the direct competitor of the platform theyre trying to export. Just as unrealistic to expect the ANG to chart its own independent course regarding personnel and equipment. The USAF would sooner see the whole Guard establishment destroyed then allow them that kind of independance, and the US Army would help.
