This means that they pushed back our forces closer to the eastern outskirts of Bakhmut. This advance is about 1.5km. Arestovych calls for people to not \u201close their heads\u201d over this advance. The tempo and the scale of this advance are such that they will not allow the Russians to take Bakhmut, Siversk or other towns. There will not be a repeat of Lysychansk and Severodonetsk.

No real changes on the rest of the front, same attempts at attacking in the same places.\n\nHIMARS o\u2019clock\n\nExplosions in Nova Kakhovka. The Ukrainians continue to destroy HQ\u2019s, storage depots and other military targets in the south on a daily basis. Explosions in Horlivka and Donetsk. HIMARS are working well and the UK has given an additional 3 M270. Right now it is a war of attrition and it is going according to plan. Only a long build up can produce the desired effects in such a conflict. According to Arestovych, the Russian offensive in the Donbass currently has at best 1/3 of the power the Russians had in Lysychansk/Severodonetsk.\n\n...\n\nArestovych has believed that this war has long ceased to hold an existential character for Ukraine and now holds a planned character. The enemy is being worn down on a planned basis, and weapon shipments are coming in on a planned basis, sanctions are being carried out on a planned basis and lastly the Russian army will be kicked out of Ukraine on a planned basis There is far less uncertainty than in April. The strategic outcome has long been decided. The world is now focused on discussing what to do with a defeated Russia.",

Lol\n\nCompared to every other UK country UK energy bills have gone up significantly more. \n\nWages have been stagnant for 15 years whilst costs for everything have increased.\n\nI believe it was 16 million working people  had essentially nothing in their bank accounts.  Then you add in \u00a34000 of extra energy bills for the average house....

Indian and U.S. officials have asked the bankrupt nation to rebuff China\u2019s request to dock*\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/08/11/chinese-ship-sri-lanka-hambantota/\n\nNEW DELHI \u2014 The Chinese navy ship is reportedly unarmed. It\u2019s probably cruising somewhere in the Indian Ocean. And no one is even sure where it will go.\n\nBut for the past week, a 730-foot-long Chinese satellite-tracking vessel has been the source of rising tensions and a symbol of the mounting geopolitical tug-of-war between India and the United States and China over Sri Lanka at a time when the economically devastated island nation is caught between major financial supporters.\n\nAre you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine.\nSince July, the Yuan Wang 5 has been sailing from China to Hambantota port on the southern tip of Sri Lanka after Sri Lankan officials approved a stop there for \u201creplenishment.\u201d But Indian and U.S. officials have strongly pressured the Sri Lanka government to revoke access to the port, infuriating their Chinese counterparts.\n\nCaught in the middle, Sri Lanka\u2019s Foreign Ministry said in a statement Monday that it formally requested that China postpone the visit while adding that it \u201cwished to reaffirm the enduring friendship and excellent relations between Sri Lanka and China.\u201d Sri Lankan media reported Thursday that the ship had reduced speed and turned around, only to make another U-turn at sea and continue toward the island.\n\nAs of Thursday \u2014 when the Yuan Wang 5 was originally scheduled to arrive \u2014 Sri Lankan officials were still locked in negotiations with the Chinese about whether and when to let the ship dock, said a senior official at the Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry with direct knowledge of the discussions. Indian, Chinese and American officials have all been intensely lobbying behind the scenes, said the Sri Lankan official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private talks between governments.\n\nWhile a Chinese navy ship arriving at Hambantota is not strategically significant, Indian and U.S. officials argue that it would be viewed as Sri Lanka giving special treatment to China, a major creditor, at a time when the embattled government in Colombo needs to renegotiate its debt with a host of international lenders and obtain a bailout from the International Monetary Fund. As Sri Lanka\u2019s economy entered free fall this year, India, which sees South Asia as its traditional sphere of influence and is seeking to reverse China\u2019s growing role there, extended the island $4 billion in loans to buy emergency fuel.\n\nAfter ousting leader, Sri Lanka still staggered by one-two economic punch\n\nThen there is the history of the port itself. China, which financed and built it for Sri Lanka in 2012, took control of the facility on a 99-year lease in 2017 after Sri Lanka struggled to repay its debts, spurring accusations from the Trump administration that Beijing engaged in predatory lending with its globe-spanning Belt and Road infrastructure program.\n\nThis week, China indirectly accused India of \u201cgross interference\u201d in its affairs and dismissed its complaints that sensors onboard the Yuan Wang 5 could be used to peer inside India.\n\n\u201cIt is unreasonable for a third party to put pressure on Sri Lanka on the grounds of so-called security concerns,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters in Beijing.\n\n\nWorkers in 2018 in Colombo, Sri Lanka, walk past hoardings developed by a Chinese company. (Atul Loke/Bloomberg News)\nThe dispute reflects the jockeying between the United States and its partners and China that is taking place across the world. Since taking office, President Biden has ramped up previous U.S. administrations\u2019 efforts to curtail Chinese expansion into the Indian and Pacific oceans and has rallied countries such as India and Australia to help in that effort. For its part, India has sought American help to counter China, a regional rival with which it has ongoing border disputes.\n\nAmerican analysts say if China were to base military vessels out of Hambantota \u2014 which it has not done so far \u2014 the People\u2019s Liberation Army would gain a foothold in a highly strategic location close to important shipping lanes and the Persian Gulf. But analysts also say it is awkward for the United States to openly call for denying China access to the port, given that Washington has historically espoused the principle of unrestricted navigation and often irritates China with its naval maneuvers.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Colombo declined to comment.\n\n\u201cU.S. ships make port calls throughout Southeast Asia and East Asia that China finds uncomfortable, and vice versa,\u201d said Joshua T. White, a nonresident fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former adviser on South Asia in President Barack Obama\u2019s National Security Council.\n\nIn recent years, White said, Washington and New Delhi have strengthened their military cooperation in the Indian Ocean with a view to countering China. On Sunday, a U.S. Navy cargo ship underwent repairs in a shipyard near Chennai, a southern Indian city near Sri Lanka. This marked the first time India allowed U.S. Navy vessels to dock for repairs, something the Pentagon has sought for years.\n\nAs the Yuan Wang 5 made its way across the Indian Ocean this week and speculation surrounding the port visit spiked, media in both India and China were awash in chest-thumping commentary.\n\nIn India, newspapers blared warnings about the vessel\u2019s surveillance capabilities after the Indian Foreign Ministry issued a stern statement about monitoring any activity that would threaten Indian national security. Cable channels flashed the hashtag \u201c#Chinesespyship\u201d during news programs.\n\n\u201cTake Sri Lanka, for example: Their debt trap has already pushed the country over the edge, but Beijing is not done yet. They\u2019re intent on creating more trouble for the island,\u201d Palki Sharma, anchor of the pro-government WION network, said in a prime-time monologue. \u201c... Whether it\u2019s humanitarian aid, whether it\u2019s IMF bailout talks, only India has stepped up to help Sri Lanka. China has largely played spoilsport.\u201d\n\nThe Chinese were similarly shrill, especially after Sri Lanka asked to postpone the port visit.\n\n\u201cIndia is bullying a bankrupt country,\u201d griped the host of a popular channel on Tencent News. \u201cJust because India gave $4 billion, they think they now call the shots. How does that amount compare to what China has given Sri Lanka over the years?\u201d\n\nRetired Adm. Arun Prakash, a former chief of the Indian navy, said temperatures needed to be lowered. A dispute between India and China benefited neither country \u2014 nor Sri Lanka, he said.\n\n\u201cWe need to respect Sri Lanka\u2019s autonomy, particularly at this point in time when they\u2019re on their knees,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sovereign country that can allow any ship it wants to come in.

                            "body": "B&R is a vague decentralised clusterfuck of a 'policy'. It's essentially and vague 'vision' announced by the CCP and then various regional and departmental bodies from around china work amongst themselves to try and 'realise' that vision in whatever way they think it might work.\n\nSo in that sense it's not some nefarious conspiracy. It's not even coherent a lot of the time. And as we've seen in china proper a big strategy has basically been 'well let's build some shit'. I guess in a sense you could interpret numerous B&R projects as china just paying itself to improve the infrastructure in third countries in the hope that it provides them with either a financial (improved trade etc) or political (it's been very good for diplomatic relations broadly) benefits. To that end the ability of the host country to actually pay them back isn't really that relevant.\n\nBut fundamentally they have engaged in voluntary, willing economic contracts. Generally on pretty generous terms too. Sri lanka is an abysmally run country (hence the current collapse)so it's no real surprise that they failed to fulfil the contract signed. For other countries they're more than happy to engage with someone that treats them like a partner rather than a charity case (especially relevant in the case of african countries) \n\n> A debt trap can have something to do with forcing, but it can be other things. Like taking advantage of weak corrupt governments.\n\nbut then we come back mostly to motive. Based on how B&R has played out in practice i don't think it can be easily summarised as a case of simple economic exploitation in this particular instance. Then again even if it was it just amounts to mainstream capitalism. which is sad, but it's depressingly widespread and far from some unique ccp-inspired policy.\n\nIf a friend signs up for 'payday loans' and then has their TV repossessed, i don't say 'damn you've been debt trapped'. I say 'you're an idiot'.

It&#39;s essentially and vague &#39;vision&#39; announced by the CCP and then various regional and departmental bodies from around china work amongst themselves to try and &#39;realise&#39; that vision in whatever way they think it might work.</p>\n\n<p>So in that sense it&#39;s not some nefarious conspiracy. It&#39;s not even coherent a lot of the time. And as we&#39;ve seen in china proper a big strategy has basically been &#39;well let&#39;s build some shit&#39;. I guess in a sense you could interpret numerous B&amp;R projects as china just paying itself to improve the infrastructure in third countries in the hope that it provides them with either a financial (improved trade etc) or political (it&#39;s been very good for diplomatic relations broadly) benefits. To that end the ability of the host country to actually pay them back isn&#39;t really that relevant.</p>\n\n<p>But fundamentally they have engaged in voluntary, willing economic contracts. Generally on pretty generous terms too. Sri lanka is an abysmally run country (hence the current collapse)so it&#39;s no real surprise that they failed to fulfil the contract signed. For other countries they&#39;re more than happy to engage with someone that treats them like a partner rather than a charity case (especially relevant in the case of african countries) </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>A debt trap can have something to do with forcing, but it can be other things. Like taking advantage of weak corrupt governments.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>but then we come back mostly to motive. Based on how B&amp;R has played out in practice i don&#39;t think it can be easily summarised as a case of simple economic exploitation in this particular instance. Then again even if it was it just amounts to mainstream capitalism. which is sad, but it&#39;s depressingly widespread and far from some unique ccp-inspired policy.</p>\n\n<p>If a friend signs up for &#39;payday loans&#39; and then has their TV repossessed, i don&#39;t say &#39;damn you&#39;ve been debt trapped&#39;. I say &#39;you&#39;re an idiot&#39;. The companies are to an extent predatory and exploitative, but we all recognise that it is the system itself that is the problem (regulations= good), and that our friend has to take responsibility for their own fuckup.</p>\n</div>",

Kissinger didn't say he \"no longer thinks the problem was Ukrainian alignment with the West.\" He said what's done is done, \"the die has been cast\":\n\n> Mr. Kissinger courted controversy earlier this year by suggesting that incautious policies on the part of the U.S. and NATO may have touched off the crisis in Ukraine. **He sees no choice but to take Vladimir Putin\u2019s stated security concerns seriously and believes that it was a mistake for NATO to signal to Ukraine that it might eventually join the alliance:** \u201cI thought that Poland\u2014all the traditional Western countries that have been part of Western history\u2014were logical members of NATO,\u201d he says.

Kissinger didn&#39;t say he &quot;no longer thinks the problem was Ukrainian alignment with the West.&quot; He said what&#39;s done is done, &quot;the die has been cast&quot;:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mr. Kissinger courted controversy earlier this year by suggesting that incautious policies on the part of the U.S. and NATO may have touched off the crisis in Ukraine. <strong>He sees no choice but to take Vladimir Putin\u2019s stated security concerns seriously and believes that it was a mistake for NATO to signal to Ukraine that it might eventually join the alliance:</strong> \u201cI thought that Poland\u2014all the traditional Western countries that have been part of Western history\u2014were logical members of NATO,\u201d he says. But Ukraine, in his view, is a collection of territories once appended to Russia, which Russians see as their own, even though \u201csome Ukrainians\u201d do not. <strong>Stability would be better served by its acting as a buffer between Russia and the West:</strong> \u201cI was in favor of the full independence of Ukraine, but I thought its best role was something like Finland.\u201d</p>\n\n<p><strong>He says, however, that the die has now been cast.</strong> After the way Russia has behaved in Ukraine, \u201cnow I consider, one way or the other, formally or not, Ukraine has to be treated in the aftermath of this as a member of NATO.\u201d Still, he foresees a settlement that preserves Russia\u2019s gains from its initial incursion in 2014, when it seized Crimea and portions of the Donbas region, though he does not have an answer to the question of how such a settlement would differ from the agreement that failed to stabilize the conflict 8 years ago.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This isn&#39;t the first time Kissinger has made a remark like this. 23 years ago, Kissinger was harshly critical of the Rambouillet text in the leadup to the NATO intervention in Kosovo, calling it &quot;a terrible diplomatic document that should never have been presented in that form.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>So surely Kissinger opposed the NATO intervention, right?

First of all, we haven't even confirmed what kind of drones are being transferred, but if it's the UCAVs like the Shahed 129 (as has been commonly suggested), these are Iranian systems that haven't been battle-tested in the kind of traditional war this has evolved into.  If they perform similar to analogous UCAVs, the impact per-unit is probably going to be rather sober.\n\nWhich leads into the biggest unknown - quantity.  It's unclear how many are made available, but I'd be shocked if more than 50 (this is a guesstimate, not a number based on known osint) will enter the theatre before the end of this year, simply because Iran doesn't have all that many 129s and 149s, and any deal with Russia for Russia to produce more will take time (on top of training time and time to integrate a foreign system into the familiar gear the Russian army is currently using, something Ukrainians have had to deal with throughout the war but Russians are relatively new to).\n\nIf the number is indeed closer to 50 (or somehow higher) it'd increase Russia's frontline strike power against Ukrainian defenses and vehicles, but its role compared to artillery would probably still be supplementary.\n\nIf the number given in the short term is much smaller than that assumption, it'd probably go the same way the Inohodets and Orion UCAVs did - a cool gadget for some videos set to battlefield 3's main theme and that's about it.",
