As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

That said I'm going to give my thoughts why there isn't a huge push for our kind of interest on other platforms. (Mods please remove if you feel it's to off topic) \n\nOurs is a fairly unique interest. Defense procurement isn't really a dinner table conversation. That leads to a smaller community overall, and on a decentralized (though still federated) platform like Lemmy, that community would be even smaller. I just think the reason there's not a hidden community on lemmy of a few tens of thousands of people who talk about defense all day is that, well there probably aren't tens of thousands of us on Lemmy. Someone has to take the first big step of standing up a community and moderating it, so that people who share our interest can start to congregate. Which leads to the other problem with our kind of community.\n\nIt's fairly 'easy' to moderate some subs. If you're a mod in an anime sub and someone posts world news topics, well that doesn't belong in your community and you remove it. However because defense has an effect on and is affected by political development, geopolitics, economic happenings etc. the job of a mod is harder because they should be reading/understanding and trying to contextualize the article or post someone submitted before removing it. This makes it hard for someone to moderate a new community like ours on another platform, as they need to spend a lot of time (unpaid) to do it right.\n\nAll that said, basically I think the reason you weren't taken seriously, is that you were, it's just that there aren't enough of our kind of people to make it seem that way, and unfortunately that's unlikely to change. And also unfortunately, ours is a community that is not likely to come up on another platform at least not unless that platform gets fairly large.",

However, 2 distinct seismic events in succession would be at least circumstantial evidence of a strike/sabotage, though by no means conclusive.</p>\n</div>",

I recall that the curved section which collapsed this week before the dam's total destruction was repeatedly and specifically hit by artillery and patched numerous times. However, Ukraine's hydro company that had run the dam before Russia took control of it, was [emphatic](https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/859893.html) that these strikes posed no risk to the dam itself, due to the dam's study design. \n\nUkrainian military intelligence had been [warning](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/21/zelenskiy-accuses-russia-plot-blow-up-nova-kakhovka-dam-ukraine) since at least October 2022 that Russian had planted explosives and made contingency plans to destroy the dam. And indeed, on November 11, 2022, Russia [did destroy](https://archive.ph/0IH90) a portion of the road and rail decks on the northern part of the dam, using explosives. This was part of their retreat from the right bank of the Dnipro and Kherson province, in an effort to make it difficult for Ukraine to pursue them. However, the spillway gates below the destroyed upper section remained largely [intact](https://www.hydroreview.com/dams-and-civil-structures/dam-safety/uk-government-issues-update-on-kakhovka-dam-in-ukraine/), and the dam stayed in much the same condition, for the following 6+ months without incident. The Russians even operated the sluice gates to release water, when they wanted to. They had been letting water build up in recent months, however. Make of that what you will.\n\nNow I am not a structural engineer, but based on what I know laid out above, and a lot of other background, it seems highly unlikely to me that a bit of already compromised road decking collapsing is a portent of a broader failure of the dam. And the people who are experts are generally of the opinion that an [internal explosion](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/06/world/europe/ukraine-kakhovka-dam-russia.html?smid=url-share) is the most likely cause of the dam's failure.",

Urals crude, the price of Russian oil, is at around $57 per barrel, which is about $15-$18 lower than the prices being paid by the West. That\u2019s one reason Russia\u2019s oil revenue is down by 27% from before the war even though its production is now higher. \n\n> Another thing Russia\u2019s opponents have done is to impose a price cap of $60 per barrel on Russian oil. This has intensified Russian reliance on India and China, because it means that if Russia wants to sell oil for more than $60, it can\u2019t sell to the G7.\n\nThe price cap is looking like shockingly effective policy, simultaneously reducing Russian revenues while keeping incentives for Russia to sell to China and India. This in turn drives down the overall price of oil, which leads to consequential point no. 2:\n\n> Meanwhile, that glut of Russian oil is making it hard for OPEC to maintain its own output quotas. Since war has effectively forced Russia to defect from OPEC+, other countries \u2014 notably in Africa \u2014 want to defect as well. Saudi Arabia is trying to corral them into making output cuts to keep prices high, but they\u2019re not listening.\n\n> In other words, the combination of the $60 price cap and the China-India duopoly effectively mean that the world has formed a buyer\u2019s cartel with regards to Russian oil \u2014 sort of an anti-OPEC. The G7 are doing it for moral reasons while China and India are simply taking advantage of the situation to get a discount, but it basically amounts to the same thing. \n\nThe article also opines on the impact exponential growth of EVs is having on oil demand. While massive in relative terms they are still small in absolute terms. But what\u2019s more important now is how it causes OPEC members to react. Saudi Arabia clearly wants to maintain its traditional role as the global political and economic thermostat, with rate cuts used to exercise influence. But other OPEC members may see the writing on the wall over the next 10 years and decide they want to sell at north of $70 a barrel while they still can. And the incentives to claim market share now while combustion engine vehicles are a dominant majority are high. \n\nThere was a lot of hay made about embarrassment to Biden in the lead up to the 2022 midterms when MBS rebuffed his overtures and moved to cut production. Prices are lower now than they were then despite that and other production cuts. And while the reasons were fundamentally related to the current Russian invasion of Ukraine, the G7 have definitely noticed how effective the price cap has been.",

There's no other figure in Ukrainian Government who has received a direct electoral mandate by the Ukrainian people, including people living on the territories currently occupied.

There's no clear direct successor, since the office of the president is the only one filled by a vote of the majority population. \n\nIn case of Zelensky's death the office of the president would fall onto the shoulders of one Mr. Ruslan Stefanchuk - a name you're probably unfamiliar with, even if you've been following the conflict for a while. His ascension owed to the fact that he happened to be current presiding officer of the Verkhovna Rada. He joined the parliament in 2019, having never held any public office before, but in contrast with zelensky, while also not having been a recognizable face in Ukrainian households at the time. He only got the position as a result of an internal party power struggle in 2021.\n\nOf course, the 2014 precedent would suggest a snap election - but under the current Ukrainian constitution, it's illegal to hold elections in areas under the martial law (entire country)! The constitution can of course be amended, but this would only give credence to the inevitable Russian narrative of another illegal imposition by the western Ukrainians over the people of South and the east. The election itself would be a logistical nightmare, with a large portion of the country occupied (unlike in 2014, large enough to decide the vote), millions of people internally displaced or living as refugees abroad - one prone to further manipulation and delegitimation by Russia. Because even in the most optimistic scenario, no one would be able to dispute the fact that the process would entail an inadvertent disenfranchisement of the population of the occupied territories - just like it happened in 2014 in parts of the Donbass - where it only strengthened the mistrust of the Ukrainian government by the locals. \n\nThe problem I see then arising is with the legitimacy of the imposition of necessary sacrifices, first by an unelected president by happenstance, but this would also apply to the possible future case of a president elected under chaotic circumstances - he \nI can't see the orders leading to deaths of thousands of his countrymen signed by them to be as uncontroversial as it is now. Especially when it'd come to their perception by the people living between 2015 and 2023 frontlines, who'd see their loved ones accidentally killed as a result of the actions of a man they never got a say about - perhaps in contrast with their local representative, who might have defected to Russian side, but at least nominally, remains accountable to them - more so than the president of ukraine.

He would not enjoy similar level of trust, making the case for transfers of potentially far-ranged weapons weaker.\n\nThese are only some of the problems I see in an unfortunate case of Zelensky's demise. One thing it would most certainly save, would be Zelensky's reputation and position in history.

There is no military operation that can be mounted under these conditions -- even if UAF somehow figured they might be able to sneak in some troops under the guise of evacuation, water levels aren't fixed yet, and mines and debris are floating downstream -- they'd have no way determine *where* to transport them in the first place, and no way to supply them. Whatever military objectives may be there have already been rendered useless by the floods.\n\nThere is absolutely no conceivable military reason for shelling that area.

The 47th brigade and other assault units have been armed with Western weapons, including Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, and relocated to a secret location closer to the front line. During a recent visit by Washington Post journalists, the soldiers were waiting for the order to charge ahead to retake a large swath of Ukrainian territory and tip the war back in Kyiv\u2019s favor.\n\n>The counteroffensive will be the biggest test yet of the U.S.-led strategy of giving the Ukrainians weapons and training to fight like an American army might \u2014 but on their own.\nUkrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov called it the \u201cnext level\u201d of security assistance, something he and other officials requested from their Western partners. The United Kingdom has been providing basic training to thousands of Ukrainian recruits since last summer. But more recently, whole Ukrainian units have been sent to Germany and other countries to learn \u201chow to operate simultaneously together, like interoperability among the different units,\u201d Reznikov said.\n\n>\u201cWe need company-level, platoon-level, battalion-level training courses with techniques, with their infantry fighting vehicles, with a commander who will understand how to conduct his forces, support artillery, support reconnaissance operations,\u201d Reznikov said. Critics of the West\u2019s new emphasis on training the Ukrainians in combined-arms warfare, in which tanks, artillery, combat vehicles and other weapons are layered to maximize the violence they inflict, have pointed out that Kyiv is still missing key elements to fully implement that attack, mainly modern fighter jets. Ukraine is expected to receive U.S.-made F-16s after Washington agreed not to stop allied nations from providing them, but they won\u2019t reach the battlefield in time for the counteroffensive.\n\n>One goal of the training is to teach Ukraine\u2019s soldiers how to go on offense. For years, the Ukrainian military focused mainly on defensive tactics \u2014 how to protect its territory from attack. Even soldiers who fought Russian proxies in eastern Ukraine for eight years before Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion had little experience with planned assaults.\n\n>The quick, sweeping counteroffensive last fall to liberate nearly all of Ukraine\u2019s northeast Kharkiv region in less than a week was the military\u2019s first planned large-scale offensive in the country\u2019s more than 30 years of independence.\n\n>The success in Kharkiv, and last year\u2019s successful defense of Kyiv, were credited in part to previous NATO training for Ukraine\u2019s military, which began after Russia invaded Crimea and fomented war in the eastern Donbas region in 2014. Many Ukrainian commanders, now in senior leadership, took part in such training.\n\n>At the training in Germany earlier this year, \u201cthe main tasks that were played there were offensive \u2014 only going on the offensive,\u201d said a 29-year-old company commander whom The Washington Post is identifying only by his call sign, Tovarish, out of security concerns.\n\n>\u201cWe were in constant contact with their sergeants, officers, soldiers, as they trained us,\u201d Tovarish said. \u201cWe had translators with us, so we could ask any questions. There was never a time when we asked a question, and they didn\u2019t respond. Everything was really at a high level. We saw this other level, and we need to get there.\u201d\n\n>The 47th brigade started as a battalion that Shalamaha and Valerii Markus, a famous veteran and author with more than 450,000 Instagram followers, were charged with creating. It eventually grew to a full-fledged brigade intended to break through enemy lines.\n\n>\u201cI realized that there was indeed an opportunity to create something \u2014 something interesting, something important, which could then grow into something much bigger,\u201d Markus said.\n\n>\u201cWhen I joined the army 12 years ago, I encountered a lot of things that disappointed me very much, that made me hate the army,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen I received this offer, I saw it as an opportunity to build a unit in which I would have liked to serve 12 years ago.\u201d\n\n>Though still unproven on the battlefield, the 47th brigade is armed almost entirely with Western weapons and, in a first, nearly every one of the unit\u2019s soldiers has undergone a weeks-long course with foreign instructors. The 47th\u2019s leadership is also especially young \u2014 all born after the fall of the Soviet Union. Alongside Shalamaha, who is 25, Lt. Col. Oleksandr Sak, the brigade\u2019s top commander, is 28. Markus, the chief master sergeant, is 29.\n\n>\u201cWe are the young generation,\u201d Shalamaha said. \u201cWe still have our whole lives ahead of us, and we are now fighting for this state which we want to see for ourselves, for our children, grandchildren, and so on.\u201d\n\n>But the biggest change? They didn\u2019t just accept anyone, interviewing every soldier who wanted to join the brigade. Commanders questioned each person\u2019s motivation and readiness. Every candidate had to pass a physical fitness test.\n\n>Alyona, a 27-year-old teacher who goes by the call sign Airy, was so angry after the atrocities committed last year by Russian soldiers in Bucha, her hometown, that she applied to join multiple assault brigades. Each time, she was turned away because she\u2019s a woman \u2014 told to go home and cook borscht, she said.\n\n>Then earlier this year, Alyona reached out to a commander in the 47th brigade. He asked if her mother knew she wanted to fight. She lied and said yes.\n\n>\u201cI told him why I\u2019m here, that it\u2019s not to take some photos to post on Instagram,\u201d she said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a joke.\u201d\n\n>As she and others in the brigade wait for the order to begin attacking Russian positions, they\u2019re trying to keep their training fresh. Sometimes a commander will scream that someone in their unit is injured \u2014 a drill for the soldiers to practice quickly grabbing their tourniquet and applying it to one of their comrades.\n\n>Most of their activity is saved for nighttime, when they practice with night-vision equipment. The cover of night helps ensure that any movements won\u2019t be spotted by Russian forces awaiting the counteroffensive.\n\u201cWe are ready,\u201d Shalamaha said. \u201cWe have the motivation of people, we have the equipment and the most valuable thing we have is the spirit to win.\u201d\n\n\nAnyone know much about KORA?",

Each time, she was turned away because she\u2019s a woman \u2014 told to go home and cook borscht, she said.</p>\n\n<p>Then earlier this year, Alyona reached out to a commander in the 47th brigade. He asked if her mother knew she wanted to fight. She lied and said yes.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI told him why I\u2019m here, that it\u2019s not to take some photos to post on Instagram,\u201d she said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a joke.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>As she and others in the brigade wait for the order to begin attacking Russian positions, they\u2019re trying to keep their training fresh. Sometimes a commander will scream that someone in their unit is injured \u2014 a drill for the soldiers to practice quickly grabbing their tourniquet and applying it to one of their comrades.</p>\n\n<p>Most of their activity is saved for nighttime, when they practice with night-vision equipment. The cover of night helps ensure that any movements won\u2019t be spotted by Russian forces awaiting the counteroffensive.\n\u201cWe are ready,\u201d Shalamaha said. \u201cWe have the motivation of people, we have the equipment and the most valuable thing we have is the spirit to win.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Anyone know much about KORA?</p>\n</div>",

While nobody\u2019s willing to stand up to the president over the invasion, absolute belief in his leadership has been shaken by it, four of the people said. \n\n>The most favorable prospect would be negotiations later in the year that would turn it into a \u201cfrozen\u201d conflict and allow Putin to proclaim a Pyrrhic victory to Russians by holding on to some seized Ukrainian territory, two of the people said.\n\n>\u201cThere is elite deadlock: they are afraid to become scapegoats for a meaningless war,\u201d said Kirill Rogov, a former Russian government advisor who left the country after the invasion and now heads Re:Russia, a Vienna-based think tank. \u201cIt is really surprising how widespread among the Russian elite became the idea of a chance that Putin won\u2019t win this war.\u201d\n\n>The growing despondency is likely to intensify a blame game over responsibility for the faltering invasion that\u2019s already stirred bitter public divisions between nationalist hardliners and Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry. With the Kremlin facing a Ukrainian counteroffensive that\u2019s backed by billions in weapons from the US and Europe, expectations are low among Russian officials for any significant advances on the battlefield after a winter in which Moscow\u2019s forces made little progress and incurred huge casualties. \n\n>The catastrophic breach of a giant dam in Ukraine on Tuesday that the government in Kyiv blamed on Russia further complicated the conflict as floodwater swept across parts of the conflict zone. Russia denied responsibility.\n\n>Attacks inside Russia are adding to a sense of insecurity, including the largest drone strikes last week targeting Moscow since the war began. Fighting has spread into the Belgorod region bordering Ukraine, challenging Putin\u2019s image as the guarantor of Russia\u2019s security. \n\n>Even some who support the invasion and want to intensify the fight against Ukraine have become deflated about Russia\u2019s prospects in a war that was supposed to conclude within days and is now in its 16th month. Nationalists led by Yevgeny Prigozhin, founder of the Wagner mercenary group, have raged against Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Russia\u2019s army chief Valery Gerasimov for military failings, as they press for a full-scale mobilization and martial law to avert a potentially catastrophic defeat. \n\n>\u201cThere have been too many big mistakes,\u201d said Sergei Markov, a political consultant with close Kremlin ties. \u201cThere were expectations a long time ago that Russia would take control of the majority of Ukraine but these expectations didn\u2019t materialize.\u201d\n\n>Putin and his top officials insist Russia will win, even as it\u2019s no longer very clear what would constitute victory after its army failed to seize Kyiv early in the war. There\u2019s no sign of any challenge to his leadership from within his circle.\n\n>Most in the elite are keeping their heads down and getting on with their work, convinced they can\u2019t influence events, according to four of the people with knowledge of the situation. Putin shows no indication of wanting to end the war, five of the people said.\n\n>State media explain away repeated reverses by pumping out the message that Russia is fighting a proxy war in Ukraine against the US and its North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies, though it was Putin who initiated the unprovoked invasion in February 2022.\n\n>The Kremlin has imposed the harshest repression in decades to punish even mild dissent with jail terms. Russia\u2019s middle class who\u2019d formed the bedrock of support for opposition to Putin\u2019s rule in major cities in the past decade have been cowed into silence or have fled the country as part of the biggest wave of emigration since the 1990s after the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse.\n\n>So far, polls show most ordinary Russians continue to back Putin, who\u2019s mixed Soviet-era nostalgia with Russia\u2019s imperial past to assert that he\u2019s defending the country\u2019s interests and reclaiming historical lands by annexing areas of eastern and southern Ukraine.\n\n>Still, concern may be ticking up again after spiking last fall when Putin announced a draft of 300,000 reservists. A May 19-21 survey of 1,500 Russians by the FOM polling company found 53% considered their family and friends were in an anxious mood, a jump of 11 percentage points since April and the highest in nearly four months.\n\n>Prigozhin toured Russian cities last week warning of a \u201cdifficult\u201d war that may last years as he argued for martial law and full mobilization. He said in an interview last month that Russia risked a revolution similar to the one in 1917 because of the divide between the Kremlin elite and ordinary Russians whose children \u201ccome back in zinc coffins\u201d from Ukraine.\n\n>The ruling United Russia party began an investigation after a senior State Duma lawmaker, Konstantin Zatulin, told a forum that the invasion had achieved none of its declared aims, Vedomosti reported Monday. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of this somehow,\u201d Zatulin said.\n\n>Konstantin Malofeev, a Russian Orthodox nationalist supporter of Putin, wants Russia to keep fighting because \u201cthe Ukrainian state should cease to exist.\u201d He rejects any talk of a cease-fire, though he said many within the ruling elite including a \u201chuge number\u201d of business people would support China\u2019s recent peace initiative that envisages a truce.\n\n>\u201cThey say they support the special military operation but in reality they\u2019re against it,\u201d said Malofeev, a multi-millionaire who\u2019s also sponsoring a volunteer force fighting in Ukraine. \u201cIn six months, we\u2019ll have clear superiority in ammunition and shell production and we\u2019ll be ready to go onto the attack.\u201d \n\n>To be sure, Russia still possesses enormous resources for the fight. Its troops are dug in on the front lines in eastern and southern Ukraine and Ukrainian air defenses have been kept busy as Russian missiles and drones have rained down on the country throughout the past month.\n\n>Ukraine has ruled out a resolution of the conflict that leaves Russia occupying any of its territory, as it begins to unleash the counteroffensive that\u2019s been months in preparation. \n\n>\u201cIt\u2019s time to take back what\u2019s ours,\u201d Ukrainian Commander-in-Chief Valeriy Zaluzhnyi said in a Telegram post May 27. \n\n>With no end to the fighting in sight, Russian officials and billionaire tycoons know they face potentially years of international isolation and deepening dependence on the Kremlin as Putin pushes businesses to back the war effort and bans those around him from leaving their posts. \n\n>They and their families have been hit with asset freezes and travel bans under US and European penalties that have also made Russia\u2019s economy one of the world\u2019s most sanctioned, upending decades of integration into global markets.\n\n>\u201cOfficials have adapted to the situation but no one sees any light at the end of the tunnel - they\u2019re pessimistic about the future,\u201d said Alexandra Prokopenko, a former Russian journalist and central bank advisor who\u2019s now a non-resident scholar at the Berlin-based Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. \u201cThe best they hope for is that Russia will lose without humiliation.\u201d",

But Putin is fucked.\n\nUkraine is not coming back to the negotiating table any time soon. They hate Russia so passionately that it would take a truly desperate hour for them to accept terms that give away any land. And currently the trend line looks positive for Ukraine, so they have no incentive to negotiate. But even if it was truly desperate, Russia has repeatedly shown that they see cease-fires as an opportunity to re-arm and try again. Everyone is done with that bullshit. So Russia simply lacks the leverage or the trust to negotiate any kind of favorable peace.\n\nSo if it\u2019s not a negotiated peace, it could be a frozen or simmering conflict, but that\u2019s no good for Russia. Sanctions aren\u2019t stopping a war in the short term, but in the long term they will strangle the Russian economy. The oil price cap is really hurting their export revenues, their natural gas exports have cratered, and without western financing and technology, their heavy industry will slowly wither. But the real ticking clock is Russian foreign currency reserves, which are plugging all the gaps, and are being eaten through very rapidly. They will run out in one or two years and when that happens, it\u2019s going to make the 1998 Russian default look like a walk in the park. Russia needs sanctions relief pronto and a frozen conflict doesn\u2019t accomplish that. \n\nOk, so negotiated peace is out and frozen conflict doesn\u2019t help him. What about the option of a pure military victory? Sorry Putin. The winter offensive proved that the Russian army is spent. They went all out for months and gained Jack squat. We have yet to see if Ukraine can win back territory, but Russia is done as an offensive force. They may mobilize again, but it doesn\u2019t matter, the training pipeline doesn\u2019t exist and the culture of the Russian military is badly broken. Morale is in the toilet. The Russian army is fubar.\n\nPutin\u2019s current strategy seems to be to wait out western support, but that\u2019s a pipe dream. The west isn\u2019t really hurting at all at the present level of military and economic support for Ukraine. And the support is still very popular. It may slow eventually, but it\u2019s already too late for the worm-eaten Russian military to make any use of that.\n\nPutin is fucked. Can\u2019t move on the battlefield. Can\u2019t hold on forever like this. Can\u2019t get good terms at the negotiating table. There are no good moves here.

They&#39;ve done all kinds of atrocities, as far away as Izyum and within walking distance of Kyiv. How do you actually scare these people into submission after you&#39;ve shown them what defeat and &quot;liberation&quot; look like? They&#39;ll keep fighting, and even if the war were to end tomorrow, even if there were actual territorial concessions to Russia, the local population wouldn&#39;t just roll over for their new masters.</p>\n</div>",

Make serious overtures for peace that offer Ukraine something they&#39;d want.</p>\n\n<p>I dunno. I&#39;m typing all the above and I just can&#39;t fathom anyone buying it. Maybe before Bucha, or Bakhmut, or the dam destruction, or the rain of missiles on power infrastructure in winter, or Mariupol, or... on and on. But Putin has so thoroughly poisoned the well that the West is 100% happy to send serious hardware en masse to Ukraine. He&#39;ll never get back to pre-2014 standing with the West, especially not pre-Georgia, and certainly not Bush era.</p>\n\n<p>Putin&#39;s only hope of keeping its current conquered territory is to placate the West. I don&#39;t think he can do it.</p>\n</div>",

So they'll likely be shot down before they get into range. Now they could pinepoint the location of the S-400 systems and shoot cruise missiles at them. BUT, they are expensive and tomahawks are unlikely to hit the radar systems as they are likely to be shot before they hit the S-400. \n\nThey can try to use terrain and fly low to \"pop up\" and then launch their missiles at the S-400 system. That could work, but it's very risky and the S-400s would likely still get shots off at the F-16/18s. \n\nEven if they get the F-16/18s get their missiles out, it's still not guaranteed that they'll knock out the S-400 system. They can usually only target the radar system, which is independent of the command module and the missile trucks. All of which are mobile. All of which Russia has hundreds of systems. So even if you knock out one system, they'll have to come back and knock it out again and again until Russia depletes their crews or missile systems. \n\nHonestly, the only way to knock out an S-400 system is to use stealth (F-22/35) to get close enough to launch the Harm-88 to knock out their radar. Once the system is blind, they can follow up with JDAMs/laser bombs and destroy the rest of the trucks before they move. Which is a highly choreographed and very dangerous mission. Because S-400s can probably use multiple radars or infrared trackers or optical targeting systems and can shoot heat-seeking missiles. So even for NATO to knock out S-400 systems, they'll probably take multiple fighter jet losses on each mission. \n\nIf I were Ukraine, I'd swarm the S-400 systems with drones (30-50), JAM the S-400 radar system, shoot HARM-88 missiles from behind the drones using the \"pop up\" method, and then follow up with TB-2s to mop up.

While not unexpected given the chaos and disarray of the initial phase of the war, it's also a missed opportunity. \n\nKherson was a logistic blockade working. It was a strategical success, but tactically and operationally the Ukrainians didn't exactly cover themselves with glory. They were mostly stopped by the Russian defenses. The effort to cut the Russian forces in two via the offensive on David Bryd ran into a stone wall. The clean Russian withdrawal is possibly a significant strategic mistake on the part of the Ukrainians. The Russians were able to thin their forces at the front to bare bones, evacuate virtually all heavy equipment and then withdraw in good order before the Ukrainians (and likely the US) realized it was happening. Or worse, the Ukrainian didn't have the operational organization and reserves to respond. \n\nThis demonstrates a lack of initiative, difficulty to quickly react to developments, lackings in operational planning and control. \n\nLastly, the Kharkiev offensive. It was quite impressive. Great intelligence, good operational maneuver and exploitation of success. Seems like the Ukrainians didn't expect such a rapid success but adapted relatively well. Still when facing strong Russian opposition they performed just adequately.

                    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I agree with your broad point, but Kiev was not an offensive, in fact the Russians were allowed to withdraw in good order for the most part except on the Cherniev axis iirc. While not unexpected given the chaos and disarray of the initial phase of the war, it&#39;s also a missed opportunity. </p>\n\n<p>Kherson was a logistic blockade working. It was a strategical success, but tactically and operationally the Ukrainians didn&#39;t exactly cover themselves with glory. They were mostly stopped by the Russian defenses. The effort to cut the Russian forces in two via the offensive on David Bryd ran into a stone wall. The clean Russian withdrawal is possibly a significant strategic mistake on the part of the Ukrainians. The Russians were able to thin their forces at the front to bare bones, evacuate virtually all heavy equipment and then withdraw in good order before the Ukrainians (and likely the US) realized it was happening. Or worse, the Ukrainian didn&#39;t have the operational organization and reserves to respond. </p>\n\n<p>This demonstrates a lack of initiative, difficulty to quickly react to developments, lackings in operational planning and control. </p>\n\n<p>Lastly, the Kharkiev offensive. It was quite impressive. Great intelligence, good operational maneuver and exploitation of success. Seems like the Ukrainians didn&#39;t expect such a rapid success but adapted relatively well. Still when facing strong Russian opposition they performed just adequately. The Russians were still able to withdraw in relatively good order from Lyman for instance.</p>\n\n<p>I do agree that I expect the Ukrainians have significantly improved both from the earlier experience in Kherson and Kharkiev, as well as NATO training. But the Russians have improved as well.</p>\n</div>",
