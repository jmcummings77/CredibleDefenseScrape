As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster. Don't abuse it though! If something is not obviously against the rules but you still feel that it should be reviewed, leave a short but descriptive comment while filing the report.",

The group formed in May 2022 around a core of drone hobbyists with deep experience building FPV drones. They designed, built and tested prototypes. The most successful of these, with four bright red motors, was quickly put into production with the name Pegasus.\n\n>\u201cWe decided to make a product, which can help our army, something cheap and expendable so we could make a lot of them,\u201d says the spokesman. \u201cWe started this project in cooperation with two highly motivated senior officers of SSU CSO Alpha.\u201d\n\n>Alpha Group is an elite Ukrainian Special Forces unit, originally tasked with counter-terrorism but now fighting on the frontline.\n\n>While drones made by military manufacturers can be seriously expensive \u2014 the U.S. Switchblade loitering munition is priced at about $60,000 \u2014 Escadrone made full use of cheap hobby components for Pegasus. According to the spokesman, the basic Pegasus currently costs just $341, while a bigger, more powerful version comes in at $462. Both can be assembled with nothing more complicated than a soldering iron.\n\n>Escadrone carried out their first attack in September 2022, destroying a Russian tank near Davydiv Brid.\n\n>Combat use quickly revealed ways to improve the design and the team upgraded Pegasus' motors, the radio antennas and the control electronics, without changing the basic design.\n\n>But the spokesman emphasizes that the hardware is not the most important part. While consumer drones like the Mavic can be flown out of the box by novices with no training, using an FPV drone effectively requires considerable skill.\n\n>\u201cFlying an FPV drone is not so hard. But if you want to use it like a weapon, you have train for a month,\" says the spokesman. \"Because it's very difficult to hit a moving target at high speed.\u201d\n\n>(One of the reasons Switchblade 300 is more expensive is that it can lock on to moving targets and track them automatically. The same technology may reach FPV kamikazes soon thanks to new AI chips for drones, but at present it is down to operator skill).\n\n>Escadrone carry out training themselves, and say some of the best FPV pilots in Ukraine fly their machines. Videos on social media show their skill at hitting pinpoint targets.\n\n>\u201cWe have seen Pegasus operators fly though windows, garage doors and tank hatches, and even hit the backs of Russian soldiers,\u201d says the spokesman.\n\n>The basic Pegasus carries a one-kilo/2.2-pound warhead, effective against personnel and light armor. But Escadrone has bigger weapons to take out heavy tanks, carried by the larger version, which can carry a 2-kilo/five pound PTAB 2.5 anti-tank bomb. This is a fraction of the size of other anti-tank weapons like Javelin, but highly effective against a tank\u2019s weak spots.\n\n>[...]\n\n>The important thing is building enough drones to make a difference. Escadrone has already fielded thousands, and the spokesman says they are now making a thousand a month. There are other non-profits turning out large number of FPV drones too, such as Vyriy Drone with their kamikaze Molfar. Escadrone shares their designs and knowledge with various other groups.\n\n>Escadrone is working on a range of new models which are likely to upgrade all aspects. Details, are unsurprisingly, secret. Things are evolving fast. For example, the Russians are fielding electronic jamming systems to interfere with communications, and groups like Escadrone are changing their designs to counter the countermeasures.\n\n>In less than a year, FPV attack drones have gone from an obscure, improvised weapon assembled by enthusiasts to a sophisticated, mass-produced product operated by large numbers of well-trained crews. It is impossible to guess where they will be in a year or two or what impact they will have in future wars.\n\n>However, Escadrone has little interest in becoming a major drone producer or taking their products to the international arms market. Once this conflict is over, they will leave weapons to the military.\n\n>\u201cAfter the war, we plan to return to normal civilian life,\u201d says the spokesman. \u201dNo more kamikaze drones.\u201d",

The exercise sees thousands of troops deploy from the U.S. to Europe, an echo of the REFORGER wargames that prepped NATO forces to defeat a Soviet invasion of Western Germany.\n\n>The U.S. effort to help Ukraine started out relatively small. In December 2021, the U.S. authorized $200 million in lethal aid to Ukraine amid fears Russia would invade. \n\n>A lightly staffed unit called the Doctrine Education Advisory Group, or DEAG, was tapped to help inventory the equipment when it reached Ukraine. The group more typically worked on helping Ukraine revamp its military education courses, but threw itself into the task.\n\n>\u201cMy guys were pulling equipment until we actually had to leave,\u201d U.S. Army Col. Andrew Clark, commander of the unit that oversees DEAG, told Defense One. \n\n>Since then, the flow of weapons to Ukraine has increased exponentially. As of May 21, the U.S. has shipped or promised to ship $38 billion worth of equipment and weapons to Ukraine, much of it from U.S. stockpiles. \n\n>Among the many bulky packages delivered or coming to Ukraine are two million 155mm artillery shells, each weighing 95 pounds; and 2,000 Humvee trucks, weighing around three-and-a-half tons. A total of 749 infantry fighting vehicles and armored personnel carriers have also been promised, with 31 Abrams tanks arriving in Ukraine in the fall. \n\n>This flow of arms has helped replenish Ukraine\u2019s munitions stockpiles and bestowed new abilities to strike deep into Russian-occupied territory. \n\n>The U.S. military also increased its presence in Europe by 20,000, bringing the total of U.S. service members on the continent to 100,000.\n\n>The Army has occasionally run into speed bumps as it ramps up to once again face a Russia eager to reclaim at least some of the boundaries of the old Soviet Union. \n\n>Amid the rumbles of a possible Russian invasion, Army logisticians\u2019 raced round the clock in early 2022 to outfit an entire Army brigade combat team arriving from the United States. They achieved their goal twice as fast as expected, earning plaudits from the Army chief of staff. \n\n>A Defense Department Inspector General investigation likewise noted the speed, but found that around 10 percent of equipment issued from pre-positioned stockpiles was not up to snuff. \n\n>Among the problems was an inability to run vehicles on exercise tracks, as called for in their maintenance instructions, as these exercise tracks had never been built. \n\n>\u201cWhen the Cold War ended, the idea that you would have to rapidly pull equipment out of storage in Europe just didn\u2019t seem very likely,\u201d Mark F.

Capable vehicles with serious teeth, but realistically speaking the per unit cost breakdown is very expensive.   \n\n\nYou can choose to go into a conflict with 50 additional AIFVs, considering a peer to peer conflict is likely to have a first week burn rate upwards of 50 AIFVs right off the bat.   \n\n\nOr you can choose to go into that conflict with 82,500 $20K Shahed drones ready to fling into enemy defences, infrastructure, fuel depots, munitions depots, communication and control hubs, etc.   \nNow I'd sooner purchase a literal shitload of Shaheds as opposed to a relatively meagre number of AIFVs. Which is I'm sure the same calculus that many limited budget armed forces around the world are running right now.   \n\n\nWorse yet, with our current doctrine and equipment we're shooting down each of these $20K drones with near $500K-$1M per unit missiles? Make that make sense. It's fine if the conflict is only set to last 2-3 days, but any longer than that and our stockpiles will be under enormous pressure.  \n\n\nMissiles are incredibly costly, our reserves are squirreled away into storage facilities that take time to ship any large quantities to a flashpoint or theoretical front line and more important than all of that, they're incredibly time intensive to produce. Our current manufacturing capacity isn't even close to the level of replacement required for the stocks we've gifted/leased to Ukraine. We've got deep pockets and deep stockpiles, but in a real peer to peer conflict those stockpiles are going to be under serious pressure from day 1, with adequate volumes of replacement likely to take months if not years of manufacturing build up.   \n\n\nSPAAGs on the other hand are relatively simple, ammunition is dirt cheap and in large quantities in reserve, the manufacturing capacity for it is relatively large and non complex and the vehicles themselves find uses on the battlefield ranging from localized fire support to direct infantry engagement and aerial denial.

Both have their uses, but SPAAGs in particular moving forwards are going to be crucial in dealing with swarm tactics that would otherwise deplete more advanced and costly missile defence systems.  \n\n\nI'd like to think we'd revive older SPAAG programs such as Marksman in the intermediary to try and fill this equipment gap, but what's more likely is we'll see more of our limited SPAAG reserves end up in Ukrainian hands and we'll continue to purchase missiles which ultimately leave us evermore vulnerable to cheap bang for buck swarm tactics that Russia, Iran, China and other powers are no doubt adjusting their doctrines to heavily employ as we speak.",

I was merely using it as a fun example of how cost effective these drones are, particularly for adversarial powers that are going to be going up against missile heavy air defences.   \n\n\nAs for the cost of missiles/stockpile/consumption rate, that has been exemplified almost perfectly in this conflict. Russia have burned through a large portion of their prewar stockpiles and their missile burn rate seems to be somewhat consistent with their estimated production rate each month, I'd still wager they have a large reserve, but they're not exactly flinging thousands of missiles into Ukraine every few days, either they're limited by their production rate or they're consciously limiting consumption in line with that production rate, probably a mixture of the two.  \n\n\nRamping up production for these weapons is difficult, costly and time intensive, time that we won't have at the onset of a peer to peer conflict.  \n\n\nMissiles both defensive and offensive are incredibly expensive and difficult to produce. Take a guess how many stinger missiles are produced for the US army every month? The answer is 40. Ukraine took 1400 stingers from inventory at the start of the conflict, this has since risen to around 2000 stingers. Presumably they have consumed a large number of these thusfar and this is alongside other large MANPADS donations from European states. At current rates to replenish the 1300 stingers the US have ordered in return, it's going to take nearly \\*three\\* full years of production. But don't worry, it will be shorter as production will rise by a whopping 50% by \\*2025\\*. Bringing production to a staggering 60 units... It's going to take nearly two years to bring the production rate to 60 units a month...  \n\n\nSide note, in case Stingers aren't really all that serious, the latest Patriot PAC-3MSE production is only 500 missiles per year. Wait. No it's actually 250 missiles per year and we're going to be doubling production of that over the next few years. \\*Eventually\\* it will reach 500 missiles per year. This is with the backdrop of many European nations acquiring and beginning to field Patriot, so the pressure on production here will be quite heavy.   \n\n\nThese missiles are very expensive, it's estimated the cost of the apparent Khinzal interceptions was somewhere in the region of $150M or thereabouts, and it seems they used about 30 of these missiles or PAC variants that are no longer in production, either way they will be backordered, so nearly a months worth of production... This seems sustainable in a peer to peer conflict.  \n\n\nI'm genuinely serious about missile consumption and the impact these swarm/cheap drones are going to have on our capabilities. We either prioritize the enemies more serious munitions, or we severely deplete our missile stocks in the opening of any conflict trying to eliminate the threat of these cheaper drones. Either way we have a missing link in our mitigation strategy.   \n\n\nWe don't keep our entire ammunition reserve next to the launchers, and reloading takes a significant amount of time, during which we are vulnerable. These drones are a serious problem and these are just the first generation of this type of weapon they will continue to become more effective as the lessons learned in Ukraine are applied to their design and doctrine. In the same way we're using this war as a testing ground, so are our adversaries.   \n\n\nWe're not currently prepared for a peer to peer conflict that lasts any meaningful amount of time. We ourselves may never end up in a direct conflict such as this but we should still prepare for this eventuality so that in the cases where we do assist/intervene such as Ukraine, we're able to do so in a cost effective manner that doesn't involve burning million dollar missiles on a $20K Iranian drone powered by a motorcycle engine, which brings me back to the original point and the entire purpose of both posts: SPAAG's are great and absolutely have a place in our armed forces and the inability to recognize this (mostly because Lockheed and Raytheon are too busy selling missiles) is a disaster waiting to happen.\n\n\nEDIT - The only one here bringing credible information and data to a discussion and downvoted, typical lmfao, this subreddit is less credible and more \"I upvote whatever I ideologically agree with regardless of whether it's factually accurate\" with each passing day. Maybe something is absurd, unfortunately I'm not the one that decided the pricing of this equipment nor the realities of our manufacturing situation, if you think it's absurd it might be time to examine how to solve that... These technologies aren't going away any time soon just because you think they're silly.

See [here](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2023/05/24/chinese-hypersonic-missiles-uss-general-ford-war-game/) and [here](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/02/opinion/hypersonic-missiles.html) (gamechanger!) and [here](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/biden-says-hes-concerned-about-chinese-hypersonic-missiles-2021-10-20/) and [here](https://www.thedefensepost.com/2021/10/05/hypersonic-missiles-military-tech/) and now I'm bored of finding article. But I could just go down a google news search list and fill the word count on this post of news article fretting about hypersonics. \n\nHypersonics are any vehicle traveling at Mach 5 or higher, or somewhere north of 6000kph or 3800mph. Just to put that in proportion, thats about twice the muzzle velocity of an M16, so its no nothing. But weve also had solidly hypersonic weapons since at least the invention of the ICBM, when ICBM vehicles reenter the Earth's atmosphere they travel at something north of 10,000kph. I've read as high as 12k, but I'm no rocket scientist, I just play one in Kerbal Space Program. \n\nThe 'scary' weapons are non-orbital hypersonic weapons which remain in the Earth's atmosphere for the entirety of their flight, and so have to travel very quickly through actual air and cant rely on a deorbit to get going very very fast. Again, these weapons arnt new. The SS-20 'Satan' (great name) MRBM traveled at about 7500kph and was pretty scary, to Europeans, when it was first deployed. But thats 1970s tech, and *was* banned in the IMF treaty which has collapsed without much fanfare. These new hypersonic missiles sit in this previously outlawed niche. The real 'new' feature of modern hypersonics is the so called hypersonic glide vehicle, which is a warhead delivery system which can maneuver at very very high speeds. The flaw with traditional ballistic missiles is that, as the name suggests, they fly a ballistic path. So while they go very fast, and you may have mere minutes as a ground defender to intercept them, they more or less fly straight on from the launcher to the target. An HGV maneuvers mid air so that it is much harder to track and hit, and offers the true target even less time to fire a response. Given the speeds involved you can see how even a 10sec delay could radically alter the parameters of an intercept. \n\nThe Kinzahl is def a hypersonic missile, it fits squarely into the speed category for such weapons. But its more like the SS-20, tho its range is nowhere near as impressive. It is very likely that the Kinzahl is just a traditional ballistic missile with the capability for an air launch, and thus a higher mid-flight velocity. BUT western angst over HGV technology (which is anyway, IMO, overhyped) has conflated these older-style weapons with the newer tech. You know the thing, where somebody creates a new boogeyman and then is SHOCKED to realize people have been doing that thing for literal decades? Thus the Kinzahl panic. The Kinzahl is fast, and is surely interesting technology. To get a ground based cruise missile to launch from a heavy interceptor like the Mig-31 is a legit accomplishment. But its also not particularly shocking that the Patriot has been able to shoot it down, the Kinzahl is based on older tech (the Iskander missile) and is the *exact* kind of threat Patriot designers have spent the last 30 years building towards. Its the kind of missile that Iran or NK would shoot in the kind of 'rouge actor' scenario that populates B-tier Hollywood films. \n\nBut this is how the defense boogeyman thing goes. Someone who would know says 'hey this thing is concerning and we should address it.' Then it gets picked up by media who should act better, but doesnt, who publishes pieces like I linked above giving systems wildly inflated capabilities. Neither Russia nor the US Army will challenge that view in public, since they like the end results. So we don't really know what the truth is right up until the weapon actually debuts and we realize that, oh no, its actually kinda shit. Evolutionary not revolutionary. Almost the exact thing happened with the Mig-25, which is the papa design for the Mig-31, and it lead to the F-15 which is what the USAF *thought* the Mig-25 was gunna be. Oops. Happens once, happens a hundred times.",

        "body": "If you feel the need to roll your eyes at something, [there's a video going around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-rHBRwdql8) in the pro-RU circles recently of Professor Mearsheimer saying that Ukraine is doomed, and that it cannot hope to inflict a strategic defeat on Russia. If you haven't heard of Mearsheimer before, he [has a lot of videos on YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrMiSQAGOS4) showing the perspective of this conflict from the Russian POV in a way that's more persuasive to Western audiences. He's staked his career on trying to justify Russia's actions as just recompense for the sins of the West, principally the US. Some highlights include:\n\n* Russia thinks this war is an existential crisis, and that the US wants to balkanize them like they did in the 90s. When pressed on this issue, he simply says \"it doesn't matter whether or not that's true, all that matters is what they believe.\"\n\n* He thinks Russia will push further and end up successfully annexing the four oblasts to the west of the ones they've already claimed, including Odessa and Kharkiv, and additional territory east of the Dnieper. Russia will do everything it can to \"wreck\" Ukraine and keep it as a rump, dysfunctional state. The US is ultimately to blame for this all because of the Bucharest Declaration in 2008.\n\n* He thinks people in the West are also beginning to see this conflict as an existential threat, since if the West loses it could destroy NATO, which would leave Europe helplessly exposed and the US without its strongest ally against China. \n\n* On the battlefield, while Ukraine had the upper hand at the end of 2022, after mobilization the Russians would regain the initiative, and they're unlikely to lose it for a long time. The fact that Ukraine lost Bakhmut and are delaying the start of their counteroffensive confirms this in his eyes.\n\n* This is a war of attrition, and all wars of attrition are decided by 3 factors: 1) The balance of resolve between the two sides; 2) The population size of the two sides; and 3) The amount of artillery on the two sides. The third factor, artillery, is by far the most important since it is \"the king of battle\". In terms of resolve, the two sides are tied since Russia sees this as an existential conflict. In terms of population, Ukraine was at a huge disadvantage before the war (3.5:1) and are now in an even worse state due to refugees and lost territory (5:1). In terms of artillery, Ukraine is catastrophically outnumbered, somewhere between 5:1 to 10:1. \n\n* He admits that casualty numbers are hard to come by, but he estimates that 2 Ukrainians die for every 1 Russian, due principally to the artillery imbalance mentioned above. He indicates a 3:1 or even 4:1 ratio isn't out of the question, but that it *must* at least be 2:1. Apart from a few, very minor engagements, the Russians are not engaging in frontal assaults; rather, they're \"using their infantry in small packets to smoke out the Ukrainians, and then pouring huge amounts of artillery onto their positions\". \n\n* Because of this, Ukraine is facing a desperate long-term manpower shortage that's led to them kidnapping septuagenarians off the street and putting them into uniform. He claims nothing even remotely close to this has happened in Russia. \n\n* There will be no lasting peace agreement anytime soon. At best, this will turn back into a frozen conflict since the aims of the two sides are irreconcilable.\n\nIn the Q&A that followed, there were more interesting tidbits:\n\n* Someone brought up Hersh's claim that the US bombed the Nordstream pipeline, and he agreed that the US was certainly the most likely culprit. \n\n* He thinks Finland and Sweden shouldn't have feared Russia, and definitely shouldn't have snuck into NATO. \n\n* He thinks Biden could have easily prevented the war by working out a deal with Putin that took Russian security concerns seriously. \n\n* He thinks the West won't stop supporting Ukraine any time soon, but will keep doubling down and end up with another long-running disaster like Vietnam or Afghanistan.\n\n* He thinks Russia will have no more territorial ambitions beyond the 8 oblasts they end up with, because they'll spend the next 20-30 years doing \"population transfers\" to \"integrate\" those territories into Russia more solidly. \n\n* He thinks the F-16's basically won't end up mattering since Ukraine won't have any good pilots.\n\n* He thinks that if if looks like the Russians are going to end up losing in Ukraine, then it's \"likely\" or \"very likely\" that they'll go nuclear, again because they see this as an existential fight. \n\nDr. Mearsheimer is the R. Wendell Harrison Distinguished Service Professor in the Political Science Department at the University of Chicago, where he has taught since 1982.",

That doesn't preclude you from other great powers(like China for example) not being a security threat.\n\nAnother thing to consider is also that there's multiple ways to differentiate between security 'threats'. Military, economical, cultural, political, etc. It's possible for Ukraine to be \"hopelessly doomed\" in one of these areas, while still a threat in another. Mearsheimer never really talks about this because it's all just one security threat for him, but the conflict is to some level ideologically driven. \n\nBy Mearsheimer's logic Finland&Sweden are a security threat to Russia as well, and Russia should've invaded them by now. One can argue they aren't the same kind of 'security threat' as Ukraine of course, but to dismiss it goes completely against his whole logic. I think that's why the whole argument breaks down.\n\nFinland&Sweden \"are\" a security threat, but only in some areas; namely military. They aren't really a threat culturally or politically.

Only a misguided state would pass up an opportunity to be the hegemon in the system because it thought it already had sufficient power to survive&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, offensive neorealists such as Mearsheimer believe that a state&#39;s best strategy to increase its relative power to the point of achieving hegemony is to rely on offensive tactics. Provided that it is rational for them to act aggressively, great powers will likely pursue expansionist policies, which will bring them closer to hegemony.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Isn&#39;t this what &quot;NATO expansion&quot; is? If we accept the premise that eastern bloc countries joining NATO was deliberately pursued by the US and wasn&#39;t a result of those countries desperately wanting in, then isn&#39;t &quot;the west&quot; acting as Mearsheimer suggests they should?</p>\n\n<p>Am I misunderstanding this?

Today he was on [CNA Talks](https://www.cna.org/our-media/podcasts/cna-talks/2023/05/why-hasnt-russia-established-air-superiority) specifically covering that report and about two weeks ago he was on [This Means War](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5saWJzeW4uY29tLzQyMDA3MS9yc3M/episode/MWVkZGFiNWQtNmI5MS00M2Q5LWIwNGQtMDMyNDdlYzQ1MDE3?sa=X&ved=0CCUQz4EHahgKEwiQqOnQmY7_AhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQqBM) talking about SEAD/DEAD by NATO but in the context of the Russian war in Ukraine. One thing I found particularly interesting however was a scenario that Bronk brought up in both podcasts and seems rather worried by which is a Russian attack on Art. 5 itself in an attempt to regain conventional deterrence credibility. The basic premise is that if Russia, after the current war is over regardless of the outcome, doesn't demobilize and stays on a war footing it can plausibly rebuild it's armed forces over the course of 3-5 years as well as fixing at least some of the systemic issues that are inhibiting it today. Once this rearmament is complete, if the US becomes entangled somewhere in the Indo-Pacific such as Taiwan or Korea then Russia may seek to attack the foundations of NATO itself by attempting to undermine Art. 5. The proposed method for this is Russia invading a small sliver of a NATO country, only a few km deep sliver of unpopulated border and then rolling in as many defenses as possible to hold it. At this point the alliance is obligated to respond or abandon the principle of collective deterrence. \n\nBronk's goal in establishing this scenario is to get Europe to dedicate several squadrons of F-35s to SEAD/DEAD which he claims would allow NATO forces in Europe, even without significant US backing to establish air superiority and successfully drive back the Russians but I was more interested in people thoughts on the base scenario. On one hand it seems completely absurd but in the event of a full-blown cross-straight shootout between the US and China it's maybe not as absurd as I'd like either. I did think that the scenario itself was pretty interesting though because most fait accompli type thought experiments involve Estonia or Latvia being overrun which makes for easy decision making in the rest of the Alliance when it comes to deciding to fight or not. Are NATO members really willing to go to war with Russia directly without major US support over a few trees? Some, absolutely but I think the question is much harder to answer for some other governments.",

Given the state of the German bundeswehr, they have a lot of work cut out for them. That means more economic compromise and cooperation, longer term spending in the military, and perhaps even reintroducing conscription in some nations.

Of course, overestimating your opponent is better than underestimating, and todays problems are not always tomorrows, but the decay of the Russian military is a symptom of the broader societal and political disrepair of the Russian system. Multiple defense ministers and even Putin himself have attempted to rectify these systemic issues, but unless the culture of vranyo, the rampant corruption, and the economic power of the oligarchs are broken or at least significant eroded, it is unlikely that the Russian military can reconstitute itself effectively. Even if these things were achieved - likely over decades - it would be the result of/result in a large political upheaval that would see Putin and the current political heads ousted, something that they clearly don\u2019t want.",

As for Russian tank stockpiles, this has obviously been a hot topic for over a year now but really it depends on the numbers you trust. Military Balance put the pre-war stockpiles at approx 7k T-72s and 3k T-80s of various types, other much more conservative analysis puts the number of working and restorable tanks as of a few months ago at somewhere between 2-3k. There's no reason to believe that rate of tank refurbishment is not sustainable given current stockpiles. The total number in storage is not enough to hit 6k alone but if the balance of tank production shifts toward newer vehicles rather than restoring old ones it's absolutely within the ballpark. \n\n>All of your assumptions rely on Russia having the economic means to do any of it. \n\nThere's zero credible data that Russia's economy will completely collapse in the next few years which is what would be necessary to halt tank production. Indications that there will be some real economic pain for the country? Sure but nothing remotely close to what you're suggesting. Even Nazi Germany, at the end of the war while getting bombed and invaded was increasing tank production y.o.y. until 1945. \n\n>As for the rest, the VKS and air defenses, I dont see why those would matter.

NATO defenses and air forces are very well prepared for the VKS and have trained pretty much exclusively for decades in SEAD/DEAD situations against an enemy Russia. \n\nThe VKS alone is not a problem but I would highly disagree regarding the Russian IADS, they've proven by both sides to be highly lethal in this war and should not be underestimated. Regarding SEAD/DEAD though, who in NATO actually brings that capability to the table? If the US is at war with China then almost the entirety of it's SEAD capability will be directed toward that effort so who will do it in Europe? This is actually Bronk's point, he's arguing for greater investment in exactly this capability by European air forces. Without the US, can NATO do SEAD and without SEAD can the rest of NATO fight a rebuilt Russian army as efficiently as it needs to?\n\n>And I think it would be foolish to expect them to change in five years in any significant or even insignificant way.

Military Balance put the pre-war stockpiles at approx 7k T-72s and 3k T-80s of various types, other much more conservative analysis puts the number of working and restorable tanks as of a few months ago at somewhere between 2-3k. There&#39;s no reason to believe that rate of tank refurbishment is not sustainable given current stockpiles. The total number in storage is not enough to hit 6k alone but if the balance of tank production shifts toward newer vehicles rather than restoring old ones it&#39;s absolutely within the ballpark. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>All of your assumptions rely on Russia having the economic means to do any of it. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There&#39;s zero credible data that Russia&#39;s economy will completely collapse in the next few years which is what would be necessary to halt tank production. Indications that there will be some real economic pain for the country? Sure but nothing remotely close to what you&#39;re suggesting. Even Nazi Germany, at the end of the war while getting bombed and invaded was increasing tank production y.o.y. until 1945. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>As for the rest, the VKS and air defenses, I dont see why those would matter. We&#39;ve seen what they are capable of... against NATO they would be practically useless. There&#39;s been nothing new learned from their capabilities. NATO defenses and air forces are very well prepared for the VKS and have trained pretty much exclusively for decades in SEAD/DEAD situations against an enemy Russia. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The VKS alone is not a problem but I would highly disagree regarding the Russian IADS, they&#39;ve proven by both sides to be highly lethal in this war and should not be underestimated. Regarding SEAD/DEAD though, who in NATO actually brings that capability to the table? If the US is at war with China then almost the entirety of it&#39;s SEAD capability will be directed toward that effort so who will do it in Europe? This is actually Bronk&#39;s point, he&#39;s arguing for greater investment in exactly this capability by European air forces. Without the US, can NATO do SEAD and without SEAD can the rest of NATO fight a rebuilt Russian army as efficiently as it needs to?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>And I think it would be foolish to expect them to change in five years in any significant or even insignificant way. They</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And I think it would be profoundly foolish to blindly hope that Russia learns nothing from this war and consequently does nothing to fix any of the systemic issues inhibiting the performance of it&#39;s military.</p>\n</div>",

Seizing it would last a week, two tops. Once Troitske is taken, Russia has no means of realistically supplying the Svatove defensive line, which means they would either leave or quickly regret not leaving.\n\nPersonally I'd favor taking Troitske, then moving on to Starobilsk and down the H21 highway.

Going around that line to sever logistics is a good way to achieve your goals without losing thousands of men attacking defensive positions head-on.\n\nHonestly, if Ukraine couldn't pull off a maneuver like this, they're losing the war anyway. Zaporizhzhia has a number of water barriers as well, all of which are defended. The only reason they couldn't do a maneuver like this is if the West considers it a red line that cannot be crossed.

Peace between Europe and Russia was foundationally related to the idea that European ideals were not in competition with Russian ideals. After Euromaidan, Putin identified the EU as a geopolitical threat and started pressing on the Russkiy Mir. Thinking of Huntington's Clash of Civilizations here. At its heart, this conflict is an ideological conflict about whether Eastern European nations can freely shed Russian influence and join with Europe. Why Ukraine ended up so different from Belarus is an interesting question with deceptively complex answers.\n\nI think the United States and Europe got caught out in 2014 because they didn't realize what was happening. To some it looked like the Ukrainian state was breaking down along linguistic faultlines and Russia was acting in defense of its limited interest. To others it looked like a heavy handed covert military intervention to prevent a country from freely pursuing EU membership, especially considering the event in light of Georgia 2008.

I don't think Ukraine would be a key American or EU geo-strategic interest if Moscow was more careful in laying out a limited scope for their project.

                "body": "I'm kind of surprised that this post generated so much controversy. Based on the vote count, I'm guessing some people approved, but silently. I'm going to venture a guess that, while some of them were our resident Russian trolls, at least one or two were just people who are somewhat familiar with post-Soviet, and Eastern European politics in general, so they just nodded furiously.\n\nThe crux of the matter, I think, is that Russian authorities attempted to justify their crass disregard for international law post-factum using historical support, and did a really bad job at it, too. As a result of their really ill-conceived information campaign and completely inept diplomacy, everyone retrofitted the poorly constructed Russian arguments over the history of Crimean relations with Russia and Ukraine, largely because -- true to their \"we must control the information space\" mantra -- Russian authorities left nothing else pass to the public.\n\nSo now a large proportion of the Western audience doesn't realise that relations between the Ukrainian government and Crimean institutions and people were pretty bumpy. The even bigger crime, I think, is that this silenced the moderate voices in Crimea: by disregarding the will of Crimean citizens and confiscating legitimate grievances towards the Ukrainian government, they made pretty much any demand of Crimean citizens, even legitimate ones, sound like an attempt to justify Russia's unjustifiable invasion.\n\nI think there are two important bits of context that some Western readers here are missing: a) that the post-Soviet history of Crimea was rife with disagreement, and b) that changes and government, secession, and government intrusion are... seen a little differently in the post-Soviet world, so you should take poll results with a certain grain of salt\n\nLet's start with the former: a sizable proportion of the Western audience is familiar with Ukraine and Crimea primarily through the lens of the current conflict, so it's easy to forget a couple of things:\n\n* Crimea had a special, autonomous status within Ukraine, which was the subject of frequent tug-of-wars between authorities in Kyiv and Simferopol, and Crimean autonomy slowly dwindled over time\n* Crimea had substantial ethnic, cultural and economic ties with Russia -- disproportionately due to historical russification policies, both before and after 1917\n* The ten years between 2004 and 2014 were really tough on Ukrainian society and economy. As is usually the case with social and economic turmoil, these things deepened rifts and encouraged adversity\n\nFor some inexplicable reason, the Russisan government chose to disregard that, and pursue its goals of territorial expansion through a military intervention. \n\nAt some point they figured out it was a bad idea, but made matters worse, trying to justify things post-factum with the results of *some* (see below) polls and by bringing up legitimate historical grievances. Unsurprisingly, that didn't go very well. Legitimate decisions are the result of *votes*, not polls, and Russia poisoned votes for the foreseeable future through the referendum they held at gunpoint and their anti-Tatar and anti-Ukrainian policies afterwards. Polls -- especially those in post-Soviet Europe -- can't justify the invasion of a sovereign country. By invading, they literally disregarded the will of the Crimean people, and tried to claim the opposite. Nobody really bought it: enforcing the will of \"the people\" usually entails asking before, not after sending in the tanks.\n\nThe other thing y'all are missing is that not all political concepts carry the same weight for all people everywhere in the world.\n\nIf you were born in, say, Tiraspol, around 1950, so you were 64 when Crimea was invaded, but went to school in Sevastopol because your dad worked in the shipping industry and then you stayed and made a life there, the history of your residence is as follows. You were born in the Soviet Union, in the Moldavian SSR, although confusingly enough your home town isn't *exactly* in Moldova these days, and your dad, also born in Tiraspol, was likely born in the *Ukrainian* SSR. You moved to the Russian SFSR, then woke up in the Ukrainian SSR, in the Oblast of Crimea, which later became an Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic itself within the Ukrainian SSR, and then you finally found yourself living in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea within the independent Ukrainian state. You lived your life in two countries and four Soviet republics. If someone asks you where you were living when you were 5 or whatever it may take some effort to give a pedantic answer.\n\nThis tends to muffle people's perception of government changes. In the 1990s and even early '00s, people in this part of the world answered questions like \"Do you support unification with Russia/Ukraine/Belarus/whatever\" very lightly: they'd lived in countries that got merged, split, re-merged and had their administrative status changed their whole lives, without them being consulted, and with all that having practically no impact on their lives whatsoever. Few of them realised that this was *not* going to be the same kind of administrative changes the Soviet Union did. It seems obvious in hindsight but it really wasn't. \n\nThis coloured their response in nuances that were entirely lost on Western leaders. For instance, a sizable proportion of older residents of post-Soviet republics will emphatically say \"yes\" when asked about Soviet reunification, even though they will emphatically say \"no\" to any of the ensuing proposals: no pension reform to match the Russian system, no electoral changes, no restrictions on European travel, no mandatory conscription for their grandchildren, no legal reform to match the Russian criminal code and so on. They will answer \"yes\" in terms of \"it was better before\", in a sort of disidence against mainstream opinion, but wouldn't actually want to live in modern Russia.\n\nHowever, Western leaders looked at those polls and they thought about them in Western terms. For a Western audience, secession is a real thing, and self-determination is something that has been exercised for so long, and is so important, that would never suggest they'd renounce just to make a point. \n\nThis is *not* how things go further East, where entire generations of people have never experienced self-determination. Consequently, legitimate grievances against government policies routinely take the form of disgruntled citizens yearning for past times, and regional political parties do use these things as political tools where applicable.\n\nBut they are not purely rhetorical devices, either. Some are legitimate statements in support of political principles (e.g. greater local authority, even if it may have resulted in unification with Russia), others in support of political *fact* (i.e. actual unification with Russia), others are statements of disapproval towards the central government (i.e. some policies are worse than those a Russian government might pursue if it had authority). They are very hard to disentangle: as the parent poster mentioned, it's truly not \"as easy as [the post above it made] it sound\".",

        "body": "[**Ukrainians Were Likely Behind Kremlin Drone Attack, U.S. Officials Say** *American spy agencies do not know exactly who carried out the attack this month, but suggest it was part of a series of covert operations orchestrated by Ukraine\u2019s security services.*](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/24/us/politics/ukraine-kremlin-drone-attack.html)  \n\n\n> U.S. officials said the drone attack on the Kremlin earlier this month was likely orchestrated by one of Ukraine\u2019s special military or intelligence units, the latest in a series of covert actions against Russian targets that have unnerved the Biden administration.\n> \n> U.S. intelligence agencies do not know which unit carried out the attack and it was unclear whether President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine or his top officials were aware of the operation, though some officials believe Mr. Zelensky was not.\n> \n> The agencies reached their preliminary assessment in part through intercepted communications in which Russian officials blamed Ukraine and other communications in which Ukrainian officials said they believed their country was responsible for the attack, in which two drones were flown on May 3 toward the Kremlin, causing little damage.\n> \n> **U.S. officials say their level of confidence that the Ukrainian government directly authorized the Kremlin drone attack is \u201clow\u201d but that is because intelligence agencies do not yet have specific evidence identifying which government officials, Ukrainian units or operatives were involved.**\n> \n> The attack appeared to be part of a series of operations that have made officials in the United States \u2014 Ukraine\u2019s biggest supplier of military equipment \u2014 uncomfortable. The Biden administration is concerned about the risk that Russia will blame U.S. officials and retaliate by expanding the war beyond Ukraine.\n> \n> American spy agencies see an emerging picture of a loose confederation of Ukrainian units able to conduct limited operations inside and outside Russia, either by using their own personnel or partners working under their direction. Some of these missions could have been conducted with little, if any, oversight from Mr. Zelensky, officials said.\n> \n> **In addition to the drone attack, U.S. officials say they believe the Ukrainians were responsible for the assassination of the daughter of a prominent Russian nationalist, the killing of a pro-Russian blogger and a number of attacks in Russian towns near the border with Ukraine, the most recent of which occurred Monday.**  \n> \n> **American officials similarly view the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines \u2014 which carried natural gas from Russia to Europe \u2014 as the work of pro-Ukrainian operatives whose ties to the Ukrainian government have yet to be determined.**\n> \n> The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence, described their assessment in broad terms, but would not share the details of the intercepts. Representatives for the White House, the Central Intelligence Agency and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment.    \n> \n> Though the drone attack caused little damage, it punctured the sense of security and invincibility the Kremlin has sought to portray within Moscow despite the chaos it has created with its war in Ukraine.\n> \n> U.S. intelligence agencies\u2019 ability to determine responsibility for attacks against Russian targets has been complicated by the way Ukraine has organized its security services, which have secretive, overlapping and sometimes competing responsibilities.\n> \n> For example, the Security Service of Ukraine, the Main Directorate of Intelligence and the Ukrainian military each field their own special forces units.\n> \n> These operate with varying levels of professionalism and oversight, and they sometimes compete for resources and attention within the Ukrainian system. U.S. officials are not sure how closely, if at all, these units coordinate their activities with each other, either by design \u2014 as part of a system of compartmentalization to prevent Russian moles from learning about their operations \u2014 or because of mistrust among the services, or both.  \n> \n> **Some U.S. officials initially considered the possibility that the Kremlin drone attack might have been carried out by the Russian government in a \u201cfalse flag\u201d operation designed to provide Moscow with a pretext to escalate the conflict.**\n> \n> **But after the attack, the United States intercepted communications in which Russian officials were overheard discussing the incident and the findings of Moscow\u2019s preliminary investigation into what took place. In those internal discussions, Russian officials seemed surprised by the drone intrusion and blamed Ukraine. U.S. officials said this intelligence helped convince them that the attack was not carried out by the Russians.**  \n> \n> \u201cWatching how the Kremlin has responded suggests to me this was an embarrassment and surprise for them, and not a deliberate false flag,\u201d said Dara Massicot, a military analyst at RAND, referring to the drone attack. \u201cThe strikes also undermine the perceptions of Moscow\u2019s air space surveillance capabilities and that the Kremlin is secure \u2014 these are important perceptions they would like to maintain.\u201d\n> \n>**The United States also intercepted Ukrainian conversations in which officials said they believed that their country was responsible for the attack. But these officials appeared to have no knowledge of who within the Ukrainian system might have planned or carried it out.**\n> \n> U.S. officials say that some Ukrainian covert operatives work largely independently and without direct supervision from Mr. Zelensky or his top deputies. The officials say they do not believe Mr. Zelensky signs off on all covert operations, and the extent to which he is aware of them in advance is unclear.\n> \n> Instead, American officials said they suspect that Mr. Zelensky and his top aides have set the broad parameters of the covert campaign, leaving decisions about who and what to target to the security services and their operatives. In doing so, Mr. Zelensky and his top aides can deny knowing about them.\n> \n> U.S. officials have repeatedly cautioned Ukraine against conducting high-profile attacks inside Russia, citing the risk of escalation. They have also generally been dismissive of the effectiveness of the attacks, which they see as a distraction from the most important fight: Kyiv\u2019s campaign against Russian forces in southern and eastern Ukraine.\n> \n> U.S. officials have also publicly denied enabling or encouraging the cross-border attacks and say they do not support the use of American equipment in such operations. The Biden administration does not want Moscow to think that the United States is complicit in the attacks.\n> \n> The administration\u2019s fears that Russia will use nuclear weapons, or expand the conflict outside Ukraine, have eased, for now at least, and the Ukrainians have continued to conduct covert operations on Russian soil despite U.S. reservations.\n> \n> While the covert attacks appear to have had little effect so far on the course of the conflict in Ukraine, they have demonstrated Kyiv\u2019s ability to penetrate deep inside Russia. U.S. officials say the goal of the operations may be to bolster Ukrainian morale and to pierce the aura of invulnerability that surrounds President Vladimir V. Putin.\n> \n> Ukrainian military leaders have sometimes been reluctant to share information with the United States on war plans, concerned that Russian spies or others will learn about them, making it harder for Ukraine to surprise the enemy. The Ukrainians have been especially tight-lipped about their covert operations.\n> \n> The drone attack on the Kremlin took place in the early morning hours of May 3, several days before Russia celebrated Victory Day, marking Russia\u2019s victory over Nazi Germany in World War II.  \n> \n> The first drone caused a small fire; the second drone exploded while two people were examining the roof for damage caused by the first, but they did not appear to be hurt. Russian officials said the drones were intercepted and destroyed before they could cause injuries.\n> \n> A New York Times analysis of the video of the attack showed the drones had a wingspan of about eight feet. American officials believe the two drones involved were launched from a short distance away, in or near Moscow. The drones, according to senior military officials, carried a limited explosive payload, suggesting the detonations over the Kremlin were more for shock value than an actual threat.\n> \n> Russian officials were quick to publicize the incident and said it was an attempt by Ukraine to assassinate Mr. Putin.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/24/us/politics/ukraine-kremlin-drone-attack.html\"><strong>Ukrainians Were Likely Behind Kremlin Drone Attack, U.S. Officials Say</strong> <em>American spy agencies do not know exactly who carried out the attack this month, but suggest it was part of a series of covert operations orchestrated by Ukraine\u2019s security services.</em></a>  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>U.S. officials said the drone attack on the Kremlin earlier this month was likely orchestrated by one of Ukraine\u2019s special military or intelligence units, the latest in a series of covert actions against Russian targets that have unnerved the Biden administration.</p>\n\n<p>U.S. intelligence agencies do not know which unit carried out the attack and it was unclear whether President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine or his top officials were aware of the operation, though some officials believe Mr. Zelensky was not.</p>\n\n<p>The agencies reached their preliminary assessment in part through intercepted communications in which Russian officials blamed Ukraine and other communications in which Ukrainian officials said they believed their country was responsible for the attack, in which two drones were flown on May 3 toward the Kremlin, causing little damage.</p>\n\n<p><strong>U.S. officials say their level of confidence that the Ukrainian government directly authorized the Kremlin drone attack is \u201clow\u201d but that is because intelligence agencies do not yet have specific evidence identifying which government officials, Ukrainian units or operatives were involved.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The attack appeared to be part of a series of operations that have made officials in the United States \u2014 Ukraine\u2019s biggest supplier of military equipment \u2014 uncomfortable. The Biden administration is concerned about the risk that Russia will blame U.S. officials and retaliate by expanding the war beyond Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>American spy agencies see an emerging picture of a loose confederation of Ukrainian units able to conduct limited operations inside and outside Russia, either by using their own personnel or partners working under their direction. Some of these missions could have been conducted with little, if any, oversight from Mr. Zelensky, officials said.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In addition to the drone attack, U.S. officials say they believe the Ukrainians were responsible for the assassination of the daughter of a prominent Russian nationalist, the killing of a pro-Russian blogger and a number of attacks in Russian towns near the border with Ukraine, the most recent of which occurred Monday.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p><strong>American officials similarly view the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines \u2014 which carried natural gas from Russia to Europe \u2014 as the work of pro-Ukrainian operatives whose ties to the Ukrainian government have yet to be determined.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence, described their assessment in broad terms, but would not share the details of the intercepts. Representatives for the White House, the Central Intelligence Agency and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment.    </p>\n\n<p>Though the drone attack caused little damage, it punctured the sense of security and invincibility the Kremlin has sought to portray within Moscow despite the chaos it has created with its war in Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>U.S. intelligence agencies\u2019 ability to determine responsibility for attacks against Russian targets has been complicated by the way Ukraine has organized its security services, which have secretive, overlapping and sometimes competing responsibilities.</p>\n\n<p>For example, the Security Service of Ukraine, the Main Directorate of Intelligence and the Ukrainian military each field their own special forces units.</p>\n\n<p>These operate with varying levels of professionalism and oversight, and they sometimes compete for resources and attention within the Ukrainian system. U.S. officials are not sure how closely, if at all, these units coordinate their activities with each other, either by design \u2014 as part of a system of compartmentalization to prevent Russian moles from learning about their operations \u2014 or because of mistrust among the services, or both.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Some U.S. officials initially considered the possibility that the Kremlin drone attack might have been carried out by the Russian government in a \u201cfalse flag\u201d operation designed to provide Moscow with a pretext to escalate the conflict.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>But after the attack, the United States intercepted communications in which Russian officials were overheard discussing the incident and the findings of Moscow\u2019s preliminary investigation into what took place. In those internal discussions, Russian officials seemed surprised by the drone intrusion and blamed Ukraine. U.S. officials said this intelligence helped convince them that the attack was not carried out by the Russians.</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWatching how the Kremlin has responded suggests to me this was an embarrassment and surprise for them, and not a deliberate false flag,\u201d said Dara Massicot, a military analyst at RAND, referring to the drone attack. \u201cThe strikes also undermine the perceptions of Moscow\u2019s air space surveillance capabilities and that the Kremlin is secure \u2014 these are important perceptions they would like to maintain.\u201d</p>\n\n<p><strong>The United States also intercepted Ukrainian conversations in which officials said they believed that their country was responsible for the attack. But these officials appeared to have no knowledge of who within the Ukrainian system might have planned or carried it out.</strong></p>\n\n<p>U.S. officials say that some Ukrainian covert operatives work largely independently and without direct supervision from Mr. Zelensky or his top deputies. The officials say they do not believe Mr. Zelensky signs off on all covert operations, and the extent to which he is aware of them in advance is unclear.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, American officials said they suspect that Mr. Zelensky and his top aides have set the broad parameters of the covert campaign, leaving decisions about who and what to target to the security services and their operatives. In doing so, Mr. Zelensky and his top aides can deny knowing about them.</p>\n\n<p>U.S. officials have repeatedly cautioned Ukraine against conducting high-profile attacks inside Russia, citing the risk of escalation. They have also generally been dismissive of the effectiveness of the attacks, which they see as a distraction from the most important fight: Kyiv\u2019s campaign against Russian forces in southern and eastern Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>U.S. officials have also publicly denied enabling or encouraging the cross-border attacks and say they do not support the use of American equipment in such operations. The Biden administration does not want Moscow to think that the United States is complicit in the attacks.</p>\n\n<p>The administration\u2019s fears that Russia will use nuclear weapons, or expand the conflict outside Ukraine, have eased, for now at least, and the Ukrainians have continued to conduct covert operations on Russian soil despite U.S. reservations.</p>\n\n<p>While the covert attacks appear to have had little effect so far on the course of the conflict in Ukraine, they have demonstrated Kyiv\u2019s ability to penetrate deep inside Russia. U.S. officials say the goal of the operations may be to bolster Ukrainian morale and to pierce the aura of invulnerability that surrounds President Vladimir V. Putin.</p>\n\n<p>Ukrainian military leaders have sometimes been reluctant to share information with the United States on war plans, concerned that Russian spies or others will learn about them, making it harder for Ukraine to surprise the enemy. The Ukrainians have been especially tight-lipped about their covert operations.</p>\n\n<p>The drone attack on the Kremlin took place in the early morning hours of May 3, several days before Russia celebrated Victory Day, marking Russia\u2019s victory over Nazi Germany in World War II.  </p>\n\n<p>The first drone caused a small fire; the second drone exploded while two people were examining the roof for damage caused by the first, but they did not appear to be hurt. Russian officials said the drones were intercepted and destroyed before they could cause injuries.</p>\n\n<p>A New York Times analysis of the video of the attack showed the drones had a wingspan of about eight feet. American officials believe the two drones involved were launched from a short distance away, in or near Moscow. The drones, according to senior military officials, carried a limited explosive payload, suggesting the detonations over the Kremlin were more for shock value than an actual threat.</p>\n\n<p>Russian officials were quick to publicize the incident and said it was an attempt by Ukraine to assassinate Mr. Putin. Russia promised retaliatory measures and has been striking Ukraine with regular missile barrages, though it is unclear whether the escalation came in direct response to the drone attack.</p>\n\n<p>On the day of the drone attack, Mr. Zelensky publicly denied responsibility, asserting that Ukraine fights on its own territory, and keeps its weapons for defense of Ukraine rather than attacks in Moscow. \u201cWe didn\u2019t attack Putin,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>A shadowy network of Russian partisan groups has claimed responsibility for a number of the attacks, including the one on the Kremlin. But U.S. intelligence agencies have found no evidence that such groups are responsible for the operations, and some U.S. intelligence officials are skeptical that there are any meaningful anti-Putin resistance forces operating inside Russia.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",
