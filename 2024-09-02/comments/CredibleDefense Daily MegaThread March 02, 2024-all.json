But in general, jamming controls is much more straightforward than video. Why? Because you always jam the receiver. The receiver for controls is on the drone itself, which means that the farther it is from the operator (or relay), and the closer it is to the jammer - the more effective the jamming is. Thus you can put the emitter on or near the place you want to protect, it also doesn\u2019t need to be too powerful to be effective close range, it also doesn\u2019t emit too loud to be triangulated that easily. Exactly what you want.\n\nVideo jamming has to be directed on the operator\u2019s receiver. It needs to be more powerful and more broad, to target possible enemy operator areas. Its AoE will inherently interfere with *all the drones* in the area - both yours and enemies, if at or near jamming frequency range. It is therefore less useful, and mostly performed as as area denial or desperation.

Analog is also cheaper and easier to assemble which plays a big role. \n\nAny FPV that NATO uses will have to be encrypted of course which will make sharp manoeuvres impossible due to the latency. The only way to overcome that is to have auto-targetting in the 'last mile', like with the switchblades. An operator might control the drone manually to the target location and when the time comes to chase a target and manoeuvre around you could use AI to keep track of whatever you've told it to and leave the drone to make adjustments to the fly path itself.

Maybe.\n\n>The framework for a deal that would establish a six-week ceasefire in Gaza is in place, with Israel\u2019s agreement, and depends on Hamas agreeing to release hostages, a senior US administration official says.\n\n>\u201cThe hostages have to be released,\u201d the official tells reporters on a conference call. \u201cThe deal is basically there. But I don\u2019t want to create expectations one way or the other.\u201d\n\n[https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog\\_entry/senior-us-official-says-israel-has-agreed-to-ceasefire-deal-waiting-on-hamas/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/senior-us-official-says-israel-has-agreed-to-ceasefire-deal-waiting-on-hamas/)\n\nThe outline of the deal hasn't changed in weeks.\n\n* 1 day of ceasefire per hostage, with the initial release of 40 hostages.\n* The release of 400 terrorists, meaning a ratio of 1 Israeli for 10 Palestinian terrorist. Some terrorists convicted of murder would be released and deported to Qatar.\n* Increase of aid to around 500 trucks. Likely with the return of Hamas \"police\" guarding the trucks. Distribution likely managed by UNRWA.\n* Israeli withdrawal from the cities with the return of civilians to Northern Gaza. Man of fighting age would not be allowed to return at first.\n\nNegotiations for the release of the male hostages (while they are often called soldiers Hamas simply classifies any Israeli between 18 and 60 as a soldier) would continue. The United States, Egypt and Qatar would promise Hamas a permanent ceasefire.\n\nThe United States likely will release a plan leading to the establishment of a Palestinian state. Israel is likely to reject the plan. Because of the current drafting-crisis in Israel it's possible that Netanyahus government could fall. The Haredim are unlikely to support the draft of their man for national service.\n\nCurrent blockers:\n\n* Hamas has not provided a list of hostages alive.\n* Hamas has not yet approved the list of Palestinian terrorists to be released.\n* Hamas demands a permanent ceasefire. Some reporting in the WSJ over the last few days showed that Sinwar is pleased with the war and expects the international community to force Israel into a permanent ceasefire without the release of (all) hostages. Currently the reaction of the international community proves him right.\n\nCurrently a IDF offensive against Rafah is unlikely. There are only 5 brigades left in Gaza and for both assaults against Khan Yunis the IDF deployed an entire division. If I interpret OSINT reporting correctly all reserve formations have left Gaza.

Man of fighting age would not be allowed to return at first.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Negotiations for the release of the male hostages (while they are often called soldiers Hamas simply classifies any Israeli between 18 and 60 as a soldier) would continue. The United States, Egypt and Qatar would promise Hamas a permanent ceasefire.</p>\n\n<p>The United States likely will release a plan leading to the establishment of a Palestinian state. Israel is likely to reject the plan. Because of the current drafting-crisis in Israel it&#39;s possible that Netanyahus government could fall.
