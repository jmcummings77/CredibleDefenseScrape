Some, like Evolve Dynamics, are also focusing on technological advances designed to counter Russia's powerful electronic warfare (EW) capabilities.\n\n>By developing alternative radio link algorithms, it aims to make it harder for Russia to jam the signal from its surveillance drones, rendering them useless.\n\n>Both sides have bolstered deployment of EW systems, which can disrupt the frequencies that feed commands from the pilot to the drone, making them drop out of the sky or miss their target.\n\n>\"It's a constant ping-pong game between adversaries,\" said Mike Dewhirst, chief executive of Evolve Dynamics, who estimates there have been 85 upgrades made to the company's Sky Mantis drones over the last two-and-a-half years.\n\n>Other allies, such as Sweden, the Netherlands and Norway, have also provided Ukraine with combat drones.\n\n>Ukraine has nurtured its own private military startups to innovate and build up their domestic industry as the war enters its third year.\n\n>In total, there are now about 200 dronemakers in Ukraine and the Strategic Industries Ministry has said the country could make as many as 2 million drones this year.\n\n>With Evolve Dynamics, whose reconnaissance drones in Ukraine spy on enemy movements, military units receive parts and software updates directly from the company, allowing them, where possible, to make the changes themselves.\n\n>\"We're adding technology to existing drones, modifying them. It might be a software change, a hardware change,\" Dewhirst said.\n\n>Some military experts said immediate communication between defence companies and soldiers may become a more common feature of warfare given the rapid technological innovation.\n\n>The trend could have implications for everything from procurement to training.\n\n>\"The technology is moving very quickly.

More of a novella than anything else. \n\nWritten in quite a clipped, journalistic manner and thankfully free from embellishment.\n\nIt focuses on the defence of a town in Ukraine (pop.35,000) during the opening days of the invasion in 2022. \n\nDoubtless there will be similar books as the years go on, but it was interesting to read about such a small action this early on.\n\nHarding was on scene shortly after the battle and pieced events together by way of interviews and CCTV recorded by various locals.\n\nA few takeaways:\n\n\\- Ukrainian organised defence during the early days was hyper-local, with individual committees and mayors seeming to keep the show running. Communication was mostly through WhatsApp, Viber, Telegram and similar encrypted phone networks.\n\n\\- Communication with the professional military seemed limited. Local volunteers appeared to be employed purely in fixed defensive actions. They seemed to have burned through their ammunition rapidly and quickly rendered ineffective.\n\n\\- It seems much of effective fire that Russian forces took was chiefly based around a cadre of incredibly experienced Ukrainian professional soldiers. It appears they were deployed in very small teams. One such team in this village was only around 12 members.\n\n\\- Weapons platforms such as the NLAW seem to live up to the \u2018hype\u2019 that was created during the early days of the conflict.\n\n\\- More stories about Russian soldiers being wholly unprepared for the conflict, seemingly baffled at the extend of armed Ukrainian resistance. Lower-level soldiers seemed to have little to no idea of the larger operational picture. During one exchange with a local a Russian soldier believes he is around 200kms from Kyiv - in reality it was around 900kms.\n\n\\- Some Ukrainian civilians were sympathetic to Russian soldiers, and did aid them. Most Ukrainian civilians have personal ties to Russians and many family members in the Russian military.\n\n\\- Russian withdrawal from the area was haphazard and panicked, leaving plenty of operational equipment behind as well as quite a few stragglers and WIA.\n\n\\- Since this action most of the named civilian military-aged males in this book have been killed. One has since been implicated in corruption.\n\nIt\u2019s only a very brief read and it largely reinforces what many people here know. I can\u2019t speak for everyone but such an account of a hyper-local conflict is still very informative and helps bring important context and social factors into play.

There are no geolocations yet to prove or disprove this, as far as I know. \n\nBut some Ukrainian sources, such as the observer Bohdan Miroshnikov, are writing about ongoing battles in the area of Semenivka - which is being attacked from both the east and the south (thus, in this case, from the western bank of the Durna). He had written yesterday of a Russian advance of about 200 meters to the west of Orlivka, in the western bank of the Durna. https://t. me/myro_shnykov/5252\n\nAt the same time, the Russians over the recent days likely completed the conquest of the fields between Berdychi and Orlivka, in the eastern bank of the Durna. That said, the Durna is not exactly a river... Everyone can see from a satellite view that in its course west of Orlivka, before the Zoryansky Stavok, it's practically a ditch passing through a swampy area. \n\nAccording to Motopatriot, which has contacts with Russian soldiers, stormtroopers of the 114th Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps managed to cross the Durna and establish control over some houses in the southern end of Semenivka, between yesterday and today. Very heavy clashes are going on in the area. https://t. me/motopatriot/21022\n\nLet's note that this brigade has been continuously replenished to be able to continue the assaults, for months by men from the regiments of the Territorial Forces and in recent weeks even by small subunits of the 90th Tank Division. \n\nThere has also been some news in Berdychi. It seems that since mid-March the Russians have deployed the 137th Motorized Brigade in this area, transferring it from the Serebrianka Forest. It's a brigade raised at the end of 2023 by reforming the \"Ural\" Volunteer Battalion from Yekaterimburg; it's part of the 41st CAA and, from what we can gather from videos and from the analysis of WarSpotting, should be equipped (also?) with T-90Ms and BMP-3s. This brigade is attacking the village from the south and in recent days has managed to take the entire Sadova Street, breaking the stalemate of the last month. \n\nIn general, the area of Berdychi seems to have recently come under the operational control of the 41st CAA (previously active just in and south of Orlivka), now that the 2nd CAA should be all but exhausted - the 15th and 30th Motorized Brigades have simply had huge losses (over the last month too, in the costly attacks against Berdychi), and the 21st Motorized Brigade is being reformed in the rear to become the 27th Motorized Division. \n\nElements of the 74th Motorized Brigade (41st CAA), which is back in the battle, with support from the 3rd Spetsnaz GRU Brigade, attacked Berdychi from the east, taking all of Miru Street, thus approaching the western part of the village and the  Durna.\n\nThere are rumors of Russian advances north / north-east of Berdychi, but there is nothing to confirm this and even Russian sources are skeptical. The area under Russian control up there on Suriyak's map is somewhat overstated. In the area of Ocheretyne there isn't any Russian advance reported. The situation to the west and the south-west of Tonenke isn't easy at all, with the Russians achieving some advance, respectively, in the direction of Umanske and Pervomaiske.",

On paper it's the Russian formation (at the divisional level, therefore excluding the 1st GTA and the 8th CAA) with the largest number of MBTs, with 300+ tanks, being the only tank division in the RuAF fielding three tank regiments.

There are cases of people fighting under a regiment of the Territorial Forces and one day they are formally transferred to a \"regular\" brigade and start fighting under it. To give an example, also of the disorganization that characterizes this process, I was reading today about a serviceman from the 1308th Regiment of the Territorial Forces who had been missing since Feb. 10; the family learned that he had died on Feb. 20, then on March 6 he was transferred to the 55th Mountain Brigade, although in none of these two units there is any information about him. There are some regiments of the Territorial Forces that fight (while being subordinate to other brigades/regiments), and others that are purely distribution units that get recruits from the training to their final assigned unit.\n\nLet's also look at the case of those two rifle companies of the 6th Tank Regiment of the 90th Tank Division that became part of the 114th Motorized Brigade, which I had brought up last week. There seems to be no integration/rest period in between, or at least there are many cases where there is not. In the last week I even opened a VK account to better follow the MIA notices.

I mean, it could be a mistake, or something else, but if it were true it would mean that the replacements are coming even from other sectors. Rather, I find it incredible that units (albeit small ones) belonging to formations of the Central Military District are being put under the organic command of a former DPR unit, and this despite the command of the operations in Avdiivka being in the hands of the CMD. I would have thought that it would be seen as a \"humiliation\", let's say.

Additionally, if the sector becomes hot, the extra units are the obvious tactical reserve, so they're going to be committed, which leaves no local reserves that can rotate out the others. \n\nAt that point, that's when random units, especially TDF, are transferred to another brigade to temporarily serve under them, to try to regain the ability to conduct occasional unit rotations.

Without enough, the existing brigades aren't going to have many opportunities to leave the front lines, minus occasional short periods of &R or leave. And it's also another big factor in why the current manpower crisis is so damaging, they can't even replace losses at this point, let alone build new brigades too. \n\nAnd that doesn't even factor in that the Ukrainians have essentially ran out of trained/competent command and staff officers too.

            "body": "Ever since the Phoenix missiles have more or less done this. \n\nA modern missile comes off the rail, and as the pilot makes his launch decision the missile can decide to either loft or fly dead on. Range determines this. When a missile lofts, it usually gains 10-20kft and typically will be launched at a range beyond the limit of the missile's own radar. Once the missile reaches a preprogramed decent point, itll look down and turn on its radar. Typically at this point the solid fuel motor is burnt out and the missile will descend with built up energy. At this point the math is pretty simple, the missile will try to intersect with the target. If the target maneuvers properly and descends into thicker air the missile loses energy and its probability of kill goes down. If the target flies straight and high, the missile will impact with maximal energy, basically ensuring a kill. \n\nTo your first question, this is currently done. Most commonly modern jets will datalink with their missile, and so the attacking aircraft *should* maintain a lock for most of the attack to ensure a good flow of information to the missile. But if the lock is broken, modern missiles (but not many old missiles!) have some capability to reacquire the target. Modern missiles (but again not all older missiles!) have the capability also to take this mid-course guidance from non-launch platforms like an AWACS. \n\nTo the second, I know some missiles have experimented with thrust vectoring (IIRC the Israeli Python) but it is not widespread. The current control surfaces are fine for a lower altitude missile at the speeds of current technology. But I suspect as you move into hypersonic A2A missiles, something exactly like what you propose will become more normal. The technology is there, the need is (currently) not. \n\nTo four, missile targeting requires radar power more than any other feature. Power is ultimately a product of radar size and electrical output. Bigger radars, more power. Missiles are fundamentally limited by their small form factors, while the attack aircraft and ultimately AWACS have orders of magnitude larger, and thus more powerful, radars. This means that incorporating long range missiles into a larger radar net will remain vital so long as this relationship exists, likely through the near future. Other targeting methods (such as IR) do exist, but IR tends to be a poor substitute at range for radar, and is not commonly used anymore outside of the shorter ranged stuff like Sidewinders. IR used to have a larger role, the Soviets were big believers in long range IR missiles. THey have a pretty nice advantage in that they do not trigger radar warning equipment, for obvious reasons. So the Soviets liked them for ambush weapons. Keep in mind the Flankers were, in original design, ambush predators. But since the 90s and the introduction of the AIM-120 the range gap is just too much to be overcome by an IR armed aircraft. Going forward though, if the IR and Radar seekers could somehow be combined you may see a pretty potent missile.\n\nTo your last point, like I think youre right. I think everyone expects that is where this is all going to end up, with hypersonic aircraft launching ultra long range missiles. The technology seems to be coming towards a culmination at this point. But I think there are a few big catches. First your timeframe is, IMO, off. We just dont have a ton of great hypersonic vehicles currently, and not a ton of launch platforms to maximize use of them. Were essentially a generation behind, and probably the NGAD that everyone is working on is going to be more like the F-22 than that plane from Top Gun 2. Now, the US is *very much* working on those more advanced platforms, and may even have a few in a strike capacity. But in terms of a large fleet, *and* equipping them with A2A missiles? Not that close. There are also tactical considerations, while hypersonic A2A sounds cool there are problems. Theyre not easy to hide, and even the AIM-120 can be detected midflight by most radars. Moreover, if you need to establish a prelaunch lock, that kinda gives your hand away. All this is to say that defending against a hypersonic may not be as hard as one might first think given the ranges, and thus time, involved. Also keep in mind that ultimately its performance under 10k feet that gets you kills, high altitude launches are more about shaping the contours of an evolving fight. Which is not nothing, but the number of R-37 kills in Ukraine is, AFAIK, rather limited. So what youre describing is a way to maximize *some* aspects of air to air combat, but not necessarily in ways that splash enemy airframes or totally guarantee air superiority. Especially if you envision a future where the enemy is *also* launching hypersonics at you at 1000mi. And the ultimate wrinkle here is stealth. Stealth is a hard counter to this kind of long range thinking simply because you may not see an F-22 at 1000mi, or 500, or 100. So if you only see him when hes in range to launch a -120D or -220 or whatever, what has the hypersonic gotten you? \n\nAir combat remains very complicated, and will only get moreso in the future.",

You can go read the declassified State Department internal discussions from the time to get a blow-by-blow of both the 1973 Yom Kippur War and the US' diplomatic engagement with Egypt during the war.\n\n\nThe major effect of the war was to completely change the Israeli calculus about Arab military strength. Before the war, the Israelis were sure of themselves, to the point of arrogance.

Their goal was to recapture the Sianai, and avenge their defeat in 1967, that very quickly became impossible. Agreeing to the US supported deal was the only way to salvage the situation. Yes, Israel was never going to occupy Cairo, that doesn\u2019t mean the situation on the ground wasn\u2019t bad, and quickly getting worse. \n\n> This is also a pretty poor reading of Arab nations and their sentiments regarding the US and Israel, they aren\u2019t Klingons responding only to strength and decisive action.\n\nThat\u2019s why I was talking about defense and economics.

Their goal was to recapture the Sianai, and avenge their defeat in 1967, that very quickly became impossible. Agreeing to the US supported deal was the only way to salvage the situation. Yes, Israel was never going to occupy Cairo, that doesn\u2019t mean the situation on the ground wasn\u2019t bad, and quickly getting worse. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is also a pretty poor reading of Arab nations and their sentiments regarding the US and Israel, they aren\u2019t Klingons responding only to strength and decisive action.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That\u2019s why I was talking about defense and economics. Idealism is a distant third concern, if one at all, in most cases.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It\u2019s also underestimating just how bad Americas position in the Middle East has become. Egypts already pretty flagrantly violating the Camp David Accords in the Sinai and GIS is facilitating the flow of arms from the Sinai to Hamas if not supplying them with munitions directly (before you talk about the Muslim Brotherhood, GIS has gotten much closer to Hamas since 2015 and both have collaborated to fight ISIS in the Sinai). </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I\u2019m aware of how bad the situation is, although Egypt moving troops into the Sinai isn\u2019t one of those issues.
