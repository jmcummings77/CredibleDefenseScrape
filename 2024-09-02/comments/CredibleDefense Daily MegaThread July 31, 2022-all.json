This document is part of the ATP 7-100 series that addresses a nation-state\u2019s military doctrine with a focus on army ground forces and tactical operations in offense, defense, and related mission sets. Other foundational topics include task organization, capabilities, and limitations related to military mission and support functions. ATP 7-100.3 serves as a foundation for understanding how Chinese ground forces think and act in tactical operations. This publication presents multiple examples of functional tactics in dynamic operational environment conditions. The tactics in this ATP are descriptive, and provide an orientation to tactics gathered from Chinese doctrine, translated literature, and observations from recent historical events.\n\nA link to the entire report in a PDF:\n\nhttps://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/DR_pubs/DR_a/ARN33195-ATP_7-100.3-000-WEB-1.pdf\n\nHere is an Audiobook version, so you can listen to it:\n\nhttps://rdl.train.army.mil/catalog-ws/view/ATP7-100.3Audiobook/index.html\n\nThe guest is part of the team that created the official document for the US Army, and will have a reddit flair on their username that distinguishes them as being verified by the mod team.

In addition to relocating our scenarios to East Asian and Eastern European battlefields, MCCC rebuilt our scenario threats to reflect the modernizing armies of China and Russia while remaining decisive action training environment (DATE) compliant. Now, over 60% of MCCC\u2019s scenarios feature DATE threat actors resembling the Chinese formations described in ATP 7-100.3 Chinese Tactics. The remaining 40% of our tactical scenarios are based on the current Russian military, and MCCC plans to design a similar foundational block on the Russian Army upon the publication of ATP 7-100.1 Russian Tactics.

As a result they will likely face gas shortages this winter, which will be remedied by shutting down industries temporarily and maybe incentivising consumers to heat their homes a bit less. As a rule of thumb, EU members [plan to](https://www.ft.com/content/eac9498f-6a36-41a9-b577-fa37c0eeab76)(and will) have substituted two thirds of Russian gas imports by the end of this year, taking the example of Germany where Russian gas until February [represented a little less than 50% of gas consumption](https://www.tagesschau.de/wirtschaft/weltwirtschaft/gas-stopp-faq-101.html) if Russia keeps the taps open Russian gas will supply about 15% of German gas consumption - correspondingly if Russia shuts the tabs Germany will have to reduce consumption by 15%. [Between January and May of this year Germany reduced its gas consumption by 14.3%](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/gasversorgung-deutsche-industrie-verbraucht-deutlich-weniger-gas/28470182.html) compared to the same period last year just as a reaction to the increased prices, with some incurred difficulties in industrial production but nothing close to the earth-shattering problems you\u2019d expect from what people on the internet are saying. Granted this is only an early sign that gas consumption reduction is possible, but it\u2019s a good sign nonetheless. Germany also consumes around [12%](https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/37985/umfrage/verbrauch-von-erdgas-in-deutschland-nach-abnehmergruppen-2009/) of its gas for electricity production - as coal power plants are being restarted, that consumption will drop as well. With all that said it looks like Germany will be able to weather the storm with a much lower impact than many people suggest. \n\nRussia on the other hand depends on imports for, well, _a lot_ of things.

Same thing with things like electronics, or any kind of sophisticated machinery that goes into sophisticated consumer products like cars, for example. Basically most sectors of the Russian industry can\u2019t function without western parts and machinery. Without the proper manufactured goods (think computers or trucks or whatnot) most other sectors of the economy will not be able to function properly either. You\u2019re right that China could step in and provide many of these imported goods, though definitely not all of them, but until now they\u2019ve been reluctant to do so - by all indicators Chinese exports to Russia are down significantly. The reason is that typically the Chinese producers export these products to both the US and Russia, and the US has systematically put Chinese exporters of key technology to Russia, especially of electronics, on sanctions list. These companies therefore have to choose between selling their products to Russia or America, and for the overwhelming majority of them America is a much much more important market.

As a result they will likely face gas shortages this winter, which will be remedied by shutting down industries temporarily and maybe incentivising consumers to heat their homes a bit less. As a rule of thumb, EU members <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eac9498f-6a36-41a9-b577-fa37c0eeab76\">plan to</a>(and will) have substituted two thirds of Russian gas imports by the end of this year, taking the example of Germany where Russian gas until February <a href=\"https://www.tagesschau.de/wirtschaft/weltwirtschaft/gas-stopp-faq-101.html\">represented a little less than 50% of gas consumption</a> if Russia keeps the taps open Russian gas will supply about 15% of German gas consumption - correspondingly if Russia shuts the tabs Germany will have to reduce consumption by 15%. <a href=\"https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/gasversorgung-deutsche-industrie-verbraucht-deutlich-weniger-gas/28470182.html\">Between January and May of this year Germany reduced its gas consumption by 14.3%</a> compared to the same period last year just as a reaction to the increased prices, with some incurred difficulties in industrial production but nothing close to the earth-shattering problems you\u2019d expect from what people on the internet are saying. Granted this is only an early sign that gas consumption reduction is possible, but it\u2019s a good sign nonetheless. Germany also consumes around <a href=\"https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/37985/umfrage/verbrauch-von-erdgas-in-deutschland-nach-abnehmergruppen-2009/\">12%</a> of its gas for electricity production - as coal power plants are being restarted, that consumption will drop as well.

Also an underrated topic is that Ukriane's heaviest and well prepared fortifications are around the Donbass region, west of the Dnieper River there are no such heavy fortifications except in Odessa.\n\nZelensky himself has stated Ukrainian armed forces now number approximately 700,000 while there is no indication Russia has gradually increased it's initial size of 180,000-200,000 (+ DPR/LPR militias), except for replenishing losses. Granted the 700,000 isn't in full force at the front lines, but Ukrainian forces still outnumber Russian forces 3:1 in Ukraine.\n\nBy NATO standards a regiment becomes ineffective once it suffers a ~~5-10%~~ 10-15% casualty rate, and must be cycled or replenished to be combat effective. Ukrainian regiments are suffering upwards of 50-80% attrition rates and yet are still being fielded.\n\nAlso consider despite NATO's military budget exceeding Russia's tenfold, they were/are completely unprepared for conventional industrialized warfare, because they foolishly relied on tech fetishism instead. Russia has already used 3x the number of missiles in a few months than the U.S produces in an entire year, France's missile stockpiles are already depleted 1/4-1/3 their original size, and UK's military admitted at Russia's rate of fire they'd run out of artillery in 2 days and all effective heavy munitions by the 8th day.\n\nFeel free to request sources regarding any parts of my statement, ask and ye shall receive.",

Russia has the vast numerical manpower and firepower advantage, and has yet to do a real large scale mobilization. While Ukraine has already mobilized and even enacted conscription, something Russia hasn't deemed necessary (yet). Although Russia does need to maintain a number of forces to guard borders and other domestic duties, it still has a larger well to draw manpower from.\n\nOn a final note, consider that Ukraine had one of the lowest birth rates in Europe even before this war began, and has lost tens of thousands (likely more) of young men already. What you're advocating for, a mass mobilization of a nation that's on the losing end of a war and with critically low birthrates would demographically devastate Ukraine for generations. A fate far worse than just losing Donbass and Crimea, so IMO Ukraine should negotiate sooner rather than later, before Russia breaks through the last of the fortifications (that were built up over a period of 8 years) around Donbass.\n\nIf the war continues on it's current trajectory, Russia gradually gaining territories and Ukraine failing to recapture any significant territory or launch any successful counter-offensives, Ukraine stands to lose far more and will find itself losing more lands and in a *considerably* weaker position to negotiate a peace deal.",

Although Russia does need to maintain a number of forces to guard borders and other domestic duties, it still has a larger well to draw manpower from.</p>\n\n<p>On a final note, consider that Ukraine had one of the lowest birth rates in Europe even before this war began, and has lost tens of thousands (likely more) of young men already. What you&#39;re advocating for, a mass mobilization of a nation that&#39;s on the losing end of a war and with critically low birthrates would demographically devastate Ukraine for generations. A fate far worse than just losing Donbass and Crimea, so IMO Ukraine should negotiate sooner rather than later, before Russia breaks through the last of the fortifications (that were built up over a period of 8 years) around Donbass.</p>\n\n<p>If the war continues on it&#39;s current trajectory, Russia gradually gaining territories and Ukraine failing to recapture any significant territory or launch any successful counter-offensives, Ukraine stands to lose far more and will find itself losing more lands and in a <em>considerably</em> weaker position to negotiate a peace deal.</p>\n</div>",

Russia had 1,000,000 in active forces, they committed 200,000 which includes support and combat roles at 3:1 (rough estimate). (...) Of the 1,000,000 active forces, 755,000 remains\n\nThis is misleading. First, let's look at the personnel breakdown of the Russian Armed Forces as it stood just before the invasion:\n\n1. Ground Forces: ***280,000***\n2. Aerospace Forces: 165,000\n3. Navy: 150,000\n   1. Of which ***35,000*** serve in the Marine Corps\n4. Strategic Missile Forces: 50,000\n5. Airborne Troops: ***45,000***\n6. General Staff + Material and technical support: 210,000\n   1. Of which 29,000 serve in the Railway Troops\n   2. Of which another **1,000** serve in the Special Operations Forces of the GRU\n\nI've bolded the services which constitute the land forces. They amount in total to ***361,000 men***.\n\nOf these 361,000 men, [\\~121,000 are conscripts](https://russiandefpolicy.com/tag/conscription/) undergoing their 1-year term of service and, as such, cannot be deployed to Ukraine. This leaves ***\\~240,000*** officers, NCOs and contract soldiers serving in the land forces.\n\nAt the beginning of the invasion, Russia deployed ***\\~150,000*** of these \\~240,000 men, amounting to almost 2/3 of the total force. Since then, some of the remaining ***\\~90,000*** have been deployed as reinforcements to Ukraine, some (mainly officers) have been used as cadres to create new volunteer battalions, and some have remained as cadres among conscript units or to man the (few) combat units Russia has kept in reserve to secure its national territory.\n\nIn effect, Russia is fully committed and has barely any immediately deployable land forces personnel left.\n\n>approximately 2,000,000 trained reservists.\n\nRussia doesn't have 2,000,000 trained reservists. It has perhaps \\~1.5 million men, nominally in reserve, who have had military experience within the previous 5 years. The overwhelming majority of said men are former yearly conscripts whose combat value is, at best, dubious, and who have no units left to report to anyway, given that virtually all Russian units are now either (1) fighting in Ukraine or (2) have been raided of their cadre to establish volunteer battalions.\n\n>Ukraine can't close the firepower superiority gap that Russia has, which ranges from 10:1 - 15:1.\n\nPerhaps - although I'm unconvinced by the higher-end estimates. In any case, and despite said Russian superiority in indirect fires, their forces have barely made any advances since the end of the battle of the Sievierodonetsk salient. Ukraine is also - soundly - targeting Russian ammunition depots with their own long-range fires, thereby restricting Russia's ability to fully capitalize on their one major advantage.",
                                            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>Let&#39;s do some napkin math. Russia had 1,000,000 in active forces, they committed 200,000 which includes support and combat roles at 3:1 (rough estimate). (...) Of the 1,000,000 active forces, 755,000 remains</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is misleading. First, let&#39;s look at the personnel breakdown of the Russian Armed Forces as it stood just before the invasion:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Ground Forces: <strong><em>280,000</em></strong></li>\n<li>Aerospace Forces: 165,000</li>\n<li>Navy: 150,000\n\n<ol>\n<li>Of which <strong><em>35,000</em></strong> serve in the Marine Corps</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li>Strategic Missile Forces: 50,000</li>\n<li>Airborne Troops: <strong><em>45,000</em></strong></li>\n<li>General Staff + Material and technical support: 210,000\n\n<ol>\n<li>Of which 29,000 serve in the Railway Troops</li>\n<li>Of which another <strong>1,000</strong> serve in the Special Operations Forces of the GRU</li>\n</ol></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve bolded the services which constitute the land forces. They amount in total to <strong><em>361,000 men</em></strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Of these 361,000 men, <a href=\"https://russiandefpolicy.com/tag/conscription/\">~121,000 are conscripts</a> undergoing their 1-year term of service and, as such, cannot be deployed to Ukraine. This leaves <strong><em>~240,000</em></strong> officers, NCOs and contract soldiers serving in the land forces.</p>\n\n<p>At the beginning of the invasion, Russia deployed <strong><em>~150,000</em></strong> of these ~240,000 men, amounting to almost 2/3 of the total force. Since then, some of the remaining <strong><em>~90,000</em></strong> have been deployed as reinforcements to Ukraine, some (mainly officers) have been used as cadres to create new volunteer battalions, and some have remained as cadres among conscript units or to man the (few) combat units Russia has kept in reserve to secure its national territory.</p>\n\n<p>In effect, Russia is fully committed and has barely any immediately deployable land forces personnel left.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>approximately 2,000,000 trained reservists.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Russia doesn&#39;t have 2,000,000 trained reservists. It has perhaps ~1.5 million men, nominally in reserve, who have had military experience within the previous 5 years. The overwhelming majority of said men are former yearly conscripts whose combat value is, at best, dubious, and who have no units left to report to anyway, given that virtually all Russian units are now either (1) fighting in Ukraine or (2) have been raided of their cadre to establish volunteer battalions.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ukraine can&#39;t close the firepower superiority gap that Russia has, which ranges from 10:1 - 15:1.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Perhaps - although I&#39;m unconvinced by the higher-end estimates. In any case, and despite said Russian superiority in indirect fires, their forces have barely made any advances since the end of the battle of the Sievierodonetsk salient. Ukraine is also - soundly - targeting Russian ammunition depots with their own long-range fires, thereby restricting Russia&#39;s ability to fully capitalize on their one major advantage.</p>\n</div>",

Right now Russia can still negotiate from a position of strength because they can simply say no and continue taking more UA territory.
