Crucial categories of industry for U.S. national defense are no longer built in any of the 50 states. With just 25 well-constructed attacks, using any of a variety of means, an adversarial military planner could cripple much of America\u2019s manufacturing apparatus for producing advanced weapons.\u201d\n\nSome noteworthy quotes:\n\n> many essential components in sensitive U.S. military systems now come from China. [...]  During a May 2023 visit to a Lockheed Martin missile factory in Alabama, President Joe Biden told employees that each Javelin anti-tank weapon produced there includes more than 200 semiconductors. Analysis from Ark.ai has found that more than 40% of the semiconductors that sustain DoD weapons systems and infrastructure depend on Chinese suppliers (Figure 4). Chinese semiconductor suppliers are inextricably linked to vital DoD weapons supply chains, such as the B-2 Bomber and Patriot air-defense missile (Figure 5).\n\nWhen looking at the reasons for why this has occurred, Govini finds that:\n\n> A few mega-sized prime defense contractors sit atop a supply chain pyramid of tens of thousands of mid-to-small businesses. When the first tier curtails throughput, orders to smaller suppliers dry up. Some businesses may entirely close. In fact, many have left the defense industry over the last several decades\u2013deciding to employ their limited time, talent, and capital in the larger and more lucrative commercial sector. Estimates indicate that the number of small to midsize contractors forming the bottom of the pyramid has shrunk from approximately 60,000 to 30,000 over recent decades.\n\nRegarding high end long-range fires like TLAM, JASSM, LRASM, et al. Govini finds:\n\n> These long-range weapons are also vulnerable to the same supply chain challenges that plague the broader American industrial base. Adversarial influence is endemic to their production. Chinese companies are embedded in the supply chains of subcontractors to defense primes across system components such as electronics, software, fuses and detonators, and data links. Tracing these connections reveals an adversarial presence in critical long-range systems (Figure 6).\n\nWhile most of the pdf is focused on the same general talking points that is frequently found in popular discourse (we need to ramp up shipbuilding, we need to divest from Chinese suppliers), the more interesting parts is that Govini has named a number of Chinese semiconductor suppliers for systems that go into the B2, Minutemen III, Ohio SSBN, and Patriot missiles, as well as the DLA authorized suppliers who act as intermediaries that purchase from the Chinese companies. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/ZwkuSGH.png\n\nThere are some more conspiratorial takes that will likely emerge from this, like the (frankly very stupid) idea of \"poisoned\" microchips that was popularized in some milfic book whose title I can't recall at this moment. But I believe more research needs to be done in the field of finding suppliers in smaller, seemingly more \"mundane\" components that go into critical systems. From the r/lcd thread that this was originally posted in, someone mentioned the rumor that had been circulating the Chinese internet for years that a US company sourced steel of a very specific and high-quality specifications from a Chinese company, and when the PLAN started looking for a supplier for their own arresting cables on their carriers, a single company without heavy government subsidies was able to provide them with the exact type of steel needed because they've made it before. \n\nBeing able to manufacture the sub-components to spec, put them into their own weapons systems, and then develop CONOPS for how to use and counter said weapons all contribute to giving China a deeper familiarity with our systems than we should be comfortable with. And crucially, this is different than the US sourcing titanium from the Soviet Union during the Cold War, which took place at the start of the supply chain (i.e. raw materials) and not at manufactured components. \n\nComponents to data links, propulsion, seekers, and even software all reveal part of a greater whole that can then be reverse-engineered with sufficient technical skill. \n\nThe other side is: because these are sourced from China, in a war, Chinese suppliers will be banned by the PRC government from dealing with foreign buyers, which will lead to disruption in our own ability to procure and produce weapons for ourselves. But Chinese weapons companies will not face this constraint, and may even be able to procure additional munitions at cheaper prices than before because the production capacity that would've otherwise be exported to the US will likely be directed to domestic needs. \n\nThe worst part is they didn't steal *any* of this. It was practically *given* to them by contractors looking to save a dime. The Forbes article ends with a fairly ominous note:\n\n> Govini\u2019s study does not offer information on the emerging hypersonic weapons sector but given that the U.S. players are the same as those above, it\u2019s reasonable to expect a similar level of Chinese participation. The lesson here is also that if America at long last actually succeeds in bolstering its weapons stocks, the benefits extend to Beijing.\n\n-----\n\nAnd this isn't a US-specific problem either, nor is it constrained to the high end munitions.

Obviously, I'm extracting this from the behaviour of the two sides and combat footage, which is hardly scientific work, so I'd love to see a professional analyst tackle this.  \n\nFirst, use of tanks for indirect fire has a long history in the Soviet Union. Since the breakup, the Russians used the technique extensively during the Chechen War in particular but also the Donbas War. The Ukrainians used it extensively in the Donbas War too. They have the knowledge to do it embedded in their military culture, it's not something either needed to create from scratch for this war (similar to using automatic machine guns for indirect fire).\n\nSecond, COMBLOC tanks possess legit HE-Frag rounds that most Western militaries got rid of to streamline anti-tank ammo, with HEAT being used for anti-personnel (though not being great at it). But that HE-Frag ammo is pretty effective, though the low trajectory limits the fragmentation effect. This is important because it takes the pressure off of mortars, tube arty, and rocket artillery as another weapon system that can provide long range fires with high explosives. \n\nThird, using tanks for indirect gives tank crews a meaningful daily use especially in this war, where both sides have very good reasons to be risk adverse sending them forward massed in platoon strength or higher (fodder for Recon Fires Complex), and where their mission planning is already overwhelming the limited command and staff time they'd need to coordinate complex combined arms operations of the sort that dominate modern tank tactics. \n\nThat creates a few realities:\n1. There are a lot of tanks near the front lines at any given area, with ammo \n2. It's very dangerous to keep them on the front lines, especially to perform massed assaults\n3. It's very hard to organize attacks or counterattacks. \n4. There is motivation to find a use for them\n\nA tank performing indirect fire hardly needs to coordinate anything, especially if they have their own drone to either find targets but specifically to adjust fire. If they have those, an individual tank in a hide site near the front lines but not on it can fire and make hits, especially on static targets, without involving anyone in their chain of command for support, minus resupply. At worst, they need someone to relay targets to them, which isn't much. \n\nFor tank platoon and company commanders, it's the ultimate easy job. With a few hours of \"training\" a crew can figure out how to do it and then leave them to it, with the only worry being whether or not an enemy drone can spot them and engage, but that would be a threat anyway if they're remotely close to the front lines, which they'll often need to be (at least some tanks must remain close by to assist with immediate counterattacks). \n\nSpeaking of counterattacks, with so many of the assaults in this conflict being squad level dismounted infantry assaults taking squad level defensive positions, it doesn't take much to dislodge them and force a retreat. A single tank pounding away at a recently occupied enemy position, especially as they are trying to consolidate, evacuate wounded from the earlier attack, get resupplied, dig in, etc, might be enough to cause them to retreat at the first opportunity to their chain of command that while they were able to take the ground, they couldn't hold it. Add in a small counterattacking dismount squad teamed with the individual tank doing long range IDF, it's pretty easy to coordinate, much easier than having the tank actually advance, which requires route planning, dealing with mines, enemy ATGM threat, enemy drones that'll catch them moving easier, and basically every weapon system but most especially FPVs that'll have an easier time hitting the tanks in the open versus in hide positions a few kilometers away.",

If they have those, an individual tank in a hide site near the front lines but not on it can fire and make hits, especially on static targets, without involving anyone in their chain of command for support, minus resupply. At worst, they need someone to relay targets to them, which isn&#39;t much. </p>\n\n<p>For tank platoon and company commanders, it&#39;s the ultimate easy job. With a few hours of &quot;training&quot; a crew can figure out how to do it and then leave them to it, with the only worry being whether or not an enemy drone can spot them and engage, but that would be a threat anyway if they&#39;re remotely close to the front lines, which they&#39;ll often need to be (at least some tanks must remain close by to assist with immediate counterattacks). </p>\n\n<p>Speaking of counterattacks, with so many of the assaults in this conflict being squad level dismounted infantry assaults taking squad level defensive positions, it doesn&#39;t take much to dislodge them and force a retreat. A single tank pounding away at a recently occupied enemy position, especially as they are trying to consolidate, evacuate wounded from the earlier attack, get resupplied, dig in, etc, might be enough to cause them to retreat at the first opportunity to their chain of command that while they were able to take the ground, they couldn&#39;t hold it. Add in a small counterattacking dismount squad teamed with the individual tank doing long range IDF, it&#39;s pretty easy to coordinate, much easier than having the tank actually advance, which requires route planning, dealing with mines, enemy ATGM threat, enemy drones that&#39;ll catch them moving easier, and basically every weapon system but most especially FPVs that&#39;ll have an easier time hitting the tanks in the open versus in hide positions a few kilometers away.</p>\n</div>",

If it wants to keep fighting it must take the steps it needs to survive a lengthy war of attrition against Russia. </p>\n\n<p>And that&#39;s where Kofman and Grady came up with their new strategy, they&#39;re trying to push it on the Ukrainians to adopt. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.iiss.org/online-analysis/survival-online/2024/01/making-attrition-work-a-viable-theory-of-victory-for-ukraine\">https://www.iiss.org/online-analysis/survival-online/2024/01/making-attrition-work-a-viable-theory-of-victory-for-ukraine</a></p>\n\n<p>Russia is likely never going to be as strong as they are right now, because they can&#39;t sustain the losses they&#39;re taking now in the long run. Kofman keeps saying the Russians have a 3 year plan for victory (probably told to him by senior UAF brass during visits), that they plan the war ending no later than 2026, which means they need 2025 to be just as good for them as 2024 is looking. </p>\n\n<p>Kofman&#39;s and Grady&#39;s entire strategy is basically to screw with the Russian 3 year plan. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s a bad strategy, totally reactive, but it&#39;s the only concrete way to survive 2024 and come out potentially in a better position to deal with 2025, when the arty ammo might finally be available for Ukraine to have reliable fire rates (assuming the US helps). And if they defeat the Russian plan and delay a Russian victory, maybe the Russians will quit the war (a continuation of the strategy of exhaustion at play).</p>\n</div>",

If wasn't so crazy then. \n\nPolitically, Zelensky dug himself into a hole. The maximalist goals, which pretty much amount to unconditional surrender in terms of what happens to Russia afterwards if they accept them, weren't just accepted by Zelensky, they were proposed by him. At this point, it seems he believes it'll be too unpopular to revert to minimalist goals, especially where Ukraine loses territory. \n\nI'm not even sure Zelensky even has the power to cede territory. Constitutionally, I've read claims that he doesn't have the power to permanently give away territory (though that can likely be settled by legalese in the treaty), but I think there is a very real threat from the Far Right Nationalist elements of Ukraine, the Right Sector/Azov types, who very well might object to any peace deal with Russia by way of coup or assassination attempts. \n\nThat said, Ukraine is on the cusp of losing bad, but it hasn't happened yet. Their manpower, equipment, and supply shortages might trigger something large and destructive in 2024, and if that happens then Zelensky will likely change his tune. I can't see him pulling a Hitler, and wanting to go down with the ship. He's pro-war because it polls well, he'll be anti-war when it polls well. \n\nMaybe that's why he's delaying reforms in mobilization (because he's chiefly responsible for that shitshow). If he is actively wanting this war to end, privately believes hope is lost but can't politically say that openly, and he's just waiting for the big military defeat to occur in 2024 that will politically allow him to accept poor terms for a treaty, then why would he try to fix the mobilization problem and induct hundreds of thousands of more troops? That'll delay a Russian victory.",

The maximalist goals, which pretty much amount to unconditional surrender in terms of what happens to Russia afterwards if they accept them, weren&#39;t just accepted by Zelensky, they were proposed by him. At this point, it seems he believes it&#39;ll be too unpopular to revert to minimalist goals, especially where Ukraine loses territory. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not even sure Zelensky even has the power to cede territory. Constitutionally, I&#39;ve read claims that he doesn&#39;t have the power to permanently give away territory (though that can likely be settled by legalese in the treaty), but I think there is a very real threat from the Far Right Nationalist elements of Ukraine, the Right Sector/Azov types, who very well might object to any peace deal with Russia by way of coup or assassination attempts. </p>\n\n<p>That said, Ukraine is on the cusp of losing bad, but it hasn&#39;t happened yet. Their manpower, equipment, and supply shortages might trigger something large and destructive in 2024, and if that happens then Zelensky will likely change his tune. I can&#39;t see him pulling a Hitler, and wanting to go down with the ship. He&#39;s pro-war because it polls well, he&#39;ll be anti-war when it polls well. </p>\n\n<p>Maybe that&#39;s why he&#39;s delaying reforms in mobilization (because he&#39;s chiefly responsible for that shitshow). If he is actively wanting this war to end, privately believes hope is lost but can&#39;t politically say that openly, and he&#39;s just waiting for the big military defeat to occur in 2024 that will politically allow him to accept poor terms for a treaty, then why would he try to fix the mobilization problem and induct hundreds of thousands of more troops? That&#39;ll delay a Russian victory.</p>\n</div>",

But for fun, let's do some math\n\nOne variable is the cost of a USV that the Houthis produce. From what I read, they attach warheads to jet ski engines. Presumably there are mechanisms to control the direction and speed as well, although I'm guessing due to Houthi's limitations that they can't be too sophisticated, at least relative to US military drones.\n\nLet's get an estimate of $25k per USV\n$10,000 (jet ski engine) + $5,000 (warhead) + $10,000 (modifications) = $25,000\n\nAnother variable is the number of suicide drones per swarm attack. Let's pull a number out of the air and say it's 50 USVs. The larger the number of USVs, the more likely the attack is to succeed. \n\nAnd that brings us to the next variable. The success rate of an attack with 50 USVs. Let's pull another number out of the air and say it's 5% with 50 USVs. That means on average it would take 20 attacks to sink one ship\n\nLast variable would be the cost of a navy ship, which can vary wildly. But let's say the cost is $2 billion, roughly the typical cost of a destroyer or frigate.\n\n\n\nHow much would 20 swarm attacks cost? At $25k a drone, 50 drones an attack, the cost per attack is $1.25 million. 20 attacks would then cost $25 million. \n\nSo in theory, based off these numbers, it would cost $25 million to take down a $2 billion navy ship. That's a wild asymmetry available to the Houthis and other non-state actors. \n\nOf course, you could tweak the variables (more or less drones per attack, % success rate, costs, etc) but I think we can reasonably conclude here that these USV swarm tactics must be a very serious threat.\n\nIf anybody else has more information, please share. I pulled some of these numbers out of this air just for the sake of the discussion. If someone has more accurate figures for the variables above, or other considerations, I would be thankful.",

Assuming each one died with all hands (which is not only not true, but isn't even close to true), that'd be ~12000 dead tankers on both sides.  Across the whole war.  I.e. about a month of total casualties, maybe two.  Once you realize that in actuality maybe half of those tankers died, you can see the issue.\n\nAs another example, if Ukraine got 300 m60s, that'll be enough to completely offset 6-10 months of attrition.  To crew 300 m60, they'll need 1200 men (plus logistics lads, but they won't be going on assaults).  Even if we assumed all of them will die (they won't), that's maybe 1-2 weeks of infantry losses.  To crew 300 tanks.\n\nThere is a logistical argument against archaeotanks.  Maybe a morale one, though the UAF is used to using ancient vehicles.  There is no manpower argument, imo.",
