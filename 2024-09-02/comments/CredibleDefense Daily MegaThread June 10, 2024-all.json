I will post the text (translation with DeepL) and in the comment below this I will provide notes to clarify some parts of the report. My additions in the text are between [square brackets].\n\n>\u2694 The breakthrough near Ocheretyne and the participation of the 115th Brigade\n\n>\ud83d\udccb We have finally managed to gather all the information about the difficult events of April this year. \n\n>The screenshot shows the location of the 115th's defense line. Let's start with the background. The brigade was replacing the 23rd Brigade and the 71st Brigade. The rotation took place on March 27-28, and the brigades left the area on March 29. During January-March, the positions were actively fortified and handed over in fairly good condition, as confirmed by the soldiers of the 115th's various battalions. They were on joint duty for two days, so there is no fault of the predecessors at all. \n\n>\ud83d\udc34 On the right was the 47th Brigade, and on the left was the 23rd Brigade's BTG, which consisted of a hodgepodge of different units, including the dowry units that have been least involved in recent months. That is why they did not go with the main forces of the 23rd. A false thesis was thrown into the media that the 47th was handing over the strip to the 115th and that the enemy broke through the defense during the handover. This is not true, it seems that some officer decided to shift the blame to Magura [47th Brigade] because of his connections.\n\n>\ud83e\udd1d The fighters of the 115th claim that the 47th in the form of Bradley and the 23rd in the form of artillery and mortars constantly helped when the enemy stormed them, but how this happened is unknown, since there was no interaction in other cases. Even within the brigade. As an example, the 1st battalion consistently fired at the 2nd battalion because they thought the enemy was there. Now let's move on to the chronology.\n\n>\u2694\ufe0f The 1st and 3rd battalions started having problems around April 8\ufe0f\u20e3. On the left, at the junction with the 23rd, there was a TRO [TDF unit] on a farm in Novokalynove, commanded by a former MP. This unit fled, endangering the flank of the 3rd battalion. The fighters of the 115th took measures to restore their positions with the support of a tank, which fired 1(!) time. There was no reconnaissance or planning of the assault on the map. As a result, the 7th Company, which carried out these actions, lost many wounded soldiers and lost its combat capability.\n\n>1\ufe0f\u20e31\ufe0f\u20e3 April, the enemy was already in Novokalynove.\n\n>1\ufe0f\u20e32\ufe0f\u20e3 April, in the morning, the Katsaps [Russians] attacked the positions between the Brama and Vidsich railroad tracks with 1 infantry platoon, 2 tanks and 4 armored personnel carriers. The enemy broke through the junction between the 1st and 2nd battalions. Most of the troops were killed or captured. In the evening, the boxes with the assaulters went to the garden society (hereinafter - the ST) and broke through the flank of the 2nd battalion, which was standing above Stepove and did not leave its positions.\n\n>\ud83d\udc74 The fire support companies that were sitting in the ST simply fled or refused to fight, as they consisted of rear units and were of limited use. At the Vydra landmark, 15 enemy units were sitting there all day, and neither artillery nor kamikaze [drones] could do anything to them. The support forces of the 3rd battalion also fled, although the battalion's fighters continued to hold part of Novokalynove until April 20, when they were replaced by the 100th Brigade.\n\n>\ud83d\udc64 At the same time (1\ufe0f\u20e32\ufe0f\u20e3-1\ufe0f\u20e33\ufe0f\u20e3 April), one of the platoon commanders of the 2nd battalion with 5 soldiers went to dig in to stop the breakthrough on their own. Their fate is still unknown. The reconnaissance company moved to the ST in order to somehow remedy the situation, but was completely defeated.\n\n>1\ufe0f\u20e34\ufe0f\u20e3 April, the fa**ot vanguard was at the turn to Novobakhmutivka, so the enemy occupied almost the entire rear of the 2nd battalion. In one of the conversations about the situation to the left of the battalion, the phrase \u201cfuck knows where the first battalion went\u201d was heard.\n\n>1\ufe0f\u20e37\ufe0f\u20e3 - 1\ufe0f\u20e38\ufe0f\u20e3 April, the enemy was already at the [electrical] substation in Ocheretyne and occupied part of the private sector.\n\n>2\ufe0f\u20e32\ufe0f\u20e3 April, the katsaps were already in the high-rise buildings near the [brick] plant and were shooting at cars that tried to drive through the crossing. \n\n>\ud83c\udfda Ocheretyne was not actually defended. The trenches around the village were just a parody and were not suitable for defense. The 115th did not plan to defend it. Of course, the village was visited by scouts from the OTU [Operational-Tactical Group] and stormtroopers of an unknown unit, but for the most part the village was empty. The absence of significant destruction as of April 22 confirms this. The bulk of the artillery strikes have already been carried out by the [Ukrainian] Defense Forces to deter the enemy's advance.\n\n>\ud83e\udd15 Interesting are the figures of losses of one of the battalions, where the number of dead is X and the number of missing persons is 24X [24 times as much].\n\n>\ud83d\udccbConclusion. The fighters of the 115th Brigade on the first line took the fight and tried to save the situation, while a significant number were captured or killed. The brigade's reserves were not ready, there was no interaction, and preparation for combat was also at a low level.\n\n>\ud83d\udd04 As a result, the frontline failed and unjustified losses occurred. There is no fault of the previous units, and minimal fault of the neighbors. The 100th Brigade, which replaced it, also suffered heavy losses in terms of men, because there was no solid strip that a line unit occupies during rotation.\n\n>\ud83c\udfda The entire village of Ocheretyne was lost with minimal fighting, and the defense was not ready, as there was no one to defend it.\n\n>The soldiers of the first line mostly stood to the last. Of course, the brigade could not adequately resist a stronger and more numerous enemy. But at the very least, there should have been interaction, logistics, fire support and no lies in the reports. The soldiers even complained about the lack of food, something that could only be heard over the past year from those who were on the left bank in Krynky, where logistics were really difficult.\n\n>The purpose of this publication is to shed light on those events, showing who is who in this situation. An administrative resource in the form of the brigade's page will not save us, because there must be responsibility for the lives lost so that this never happens again. Neither will the media's attempts to defame the 47th or 23rd. Separately, we are still finalizing a report with complaints from current and former soldiers and will definitely submit it to the Ministry of Defense.\n\n>\u2620\ufe0f It is especially worth considering that this is not the first skeleton in the closet. There was also Severodonetsk, Vodyane and Synkivka. Incompetent and criminal decisions cannot be covered up with dead soldiers, as the brigade media tried to do by attacking our analysts.\n\n>\ud83d\udcca The brigade commander was dismissed in April.

            "body": "Let's begin by clarifying the initial part. The 115th Mechanized Brigade was transferred in late March from the Kupyansk sector to the northern flank of the Avdiivka sector, specifically to the area between Ocheretyne and Novokalynove. [Here](https://i.ibb.co/N1NpSYP/photo-2024-06-05-17-08-26.jpg) is the DS map showing the AOs of the battalions of the 115th Brigade - all of its three mechanized battalions were deployed in the sub-sector. The map highlights their areas of responsibility and in which forest belts their positions were, as well as where the area of jurisdiction of their neighbors began, which matches very well what I knew about these boundaries between brigades (I just thought that the AO of the 47th Mechanized Brigade extended almost to the intersection of the railways). The 115th Brigade replaced the entire 71st Jager Brigade, which was urgently transferred to the southern flank of the Avdiivka sector because of the pressure from the 90th Tank Division from Tonenke in the direction of Umanske (you will remember the huge armored attack of March 30). This brigade originally covered the Novokalynove area. At the same time, the 115th Brigade also replaced a number of battalions of the 23rd Mechanized Brigade, which had been covering the Ocheretyne area since late autumn, and were being withdrawn for R&R. Some elements of the 23rd Brigade (let's recall that other elements of this unit in January had been transferred between Pobjeda and Novomykhailivka in the Marinka sector), consolidated into a battalion tactical group along with other smaller units attached to it, had been moved to the area east of Novokalynove, where the H20 Highway passes. As DeepState confirms, the 23rd and 71st Brigades had done a good job in the previous months, repelling Russian attacks in those directions and fortifying some positions in the area. At the same time, DS reiterates the falsity of the theory that the 115th Brigade had replaced the 47th Brigade, which was never the case.\n\nThe TDF unit mentioned by DS that had been covering the farm south of Novokalynove and accused of fleeing their positions should almost certainly be a company of the 127th Territorial Defense Battalion of the 112th TDF Brigade of the city of Kyiv, led by \n[Nadiya Savchenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadiya_Savchenko). At the same time, I heard that fighters from this unit had alerted the command of the 115th Brigade about the Russian buildup to the south of Novokalynove, but the brigade basically ignored the problem while the positions helf by the TDF were covered by heavy mortar fire. \n\nThe real breakthrough in the direction of Ocheretyne occurred between April 11 and 12. In social media there are dozens of MIA notices of soldiers from the 115th Brigade from these two days alone (though no more than those of soldiers from Russia's 30th Motorized Brigade of the 2nd CAA, which was the unit that carried out the attack). \n\nThe Brama and Vidsich railroad tracks are the Avdiivka-Pokrovsk and the Ocheretyne-Horlivka railways, and a garden society is located within their junction. The emoticon in the paragraph about the substantial uselessness of the brigade's support units explains the main reason for this.\n\nAround April 20, the 100th Mechanized Brigade (formerly the 100th TDF Brigade), urgently transferred from the Serebrianka Forest, arrived (supported by other smaller units) in order to replace the 115th Brigade, which had lost its combat capability; the 100th Brigade suffered heavy casualties but pretty much was able to stem the Russian momentum.\n\nI think the text already makes abundantly clear the coordination problems between the battalions of the 115th Brigade, as well as the serious negligence of the command, which was fortunately relieved. One certainly cannot belittle the heroism of the majority of the infantrymen of the 115th Brigade, who did their utmost duty, often paying the dearest price; although there were, by a minority of servicemen, episodes of unjustified abandonment of positions and refusal of combat duties. \n\nThe final part mentions the other negative episodes that occurred in the past due to the responsibility of the 115th Brigade, which I will clarify. In May 2022 the 115th Mechanized Brigade had just recently been created and was sent to Severodonetsk. Its servicemen did not fortify their area of responsibility (i.e. the forest near the Hotel Mir) and did not dig in, despite having had two weeks to do so, abandoning their positions when the Russians reached them. With the result that the latters seized the hotel and started pouring into the city, which after the loss of the forest was surrounded on three sides, with very negative consequences for their neighboring units. Criminal cases for desertion were opened against dozens of servicemen of the 115th Brigade. \n\nIn October 2022 it was covering the southern flank of Avdiivka. Their negligence resulted in the loss of Vodyane and Opytne. I had heard some time ago about an instance where soldiers of the 115th Brigade knew they were going to be replaced (by the 36th Marine Brigade) and some positions were abandoned unilaterally, without communicating anything to the newly arrived unit. When the marines arrived at those positions, they discovered that they had already been occupied by the Russians. The 36th Brigade (just arrived from Kherson), especially its 501st Battalion, had to work hard to stabilize the negative consequences, that had provided opportunities to advance to the Russians.\n\nThe last problem occured - fortunately the one with the least negative consequences - was the loss of ground in the forest south of Lyman Pershyi (and to the north-west of Synkivka, in the Kupyansk sector) between November and December 2023, which allowed the Russians to occupy several positions near the settlement of Synkivka, which were then used as staging points for the assault on the village. In this case unsuccessfully for the Russians, as other brigades managed to repel the Russian attacks and to drive them out of the northern outskirts of Synkivka, with very heavy losses for the Russians (with the command of the 6th CAA and its subordinate brigades getting replaced).",

One certainly cannot belittle the heroism of the majority of the infantrymen of the 115th Brigade, who did their utmost duty, often paying the dearest price; although there were, by a minority of servicemen, episodes of unjustified abandonment of positions and refusal of combat duties. </p>\n\n<p>The final part mentions the other negative episodes that occurred in the past due to the responsibility of the 115th Brigade, which I will clarify. In May 2022 the 115th Mechanized Brigade had just recently been created and was sent to Severodonetsk. Its servicemen did not fortify their area of responsibility (i.e. the forest near the Hotel Mir) and did not dig in, despite having had two weeks to do so, abandoning their positions when the Russians reached them. With the result that the latters seized the hotel and started pouring into the city, which after the loss of the forest was surrounded on three sides, with very negative consequences for their neighboring units. Criminal cases for desertion were opened against dozens of servicemen of the 115th Brigade. </p>\n\n<p>In October 2022 it was covering the southern flank of Avdiivka. Their negligence resulted in the loss of Vodyane and Opytne. I had heard some time ago about an instance where soldiers of the 115th Brigade knew they were going to be replaced (by the 36th Marine Brigade) and some positions were abandoned unilaterally, without communicating anything to the newly arrived unit. When the marines arrived at those positions, they discovered that they had already been occupied by the Russians. The 36th Brigade (just arrived from Kherson), especially its 501st Battalion, had to work hard to stabilize the negative consequences, that had provided opportunities to advance to the Russians.</p>\n\n<p>The last problem occured - fortunately the one with the least negative consequences - was the loss of ground in the forest south of Lyman Pershyi (and to the north-west of Synkivka, in the Kupyansk sector) between November and December 2023, which allowed the Russians to occupy several positions near the settlement of Synkivka, which were then used as staging points for the assault on the village. In this case unsuccessfully for the Russians, as other brigades managed to repel the Russian attacks and to drive them out of the northern outskirts of Synkivka, with very heavy losses for the Russians (with the command of the 6th CAA and its subordinate brigades getting replaced).</p>\n</div>",

                "body": "There are several reasons. First this thins out Russias air defense. Normally air defense systems are set up to overlap, if Russia looses more of these long range systems they may not be able to do that, or at least will need to reduce the degree of system overlap. Meaning the destruction of a single system could leave gaps in coverage that could be exploited by F16s at high altitude. This is critical as it would allow Ukraine to more effectively use many of their stand-off munitions, in particular JDAM-ER. This does not need to be in support of a strategic level offensive but could be used to simply stop an enemy offensive or to conduct a limited counter attack. This last point is critical as at the moment Ukraine lacks the ability to conduct even small local counterattacks, and most if not all Russian gains are quickly fortified and cemented. \n\nThe second major reason this is useful is it creates holes for strike drones to exploit. Even a small decrease in Russias defense capability will translate to a large increase in penetration by stoke drones as Ukraine can target those areas. \n\nThe last is simply over the course of a long war these attrition rates add up. 2 more years of strikes at the current rate will basically eliminate Russias air defense capability. Obviously that won\u2019t happen as the Russians will respond by changing tactics and dispersing forces. But that inevitably means Russia will be putting these systems in less efficient and effective positions, allowing Ukraine to operate with a greater degree of flexibility.

Normally air defense systems are set up to overlap, if Russia looses more of these long range systems they may not be able to do that, or at least will need to reduce the degree of system overlap. Meaning the destruction of a single system could leave gaps in coverage that could be exploited by F16s at high altitude. This is critical as it would allow Ukraine to more effectively use many of their stand-off munitions, in particular JDAM-ER. This does not need to be in support of a strategic level offensive but could be used to simply stop an enemy offensive or to conduct a limited counter attack. This last point is critical as at the moment Ukraine lacks the ability to conduct even small local counterattacks, and most if not all Russian gains are quickly fortified and cemented. </p>\n\n<p>The second major reason this is useful is it creates holes for strike drones to exploit. Even a small decrease in Russias defense capability will translate to a large increase in penetration by stoke drones as Ukraine can target those areas. </p>\n\n<p>The last is simply over the course of a long war these attrition rates add up. 2 more years of strikes at the current rate will basically eliminate Russias air defense capability. Obviously that won\u2019t happen as the Russians will respond by changing tactics and dispersing forces. But that inevitably means Russia will be putting these systems in less efficient and effective positions, allowing Ukraine to operate with a greater degree of flexibility. In short this campaign imposes a dilemma on the Russians that isn\u2019t easily resolved.</p>\n</div>",

According to these figures, 78 thousand people had been part of PMC Wagner since the beginning of the invasion, including 49 thousand convicts. The latter have had 15 thousand KIAs and 25 thousand WIAs. Per Prigozhin's statements, PMC Wagner had 22 thousand KIAs and 40 thousand WIAs as of the day of the capture of Bakhmut (May 20, 2023). Accordingly, the non-convict Wagnerites had 7 thousand KIAs and 15 thousand WIAs. Let's recall that the memorial dedicated to the Wagnerites fallen in action contains \u201cover 25 thousand names\u201d according to Grey Zone, although it probably includes those who fell in Syria, Africa as well as those from the campaigns in Ukraine prior to Bakhmut (i.e. Popasna and Svitlodarsk).\n\nHowever, if we recall that: the 106th VDV Division played an important role in the capture of Soledar and Opytne in January 2023 and in general there was support and even direct action by some regular units of the RuAF (which thus had casualties); the outer flanks were held by units of the 2nd Corps; in early May several regular units arrived to replace PMC Wagner on the flanks (such as much of the 3rd Corps, the 200th Motorized Brigade of the 14th Corps, the 9th Motorized Regiment of the 18th Motorized Division of the 11th Corps, regiments of the Territorial Forces etc), I consider it very likely that the Russians may have had more than 25 thousand KIAs + MIAs from early August (when the first attacks on Soledar began) to late May (withdrawal of PMC Wagner from the Bakhmut sector), probably even close to 30 thousand (considering the wider sector, thus including Soledar).\n\nIn general, I am surprised at the seemingly great reliability (compared to the statements by Wagner's sources) of the BBC/Mediazona findings on the figure of convicts killed in action, although I think the figure regarding non-convict Wagnerites is underestimated (the latters, as the graph in the article you linked shows well, had the highest losses in the last month of the battle, i.e. in its urban phase, as the convicts were basically gone since Wagner could no longer recruit them since February 2023, and in general urban combat requires higher skills to be successful).\n\nIt should also be said that if several capable and well-trained Ukrainian brigades lost combat capabilities in Bakhmut and Soledar, there was also a very widespread employment of elements of numerous TDF brigades and in general, unfortunately, of really poorly trained personnel (which makes me skeptical of such a favorable ratio, although I think it was still largely in Ukraine's favor), while the personnel undergoing more serious training, particularly during the second part of the battle, were kept in the rear in preparation for the counteroffensive. At the same time, I think Russia's use of convicts was a success (arguably one of their biggest successes of this war) - there were so many things that could have gone wrong, and instead things generally went in their favor (although we will never know the amount of harsh discipline this required and how many countless convicts were killed on the spot as a result of violations, etc).

If you're just looking at raw signal strength though then it's incredibly easy. [This paper](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/brochure/75016740.pdf) provides a quick overview of the signal. GPS sats have a transmit power of approx 50W and they're 20k km away, you can easily exceed this locally with something powered by a hamster wheel (~1W). The point of this is to say that looking strictly at spectral power is a bad metric.\n\nEdit: \n\n>Can you buy such an emitter on amazon or alibaba?\n\nYes easily, a [guy was arrested recently](https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/n-j-man-in-a-jam-after-illegal-gps-device-interferes-with-newark-liberty-operations/) for jamming GPS at Newark airport with a device he bought online for about 100 bucks. It was in his truck and probably powered through the cigarette lighter/usb connection and therefore not high power at all.

Azov has always been an explicitly anti-Russian unit, and was literally formed to fight against the Donbass separatists. I'm assuming you don't have a source, because that's an insanely bizarre claim to make. Azov has been around since 2014, and in between 2014 and the start of the Russian invasion, they were rather widely known to be, at best, very far right and very well connected in neo-nazi circles. I apologize if this comment is rather long, but I happen to have a great deal of personal knowledge about these groups through a music scene I used to be very involved in.\n\n\n\u00a0They recruited volunteers at NSBM (National Socialist Black Metal) concerts (most notably, Asgardrei, which was ran with the assistance of Denis Nikitin aka White Rex, who now leads the far-right Russian defector/Ukrainian aligned unit called the \"Russian Volunteer Corps\" but used to organize MMA fights and lead a band called Adolfkvlt. Interestingly, he has also apparently hosted a podcast with exiled American neo-nazi Robert Rundo, who ran a street fighting organization that participated in the Charlottesville white nationalist rally. My first exposure to White Rex and Asgardrei came from my involvement in the black metal music scene, where Asgardrei is infamous as the largest public NSBM festival in the world, featuring extremist bands including Goatmoon, Absurd, and M8l8th.\n\n\nThis includes a record label, Militant Zone, which used to sell records dedicated to Hitler and proudly touts, on it's website, pictures of Azov Battalion, a shirt dedicated to Azovstahl (that donates money directly to Azov Battalion) alongside shirts dedicated to William Luther Pierce featuring white-hooded men talking about the \"Day of the Rope\" a shirt with skeletal soldiers in WW2 German uniforms, a shirt depicting SA streetfighters with the caption \"Troublemakers 1933 Militant Youth\" and a shirt that has a picture of Hitler on it without his mustache.\u00a0\n\n\nHowever, Azov also has plenty of international connections, in addition to the Russians in the Russian Volunteer Corp. Militant Zone is closely associated with the \"Misanthropic Division,\" a Ukrainian Nazi organization that is connected to the Italian Casapound movement, the American accelerationist terrorist organization Atomwaffen Division, and I kid you not, the neo-nazi Satanist cult Order of Nine Angles, which is an insane rabbit hole in itself, and numerous other international far right organizations. At Asgardrei, they conducted literal rituals dedicated to Hitler on the \"Fuhrernacht\" as recently as 2019.\n\n\nThe Sparta Battalion is also far right, as were many of the people involved in Wagner, the name and tattoos tend to give this away, but neo-nazis do not automatically get along, because Russian extreme nationalism and Ukrainian extreme nationalism tend to be diameteically opposed. Azov may very well have cleaned up, I imagine the war has caused them to priorize combat effective soldiers over ideological radicals, but their history as a Neo-Nazi organization is very well documented, and their history of close connections and collaborations with the international neo-nazi underground are numerous and also well documented. They have, or at least had, Russian members, but they were almost certainly ideological volunteers like Nivikin, or the Scandinavian neo-nazi organization Nordic Resistance Movement, who (before the war at least) encouraged members to join Azov to gain military training and firearms experience.",

I would say Ka is better for the application, but that's just because of frequency. Both are going to still be significantly attenuated by the plasma sheath, which is going to make targeting harder. Even in higher frequencies attenuation does still occur, it's just not totally opaque. Ballistic missiles are just fine for static targets, the whole point of hypersonic maneuver is to evade defenses and hit dynamic targets. That requires a really good radar lock, which in turn is going to require deceleration. There's a reason it was a big hullaballoo in the press when Chinese scientists published a method of reliable satcom with a hypersonic vehicle. It's a hard problem to solve, harder still when your enemy is jamming or using EW.\n\n>Which does not invalidate my point that terminal radar guidance for hypersonic re-entry is not just entirely possible but has been demonstrated in reality.\n\n...yes it does. That's what deceleration does, it stops plasma accumulation and allows the compressed air to dissipate faster than it accumulates. Of course you can put a radar on something that doesn't have to contend with a plasma sheath, that's not a controversial position. If your position is that a hypersonic vehicle can slow down and use a radar, then we have no disagreement.\n\nYou're correct about DSMAC, with the caveat that hypersonic maneuvering can greatly increase the opacity of the plasma sheath for periods of time. Makes it much harder to maintain a solid lock when the radar return is lost for a time. Solvable, but not trivial.",

Even in higher frequencies attenuation does still occur, it&#39;s just not totally opaque. Ballistic missiles are just fine for static targets, the whole point of hypersonic maneuver is to evade defenses and hit dynamic targets. That requires a really good radar lock, which in turn is going to require deceleration. There&#39;s a reason it was a big hullaballoo in the press when Chinese scientists published a method of reliable satcom with a hypersonic vehicle. It&#39;s a hard problem to solve, harder still when your enemy is jamming or using EW.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Which does not invalidate my point that terminal radar guidance for hypersonic re-entry is not just entirely possible but has been demonstrated in reality.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>...yes it does. That&#39;s what deceleration does, it stops plasma accumulation and allows the compressed air to dissipate faster than it accumulates. Of course you can put a radar on something that doesn&#39;t have to contend with a plasma sheath, that&#39;s not a controversial position. If your position is that a hypersonic vehicle can slow down and use a radar, then we have no disagreement.</p>\n\n<p>You&#39;re correct about DSMAC, with the caveat that hypersonic maneuvering can greatly increase the opacity of the plasma sheath for periods of time. Makes it much harder to maintain a solid lock when the radar return is lost for a time. Solvable, but not trivial.</p>\n</div>",

In the latter blackout is usually not an issue, and even for orbital entries, blackout is fairly easily mitigated. It is more or less a myth that Blackout is this magical blanket that disallows any kind of communication with ground control. There are workarounds (communicating sideways/to the back to a relay satellite; putting antennas in locations where the electron density is lower/using frequencies above the cutoff frequency).\n\nEDIT: Here is the 1965 Gemini 2 video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccDGH7ZYQsE",
            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>There are plenty of videos of atmospheric entries, dating back to the 60&#39;s:</p>\n\n<p>Artemis 1\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L58pWzCsR5I\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L58pWzCsR5I</a></p>\n\n<p>Orion\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7CL4GEdaWo\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7CL4GEdaWo</a></p>\n\n<p>Space Shuttle\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAaMuTRGP6k\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAaMuTRGP6k</a></p>\n\n<p>Varda Capsule\n<a href=\"https://www.universetoday.com/165935/watch-the-varda-capsules-entire-fiery-atmospheric-re-entry\">https://www.universetoday.com/165935/watch-the-varda-capsules-entire-fiery-atmospheric-re-entry</a></p>\n\n<p>(I cannot find the video from the 60&#39;s, it was the Gemini mission IIRC)</p>\n\n<p>But to answer your question, the flight regime of these spacecrafts (up to 7km/s) is the so-called orbital hypersonic regime, which is usually higher than the one from lower altitude Hypersonic missiles. In the latter blackout is usually not an issue, and even for orbital entries, blackout is fairly easily mitigated. It is more or less a myth that Blackout is this magical blanket that disallows any kind of communication with ground control.

        "body": "If Ukraine is reliably hitting S300-400 systems, I think that might mark a turning point in the war. My main hypothesis is that Ukraine wins the war for Ukraine in the air over Ukraine. Not via artillery, not by taking ground, and not by killing attacking Russians. \n\nOf course, turning points are only visible looking back, they are not visible in the moment. \n\nHere is my argument, Russia is very strong at ground warfare. They quickly build railroads for supply, have plenty of trucks, plenty of artillery, a huge amount of tanks and armor for infantry, and a huge amount of mines. In this respect, Russia dwarfs NATO and Europe in terms of ground equipment. Even if Ukraine is able to destroy all of Russia's back-stock of tanks and IFVs, they can still make new ones that may not support an invasion, but would support a low-intensity defensive war by Russia. \n\nHowever, Russia's big weakness is in the air. They have good, 4th generation fighter jets, but they lack the numbers and the capability of NATO jets. This was evident very early on during the war when Russia failed to destroy Ukraine's air defense systems and their aircraft were shot down. Essentially, Russia never developed SEAD capability to conduct air operations at high altitude over the line of contact. \n\nRussia has made up with this shortfall by having good, ground based air defense systems. The backbone being the S300/400 systems that have long range attack capability. That gives Russia the ability to deny the enemy the ability to operate over large areas at high altitude, specifically over the line of contact. That's important, because the line of contact for Ukraine is 600 miles, and it can be covered with essentially 3-5 S300/400 systems. Smaller systems, such as the Buk, are more effective at close range, but don't have the area denial capability and would struggle against Ukrainian SEAD capability (they have already demonstrated using the HARM-88 and ATACMS).\n\nThe S300/400 systems allow Russia to ping away constantly with the radar and detect any aircraft coming in (with holes obviously - we saw that with the drones being able to exploit those holes). But they are very effective at stopping high-altitude operations. \n\nWith the S300/400 systems being knocked out, it means Russia will have to change tactics. Their air defense will have a lot more holes. Essentially, Russia won't be able to ping away constantly, because if they did, a HARM-88 will be headed their way (or ATACMS, which might be what we are seeing now). So they have to use more sophisticated air defense tactics such as turn on and off their radars and move their air defense systems. What that means is that Russia's air defense is seriously weakened, and Ukraine can exploit it with drones. \n\nRussia does have fighters and AWACs to shoot at Ukrainian NATO aircraft. All of that said, NATO has many more jets than Russia does and better missiles. So over time, Ukraine would win that duel. Not right away, but over the course of a year or two. \n\nHere is how it looks to me over the next coming years. Russia continues to lose air defense systems at a high rate, slowly degrading the air defense force. Ukraine continues to get more sophisticated air assets such as F16s, Mirage 2000s, AWACs, helicopters, etc. Slowly, Ukraine starts to take control of the skies of the line of contact to the point of where Russia can no longer operate on the ground at the line of contact without being bombed from high altitude (not glide bombs). Either a TB2 or F16s with laser guided bombs. At that point, Ukraine would be able to bypass Russian ground lines of defense by suppressing them (from high altitude) and by simply flying over them.",

Will this happen in Ukraine? No likely not. But if Ukraine could gain operation flexibility in the air it would enable them to be far more successful in a myriad of other areas.</p>\n</div>",
