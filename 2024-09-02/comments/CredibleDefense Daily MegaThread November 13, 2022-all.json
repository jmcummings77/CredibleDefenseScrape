I haven\u2019t heard it from anyone on Reddit, on Twitter, from either of the parties, or even any fringe candidates from either Dem side or Republicans.\n\nWhat I do know is that trade between China and the U.S. was $559 billion in 2020. China and the U.S. have real business, and are not concerned with what poor people who fight wars with peasant armies wearing footwraps post about on Russian telegram - no one cares. \n\nThe United States is 98% not basing Chinese semiconductor policy on Russia, Russia is already sanctioned, and that 2% is making sure Russia stays in the 70-80s militarily in terms of semiconductors, while HIMARS/Excalibur/Javelins/NLAWS zaps Russians from afar. My guess is Russians are trying to elbow their way into a discussion they are not a part of based on pure narcissism here, the U.S. Senate, House, and Presidency did not base semiconductor policy upon what Italy is doing (Russia has the same GDP as Italy).

Again, not saying you are bringing that claim from Russian telegram, just pointing out the obvious.\n\nNo, the real take here from most people, including Americans from the right and left, is that China has a vested interest in keeping business with the U.S. To do that, that means abandoning Russia, but that Xi has taken the extra step of humiliating Putin at every turn during this war is surprising. Whether Russians understand that is no consequence.\n\nBTW the abandonment is just the start, nevermind Xi being a complete dick about the whole thing, like having Putin kiss his ring to his face in Shanghai, and nevermind Chinese sources floating public talking points about how Putin and Xi were never on the same page in western media.\n\nNow they are just completely dunking on Russia.\n\nThe surprise is not the abandonment of Russia, its probably the way China is treating Russia publicly about the whole thing.

I haven\u2019t heard it from anyone on Reddit, on Twitter, from either of the parties, or even any fringe candidates from either Dem side or Republicans.</p>\n\n<p>What I do know is that trade between China and the U.S. was $559 billion in 2020. China and the U.S. have real business, and are not concerned with what poor people who fight wars with peasant armies wearing footwraps post about on Russian telegram - no one cares. </p>\n\n<p>The United States is 98% not basing Chinese semiconductor policy on Russia, Russia is already sanctioned, and that 2% is making sure Russia stays in the 70-80s militarily in terms of semiconductors, while HIMARS/Excalibur/Javelins/NLAWS zaps Russians from afar. My guess is Russians are trying to elbow their way into a discussion they are not a part of based on pure narcissism here, the U.S. Senate, House, and Presidency did not base semiconductor policy upon what Italy is doing (Russia has the same GDP as Italy).

The United Arab Emirates steered U.S. foreign policy in its favor through a series of legal and illegal exploits, according to an unprecedented U.S. intelligence document*\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/11/12/uae-meddled-us-politics-intel-report/?\n\nThe activities covered in the report, described to The Washington Post by three people who have read it, include illegal and legal attempts to steer U.S. foreign policy in ways favorable to the Arab autocracy. It reveals the UAE\u2019s bid, spanning multiple U.S. administrations, to exploit the vulnerabilities in American governance, including its reliance on campaign contributions, susceptibility to powerful lobbying firms and lax enforcement of disclosure laws intended to guard against interference by foreign governments, these people said. Each spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss classified information.\n\nThe document was compiled by the National Intelligence Council and briefed to top U.S. policymakers in recent weeks to guide their decision-making related to the Middle East and the UAE, which enjoys outsize influence in Washington. The report is remarkable in that it focuses on the influence operations of a friendly nation rather than an adversarial power such as Russia, China or Iran. It is also uncommon for a U.S. intelligence product to closely examine interactions involving U.S. officials given its mandate to focus on foreign threats.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. intelligence community generally stays clear of anything that could be interpreted as studying American domestic politics,\u201d said Bruce Riedel, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who served on the National Intelligence Council in the 1990s.\n\n\u201cDoing something like this on a friendly power is also unique. It\u2019s a sign that the U.S. intelligence community is willing to take on new challenges,\u201d he said.\n\nLauren Frost, a spokeswoman at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, declined to comment when asked about the report.\n\nThe UAE\u2019s ambassador to Washington, Yousef Al Otaiba, said he is \u201cproud of the UAE\u2019s influence and good standing in the U.S.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has been hard earned and well deserved. It is the product of decades of close UAE-US cooperation and effective diplomacy. It reflects common interests and shared values,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nThe relationship is unique. Over the years, the United States has agreed to sell the UAE some of its most sophisticated and lethal military equipment, including MQ-9 aerial drones and advanced F-35 fighter jets, a privilege not bestowed on any other Arab country over concern about diminishing Israel\u2019s qualitative military edge.\n\nSome of the influence operations described in the report are known to national security professionals, but such activities have flourished due to Washington\u2019s unwillingness to reform foreign-influence laws or provide additional resources to the Department of Justice. Other activities more closely resemble espionage, people familiar with the report said.\n\nThe UAE has spent more than $154 million on lobbyists since 2016, according to Justice Department records. It has spent hundreds of millions of dollars more on donations to American universities and think tanks, many that produce policy papers with findings favorable to UAE interests.\n\nThere is no prohibition in the United States on lobbyists donating money to political campaigns. One U.S. lawmaker who read the intelligence report told The Post that it illustrates how American democracy is being distorted by foreign money, saying it should serve as a wake-up call.\n\n\u201cA very clear red line needs to be established against the UAE playing in American politics,\u201d said the lawmaker. \u201cI\u2019m not convinced we\u2019ve ever raised this with the Emiratis at a high level.\u201d\n\nInvestigation: Mattis and others guided the UAE as it intervened in regional civil wars and U.S. politics\n\nBoth the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the State Department declined to comment on whether they have addressed the issue with senior UAE counterparts.\n\nThe U.S. government\u2019s muted public response follows President Biden\u2019s impassioned pitch to midterm elections voters last week that American democracy is under threat from powerful interests and needs concerted safeguarding. \u201cWith democracy on the ballot, we have to remember these first principles: Democracy means the rule of the people \u2014 not the rule of monarchs or the moneyed, but the rule of the people,\u201d Biden said during a speech in Washington.\n\nThe National Intelligence Council, or NIC, is the intelligence community\u2019s premier analytic hub. Its products draw on information from the nation\u2019s 18 intelligence agencies to speak with one voice on pressing national security issues.\n\nPeople who shared information about the report declined to provide a copy of it. They said the activities attributed to the UAE in the report go well beyond mere influence peddling.\n\nOne of the more brazen exploits involved the hiring of three former U.S. intelligence and military officials to help the UAE surveil dissidents, politicians, journalists and U.S. companies. In public legal filings, U.S. prosecutors said the men helped the UAE break into computers in the United States and other countries. Last year, all three admitted in court to providing sophisticated hacking technology to the UAE, agreeing to surrender their security clearances and pay about $1.7 million to resolve criminal charges. The Justice Department touted the settlement as a \u201cfirst-of-its-kind resolution.\u201d\n\nIt did not involve prison time, however, and critics viewed the financial penalty as paltry given the substantial payments received by the former U.S. officials for their work, raising concerns it did little to dissuade similar future behavior.\n\nBiden vows expanded U.S. role in Mideast as controversial trip ends\n\nThose seeking reform also note the federal trial of Thomas Barrack, a longtime adviser to former president Donald Trump, who was acquitted this month of charges alleging he worked as an agent of the UAE and lied to federal investigators about it.",

            "body": "U.S. prosecutors accused Barrack of exploiting his access to Trump to benefit the UAE and working a secret back channel for communications that involved passing sensitive information to Emirati officials. The evidence introduced in court included thousands of messages, social media posts and flight records, as well as communications showing that Emirati officials provided him with talking points for media appearances in which he praised the UAE. After one such interview, Barrack emailed a contact saying, \u201cI nailed it \u2026 for the home team,\u201d referring to the UAE.\n\nBarrack, who never registered with the U.S. government to lobby for the gulf state, vehemently denied the charges, and prosecutors failed to convince a jury that his influence-peddling gave rise to crimes. An assistant of his, Matthew Grimes, was also acquitted. Barrack, though a spokesman, declined to comment.\n\nThe UAE is far from alone in using aggressive tactics to try to bend the U.S. political system to its liking. Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Israel, Taiwan and scores of other governments run influence campaigns in the United States in an effort to impact U.S. policy.\n\nBut the intelligence community\u2019s scrutiny of the UAE indicates a heightened level of concern and a dramatic departure from the laudatory way the country is discussed in public by U.S. secretaries of state and defense and presidents, who routinely emphasize the \u201cimportance of further deepening the U.S.-UAE strategic relationship.\u201d\n\nThe UAE is a federation of sheikhdoms with more than 9 million people including the city-states of Abu Dhabi and Dubai.\n\nSince 2012, it has been the third-biggest purchaser of U.S. weapons and built what many consider the most powerful military in the Arab world by cultivating close ties to the U.S. political, defense and military establishment.\n\nThe UAE\u2019s armed forces have fought alongside U.S. troops in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. The country also hosts 5,000 U.S. military personnel at al-Dhafra Air Base and U.S. warships at the Jebel Ali deep-water port.\n\nBoosters of the gulf state in U.S. think tanks and military circles often hail it as \u201cLittle Sparta\u201d for its military prowess while sidestepping its human rights record and ironclad kinship with Saudi Arabia.\n\nThere are no elections or political parties in the UAE, and no independent judiciary. Criticism of the government is banned, and trade unions and homosexuality are outlawed. Freedom House ranks the gulf state among the least free countries in the world.\n\nA princess raced to escape Dubai\u2019s powerful ruler. Then her phone appeared on the list.\n\nThe stifling political environment stands in stark contrast to the country\u2019s opulent cosmopolitan offerings, including the world\u2019s tallest building, ski slopes inside a shopping mall and Ferrari World, a theme park inspired by the Italian sports car manufacturer. Its largest city, Dubai, is a tax-free business hub with glitzy five-star hotels, nightclubs and DJ concerts that feel incongruous to the nearby religious zeal of Saudi Arabia. In recent years, U.S. officials and independent watchdogs have warned that smuggling and money-laundering in the UAE have allowed criminals and militants to hide their wealth there.\n\nFocus on the UAE\u2019s role in Washington grew following the death of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey. The CIA concluded his killing was done at the behest of Saudi Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman, a revelation that caused Washington lobbying firms and think tanks to sever their financial ties to Riyadh. Though the UAE had no involvement, the crown prince\u2019s status as a protege of Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the ruler of the United Arab Emirates known as MBZ, invited greater scrutiny.\n\n\u201cMBZ was a big part of the crowd who said the Saudi crown prince would be a reformer, make Saudi Arabia a more normal country, give women the right to vote \u2014 all of which crashed when Khashoggi was killed,\u201d Riedel said.\n\nUAE agency put spyware on phone of Khashoggi\u2019s wife months before his murder, forensics show\n\nConcerns about the UAE among human rights groups grew with its military involvement in the brutal war in Yemen, from which it has since withdrawn. The gulf state also angered U.S. officials after the Defense Department\u2019s watchdog said the UAE may have been financing the Wagner Group, a Russian mercenary army close to the Kremlin that has been accused of atrocities in Libya, Ukraine and Africa. The UAE denies the charge.\n\nThough the UAE has maintained strong bipartisan support in the United States, it cultivated a particularly close connection to the Trump administration, which approved the $23 billion sale of F-35s, MQ-9s and other munitions to the gulf state. The transfer, which has faced resistance by congressional Democrats, has not moved forward yet but is supported by the Biden administration.\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump shakes hands with Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in the White House. (Andrew Harnik/AP)\nLast month, The Post revealed the UAE\u2019s extensive courtship of retired high-ranking U.S. military personnel. The investigation showed that over the past seven years, 280 retired U.S. service members have worked as military contractors and consultants for the UAE, more than for any other country, and that the advisory jobs pay handsomely.\n\nInstrumental to the UAE\u2019s success in Washington has been Otaiba, an ambassador who has forged strong connections with powerful politicians and business leaders across the political spectrum.\n\nThe intelligence report is careful not to identify specific individuals, according to people who have read it, but it mentions several meetings and conversations involving U.S. and Emirati officials. One passage refers to a meeting of a senior U.S. and senior UAE official who commended each other for \u201csingle-handedly\u201d salvaging the U.S.-UAE relationship.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>U.S. prosecutors accused Barrack of exploiting his access to Trump to benefit the UAE and working a secret back channel for communications that involved passing sensitive information to Emirati officials. The evidence introduced in court included thousands of messages, social media posts and flight records, as well as communications showing that Emirati officials provided him with talking points for media appearances in which he praised the UAE. After one such interview, Barrack emailed a contact saying, \u201cI nailed it \u2026 for the home team,\u201d referring to the UAE.</p>\n\n<p>Barrack, who never registered with the U.S. government to lobby for the gulf state, vehemently denied the charges, and prosecutors failed to convince a jury that his influence-peddling gave rise to crimes. An assistant of his, Matthew Grimes, was also acquitted. Barrack, though a spokesman, declined to comment.</p>\n\n<p>The UAE is far from alone in using aggressive tactics to try to bend the U.S. political system to its liking. Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Israel, Taiwan and scores of other governments run influence campaigns in the United States in an effort to impact U.S. policy.</p>\n\n<p>But the intelligence community\u2019s scrutiny of the UAE indicates a heightened level of concern and a dramatic departure from the laudatory way the country is discussed in public by U.S. secretaries of state and defense and presidents, who routinely emphasize the \u201cimportance of further deepening the U.S.-UAE strategic relationship.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The UAE is a federation of sheikhdoms with more than 9 million people including the city-states of Abu Dhabi and Dubai.</p>\n\n<p>Since 2012, it has been the third-biggest purchaser of U.S. weapons and built what many consider the most powerful military in the Arab world by cultivating close ties to the U.S. political, defense and military establishment.</p>\n\n<p>The UAE\u2019s armed forces have fought alongside U.S. troops in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. The country also hosts 5,000 U.S. military personnel at al-Dhafra Air Base and U.S. warships at the Jebel Ali deep-water port.</p>\n\n<p>Boosters of the gulf state in U.S. think tanks and military circles often hail it as \u201cLittle Sparta\u201d for its military prowess while sidestepping its human rights record and ironclad kinship with Saudi Arabia.</p>\n\n<p>There are no elections or political parties in the UAE, and no independent judiciary. Criticism of the government is banned, and trade unions and homosexuality are outlawed. Freedom House ranks the gulf state among the least free countries in the world.</p>\n\n<p>A princess raced to escape Dubai\u2019s powerful ruler. Then her phone appeared on the list.</p>\n\n<p>The stifling political environment stands in stark contrast to the country\u2019s opulent cosmopolitan offerings, including the world\u2019s tallest building, ski slopes inside a shopping mall and Ferrari World, a theme park inspired by the Italian sports car manufacturer. Its largest city, Dubai, is a tax-free business hub with glitzy five-star hotels, nightclubs and DJ concerts that feel incongruous to the nearby religious zeal of Saudi Arabia. In recent years, U.S. officials and independent watchdogs have warned that smuggling and money-laundering in the UAE have allowed criminals and militants to hide their wealth there.</p>\n\n<p>Focus on the UAE\u2019s role in Washington grew following the death of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey. The CIA concluded his killing was done at the behest of Saudi Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman, a revelation that caused Washington lobbying firms and think tanks to sever their financial ties to Riyadh. Though the UAE had no involvement, the crown prince\u2019s status as a protege of Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the ruler of the United Arab Emirates known as MBZ, invited greater scrutiny.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMBZ was a big part of the crowd who said the Saudi crown prince would be a reformer, make Saudi Arabia a more normal country, give women the right to vote \u2014 all of which crashed when Khashoggi was killed,\u201d Riedel said.</p>\n\n<p>UAE agency put spyware on phone of Khashoggi\u2019s wife months before his murder, forensics show</p>\n\n<p>Concerns about the UAE among human rights groups grew with its military involvement in the brutal war in Yemen, from which it has since withdrawn. The gulf state also angered U.S. officials after the Defense Department\u2019s watchdog said the UAE may have been financing the Wagner Group, a Russian mercenary army close to the Kremlin that has been accused of atrocities in Libya, Ukraine and Africa. The UAE denies the charge.</p>\n\n<p>Though the UAE has maintained strong bipartisan support in the United States, it cultivated a particularly close connection to the Trump administration, which approved the $23 billion sale of F-35s, MQ-9s and other munitions to the gulf state. The transfer, which has faced resistance by congressional Democrats, has not moved forward yet but is supported by the Biden administration.</p>\n\n<p>President Donald Trump shakes hands with Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in the White House. (Andrew Harnik/AP)\nLast month, The Post revealed the UAE\u2019s extensive courtship of retired high-ranking U.S. military personnel. The investigation showed that over the past seven years, 280 retired U.S. service members have worked as military contractors and consultants for the UAE, more than for any other country, and that the advisory jobs pay handsomely.</p>\n\n<p>Instrumental to the UAE\u2019s success in Washington has been Otaiba, an ambassador who has forged strong connections with powerful politicians and business leaders across the political spectrum.</p>\n\n<p>The intelligence report is careful not to identify specific individuals, according to people who have read it, but it mentions several meetings and conversations involving U.S. and Emirati officials. One passage refers to a meeting of a senior U.S. and senior UAE official who commended each other for \u201csingle-handedly\u201d salvaging the U.S.-UAE relationship. One person who read the report said it was an unmistakable reference to Otaiba.</p>\n\n<p>When asked about the intelligence community\u2019s findings, Otaiba said he has been \u201chonored to be among a group of serious people with good intentions in both countries that have built a full and lasting partnership that has made the UAE, the U.S. and the region more secure, more prosperous, and more open-minded.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Some U.S. lawmakers in both parties have proposed legislation to curb foreign influence in U.S. politics.

By July it could claim to have captured the last city in Luhansk, though Ukraine has gained some ground in the area in recent weeks. In Donetsk, by contrast, Moscow has made little recent progress. Indeed, months of fighting in the region **has yielded few concrete gains for either side.**\n\n>Even an attempt by Russian forces led by the Wagner Group, a private military force controlled by Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, who is a close associate of Mr. Putin, to pierce Ukrainian defenses at the city of Bakhmut is yet to bear fruit.\n\n>Some military analysts said that the recapture of Kherson in recent days after Russian forces withdrew under pressure might enable Ukraine to shift forces as well as artillery east to Donetsk and Luhansk.\n\n>**\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t dismiss Ukraine\u2019s chances of achieving further gains over the winter,\u201d** said Rob Lee, a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, a research group based in Philadelphia.\n\n>Separatists backed by Moscow declared breakaway republics in 2014 in Luhansk and Donetsk and fighting since then has created a series of jagged front lines in the region.\n\n>Russia\u2019s defense ministry said in a report issued on Saturday that its forces had faced opposition as they advanced in two villages southwest of Donetsk city and one, Stepnoye, to its northeast.

Without a credible threat of Ukraine attacking across the Dnipro, the Russians might try to get away with pretty minimal screening forces. So the Ukrainians let them know as soon as they possibly could that there is indeed a realistic possibility that they will attack across the river by doing just that. \n\nWhether this particular attack then develops into a full blown offensive over the next few days depends on how successful it is at establishing a defensible bridgehead, and on how the UAF decide to prioritize the effort against other sectors. I suspect they would prioritize it highly, because Putin will be extremely sensitive to the threat a western Kherson Oblast counteroffensive would pose to Crimea. So even if the Ukrainians are getting hammered in Bakhmut, they may decide it makes more sense to reinforce the bridgehead in Kherson because that will pull more Russian resources away from Bakhmut (because of Putin overreacting) than the same Ukrainian reinforcements would be able to counter in direct combat if redeployed to the east instead.\n\nI also suspect that the Ukrainians have good intel about what troops were left behind to hold the line in Kherson, and they see weakness there. If the Russians considered an immediate offensive across the river an impossibility, they likely left behind units that are low quality (poorly trained mobilized formations, decimated elite formations, etc.) and too few of even those. \n\nAnd it makes sense that they would conclude such an offensive is impossible, as many people commenting on this thread have. It's logistically challenging even with working bridges, and would require Ukraine to push Russian artillery out of range of the crossings, and then probably to commit a serious amount of their AD assets to protecting the crossings against PGM, drone, and (theoretically at least) aviation attacks. The Russian leadership probably expected the Ukrainians to take an operational pause in the south after spending some time securing Kherson City and environs, in order to reset and reconstitute after the offensive. Again, as many on this thread expected. Even if the Russians expected the pause to take only a single week, this follow-on attack came almost instantly after the Ukrainians finished liberating Kherson City, without any sign of an operational pause at all. Plus, the Russians just spent almost nine months trying to conduct an offensive across that river, so of course it would seem like a monumental challenge to them. \n\nMaybe it will be a monumental challenge for the Ukrainians too, or maybe it won't.

There are two ways to supply across a body of water like the Dniprovs'ka Gulf: boats or bridges. It is unclear whether the gulf is realistically bridgeable, but it seems unlikely given the distance. So it's a question of what kind of amphibious logistics the Ukrainians can muster and then protect from Russian artillery and the BSF.\n\nIf they can keep the BSF penned up in Sevastopol Bay and can use their artillery range advantage to keep the Russian arty away from their landing sites, they will be able to cross with boats and barges more or less unmolested. Keeping the landing site out of range of Russian artillery may actually be much easier than most people might expect, because the tip of the spit across from Ochakiv is more than 50km from the nearest Russian controlled territory near the base of the spit, with the exception of a very small number of potential sites around the Tendrivs'ka Gulf. But those are so few and exposed that it would be trivial for the Ukrainians to maintain constant surveillance and take out any Russian artillery dumb enough to venture out there. Likely there would also be limited PGM/drone/aviation harassment, but nothing that the UAF can't handle by prioritizing air defense near the crossing. \n\nAt that point, the upper limit on how many troops they can keep supplied on the spit and how much heavy equipment they can move there will be the quantity, size, and types of boats and ships available to support the crossing. If all they have is inflatable dinghies, they will only be able to keep a small force of light infantry on the spit. But they pretty much definitely have barges, and those can be used to move over any heavy equipment. \n\nThe Ukrainians are unlikely to move artillery over to the spit because the spit isn't in a better position to hit the Russians than the positions available on the other side of the river, and supplying artillery with ammunition requires a lot of logistical support, so it would just be a strain on their limited amphibious supply capabilities for no real gain.

Not better than it was before the war, but better than it is now and better than it will be as the war continues.</p>\n\n<p>So ending the war while gaining nothing actually reduces the pressure pushing the elite to remove Putin and makes it easier for them to just keep putting up with him.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand if Putin keeps the war going out of concern for his legacy but he also keeps losing, he might eventually force the elite to overthrow him, even though they would normally be too lazy to do so.</p>\n\n<p>For example, the Russian economic position could get a lot worse as the war continues, there could be big surrenders or mutinies, or truly important territories like Crimea could be lost.</p>\n</div>",

It&#39;s evidently clear that a powerful faction in USA, at least publicly spearheaded by Sullivan (and Milley) are telling Ukraine with increasing intensity to get ready to concede land in order to get peace as soon as reasonably possible.</p>\n</div>",

And in fact, even now, they didn't say anything special, retake crimea is a difficult task and show the others you're open to negotiations it's ok.

And all of that because we need 300 million to ramp up production of 155mm shells, basically a piece of metal + TNT\".

He's a frequent poster here and although I don't always agree with his interpretations, he's generally reliable about factual issues. In this particular case, I trust his summary independently of the source because I have tracked many of the same things (unit patches in videos, GenStab reports, units that reveal some information about what they are up to when they solicit charitable donations online, OSINT reports etc.). So far what I have seen aligns with his report, and nothing contradicts it. Also that comment was vetted by this often extremely skeptical subreddit and was highly upvoted with no one expressing any significant criticism of the post.\n\nI don't have a collated list of sources to support my assessment though, just some random notes and observations that would be difficult to trace back to the original sources. Basically, I trust me from four weeks ago and me from four weeks ago agrees with this dude, and thus I trust this dude by extension. It would be quite understandable and reasonable of you not to take the same position and to instead try to cross validate some or all of his work, just as I did very, very casually by looking through my notes. Unfortunately I don't have time to do so more rigorously right now. \n\nIt is also very possible that he and I could both be wrong because we are consuming much of the same material to inform our assessments. So feel free to discount the details of these assessments, that's totally fair. \n\nThat said, my main point that the Ukrainians did not redeploy all of their units seems pretty hard to dispute. Even if you're right that they pulled out a large portion of their troops earlier than is publicly known, they would have had to leave behind a fairly substantial fixing force to maintain the Kherson siege. If they wanted to keep the force ratios below 3:1 (the ratio Russians consider good enough for an offensive, so dipping below it invites an attack), they would still need more than 10,000 soldiers deployed in Kherson to match the 30k or so Russians that were there before the withdrawal. If the Ukrainians instead were actually planning an offensive into Kherson City, they would have needed around 90k to maintain the inverse force ratio. Which is just about how many soldiers I would expect to see in 17 brigades (the number of Ukrainian brigades in Kherson quoted by the comment I linked above). \n\nSo if we take your argument as given, the Ukrainians started out at around 90k personnel in the region, and then drew that down to something like 10k during the past few weeks. That likely didn't happen all at once but somewhat gradually, so up until the withdrawal you would probably find much more than 10,000 soldiers hanging out in Kherson. I also haven't seen any of the units I know were there a few weeks ago enter combat on any other front. Which suggests that those units were pulled back for R&R&R if they were indeed pulled back at all, and thus remain available for commitment to a different front. So my point that they've got somewhere between 10,000 and 90,000 soldiers suddenly free remains true, they are just farther along refitting for a new deployment than they would have been if they waited until the Russians retreated across the Dnipro.",
