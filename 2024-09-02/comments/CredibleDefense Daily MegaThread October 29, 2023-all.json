As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster. Don't abuse it though! If something is not obviously against the rules but you still feel that it should be reviewed, leave a short but descriptive comment while filing the report.",

Hezbollah is casualty-averse and won&#39;t use the shock tactics loved by Russia and Ukraine. They can&#39;t drive to Tel Aviv without triggering a US/NATO response through the air. At best, you&#39;re limited to fixing attacks, brief holds, and strategic retreats.</li>\n<li>A botched assault means Hezbollah would struggle to regenerate and possibly trigger aforementioned uprising in Beirut.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I&#39;m calling it what it is, a partial bluff. Hezbollah&#39;s offensive capabilities are limited and would be going against an opponent that detests them and everything they stand for, with an unstable backfoot on Hezbollah&#39;s end. At best, you&#39;ll see fixing attacks meant to divert resources from the Gaza front to allow Hamas to defend with more tenacity.</p>\n</div>",

It's much better to have your firepower distributed around since it will offer greater flexibility. When an arsenal ship is taken out (be it enemy action or mechanical issue), you suddenly lose a big chunk of your firepower. \n\nWhen launching strikes against the enemy, having more ships will let you scatter them around and give you more options in dictating where the attack will come from. Whereas an arsenal ship, you will be more limited in directing where your weapons could go. Like yes, modern weapons will allow for dogleg paths, but that will cut down range.\n\nWhen you have more ships, the enemy also has to put more effort into finding and targeting them compared to just finding one.\n\nAlthough halfway through writing this, I just noticed that the arsenal ship that you're trying to convey are smaller ships dedicated to carrying just missiles/sensors.

        "body": "A side of the conflict that has received scant attention; poor migrant workers that are bearing a surprisingly heavy burden:\n\n>[Traumatized Thai farmers recount horror of Hamas massacre as families wait for news of loved ones held hostage](https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/30/asia/thailand-hamas-survivors-intl-hnk/index.html)\n\n>Touching the side of his neck gingerly, 30-year-old Withawat Kunwong reveals a jagged network of scars he received after being attacked at a poultry farm where he had been working in southern Israel.\n\n>The wound, Kunwong says, is a painful reminder of the fear and trauma he endured on October 7 when thousands of Hamas fighters broke through Israel\u2019s border defenses in an unprecedented surprise attack.\n\n\n>The farm he had been working on was located in the Holit kibbutz, an agrarian community near the Gaza Strip. He was livestreaming from the farm when loud explosions were heard and thick black plumes of smoke rose into the air as rockets flew overheard.\n\n>He recalled hiding for hours that day but was discovered by a man he recalled as being a Palestinian dressed in civilian clothes who tried to cut his throat with a kitchen knife, after he \u201crefused to surrender. A savage fight ensued.\n\n\n>After the violent struggle with his attacker, Kunwong was left for dead, heavily bleeding from the wound in his throat. He was eventually found and cared for by other migrant workers. He managed to survive, he believes, because the knife had been blunt and broken.\n\n>\ufeff\u201cHe couldn\u2019t finish the job,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThis injury still hurts but I feel the hurt inside more,\u201d he added.\n\n>His story is a tragic illustration of the human toll of the ongoing war that has claimed thousands of lives in both Israel and Gaza and displaced more than a million people in the Hamas-controlled territory.\n\n\n>Hamas has described its brutal attack as an assault on Israel. But so many of those murdered and kidnapped by the militant group\u2019s fighters were also foreign nationals.\n\n>According to an estimate released by the Israeli Government Press Office last week, 135 hostages holding foreign passports from 25 different countries are being held in the Gaza Strip.\n\n>Among many of the foreign nationals killed and kidnapped are migrant laborers like Kunwong from Asian countries such as Thailand, Nepal and the Philippines \u2013 many who were working in Israel\u2019s southern district near the Gaza strip, and unprotected, when Hamas militants came.\n\n>Thailand for decades, h\ufeffas been one of Israel\u2019s biggest sources of migrant labor.\n\n>At least 32 Thais have been killed in the conflict to date, one of the highest death tolls for foreign nationals, according to figures released by the Thai government.\n\n\n>\u201cNo worker \u2013 Israeli or Thai \u2013 should be used as cannon fodder,\u201d said Yahel Kurlander, an academic from Tel-Hai College in northern Israel who has been focusing her research on labor issues in Israel\u2019s agriculture industry.\n\n>Working with aid groups on the ground, Kurlander said that while the majority of Thai workers left in Israel are \u201ctotally safe\u201d, supporting their families back home remained a key priority. And they feel pressured on two sides.\n\n>\u201cThe Thai government is asking them to evacuate and leave Israel but there is also pressure is from the Israeli side, telling them: \u2018We need you, stay, we\u2019ll give you extra money for that,\u201d Kurlander said, adding that they deserved compensation.\n\n>For migrant laborers working in Israel\u2019s agricultural, construction and healthcare sectors, there is little sign the war is going to ease any time soon.\n\n>Heavy fighting continues daily and the UN has warned that \u201ccivil order\u201d in Gaza was deteriorating following weeks of siege and bombardment. Israel has expanded its ground operation inside Gaza in what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called the \u201cnext stage of war.\u201d\n\n>Palestinians experienced what they have described as the heaviest and most intense round of airstrikes so far overnight, taking shelter from the bombardment in hospitals. A communications blackout has disrupted emergency services and cut off contact between family members. Some communications were restored Sunday morning\n\n>Many of the kibbutz farm fields on the Israeli side of the border that were targeted by Hamas now echo with the sound of artillery fire from tanks and howitzers bombardinng the crowded strip.\n\n\n>>\u2018Business as usual\u2019 for Thai workers, aid groups say\n\n>The Thai government has called for the release of all remaining citizens being held in Gaza. So far at least 33 Thai nationals have been killed, according to figures shared by Thai authorities with CNN \u2013 with 18 Thai nationals still being held hostage as of October 26.\n\n>\u201cWe reiterate our strong call for the release of the remaining hostages, including our nationals, as soon as possible,\u201d Deputy Prime Minister Parnpree Bahiddha-Nukara said, adding that those kidnapped and killed had mostly been farm workers who were there to earn a living and had \u201cno involvement in the conflict.\u201d\n\n>Like many Thai migrant laborers working in Israel, Kunwong is from Udon Thani, one of Thailand\u2019s poorest provinces.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>A side of the conflict that has received scant attention; poor migrant workers that are bearing a surprisingly heavy burden:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/30/asia/thailand-hamas-survivors-intl-hnk/index.html\">Traumatized Thai farmers recount horror of Hamas massacre as families wait for news of loved ones held hostage</a></p>\n\n<p>Touching the side of his neck gingerly, 30-year-old Withawat Kunwong reveals a jagged network of scars he received after being attacked at a poultry farm where he had been working in southern Israel.</p>\n\n<p>The wound, Kunwong says, is a painful reminder of the fear and trauma he endured on October 7 when thousands of Hamas fighters broke through Israel\u2019s border defenses in an unprecedented surprise attack.</p>\n\n<p>The farm he had been working on was located in the Holit kibbutz, an agrarian community near the Gaza Strip. He was livestreaming from the farm when loud explosions were heard and thick black plumes of smoke rose into the air as rockets flew overheard.</p>\n\n<p>He recalled hiding for hours that day but was discovered by a man he recalled as being a Palestinian dressed in civilian clothes who tried to cut his throat with a kitchen knife, after he \u201crefused to surrender. A savage fight ensued.</p>\n\n<p>After the violent struggle with his attacker, Kunwong was left for dead, heavily bleeding from the wound in his throat. He was eventually found and cared for by other migrant workers. He managed to survive, he believes, because the knife had been blunt and broken.</p>\n\n<p>\ufeff\u201cHe couldn\u2019t finish the job,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThis injury still hurts but I feel the hurt inside more,\u201d he added.</p>\n\n<p>His story is a tragic illustration of the human toll of the ongoing war that has claimed thousands of lives in both Israel and Gaza and displaced more than a million people in the Hamas-controlled territory.</p>\n\n<p>Hamas has described its brutal attack as an assault on Israel. But so many of those murdered and kidnapped by the militant group\u2019s fighters were also foreign nationals.</p>\n\n<p>According to an estimate released by the Israeli Government Press Office last week, 135 hostages holding foreign passports from 25 different countries are being held in the Gaza Strip.</p>\n\n<p>Among many of the foreign nationals killed and kidnapped are migrant laborers like Kunwong from Asian countries such as Thailand, Nepal and the Philippines \u2013 many who were working in Israel\u2019s southern district near the Gaza strip, and unprotected, when Hamas militants came.</p>\n\n<p>Thailand for decades, h\ufeffas been one of Israel\u2019s biggest sources of migrant labor.</p>\n\n<p>At least 32 Thais have been killed in the conflict to date, one of the highest death tolls for foreign nationals, according to figures released by the Thai government.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo worker \u2013 Israeli or Thai \u2013 should be used as cannon fodder,\u201d said Yahel Kurlander, an academic from Tel-Hai College in northern Israel who has been focusing her research on labor issues in Israel\u2019s agriculture industry.</p>\n\n<p>Working with aid groups on the ground, Kurlander said that while the majority of Thai workers left in Israel are \u201ctotally safe\u201d, supporting their families back home remained a key priority. And they feel pressured on two sides.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe Thai government is asking them to evacuate and leave Israel but there is also pressure is from the Israeli side, telling them: \u2018We need you, stay, we\u2019ll give you extra money for that,\u201d Kurlander said, adding that they deserved compensation.</p>\n\n<p>For migrant laborers working in Israel\u2019s agricultural, construction and healthcare sectors, there is little sign the war is going to ease any time soon.</p>\n\n<p>Heavy fighting continues daily and the UN has warned that \u201ccivil order\u201d in Gaza was deteriorating following weeks of siege and bombardment. Israel has expanded its ground operation inside Gaza in what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called the \u201cnext stage of war.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Palestinians experienced what they have described as the heaviest and most intense round of airstrikes so far overnight, taking shelter from the bombardment in hospitals. A communications blackout has disrupted emergency services and cut off contact between family members. Some communications were restored Sunday morning</p>\n\n<p>Many of the kibbutz farm fields on the Israeli side of the border that were targeted by Hamas now echo with the sound of artillery fire from tanks and howitzers bombardinng the crowded strip.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u2018Business as usual\u2019 for Thai workers, aid groups say</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Thai government has called for the release of all remaining citizens being held in Gaza. So far at least 33 Thai nationals have been killed, according to figures shared by Thai authorities with CNN \u2013 with 18 Thai nationals still being held hostage as of October 26.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe reiterate our strong call for the release of the remaining hostages, including our nationals, as soon as possible,\u201d Deputy Prime Minister Parnpree Bahiddha-Nukara said, adding that those kidnapped and killed had mostly been farm workers who were there to earn a living and had \u201cno involvement in the conflict.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Like many Thai migrant laborers working in Israel, Kunwong is from Udon Thani, one of Thailand\u2019s poorest provinces. Life there is a far cry from the air-conditioned malls and traffic clogged streets of Bangkok. Jobs are harder to come by and wages are much lower, leading many to seek employment thousands of miles from home.</p>\n\n<p>Families told CNN that, despite the conflict in Israel, Thai migrant workers were under pressure to honor contracts specifying minimum five years of labor \u2013 a heavy price to pay to support their families back home.</p>\n\n<p>Groups like Aid for Agricultural Workers (AAW), which support foreign migrants, have highlighted what they call \u201cextreme challenges\u201d experienced by many, saying it was still \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d in Israel.</p>\n\n<p>Zohar Shvartzberg of AAW said there were increasing reports of laborers who were pressured to return to their former workplaces in order to receive their wages for September, the month before the initial Hamas attack.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe empathize with the distress caused to farmers and farming communities by the labor shortage but no person should be forced to be where they feel unsafe,\u201d she said.

But it took massive concessions on both sides. The last time Israel made any kind of concessions was in 2000. And even then it was disproportionately in their own favour. Netanyahu is permanently finished as a political force and maybe his brand of politics could be as well.\n\nThey will level the North of Gaza and then what happens after? Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians will be homeless, maimed, who lost family members with a burning vengeance against Israel? Are they going to vote Fatah? Absolutely not.

Key word being *useful*. I think the conclusion of the OP is flawed, but they at least took the time to compile an accurate and sourced timeline of events in a detailed presentation. So this is my summary of the pro-Russian narrative by referencing that:\n\n----\n\nIn April 2022, Russian and Ukrainian negotiators appeared to have tentatively agreed on the outlines of a negotiated interim settlement: Russia would withdraw to its position on February 23, and in exchange, Ukraine would promise not to seek NATO membership and instead receive security guarantees from a number of countries. This failed, either because:\n\n1) The Russians backed down - with some saying that they never intended to follow through in the first place. \n\n2) The Ukrainians backed down (mainly due to the Bucha Massacre). \n\n3) The Ukrainians were pressured by Western leaders to back down\n\nThe Russians always made statements in support of talks, so they didn't back down most likely. And the Ukrainians were still making public statements supporting negotiations even after seeing the horrors of the Bucha Massacre - so that's not the reason. Therefore, #3 is the reason. This has been directly/indirectly supported by a Turkish and Israeli mediator who were involved with these negotiations as well as reported on by the Ukrainian Pravada citing Ukrainian officials.\n\n---\n\nThis viewpoint is detailed, but puts minimal effort to interpret the outcome as anything besides what it's set out to do.\n\nImportantly, **Ukraine had just succeeded in defeating Russia in the first phase of this war, forcing them to retreat from Kyiv**. Because of this, Ukraine started to modify the aforementioned peace terms by **adding new elements** (this is cited in the post, but downplayed). They had a new found confidence. Russia, on the other hand, had lost a lot of leverage it had in the beginning of the war. For instance, [Lavrov first said peace talks would only occur when Ukrainians laid down their arms](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-says-will-only-talk-ukraine-once-ukraines-military-lays-down-arms-2022-02-25/) after [mere weeks before](https://www.politico.eu/article/liz-truss-uk-sergey-lavrov-russia-urkraine-nato-invade/) lying to the world about the invasion. Even if Bucha was not the only reason for Ukraine to withdraw from peace talks, that doesn't mean it didn't play an important role. These things are not mutually exclusive, and there's not one answer to complex questions. Having your people slaughtered complicates peace.\n\n\nAs the battlefield was changing, that \"tentatively agreed upon interim settlement\" was also increasingly less likely to prevail. Ukraine [does not trust Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Memorandum) for their word at all. And we have no way of knowing whether Russia would have actually agreed on that deal, or if the talks were just an excuse for something else. To talk about this really requires one to recognize that there was no guarantee of peace that was right there. In terms of of the mediator statements, Turkey plays an interesting game balancing the West and Russia so I have no idea if \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu's comment are just a part of that. On the Israeli side however, Bennett's comments were clipped from a [5 hour long interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK9tLDeWBzs&t=10783s) and [mistranslated](https://www.businessinsider.com/israel-bennett-walks-back-claim-west-blocked-ukraine-russia-peace-deal-2023-2) by Russian media. They are largely used for a dishonest talking point, taking words out of context.\n\n>In the interview, Bennett himself notes that it was not the US, France, or Germany that put an end to any peace talks. Rather, it was Russia slaughtering hundreds of civilians in a town outside the Ukrainian capital, a war crime discovered just about a month after the full-scale invasion began\n\nNow to finally get to the question - did the West talk Ukraine out of it? There is a varying degree that can be associated with this idea. On one end (the Russian one), Ukraine is puppet to the West and can't make any decision themselves. On the other end (???), the West made no statement whatsoever that Ukraine should do anything but seek peace with Russia. The truth is somewhere in the middle. I think it's reasonable that Boris Johnson's visit reiterated a sentiment that was already prevalent within the Ukrainian community, and it played some non-zero role in their decision to withdraw from peace talks.",

Even if Bucha was not the only reason for Ukraine to withdraw from peace talks, that doesn&#39;t mean it didn&#39;t play an important role. These things are not mutually exclusive, and there&#39;s not one answer to complex questions. Having your people slaughtered complicates peace.</p>\n\n<p>As the battlefield was changing, that &quot;tentatively agreed upon interim settlement&quot; was also increasingly less likely to prevail. Ukraine <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Memorandum\">does not trust Russia</a> for their word at all. And we have no way of knowing whether Russia would have actually agreed on that deal, or if the talks were just an excuse for something else. To talk about this really requires one to recognize that there was no guarantee of peace that was right there. In terms of of the mediator statements, Turkey plays an interesting game balancing the West and Russia so I have no idea if \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu&#39;s comment are just a part of that. On the Israeli side however, Bennett&#39;s comments were clipped from a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK9tLDeWBzs&amp;t=10783s\">5 hour long interview</a> and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/israel-bennett-walks-back-claim-west-blocked-ukraine-russia-peace-deal-2023-2\">mistranslated</a> by Russian media. They are largely used for a dishonest talking point, taking words out of context.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the interview, Bennett himself notes that it was not the US, France, or Germany that put an end to any peace talks. Rather, it was Russia slaughtering hundreds of civilians in a town outside the Ukrainian capital, a war crime discovered just about a month after the full-scale invasion began</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now to finally get to the question - did the West talk Ukraine out of it? There is a varying degree that can be associated with this idea. On one end (the Russian one), Ukraine is puppet to the West and can&#39;t make any decision themselves. On the other end (???), the West made no statement whatsoever that Ukraine should do anything but seek peace with Russia. The truth is somewhere in the middle. I think it&#39;s reasonable that Boris Johnson&#39;s visit reiterated a sentiment that was already prevalent within the Ukrainian community, and it played some non-zero role in their decision to withdraw from peace talks.</p>\n</div>",
