        "body": "Two articles about the expanding capabilities of the Chinese & French navies.\n\nFirst there are new images that confirm the capabilities of the new [Type 054B Frigate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_054B_frigate).  \n\nIt is a development of the [Type 054A frigate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_054A_frigate), and is around 50% larger than its predecessor.\n\n[Chinese Navy Next Generation Frigate Starts Builder Trials  | Naval News | January 2024](https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2024/01/chinese-navy-next-generation-frigate-starts-builder-trials/)\n\n*The first Type 054B-frigate built by Hudong in Shanghai has started builder trials. This key step saw confirmation through imagery shared on Chinese social media. The Chinese Navy next generation frigate got caught by enthusiasts sailing up the Huangpu River, apparently returning from a trial back to Hudong\u2019s construction facilities further upstream on the river. The ship still features the red anti-rust coating prominently on its deck. The unfinished state suggests further painting and other work is yet to follow, before the frigate will be handed over to PLAN for service trials and commissioning. The frigate was originally launched on August 26 at the Hudong-Zhonghua-yard in Shanghai.*\n\n*The new images reveal further details and characteristics of this successor to the venerable Type 054A-frigate, which saw production in large numbers over the past 15 years. For weaponry the VLS is the H/AKJ-16-design with 32 cells similar to 054A featuring HQ-16-type medium range surface to air- and Yu-8 ASW-missiles. Furthermore the Type 054B design features slant carriers supporting two quadruple box launchers for anti-ship missiles amidships. An exact type remains unconfirmed and YJ-83 or YJ-12 AShM are both plausible candidates. Other already confirmed armament includes the 100mm main gun, a gun CIWS, likely the Type 1130, a HQ-10 missile CIWS, and lightweight torpedo-launchers.*\n\n*Significantly the new images also settle speculation on the type of propulsion. A closer look at the smokestack arrangement clarifies that Type 054B will indeed feature CODAD \u2013 combined diesel and diesel-propulsion. As such the new design remains in line operationally with the preceding Type 054A. Earlier speculation including here on Naval News considered a switch including a gas turbine in the setup. The selection of CODAD however may represent PLAN preference for careful and considered evolution in modern ship designs over too many radical shifts in short succession. This choice likely also reflects the intention to mass-produce a modern frigate design while ensuring affordability and reliability in equal measures.*\n\n*A prominent design element of Type 054B appears to be widespread optimization of the hull, resulting in a more stealthy combatant. This includes shielding for both radar- and infrared-signatures, beyond overall hull shaping. The most obvious design feature here is the fitting of various covers over vents and openings on the frigate. The general implementation is not a first, as the Type 055 large destroyer shows very similar design aspects. Type 054B however seems to take signature reduction measures even further. Notable features include a cover for the starboard bow anchor, something not seen on previous Chinese combatants. Prominent shrouds also cover large vents on both sides next to the RHIB bays.*\n\n*One more Type 054B is in the late stages of fitting out at the Huangpu Shipyard in Guangzhou. The second hull should commence her own trials in the near future. No further units of Type 054B appear to be under construction at this stage. The construction pace may suggest a lengthy trial phase before moving to proper volume production. A cautious initial phase followed by large volume production would mirror PLAN-procurement with the Type 054A frigate and the Type 052D destroyer. In any case this program for a Chinese Navy next generation frigate appears to be well on track for now.*\n\nMeanwhile the new class of French offshore patrol vessels appear to be fitted with new sensors that are part of an integrated counter-uncrewed aerial system (C-UAS) suite designed to counter the threat posed by mini and micro drones.  The ever growing threat of drones is a constant topic and we are going to start seeing forces work to improve their capabilities against them.  The French held their first ever [at-sea anti-drone exercise](https://www.thedefensepost.com/2023/07/05/french-navy-anti-drone-exercise/) last year.\n\n[New French Navy OPV to Feature Integrated C-UAS System | Naval News | January 2024](https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2024/01/new-french-navy-opv-to-feature-integrated-c-uas-system/)\n\n*The representative of French company CERBAIR unveiled some very interesting images in his presentation featuring the conceptual design of the new French OPV class with the distinctive circular antennas under discussion in circles and a C-UAS product named HYDRA 300. Therefore, we conclude that the antennas on the OPV design, will be C-UAV antennas and for the first time, the system will be integrated from built with the ship in order to protect it against drone threats.*\n\n*HYDRA is a full coverage detection solution for high performing drone and pilot detection by RF analysis. The system relies on a number of sensors installed at the top of masts and working together thanks to radio frequency signal processing algorithms. HYDRA 300 can cover all current and future frequency bands (RF ranges 433MHZ to 6GHz), including \u201cnon-civilian\u201d UAVs, at a range of 3 Km and at a 90\u00b0 elevation. The system has a very low rate of false alarms while it can be integrated in a multilayer Command and Control (C2) system.*\n\n*Naval News contacted CERBAIR but, unfortunately, they didn\u2019t want to comment on the topic. Nevertheless, the presentation revealed the identity of the mysterious antennas on board the new OPV class. We may assume that it will be a naval derivative of HYDRA 300 with increased capabilities.*\n\nThis is part of France's move to be a more dynamic player in the Pacific theater.  \n\n[France sees smaller future in Africa, larger role in the Pacific, says country\u2019s air force chief.

This was announced by the Minister of Defense of Bulgaria, Todor Tagarev. During the meeting of the parliamentary defense committee on January 17, the minister said that Bulgaria still has not sent the promised armored personnel carriers to Ukraine from the warehouses of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Tagarev stated that the logistical part of the supply of armored vehicles is already clear, but the question is who will pay for transportation. \"It is already clear who will load them and where they will go. This, again, is a very serious logistical operation,\" the minister said. \"We also know the amount that is needed. **It would be possible for our budget, but first we will try the option in the Rammstein format - will one of our allies say: \"Oh, that's a very good idea, I'll pay for the transportation,\" he added**. At the same time, the head of the Bulgarian defense department assured: if there are no willing allies among the allies, the government will look for financing options within the country and, if necessary, will turn to the parliament.\n\n> ........\n\n> https://mil.in.ua/uk/news/bolgariya-shukaye-hto-oplatyt-dostavku-v-ukrayinu-podarovanyh-btr/\n\nI am sharing this because it shows quite nicely one of the main issues with European military support for Ukraine. When it comes to delivering military equipment from storage, almost every country is willing to help (especially when you get something in return).

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<h3>Bulgaria is looking for who will pay for the delivery of donated armored personnel carriers to Ukraine</h3>\n\n<p>The Bulgarian government is looking for who will pay for the delivery of donated wheeled armored personnel carriers to Ukraine as part of military aid. This was announced by the Minister of Defense of Bulgaria, Todor Tagarev. During the meeting of the parliamentary defense committee on January 17, the minister said that Bulgaria still has not sent the promised armored personnel carriers to Ukraine from the warehouses of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Tagarev stated that the logistical part of the supply of armored vehicles is already clear, but the question is who will pay for transportation. &quot;It is already clear who will load them and where they will go. This, again, is a very serious logistical operation,&quot; the minister said. &quot;We also know the amount that is needed. <strong>It would be possible for our budget, but first we will try the option in the Rammstein format - will one of our allies say: &quot;Oh, that&#39;s a very good idea, I&#39;ll pay for the transportation,&quot; he added</strong>. At the same time, the head of the Bulgarian defense department assured: if there are no willing allies among the allies, the government will look for financing options within the country and, if necessary, will turn to the parliament.</p>\n\n<p>........</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mil.in.ua/uk/news/bolgariya-shukaye-hto-oplatyt-dostavku-v-ukrayinu-podarovanyh-btr/\">https://mil.in.ua/uk/news/bolgariya-shukaye-hto-oplatyt-dostavku-v-ukrayinu-podarovanyh-btr/</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I am sharing this because it shows quite nicely one of the main issues with European military support for Ukraine. When it comes to delivering military equipment from storage, almost every country is willing to help (especially when you get something in return). When it comes to producing equipment for Ukraine, almost every country loves to be involved. But when it is time to pick up the tab and get things moving, half of Europe disappears. </p>\n\n<p>The news from yesterday of France being able to produce 78 Caesar PzH, while actually only 18 will be produced and delivered as of now (12 financed by France, the other 6 by Ukraine) also fits with this story.</p>\n\n<p>In the first year of the war this was less of an issue because most countries had old material in storage they could send to Ukraine, but it seems now that most of these reserves have emptied out.</p>\n</div>",

Saw elsewhere France is supplying 3000 155mm shells per month. Getting 78 more caesars would take them to ~125 caesars, which would use up the shell supply from france by each spg firing a shell/day.  Realize Caesars can use 155 shells made elsewhere, but imho speaks to countries eager to sell equipment but less eager to invest to solve for the munitions shortage.",

Israel never left the WB. There is no correlation.\n\n>Which lead to the creation of the PA and is virtually the only reason Hamas isn\u2019t running the West Bank right now.\n\nCompletely false, Israel didn't need the PA, it was an Israeli concession to allow autonomy. Without Oslo, which armed the Palestinian and gave them territory the Palestinians would have still been fighting with stick and stones as they had in the first Intifada.\n\nRemember, it's the IDF preventing Hamas take over, and it's the IDF withdrawal that triggered one in Gaza, whether the PA exists or not.\n\n>Arafat was willing to continue negotiations at Taba it was Sharon who withdrew\n\nFalse.\n\n>Arafat didn't negotiate - he just kept saying no\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/may/23/israel3\n\n>Former Palestinian Authority chairman Yasser Arafat's decision not to adopt the peace initiative offered at Camp David five years ago was a \"colossal historical blunder,\" said visiting former U.S. president Bill Clinton has said.\n\nhttps://www.haaretz.com/2005-11-13/ty-article/clinton-arafat-made-colossal-blunder-over-camp-david-offer/0000017f-db18-db5a-a57f-db7afc090000\n\n>The unilateral withdrawal from Gaza wasn\u2019t a serious attempt at peace, it was down to shore up Israeli demographic fears\n\nThat's comedy. Israeli control over Gaza has no affect on Israeli demographics. Once negotiations failed the hope was that unilateral withdrawal would cause the Palestinians to focus on their own prosperity and state building. Eventually normalising relations with Israel. \n\nInstead the Paleatinias elected Hamas and poured all resources into a genocidal effort.\n\n>Olmert was taken down due to corruption and was unable to finish the talks with Abbas\n\nFalse.

Remember that Israel did win in 1948, and the Palestinian territories were separate polities afterwards. But then Israel took control of those territories two decades later in 1967, which is why they\u2019re currently under Israel control.\n\nI\u2019ve looked at various Israeli proposals since, and none of them have been in favor of a fully sovereign Palestinian state. All the ones I\u2019ve seen has Israel have some amount of suzerainty over a partially-independent Palestinian state.\n\nNow Israel certainly has reasons for this. Both with their experience in the territories prior to 1967 (where they were sources of anti-Israel attacks), their experience after the pull-out of Gaza, and even their experience with the Lebanon pullout (where the militants, instead of taking the pullout as a path towards peace, instead used it to move right against the border of Israel).\n\nBut at the end of the day it leaves us in a situation where it would be hard for all sides to come to an agreement on what a two state solution would entail (just like it\u2019s been difficult in the past), even if all sides agreed that it was the preferable solution (which doesn\u2019t seem to be the case at all at the moment).",

But then Israel took control of those territories two decades later in 1967, which is why they\u2019re currently under Israel control.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019ve looked at various Israeli proposals since, and none of them have been in favor of a fully sovereign Palestinian state. All the ones I\u2019ve seen has Israel have some amount of suzerainty over a partially-independent Palestinian state.</p>\n\n<p>Now Israel certainly has reasons for this. Both with their experience in the territories prior to 1967 (where they were sources of anti-Israel attacks), their experience after the pull-out of Gaza, and even their experience with the Lebanon pullout (where the militants, instead of taking the pullout as a path towards peace, instead used it to move right against the border of Israel).</p>\n\n<p>But at the end of the day it leaves us in a situation where it would be hard for all sides to come to an agreement on what a two state solution would entail (just like it\u2019s been difficult in the past), even if all sides agreed that it was the preferable solution (which doesn\u2019t seem to be the case at all at the moment).</p>\n</div>",

Because the United States found itself in a war in Iraq whose purpose was abstract to the American public, every FoPo action is now viewed with heightened cynicism.</p>\n\n<p>A lot of those takes come from influencers who have little knowledge in military and FoPo matters. It&#39;s easy to demonize a US/Israeli military action because your average Joe/Jane isn&#39;t gonna read the entire UN Convention on what defines a war crime, so they&#39;ll be baited without further context.</p>\n</div>",
