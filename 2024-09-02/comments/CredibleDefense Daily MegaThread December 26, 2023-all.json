It's going to take a lot longer than 4 months to be able to use all of the toys and use them without getting yourself shot down in a highly contested airspace filled with SAM's, AWAC's, long range interceptors etc.   \n\n\nAs far as AIM-120 variants and BVR, I think you might be right at least in the short term whilst pilots training lags behind potentially available inventory.

It&#39;s going to take a lot longer than 4 months to be able to use all of the toys and use them without getting yourself shot down in a highly contested airspace filled with SAM&#39;s, AWAC&#39;s, long range interceptors etc.   </p>\n\n<p>As far as AIM-120 variants and BVR, I think you might be right at least in the short term whilst pilots training lags behind potentially available inventory. It also might change based on how the F16 is used, whether it becomes a front line unit or purely an internal fighter used to tackle drones and cruise missile threats.</p>\n</div>",

That doesn&#39;t mean that Estonia can&#39;t find a workaround in regards to <em>encouraging</em> Ukrainian males to return home, but given there are only 7000 in total that seems like a can of worms that&#39;s simply not worth opening.</p>\n\n<p>Estonia might be more wiling than others and general opinion may shift as the war continues to progress, but I don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to see the EU rescinding the TPO any time soon or Estonia ignoring the TPO, consequences be damned, either.</p>\n</div>",

With Iran having had significant Civil unrest last year, his death could trigger more of that if anti-government Iranians sense an opportunity to overthrow the regime after his death.

Clearly that hasn't changed.

And, SK had the US security treaty on top of that as an insurance policy.  But that was all before NK went nuclear.  That's clearly not the same geopolitical situation vs when NK was just a conventional threat.  Add to that, you have the Trump problem.  That's another variable that could make the insurance policy worthless.  So while it's not given that SK would 100% go nuclear in 2024 if Trump got elected and started talking about bringing the US troops back home, the odds are far greater that SK would withdraw from NPT if that were to happen.",

Glen VanHerck, the Air Force commander in charge of defending American airspace from foreign intrusion, called President Joe Biden\u2019s top military adviser, Gen. Mark Milley.\n\n>U.S. intelligence officials had just notified the general that for roughly 10 days they had been tracking a mysterious \u2014 and enormous \u2014 object flying over the Asia-Pacific, VanHerck told Milley. The object had crossed into U.S. airspace over Alaska and VanHerck said he planned to dispatch military jets to fly alongside it and assess what it was.\n\n>The previously unreported Jan. 27 phone call between Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and VanHerck, the head of the North American Aerospace Defense Command, or NORAD, set off an eight-day scramble inside the Biden administration. American officials faced an unprecedented challenge: a Chinese spy balloon the size of three school buses flying across the continental U.S.\n\n>The spy balloon exposed an increasingly brazen China\u2019s competitive advances miles above the Earth and brought the most critical relationship in the world to one of its lowest points in recent history.\n\n>Nearly a year later, U.S. relations with China have not fully recovered and officials from the two nations have apparently not discussed the incident in detail. And an American effort to create global norms in unregulated spaces above the Earth has largely stalled.\n\n>VanHerck, meanwhile, warns that the Chinese balloon program remains active and that the U.S. has failed to develop the systems it needs to detect high-altitude spy balloons before they pose a threat.\n\n>\u201cIt exposed significant gaps, long range gaps, for us to be able to see potential threats to the homeland.\u201d VanHerck said in an exclusive interview with NBC News. \u201cI think that opened the eyes of a lot of people.\u201d\n\n>VanHerck added that the U.S. military, U.S. intelligence agencies and American allies still need to develop faster ways to share information.\n\n>\u201cTime is the opportunity to create deterrence options or, if required, defeat options,\" he said, adding that the U.S. is still \u201cnot where we need to be.\u201d\n\n>Privately, Biden administration officials complain that the political outcry over the balloon was wildly disproportionate to any threat it posed to U.S. national security.\n\n>In their view, because China was so angered and humiliated, the damage done to the relationship between Washington and Beijing was a far graver threat to the U.S. than the balloon itself.\n\n>\u201cIt caused so many problems,\u201d one senior administration official lamented.\n\n>Administration officials at first hoped to conceal the balloon\u2019s existence from the public, and from Congress, according to multiple former and current administration and congressional officials.\n\n>\u201cBefore it was spotted publicly, there was the intention to study it and let it pass over and not ever tell anyone about it,\u201d said a former senior U.S. official briefed on the balloon incident.\n\n>A senior Biden administration denied that there was an attempt to keep the balloon secret. \u201cTo the extent any of this was kept quiet at all, that was in large part to protect intel equities related to finding and tracking\u201d the official said, referring to intelligence gathering on the balloon. \u201cThere was no intention to keep this from Congress at any point.\u201d\n\n>As the balloon continued taking photos and attempting to gather sensory data to store on board for later, the U.S. gathered information on how it operated. U.S. officials say they believe they prevented the balloon from transmitting information back to China.\n\n>VanHerck later told lawmakers that American intelligence officials had to get special authorization to collect intelligence on the balloon while it was over the U.S. and that they were granted that authority.\n\n>On Feb. 3, China issued what for Beijing was an unusual public apology. \u201cThe airship is from China. It is a civilian airship used for research, mainly meteorological, purposes,\u201d the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement. \u201cThe Chinese side regrets the unintended entry of the airship into U.S. airspace due to force majeure.\u201d\n\n>In the U.S., China\u2019s claim it was a weather balloon that veered off course was dismissed as insufficient and dishonest. That day, Blinken announced he was postponing his trip to China.\n\n>China only learned the U.S. military downed the balloon after it was in pieces in the Atlantic Ocean. Chinese officials sent word that Xi was angry that the Biden administration didn\u2019t give him a heads up, particularly in light of his government\u2019s apology.\n\n>VanHerck, the NORAD commander, said that he had learned valuable lessons from the balloon incident, but he would not change how the U.S. responded.\n\n>\u201cThe process worked exactly as it should,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile we can be critical of the decision of where and the timeline to shoot it down, I think in the end the best decision and outcome happened.\u201d\n\n>He added, \u201cWe kept the American and Canadian people safe.\u201d\n\n>VanHerck warned, though, that the U.S. still lacks the over-the-horizon radar capability it needs to spot such a balloon far sooner.\n\n>\u201cI\u2019m confident in our ability to see that over our homeland,\u201d he said. \u201cI would like to see it over the horizon before it approaches our homeland.\u201d\n\n>VanHerck believes no other Chinese spy balloons have flown over the U.S. since the incident, but he said the Chinese spy balloon program remains active.
