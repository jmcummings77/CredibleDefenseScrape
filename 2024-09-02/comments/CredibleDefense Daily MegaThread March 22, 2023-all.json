As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

                                "body": "Unit cost isn't that different. The B-21 projected cost is $700mil/plane if they order all 100+ planned. The originally projected B-2 unit cost was $500m/plane, about $1b in today's money. It only ballooned up to $700m ($1.4b today) because they slashed orders. Adding maintenance and spare parts brought the total program cost to a bit over $2b a unit.\n\nI agree the geopolitical concerns are more pressing this time around, but the Air Force's full order is still a gigantic ask. That would basically be the same cost as their entire F-35 program. We're also talking about a plane that only has a limited number of static airfields it could operate out of in it's intended theater, whereas the Navy's planned superhornet replacement will likely have the stealth, range, and payload to safely carry out most anti-ship missions. The proposed F-35 engine/range upgrades that got shot down are likely to be incorporated in that aircraft too, which could net us a plane with well over 1000mi of range when carrying a full payload.\n\nMaybe Congress is willing to shell out for the full amount, but historically they have slashed orders for just about every proprietary military aircraft we've ever produced, regardless of program cost or success. F-22 produced less than 200 units, originally planned for 750. Less than 60 F-117 were produced, despite Cold War tensions and coming in under budget. Only 20 B-2 were produced, despite being the first strategic stealth bomber. But then you look at programs with export versions like the F-15, F-16, F-18, and F-35, and we have poured massive amounts of money in those. If we go to war with China we're going to need other countries backing us, so exportable aircraft become much more attractive. Though, I will cede the point that Australia and Japan allowing us to park our B-21s in their airfields might make the program much more attractive.",
                                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Unit cost isn&#39;t that different. The B-21 projected cost is $700mil/plane if they order all 100+ planned. The originally projected B-2 unit cost was $500m/plane, about $1b in today&#39;s money. It only ballooned up to $700m ($1.4b today) because they slashed orders. Adding maintenance and spare parts brought the total program cost to a bit over $2b a unit.</p>\n\n<p>I agree the geopolitical concerns are more pressing this time around, but the Air Force&#39;s full order is still a gigantic ask. That would basically be the same cost as their entire F-35 program. We&#39;re also talking about a plane that only has a limited number of static airfields it could operate out of in it&#39;s intended theater, whereas the Navy&#39;s planned superhornet replacement will likely have the stealth, range, and payload to safely carry out most anti-ship missions. The proposed F-35 engine/range upgrades that got shot down are likely to be incorporated in that aircraft too, which could net us a plane with well over 1000mi of range when carrying a full payload.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe Congress is willing to shell out for the full amount, but historically they have slashed orders for just about every proprietary military aircraft we&#39;ve ever produced, regardless of program cost or success.

Dependence on European neighbours was cited as a constraint on our ability to be \"safe, prosperous and influential for decades to come\". He also echo's an argument made by, among others, the direction general of defence policy in Finland (Pulkkinen) that being physically far away from 'distant threats' is less meaningful where things like cybersecurity are concerned. He suggests expanded involvement in Pesco, something which apparently has already been happening with the state participating in five projects currently compared to just one last year.\n\nThe second expert is quoted much less extensively, is appears to have made a case for participating in European defense projects being compatible with neutrality. \n\nI don't think any of this is particularly new nor do they signal any kind of imminent change in our defence policy. Nevertheless it's something to see these talking points migrate off the airwaves and into official government business.\n\nBy comparison, [a much more sweeping article](https://warontherocks.com/2023/03/no-time-to-hide-the-future-for-irish-defense-and-security-and-how-our-partners-can-help/) was co-written a few weeks ago on the War on the Rocks website by an Irishman in the British army and a lecturer in an Irish university.

He also echo&#39;s an argument made by, among others, the direction general of defence policy in Finland (Pulkkinen) that being physically far away from &#39;distant threats&#39; is less meaningful where things like cybersecurity are concerned. He suggests expanded involvement in Pesco, something which apparently has already been happening with the state participating in five projects currently compared to just one last year.</p>\n\n<p>The second expert is quoted much less extensively, is appears to have made a case for participating in European defense projects being compatible with neutrality. </p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t think any of this is particularly new nor do they signal any kind of imminent change in our defence policy. Nevertheless it&#39;s something to see these talking points migrate off the airwaves and into official government business.</p>\n\n<p>By comparison, <a href=\"https://warontherocks.com/2023/03/no-time-to-hide-the-future-for-irish-defense-and-security-and-how-our-partners-can-help/\">a much more sweeping article</a> was co-written a few weeks ago on the War on the Rocks website by an Irishman in the British army and a lecturer in an Irish university. I did find it a bit breathless but it touches on pretty much every aspect of the current situation and potentially is a good starting point for anyone who wants to read up on this topic.</p>\n</div>",

There are very little old people there. Look at their stories, look at their recently linked marked stuff. It does not lack young males.\n\nAnd hell, just look at my post history, I commented a lot on ukrainian hookah bars in kiev. Check their instagram out too.\n\nIf I learned one thing on my time on reddit, is that people love to talk so much shit aboutukraine.\n\nIt's shocking with how much confidence people do it and not only people like you who will get heavily downvoted. Yesterday when you wrote this someone went on a rant on saying people get the most basic facts wrong, and then himself could not even get the most basic facts, the content of the video correct. And was upvoted because the narritave was at least the one people wanted to hear.\n\nIt should not suprise anyone that rural areas in ukraine have been heavily and multiple times raided. But it also should not shock people how corrupt this country is and how easy it is to dodge conscription without having to go to a berlin nightclub .Kiev is full of young male people still and so are a lot other bigger cities.\n\nThe problem isn't that there is no one left to conscript, the problem is that its very easy to dodge conscription and most people left just don't want to and it's not really that hard to not get conscripted in kiev.",

Ron DeSantis, a likely 2024 Republican presidential candidate, sought to qualify his recent contentious remarks that Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine was a \u201cterritorial dispute\u201d and not vital to U.S. interests.\n\n> \u201cWell, I think it\u2019s been mischaracterized,\u201d he told broadcaster Piers Morgan for an interview to be shown Thursday on the streaming service Fox Nation. Mr. Morgan included the comments in a column Wednesday evening for the New York Post.\n \n> \u201cObviously, Russia invaded. That was wrong,\u201d Mr. DeSantis said, according to the column. \u201cThey invaded Crimea and took that in 2014. That was wrong.\u201d\n\n> He added, \u201cWhat I\u2019m referring to is where the fighting is going on now which is that eastern border region Donbas, and then Crimea, and you have a situation where Russia has had that.  I don\u2019t think legitimately but they had\u2026so it wasn\u2019t that I thought Russia had a right to that.\u2019\u2019\nBut, Mr. DeSantis said, \u201cthe reality is what is America\u2019s involvement in terms of escalating with more weapons, and certainly ground troops I think would be a mistake.\u201d\n\n> Mr. DeSantis said in a statement last week that the U.S. shouldn\u2019t necessarily help defend Ukraine against Russia\u2019s invasion and should instead focus resources on issues closer to home.\n\n> It aligned him with the position of former President Donald Trump and some conservatives who have increasingly questioned the tens of billions the U.S. has provided in security assistance to Ukraine. Polling shows a steady decline in Republican support for aiding Ukraine over the past year.\n\n> \u201cWhile the U.S. has many vital national interests\u2014securing our borders, addressing the crisis of readiness within our military, achieving energy security and independence, and checking the economic, cultural, and military power of the Chinese Communist Party\u2014becoming further entangled in a territorial dispute between Ukraine and Russia is not one of them,\u201d Mr. DeSantis said in the statement, which was broadcast on \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight\u201d on Fox News.\n\n> The statement was in response to a questionnaire Mr. Carlson\u2019s show sent to all major prospective GOP presidential candidates. Mr. DeSantis is the strongest challenger to Mr. Trump in hypothetical primary polls.\n\n> His comments on Mr. Carlson\u2019s show drew considerable backlash from some Republicans, including a host of lawmakers on Capitol Hill, more-traditional conservative leaders and fellow prospective presidential candidates such as former Vice President Mike Pence.\n\u201cThe war in Ukraine is not a territorial dispute,\u201d Mr. Pence told a crowd in Iowa on Saturday to applause. \u201cIt is a Russian invasion and I believe the United States of America needs to continue to demand that the free world join us in giving the courageous fighters in Ukraine the resources that they need to repel the Russian invasion. It\u2019s not our war, but freedom is our fight.\u201d\n\n> Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who is officially in the race, said Monday on Fox News that China would win if Russia prevailed. \u201cThis is not a territorial dispute. This is a fight for freedom and it is a fight we have to win.\u201d She added, \u201cThis is not the time to get weak in the knees on Russia.\u201d\n\n> Some critics pointed out that as a congressman, Mr. DeSantis espoused a hawkish foreign policy view and had criticized the Obama administration for not providing certain military aid to Ukraine.\n\n> In the interview with Mr. Morgan, the governor, when asked about Russian President Vladimir Putin,\ncalled him hostile to the U.S.\n\u201cHe\u2019s basically a gas station with a bunch of nuclear weapons. And so for us, one of the things we could be doing better is utilizing our own energy resources in the United States,\u201d said Mr. DeSantis, according to excerpts of the interview released by Fox Nation. He said Mr. Putin should be held accountable for alleged war crimes.\n\n> Asked about the threat of China taking action against Taiwan, Mr. DeSantis said: \u201cI think overall, the number one issue that we face internationally is checking the growth and the rise of China. They\u2019re much more powerful, I think, than Putin and Russia are. And they really represent the biggest threat that we\u2019ve seen to our ability to lead since the Soviet Union.\u201d\n\nIt's an improvement. If DeSantis wins the Republican primary, he might be willing to change some positions.\n\nTucker Carlson is toxic though. He will probably try to influence the candidates in the other direction.",

This resulted in a tendency for Soviet tanks to bunch up close to their leaders so as to see and follow their signals. After losing their leaders, the Soviet crews, who were not trained or encouraged to display tactical initiative, were much easier prey for the skilled German tankers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://warfarehistorynetwork.com/article/the-eastern-fronts-bloody-triangle/\">https://warfarehistorynetwork.com/article/the-eastern-fronts-bloody-triangle/</a></p>\n\n<p>But as I said, I never claimed tank aces will be the determining factor in this conflict. But why spend them needlessly?</p>\n</div>",

The population was heavily split over the question in itself. \n\nYanukovich had a little more than a year in office. There were upcoming elections and the door for the EU wasn't shut at all. People wanted to sign the thing now. They wanted him to be gone now. That's a demand you can make when the clear majority of the country is behind the idea. \n\n2013 was just not the right time to do it, at least not the way they did it and ukrainian politics have been a mess ever since.

Looking at affected personnel and how equipment was \"exposed to harsh desert conditions\" is an extremely noncredible way of assessing military capabilities.\n\nSaying China 're-armed' is also categorically false, as they've never had such capabilities in the first place - it's far more accurate to say they're steadily catching up. But even beyond the semantics, it strangely frames rising Chinese defense spending as something the US failed to counter... due to spending on Iraq. It's not like the modernization of the PLA would've been halted by more USN assets in the Pacific (you could also argue it would've just added to the security dilemma in the region).\n\nYes, while money could always be spent better, this vastly understates how large US defense spending is and the buildup of Indo-Pacific assets from the beginning of the early 2010s.

Looking at affected personnel and how equipment was &quot;exposed to harsh desert conditions&quot; is an extremely noncredible way of assessing military capabilities.</p>\n\n<p>Saying China &#39;re-armed&#39; is also categorically false, as they&#39;ve never had such capabilities in the first place - it&#39;s far more accurate to say they&#39;re steadily catching up. But even beyond the semantics, it strangely frames rising Chinese defense spending as something the US failed to counter... due to spending on Iraq.

Over the last few months, I've often checked my own idealism with the facts on the ground, yet I still have a deep feeling that the Ukies are going to pull off their push to the Azov coast. And (especially if/when they can liberate Kherson oblast and/or Mariupol) I see that as game set match on Russia's goals.

The pendulum in this sub has often swung from crazy &quot;Ukraine will sweep the Donbas by the end of the year&quot; optimism to utter doomerism. Over the last few months, I&#39;ve often checked my own idealism with the facts on the ground, yet I still have a deep feeling that the Ukies are going to pull off their push to the Azov coast. And (especially if/when they can liberate Kherson oblast and/or Mariupol) I see that as game set match on Russia&#39;s goals.
