The proposal is expected to pass, as no parliamentarian has spoken out against it, and in such case there will be a second definitive reading during the spring.\n\nLet's recall that the recrutable basin is significant, though not huge like Russia's back in the autumn 2022. Inside the Ukrainian prisons and detention centers there are currently 26 thousand people, 25 thousand of whom are men. Outside them, however, there are over 50 thousand previously detained men who are exempt from mobilization at the moment. \n\nIt's stated that there are thousands of inmates, according to the Ministry of Justice, who are patriots and had expressed a desire to join the Ukrainian Armed Forces but had no way, including people serving a life sentence. This is still not entirely clear, but the measure is supposed to allow not only the possibility of joining as volunteers, but also the enrollment in the lists of Territorial Recruitment Centers and thus the possibility of being mobilized as conscripts (for the ones not detained right now at least). \n\nAt the beginning of the invasion about 300 convicts were pardoned and joined the ranks of the UAF, with mixed results. \n\nThe Army demanded and obtained that those convicted of military offenses (e.g. desertion), crimes committed while in the military (e.g. theft of military property) or crimes against the nation (e.g. treason) will not be mobilizable. One part of commanders are ready to accept convicts within their unit (some officers have been pushing hard for the enlistment of convicts in recent weeks), another part is heavily against it. It seems, however, that separate penal units will be established to host the convicts.

At this point, many Ukrainians don't believe in the cause enough to serve because of existing stigma against military service, or exacerbated by the extremely heavy losses suffered in this war, especially in the infantry.\n\nBefore the war started, Ukraine used conscription, now they legally use mobilization  but it's the same thing. Involuntary service. But the rules are weird. Men only, no younger than 27 years old, up to 60 years old, with a whole laundry list of ridiculous deferments that are super simple to exploit.\n\nAdditionally, there are credible reports they aren't even trying to mobilize anyone under the age of 30, so 27-29 year olds were being sparred the aggressive search. Note, the age stuff is related to demographic problems.\n\nAnd so far the UA govt is unwilling to expand the pool. Already, last year the Rada presented Zelensky with a law to lower the eligible age from 27 years old to 25 but Zelensky refused to sign it. Why? Don't know, he didn't say. But he also deferred this entire topic to the Rada to decide with almost no personal participation let alone political guidance or patronage, so he's most likely trying to dodge blame for an unpopular decision.\n\nEarly in the war, pretty much everyone in Ukraine who wanted to fight either signed up early on or went along with being conscripted within the first year or so. Since early 2023, the opposite is happening, they're running out of volunteers and needing to rely on general conscripts, those who never served. So of the available pool, which was made deliberately limited, it's already been largely tapped out of motivated people, hence the need to pressgang them nowadays, which is so common it's the norm at this point.\n\nThe UAF has a volunteer program to enlist, even allowing them to choose their branch, job and unit. Which is making the problem worse, because that's allowing people to pick noncombat jobs, or combat support, but mostly not the dangerous jobs, especially the infantry. If they do go into the infantry, they volunteer to be snipers, ATGM gunners, etc. Very few want to serve in a line company as an infantry dismount, especially not in the task organized assault units they're built in every unit, because those take extremely high casualties. Especially when they're poorly trained and poorly led, which is the norm. \n\nBut those jobs still need to be filled, more than any other because there are a lot of positions and a high turnover due to losses. So the unwilling conscripts are the ones who often end up in those jobs. The people know this already, that's why it's adding to the problem. \n\nThe problem was made much worse administratively because military recruiting commands have been extremely corrupt (taking bribes to avoid service) for most of the war and inefficient to boot (they've at least tried to tackle the blatant corruption recently). Often, better officers and sergeants aren't used as recruiters. But even if they were universally competent, their job would be next to impossible for the above-mentioned reasons.\n\nThat's why the convict option is enticing. They'll find volunteers there. They don't need to change any laws, they don't need to launch a major propaganda campaign to sell it to the population to get them motivated. Just lift one rule and that's it. They'll definitely find willing recruits, volunteering might mean death but not volunteering means dying in prison or at least spending the best years of life rotting away.",

So unless the UAF leadership write it into the contract for the convicts, the convicts aren&#39;t going home anytime soon.  </p>\n\n<p>When it comes to the criminals, the crime they were convicted of has much less importance than other factors, especially motivation, obedience, health, etc. </p>\n\n<p>Also, keep in mind what these individuals are going to be recruited for, they are going to be Meat, serving as assault infantry or sappers to clear minefields by hand, the bloodiest missions, meant not only to find new sources for that job but also to spare the lives of those who aren&#39;t volunteers. The most likely convicts to accept those jobs are the ones who are facing the stiffest sentences, who otherwise have no ability to get out of prison; they&#39;re not going to be paroled, not going to win an appeal, they&#39;re going to rot for most or the rest of their lives. Or they can sign up to do a job that might lead to their deaths, but if it doesn&#39;t then they get a second chance. Recruitment should be entirely based on looking for those individuals, where serving as meat seems like a good alternative to their present and future life.</p>\n</div>",

There is a video of the dual launch in the first article.  \n\n[Indian Navy Conducts Dual Carrier Operations  | Naval News | March 2024](https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2024/03/indian-navy-conducts-dual-carrier-operations/)\n\n*The Indian Navy\u2019s aircraft carriers, the Russian origin INS Vikramaditya (R33) and the indigenous INS Vikrant (R11), were on full display during the last week of February and the first week of March as the two carriers along with escorts conducted joint operations on multiple locations along the Indian coastline.*\n\n*At MILAN 2024, both carriers launched various sorties and participated in a group sail with ships and aircraft from Australia, Bangladesh, France, Indonesia, Iran, Japan, Malaysia, Mauritius, Myanmar, Russia, Seychelles, Sri Lanka, Thailand, U.S.A and Vietnam. Delegations from these nations, among multiple others, were also hosted onboard the carriers. It is notable that India\u2019s Ministry of Defence had stated that there is export interest for the Vikrant carrier design.*\n\n*The Navy will meanwhile acquire up to 26 Dassault Rafale-M naval fighters from France to complement and partially replace the suboptimal MiG-29K fleet. A contract for the same is likely to be signed in the near future. The possibility of the Navy purchasing a few LCA-Navy aircraft for training purposes also remains open.*\n\n\n[Japan Commissions Third Taigei-class Submarine | Naval News | March 2024](https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2024/03/japan-commissions-third-taigei-class-submarine/)\n\n*Named JS Jingei (with pennant number SS 515), the new Taigei-class boat was inducted into the Submarine Division 4 of Submarine Flotilla 2, which is homeported at the Yokosuka naval base in Kanagawa Prefecture, shortly after being handed over by shipbuilder Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) at its facility in Kobe City on March 8. The first submarine of this class, Taigei, was converted to a test submarine on the same day, meaning Japan continues to maintain a total fleet of 22 submarines.*\n\n*Jingei means \u201cspeedy whale\u201d in Japanese and was the name borne by an ocean-going imperial yacht and a submarine tender during the Imperial Japanese Navy. The Taigei class submarines all incorporate \u201cGei\u201d (whale) into their names, following the \u201cShio\u201d (tide) and \u201cRyu\u201d (dragon) series seen in previous JMSDF submarines. \u201cTaigei\u201d itself means \u201cbig whale.\u201d*\n\n*The new submarine, which cost about 69.9 billion yen ($473 million) to build, is powered by a diesel-electric engine generating 6,000 hp. It has a maximum speed underwater of 20 knots. The Taigei-class for the first time has female-only compartments such as a living space for up to six women, according to the JMSDF.*\n\n*According to the JMSDF, the new submarine has a crew complement of about 70, an overall length of 84 m, a beam of 9.1 m, a draught of 10.4 m, and a standard displacement of about 3,000 tonnes, meaning that it is slightly larger than the well-known previous Soryu-class SSKs, which are 84 m long, 9.1 m wide, 10.3 m depth, and have a standard displacement of 2,950 tonnes.*\n\n\n*The JMSDF said that the Taigei-class boat is all equipped with lithium-ion batteries in place of lead-acid ones, just like the final two Soryu-class boats for the JMSDF: Oryu (SS 511) and Toryu (SS 512).*\n\n*GS Yuasa, a Kyoto-based developer and manufacturer of battery systems, provided the lithium-ion batteries for those new submarines. So far Japan is the only country known to have fitted lithium-ion batteries into SSKs, with South Korea expected to be the next country to do so with the second batch of KSS-III (also known as Dosan Ahn Chang-ho)-class submarines sometime in the late 2020s.*\n\n*The new Taigei class employs a \u201ccompact\u201d and \u201chighly efficient\u201d electricity storage and supply system that extends the submarine\u2019s endurance under water without the need to increase the size of the boats, according to the Japanese Ministry of Defense (MoD). The class also employs a new combat management system (CMS) combining advanced integrated sensors, command-and-control, and weapon engagement systems, in addition, it adopts an enhanced snorkel system to reduce signatures, and a new-generation sonar system based on fiber-optic array technology to enhance detection capability.*\n\n*The Taigei class employs the same torpedo counter-measures system that has been incorporated into the last four Soryu-class boats. It uses Japan\u2019s newest torpedo, which is called the Type 18, succeeding the previous Type 89. Initially referred to as \u201cG-RX6,\u201d the new torpedo will feature improvements in a number of areas, including propulsion, target detection, and processing.*\n\n*The class is also capable of deploying the UGM-84L Harpoon Block II anti-ship missile against surface targets. This missile range is 248 km \u2013 enough for Japan to acquire a \u201ccounterattack capability,\u201d which has been still under hot debate in Tokyo.*\n\n*In May 2015, the U.S. Department of State approved the possible sale of those submarine-launched missiles to Japan. The deal was estimated to be worth $199 million at the time. The Japanese government had requested 48 UGM-84L Block II missiles to supplement the JMSDF\u2019s existing capability of UGM-84C and RGM-84C Harpoon missiles, the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency said.*\n\n*The MoD has allocated funds for the construction of four more submarines of the class \u2013 SS 517, SS 518, SS 519 and SS 520 \u2013 with MHI building the first and third submarine, and KHI the second and the fourth.*\n\n*The JMSDF has not officially decided on how many submarines of the Taigei class will be built. But considering that the fact that the JMSDF had built approximately 10 submarines of every class so far, it is likely that the total number of Taigei-class submarines will be around the same level. In other words, the MoD and the JMSDF will likely stick to the current pace of replacement for the aging Oyashio-class submarines.*\n\n*Under the nation\u2019s current Defense Buildup Program (FY2023 to FY2027), approved by the government in December 2022, the 11th Taigei-class submarine will likely be built as the last of the class during FY2027.*",

Delegations from these nations, among multiple others, were also hosted onboard the carriers. It is notable that India\u2019s Ministry of Defence had stated that there is export interest for the Vikrant carrier design.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The Navy will meanwhile acquire up to 26 Dassault Rafale-M naval fighters from France to complement and partially replace the suboptimal MiG-29K fleet.

When the 'separatists' captured Kharkiv Administration building, it was only a matter of time when Avakov and somebody else (I don't recall) came to Kharkiv and cleared out the building with the help of local Secret Service of Ukraine office. It was only after this when the separatist movement became pretty much non-existent in this region. Ukraine was going to do the same with separatists who captured Donetsk Administration, and if I recall correctly, Avakov arrived there and the order was given to clear the building and seize all separatists, but Akhmetov got involved and he tried to persuade Avakov that he could solve it all without using any force and the local Donetsk SSU office was fully supporting Akhmetov. Had Akhmetov not intervened, I am sure the conflict would look very different to what it was in 2014.

In interviews, many of these voters say they absolutely in no way shape or form will vote for Biden. Maybe they vote for Trump, maybe they don't vote at all. But they aren't voting for Biden.\n\nAs the margins are very tight for Biden, even 1-3% of the voters not voting for him in these key states can cause him to lose the election. \n\n\nNow, this movement that started in Michigan has spread to other states. I'll provide another table showing the primary results in those 6 states from before, highlighting what percentage decided to vote \"uncommitted\", essentially a protest vote against Biden.

He needs to try and thread a very fine line - pacify this growing discontent amongst his more progressive base towards US support of Israel while still maintaining the status quo because like you said, the majority of people still support Israel.\n\nMe personally I think Biden's unconditional support of Israel for the first few months of this war will cost him the election. We can't be sure because November is far out and many things could happen.. but assuming things follow the trends they have been following, we're in for 4 more years of Trump and you would be able to make a very good case that the cause will be because of Israel.",

Who knows? If a large abortion court case or law gets attention, I think that'll be good for Biden. If there's an escalation in Israel or there's some sort of mass-casualty event with civilian deaths, that'll be bad for Biden.\n\nAs of right now though, foreign policy is right up there with abortion. The US is involved in two serious regional wars, I think it makes sense why it's an important issue right now.

Muslims and far-left young people are neither. \n\nThere *is* a voter group that is highly politically engaged (both in campaign donations and voter turnout) and is **extremely democrat leaning** traditionally: American jews. \n\nLets see their population numbers in a few swing states:\n\n\n *    Pennsylvania: 400.000 jews\n *    Arizona: 120.000 jews\n *    Florida: 600.000 jews\n *    Georgia: 140.000 jews\n *    Michigan: 80.000 jews\n *    Minnesota: 60.000 jews\n *    Nevada: 80.000 jews\n *    Ohio: 150.000 jews\n *    Virginia: 150.000 jews\n\nAmerican jews traidtionally vote ~80% democrat and they **actually go and vote** not just say they are. Losing their widespread support would be catastrophic for Biden because as you said, he needs most of these states and the margin for all of them was quite small in 2020. \n\nMy second point is that the notion that far-left and pro-palestine people will not vote for Biden over the issue is dishonest.

Biden trying to gain moderate americans instead of the support of the alt-left and muslim voters is the correct strategy for his campaign. \n\nJust as an additional thought, these groups are not known for their high vote turnout or engagement, generally the far-left is ignored because they can be ignored - they dont vote or donate to campaigns. \n\n\nSo in short:   \n\n  * The pro-israel leaning voters help Biden win a lot more \n  * The pro-pal minority wont vote for Trump for sure and probably will vote for Biden no matter what he does on the issue \n * ...but most likely they wont turn out to vote in huge numbers anyways, just like they historically did",

The capital expenditure, taxes and impacts of factory retooling are all short term issues that can be resolved within a few years of the conflict ending. \n\nThe first question comes down to the opportunity cost of loosing 300-500,000 killed or severely wounded young men. Most of these will not be able to participate in the economy going forward so there is a massive opportunity cost here. You also have to factor in the long term care of returning veterans who survived but still require care and may continue to for decades. Past wars have also demonstrated that there is a very significant cost in unreported injuries such as PTSD that only materialize years down the road in the form of drug/alcohol addiction, under employment, and violent crime.  It seems likely that the Russia will have hundreds of thousands more young people dealing with these issues for decades. This is very difficult to accurately quantify but will almost certainly have a large impact on the economic trajectory of Russia. \n\nThe second issue largely comes down to European a politics and if once the war ends there is a long lasting desire to remain independent of Russian energy even if this comes at a greater cost. Personally I think this political willingness will remain for at least the next decade and likely longer. This cuts Russia off from the single largest and most profitable market for natural gas.
