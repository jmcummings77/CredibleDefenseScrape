Probably, soon the front may begin to crumble.\n\n>The New York Times recently published an article that Vladimir Putin is personally engaged in strategic command and defense planning in the southern direction, consistently rejecting requests from military commanders for the possibility of a systematic retreat from Kherson to preserve equipment and personnel in order to avoid a repetition of the situation with Lyman. The desire to keep Kherson at all costs can be explained by the fact that after the liberation of Kherson, the road to Crimea will open for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Russian defeats in the Kherson region may cause new waves of panic among the population of the peninsula.\n\n>In the Svatov direction, Ukrainian forces continue to develop an offensive. They liberated the settlements of Borovaya, Izyumskoye, Druzhelyubovka.

General Roman Berdnikov has been appointed the new commander.\n\n>Mobilization news\n\n>17 regions reported on the completion of the mobilization. In some regions, the total number of mobilized differs from the planned one downwards. For example, in the Novosibirsk region it was planned to gather 8,000 people, and the report includes just over 2,000 people.\n\n>Based on the fact that the mobilization was caused by Ukrainian successes on the front line, we believe that there will be a second, third and next waves of mobilization, but we doubt that the increase in the number of Russian military personnel will help stop the Ukrainian counteroffensive.\n\n>Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said that as part of the mobilization, more than 200,000 people were drafted into the army, who train at 80 ranges in Russia and in the occupied territories. Our team has not yet seen visual confirmation of such a large number of mobilized ones.\n\n>In Alabino, contractors tried to pick up their mobilized uniforms and mobile phones from those who came to the training, but were beaten.\n\n>Three mobilized people died at the training center in Elani.\n\n>Mobilized, who arrived for training at the DPR, are at the test site 60 km from the front line, within reach of HIMARS missiles.\n\n>There are reports that Sakhalin mobilized immediately after arrival in Rostov are sent to the front. It should be noted that after the completion of the annexation procedure, from the point of view of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, sending to the territory, for example, \"DPR\" will be considered sending to the landfill in Russia.\n\n>In Khabarovsk Krai, more than half of the mobilized were called erroneously, for which the military commissar of Khabarovsk Krai was transferred to a similar position in Magadan.\n\n>Ramzan Kadyrov promises to send his sons, who are 14, 15 and 16 years old, to the front line. Using children as combatants is a war crime, but we believe that they will shoot TikTok in the rear, like other Kadyrovites.\n\n>The head of the Republican Party in the 45th electoral district of New York Boris Pincus said that a few weeks ago the U.S. Senate approved $350 billion in aid for the reconstruction of Ukraine. According to him, this is just the beginning: the \"Marshall Plan\" being developed includes the active participation of all European countries. He also stressed that Ukraine already needs urgent restoration of the infrastructure of those regions that have suffered losses.\n\n>The situation on the front line is developing so rapidly that we do not have time to provide all the relevant information.

You're not going to nuke terrorists, that's just demeaning and, if you are really doing a counterterrorism operation akin to the United States, well, the US never used a nuke so why should you?

This is literally victory for Russia, no matter how worthless it appears to others.</p>\n\n<p>Sure, he can sell victory or literally anything else to the Russian public via his state media.</p>\n\n<p>The question is, will Ukraine accept those terms from Russia, no matter what Putin declares he is or isn\u2019t doing tomorrow or any other day?</p>\n</div>",

As far as we know, Kharkiv front was the only true \"collapse\" we have really seen. The Russians certainly did not break and run at Lyman, nor do they appear to be breaking and running now on that same front. Similarly, while people are calling the Kherson north advances a \"collapse\" I don't think I've seen solid evidence that this is a complete \"drop everything and run\" moment for the Russian forces there. Remember, those are some of Russia's best troops in Kherson right now and Russian generals have been looking to withdraw from that side of the river for some time. They've probably thought about this exact scenario and how they're going to handle it. The Ukrainians have been grinding away at it for weeks now in what we know is pretty high intensity combat, this is not a cakewalk and these Russians are not evaporating. Finally, we have no idea what mobilization will really produce. Realistically, we can safely assume that it's going to be a pretty shoddy bunch of manpower, but we don't really know how they'll perform in defensive situations in particular. And that's what will be crucial. Despite optimism from people like Hodges or Petraeus, I really think everyone needs to chill a bit and prepare for a long war here. The military utility of sacking Gerasimov and Shoigu right now as you're trying to consolidate your forces and ensure that they can finally put up a stand is probably minimal. Shocking the system like that is not going to solidify anything in the short-term.  \n\n\nThe other side is a political consideration. For all their faults, Gerasimov and Shoigu are known quantities. They are also long-standing Putin loyalists. I think it's safe to say that if Putin has personal friends (as much as any paranoid former KGB officer can have friends), Shoigu is one of the closest among them. Shoigu is also a Tuvan, which makes him an unlikely candidate for actually taking power politically. As long as Shoigu is around, Gerasimov is checked too in terms of any ambition because he will always have to deal with his compatriot. So, the question for Putin becomes, at the moment of unprecedented crisis for your regime do you turn over the keys to the military, probably one of the serious threat vectors for potential overthrow, to someone you don't know or do you keep them in the hands of the guys who, despite their mistakes, are still your loyal retainers? Until the situation is stabilized on the front, I think it will be the latter.  \n\n\nAt the risk of being noncredible for a moment, it's basically this between Putin and Shoigu: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ohtCmSoLl4&ab\\_channel=gec99",

So I imagine there is some maintenance/repair capacity going unused right now.\n\nFirst, we're actively still deploying to numerous conflict zones globally (Iraq, Syria) plus forward deployed all around the world including Eastern Europe (you might have heard, threat of war is at all time high). Nobody is sitting around doing nothing.\n\nSecond, maintenance capabilities arent universal. Just because jet, helo, and truck and tank all both go vroom vroom doesn't mean they're the same.\n\n>Uncle Sam. This is what lend lease was for, and the costs are low.\n\nThe costs aren't low when we're giving away hundreds of vehicles for free that we have to refurbish first. It's only low because YOU'RE not affected by it and specifically don't care. \n\n>The equipment, spare parts (at least in cannabalised form) and the maintenance/repair capacity already exists and is already paid for as a necessary capability in case of war. May as well use it also in time of peace (peace for the US anyway).\n\nThe extra maintenance/repair capabilities don't actually exist, because nobody planned to refurbish hundreds of stored vehicles because Ukraine fucked up and themselves didn't plan to fight Russia. \n\nNotice how that works? If they don't fund it, it doesn't happen. Ukraine didn't fund to prepare itself to go to war against Russia so needs the West to save them. The US didn't fund to refurbish an army of old shit so never created a plan to do it.\n\n>At that sierra base. That\u2019s what it exists to do. It takes equipment the US considers obsolete and maintains and repairs it, usually for either re use (in things like NG units) or for re sale and export.\n\nThat base doesn't have the capacity to refurbish hundreds of vehicles in a timely manner, it's for storage. They'd have to be railed elsewhere. Where? Off to Google you go...\n\n>The large staff of that base who are there explicitly to maintain and repair those systems.

Nobody is sitting around doing nothing.</p>\n\n<p>Second, maintenance capabilities arent universal.

If they don&#39;t fund it, it doesn&#39;t happen. Ukraine didn&#39;t fund to prepare itself to go to war against Russia so needs the West to save them. The US didn&#39;t fund to refurbish an army of old shit so never created a plan to do it.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>At that sierra base. That\u2019s what it exists to do. It takes equipment the US considers obsolete and maintains and repairs it, usually for either re use (in things like NG units) or for re sale and export.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That base doesn&#39;t have the capacity to refurbish hundreds of vehicles in a timely manner, it&#39;s for storage.

It's a more general point to understand why they developed the vehicle in addition to the M270.\n\nFor the mobility part, yes, they are more mobile on roads, they're also narrower, and lighter. \n\nThe fact is that probably in ukraine (and probably other theaters) they don't need the superior mobility of the M270 in certain terrains.

Someone asked what\u2019s our source of info on the rumoured imminent collapse of the front. \n\n\nTG reports with non-geolocated pictures mostly. They summarise it as this.\n\n>Now the process of deepening into the right bank will accelerate several times. The DB has been a stumbling block for speeding up processes from the north. The North and Northeast directions at the same time will not be able to block the word in any way. The only thing left for the Russians is to flee through NK, or to Kherson, and from there, if not in time, then only in the format 200-300-400.\n\nEDIT: Comment got nuked, think it\u2019s by accident. Still updating. \n\nSoon as geolocated images are up I\u2019ll put them in. UAmaps seems to be working on them. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/ukraine_map/status/1577292500204658689\n\nRob Lee is translating Russian sources pointing to a retreat. https://twitter.com/RALee85\n\nDefMon 3 put his chips on the same bet. https://twitter.com/DefMon3\n\nThere is also a cryptic tweet by Georgian Legion saying they have a special announcement at 00:00 Kyiv time (GMT+3)\n\nA more conservative approach with maps is by Andrew Perpetua but that isn\u2019t looking great either. https://www.ukrdailyupdate.com/updates/update-for-october-2-3\n\nI know Rybar is a PNG here but his latest report corroborates :\n\n>\u26a1\ufe0f\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 Battle for Kherson: the situation in the Andreevsky and Berislav sectors as of 15.00 October 4, 2022 In the north-east of the Kherson region, the RF Armed Forces regrouped. Due to the breakthrough of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Berislav sector and the threat of the physical encirclement of the Russian group from the villages of Dudchany and Davydov Broda, a decision was made to withdraw the contingent of the RF Armed Forces to a new line of defense. \u25aa\ufe0fIn addition to Brod, Russian units left Bolshaya and Malaya Aleksandrovka, Staroselye, Trifonovka, Novaya Kamenka, Olgino and Arkhangelskoye. It is not yet entirely clear how the new contact zone will pass. We assume that today the RF Armed Forces will be stationed at the Kostromka - Borozenskoye - Mylovoe line. This will avoid creating a \u201ccauldron\u201d and level the front line. \ud83d\udd3bFrom the point of view of the impossibility of holding the defense in the Krivoy Rog sector, this is the only acceptable option for preserving personnel and equipment. However, the absence of any retaliatory actions and counteroffensives in the near future will create a threat of a further offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on Berislav and Novaya Kakhovka, as well as Kherson from the Posad-Pokrovsky and Snigirevsky sectors. In addition, the control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine over the coast of the Dnieper River is an immediate danger to the Russian contingent on the left bank of the Dnieper. Ukrainian units, provided there is no opposition, will be able to carry out a landing operation using small boats and boats, of which they have enough.

The DB has been a stumbling block for speeding up processes from the north. The North and Northeast directions at the same time will not be able to block the word in any way. The only thing left for the Russians is to flee through NK, or to Kherson, and from there, if not in time, then only in the format 200-300-400.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>EDIT: Comment got nuked, think it\u2019s by accident.

Due to the breakthrough of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Berislav sector and the threat of the physical encirclement of the Russian group from the villages of Dudchany and Davydov Broda, a decision was made to withdraw the contingent of the RF Armed Forces to a new line of defense. \u25aa\ufe0fIn addition to Brod, Russian units left Bolshaya and Malaya Aleksandrovka, Staroselye, Trifonovka, Novaya Kamenka, Olgino and Arkhangelskoye. It is not yet entirely clear how the new contact zone will pass. We assume that today the RF Armed Forces will be stationed at the Kostromka - Borozenskoye - Mylovoe line. This will avoid creating a \u201ccauldron\u201d and level the front line. \ud83d\udd3bFrom the point of view of the impossibility of holding the defense in the Krivoy Rog sector, this is the only acceptable option for preserving personnel and equipment. However, the absence of any retaliatory actions and counteroffensives in the near future will create a threat of a further offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on Berislav and Novaya Kakhovka, as well as Kherson from the Posad-Pokrovsky and Snigirevsky sectors. In addition, the control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine over the coast of the Dnieper River is an immediate danger to the Russian contingent on the left bank of the Dnieper. Ukrainian units, provided there is no opposition, will be able to carry out a landing operation using small boats and boats, of which they have enough. And this is already a blow to the flank of the grouping of the RF Armed Forces in the Zaporozhye region and a direct exit to Melitopol. Solving this problem should be a top priority and requires an immediate response.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

The Soviet system of organizing military forces (top-down without flexibility for junior officers/NCOs) is less effective than the Western system. Many global south militaries are modeled after the Soviet system either because of USSR/RU advisors or the desire to \"coup-proof\" their militaries. The Soviet system is still effective if your primary threat to the government is local unrest or a military coup, but the Ukraine War has shown it is not effective when deployed against a peer/near-peer force employing western tactics. Rapid maneuvering, junior leadership competency, and holding elite professional forces are the future of warfare.\n\n2. Asymmetric weapon systems, namely anti-tank missiles and MANPADS, can paralyze a force equipped with the latest tanks/aircraft if that force is poorly organized. This is not breaking news, but speaks to the continued importance of investing in these systems and having well-trained personnel operating those systems. \n\n\n3. A clear chain of command with effective leadership is vital. Again, not breaking news, but let me expand. Many global south countries rely on a very small professional force augmented by paramilitary units which are raised in wartime. Shifting to an all-professional force is financially impossible for most of these countries, but the system can be improved. Good coordination between the standing professional force and the paramilitary forces is vital. How well does the regular Iranian Army coordinate with the IRGC? Same question for the South Sudanese military and local militias. Poor cooperation between these organizations lead to the pointless Wagner attacks on Bakhmut while the Russian Army in Kharkiv collapses. A small corp of well-trained, respected officers who are ideally trained in western/East Asian military academies must be able to delegate the entire force of a global south military. Political infighting between competing leadership structures compromises the efficacy of hybrid military/paramilitary forces.",

One should note that state institutions in general arise out of extractive needs and as extractive institutions, and in particular one should note that the English state institutions, which became the progenitor of \"good\" institutions shaping industrialization, was to an even larger degree founded as extractive institutions, that is in order to collect danegeld,  very similar to the Russian mongol yoke example.

Everyone is happy to overlook problems as long as they get their turn in the rain, but if the spigot gets shut off they might stop being happy to overlook problems.

China being able to use multipatterning with DUV machines to achieve 7nm chips is no small feat, but there is a limit to how advanced China can go with these machines.\n\nIf China wants to be able to stay competitive long-term, they'll need to get their hands on EUV machines, and fast. Since the US has banned EUV machines from being shipped to China, they'll have to make their own. However, producing EUV machines is incredibly hard. Only ASML has managed to do so, and it took them 20 years of research and development. Every other lithography machine company stopped trying, and there is no evidence whatsoever of China attempting to do so either. Being denied access to ASML's EUV machines only makes reverse-engineering them harder.\n\nThe current plan for China seems to be to get as small as possible with the machines they have now. As EUV machines become more mature, the capability gap will grow. China will, as a result, never have cutting-edge chip manufacturing capability. In this sense, the US chips embargo might have already succeeded. \n\nAs for whether this means China will invade Taiwan to take EUV machines by force, I doubt that those machines will make it through such a war.

When the Russians transferred a large number of BTGs (or whatever type of formation they have since been reformed into ad hoc) to Kherson, they were routed through train yards in Melitopol. That said, the larger proportion of their supplies do seem to come via the Crimean routes. \n\nRegardless, in terms of the operational level, controlling the land bridge means the Ukrainians would be in range to interdict both of the major rail lines over the very narrow neck of the Crimean peninsula and thus to prevent any Russian counterattacks in that area, even if it they wouldn't necessarily be able to then push into Crimea itself against Russian resistance (although ultimately I think they would be able to do so). They would also be in range to threaten Sevastopol directly with HIMARs strikes, which would make unloading ships pretty hard and would likely force the Black Sea Fleet to pull back to Russian ports. \n\nAt the strategic level, the Ukrainians would also then control the North Crimea Canal, which is the primary water supply for Crimea and is pretty much required to make Crimea an economically productive region. If the lines froze then, it isn't clear the Ukrainians would be able to use that leverage to regain Crimea at the negotiating table, but retaining control of the canal would certainly defeat one of Russia's primary war goals. \n\nIn other words, it threatens their \"king\" (control of Crimea), but doesn't force the loss of the piece on that move per se, so it's more check than checkmate. But it's only a few more moves before an almost inevitable checkmate at that point, unless for some crazy reason the Ukrainians just stopped at the land bridge and gave up on taking Crimea by force, despite having fire control over all the supply lines into the peninsula and control over its water supplies.

We\u2019d likely still go for a large conventional response. Maybe a resumption of underground testing in Nevada.</p>\n</div>",

My point was that it would a bad precedent if the west starting pushing Ukraine to accept the kind of diplomatic solution that pro-Russian sources are promoting. \n\nAs for might makes right, obviously there have been wars and use of military force since WWII.
