From 1990 to 2020, the number of artillery pieces among large European armies declined by 57%, according to a tally by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, another think-tank in London. Ukraine\u2019s arsenal was formidable. It started the war with over 1,000 barrel artillery systems (those with long tubes) and 1,680 multiple-rocket launchers\u2014more than Britain, France, Italy, Spain and Poland put together, and the largest artillery force in Europe after Russia. The principal constraint was ammunition.  \nUkraine maintained \u201cartillery parity\u201d for around six weeks, far longer than almost any Western army would have managed under the same circumstances. Then it began running out of shells, giving Russia a ten-to-one advantage in the volume of fire by June, an imbalance that persisted until Ukraine received an influx of advanced Western artillery systems, including the American himars. \u201c\\[C\\]onsumption rates in high-intensity warfighting remain extraordinarily high,\u201d note the authors. Few Western countries have the capacity to build new weapons, spare parts and ammunition at the rate required. \u201cnato members other than the us are not in a strong position on these fronts.\u201d  \nDrones have played a vital role, though largely for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance rather than for strike missions. Russian units which had their own drones, rather than relying on those from a higher headquarters, could rain down \u201chighly responsive fires\u201d, says rusi, striking targets within three to five minutes of detecting them\u2014a remarkably speedy sensor-shooter loop by historical standards. The figure for units without their own drones was around half an hour\u2014with lower accuracy.  \nBut a key lesson from Ukraine is that armies need more drones than they think. Around 90% of all drones used by the Ukrainian armed forces between February and July were destroyed, notes rusi. The average life expectancy of a fixed-wing drone was approximately six flights; that of a simpler quadcopter a paltry three. Such attrition would chew up the fleets of European armies in a matter of days.  \nIt puts a premium on cheap and simple systems, which can be treated as near-disposable, rather than tiny fleets of large and expensive drones, with big liquid-fuelled engines, carrying advanced sensors. That, in turn, requires a larger number of trained personnel who can fly them, and a more relaxed attitude towards their use in peacetime. \u201cAt present, there are fewer administrative restrictions for \\[Britain\u2019s\\] Royal Artillery to fire live 155-mm howitzer munitions over civilian roads,\u201d sniffs rusi, \u201cthan for them to fly a \\[drone\\] over the same airspace to monitor what they are hitting.\u201d  \nThe war also shows how drones can be defeated. One approach is old-fashioned deception. Ukrainian forces found that when Russian reconnaissance units marked their positions with laser designators, they could respond by launching smoke grenades to obscure their whereabouts. But that also tended to blind the defending unit. The most important way of countering drones, says rusi, is to use electronic warfare (ew), a weapon whose invisibility has left it languishing in the shadows.  \nRussian ew has forced Ukraine to constrain how it uses its drones. In theory they can be remotely piloted over Russian targets and send back live footage to an artillery unit. In practice, the radio emissions required for navigation and communications, from both the drone and ground station, can be detected, and in some cases disrupted, by electronic attack. So Ukraine has instead had to fly many of its drones on pre-set routes, with the data downloaded on return. That is often hours later, by which time the target might have moved. Ukrainian data suggest that only a third of drone missions prove to be successful.  \nRussia\u2019s army, since Soviet times, has supposedly been at the forefront of the field and practised using electronic warfare extensively in Syria, often causing havoc to civilian airliners in the area. It has undoubtedly been a serious challenge for Ukraine. But it is not always easy to use and fratricide is common. Mr Watling tells the story of two Russian pilots overheard complaining that their radars are scrambled. They quickly realise that their own ew pods\u2014small missile-like attachments which can trick radars\u2014are each targeting the other\u2019s radar. The pods are duly turned off, forcing the planes to fly without electronic protection in a dangerous zone  \nIt is easy to recount such stories of fratricide in order to send up the hapless Russians. But would Western armed forces fare much better in a similar situation? Mr Watling is sceptical. \u201cWe don\u2019t have many exercise areas where we can actually turn all of our ew equipment on,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can do it in niche contexts.

Those aircraft are always there, it&#39;s the only base with Tu-160s at all at that. </p>\n\n<p>No idea what the dozens of cruise missile tubes is about.</p>\n</div>",

Then the fuel to lift the larger tank that holds all this extra fuel, and the additional supporting parts to make your now-larger rocket work at all, and the larger engines capable of getting all this extra stuff off the ground. It all takes more rocket, which is heavier, and being heavier demands more rocket.\n\nIn Ukraine we've seen (mostly earlier on) the enormous burden Russian forces create for themselves by requiring hundreds, even thousands, of times the munitions to achieve some effect. We all too readily jump onto wikipedia and compare the monetary cost of the two approaches. We bicker over whether hundreds of conscripts using a hundred cheap guns to fire tens of thousands of cheap shells *really* cost more or less than a few exquisite western systems firing a few exquisite guided munitions. We're happy to navel-gaze over that and never conclude anything.\n\nBut the truth is that moving tens of thousands of shells takes a lot of trucks. Every truck requires fuel, parts, consumables, drivers, mechanics. All of which need to be moved on yet *more* trucks with their own demands. Every person involved in the actual business of putting rounds downrange needs to be fed and watered and sheltered, which all gets moved on *yet* more trucks with yet more needs and yet more people. And every *driver and mechanic also* needs feeding, as do the extra drivers who are moving all *that* stuff around. Our logistical rocket gets large very easily.\n\nFurthermore, as the article says, it's less survivable. A thousand truck journeys can't really be hidden. A thousand truck loads of shells can't be hidden either, but they can be destroyed. At least when they were all being stored in big piles.\n\nA few PGMs though ... they're expensive, and they're scarce, sure. Their launchers have to be sent to a clean-room in some secret lab to have their windscreen wash refilled, sure. But we've seen western systems drive down a road carrying all the ammo and consumables they need for the day, do the work of god-knows-how-many \"cheap\" weapons, and go home. No huge ammo dump to get blown up. No giant camp of mouths to feed. No week's notice to move elsewhere and do something else. No giant logistical tail, or at least, not one in-country; the extra cost of those weapons is obviously considerable but it's offloaded to domestic industry to largely be done in peacetime. You're not trying to pay the cost with uniformed people moving around under fire in the mud.\n\nAnd obviously this 'exquisite' approach has its own difficulties (see all the attempts to spin up new production).

But it would be foolish to use their performance against Iraq, Libya or Syria as the basis to predict performance against China or even North Korea. Against a near-peer adversary like China, or a well-prepared (if not terribly well-equipped) one like North Korea, we have to assume that SEAD missions will be contested and won't have a nearly 100% success rate.\n\nIn the China/Taiwan or North Korea situations, there's an additional element to the question - can we both suppress Chinese or North Korean air defenses and carry out the ensuing combat missions *with a politically acceptable level of risk to air assets*? A president or theater commander may be less likely to commit enough air assets to gain a massive advantage promptly if they believe significant casualties may result. It's one thing to lose *a* plane; it's quite another to lose a couple dozen in a week and have every news station in the world show the video of ten captured pilots lined up in front of Dear Leader's portrait to the tune of [Ri Chun-hee's distinctive narration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyX5VWzeKPM).\n\nIt's probably better to refer back to the Balkans interventions of the 1990s, where Serbian air defenses were contested, but never fully suppressed. They downed some aircraft, and almost certainly damaged some more. (The US military does not generally acknowledge or report damage to aircraft by hostile fire unless it's politically convenient to do so.) \n\nWe know from the Serbian experience that doctrine, leadership and training are incredibly important in air defense. A well-trained, well-led ADA unit can do a lot without modern equipment. An exceptional leader like [Col. Zolt\u00e1n Dani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zolt%C3%A1n_Dani) can get surprisingly good results from antiquated equipment when given competent subordinate officers, trained and motivated troops, and timely and relevant ISR.\n\nCol. Dani is an exceptional air defense commander. Other Serbian ADA units with competent but less exceptional leadership didn't perform as well. But when thinking about future adversaries, I think it's better to assume they're all led by people like Col. Dani and staffed by competent and professional soldiers like Serbian air defense troops, and dangerous to assume they'll be more similar to the Syrian or Iraqi ADA units led by the finance minister's cousin's brother-in-law's son and staffed by whatever random conscripts pulled strings, paid bribes, or got really lucky to be assigned there and not to the infantry.\n\nI think that's the context where we should consider the need for supporting fires that don't rely on air superiority.",

At times it was basically impossible for anyone from outside EU to open a bank account in Estonia to do any business.\n\nThe public image of it all was that Estonia is a world center for money laundering and illegal banking. Major international investment firms halted or reconsidered their investments here. At a point it was an actual danger that it would become impossible to do any USD-nominated trades from Estonia (threatening to shut down 20% of international trade).\n\nNow... maybe it is indeed that we were the bad apple, along with Denmark.

In Estonia the business register is publicly available. You can find out who owns and who are the board members of all companies.

The Russians in Kherson were at the outer limits of their supply lines, much of which were and still are subject to interdiction by Ukrainian artillery and HIMARS strikes. The Ukrainians are closer to their own supply bases and enjoy more protected GLOCs into Kherson than the Russians'. Plus the Ukrainians have generally displayed much greater competence when it comes to conducting challenging operations like river crossings, and they have an artillery range advantage that makes it possible for them to build and protect pontoon bridges. Which isn't to say that they will certainly try a large scale attack across the Dnipro or that it will be easy if they do, but the challenges posed by the river are certainly not symmetrical between the two belligerents.\n\nIn any case, I suspect we will see Ukraine continuing to fight in much the same way that has been successful for them so far, regardless of whether they plan any immediate push for Crimea. They will maintain pressure across a broad front while interdicting the Russian rear areas until the Russians are forced to withdraw or become sufficiently degraded that an opportunity for a breakthrough presents itself. If the opportunity doesn't present itself, they will just continue to sit back and shell Russian rear areas. In the near term, that means they will be aggressively targeting Russian GLOCs into eastern Kherson Oblast over the neck of the Crimean peninsula and via Melitopol, with occasional raids and probing attacks across the river such as we've seen on the Kinburn Spit. Those raids will both force the Russians to expend ammo and supplies and will pressure them into withdrawing once those supplies start to run out. Once the Russians withdraw or are forced out from their remaining positions in Kherson Oblast, the Ukrainians will likely try to repeat the same strategy against the Russians in Crimea itself. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\n\nUltimately, Crimea is the most important Ukrainian strategic objective that remains unaccomplished, so we can absolutely expect them to focus either on pushing from Zaporizhzhia south to cut off the Russian GLOCs via Mariupol and Melitopol or on pushing across the Dnipro because those are the necessary next steps toward that strategic objective. Zaluzhny himself has explicitly identified Crimea as the center of gravity for Russian incursions into Ukraine, and thus has argued that retaking the peninsula is necessary to prevent future such incursions. Which is almost certainly true, but if the Ukrainian commander in chief believes it, then it's reasonable to expect the Ukrainian strategy to conform with that assumption even if it happens to be false. \n\nBottom line, they may not try an amphibious thunder run across the Dnipro, but they certainly will try to set conditions for such an assault by focusing on attriting the Russian forces in Kherson Oblast. Hopefully a large scale offensive won't be necessary, similarly to how Kherson City was liberated, but we shall see.",

He was hoping the combination would be helpful enough for him to be able to make some contribution to Ukraine's defense, as a \"stretcher bearer of sorts\" but that he would fight if asked. Also worth remembering this was in early March, so he (and most of everyone else) thought he was volunteering for a lost cause, and that the Ukrainians were desperate for help of any kind, no matter how marginally qualified. In fact, he volunteered so early in the war that the Ukrainians weren't yet rejecting foreigners who lack extensive relevant experience, just as reported in the video you linked. He then ended up in some POG admin role for a while, which seems like a reasonable use of his capabilities under the circumstances. And it doesn't make him look especially good, so it has the ring of truth.\n\nNeither he nor the interviewer made it clear up front that he was not a veteran or professional soldier before leaving for Ukraine, which does make his strong opinions about the capabilities of his cohort seem like he is bullshitting to puff himself up. He spends a lot of time ragging on other people's lack of skill and preparedness, and exaggerating the importance of tangential topics he knows about (basic outdoor survival skills like how to make a fire, festival management). Which comes across as arrogant and self-promotional, and is likely part of what is triggering your instinct to doubt him. It certainly triggered my skeptical instincts. \n\nAnd yet, if you pay attention to what he actually says about the concrete things that he did or experienced, he doesn't attribute any especially impressive accomplishments to himself and nothing he experienced seems that unusual for the circumstances. His main flex is that he was the only one who brought a stove to make tea, which is just so quintessentially British, but it's really not at all like he's claiming to have killed a dozen Spetsnaz soldiers with his bare hands like some stolen valor prick in a bar trying to impress some girls.\n\nI'd also guess that few people in eastern Ukraine have *not* been shelled at this point, even at brigade-level HQs behind the lines where an admin would likely be found. So it doesn't sound like exaggeration, especially since he didn't attribute any great deeds to himself. \n\nI think he also may have been less convincing because he hadn't reached that part of his story in chronological order yet, so he didn't dive into the same detail as with the chronologically earlier story about the missile strikes. Apparently this video is one of a series, so I presume he will touch on that topic later and maybe then he will sound more convincing to you. It's also possible he was severely traumatized by the missile attack (you can kind of see the wild look in his eyes), and so he remembers it more vividly, whereas later shellings were more routine and so the memories of those incidents don't elicit the same visceral reaction for him.\n\nBut who knows. It could all be made up bullshit. If it is, he's pretty convincing.",

You can&#39;t slap some tin foil or polished aluminum on a missile and expect it to work in the real world.</p>\n\n<p>There is no defense against lasers. Not for anything that flies anyway.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/RxgFEJK.jpeg\">https://i.imgur.com/RxgFEJK.jpeg</a></p>\n</div>",

The only possibe advantage I can think of would be that only one pod is lost instead of two should the platform be taken out, but I would think the benefit would be negligible compared to the loss of the platform. Aside from that, maybe there's a marginal cost reduction per platform. I ask this because I recently saw that the PLA's wheeled MLRS system can accommodate two pods and still autoload. I'm curious if there's a meaningful trade-off.\n\nEdit: It's a sacrifice made to accommodate US logistic requirements. Thanks all!",

My general point is that we've been taught to *interpret* it as unique. Hence why everyone has collectively turned into lock down skeptics wrt China having spent 2 years calling them idiots. \n\nIt's a matter of scale really. I take a look at the US and think the country is mental and verging on a failed state. I take a look at Finland and weep with envy. We are not 'all the same' in any way whatsoever. \n\nFor decades the uk was the most surveilled country in earth with an absurd number of cameras on the streets.... Nobody cared. Completely normal. When 'one of those countries' does it nobody will shut up about it and they're a threat to the planet and their population. It's a matter of double standards.\n\nYou interpret it as self flagellation because you have been raised to do so, not because it rationally is. You've been raised to think of your own country (presumably) as a bastion of all that is good. Why do you think my comparison above based on (arguably flawed) metrics ruffled so many feathers? People find it unconscionable to even consider that maybe 'one of the good guys' may not be on a different plane of existence to 'one of the bad guys'.\n\nI fully support democratic values and ideals. I appear to be unique in that I'm willing to admit that *collectively* we don't often actually believe in the values we espouse (or we're not willing to enforce them).\n\nThe current UK government is pushing through legislation to criminalise protest.

My general point is that we&#39;ve been taught to <em>interpret</em> it as unique. Hence why everyone has collectively turned into lock down skeptics wrt China having spent 2 years calling them idiots. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s a matter of scale really.

We are not &#39;all the same&#39; in any way whatsoever. </p>\n\n<p>For decades the uk was the most surveilled country in earth with an absurd number of cameras on the streets.... Nobody cared. Completely normal. When &#39;one of those countries&#39; does it nobody will shut up about it and they&#39;re a threat to the planet and their population. It&#39;s a matter of double standards.</p>\n\n<p>You interpret it as self flagellation because you have been raised to do so, not because it rationally is. You&#39;ve been raised to think of your own country (presumably) as a bastion of all that is good. Why do you think my comparison above based on (arguably flawed) metrics ruffled so many feathers? People find it unconscionable to even consider that maybe &#39;one of the good guys&#39; may not be on a different plane of existence to &#39;one of the bad guys&#39;.</p>\n\n<p>I fully support democratic values and ideals. I appear to be unique in that I&#39;m willing to admit that <em>collectively</em> we don&#39;t often actually believe in the values we espouse (or we&#39;re not willing to enforce them).</p>\n\n<p>The current UK government is pushing through legislation to criminalise protest.
