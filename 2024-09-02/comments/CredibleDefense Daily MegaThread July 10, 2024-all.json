        "body": " Recently Pakistan planning  a new military operation similar to the one they did after the Peshawar school massacre to clear militants like the Pakistani Taliban  also known as  TTP called Azm-e-Istehkam.\n\nhttps://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/6/24/azm-e-istehkam-can-new-pakistani-military-operation-curb-armed-attacks#:~:text=Called%20Azm%2De%2DIstehkam%2C,attack%20on%20Peshawar's%20Army%20Public\n\n I must admit I think better of the Pakistani government than I do the TTP but a lot of people are doubting this will go well for a variety of reasons and I'm inclined to agree with them to a extent though I think a lot of them expect Pakistan to improve versus manage the situation.\n\nOne the TTP under the new leadership have reformed into a more united and effective group both thanks to IEA support and models itself after and ''reformed'' as in have stopped committing as many atrocities alienating the population or at least officially. Plenty still happen both on a individual insurgent level and collective. Here's a good report on their rebuilding efforts under it's leader Noor Wali Mehsud who was there to see the rise and fall of the originally TTP as a member and subsequently has been trying to reform it. \n\nhttps://ctc.westpoint.edu/the-tehrik-i-taliban-pakistan-after-the-talibans-afghanistan-takeover/\n\nTwo the China factor, one major suicide bombing that killed some Chinese engineers as a major motive for this operation, some I think a bit to much  rather than hundreds of security personnel killed and thousands injured these last two years. That said China definitely will be watching this operation and likely try to play a role influencing Afghanistan. That being said if this operation is really China centric focused on all militants who tend to target them we might see something very interesting in the aftermath.\n\nNow some analysts are predicting PLO in Lebanon 2.0, a lot of the insurgents either flee or melt away to a safe distance from the ''buffer zone'' with terrorists attacks, hit and run and ieds bleeding the Pakistani army confronting it enough to gain status and make it clear it's not defeated while making sure to not risk permanent damage. I'm a bit doubtful  of this tends to come from Pakistani analysists who while obviously far more knowledgeable about their country at the same time also tend to pessimists about the enduring extremism in their nation also tend to believe things can't get much worse. Given one of the reasons why the military has justified waiting for so long is to get strengthen the economy  showing they expect some economic disruption from this I'm a bit hesitant to believe this will end as smoothly as they hope.\n\n\nThree outfits and insurgents the TTP  where pretty much rebuilt from the ashes by survivors and the IEA and appears to be evolving into something more. For example it's managed to start recruiting Baloch groups to it's banner improved relations  with others seemingly having non aggression pacts with of them. Given the Baloch groups tend to target China as well the Taliban's expansion we should expect them to targeted in this operation and might increase the amount of influence the Pakistani Taliban have over them.\n\nThe TTP has also increasingly been annexing local militant networks in Punjab Pakistan's greatest province a lot of these relationships are quite old  but others seem to be new groups. Many of them are quite sectarian and are trying to pouch  recruits from Islamist parties like the Tehrik-e-Labaik Pakistan even if they are outside it's traditional recruiting pool. I think we should expect a fair bit of mass casualty attacks in major cities.\n\nhttps://thekhorasandiary.com/en/2024/05/07/deciphering-the-ttps-strategy-to-revive-in-punjab\n\n\nI would also include Iran being a potential factor though extremely likely to be mostly a observer. Pakistan and Iran have engaged  in cross border attacks this year as both credibly accuses each other of having Baloch proxies attack each other though things have largely calmed down for now. Overall Iran wants to tighten it's grip on it's province following the recent episodes like with Jaish ul-Adl attacking Chabahar.\n\nDaesh or ISKP will in all likelihood on their own have a small impact on their own, they are pretty if not weak in Pakistan then at most a small overall group who primarily attacked what they regard as heresy, Taliban infrastructure  (scholars, groups that might be sympathetic to them like tribal elders) and state informants. That and of course exhorting the locals and using it as a staging ground for operations in Afghanistan. I think they will lay low and maybe do one or two attacks of opportunity meanwhile planning to exploit the situation's aftermath.  \n\nThat being said their role as either a pretext or justification will be massive. ISKP regularly tries attacking the entire world from Europe to the US so it's in Pakistan's interest to exaggerate a bit in how many they are killing/capturing in actual members. For the TTP it's official Taliban propaganda that Daesh is a US creation and in turn ISKP is supported by Pakistan and Tajikistan to destabilize Afghanistan. This creates a clear pretext to both justify support of Afghan  Taliban intervening  to ''protect'' Afghanistan  from the Pakistani supported Daesh who would benefit from the TTP removal but also a scapegoat for atrocities. It was Daesh who committed the Peshawar school massacre and or the actual Pakistani army to discredit the TTP as a false flag is one claim often thrown around.\n\nThe Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan will be involved in it, the scale of it is a good question but it can't not. Ideological and kinship ties, the chance to deflect from domestic concerns with nationalism  like the old governments before the communists, genuine hatred a lot of the Afghan leadership have for Pakistan and course the fact that the TTP bases are in Afghanistan which have been attacked by Pakistani drones.\n\n https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20240318-several-killed-in-pakistani-air-strikes-on-afghanistan-says-kabul\n\n\nUltimately I think this will be  a test for the participants,  dozens of insurgent groups have joined the TTP these last few years and while in theory they have fully integrated decades in some cases of operating makes this claim inherently suspect. The Hafiz Bahadur group for example have tried integrating with the TTP repeatably and come into serious tension ultimately settled on a status of being apart of the TTP but with autonomy and JuA who broke away twice the more recent one in 2022 when they blamed the TTP for killing their leader who was assassinated and have since been conducting their own campaign for example they suicide bombed a Mosque in Peshawar killing 84 people including police officers the TTP condemned it however seems they've managed to patch things up for now.\n\nThe Pakistani's army objectives in my mind are mow the lawn weakening of terrorist groups, proving  to it's partners it can manage the conflict in it's territory, kill senior leaders and try to splinter the TTP as well as make it lash out with urban attacks that will alienate a part of the Pakistani population. Degrading the TTP into recovering for a few years and stop the feedback cycle of insurgents outfits from seeing it as the best option to join and in turn making other groups join a rising power and restore credibility to the army. Anything else is a bonus.\n\n\nTTP objectives are to resist this operation, challenge state power and claim status, their survival is virtually guaranteed unless a disaster happens but how they handle and defend against this operation determines a lot. The TTP are fairly ambiguous in their long terms objectives they at least want the tribal areas  of Kyber but if they could would rule all of Pakistan. They can and will  sell having to retreat all the way into Afghanistan just like they did after the last major operation and their kin did when the US invaded Afghanistan but if they want to keep expanding across Pakistan they need to prove their worth to insurgent groups. Maintaining cohesion, constantly challenging state authority and taking advantage  of the PR they will get are what's important. Ideally they wish to expand operations and gain the loyalty of many insurgent groups but if they get reduced to just the tribal edges of the Pakistani border that's endurable. \n\nThese are some security incidents from the last two days. \n\n>''A terrible day for Pakistani security forces in the southern districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa: 3 soldiers killed, 13 wounded in two attacks in North Waziristan and South Waziristan (SW) districts, and 3 FC soldiers kidnapped in the SW-adjacent Tank district.''\n\nhttps://x.com/abdsayedd/status/1810581846612181444\n\nTTP commander killed by the army.\n\n>''This is a huge development, Abdul Raheem was a former FC employee who joined the TTP was involved in over a hundred attacks against police and military personnel. He was injured in an operation last month and was under treatment. This morning an intelligence based operation ended with casualties from the police and military but killed the HVT.''\n\n\nhttps://x.com/IftikharFirdous/status/1810968775232995450\n \n >''Unknown armed persons targeted a security check-post near village Gul Imam, Tank district, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, kidnapping a Frontier Corps (FC) personnel.

The good news on the artillery front is that the Western munitions have helped lessen the fire disparity, with it reaching parity on the Kharkiv frontline, while greatly reducing it elsewhere (to around 5:1 and declining). \n\nThere's also a deficit of air defense which is being felt all around either via the uninterrupted observation of areas behind the front line and the resulting ability to call accurate strikes, the glide bombs which are having much more of an impact than the artillery (both psychologically and, well, physically) and the strike campaign against the power generating infrastructure (which, according to him, can in the *optimistic* course of events generate 3/4 of the electricity required this winter).\n\nWhile the recent lethal aid deliveries are for sure helping, The West should be cautious to keep up the replacement of destroyed materiel (APCs, IFVs) otherwise the new units will be only infrantry, as well as keep up the air defense rearmament efforts to deal with the deficit and lessen the impact of observation and strikes.\n\n[Twitter: Michael Kofman, Thoughts following a recent field study in Ukraine, Jul 10, 2024](https://x.com/KofmanMichael/status/1811079176822435851)\n\n[(Thread for better reading experience)](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1811079176822435851.html):\n\n> Thoughts following a recent field study in Ukraine. Ukraine faces difficult months of fighting ahead, but the situation at the front is better than it was this spring. More worrisome is the state of Ukraine\u2019s air defense, and the damage from Russian strikes to the power grid. 1/\n\n> Ukraine\u2019s manpower, fortifications, and ammunition situation is steadily improving. Russian forces are advancing in Donetsk, and likely to make further gains, but they have not been able to exploit the Kharkiv offensive into a major breakthrough. 2/\n\n> The Kharkiv front has stabilized, with the overall correlation of forces not favorable to Moscow there. Russian operations are focused on the following directions: Chasiv Yar, Toretsk, Ocheretyne-Pokrovsk, and to a lesser extent Kupyansk. 3/\nDespite the improved outlook, rectifying manpower deficits will take time. Russian forces are likely to keep advancing over the coming months, especially in Donetsk. The next 2 months will be especially difficult. 4/\n\n> A change in US policy on weapons employment enabled Ukraine to push Russian S-300s, used to bombard the city, away from Kharkiv. This bought the city breathing space, and forced Russia to make adjustments, although the offensive had already culminated by that point. 5/\n\n> Addressing manpower gaps remains a priority for Ukraine, but the leading problem is increasingly air defense, both short range systems to cover the front line, and long-range air defense to defend cities, critical infrastructure, and rear areas. 6/\n\n> Ukraine is very low on ammunition for legacy Soviet systems, whereas Russian drone and missile production rates have increased significantly. A deficit of air defense has led to pervasive Russian UAS reconnaissance behind the front line and increased success rates in strikes. 7/\n\n> This has a pernicious effect, suppressing artillery, enabling Russian dynamic targeting in the rear, and makes forward deploy long-range air defense a high risk proposition. AFU units are pursuing novel counters, such as interceptor FPV drones, but need scalable solutions. 8/\n\n> Troops arm themselves with spectrum analyzers to detect signals from Zala, Orlan, and Supercam UAS types. Persistent Russian ISR behind the front lines is a growing challenge, especially since there will be less cover to conceal positions come winter. 9/\n\n> Russian glide bomb (UMPK/UMPB) strikes have become more accurate, and from greater ranges. They destroy entire positions, and are more psychologically impactful than artillery. Glide bombs level structures in cities that would take days of artillery fire to destroy. 10/\n\n> The promise of additional Patriot batteries, NASAMS, and Hawks, plus rerouting of missile exports to Ukraine can make a big difference this year. That said, pushing Patriot batteries forward to tackle Russian air strikes will be risky if they cannot themselves be protected. 11/\n\n> Western munitions have reduced the fires disparity. At Kharkiv there is relative parity of 1:1, elsewhere 5:1 and declining. Though there are still issues with having the right charges, forcing Ukrainian artillery to fire closer to the front line. 12/\n\n> After the passage of new mobilization laws, Ukraine\u2019s first month of increased mobilization shows significantly higher intake of men. There is a lag effect, mobilized personnel need to receive training, before they are available to refill formations. 13/\n\n> The number of volunteers (as a share of those mobilized) has also increased. Ukraine's MoD is working to revamp the image of service, opening recruitment centers, allowing brigades to advertise, and offering volunteers options to choose their unit. 14/\n\n> While Ukraine works on improving basic training at home, the West will need to help with collective training abroad. Added manpower can stabilize the front line this fall, expanding existing units, and filling out new brigades to enable rotation. 15/\n\n> The West must also come through with equipment packages to replace losses and kit out new units, otherwise these will be mostly infantry, or at best motorized brigades. Ukrainian units need more M-113s, Bradleys, and basic protected mobility. 16/\n\n> The Kharkiv offensive did not create the length or depth of buffer Russia sought, but it did pull in Ukrainian reserves to stabilize that front. Consequently, Ukraine\u2019s forces are currently stretched thin, and lateral shifts of units can open gaps. 17/\n\n> However, Russian forces have struggled to conduct operations at scale, or overcome well prepared defenses. Most of the assaults employ smaller elements of assault groups and detachments. These vary, sometimes 8-15 men, but in cases have dwindled to 4-6 men. 18/\n\n> Russian forces alternate between mechanized, light vehicle, and dismounted infantry attacks depending on availability of equipment. Some units increasingly employ motorcycles, and ATVs. This is partly reduce equipment losses, but also due to a general inability to overcome traditional prepared defenses, covered by pervasive reconnaissance, and strike UAS. 19/\nThese tactics can yield incremental gains, but they are poorly suited to achieving operationally significant breakthroughs. Larger assaults have proven costly to Russian forces, which cannot afford sustained equipment losses of the kind seen earlier in Avdiivka. 20/\n\n> The main challenge for Ukraine moving forward is Russia\u2019s strike campaign. While Shahed type drones have become increasingly easy to intercept, Russian air strikes have become more sophisticated, and Russian missile production rates have notably increased compared with 2022. 21/\n\n> Russian strikes have crippled much of Ukraine\u2019s non-nuclear electricity generation. In the summer Ukraine has been getting by thanks to solar energy, with shut offs at night, but looking at expected gigawatt output vs demand, the country faces its hardest winter yet. 22/\n\n> Ukraine needs ~16GW this winter, optimistically it will be able to produce 12GW. Getting there will require a combination of increased imports, and numerous gas units in the MW range.

The Muslim-majority federal subjects of North Caucasus all have figures below the national average. In contrast, the populous republics of Bashkortostan and Tatarstan (that have a small Muslim majority) in 2024 increased their losses much more than the country on average did, due to the fact that they are large pools of volunteers (particularly for the units of the Central Military District and of the 1st Corps, which were committed in the Avdiivka campaign). Tatarstan, which had fewer fatalities than the national average at the end of 2023 (again, relative to its population), exceeds the national figure now, and Bashkortostan went from just above average to considerably above average now, becoming the federal subject with the most identified KIAs in absolute values. \n\nTuva and Buryatia (the latter has an ethnic Russian majority) do indeed remain the places most affected by the war in terms of losses.

However, I think Putin wants to wait for a new emergency (if there will be one) before declaring a new mobilization, and as far as it's possible they will continue with monetary bonuses and so on. \n\nWe don't have exact datas, but it would be interesting to know if e.g. Tuva might be close to the \"ceiling\" of men willing to volunteer without being forced by a mobilization (there are still many new KIAs from this small republic, which is the most affected federal subject in terms of fatalities in relation to population). For example, from what I see, the 55th Mountain Brigade of the 41st Army, originally made up, in its vast majority, of Tuvans (this was the case until the end of 2023) seems to have been replenished by many ethnic Russians, after the huge losses in the Avdiivka campaign and in the subsequent actions in that area.",

However, I think Putin wants to wait for a new emergency (if there will be one) before declaring a new mobilization, and as far as it&#39;s possible they will continue with monetary bonuses and so on. </p>\n\n<p>We don&#39;t have exact datas, but it would be interesting to know if e.g. Tuva might be close to the &quot;ceiling&quot; of men willing to volunteer without being forced by a mobilization (there are still many new KIAs from this small republic, which is the most affected federal subject in terms of fatalities in relation to population). For example, from what I see, the 55th Mountain Brigade of the 41st Army, originally made up, in its vast majority, of Tuvans (this was the case until the end of 2023) seems to have been replenished by many ethnic Russians, after the huge losses in the Avdiivka campaign and in the subsequent actions in that area.</p>\n</div>",

AWACs to long range SAMs, and the SU-57 from what little information we had was simply being used for low level lofting of cruise missiles (and now is potentially a mission kill due to drone damage). I just don\u2019t see them risking it due to low numbers and the massive PR/morale hit if one was shot down</p>\n</div>",

There will be nothing left in Gaza worth risking IDF soldiers.  IDF will still drop bombs and may even do incursions into Gaza but that's close enough for a ceasefire for that neck of the woods.\n\n>While there may be some difficulty in locating all of the hostages, the biggest issue is that finding them does not make a rescue easy.
