Cross-border trade would be impossible, bi- and multi-lateral relations would be farcical, and they would still face sustained pressure from PDFs and at least some of the EAOs. Morale and defections are already going critical. More importantly, I don't envision a situation where the junta has basically abdicated everything outside of the central Bamar-majority areas and the EAOs just stop. Even if they did, I'm not confident the Tatmadaw could achieve a steady state with the scale of PDF/LDF resistance (~100k ethnic Bamar fighters, +/- 10k). \n\nI don't believe that a junta who has been defeated in Karen, Kachin, Chin, Shan, Rakhine, and the northern 2/3s of Sagaing would be able to mount serious resistance if a combined 3BA/Sagaing PDF/KIA force moved on Mandalay, especially if a southern PDF/Karenni combination is threatening the capital in Naypyidaw. Obviously air power is a concern and maybe I'm underrating it, but victories in Shan and probably further ones in Rakhine will result in massive materiel windfalls which may provide counters. Wa also possesses AA but I'm not counting on them. \n\nThe (major, northern) EAOs are not so parochial as to just stop once they reach the valley. In this scenario, they would have so much momentum it's hard to imagine them just... stopping. They *hate* the junta. They also have genuine connections to the NUG; there's real desire to see a federalist system work as opposed to earlier arrangements characterized by unsteady ceasefires and routine outbreaks of violence. I think some people conflate EAO self-interest and desire for autonomy with not caring about who rules in Naypyidaw, which is just not the case. EAOs also are receiving significant funding from NUG. I would not be totally surprised to see them suddenly feign disinterest to leverage greater instant support and prospective political concessions from NUG, *but they aren't going accept a settlement with the junta if the situation on the ground still favors them.* It does and will continue to do so.\n\nKarenni factions are already operating in the heartland. The KNDF (likely 4-8k fighters) operates in tandem with the PDFs under a partially-assimilated command structure (via NUG). KNLA/KNU (20k) is closely aligned with the PDFs, mostly through KNDF as intermediary and has been fighting throughout northern Karen and northern Bago up to outskirts of Naypyidaw; KNPP (4k) is involved too. I don't have numbers on PDF forces in Karen and Bago specifically but probably 20k at an absolute minimum. \n\nSagaing PDFs number probably 50k minimum fighters, they have received some tactical assistance from the Kachin Independence Army (25k fighters). Cooperation between the two has been rising as PDFs become more and more organized and well-equipped. It's entirely possible that they could mount a co-offensive against Mandalay from the west while TNLA (8k) and MNDAA (5k) come from the east. The only reason I'm less confident in KIA getting super involved is that they didn't join the 3BA and despite being members of NUG are a little more tentative than the Karenni factions. This isn't even considering the fourth 3BA/NA member Arakan Army (30k) who are currently burning through northern Rakhine and probably will move to Western Command HQ in Ann soon.\n\nThe resistance is snowballing.",

Even if they did, I&#39;m not confident the Tatmadaw could achieve a steady state with the scale of PDF/LDF resistance (~100k ethnic Bamar fighters, +/- 10k). </p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t believe that a junta who has been defeated in Karen, Kachin, Chin, Shan, Rakhine, and the northern 2/3s of Sagaing would be able to mount serious resistance if a combined 3BA/Sagaing PDF/KIA force moved on Mandalay, especially if a southern PDF/Karenni combination is threatening the capital in Naypyidaw. Obviously air power is a concern and maybe I&#39;m underrating it, but victories in Shan and probably further ones in Rakhine will result in massive materiel windfalls which may provide counters. Wa also possesses AA but I&#39;m not counting on them. </p>\n\n<p>The (major, northern) EAOs are not so parochial as to just stop once they reach the valley. In this scenario, they would have so much momentum it&#39;s hard to imagine them just... stopping. They <em>hate</em> the junta. They also have genuine connections to the NUG; there&#39;s real desire to see a federalist system work as opposed to earlier arrangements characterized by unsteady ceasefires and routine outbreaks of violence. I think some people conflate EAO self-interest and desire for autonomy with not caring about who rules in Naypyidaw, which is just not the case. EAOs also are receiving significant funding from NUG. I would not be totally surprised to see them suddenly feign disinterest to leverage greater instant support and prospective political concessions from NUG, <em>but they aren&#39;t going accept a settlement with the junta if the situation on the ground still favors them.</em> It does and will continue to do so.</p>\n\n<p>Karenni factions are already operating in the heartland. The KNDF (likely 4-8k fighters) operates in tandem with the PDFs under a partially-assimilated command structure (via NUG). KNLA/KNU (20k) is closely aligned with the PDFs, mostly through KNDF as intermediary and has been fighting throughout northern Karen and northern Bago up to outskirts of Naypyidaw; KNPP (4k) is involved too. I don&#39;t have numbers on PDF forces in Karen and Bago specifically but probably 20k at an absolute minimum. </p>\n\n<p>Sagaing PDFs number probably 50k minimum fighters, they have received some tactical assistance from the Kachin Independence Army (25k fighters). Cooperation between the two has been rising as PDFs become more and more organized and well-equipped. It&#39;s entirely possible that they could mount a co-offensive against Mandalay from the west while TNLA (8k) and MNDAA (5k) come from the east. The only reason I&#39;m less confident in KIA getting super involved is that they didn&#39;t join the 3BA and despite being members of NUG are a little more tentative than the Karenni factions. This isn&#39;t even considering the fourth 3BA/NA member Arakan Army (30k) who are currently burning through northern Rakhine and probably will move to Western Command HQ in Ann soon.</p>\n\n<p>The resistance is snowballing.</p>\n</div>",

People were pissed off about the coup in 2021.\n\nHonestly I think most people of myanmar, minority or bamar, are totally sick of the Tatmadaw.

If it's not an issue, I will post it here below.  \n\nThe interviewee's answers (call sign \"Fritz\") are in *italics*. My additions to clarify some stuff are between [square brackets]. \n\n>The lawyer, who has been volunteering in Avdiivka since 2014, joined the 47th Brigade in 2022 and lost his leg during the first assault on the unit in the Zaporizhzhia sector in June 2023. \n\n>Only a month ago, Mykola stood up again on his now only leg. The 38-year-old man had been blown up three times and suffered severe injuries. Not only his right leg was blown off, but his left leg was also torn off, and both his arms and face were burned. That is why his treatment was quite lengthy, until the Kyivan [from Kyiv] was finally able to move around in a wheelchair, and then start walking with the help of a walker. Mykola dreams of a prosthesis, but his stump needs to heal and form well... And his right foot needs to be restored - rehabilitation specialists at the NextStepUkraine center are currently working with it. And this means pain and constant medical \"findings\" - either the wounds become inflamed or the nerve needs to be stitched... And there is no end in sight.\n\n>At the beginning of the full-scale offensive, you were...\n\n>*... a commander of a rifle platoon. We were defending Kyiv. In June 2022, my platoon became an anti-aircraft missile platoon. By the way, we had good success, even shooting down operational and tactical UAVs. But then the commander of the 47th Regiment, Vanya Shalamaha, invited me to the position of company commander. I accepted the position.*\n\n>Did you know each other before that?\n\n>*We had mutual friends, let's say, along nationalist lines. His father is a nationalist. I try to put myself in this category, although nowadays it is sometimes discredited. Vanya saw me as a prospect. In fact, during the defense of Kyiv, I hope I proved myself to be a good soldier, just like our platoon.*\n\n>Until 2022, you were always with volunteers, traveling to the war. What is your military experience and with whom did you cooperate?\n\n>*I cooperated with the 1st Assault Company [part of \"DUK Pravyj Sektor\", now the 67th Mechanized Brigade]. As I cooperated, I was a subordinate. I would come and join the ranks, perform the tasks I was given. If I had to wash the floor, I did it, if I had to carry mines, I carried them, if I had to do something else, I did it. I did not challenge not only one order, but not a single wish, neither of Tengiz, nor of Da Vinci [commanders from DUK PS], nor of my other commanders. Because, frankly, I was not in a very high position in this hierarchy, but it suited me, because I: a) believed that I was defending Ukraine; b) helped my friends - wow. And it was the right thing to do. It was this experience that helped me to quickly assemble a platoon when we had to defend Kyiv. I knew what to do, I knew what war was, I understood the challenges. And, in principle, he understood what to do with the soldiers so that they would not simply run away. We all remember what a mess it was in the first days of the defense of Kyiv, how, excuse me, some rifle platoons, even companies, simply ran away from their positions. Why? Because the euphoria ends the moment you are given a rifle and told: \"Go there, defend the sector\". We also had different situations. But we carried out any order. In the battalion we were in, our platoon was considered one of the best.*\n\n>How did you start in the 47th Brigade? I understand that you were trained with them abroad.\n\n>*When I was called to the 47th, they said it would be a new company that I could create myself. But in the end I came to an already established company. It had even been trained in western Ukraine. I came and was told: \"Here are 110 people, take them\". I asked: \"How? I was told to create a company\". The reply: \"It's already been created, catch it\". I accepted the offer.*\n\n>Who was there, what professions? Was there anyone with military experience?\n\n>*There were a few so-called \"atovtsy\" [veterans of the ATO, i.e. the Donbas War 2014-2022], but among them there were completely different people. There were those who had just spent some time in dugouts. These people were not going to storm anything at all. Their main task, as I saw it, was to get laid. We parted ways with them later. But there were people who really went through the ATO. For example, Petya Kolodiy became a company technician. First of all, he was in his place, secondly, he was brave, and thirdly, you realize that he had fought and knew what to do. This was a man who could understand any engine, get the parts. And when we were hit, he covered me, shouted: \"Commander, I'm here!\" I made him move back and jump into the trench. But he was really brave, I respect him. In general, the contingent was very diverse. There was a man who frankly said: \"I have many children. I won't go to combat. And in general, I have enuresis - here is a certificate\". What can you do? There were those who did not always understand where they were going. They were simply mobilized, brought in, and left, and they also did not understand what was happening. But most of them were highly motivated. People came from big businesses. I asked them questions: \"Why? You were doing well\". \"I think it's right to defend Ukraine\". I tried to rely on people with high motivation.*\n\n>Tell us about the training, because your brigade has been preparing for the longest time, and has undergone various coordination exercises. In your opinion, have people been taught how to fight?\n\n>*The training was long, because at first, as I remember, it was a reconnaissance battalion. Then it became an assault regiment, and later a mechanized brigade. The tactics of an assault regiment and a mechanized brigade are completely different. That is why people had to be retrained. Was the training too long? Yes, it was. But are people to blame for this? No. The soldier is not to blame for the fact that the command is constantly changing plans.*\n\n>Well, it's just as well that the training took a long time, people learned...\n\n>*You see, most people were \"burning out\", and you just made them find the fire in themselves again. Constant communication, constant explanations of why this is happening. Understand: at first you are an assault regiment and learn to storm houses. Then they say you are a mechanized brigade and give you MaxxPros, which you see for the first time in your life. They give you grenade launchers, I think MK-13, and you don't understand how to put them on. And then they take everything away from you and give you Bradleys, but you also have to go to school to learn how to use them. In other words, three learning processes actually took place, and people went through three training courses. Of course, they were burned out. And I am very happy that people in my company did not lose this fire, and when they had to perform tasks, they did. I will say that a great deal of responsibility was borne by the platoon commanders, who understood my logic in some places, and came to conclusions themselves in others. And when I said, for example: \"You will assault at night\", people quite deliberately trained at night, put marks on themselves and learned to walk in trenches at night. Even after the training in Germany, we continued to study. We did not let the soldiers relax.*\n\n>Good, but what about you? You knew that your friends were fighting while you were studying. How did you motivate yourself that the day would come when you would be useful?\n\n>*It was hard to realize that my friends were fighting, and you... But you understand what responsibility you have. You're a company commander, you have 119 men. If you start whining now, that's it, the company will fall apart. It's difficult. But okay. Take the ball and play...*\n\n>Is Bradley really a reliable machine? What impression did it make on you?\n\n>*The Americans have a completely different approach to training, not the Soviet one. How does the Ukrainian Army train on BMPs? \"Kids, here's an infantry fighting vehicle, but we're not going to start it because there's no diesel. And here is a gun, but we won't shoot it because there are no bullets. And in general, don't touch anything with your hands, because it will fall apart. We'd better practice the landing, and that's it\". That is, in fact, the soldier knows how to land from an \"infantry war grave\" (because BMP-2 is a war grave). That's how the training process works in our army. And in the American Army: \"Here's a Bradley. And we never run out of diesel fuel or ammunition\". We fired 74 shots a day, and we covered normal kilometers. The Americans were not afraid. On the first day, they explained everything, and on the second day we got on the Bradley. And each of the crews (infantry and crews were trained separately) rode five to ten kilometers. On the first day of driving, I was already doing the backup at night, refueling the vehicles. After any training, the vehicles must be thoroughly washed - the Americans themselves do it and demanded it from our soldiers.*\n \n>Listen, I had this feeling: \"Oh, this is a cool vehicle! We're going to win with it!\" \n\n>*Yes, there was a feeling that it was a cool machine. And there was a sense of confidence. You learned so much from it, you understood what was what, what breakdowns could and how to fix them.  Again, how are the company tactical training? On the first day, you learn what is required of you, but here is a huge field - a huge field, here's a Bradley, learn how to maneuver. And you learn to maneuver platoons, companies, and you communicate with each vehicle commander. There were those who worked on Bechas [BMPs/BTRs], and they said: \"Oh, it's a rocket bomb!\"*  [Part 1/3]",

                "body": ">Did you already know then that you were being trained to carry out a powerful assault in a certain direction, that a lot of emphasis was placed on you?\n\n>*I realized this during company exercises, and I was convinced of it during battalion tactical exercises. Because what we stormed during company and battalion tactical exercises reflected both the Kherson region's terrain and the \"dragon's teeth\". The Americans went to the trouble of doing everything we needed to storm. The only thing that was not foreseen was mined landings. During company and battalion tactical exercises, we constantly used this, entering the rear through the landings (the Americans played the role of the Russians). I was proud of my guys, who actually walked six to eight kilometers through the forest, exposing enemy observation posts. It was very interesting. Each company commander had an American company commander next to him, and you had to ask him questions. If you were not shy, everything was explained to you. I was always asking questions. My \"Capt. Jack\"... He even twitched his eye, but until I fully understood the task, I did not leave him. We often spent the night on those towers, and he was explaining to me for the twentieth time how to use the Bradley correctly. Again, there were people who had fought in the Gulf, and they explained how they countered tanks there. It was all very interesting. Basically, I tortured everyone very hard. I had Chris next to me, who is now dead... He spoke very good English, and the two of us were constantly beating the Americans to understand everything. I think the problem with several companies of the brigade, the officers of the brigade, was that instead of kicking their instructors' asses, they went to bed. This is my opinion.*\n\n>When did you arrive in the area of responsibility and receive your assignment? When did you get the order to go on the assault?\n\n>*At first, we were redeployed to Zaporizhzhia region, to the south, in mid-May. There was already a corps planning meeting, and all company commanders were invited to attend. There, they began to explain to us what would happen next. That is, in May, I understood perfectly well what I had to do, I understood the task of my company. I gathered platoon commanders and section commanders and began to explain their actions to everyone. We were even able to model the positions we had to storm, and every night we practiced, practiced, practiced... We strained all our financial resources, bought night vision devices, because we lacked them, even though we were better equipped than other brigades. There was a very strong kinship. Each soldier understood his task, each could clearly say what he was doing at each stage.*\n\n>And the burden of responsibility, that the whole country was watching you, that you would reach Mariupol and we would win... Didn't it put pressure on you?\n\n>*Listen, I've been in this life for a long time... I understand what a pretentious choss is. And I understand that what is planned can go wrong. And I told my soldiers a simple thing: it will be difficult, and then you will not fight for Ukraine - you will fight for each other, for the one on the right, on the left, behind, in front. And I will fight for you as long as I am able. And I explained quite calmly: after me, my friend Lys (Yevtushenko Dmitry Sanych) is in charge, the best officer I have ever seen. Honestly, I think he has very great prospects. Dmytro Sanych falls out - his friend Chris (Rest in Peace) follows him, Chris falls out - the Professor (Rest in Peace), he falls out - another commander... Everyone in the company understood the transfer of control of platoons, everyone understood the transfer of control of squads. Yes, this was due to a certain misunderstanding on the part of the soldiers: what else do you want from us? We've been studying for nine months, we've been winding turnstiles with our eyes closed... What else do you want?*\n\n>When was the first assault you went on? What was your first experience?\n\n>*The first experience was that we were late for the assault... According to the plan, we were supposed to assault right after the 3rd Battalion. But because of the failures in planning, we were, to put it mildly, three hours late, so, of course, we could not help. It was already morning, and it was very difficult to fight the Russians during the day because of their superiority in artillery, aviation, and UAVs. So we started to clarify the tasks before landing. They were adjusted based on the experience of the 3rd Battalion. Now we had to walk not 12 kilometers, but only 6. But from what we had already heard from the 3rd Battalion and others... You know, the Army is a big collective farm, everyone started asking each other: what, how, where? When I heard what happened, I explained to the platoon and section commanders their tasks and promised the barrier units that we would cover them as long as the Bushmasters were firing. And so it happened. We covered them, they did their job, and we still managed to capture certain positions, repel counterattacks and, in principle, prepare for defense. The Russians were not able to knock us out with counterattacks.*\n\n>What date did this happen?\n\n>*June 9. We seized the positions, repelled the first counterattack, and began to dig in. I was wounded, and my friend Lys took over the command, and he continued to lead the company, and he led it quite well. We accomplished our task with minimal losses.\n When other companies already had \"two hundredths\" [KIAs], most of the equipment was damaged, I had only ten \"three hundredths\" [WIAs]. The dead came after I had fallen. But there were objective reasons for that, because the Russian artillery simply mixed our positions with the black soil.*\n \n>How did you get blown up, what was it like?\n\n>*How... We called the Bradley, which was supposed to evacuate the first wounded. I saw that it was about to drive across the minefield, jumped out of the landing and started waving my hands where to go. I heard shots, saw my leg fly off, was surprised... Most likely, it was a large-caliber machine gun, because there were tanks on the enemy's \"Real Madrid\" position, and they were working. I started jumping on my left leg, stepped on an anti-personnel mine, and fell on my back. Apparently, the \"petal\" [PFM-1 mine] worked, because during the period when we captured and repelled the first attack, there was a massive remote mining. Every ten meters in the sky there was an explosion, explosion, explosion... The sky turned pitch-black, I've never seen anything like it in movies. The detonation went off, and I turned over on my stomach. Something also went off under my chest, and I was thrown again. I have good armor, so the blast wave went through my arms. After all these explosions, I fell down, lying down and looking around: my hands were burned. I realize that I can't do anything for myself now. But my friend Piro was next to me, and I called out, \"Piro, help!\" Piro ran across the minefield to save me. And he did. In a minute or two, he put four tourniquets on me, somehow tied my leg with paracord and pulled me out.*\n\n>Was the leg there? I mean, did they try to save the severed leg?\n\n>*It was hanging on to a piece of muscle, dangling. While this was happening, I was shouting at him to radio about the injury, to hand over control. I don't know why I didn't lose consciousness. Until I heard that everyone understood about the transfer of control, I didn't calm down, I was beating him up. He was bandaging my leg on one side, and I was shouting at him on the other: \"Hand over control!\" During this time, Bradley saw where the minefield was and drove into the passage. This vehicle evacuated me. So they took me out quite quickly. Then our battalion medic, friend Kylym, worked well.*\n\n>You said that two minutes before the explosion, your comrade advised you to fasten the collar of your body armor...\n\n>*When we saw the powerful remote mining going on, friend Piro said: \"Commander, let's put your collar on after all\". My kevlar collar was rolled up, and they pulled it on for me in two or three minutes. During my explosions, it was torn to shreds. I kept it because there were shrapnel in it. They were even in the turnstiles that I had on my dodgers. They were everywhere. The Kevlar collar, the attacker, the armor saved me, I survived.*\n\n>How long did the company remain in that position? What tasks did it continue to perform? And how successfully can you say?\n\n>*I am very proud of my company and the soldiers. I am most satisfied with myself because I taught them how to fight properly. I am most satisfied with the fact that I realized who would be able to command the best after me. I made the managerial decisions that were required of me. And the soldiers did not just repel counterattacks at this position, being semi-surrounded. They kept storming it... They did not lose control, did not lose their combat capability. They then stormed Real Madrid, stormed Barcelona, Robotyne. That is, they continued fighting.*\n\n>Why did you have such Spanish names for your positions - \"Benfica\", \"Real\"? \n\n>*I don't know, maybe there was a football fan in the corps. But all the positions were named after football teams. My main task was, you know what? To capture Shakhtar and Dynamo by going through Real Madrid. If you've seen the video of the enemy company dying in four minutes, this is exactly the Dynamo position. So I'm very proud of my company, they are handsome. But a lot of losses could have been avoided if they had not formally followed orders. [...]* [Part 2/3]",

During company and battalion tactical exercises, we constantly used this, entering the rear through the landings (the Americans played the role of the Russians). I was proud of my guys, who actually walked six to eight kilometers through the forest, exposing enemy observation posts. It was very interesting. Each company commander had an American company commander next to him, and you had to ask him questions. If you were not shy, everything was explained to you. I was always asking questions. My &quot;Capt. Jack&quot;... He even twitched his eye, but until I fully understood the task, I did not leave him. We often spent the night on those towers, and he was explaining to me for the twentieth time how to use the Bradley correctly. Again, there were people who had fought in the Gulf, and they explained how they countered tanks there. It was all very interesting. Basically, I tortured everyone very hard. I had Chris next to me, who is now dead... He spoke very good English, and the two of us were constantly beating the Americans to understand everything. I think the problem with several companies of the brigade, the officers of the brigade, was that instead of kicking their instructors&#39; asses, they went to bed. This is my opinion.</em></p>\n\n<p>When did you arrive in the area of responsibility and receive your assignment? When did you get the order to go on the assault?</p>\n\n<p><em>At first, we were redeployed to Zaporizhzhia region, to the south, in mid-May. There was already a corps planning meeting, and all company commanders were invited to attend. There, they began to explain to us what would happen next. That is, in May, I understood perfectly well what I had to do, I understood the task of my company. I gathered platoon commanders and section commanders and began to explain their actions to everyone. We were even able to model the positions we had to storm, and every night we practiced, practiced, practiced... We strained all our financial resources, bought night vision devices, because we lacked them, even though we were better equipped than other brigades. There was a very strong kinship. Each soldier understood his task, each could clearly say what he was doing at each stage.</em></p>\n\n<p>And the burden of responsibility, that the whole country was watching you, that you would reach Mariupol and we would win... Didn&#39;t it put pressure on you?</p>\n\n<p><em>Listen, I&#39;ve been in this life for a long time... I understand what a pretentious choss is. And I understand that what is planned can go wrong. And I told my soldiers a simple thing: it will be difficult, and then you will not fight for Ukraine - you will fight for each other, for the one on the right, on the left, behind, in front. And I will fight for you as long as I am able. And I explained quite calmly: after me, my friend Lys (Yevtushenko Dmitry Sanych) is in charge, the best officer I have ever seen. Honestly, I think he has very great prospects. Dmytro Sanych falls out - his friend Chris (Rest in Peace) follows him, Chris falls out - the Professor (Rest in Peace), he falls out - another commander... Everyone in the company understood the transfer of control of platoons, everyone understood the transfer of control of squads. Yes, this was due to a certain misunderstanding on the part of the soldiers: what else do you want from us? We&#39;ve been studying for nine months, we&#39;ve been winding turnstiles with our eyes closed... What else do you want?</em></p>\n\n<p>When was the first assault you went on? What was your first experience?</p>\n\n<p><em>The first experience was that we were late for the assault... According to the plan, we were supposed to assault right after the 3rd Battalion. But because of the failures in planning, we were, to put it mildly, three hours late, so, of course, we could not help. It was already morning, and it was very difficult to fight the Russians during the day because of their superiority in artillery, aviation, and UAVs. So we started to clarify the tasks before landing. They were adjusted based on the experience of the 3rd Battalion. Now we had to walk not 12 kilometers, but only 6. But from what we had already heard from the 3rd Battalion and others... You know, the Army is a big collective farm, everyone started asking each other: what, how, where? When I heard what happened, I explained to the platoon and section commanders their tasks and promised the barrier units that we would cover them as long as the Bushmasters were firing. And so it happened. We covered them, they did their job, and we still managed to capture certain positions, repel counterattacks and, in principle, prepare for defense. The Russians were not able to knock us out with counterattacks.</em></p>\n\n<p>What date did this happen?</p>\n\n<p><em>June 9. We seized the positions, repelled the first counterattack, and began to dig in. I was wounded, and my friend Lys took over the command, and he continued to lead the company, and he led it quite well. We accomplished our task with minimal losses.\n When other companies already had &quot;two hundredths&quot; [KIAs], most of the equipment was damaged, I had only ten &quot;three hundredths&quot; [WIAs]. The dead came after I had fallen. But there were objective reasons for that, because the Russian artillery simply mixed our positions with the black soil.</em></p>\n\n<p>How did you get blown up, what was it like?</p>\n\n<p><em>How... We called the Bradley, which was supposed to evacuate the first wounded. I saw that it was about to drive across the minefield, jumped out of the landing and started waving my hands where to go. I heard shots, saw my leg fly off, was surprised... Most likely, it was a large-caliber machine gun, because there were tanks on the enemy&#39;s &quot;Real Madrid&quot; position, and they were working. I started jumping on my left leg, stepped on an anti-personnel mine, and fell on my back. Apparently, the &quot;petal&quot; [PFM-1 mine] worked, because during the period when we captured and repelled the first attack, there was a massive remote mining. Every ten meters in the sky there was an explosion, explosion, explosion... The sky turned pitch-black, I&#39;ve never seen anything like it in movies. The detonation went off, and I turned over on my stomach. Something also went off under my chest, and I was thrown again. I have good armor, so the blast wave went through my arms. After all these explosions, I fell down, lying down and looking around: my hands were burned. I realize that I can&#39;t do anything for myself now. But my friend Piro was next to me, and I called out, &quot;Piro, help!&quot; Piro ran across the minefield to save me. And he did. In a minute or two, he put four tourniquets on me, somehow tied my leg with paracord and pulled me out.</em></p>\n\n<p>Was the leg there? I mean, did they try to save the severed leg?</p>\n\n<p><em>It was hanging on to a piece of muscle, dangling. While this was happening, I was shouting at him to radio about the injury, to hand over control. I don&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t lose consciousness. Until I heard that everyone understood about the transfer of control, I didn&#39;t calm down, I was beating him up. He was bandaging my leg on one side, and I was shouting at him on the other: &quot;Hand over control!&quot; During this time, Bradley saw where the minefield was and drove into the passage. This vehicle evacuated me. So they took me out quite quickly. Then our battalion medic, friend Kylym, worked well.</em></p>\n\n<p>You said that two minutes before the explosion, your comrade advised you to fasten the collar of your body armor...</p>\n\n<p><em>When we saw the powerful remote mining going on, friend Piro said: &quot;Commander, let&#39;s put your collar on after all&quot;. My kevlar collar was rolled up, and they pulled it on for me in two or three minutes. During my explosions, it was torn to shreds. I kept it because there were shrapnel in it. They were even in the turnstiles that I had on my dodgers. They were everywhere. The Kevlar collar, the attacker, the armor saved me, I survived.</em></p>\n\n<p>How long did the company remain in that position? What tasks did it continue to perform? And how successfully can you say?</p>\n\n<p><em>I am very proud of my company and the soldiers. I am most satisfied with myself because I taught them how to fight properly. I am most satisfied with the fact that I realized who would be able to command the best after me. I made the managerial decisions that were required of me. And the soldiers did not just repel counterattacks at this position, being semi-surrounded. They kept storming it... They did not lose control, did not lose their combat capability. They then stormed Real Madrid, stormed Barcelona, Robotyne. That is, they continued fighting.</em></p>\n\n<p>Why did you have such Spanish names for your positions - &quot;Benfica&quot;, &quot;Real&quot;? </p>\n\n<p><em>I don&#39;t know, maybe there was a football fan in the corps. But all the positions were named after football teams. My main task was, you know what? To capture Shakhtar and Dynamo by going through Real Madrid. If you&#39;ve seen the video of the enemy company dying in four minutes, this is exactly the Dynamo position. So I&#39;m very proud of my company, they are handsome. But a lot of losses could have been avoided if they had not formally followed orders. [...]</em> [Part 2/3]</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

There were times when we had to hit the positions, but they said no: \"Paladin is an expensive shell\"... People died because of this. Because they had to work with artillery, but they did not for some unknown reason. And because of that, my guys were dying.*\n\n>How long did you fight for Robotyne? I think you've been following this closely.\n\n>*Wait a minute: the task of taking Robotyne was set on the first day. That is, the fighting for Robotyne lasted from June 8 until it was taken.*\n\n>Your guys went there too.\n\n>*Of course they did. They went in, made ambushes, and practiced very well. Our 4th Company, despite everything, kept moving forward with clenched teeth. Despite the losses and wounded. Many of my fighters have five concussions. My friend Fayer was wounded numerous times during this offensive and kept coming back. Well, now he is unwound normally, he will rest for a long time. Three injuries in the battle for Robotyne alone... And so many others.*\n\n>Obviously, the Russians were preparing for assaults in this area. They were not afraid of the Leopards and did not run away as expected.\n\n>*The whole plan of the great counteroffensive was based on simple things: a Muscovite sees a Bradley, a Leopard, and runs away. That was it. \"Guys, you're going to unwind them there!\" But the Bradley has no active defense! \"Don't piss off! It's good enough as it is.\" And the tankers had never fired from the Leopard! \"Don't piss me off, they worked on T-72s!\" Despite the fact that all the guys were awesome, I just fell in love with our tankers.*\n\n>Some tanker accidentally stuck to you...\n\n>*It was a rocket bomb! The T-64 on the trawls [with mine plow] had to work with another company. But then there was a certain managerial mess. I was given a T-64, and I worked with it, got into the swing of things. When it comes to storming, they take it away from me and give me other guys who I see for the first time in my life and who do not understand the task, they are just furious that they are here. And they were \"triggered\", it seems, in the first minutes of the battle from the ATGM. We continue to fight, roll back, roll up, continue to maneuver. And then I get a call on the radio: \"Friend Fritz, what should I do?\" I said: \"Who is this?\" - \"I'm so-and-so,\" - I realize that this is a tanker who should be with another unit. \"So you're supposed to be...\" - \"No way, I'm with you, I'm tailing you...\" - \"My baby!\" - I was happy. - \"Well, now we're going to get things going! There's the first platoon, go around, get ready\". Certain elements of randomness, which were related to the fact that some decisions of senior commanders were not logical in this particular situation, only confused. But thanks to this confusion, I ended up with another Teshka [T-64?] on the trawl, which paved the way for me to get to the Benfica position. And why did they do that - because, in principle, the UR [demining] team had worked on this position before, in the first minutes of the battle. We managed to do it, and we just needed a tank to pass through and make another passage so that the infantry would not be blown up. It was like a TV series.*\n\n>Is war always chaos?\n\n>*Controlled chaos! The main thing here is, firstly, not to go crazy, and secondly, to understand your position in this chaos. And to try to subordinate it to a common goal and purpose in one way or another. Yes, it was chaos. Because of this chaos, some companies ran out of supplies in 15 minutes, others - in 30 minutes, other brigades even set \"records\". My company did not run out, we had minimal losses. Yes, there were vehicles hit. I was the first to be hit, the 152mm hit me...*\n\n>And the Bradley...\n\n> *... The Bradley withstood everything. The shell hit the starboard side, and the track was damaged. The armor withstood the debris, but the shock wave tore the wiring in the vehicle... The only time the Bradley failed to withstand the attack was when helicopters were working, a week later. A Ka-52 hit the vehicles, and one Bradley detonated. But there are cases when they did not detonate, when they withstood such strikes. In principle, this is a very reliable vehicle. This is not a BMP-2, where the entire crew dies, no. The Bradley can be hit, but the crew survives. And the engine is always running. The mechanic-driver wakes up from the concussion, the engine is still running, and we continue driving. Yes, it is chaos. In this chaos, it is important not to lose contact with the senior commander. Because you need artillery, you need current orders. And when this stops happening, when the battalion sergeant passes on the commander's orders to you, it's not good. Because you did not hear the order to transfer control to the sergeant. And you can definitely hear in the radio that it is not your commander speaking. Again, it is very important that senior commanders understand what is happening on the battlefield. You know, the command and control system in the 47th was so good that I could see where each of my vehicles was on my tablet. This helped in management, you understood who was where. The brigadier understood who was where, and the commander understood. The only thing they did not understand was what was really happening on the battlefield. And the situation was quite simple: ATGMs in every position. The Russians knew our routes of advance, and everything was flying along these routes - 152s, 120s, and Grads... And here you are, and where are you going to maneuver? Only back and forth, because everything else is mined. And we are the ones who did it.*\n\n>You've been undergoing treatment for five months now, and you're recovering. What's the situation with your left leg - is it also very seriously injured?\n\n>*Yes, it is. The \"anti-personnel\" worked. Unfortunately, due to the fact that my wounds were not treated well enough in Zaporizhzhia, the process of festering began, and I had to cut off half of my foot, although it basically held up. There were numerous fractures of the metatarsals, but I still have a foot... Due to the large influx of wounded, doctors simply did not have enough time to clean the wounds properly. I was cleaned for the first time in Dnipro, two days later, when the process of festering began and the issue of amputation of my left leg was raised. But I did not let it happen, and the doctors, thank God, helped me. My leg was saved, but not in full. Well, it's okay, I'm training.*\n\n>It took a long time for your arms to recover, so you could not transplant yourself...\n\n>*I could not do anything with them. My arms were torn by the blast wave, but they stitched them up here and stitched them up there, so I'm fine... I can already grab the bar to do pull-ups. We have good surgeons, they do a good job of assembling everything. So now everything is fine. But in the first days it was, of course, hard. You're lying there, tied up, your hands are burned, a tube in your mouth, and you have only one thought: whether your balls have been blown off or not... (laughs.) Thank God, I checked with the nurses, and they said everything was fine.*\n\n>Not so long ago, you stood on your leg for the first time. How did it feel? How much did it hurt?\n\n>*It hurts a lot! Because I had a muscle transplant on my foot, and they have not healed enough yet. But in general, everything is fine, I just need a little more time. I'm lucky because here at the clinic, I have a trainer who is very pitiful. I tell him: \"Don't you dare feel sorry for me!\" and he's a handsome man: \"Here's a trapeze, here's a boot to make it easier to walk - let's go!\" It hurt, but I went. This is a very significant milestone for me. I had several of them. The first stage is when you can go to the toilet by yourself. This is very important, by the way. The second stage is that you can stand up. I stood up on August 17. And in September, I started walking on one leg with crutches. This is already not bad. I still have several surgeries to undergo: to repair my nerves and remove contractures. I have a long way to go in treatment. But I know I will go. I know that I will have a cool prosthesis, I will be a Terminator man. And everything will be fine. Once an officer I knew called me and said: \"Well, you go ahead and recover. There will be a counteroffensive next year, too\". And I told him: \"I don't have enough legs for the next counteroffensive\". - \"We have to reach Crimea!\" - \"I don't mind, but I really don't have enough limbs...\" It's not a good idea to storm the Russians' prepared positions once again. I really hope that after what happened, they drew conclusions... An offensive always means losses. Still, I would like to see better interaction between the branches of the armed forces, to have aviation, to not be afraid of helicopters, to have the means to counter them. I really wish there were personnel conclusions.*\n\n>Do you still want to return to the Army? What do you think about it?\n\n>*I don't think there is a single person who wants to go back to the Army. But... We all want to continue to defend Ukraine. Are you asking if I want to go back to the Army? No, I don't. Not at all. I don't get enough sleep there. Will I return to defend Ukraine? Yes, I will. In what condition, in what position - I'm not ready to answer. Because I probably won't be able to storm the landings.*\n\n>Why do you have the call sign Fritz?\n\n>*Oh... My friend Halychanyn first called me Fritz in 2016. And it stuck. I have never hidden the fact that I am half German. You know, I have a family of \"anti-Soviet\" people: some were in the Hitler Youth, others in the UPA. And they all met in Siberia, and my mother was born from this love. That's how it happened. In principle, I am quite boring and methodical when it comes to doing something. I think I live up to my nickname somewhere.* [Part 3/3]",

In what condition, in what position - I&#39;m not ready to answer. Because I probably won&#39;t be able to storm the landings.</em></p>\n\n<p>Why do you have the call sign Fritz?</p>\n\n<p><em>Oh... My friend Halychanyn first called me Fritz in 2016. And it stuck. I have never hidden the fact that I am half German. You know, I have a family of &quot;anti-Soviet&quot; people: some were in the Hitler Youth, others in the UPA. And they all met in Siberia, and my mother was born from this love. That&#39;s how it happened. In principle, I am quite boring and methodical when it comes to doing something. I think I live up to my nickname somewhere.</em> [Part 3/3]</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

What happens when someone says the Russians aren&#39;t as weak as they need to be in order for the strategic plan to work? </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s the same thing that happened with the Russians during the invasion. Or for that matter, it personifies A Bridge Too Far, ie OP Market Garden. </p>\n\n<p>Poor assumptions, underestimating the enemy, and Group Think at the political strategic level meant the UAF had no other choice but to shit out a very bad plan. Either a bunch of tactical commanders and the various intelligence chiefs mutiny and tell Zelensky and Zaluzhny that they&#39;re idiots who are out of their minds, or they shut up and do their jobs and accept the optimistic assessment and hope for the best. </p>\n\n<p>.</p>\n</div>",

I think US Army active duty armored brigades would have done badly following that plan.\n\nThat said, western trained Ukrainian units were largely set up for failure. \n\nTake the 47th, who had it better than all the others because they actually existed in 2022 (they went from a battalion, to separate regiment, to brigade over the course of six months, not having fought since they were a battalion in the summer of 2022). Most of the other brigades didn't even get fully staffed until Feb-Apr '23 for an offensive that was supposed to start in May but ended up starting in June. \n\nFor the 47th, who had it better than anyone else, even supposedly got to pick their own troops, a lot of the junior enlisted troops and junior officers were barely trained, having attended either Ukrainian basic training or one of the foreign ones. All of that training is 3-5 weeks, basic infantry focused. I'm sure there is specialized training to some degree for non-infantry jobs but I'm not sure how it's done, if it's standardized, etc. So at the individual skill level, it wouldn't be great.\n\nThen as a formed brigade they got sent to Germany for five weeks for combined arms training, to essentially practice the collective training tasks they'd need to do during their upcoming campaign, the combined arms breaching, assault, and maneuver fighting aspects of their offensive role. Then they went back to Ukraine, apparently trained some more. But that training should have lasted a year or so, not six months (which includes lots of traveling and various other time-wasters). Too short, not high quality, not realistic, etc. \n\nAnd it didn't seem to include much training at the high tactical levels. As in maneuvering multiple battalions or brigades at a time. And based on what other reports have said, pretty much all the training was focused on battalion level ops. Who trained the battalion commander and his staff? More so, who trained the brigade commander and his staff? \n\nRecently, Michael Kofman and Jack Watling of RUSI did a podcast together where both talked about their separate experiences on research trips to different units in Ukraine. Their takeaway? \n\nI'm paraphrasing, but Ukrainians suck big time at battalion and above operations, especially brigade. Battalion staffs are tiny, so most of the planning is done at the brigade level. As a rule the brigade commanders micromanage offensive operations, skipping the battalion headquarters level altogether to give instructions to companies. But then complain that they can't simultaneously command more than 2-3 companies at a time because they become overextended. No shit, that's literally why the battalion level exist.\n\nExisting veteran UAF brigades who were already pretty experienced doing offensive operations might not have had those problems. Considering the UAF was not an offensively focused army before this war, I can't imagine they knew what they were doing. So they were themselves probably equally clueless when the war started, but worked out many of the kinks in previous offensive ops, especially Kharkiv, which required them to use all their battalions at once. But those brigades got burned up in Bakhmut, and relegated to supporting ops in the East for this strategic offensive.\n\nEven more so, who trained the Tavria operational level commander and his staff? Tarnavskyi, who took over the Kherson Bridgehead operation midway through when they fired the previous commander for lack of progress, and then commanded this offensive, might know what he's doing based on Kherson. But maybe not, the UAF successes in Kherson had more to do with the Russian nightmare strategic situation necessitating a retreat than anything Tarnavskyi did. \n\nConsidering that mines and defenses in depth were such a big problem in Kherson you'd think THE SAME COMMANDER would apply the lessons learned there or try to find solutions when doing something more grandiose. But alas. So there is a pretty good chance that either he was being micromanaged from Kyiv and actually had no control.

The one thing that sticks in the Dem's bonnet is that its a tiered shutdown bill.

Only in Feb will serious spending problems develop re: general spending. So Dems fear, probably correctly, that this gets Reps through the pain of the Holidays where the Gov really ought to stay open, then lets them shut down Dem priorities for almost a month before Republicans get serious about negotiating a new spending bill. Thats... not ideal, and I could see there being trouble with this in the Senate. But ultimately this is, IMO, probably the best offer the Senate can hope for short of a conference bill compromise miracle (which sometimes does happen!). Republicans have the upper hand in that they've disrupted the 'cant govern' narrative by cranking out a rather moderate bill, and now if Dems futz over details itll look like *they* want a shutdown. As a result I just dont see this really being blocked, and well have another fight come up early next year. \n\nAs for Ukraine, there is no (AFAIK) Ukraine spending in this bill which remains its own separate thing. Ditto for Israel. I personally am a little surprised that these bills weren't linked, I had predicted before that they would be. Remains to be seen how the Senate will handle all this. In the US system both chambers get to take their own crack at spending bills, in *normal* order all this can be sorted out in conference between the chambers and revoted on. But who knows with this political alignment. Regardless, I would see this actually as a bad sign for Ukraine going forward if a 'clean'-ish CR gets through. First there is a high likelihood of a partial shutdown in Jan with the current House plan. Not great conditions to pass a Ukraine aid bill. Second, the politics of the budget arn't going to change. As a result Johnson needs to provide a win for the more conservative, anti-Ukraine, wing of his party. I dont think the Ukraine bill gets watered down in terms of aid, but I do suspect it'll have a ton of the conservative wishes stuffed into it. Particularly over the Israel bill, which might have a better shot of squeaking through clean. \n\nOf course the Senate wont stand for these games, particularly after a bloody budget fight. So I would suspect the Senate will try to 'jam up' the House by passing its own bill first and forcing the House to try and mess it up. If you get a clean Ukraine bill through the Senate with a filibuster proof bipartisan majority (likely, given McConnell will whip in favor of such a bill) I dont know that a *sane* house can just reject that or insert into it their own bullshit. Problem is this is not likely to be a -this year- solution. Maybe, I could be wrong and we are in a quasi-lame duck sort of place. But I suspect that Ukraine and Israel are going to be on the backburner until after the Feb budget showdown. \n\nThis is just my reading of the politics of course, the big X factor is Johnson. Lot of the media has been dunking on him for being unproven and (without evidence) feckless. Him getting out the bill he has has been savvy. Perhaps, in a surprise of surprises, he actually turns out to be a pretty competent dealer. We just don't know. Helping him, however, is that his party is probably not really interested in getting into *another* brutal civil war this time in an election year. I think quietly he may have the 'put up or shut up' mandate. Of course hes an X factor, and maybe he *personally* dislikes Ukraine aid and so wont fight for it. Its just hard to know right now.

While White House officials and Democrats grumbled that the \u201cgoofy\u201d two-tiered system increased the chance of shutdowns in the future because it kicks the can again \u2014 with two deadlines, to boot.

Stabenow speculated the two deadlines were included \u201cso the speaker could tell his most extreme members that they would have other opportunities to cause problems.\u201d\n\n>Biden administration officials acknowledged the bill is not what they would have proposed, but it keeps the government open and averts spending cuts, according to an administration official granted anonymity to discuss strategy. Yet, the White House was also not eager to come out strongly for a bill that didn\u2019t contain its defense supplemental priorities, the official added, saying that a strong show of support from Biden also could have risked passage in the House by galvanizing Republicans against it.\n\n>In the end, only two House Democrats opposed the bill, a point of unity that pleased the White House, particularly as the vote sharply divided House Republicans.

The White House did not even issue a Statement of Administration Policy on the bill declaring what action the president would be advised to take on the measure.

Schumer said he and the White House agreed \u201cthat if this can avoid a shutdown, it\u2019ll be a good thing.\u201d\n\n>The fast-moving legislation and lack of clear direction from the White House led to some uncertainty about the bill\u2019s fate.\n\n>\u201cMy guess is that the White House doesn\u2019t like this. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s changed. But if it ends up getting a bunch of Democratic votes in the House and the Senate, I would imagine the White House is not going to veto it,\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said Tuesday morning.\n\n>Some Senate Democrats were still trying to figure out how they would vote on the measure. Sen.

But if it is a clean CR that allows us to get more time to address all these things and we\u2019re not spending the week before Thanksgiving arguing?\u201d Fetterman said. \u201cWe should never be in a place where we\u2019re arguing that it\u2019s on the table that you could shut things down.\u201d\n\n>**The question now facing Democrats and the White House is what they can do to move the president\u2019s foreign aid request forward. The next time partial government funding will run out is on Jan. 19, and there are no legislative deadlines that could prompt action before then.**\n\n>**Republican Ukraine supporters expressed little concern about kicking the can. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate now has \u201cJanuary and into February to get the job done, and that\u2019s what we hope to be able to accomplish.\u201d**\n\n>**Sen.

Conservative opposition to funding Ukraine has grown deeper and Republicans have inextricably linked border policy with Ukraine \u2014 a move that\u2019s setting up tough negotiations.**\n\n>On Tuesday, Democrats, however, said they felt they were playing the hand they were dealt as best as they could.\n\n>\u201cWe\u2019re living in a world of crazy,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cAt some point, you have to cut weird deals with arsonists.

I don\u2019t think that\u2019s changed. But if it ends up getting a bunch of Democratic votes in the House and the Senate, I would imagine the White House is not going to veto it,\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said Tuesday morning.</p>\n\n<p>Some Senate Democrats were still trying to figure out how they would vote on the measure. Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) said he was \u201cinclined\u201d to support the bill when it came to the Senate.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cObviously I would be concerned given where it\u2019s coming from [in the House]. But if it is a clean CR that allows us to get more time to address all these things and we\u2019re not spending the week before Thanksgiving arguing?\u201d Fetterman said. \u201cWe should never be in a place where we\u2019re arguing that it\u2019s on the table that you could shut things down.\u201d</p>\n\n<p><strong>The question now facing Democrats and the White House is what they can do to move the president\u2019s foreign aid request forward. The next time partial government funding will run out is on Jan. 19, and there are no legislative deadlines that could prompt action before then.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Republican Ukraine supporters expressed little concern about kicking the can. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate now has \u201cJanuary and into February to get the job done, and that\u2019s what we hope to be able to accomplish.\u201d</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) expressed even more optimism: \u201cWe hope to get it all done by the end of the year.\u201d</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>A White House official said the administration and Democratic leaders made clear to Republicans how much they prioritize the defense supplemental.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Schumer, for his part, indicated the Senate would address the defense supplemental shortly after the chamber returns from Thanksgiving.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>But the bill still faces the same tough politics. Conservative opposition to funding Ukraine has grown deeper and Republicans have inextricably linked border policy with Ukraine \u2014 a move that\u2019s setting up tough negotiations.</strong></p>\n\n<p>On Tuesday, Democrats, however, said they felt they were playing the hand they were dealt as best as they could.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re living in a world of crazy,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cAt some point, you have to cut weird deals with arsonists. And that\u2019s where we are.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Beijing is already facing uncertainty next year from its own economic downturn, while the world must also deal with the US election, and wars in Europe and the Middle East, he added.\n\n>Xi is seeking to build a \u201cworld-class force\u201d by 2027, a deadline that coincides with the 100th anniversary of the PLA. Mark Milley, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said last year Beijing\u2019s military won\u2019t be ready to invade Taiwan for \u201csome time.\u201d His successor, Charles Q. Brown Jr., said last week he doubts Beijing plans to try to take Taiwan militarily.\n\n>Taiwan is separated from China by more than 100 miles (160 kilometers) of ocean, and its rugged coastline would make an amphibious invasion challenging. While China has the world\u2019s largest navy by number of warships, its forces are largely untested.\n\n>Koo said Taiwan would use mobile weapons such as anti-ship missiles, Himars rocket systems, drones and Javelin anti-tank systems to make China\u2019s landing operations more difficult in the event of an invasion. The US will bring forward a Himars shipment by one year to 2026.\n\n>Earlier this month, Koo said the US government is taking steps to speed up the delivery of American weapons systems to Taiwan that have been delayed by factors including shipments to Ukraine.\n\n> US President Joe Biden is expected to touch on Taiwan when he meets with Xi this week at a leaders\u2019 summit in San Francisco. Biden has repeatedly vowed to defend Taiwan from any Chinese invasion, in comments that have angered Beijing and brought new uncertainty to Washington\u2019s longstanding policy of \u201cstrategic ambiguity\u201d over the island.\n\n\n>Koo said Taipei and the US are discussing a possible meeting between Biden and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. founder Morris Chang at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, where he is Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen\u2019s special envoy. At last year\u2019s conference, Chang had a brief chat with Xi that didn\u2019t touch on Taiwan Strait tensions.\n\n\n>Taiwan\u2019s security cooperation with the US remains close, he said, with Washington pushing Taipei on defense reform, whole-society resilience and the construction of asymmetric warfare capabilities.\n\n>\u201cThe US has a stronger sense of urgency than Taiwan,\u201d Koo said.",

There's no reason that US SSGNs can't launch 300-400 tomahawks from 500km offshore at Chinese infrastructure.\n\n\nThe better question is what does the US give up to do this. Launching these strikes is useful, but will deplete the US precision strike inventory very quickly, and may mean that they arent hitting targets that are needed on the battlefield.\n\n\nEdit: \n\nHeavy industry is not exactly what will bottleneck Chinese production. \n\n\nYou'd probably have more success hitting chip production, rail transport interchanges, parts of the Chinese electrical grid, or Chinese oil refineries.\n\n\nChip production: China has (from what I can find) less than 100 large scale semiconductor fabs. Hitting these with even a single missile would take them off line for months, and really increase the reliance of China on imported components for production. Since most othet significant fabs lie in countries friendly to the US, it would be difficult for China to substitute imports for domestic production. That also ignores the fact that China relies on foreign components to build these fabs, so once they're destroyed, they may be gone for good. \n\n\nOil refineries: China has about 34 refineries of 200,000 bpd or more production. These 34 refineries account for about 60% of Chinas refining capacity. 300-400 missiles would absolutely shatter these, and leave China with huge questions about how to refine crude oil into useful distillates.\n\n\nI don't know enough about the Chinese rail or electrical grid to comment on those.",

Since China has 50 AWACS I wouldnt assume that they'd be launching from 500km out any more. I'd assume either a mid range launch (in the 50-100km range from the coastline) to reduce reaction time, or a short range launch (10km from coastline) to possibly sit inside of the AWACS patrol envelope.  Either way you get a much lower likelihood of interception but this obviously increases the risk to the launch platform.\n\n\n> because after the vk's sead campaign ended and ukraine had time to re-organize, ukraine was managing to down 50-60% of incoming cruise missiles total. 50-60% was june 2022, so they were doing this back when russia was still shooting a fairly large number of missiles, and when western air defenses were not on the job yet.\n\n\nYeah, good point, but the average Russian cruise missile salvo was 4-12 cruise missiles during March - June, and they averaged about 24 per day over the whole of Ukraine during the opening phases of the war. It was only when salvo size and launch rate slowed down in June that interceptions began to rise. \n\n\nA salvo of 300-400 missiles is a whole different ball game for interception compared to 4-12 missiles. At that point you're likely achieving overmatch against local missile defences through sheer volume. I think that given that this is a strike from an unexpected vector, 50% attrition is probably reasonable. \n\n\n> without a u.s. air campaign to suppress china's air defenses, i would expect that china has an overwhelmingly higher interception rate, perhaps even close to 100%.\n\n\nHaha, I feel like \"Could the US run an air campaign over mainland China\" is a little out of scope for this discussion.",

They'd definitely have done way better. \n\nBut I'm not sure they would have achieved everything they wanted though, their goals were audacious to say the least. \n\nTheir overall force structure was still too small considering that Ukraine was planning to fight back. They'd have done better tactically on the ground, a lot more Ukrainian military units would have been encircled or destroyed through direct combat but the Russians would have been bloodied in the process. \n\nThe Donbas would very likely have been fully occupied. Kyiv probably would have fallen though the govt likely to get out in time.  don't think the supposed plan to link up with Transnistria in the South would have happened, even Odesa is a bit much considering they only had part of a single CAA heading that direction. Lviv and Western Ukraine would likely have held out, but I think possibly everything east of the Dnieper could have been conquered. \n\nBut I do think Russia would have been hurt bad with an insurgency in what territory they did end up occupying.\n\n>Russia's fumble of this war will be in the history books with many lessons,\n\nDefinitely a case study in horrible planning, preparedness, and assumptions. \n\nIt's still shocking it happened. It's one thing not to tell the units when the invasion would happen, but to not give them any actual previous indications it would happen, to actively tell them it wouldn't, is insane. Someone high up should be shot in the back of the head for that.\n\nThe 2003 invasion of Iraq can be a good example of an alternative. Coalition forces didn't know for sure it would happen, definitely didn't know when, or know what the actual plan was and what routes each unit would take, their objectives, etc. But they were still prepping for war, training, getting equipment ready, stockpiling logistics, etc. And it still led to strategic surprise, despite the very visible prep Saddam also pulled a Zelensky and was sure the invasion threat was a bluff. \n\nRussia could have done it too. Ukrainian intelligence was supposedly looking specifically for enabler support units to get moved close to the border because an invasion can't happen without them. Russia knew this and kept them back until a few days before, when they knew the Ukrainians couldn't react and mobilize in time. \n\nThat's likely why Zelensky finally agreed to an 11'th hour mobilization, literally only hours before the invasion, because the GUR and UAF probably presented him undeniable intelligence for the exact precursors that would happen that would mean an invasion is guaranteed.\n\nHowever the Russians went overboard with preserving OPSEC and didn't even allow anyone to really prep. And when they finally told the maneuver units, they did the worst thing imaginable and advised their army to utterly underestimate Ukraine resistance. The logistical units were utterly taken back, barely prepared for what would be an administrative road march. \n\nSame could have happened in OIF in 2003. The Bush Admin and CIA kept telling the DOD \"Don't worry, the Iraqis won't fight back, they'll welcome you as liberators,\" which actually turned out to be largely true (in the short term). But the DOD and especially CENTCOM absolutely didn't trust that intel, believed the invasion was going to be an extremely bloody fight, prepared for that alternative. They even legitimately thought they were going to get nailed by chemical weapons after crossing the Karbala Gap, hence why the entire force was in MOPP 1 until reaching Baghdad and realizing if it didn't happen yet it wasn't going to happen.",

Kyiv probably would have fallen though the govt likely to get out in time.  don&#39;t think the supposed plan to link up with Transnistria in the South would have happened, even Odesa is a bit much considering they only had part of a single CAA heading that direction. Lviv and Western Ukraine would likely have held out, but I think possibly everything east of the Dnieper could have been conquered. </p>\n\n<p>But I do think Russia would have been hurt bad with an insurgency in what territory they did end up occupying.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Russia&#39;s fumble of this war will be in the history books with many lessons,</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Definitely a case study in horrible planning, preparedness, and assumptions. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s still shocking it happened. It&#39;s one thing not to tell the units when the invasion would happen, but to not give them any actual previous indications it would happen, to actively tell them it wouldn&#39;t, is insane. Someone high up should be shot in the back of the head for that.</p>\n\n<p>The 2003 invasion of Iraq can be a good example of an alternative. Coalition forces didn&#39;t know for sure it would happen, definitely didn&#39;t know when, or know what the actual plan was and what routes each unit would take, their objectives, etc. But they were still prepping for war, training, getting equipment ready, stockpiling logistics, etc. And it still led to strategic surprise, despite the very visible prep Saddam also pulled a Zelensky and was sure the invasion threat was a bluff. </p>\n\n<p>Russia could have done it too. Ukrainian intelligence was supposedly looking specifically for enabler support units to get moved close to the border because an invasion can&#39;t happen without them. Russia knew this and kept them back until a few days before, when they knew the Ukrainians couldn&#39;t react and mobilize in time. </p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s likely why Zelensky finally agreed to an 11&#39;th hour mobilization, literally only hours before the invasion, because the GUR and UAF probably presented him undeniable intelligence for the exact precursors that would happen that would mean an invasion is guaranteed.</p>\n\n<p>However the Russians went overboard with preserving OPSEC and didn&#39;t even allow anyone to really prep. And when they finally told the maneuver units, they did the worst thing imaginable and advised their army to utterly underestimate Ukraine resistance. The logistical units were utterly taken back, barely prepared for what would be an administrative road march. </p>\n\n<p>Same could have happened in OIF in 2003. The Bush Admin and CIA kept telling the DOD &quot;Don&#39;t worry, the Iraqis won&#39;t fight back, they&#39;ll welcome you as liberators,&quot; which actually turned out to be largely true (in the short term). But the DOD and especially CENTCOM absolutely didn&#39;t trust that intel, believed the invasion was going to be an extremely bloody fight, prepared for that alternative. They even legitimately thought they were going to get nailed by chemical weapons after crossing the Karbala Gap, hence why the entire force was in MOPP 1 until reaching Baghdad and realizing if it didn&#39;t happen yet it wasn&#39;t going to happen.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "[Under siege on the Ukrainian front line of Avdiivka: \u2018Russians are more prepared for war, and to die\u2019](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-11-13/under-siege-on-the-ukrainian-front-line-of-avdiivka-russians-are-more-prepared-for-war-and-to-die.html)\n\n*Moscow\u2019s air and artillery superiority is pushing the defenders of the strategic city in Donetsk province to the limit as ammunition supplies run low*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDay breaks under the cover of fog in Ocheretyne, offering the best protection against Russian air dominance. The Ukrainian self-propelled artillery takes the opportunity to unload a hail of shells on the enemy in a barrage lasting about 20 minutes, until the sky begins to clear over this village on the Avdiivka front, in the east of the country. The skies are controlled at all times by Russian drones. Ukrainian artillery operations are kept short to avoid their positions being identified. Last Friday morning, Ukrainian guns were aimed at the most decisive sector of the battle, just under four miles away: the railway tracks connecting Avdiivka with unoccupied Ukraine.\n\nIvan plucks a few blades of dry grass and uses them to reproduce a map of the area where his men are fighting. Like all the soldiers interviewed for this article, he prefers not to give his full name. His role is to coordinate assault companies of the 47th Mechanized Brigade, one of the Ukrainian units set up with NATO weapons and training. A civil engineer by profession, Ivan spent a year in training before joining the war, including four months in Germany and Lithuania. His men are defending the railroad tracks on the northern flank of Avdiivka: the rail line is elevated, serving as a retaining wall against advancing armor, and from it infantry movement can also be slowed. \u201cIf the Russians take control of the tracks, it will be a disaster,\u201d Ivan says. Before the war, Avdiivka had more than 30,000 inhabitants. Now there are fewer than 2,000.\n\nBy disaster, this officer means that the Russians, by dominating the roads, can ensure the advance of their troops to surround Avdiivka from the north. The Russian assault is focused on the vicinity of the city\u2019s coke factory, the largest production plant for this kind of fuel in Europe. The problem is that the enemy has already punched through on a two-mile stretch of the railway line. \u201cThey don\u2019t have control; in a single day we can take and lose positions there three times. We are fighting at 30 meters,\u201d explains Ivan. \u201cThey keep coming, in platoons of 10 to 15 men. They are constantly attacking us.\u201d Russian casualties are innumerable, says Ivan, but on the Ukrainian side they are also very high: he himself has lost his entire platoon of 17 men, either dead or captured.\n\n...\n\nMilitary sources on the Zaporizhzhia front assured this newspaper last September that the 47th Brigade lost more than 30% of its strength in that battle: around 2,000 of its 5,000 soldiers. Ivan claims he saw 16 of his comrades die. \u201cBut it\u2019s worse emotionally in Avdiivka,\u201d he adds, \u201cbecause defending is harder on morale than attacking. You have to pray, sheltered in the trench for four days, the time the rotations last, that their artillery doesn\u2019t kill you, and then resist assault after assault by their infantry.\u201d\n\nRussian casualties in the siege of Avdiivka are counted in hundreds of armored vehicles and thousands of human lives. Ukrainian military propaganda accounts on social networks have shared numerous videos of the destruction caused to the invading forces, especially by the cluster munitions provided by the United States. But Ivan shakes his head in disapproval: apart from the training of their troops, he says, the Russians are superior in every way, and they have resources to spare. \u201cIf they take the railroad tracks, they will send the armor again, and if 10 vehicles come out from their second line, our artillery will hit them, yes, but four will get through and reach their destination.\u201d\n\n**Ivan underlines the main difference between the Ukrainian and Russian armies in Zaporizhzhia: his squadron surrounded a Russian position defended by professional soldiers from an airborne division. The opposing force eventually ran out of ammunition and were repeatedly urged to surrender, according to his account. The enemy blew themselves up with grenades instead**: \u201cI don\u2019t know any Ukrainians who have done this. They have a different conception of life: Russians are more prepared for war, and to die.\u201d His words coincide with statements made to The Economist by Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. His biggest mistake, Zaluzhnyi admitted, was to believe that the 150,000 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine, by his count, would be enough for the Kremlin to stop the war.\n\n...\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like in Bakhmut, they are advancing madly, like zombies, because they want to take Avdiivka, whatever it takes,\u201d says Alexander, commander of a unit operating a U.S. Paladin howitzer in the 47th Brigade. As in Bakhmut, he points out, there have been days in Avdiivka when there have been up to 300 drones in the sky. The difference is that his Paladin does not have enough ammunition: if in Bakhmut in April, and in summer in Orikhiv on the Zaporizhzhia front, **his unit fired between 100 and 150 shells a day, in Avdiivka they are only able to fire 15. According to the military veteran, the guns also lose accuracy from being used so much. In summer, his Paladin had a margin of error of seven meters over the target; now it is 70 meters.**\n\n...",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-11-13/under-siege-on-the-ukrainian-front-line-of-avdiivka-russians-are-more-prepared-for-war-and-to-die.html\">Under siege on the Ukrainian front line of Avdiivka: \u2018Russians are more prepared for war, and to die\u2019</a></p>\n\n<p><em>Moscow\u2019s air and artillery superiority is pushing the defenders of the strategic city in Donetsk province to the limit as ammunition supplies run low</em></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Day breaks under the cover of fog in Ocheretyne, offering the best protection against Russian air dominance. The Ukrainian self-propelled artillery takes the opportunity to unload a hail of shells on the enemy in a barrage lasting about 20 minutes, until the sky begins to clear over this village on the Avdiivka front, in the east of the country. The skies are controlled at all times by Russian drones. Ukrainian artillery operations are kept short to avoid their positions being identified. Last Friday morning, Ukrainian guns were aimed at the most decisive sector of the battle, just under four miles away: the railway tracks connecting Avdiivka with unoccupied Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>Ivan plucks a few blades of dry grass and uses them to reproduce a map of the area where his men are fighting. Like all the soldiers interviewed for this article, he prefers not to give his full name. His role is to coordinate assault companies of the 47th Mechanized Brigade, one of the Ukrainian units set up with NATO weapons and training. A civil engineer by profession, Ivan spent a year in training before joining the war, including four months in Germany and Lithuania. His men are defending the railroad tracks on the northern flank of Avdiivka: the rail line is elevated, serving as a retaining wall against advancing armor, and from it infantry movement can also be slowed. \u201cIf the Russians take control of the tracks, it will be a disaster,\u201d Ivan says. Before the war, Avdiivka had more than 30,000 inhabitants. Now there are fewer than 2,000.</p>\n\n<p>By disaster, this officer means that the Russians, by dominating the roads, can ensure the advance of their troops to surround Avdiivka from the north. The Russian assault is focused on the vicinity of the city\u2019s coke factory, the largest production plant for this kind of fuel in Europe. The problem is that the enemy has already punched through on a two-mile stretch of the railway line. \u201cThey don\u2019t have control; in a single day we can take and lose positions there three times. We are fighting at 30 meters,\u201d explains Ivan. \u201cThey keep coming, in platoons of 10 to 15 men. They are constantly attacking us.\u201d Russian casualties are innumerable, says Ivan, but on the Ukrainian side they are also very high: he himself has lost his entire platoon of 17 men, either dead or captured.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>Military sources on the Zaporizhzhia front assured this newspaper last September that the 47th Brigade lost more than 30% of its strength in that battle: around 2,000 of its 5,000 soldiers. Ivan claims he saw 16 of his comrades die. \u201cBut it\u2019s worse emotionally in Avdiivka,\u201d he adds, \u201cbecause defending is harder on morale than attacking. You have to pray, sheltered in the trench for four days, the time the rotations last, that their artillery doesn\u2019t kill you, and then resist assault after assault by their infantry.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Russian casualties in the siege of Avdiivka are counted in hundreds of armored vehicles and thousands of human lives. Ukrainian military propaganda accounts on social networks have shared numerous videos of the destruction caused to the invading forces, especially by the cluster munitions provided by the United States. But Ivan shakes his head in disapproval: apart from the training of their troops, he says, the Russians are superior in every way, and they have resources to spare. \u201cIf they take the railroad tracks, they will send the armor again, and if 10 vehicles come out from their second line, our artillery will hit them, yes, but four will get through and reach their destination.\u201d</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ivan underlines the main difference between the Ukrainian and Russian armies in Zaporizhzhia: his squadron surrounded a Russian position defended by professional soldiers from an airborne division. The opposing force eventually ran out of ammunition and were repeatedly urged to surrender, according to his account. The enemy blew themselves up with grenades instead</strong>: \u201cI don\u2019t know any Ukrainians who have done this. They have a different conception of life: Russians are more prepared for war, and to die.\u201d His words coincide with statements made to The Economist by Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. His biggest mistake, Zaluzhnyi admitted, was to believe that the 150,000 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine, by his count, would be enough for the Kremlin to stop the war.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s like in Bakhmut, they are advancing madly, like zombies, because they want to take Avdiivka, whatever it takes,\u201d says Alexander, commander of a unit operating a U.S. Paladin howitzer in the 47th Brigade. As in Bakhmut, he points out, there have been days in Avdiivka when there have been up to 300 drones in the sky. The difference is that his Paladin does not have enough ammunition: if in Bakhmut in April, and in summer in Orikhiv on the Zaporizhzhia front, <strong>his unit fired between 100 and 150 shells a day, in Avdiivka they are only able to fire 15. According to the military veteran, the guns also lose accuracy from being used so much. In summer, his Paladin had a margin of error of seven meters over the target; now it is 70 meters.</strong></p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n</div>",

                            "body": "TL;DR similar to how Trump is despised by the majority of the US population but still got to win because the other side was not united enough, while Trump managed to scoop up enough mixed agendas on his side.\n\nTL;DR v2 another example in the US is the evangelical (or, extreme?) Christians. Look at their measly numbers yet their overarching impact on US politics and policy. The vast majority of the US does not care for them at all, but politicians chase their votes and then need to at least somewhat follow through. So you get federal majority that is pro-choice and federal reality of ... pro-making your life much harder.\n\nDetails:\n\nThe divisions within the Israeli population are effectively exploited by savvy politicians.\n\nThis notion is not special to Israel, but the polarity that keeps increasing (see: US in the last 10 years), and the context - wherein topics in politics and security often carry critical loads (national survival, frequent attacks at home), not just \"we disagree on this\", means fracturing the Israeli population and using it to your advantage is both very effective and carries dire consequences.\n\nAdd to that, the section of the population that **is united**, at least when it comes to voting and protesting, is the orthodox jews in Israel.\n\nWhile the vast majority of Israelis do not belong to that section, and many of them have serious issues with the impact of orthodox jews on policy, orthodox jews can wield much more of the national agenda than the remaining 70-80% of the population, relative to their size. Same goes for settlers or people who support them, although they are smaller in size *but* are often supported by said orthodox jews, so same problem but worse, while your standard left / center Israeli usually sees settlers as a major issue and the general topic is often frowned upon, whether privately or not.\n\nThis means two very large effects:\n\n1. They get an oversized representation in too many discussions and decisions. Not only security decisions, but also internal (public transportation in the Sabbath, marriage, welfare for populations who are usually orthodox jews, skipping the draft to \"study the Torah\"). Every time the orthodox population gets their way in spite of everyone else, it is a thorn in everyone's side just like I imagine Americans feel when the puritan few get to dictate US policy.\n\n2. Politicians that want their support / don't mind bending their own \"ideals\" for the sake of their support, play to their wants and needs. So suddenly right wing doesn't get only the economic right and security right, they get the religious right. If you can get an extra 20-30% (and often 10-15% is enough) of the population on your side, you'll basically always win.  So whomever is willing to somewhat serve the religious interests, or at least present himself as one who would, and can manage compiling a government from such a mess, gets to be the prime minister.\n\nThis has been a problem for decades and decades now, and as more the economic, social and security tensions heat up, less and less are you likely to be able to unite the rest of the population against such interests.\n\nAt the same time, the worse it gets, the more we hope that *this time* people unite. The outrage that was expressed when people like Smotrich (and a few others) were allowed to sit in an actual government and make actual impactful decisions, was something new, at least in extent and intensity. People get more and more tired of such lunatics having a negative impact on their lives and on the nation in general, and on other peoples.\n\nThe fact that Oct 7th happened while these horrible \"politicians\" are in place, is actually quite a bad move by Hamas. It would have been *much* more effective for Hamas' agenda to execute this unforgivable horror during a more moderate government term in Israel. Hopefully the resentment towards them and the overall situation grows to point where something starts to change.\n\nThough you never know. If the vast majority of the population of a country either knew someone or knew someone who knew someone who was viciously raped / killed / kidnapped / orphaned in a single day, you'd have difficulty moderating the response to the faction responsible for it, those who supported it (see: Palestinians cheering for the paraded corpses and raped bodies, global jubilation in Muslim populations), and those with similar agendas (see: Hezbollah, PIJ, Fatah). Suddenly Israelis realized \"hey, we have basically mostly gotten used to the fact that we have active, multiple ISIS orgs within and on our borders, no more\"\n\nP.S what is true for exploiting divisions is also true for times of crisis and the ebbs and flows of society. When there is a heightened sense of lack of security (i.e more attacks at home, more casualties), politicians try to exploit that. Israel has no shortages of such bleak opportunities unfortunately. Netanyahu is nationally known to be the best career politician, and up until Oct 7th managed to maintain an image of \"strong in security\". The prevailing sentiment, at least in my perception, is that's out the window, and that he'll be out the moment this whole thing is over.\n\n\nEDIT: to add, and I am not an expert on Israeli security policy so take this with a grain of salt - there are various purposes served by expanding the settlements. Those purposes can be quite different and belong to different sections of the population in Israel, but doing so still gives you the votes vs someone who won't expand them.\n\nFor example (and I could be wrong, and I'm sure there are more I am missing):\n\n- Negotiation Positioning: Many Israelis (civilians & politicians) think that some day, at some point, there will come a time where for better or for worse, there will be some sort of peace settlement. When that time comes, you want as many chips on the table as you can muster. Settlements are some of those chips. If I have 1 settlement, I can \"trade\" dismantling that settlement for something I want out of that peace process. If I have 500 settlements, I can get much more out of that peace process, or give up on fewer things. This is especially true when many assume that whatever treaty is signed, it will be nefariously broken by some hostile action of an enemy country / non-state actor. They want to be as ready as they can. Not being ready can mean total annihilation, or something almost as bad.\n\n- Military presence ([good summation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKcARccAR_g)): Israel's geography and its original UN-defined borders, when considering the history of Arab countries and populations continuously attacking it, is a critical pain point. If you are surrounded by peaceful countries, those borders are fine. If you are surrounded by hostile countries / non-state actors, those borders are not tenable. They leave you way too exposed, leaving the entire country in significant, real risk. It is a situation wherein once the trust is sufficiently broken, it is very tricky (read: seemingly impossible) to back down without exposing your nation to a die-or-nuke situation. Military presence in the West Bank and Golan Heights significantly resolves this geographical problem. Settlements give you a good reason to maintain military presence, they give you \"facts on the ground\", and they extend the view of your intelligence org. If enemies want to attack you from there, they'll need to make their way through those villages and outposts. This is not a new concept in handling hostile populations, but it is one that is essential to Israel's security when even a peace treaty could suddenly be nullified when some non-state actor motivated by Iran / others decides to take action. All Israelis see the catch-22 in this situation (illegal to be there, too dangerous to not be there), it is a price some are willing to pay for the sake of security, and it pains me to say I can hardly fault them for it.\n\n- *sigh* Religion: I would imagine this reason is one that the least amount of Israelis identify with. Some fundamentalist morons insist Israel's borders should resemble those it at some point had in its history, before the Romans conquered and exiled most of the population. I would say the vast majority of Israelis disagree with this and sincerely do not care about that at all, but as I mentioned, you don't need the majority if you scoop a few different groups and the majority is fractured across multiple different groups all voting for different parties.\n\nPoliticians that directly or indirectly support the expansion of settlements need only to agree with one (or 0, if they are cynical) of the above, to get the support of all voters who want the settlements. I think most of the world forgets, either specifically in the Israeli context or in any foreign conflict, that the conflict they are reading about / watching in TV is *on top* of the already complex, unsolved problem of managing a country in a consistent and moral fashion. Israeli politicians are no better and no worse than US politicians, but the impact of their actions is often more tragic, or more frustrating. Now add to that that actual terror orgs and \"governments\" like Iran get to affect your national policy.",

I'll skip explaining how many many many other countries were created with one ethnicity having the vast majority and head directly into the logical fallacy. There are (at least) two ways you can end up with an \"Ethnostate\": A. You just like your ethnicity and think all the others suck. B. *Others* persecute you *because* of *your* ethnicity, so you either cease to exist, or survive by surrounding yourself by people who *won't persecute* you, which is usually people who are of your ethnicity, funny how that happens.\n\n- \"Ethnic Cleansing\" / \"Genocide\" - This is false for many reasons, but I'll skip the standard reasons and only refer to the aforementioned logical fallacy. The conflict between Jewish and Muslim settlers of the Palestine territory (Britain, Ottoman Empire) was ethnic in nature, in addition to virtually *everything* being ethnic in nature before the notion of Nation states gradually became the norm beginning in the middle of the 19th century. As the intensity increased, each group naturally gravitated towards a structure that allows it to survive. If the majority of Japan's population somehow managed to sneak into one area in Israel and started to attack the Jewish population, and for some reason Israel was not allowed to completely wipe them out or deport them, you'd have another \"open air prison\", and we'd be speaking of the \"Ethnic Cleansing\" of the Japanese people and we'd have \"pro-Japanese\" rallies.\n\nSo now we go back to the basic problem - yes, the conflict boundaries highly correlate with ethnic boundaries. Ethnicity is not the *only* reason for it but it is definitely a major player. This can happen because of one ethnicity, the other, or both.\n\nTherefore, calling it \"Ethnic Cleansing\" (i.e implying actual intent by Israel to wipe out that group of people *because* of their ethnicity and not because they wish to harm them / any other reason) requires a much higher burden of proof than you have provided here, and should not be taken seriously without such proof in this subreddit.

Beit Hanoun wasn't taken. It is being fought over and there is some progress but it's not even close to being done, maybe not even 50%.\n2. Beit Hanoun has been thus far the most fiercely defended area of all the IDF axis of advance, and probably 30-40% of Qassam videos came out of there. A large portion of IDF casualties are coming from that area.\n3. The IDF is already inside the high rises areas of Gaza, and it has encountered less resistance there than in Beit-Hanoun, his take is out of date by at least a week.\n4. Gaza doesn't actually really have lots of 'militias'. They have Hamas, PIJ, and a few teensy tiny other organizations that are completely meaningless. Hamas has spent the past 20 years consolidating control and taking away weapons and power from those that used to have them. The people defending Beit-Hanoun are...Hamas.\n\nThe dude has a pinned post from Oct 8th talking about the upcoming ground invasion\n\n>I won\u2019t go into extensive detail here, but it\u2019ll suffice to point out that if (and if my hunch is correct, when) the IDF finds itself mauled, that will shatter its carefully cultivated aura of invincibility, opening up all sorts of threats in the process.\n\nRather than go back and say that perhaps he was wrong, and the IDF didn't get mauled, he just decided that \"the real resistance hasn't even started yet\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConclusion: This guy is just another twitter jack-off that is saying stuff based on gut feeling that have little relation to reality and have very little actual analyses going on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Just noticed he also uses military Jargon wrong. Hunter killer teams, are teams that have 2 or more elements when one is designated as the hunter-They use surveillance to find the target, and the other is the killer - Uses weapons to kill the target.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>The Qassam brigades didn\u2019t even defend Beit Hanoun (not even with the hunter-killer teams they have running around), it took the IDF several weeks to seize it from Gaza City\u2019s equivalent of the Crips</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This &#39;military analyst&#39; with 1700 followers is so unaware, so out of touch with what&#39;s going on the ground, that he doesn&#39;t even know that</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Beit Hanoun wasn&#39;t taken. It is being fought over and there is some progress but it&#39;s not even close to being done, maybe not even 50%.</li>\n<li>Beit Hanoun has been thus far the most fiercely defended area of all the IDF axis of advance, and probably 30-40% of Qassam videos came out of there. A large portion of IDF casualties are coming from that area.</li>\n<li>The IDF is already inside the high rises areas of Gaza, and it has encountered less resistance there than in Beit-Hanoun, his take is out of date by at least a week.</li>\n<li>Gaza doesn&#39;t actually really have lots of &#39;militias&#39;.

Hunter killer teams, are teams that have 2 or more elements when one is designated as the hunter-They use surveillance to find the target, and the other is the killer - Uses weapons to kill the target.
