However, from the climate maps I've seen of Ukraine we can't reliably expect the mud to harden then--at least not long enough for a sustained Ukrainian offensive. Michael Kofman himself has said it's a question of when, not if, such an offensive will take place. We must maintain patience, and we must remember that Ukraine holds the long-term upper hand, but goddamn these winter months will be excruciating. I really hope Slovakia follows through on even a few MiG-29s. Even aside from the immediate benefits to the Ukrainian Air Forces, it would probably be the least escalatory way to formalize the provision of fighter aircraft from western countries.",

But in the case of Melitopol the war really hangs on it. If Ukraine manages to break to the coast, they can probably liberate all of mainland Ukraine west of it (i.e the entire Dnieper/Kherson Oblast). It would reverse almost all Russian gains except for Mariupol and Luhansk (which is also under threat). The success of this offensive is crucial for a Ukrainian victory and successfully retaining the Dnieper line would be a good basis for a Russian victory.\n\nIn Kharkiv/Kupyansk, the Russians were caught off-guard, thinking Ukraine would not have the strength to attack there simultaneously to Kherson. But the map always made sense. It just seemed difficult.\n\nIn Melitopol, I am 100% sure that Russia absolutely understand the absolute importance of that land corridor and that Ukraine will absolutely attack there. This has obviously meant that Russia should be able to prepare for that sufficiently.\n\nI personally think that \"The Battle\" is a very long and slow one and we are currently in the preparatory phase. I think Ukraine will try and \"shape the battlefield\" with long-range artillery/HIMARS strikes and partisan/SOF attacks in the area. This advance will resemble the Kherson counter-offensive which really took months upon months of grinding action.\n\nI also think that Ukraine will keep a pressure on Luhansk as well from the Svatove-Kremennaya line, so as to force Russia to deploy resources on both flanks. But Luhansk will be secondary for both sides.\n\nI would not be surprised if Ukraine does cross the Dnieper in numerous places, as a supporting attack for the Melitopol counter-offensive. All the way from Enerhodar down to Nova Kahkovka and Kherson. I would really like to see a crossing in Enerhodar though.",

This war is just a continuation of the 2014 war, and a peace now guarantees another continuation war.\n\nI see this point repeated over and over ad nauseam (although less often this days) as a justification of why Ukraine shouldn't agree to a ceasefire or peace agreement. \n\nAlthough I see where this is coming from, I don't think it's actually a good justification. I won't even go into the fact that Russia won't be able to reconstitute it's forces for a minimum of a decade (realistically, it'll never get back to it's prewar numbers of equipment), because that's already been debated before.\n\nWhat I don't see discussed is why having a temporary truce before another war is a necessarily a bad thing for Ukraine. \n\nIf the truce lasts only a few days, nothing changes for Ukraine, as Russia won't benefit at all from a few days rest.\n\n On the other hand, if the truce lasts for a decade, Ukraine will be exponentially better prepared to defend itself by the time, as that would give NATO plenty of time to train ukrainian soldiers in anything, from Abrams to F-16s.

                "body": ">or does controlling it provide some special tactical or strategic benefit I'm unaware of?\n\nThe front lines in the Donbas are no longer a salient since the Kharkiv counteroffensive removed the northern shoulder but in Donetsk oblast, south of the Donets river, the current front line runs east of Siversk to Bakhmut on high ground then curves southwest towards New York-Horlivka, etc. \n\nTo reach Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, the key cities of Donetsk oblast, the Russians need to go from the east. To get through the Siversk-Bakhmut line, if they can outflank Bakhmut and force a retreat there they can potentially move on Siversk before a perpendicular hasty defense can be set up, causing that portion of the front lines to retreat too. The next bit of defensible ground is just east of Sloviansk-Kramatorsk-Kostyantynivka, so the Russians are ever so closer.\n\nHowever, none of that factors in the present realities that the Russians aren't strong enough to do that, they can barely make incremental gains on the outskirts of Bakhmut let alone take Donetsk oblast.\n\nSo the big question is why they're doing it?\n\nMaybe Wagner dick waving, maybe Putin stubbornness, but maybe it's a fixing attack designed to force the Ukrainians to send more of their better units to hold the city for its PR value instead of using them elsewhere. Because at the end of the day, UA govt doesn't let the UAF retreat and lose territory unless it absolutely can't hold it anymore, and it's been that way since the first phase of the war.\n\nFor instance, the UAF's 93rd Mech Infantry brigade, one of their most capable offensive maneuver unit, was sent to reinforce the city's defenses in late October early November. That's actually a pretty bold move because sending a very experienced and capable offensive maneuver unit means the potential threat of losing a lot of knowledge when casualties at the company and battalion level stack up because elite units still get chewed up when they're shoved in a meat grinder. The 93rd supposedly just got rotated out, relieved by another capable maneuver brigade, plus others that were sent to Bakhmut. Also, as of late November an artillery brigade (40th), of which the UAF only has a handful and are EXTREMELY valuable, was at least partly sent to reinforce Bakhmut with added fires.\n\nWhy does that matter?\n\nIf Russia wasn't attacking Bakhmut then it would be a quiet sector of the line and that would mean the UAF would use bare minimum forces to hold the front lines (preferably light infantry, national guard or TDF), limited mobile reserves in the rear, no heavy arty ammo allocation, no major effort on higher level staff work, etc. And all of that would be used to support the operational area's main effort operation, attacking the Svatove-Kreminna line to try to break deeper into Luhansk and potentially begin an major flanking operation to bypass the Donbas industrial zone cities to liberate most of Luhansk oblast the easier way. Which is Russia's greatest threat.\n\nSuddenly the Bakhmut attack doesn't seem so stupid, especially if Russians casualties aren't actually as high as \"Russia orc human wave assault lol stupid\" reporting makes a point to emphasize Their casualties can still be high but worth it, especially since the Russians are notoriously ruthless when it comes to accepting high casualties if they think the operation has value. A fixing action in Bakhmut has value.",

To get through the Siversk-Bakhmut line, if they can outflank Bakhmut and force a retreat there they can potentially move on Siversk before a perpendicular hasty defense can be set up, causing that portion of the front lines to retreat too. The next bit of defensible ground is just east of Sloviansk-Kramatorsk-Kostyantynivka, so the Russians are ever so closer.</p>\n\n<p>However, none of that factors in the present realities that the Russians aren&#39;t strong enough to do that, they can barely make incremental gains on the outskirts of Bakhmut let alone take Donetsk oblast.</p>\n\n<p>So the big question is why they&#39;re doing it?</p>\n\n<p>Maybe Wagner dick waving, maybe Putin stubbornness, but maybe it&#39;s a fixing attack designed to force the Ukrainians to send more of their better units to hold the city for its PR value instead of using them elsewhere. Because at the end of the day, UA govt doesn&#39;t let the UAF retreat and lose territory unless it absolutely can&#39;t hold it anymore, and it&#39;s been that way since the first phase of the war.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, the UAF&#39;s 93rd Mech Infantry brigade, one of their most capable offensive maneuver unit, was sent to reinforce the city&#39;s defenses in late October early November. That&#39;s actually a pretty bold move because sending a very experienced and capable offensive maneuver unit means the potential threat of losing a lot of knowledge when casualties at the company and battalion level stack up because elite units still get chewed up when they&#39;re shoved in a meat grinder. The 93rd supposedly just got rotated out, relieved by another capable maneuver brigade, plus others that were sent to Bakhmut. Also, as of late November an artillery brigade (40th), of which the UAF only has a handful and are EXTREMELY valuable, was at least partly sent to reinforce Bakhmut with added fires.</p>\n\n<p>Why does that matter?</p>\n\n<p>If Russia wasn&#39;t attacking Bakhmut then it would be a quiet sector of the line and that would mean the UAF would use bare minimum forces to hold the front lines (preferably light infantry, national guard or TDF), limited mobile reserves in the rear, no heavy arty ammo allocation, no major effort on higher level staff work, etc. And all of that would be used to support the operational area&#39;s main effort operation, attacking the Svatove-Kreminna line to try to break deeper into Luhansk and potentially begin an major flanking operation to bypass the Donbas industrial zone cities to liberate most of Luhansk oblast the easier way. Which is Russia&#39;s greatest threat.</p>\n\n<p>Suddenly the Bakhmut attack doesn&#39;t seem so stupid, especially if Russians casualties aren&#39;t actually as high as &quot;Russia orc human wave assault lol stupid&quot; reporting makes a point to emphasize Their casualties can still be high but worth it, especially since the Russians are notoriously ruthless when it comes to accepting high casualties if they think the operation has value. A fixing action in Bakhmut has value.</p>\n</div>",

Escalation doesn't have to be tit-for-tat. You can provoke escalation by putting your opponent into a position where escalation with all its associated risks suddenly looks like a more attractive option than not escalating.\n\nThe logic is like this - introducing ATACMS might force reevaluation of the war in Kremlin. If Putin believes that Ukraine having ATACMS puts Russia onto a losing trajectory, he has roughly two options - either continue on the losing trajectory, or change the nature of the war by escalating. The escalation option is usually risky and raises the stakes, but may look attractive enough if the alternative is an almost certain defeat.",

There are many ways the West could respond. A conventional attack might lead to an escalation spiral towards MAD. An outright nuclear attack on Russia would immediately trigger a nuclear response from Russia. If it came to that, Russia would probably get devastated much more, but the West would still suffer millions, potentially tens of millions of dead. Certainly not an easy decision to make, especially given we&#39;re talking about a proxy war.</p>\n</div>",

Seeing Russians creep closer and closer to the city made me think of how the war has evolved since the last time Russia was closing in on a city. Russia had a significant \"shadow mobilization,\" including of prisoners to Wagner, as well as an actual mobilization. There has also reportedly been a reduction in Russia's relative firepower advantage. Both of these make urban fighting less in Ukraine's favor than during the summer.

Well, it might be in practice but in theory it's entirely possible to calculate the rocket trajectories with very little residual error. For comparison, it's possible to calculate airdrop trajectories for release points at extremely high altitude (20k+ feet) with huge uncertainties around the wind forecast that are still accurate to within 100m (I can't give exact numbers but that's an upper bound). It's just basic projectile physics, and can be calculated with a straightforward numerical analysis algorithm like a Runge-Kutta fourth order method. With powered flight, the errors are even smaller because the projectile is less sensitive to wind conditions. A parachute can't go upwind if the wind speed is greater than the forward drive of the parachute, which of course does not apply to rockets which can move faster than any wind speed they can reasonably expect to encounter on planet Earth. Also parachutes descend at a much lower speed than a rocket so they are exposed to wind drift for longer periods of time, resulting in greater offset from the nominal, zero wind trajectory. \n\nThe horizontal distance traveled will be much less than a parachute system or jumper from a high altitude as well, because you don't need to start super far upwind to account for wind drift. And the wind conditions will be more predictable, because the rocket is launched at low altitude and its ballistic trajectory maxes out at relatively low altitude, which reduces the variation in wind speed and direction experienced because wind tends to be relatively consistent within an altitude band but often wildly varies at different altitudes. That in turn improves the accuracy of the calculated trajectory. \n\nThe only residual errors that would concern me for this particular case would be (1) any inconsistencies in the manufacturing process that cause variation in individual rocket's aerodynamic characteristics and (2) any issues with the pilot's user experience with the targeting software that make it easier to accidentally launch rockets from a substandard release point or velocity. Considering how tight the groupings we've seen are, I don't think (1) is really an issue, but personally I don't know enough to speak to whether (2) is.",

You&#39;re just changing your pitch at the launch point, and if you want remotely decent accuracy your targetting algorithm accounted for that anyway.</p>\n</div>",
