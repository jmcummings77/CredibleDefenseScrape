        "body": "Here we are for the second part of my analysis on the tactical situation of the front line in Ukraine and on the events of the last month, after the [first](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/1b9ndh7/comment/ktzansn/).\n\nAvdiivka sector. Firstly, the entire 90th Tank Division of the Central Military District is now in Avdiivka. Last month, its 228th Motorized Regiment and the 348th Regiment of the Territorial Forces (attached to the division) arrived from the Kreminna sector after a brief refitting, joining the rest of the division, namely the three tank regiments (6th, 80th, 239th) and the 400th Artillery Regiment. The two recently arrived regiments would be ready to go into action either in the direction of Novokalynove (along with elements of the 132nd Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps of the 8th CAA of the Southern MD) or in the direction of Berdychi. The area around Novokalynove is defended by the 71st Jager Brigade, the 1st Mech Battalion of the 1st Tank Brigade, elements of the 109th and 129th TDF Brigades and several separate rifle battalions. Around Ocheretyne there are elements of the 23rd and 31st Mech Brigades, the 2nd Mech Battalion and the 22nd Special Purpose Battalion of the Separate Presidential Brigade. Russian efforts in these two directions are minor and unsuccessful.\n\nThe 15th and 30th Motorized Brigades of the 2nd CAA of the CMD are continuing to push towards Berdychi, which is defended by the 47th Mechanized Brigade, fully deployed in the area. The 47th Brigade is putting up a tough and capable resistance, with extensive use of Abrams and Bradleys (at the cost of some losses of these vehicles). The Russians are suffering very considerable losses in the village, of which they control only the southern end, and seem unable to make further advances at the moment.\n\nFrom what I hear, the situation regarding artillery shells seems to be improving. A soldier from the 47th Brigade recently said that they have good supplies of mortar bombs. From the videos, the 3rd Assault Brigade among others makes very extensive use of DPICMs against the Russians. It\u2019s not clear to me whether these are shells donated by the US last summer or recently acquired Turkish-made shells. In addition, the use of KABs by the Russians has decreased in the recent days, after it set an all-time record on Feb. 29 (152 in one day, across the front, including 30 in Tonenke and 10 in Orlivka). About 40 KABs per day have been used along the entire front in recent days, and the decrease in KABs use is helping the Ukrainians.\n\nThe 114th Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps and the 55th Mountain Brigade of the 41st CAA of the CMD are attacking Orlivka, with support from the 24th Spetsnaz GRU Brigade. Elements of the 90th Tank Division, through detached platoons and companies, are providing support. The 74th Motorized Brigade of the 41st CAA and the 21st Motorized Brigade of the 2nd CAA are reportedly in reserve in the rear, except for smaller elements (up to one battalion per brigade) that are in combat around Orlivka. These brigades suffered greatly during the battle of Avdiivka and are probably resting while they wait for replacements of manpower and armor. \n\nThe Russians control the large majority of Orlivka today. The lines are very fluid - the same houses can change hands several times in the space of a few days. In the southern part they control the whole village up to the Zoryansky Stavok (Lake), where the Durna River flows, while in the northern part they control about a little more than half of the houses. They are still far from entering Semenivka, however (a little further north, on the other side of the Durna). Orlivka is defended by the bulk of the 3rd Assault Brigade, the 225th Separate Assault Battalion; between Orlivka and Tonenke there are elements of the 25th Airborne Brigade - at least the 3rd Battalion, transferred here from the Kreminna sector; it\u2019s unclear whether additional battalions are present. Also, from a MIA notice I found, which confirms the bulletins of the Russian MoD, in the area there is the 100th Mech Battalion of the 61st Mech Brigade, which arrived from Chernihiv Oblast.\n\nThe 35th Motorized Brigade of the 41st CAA, together with the 1st Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps, the 87th Motorized Regiment of the same corps and the 10th Tank Regiment of the 20th Motorized Division of the 8th CAA, are attacking Tonenke. Of course, there is also extensive use of the regiments of the Territorial Forces, which are used both to replenish the regular units and as additional support. For example, the 1453rd Regiment is attached to the 1st Motorized Brigade and the 1007th Regiment to the 55th Mountain Brigade. Other regiments such as the 1487th suffered huge losses during the battle of Avdiivka according to Russian sources and are now essentially out of action.\n\nTonenke is defended by the 53rd Mech Brigade. Today the Russians, as I understand it, control the vast majority of the village, except for the north-western part. After the Russians had entered the village the Ukrainians had managed to halt the attacks of the 1st Motorized Brigade (from Sjeverne), while in the last few days the 35th Motorized Brigade, attacking from Lastochkyne and Orlivka (thanks to their control of the southern part of the village) managed to conquer the forest belts north of Tonenke, which today finds itself basically encircled on three sides.\n\nThe intentions of the Russians are clear: not to give the Ukrainians time to fortify positions and to continue attacking without regard of losses, in order to reach the Ocheretyne-Umanske line as soon as possible. If north of Orlivka the Ukrainians seem to have more or less stabilized the situation, to the south the situation is more worrying. The loss of Tonenke could open the way for the Russians to the fields west of the village up to Umanske, along the southern bank of the Durna. In any case, the natural defense line in case of serious problems and further Russian advances, is that posed by the Vovcha River, and the Ukrainians are building numerous trenches and fortifications in the rear of the Avdiivka sector as we speak, making up for the poor initial situation. It must be said, however, that the Russian grouping around Avdiivka is still very strong and large. Mashovets had written in late February that this grouping, by various estimates, ranges from 60 to 80 thousand men, with about 10 thousand more in reserve; with 450 tanks, 1300 armored vehicles, 1200 artillery guns (above 100 mm) and 300 MLRS units (it should include the Horlivka and Marinka sectors, as I understand it). In addition, there is also an equipment reserve (up to 100 tanks, 220 armored vehicles, 60 artillery guns and 25 MLRS units) to allow for a fast replenishment of gear losses. \n\nThe 9th Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps (also known as the 9th Marine Brigade, i.e. the former 9th Marine Regiment, and now from Russian and Ukrainian sources is referred to as motorized) continues to push towards Pervomaiske, both from Vodyane and Pisky. Pervomaiske is defended by the 59th Motorized Brigade. There are fierce battles for each house. The Russians are particularly successful in the axis of attack from Pisky, advancing several hundred meters over the past month and approaching the center of Pervomaiske. The 110th Motorized Brigade of 1st Corps continues its attack operations around Nevelske, a little further south, advancing more than 1,5 km westwards to the south of the village along some forest belts, during the second half of February. Today they are almost at the gates of Nevelske.\n\nMarinka sector. The 5th Motorized Brigade of 1st Corps continues to push towards both Heorhiivka and Krasnohorivka. From what I have found, it recently received manpower replenishments from the 101st Motorized Regiment of 1st Corps, which covers the rather quiet area around Niu-York. At the end of February, after occupying the Trudovski mine, they made a mechanized attack towards Krasnohorivka, initially succeeding in occupying some houses in the southern end of the village. The 3rd Assault Brigade sent elements of its 1st and 2nd Assault Battalions to join the 3rd Battalion of the 80th Air Assault Brigade in defending the village, succeeding in driving the Russians out of the buildings they had occupied. \n\nHeorhiivka is defended by the 46th Airmobile Brigade, which reportedly recently drove the Russians several hundred meters back from a forest belt north-east of this village. The 103rd Motorized Regiment of the 150th Motorized Division of the 8th CAA continues to push towards Heorhiivka, advancing 1 km during late February along the O0510 Road. \n\nIn the second half of February, the Russians, specifically the 255th and the (new) 242nd Motorized Regiments of the 20th Motorized Division of the 8th CAA, with support from elements of the 163rd Tank Regiment of the 150th Motorized Division, succeeded in occupying Pobjeda, advancing almost 2 kms from Marinka. In the following days a counterattack by the Ukrainian 33rd Mech Brigade (arrived in early February from Robotyne) succeeded in halting the Russians and driving them out of the southern end of the village (with the loss of several Leopard 2A4s), which remains mostly in Russian hands. Also in the area there are elements of the 23rd Mech Brigade and probably the 2nd Battalion of the 95th Air Assault Brigade, as well as the 425th Separate Assault Battalion \"Skala\".\n\nThe 33rd Motorized Regiment of the 20th Motorized Division, with the support of the 1219th Regiment of the Territorial Forces, continues to push along the forest belts north-east of Novomykhailivka, with little progress - although if they are successful, the village risks getting surrounded on three sides.

            "body": "Novomykhailivka is being attacked by the 155th Naval Infantry Brigade of the Pacific Fleet, supported by a detachment of the 14th Spetsnaz GRU Brigade. Over the past month they have managed to penetrate more than 1,5 kilometers inside the village, from the east, with the brigade's assault detachment hoisting the brigade\u2019s flag near the Archangel Michael Church in the recent days, almost at the center of the village. In addition, elements of the 39th Motorized Brigade of the 68th Corps (EMD) have managed to (re)take control over the farms and industrial area south of the village, which is currently surrounded on two sides. The village is being defended by the 79th Air Assault Brigade, which has been doing a tremendous and underappreciated job for months and months, along with the bulk of the 116th TDF Brigade. Elements of the 111th and 124th TDF Brigades appear to have recently arrived as reinforcement for the paratroopers inside the village. \n\nIn the direction of Vodiane, the Russian attacks from Solodke lost much intensity over the past month, confirming Mashovets' assessments that the 39th Motorized Brigade was losing combat capability. In the second half of February they had to retreat more than 1 km, moving away from the Vuhledar-Kostyantynivka Road, thanks to the action of the 72nd Mech Brigade and of elements of the 31st Mech Brigade. The 39th Motorized Brigade is supported by the 139th Separate Assault Battalion of the 29th CAA (and possibly elements of the 36th Motorized Brigade of the same army \u2013 this brigade recently lost its commander during an Ukrainian missile attack in the rear) and the 1442nd Regiment of the Territorial Forces. \n\nVuhledar sector. After mid-February there was a Russian mechanized attack from Shevchenko, by the 40th Naval Infantry Brigade of the Pacific Fleet. They managed to advance northwards a few hundred meters along some forest belts but was overall repulsed by the 13th Motorized Battalion of the 58th Motorized Brigade, which has recently returned here from Avdiivka. \n\nVelyka Novosilka sector. In the eastern bank of the Mokri Yaly River, just west of Novodonetske, there were some minor attacks by the 37th Motorized Brigade of the 36th CAA (EMD), with negligible gains, repulsed by the 58th Motorized Brigade and the 3rd Mech Battalion and the 20th Special Purpose Battalion of the Separate Presidential Brigade. In the western bank, the 394th Motorized Regiment of the 127th Motorized Division of the 5th CAA (EMD) carried out attacks to the north-west of Staromaiorske, in the defense area of the 128th TDF Brigade, achieving some minor successes. Mashovets wrote that the 57th Motorized Brigade of the 5th CAA, after being withdrawn from the southern flank of Bakhmut, would be in R&R near Berdyansk. Some assault companies of this brigade are expected to join the 60th Motorized Brigade of the same army to carry out attack operations against Staromaiorske, which would be going to be attacked from the south and the west. The 1461st Regiment of the Territorial Forces and detachments of the 14th Spetsnaz GRU Brigade have also recently arrived in the area. Staromaiorske is likely defended by the 21st Brigade of the National Guard, and battalions from the 105th and 129th TDF Brigades should have recently arrived. \n\nIn addition, the 114th Motorized Regiment of the 127th Motorized Division reportedly recently carried out an attack from Marfopil in the direction of Huliaipole, capturing a few Ukrainian positions, in the defense area of the 102nd TDF Brigade.\n\nPolohy sector. Nothing to write except that the entire 35th CAA (EMD) is still deployed here.\n\nOrikhiv sector. Since mid-February, the Russians have resumed offensive operations against Robotyne and the rest of the salient. The 70th and 71st Motorized Regiments of the 42nd Motorized Division of the 58th CAA (SMD), with support from regiments of the Territorial Forces such as the 1152nd and the 1430th, attacked Robotyne from the south and the west, respectively. Unlike what several OSINT map-makers showed, in my understanding of the events, the Ukrainians never lost control over the vast trenches system (built by the Russians and occupied by the Ukrainians in September 2023) south of Robotyne. Russian attacks by the 70th Motorized Regiment with BMP-3s had just passed these fortifications, reaching the center of the village, only to be subsequently fully neutralized by the Ukrainians. The latters have been successful in completely preventing the Russians from occupying the houses inside the village and in maintaining control over the fortifications to the south, as I was writing above, although the first forest belt to the west of the T0408 Road is likely in Russian hands. Recently the 291st Motorized Regiment of the 42nd Motorized Division (which has been in R&R for months) has returned to action, with support from the 234th and 237th Air Assault Regiments of the 76th VDV Division, but no successes are reported. The 136th Motorized Brigade of the 58th CAA is deployed to the north-west of Robotyne and could carry out attacks in the near future in order to cut the T0408 Road, in the direction of Novodanylivka.\n\nRobotyne is defended, counterclockwise, by the 128th Mountain Assault Brigade, the 65th Mech Brigade, the \"Spartan\" Brigade of the National Guard and the 118th Mech Brigade. The 117th Mech Brigade is active between Robotyne and Verbove, to its right there is the 82nd Air Assault Brigade, the \"Chervona Kalyna\" Brigade, and approaching Novopokrovka, the \"Kara-Dag\" Brigade, in both cases of the National Guard; as well as, perhaps, the 78th Air Assault Regiment. Recently, as reinforcements, several battalions of the 141st Infantry Brigade have arrived, and the 116th Mech Brigade has returned to this sector from Avdiivka. The Russians claim that a battalion of the 101st TDF Brigade as well as some elements of the new 5th Tank Brigade and the new 154th Mech Brigade are arriving, but there is no evidence at all to confirm this.\n\nWhere the Russians are instead achieving success is the area east of Robotyne and around Verbove, according to two geolocations released a few days ago. The 104th Air Assault Regiment of the 76th VDV Division, after advancing about 1,5 kilometers northwards to the west of Verbove after mid-February, is descending from the heights it conquered towards the large valley that passes north-east of Robotyne, with the Russians geolocated 3 kilometers east of the eastern end of Robotyne. This is a negative development as it means that the Russians are approaching Robotyne from that direction and the village might find itself surrounded from three sides, endangering its future hold, although Robotyne enjoys elevation advantage over the valley east of it.\n\nIn addition, the 247th Air Assault Regiment of the 7th VDV Division, advancing about 1,5 km, appears to have recently been able to regain total control over the system of fortifications north-west of Verbove, which the Ukrainians had taken in early September. However, it\u2019s unclear right now whether the Russians were able to consolidate these advances or were subsequently pushed back. The Russians should have fully regained control over the first \"Surovikin line\u201d, which the Ukrainians had broken (north-west of Verbove) in late August.\n\nThe 56th and 108th Air Assault Regiments of the same division are active between Verbove and Novopokrovka, with support from the 22nd Spetsnaz GRU Brigade, but no successes have been recorded in that area.\n\nKamyanske sector. Nothing to write.\n\nKherson sector / Dnipro River. The brigades of the Ukrainian Marine Corps (35th, 36th, 37th, 38th) continue to be active in Krynky, with support from the TDF. In particular of the 126th TDF Brigade from the city of Odesa, which some Ukrainians jokingly call the 39th Marine Brigade because of its extensive involvement in the fluvial operations. The situation is extremely fluid, but it seems that the Ukrainians have been able to slightly expand the territory in their control, contrary to my expectations. The Russians, against the Ukrainian bridgehead, are employing elements of the 104th VDV Division, elements of the 70th Motorized Division of the 18th CAA (SMD), the 144th Motorized Brigade of the 40th Corps of the 18th CAA and the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade of the Black Sea Fleet. Despite this large grouping, they are, after nearly 5 months, still unable to fully clean up Krynky - and not for lack of trying - contrary to Shoigu's recent claims. In the second half of February some marines of the 810th Brigade hoisted their brigade's flag in Krynky, only to flee immediately after (they were recorded by a drone). In the following days Ukrainian marines from the 88th Battalion of the 35th Marine Brigade captured 7 paratroopers from the 337th Air Assault Regiment of the 104th VDV Division. Bombings with KABs against Krynky have decreased greatly compared to late 2023; at the moment the Russians are trying to get as close as possible to the village through the forest south-east of it, in order to set up positions for small caliber mortars, AGS-17s and SPG-9s, but their efforts inside the village are hampered by mines and especially by the high reactivity of Ukrainian artillery.\n\nFarther south, the Russians appear to have regained control over the area near the solar power plant north-west of Pidstepne, which was a gray area where there had been clashes over the recent months. Mashovets reported that the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade has recently received about 20 rigid-axis motorboats, which had arrived from Crimea to the area near Hola Prystan. In addition, a couple of companies from the 61st Naval Infantry Brigade of the Arctic Fleet would be training in river operations, with the aim of carrying out raids on the areas along the banks of the Dnipro held by the Ukrainians, such as the Bilohrudove Island.\n\nThat's all!",
            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Novomykhailivka is being attacked by the 155th Naval Infantry Brigade of the Pacific Fleet, supported by a detachment of the 14th Spetsnaz GRU Brigade. Over the past month they have managed to penetrate more than 1,5 kilometers inside the village, from the east, with the brigade&#39;s assault detachment hoisting the brigade\u2019s flag near the Archangel Michael Church in the recent days, almost at the center of the village. In addition, elements of the 39th Motorized Brigade of the 68th Corps (EMD) have managed to (re)take control over the farms and industrial area south of the village, which is currently surrounded on two sides. The village is being defended by the 79th Air Assault Brigade, which has been doing a tremendous and underappreciated job for months and months, along with the bulk of the 116th TDF Brigade. Elements of the 111th and 124th TDF Brigades appear to have recently arrived as reinforcement for the paratroopers inside the village. </p>\n\n<p>In the direction of Vodiane, the Russian attacks from Solodke lost much intensity over the past month, confirming Mashovets&#39; assessments that the 39th Motorized Brigade was losing combat capability. In the second half of February they had to retreat more than 1 km, moving away from the Vuhledar-Kostyantynivka Road, thanks to the action of the 72nd Mech Brigade and of elements of the 31st Mech Brigade. The 39th Motorized Brigade is supported by the 139th Separate Assault Battalion of the 29th CAA (and possibly elements of the 36th Motorized Brigade of the same army \u2013 this brigade recently lost its commander during an Ukrainian missile attack in the rear) and the 1442nd Regiment of the Territorial Forces. </p>\n\n<p>Vuhledar sector. After mid-February there was a Russian mechanized attack from Shevchenko, by the 40th Naval Infantry Brigade of the Pacific Fleet. They managed to advance northwards a few hundred meters along some forest belts but was overall repulsed by the 13th Motorized Battalion of the 58th Motorized Brigade, which has recently returned here from Avdiivka. </p>\n\n<p>Velyka Novosilka sector. In the eastern bank of the Mokri Yaly River, just west of Novodonetske, there were some minor attacks by the 37th Motorized Brigade of the 36th CAA (EMD), with negligible gains, repulsed by the 58th Motorized Brigade and the 3rd Mech Battalion and the 20th Special Purpose Battalion of the Separate Presidential Brigade. In the western bank, the 394th Motorized Regiment of the 127th Motorized Division of the 5th CAA (EMD) carried out attacks to the north-west of Staromaiorske, in the defense area of the 128th TDF Brigade, achieving some minor successes. Mashovets wrote that the 57th Motorized Brigade of the 5th CAA, after being withdrawn from the southern flank of Bakhmut, would be in R&amp;R near Berdyansk. Some assault companies of this brigade are expected to join the 60th Motorized Brigade of the same army to carry out attack operations against Staromaiorske, which would be going to be attacked from the south and the west. The 1461st Regiment of the Territorial Forces and detachments of the 14th Spetsnaz GRU Brigade have also recently arrived in the area. Staromaiorske is likely defended by the 21st Brigade of the National Guard, and battalions from the 105th and 129th TDF Brigades should have recently arrived. </p>\n\n<p>In addition, the 114th Motorized Regiment of the 127th Motorized Division reportedly recently carried out an attack from Marfopil in the direction of Huliaipole, capturing a few Ukrainian positions, in the defense area of the 102nd TDF Brigade.</p>\n\n<p>Polohy sector. Nothing to write except that the entire 35th CAA (EMD) is still deployed here.</p>\n\n<p>Orikhiv sector. Since mid-February, the Russians have resumed offensive operations against Robotyne and the rest of the salient. The 70th and 71st Motorized Regiments of the 42nd Motorized Division of the 58th CAA (SMD), with support from regiments of the Territorial Forces such as the 1152nd and the 1430th, attacked Robotyne from the south and the west, respectively. Unlike what several OSINT map-makers showed, in my understanding of the events, the Ukrainians never lost control over the vast trenches system (built by the Russians and occupied by the Ukrainians in September 2023) south of Robotyne. Russian attacks by the 70th Motorized Regiment with BMP-3s had just passed these fortifications, reaching the center of the village, only to be subsequently fully neutralized by the Ukrainians. The latters have been successful in completely preventing the Russians from occupying the houses inside the village and in maintaining control over the fortifications to the south, as I was writing above, although the first forest belt to the west of the T0408 Road is likely in Russian hands. Recently the 291st Motorized Regiment of the 42nd Motorized Division (which has been in R&amp;R for months) has returned to action, with support from the 234th and 237th Air Assault Regiments of the 76th VDV Division, but no successes are reported. The 136th Motorized Brigade of the 58th CAA is deployed to the north-west of Robotyne and could carry out attacks in the near future in order to cut the T0408 Road, in the direction of Novodanylivka.</p>\n\n<p>Robotyne is defended, counterclockwise, by the 128th Mountain Assault Brigade, the 65th Mech Brigade, the &quot;Spartan&quot; Brigade of the National Guard and the 118th Mech Brigade. The 117th Mech Brigade is active between Robotyne and Verbove, to its right there is the 82nd Air Assault Brigade, the &quot;Chervona Kalyna&quot; Brigade, and approaching Novopokrovka, the &quot;Kara-Dag&quot; Brigade, in both cases of the National Guard; as well as, perhaps, the 78th Air Assault Regiment. Recently, as reinforcements, several battalions of the 141st Infantry Brigade have arrived, and the 116th Mech Brigade has returned to this sector from Avdiivka. The Russians claim that a battalion of the 101st TDF Brigade as well as some elements of the new 5th Tank Brigade and the new 154th Mech Brigade are arriving, but there is no evidence at all to confirm this.</p>\n\n<p>Where the Russians are instead achieving success is the area east of Robotyne and around Verbove, according to two geolocations released a few days ago.

After signing Beijing\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative \u2014 China\u2019s global infrastructure investment project \u2014 the country has become a hub for Chinese electric vehicle and battery production: Chinese firms like CATL, Nio, Eve Energy, Huayou Cobalt, BYD, and Ningbo Zhenyu Technology have all announced plans to build factories in Hungary. But it should be \u201cvery concerning\u201d that Hungary is trying to position itself as a \u201cbridgehead\u201d for China, one Hungarian economist told Politico. Beijing could ultimately \u201cuse any kind of economic vulnerability for blackmailing,\u201d the economist added.\n\n>...\n\n>On a trip to the U.S. this week Orb\u00e1n skipped the White House and instead visited former President Donald Trump, the likely Republican nominee in November\u2019s general election. EU watchers told The Guardian that Orb\u00e1n is likely helping Trump craft Kremlin-friendly foreign policy should he be reelected, but the meeting between the two leaders also \u201craised eyebrows\u201d about their diverging views on Beijing. \u201cIf Trump really was the China hawk he claims to be, he would be grilling Orb\u00e1n about cozying up to Beijing,\u201d a Hungarian opposition lawmaker told the paper. Hompot said that Trump and Orb\u00e1n\u2019s relationship is the result of \u201cdouble faced\u201d Hungarian politics, where Orb\u00e1n wants to maintain close ties with any authoritarian figure regardless of wider animosities.\n\nHere's an interesting piece on how China is hijacking the global far-right movement.

After signing Beijing\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative \u2014 China\u2019s global infrastructure investment project \u2014 the country has become a hub for Chinese electric vehicle and battery production: Chinese firms like CATL, Nio, Eve Energy, Huayou Cobalt, BYD, and Ningbo Zhenyu Technology have all announced plans to build factories in Hungary. But it should be \u201cvery concerning\u201d that Hungary is trying to position itself as a \u201cbridgehead\u201d for China, one Hungarian economist told Politico. Beijing could ultimately \u201cuse any kind of economic vulnerability for blackmailing,\u201d the economist added.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>On a trip to the U.S. this week Orb\u00e1n skipped the White House and instead visited former President Donald Trump, the likely Republican nominee in November\u2019s general election. EU watchers told The Guardian that Orb\u00e1n is likely helping Trump craft Kremlin-friendly foreign policy should he be reelected, but the meeting between the two leaders also \u201craised eyebrows\u201d about their diverging views on Beijing. \u201cIf Trump really was the China hawk he claims to be, he would be grilling Orb\u00e1n about cozying up to Beijing,\u201d a Hungarian opposition lawmaker told the paper. Hompot said that Trump and Orb\u00e1n\u2019s relationship is the result of \u201cdouble faced\u201d Hungarian politics, where Orb\u00e1n wants to maintain close ties with any authoritarian figure regardless of wider animosities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s an interesting piece on how China is hijacking the global far-right movement. In 2020, Trump clearly campaigned as the anti-China candidate, but now he increasingly feels like the pro-China candidate compared to Biden.</p>\n\n<p>Hungary sadly seems like a lost cause.

Cuba, Vietnam, India, various states in Africa at various times, etc. To support your friends and oppose your enemies in places like that, you need a fleet- to move cargo, to show up in port or off the coast to wave the flag and flex your muscles, to defend lines of communication, etc. Soviet Navy units inevitably showed up near Cold War hot spots just as their US counterparts did. \n\nA significant part of the Soviet Navy was also built for defense. Partially to defend the nation itself from USN CBGs and the Polaris SSBN force, both of which were critical threats to the USSR, partially to defend the USSR's own SSBN force, many units of which were kept in a well-defended \"bastion\" in the White Sea, where they would be safer from NATO attacks than they would be in the open ocean. \n\nFinally, there was always the mission of directly attacking NATO if WWIII started. This can cover the famous direct interdiction of shipping between the US and Europe, but it can also cover amphibious operations against NATO targets and even missile attacks on targets in CONUS. \n\nThe Russian navy exists to continue a shrunken version of the above. Their overseas allies are fewer, but there are still some. They are still theoretically capable of deterring USN attacks on Russia proper. And they are still (mostly the SSBNs, but maybe also the SSGNs) capable of mounting direct attacks on NATO in the event of war.

Cuba, Vietnam, India, various states in Africa at various times, etc. To support your friends and oppose your enemies in places like that, you need a fleet- to move cargo, to show up in port or off the coast to wave the flag and flex your muscles, to defend lines of communication, etc. Soviet Navy units inevitably showed up near Cold War hot spots just as their US counterparts did. </p>\n\n<p>A significant part of the Soviet Navy was also built for defense. Partially to defend the nation itself from USN CBGs and the Polaris SSBN force, both of which were critical threats to the USSR, partially to defend the USSR&#39;s own SSBN force, many units of which were kept in a well-defended &quot;bastion&quot; in the White Sea, where they would be safer from NATO attacks than they would be in the open ocean. </p>\n\n<p>Finally, there was always the mission of directly attacking NATO if WWIII started. This can cover the famous direct interdiction of shipping between the US and Europe, but it can also cover amphibious operations against NATO targets and even missile attacks on targets in CONUS. </p>\n\n<p>The Russian navy exists to continue a shrunken version of the above. Their overseas allies are fewer, but there are still some. They are still theoretically capable of deterring USN attacks on Russia proper. And they are still (mostly the SSBNs, but maybe also the SSGNs) capable of mounting direct attacks on NATO in the event of war. Their Amphib force is in pretty bad shape now, though- attacks on most plausible targets would be suicidal, especially now that the Baltic is Lake NATO.</p>\n</div>",
