Their position was more that they are not going to provide safe passage after the deal was over, but I don&#39;t think we seen any indication of active attempts to stop shipping.</p>\n\n<p>What RU have done is to strike ports, both in Odessa and on Danube, after the deal has expired. How effective that was is unclear, and seems that despite those strikes UA are able to do at least some shipping.</p>\n</div>",

So I would guess that Kurti saw an opportunity to catch a group of Serbian smugglers by surprise to show to EU and rest of the international community how Serbs are not to be trusted. And I think that the plan was just to catch them, but as usually, the plan does not survive the first contact with the enemy. So things turned awry, and Kosovo policeman died in that first stop of the Serbian smugglers. This then turned to the mini conflict between those 30 smugglers and Kosovo now gets to say and show how Serbs are the bad guys and they can move a bit of attention away from them not wanting to continue those negotiations.\n\n\nAs I say, I would not believe this to be any kind of insurgency by Serbian side, since that does not go hand in hand with Vucic plans, and the northern Kosovo is in a sort of a limbo, where couple of strongmen like Radoici\u0107 control everything, and they follow the commands from Vucic.

                "body": "An alternative hypothesis (emphasis on *hypothesis*) is that, after their CSTO flop, a similar flop from NATO would be really useful. NATO failing to offer protection it has formally committed to offering would allow the Russian government to remobilise alignment in the old CIS area based not on formal security guarantees (which it has failed to deliver on) but on geographic proximity (NATO can't protect a tiny enclave it basically surrounds and has a strong presence in -- any guarantees they offer to tiny states bordering Russia is nil). Russia doesn't need to be behind it in order to encourage it behind closed doors, and the instability that war in Europe has brought can work in favour of their allies as well, not just against them.\n\nAs long as it can maintain a sufficient degree of international plausible deniability, Serbia doesn't have anything important to lose. They are already not controlling Kosovo, it's not like they're losing territory.

                                "body": "I'm probably not because what you're presenting as a consensus in terms of a liberal theory of international relations is decidedly *not* a consensus. It's a strawman that some have-been theorists constructed in order to avoid debating more nuanced positions. If they were to argue against individual commentators, they'd end up debating the very nuances that revealed their theories to be incomplete and/or revealed their less palatable political convictions. Instead, they've come up with a simplified form of liberal theory that they can present as a consensus in that most liberal analysts won't object to it, and they're debating *that*.\n\nThat's what's led some of them (like Stephen Walt [here](https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/03/08/an-international-relations-theory-guide-to-ukraines-war/)) to claim that there was some sort of \"consensus\" that, simultaneously, thought both that war in Europe was impossible and that war in Europe was inevitable because Putin would invade Ukraine no matter what.\n\nThere are in fact a variety of views among liberal scholars on this particular topic. For example:\n\n* Krauthammer didn't live to see this invasion, but he did see the opening phase of this war (the 2014 invasion of Crimea and the Donbas).

We offered written proposals to reduce tensions.  Together with our allies and partners, we used every forum to try to prevent war, from the NATO-Russia Council to the OSCE, from the UN to our direct channels.\n\nAcross the pond, several European leaders, including von der Leyen, make a more nuanced point that traditional structuralists like Mearsheimer or Walt can't concede without undermining the core tenets of their theory -- that the interests of the Russian state and those of Putin's regime overlap to a high degree, but are distinct, and the latter either could not be fully satisfied by addressing legitimate Russian security concerns, or include additional security concerns that the Russian state has so far not articulated publicly and has refused to discuss.\n\nThat's why many European politicians talk about Putin trying to turn the clock back. European countries *have* tried to accommodate Russia's security concerns for about two decades now, not just because we'd really like a break from our thousand-year history of bloody wars, but also because economic partnership with Russia was really tight and all European countries wanted to keep it running. There's considerable frustration that, despite all that, war still broke out, over \"legitimate security concerns\" that the Russian government won't communicate and won't discuss in good faith.\n\nThe fact that imperial ambitions may be *a* factor behind it is a reasonable hypothesis, but there are several others that liberal politicians and analysts have been pointing out, such as:\n\n* The importance of maintaining a Russian-aligned Ukraine over economic and electoral interests of the Russian political establishment\n* The importance of portraying imminent NATO aggression and a besieged, surrounded Russia, in order to muffle support for leaders that could forge better ties with the West in Russian regions that already have substantial economic ties to the West through non-state-owned business organisations, to extend central control over federal subjects, and to mobilise Russian society\n\nSo at best there's a consensus that Putin's imperial ambitions is one of the factors that led to the war. I agree that it would be wrong to think this was the *only* reason, and since there's no shortage of bone-headed politicians on our side of the pond, I don't doubt there are politicians who actually hold this completely whacky view. However, given that other factors are also acknowledged, I don't think it's correct to say there's a consensus among policymakers that Putin wanted to conquer Ukraine solely for the sake of conquering Ukraine.\n\nIn addition, there's definitely no consensus among liberal European politicians that war was inevitable -- in fact, they've tried to avoid it for decades, and accommodated all sorts of Russian excesses, from attacks on military installations and extrajudicial killings of European citizens on European soil to economic and foreign relations concessions, including towards Ukraine.\n\nThere is also far from a consensus that legitimate security concerns did not play a role over the deterioration of bilateral relationships with Russia, this is literally one reason why Germany blocked NATO membership for Ukraine back in 2008.",

Regardless of specific reasoning, the liberal argument is that Russia is invading Ukraine for mostly if not purely internal reasons - how do you avoid war in this case?\n\nThat is not \"the liberal argument\", you have literally provided one quotes that has a liberal leader talking about Russia's security concerns! It's fair to argue that some, even *all* liberal leaders believe internal reasons played a role in this decision, which has been recognized as true going all the way back to... hell, not even Clausewitz, even Thucydides probably made this point.\n\nBut assuming, for the sake of the argument, that reasons were indeed entirely and purely internal, that does not exclude negotiations at all. Power struggles internal both to the Soviet Union and the Communist bloc at large played a huge role in several Cold War-era crises, from the Berlin stand-off to the Cuban missile crisis, and from the Sino-Soviet crises that never escalated past sporadic border clashes to (depending on who you believe) the Polish crisis in the early 1980s.\n\nI do think that, prior to February 2022, it would have been a perfectly legitimate move to sit down and negotiate with the current Russian establishment and work out agreements based on multilateral acknowledgement of Russian, NATO, *and Ukrainian* security concerns.\n\nOne factor that determined the current crisis is that Russia shied away from a system of formal security guarantees it had offered Ukraine, which was built over a decade of internationally-brokered negotiations in the 1990s. This left the Ukrainian leadership with no credible alternative to obtain security guarantees except for NATO membership. Russia credibly renewing these security guarantees could have made the whole point moot even as far back as 2008, or at least in 2014.\n\nBut even assuming the ship of credible security guarantees from Russia had sailed, I think it might have still been possible to reach a multilateral agreement that could have satisfied Russia's legitimate security concerns. That was especially true after the 2014 invasion, when existing territorial conflicts made NATO membership for Ukraine practically impossible without formally recognizing Russian control of Crimea and the Donbas, thus making Article 5 provisions moot as far as these territories are concerned. Mind you, I don't know what these concerns were, since Russia has never publicly articulated them in a credible way, but I see no reason why strictly defensive Russian concerns could not be reconciled with mutual NATO interests.",

What is the messaging presented to the public?\n\nWhat policymakers think and what is presented to the public by the most polarised media outlets are two very different things. IMHO, based on the evolution of European and US policy towards Russia, not only specifically about Ukraine, but on other subjects as well, starting with cca. 2005 or so, I think that US and European policymakers acknowledge the following factors as relevant causes for the last phase of escalation in Ukraine:\n\n1. A failure of NATO and Russia to work out agreements regarding mutual security guarantees -- Russia's, but NATO's as well.\n2. The failure of Russian policymakers to secure their sphere of influence through mutually beneficial economic, political and cultural ties, which has led Russia to gradually abandon the security guarantees it had offered former Soviet republics and forced them to seek other guarantees for their sovereignty and national integrity.\n3. A gradual shift in the ideology of the dominating public figures in the Russian political space, which has moved from portraying Russian participation in international institutions and comprehensive international framework from a compromise necessary for internal security and international stability (as in late Soviet/early post-Soviet era) to portraying it as a loss of national agency and weakness.\n4. The proliferation of nationalist agenda in Russian institutions, including, yes, the revival of claims to Imperial Russian possessions that Russia had long given up on, and the prominent role it played in securing internal support for Putin's regime.\n\nI'm mentioning it in what I see as the most straightforward logical order (i.e. bilateral relations, multilateral relations and context, ideological currents that underpine them), various leaders obviously ascribe different weights to each of these factors.\n\nGiven how electorally-oriented European agenda is, I wouldn't be surprised if more public-oriented politicians project their own priorities and give ample weight in their public messaging to the last factor, especially in Europe. However, if you look  at European *policy*, it's very obvious that European policymakers have not seen the war as inevitable -- in fact, they've been accomodating both legitimate and illegitimate Russian demands, for years, to the point where it frustrated large segments of the European public.\n\nI'm not trying to defend ISW's analysis -- honestly I haven't read it, and I've actually stopped reading them a while back because they moved from aggregating reliable sources (good and useful) to overly partisan analyses which... I'm sure are also useful but I can come up with those all by myself, too :-). I only think:\n\n1. The idea that the war was a) inevitable and b) only started because of Putin's imperial ambitions is not a consensus among liberal IR theorists and policymakers, just like the there's no consensus among realist theorists that it was solely, or even primarily, due to aggressive NATO expansion\n2. That arguments rooted in Russian security concerns over NATO expansion *are* perfectly legitimate, but the particular brand of realist arguments employed by analysts like Mearsheimer and Walt are incomplete both methodologically (as they fail to consider multilateral security concerns and the history of Russia's regional relations, portraying NATO expansions as a one-sided, purely ideologically-driven, NATO-initiated process) and from a strictly theoretical standpoint (as they do not account for all structural constraints that the Russian establishment is shaping Russian policy through)",

Australia and the UK will both operate the so-called SSN-Aukus. Manufacture of the boats will start towards the end of the decade, with the first SSN-Aukus boat due to be delivered in the late 2030s.\n\nAukus is seen by ministers as a key part in the government\u2019s \u201clevelling up\u201d agenda to narrow regional economic differences. Cabinet minister Michael Gove name-checked Barrow-in-Furness, the Cumbrian town where BAE Systems builds the submarines for the Royal Navy, in a speech in July, promising to make it a new \u201cpowerhouse of the North\u201d. \n\n\u201cBy backing British businesses to develop them, we\u2019re taking the long term decisions we need to boost our defence industry and to grow our economy,\u201d said Shapps. \n\nThe agreement promises decades-long work at BAE\u2019s yard at Barrow. BAE said on Sunday that the contract award would also fund significant infrastructure investment at Barrow, investment in its supply chain and the recruitment of more than 5,000 people. \n\nThe money will help to preserve submarine shipbuilding in the UK led by BAE and Rolls-Royce, which builds the reactors that power the Navy\u2019s submarines. Rolls-Royce in June announced plans to double the size of its Raynesway site in Derby as a result of the Aukus deal. \n\nBabcock International, which maintains and supports all of the UK\u2019s submarines, said on Sunday that it had signed a five-year contract with the MoD to provide input into the detailed design of SSN-Aukus. \n\nDavid Lockwood, Babcock CEO, said the \u201cimportance of applying our extensive knowledge and longstanding experience is being recognised through this contract award\u201d.",

Now let\u2019s finish the job.\u201d \nhttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/10/01/ben-wallace-ukraine-counteroffensive-succeeding/\n\nArticle: \t\n\u201cUkraine is winning. Now let\u2019s finish the job\nWhisper it if you need. Dare to think it. But champion it you must. Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive is succeeding. Slowly but surely, the Ukrainian armed forces are breaking through the Russian lines. Sometimes yard by yard, sometimes village by village, Ukraine has the momentum and is pressing forward.\n\nThe men and women of the Ukrainian army are, once again, proving to us in Nato how much we have underestimated them. First, the Establishment doubted their ability to defend their nation from the initial Russian invasion. Too many states waited to see which way the wind would blow. The groupthinkers, with their computers and \u201cRussia experience\u201d, calculated that they could only hold on for a few weeks.\n\nHaving been proved wrong, they switched their pessimism to the counteroffensive. But they failed to grasp the importance of the human factor. They failed to spot in the Ukrainians the same spirit we possessed in 1939. They failed to recall Alan Turing\u2019s quote that \u201cSometimes it is the people no one can imagine anything of who do the things no one can imagine.\u201d They failed to understand that, in war, the most precious commodity of all is hope.\nSince the summer, Ukraine has again been learning on the job. Its forces are adapting tactics, absorbing lessons, and making the best of the equipment we have all gifted them.\n\nThey take UK equipment and achieve success rates far beyond expectations. I remember visiting a secret location abroad, but outside Ukraine, as we prepared Ukrainian soldiers on how to use StarStreak air-defence missiles. They had a week to train on a system we take months to master. A British sergeant pointed to a young Ukrainian, barely out of his teens. \u201cHe won\u2019t let go of the simulator, and he won\u2019t stop training until he never misses,\u201d he said. That young man went on to down two Russian attack helicopters.\n\nWhen hope is combined with the right equipment, there is no stopping Ukraine. It is our duty to keep that hope going and to back it up with funding and equipment until the job is done. That was why the British NLAW anti-tank missiles were so important. They showed that Russian armour could be stopped. And stop them they did, in the hundreds on the road to Kyiv.\n\nWe have a chance to help finish this. The Russian army is cracking. Ukraine has learnt new tactics to overcome horrendous minefields, and the Storm Shadow strikes are devastating Russian HQs. We are witnessing the beginnings of the battle for Crimea.\n\nWe need to give Ukraine the support it requires to see this war to the end. As defence secretary, I was so often confronted with reasons not to \u2013 mainly by people who wouldn\u2019t know the difference between one end of a rifle and the other. Time was wasted having to overcome institutional inertia. We should be proud of our Chief of the Defence Staff and military leaders who demonstrated not just leadership within Whitehall, but internationally.\n\nBefore I left office, I asked the PM to match or increase the \u00a32.3 billion pledged to Ukraine this year, to add to the \u00a34.6 billion we have spent already. The UK is no longer the biggest European donor \u2013 Germany is.\n\nThis war can be won. Vladimir Putin is failing. Just as the human emotion drives Ukraine to success, it is also the inescapable flaw in Putin and his criminal regime. Romance, ego and revenge drove Putin to cross into Ukraine and it will be his undoing. His army has lost more than 2,500 tanks, 6,500 armoured vehicles and nearly 300,000 dead or injured. Not a single commander who led the major Russian units into Ukraine is still in place.\nPutin is desperately grasping at the final two things that can save him \u2013 time and the splitting of the international community. Britain can do something about both. We must help Ukraine maintain its momentum \u2013 and that will require more munitions, ATACMSs and Storm Shadows. And the best way to keep the international community together is the demonstration of success.\n\nUkraine can also play its part. The average age of the soldiers at the front is over 40. I understand President Zelensky\u2019s desire to preserve the young for the future, but the fact is that Russia is mobilising the whole country by stealth. Putin knows a pause will hand him time to build a new army. So just as Britain did in 1939 and 1941, perhaps it is time to reassess the scale of Ukraine\u2019s mobilisation.\n\nLet us not pause for one day. Let us see this through. The world is watching to see if the West has the resolve to stand up for our values and the rules-based system. What we do now for Ukraine will set the direction for all of our security for years to come.\u201d\n \nBen Wallace is a former Secretary of State for Defence",

        "body": "u/GhostofTaipei since I didn't see [your post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/16w500v/credibledefense_daily_megathread_september_30_2023/k2yrc02/) last night and I don't want to necro the thread from yesterday, here's my 2 cents (for the little that they're worth). \n\nThere's not much else for me to add that PLARealTalk didn't already mention. I think it's a mistake to view the CCP in a purely ideological lens; although they may cast themselves publicly through their MFA's Twitter account as being aggressive and happy to break with the United States, the reality is that they're [still in talks to meet with U.S. officials](https://www.reuters.com/world/us-china-talks-gather-momentum-paving-way-xi-biden-summit-wsj-2023-09-28/). Not to mention that [Blinken met with them last summer as well](https://www.npr.org/2023/06/20/1183098899/antony-blinken-beijing-china-trip-analysis). Deng Xiaoping, father of modern China, once famously stated that \"it doesn't matter whether the cat is white or black, as long as it catches mice,\" a view probably shared by people in today's Chinese administration. Actions speak louder than words, and in both previous and future tense, the U.S. and China have no desire to completely sever their linkages. Another thing to consider is that the PRC and the PLA aren't even completely aligned with each other; it's been suggested, for example, that [Xi wasn't aware of the Chinese spy balloon's trajectory](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-21/biden-says-xi-unaware-of-wayward-spy-balloon-wants-relationship) (which was launched by the army) until it floated over CONUS. \n\nIs the nationalist game that both sides are playing dangerous for stoking tensions and pushing us further towards open confrontation? Absolutely, but war is nowhere near inevitable or even likely. There's just as much room to repair the relationship, and I think the Biden administration is beginning to recognize that although the U.S. can delink with China to a degree, the current global economic system makes it impossible for the two largest economies in the world to ever completely disentangle from each other. I'm hesitant to play forecaster and predict what the future holds. But as an Asian-American who grew up in a Taiwanese- and Chinese-American community, I hope that both sides will choose deescalation. We don't have to agree on everything, but there are too many global problems (like global warming, demographics cliff, and the rise of transnational terror and crime organizations) that we can't afford to delay fixing.\n\nFinally, I just wanted to say that I'm honored that some posters put me in the same bucket of credibility as FallacyDestroyer, PLARealTalk, and others in the OP. I'm not a big brain defense analyst or a China watcher who's studied the language since he was five, just some dude who listens to much smarter and better informed people to synthesize an opinion. I know that this is Reddit and ultimately all of our credibility is basically none, but it's still gratifying to be seen as someone semi-credible within Reddit.",

Not to mention that <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/06/20/1183098899/antony-blinken-beijing-china-trip-analysis\">Blinken met with them last summer as well</a>. Deng Xiaoping, father of modern China, once famously stated that &quot;it doesn&#39;t matter whether the cat is white or black, as long as it catches mice,&quot; a view probably shared by people in today&#39;s Chinese administration. Actions speak louder than words, and in both previous and future tense, the U.S. and China have no desire to completely sever their linkages. Another thing to consider is that the PRC and the PLA aren&#39;t even completely aligned with each other; it&#39;s been suggested, for example, that <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-21/biden-says-xi-unaware-of-wayward-spy-balloon-wants-relationship\">Xi wasn&#39;t aware of the Chinese spy balloon&#39;s trajectory</a> (which was launched by the army) until it floated over CONUS. </p>\n\n<p>Is the nationalist game that both sides are playing dangerous for stoking tensions and pushing us further towards open confrontation? Absolutely, but war is nowhere near inevitable or even likely. There&#39;s just as much room to repair the relationship, and I think the Biden administration is beginning to recognize that although the U.S. can delink with China to a degree, the current global economic system makes it impossible for the two largest economies in the world to ever completely disentangle from each other. I&#39;m hesitant to play forecaster and predict what the future holds. But as an Asian-American who grew up in a Taiwanese- and Chinese-American community, I hope that both sides will choose deescalation. We don&#39;t have to agree on everything, but there are too many global problems (like global warming, demographics cliff, and the rise of transnational terror and crime organizations) that we can&#39;t afford to delay fixing.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, I just wanted to say that I&#39;m honored that some posters put me in the same bucket of credibility as FallacyDestroyer, PLARealTalk, and others in the OP. I&#39;m not a big brain defense analyst or a China watcher who&#39;s studied the language since he was five, just some dude who listens to much smarter and better informed people to synthesize an opinion. I know that this is Reddit and ultimately all of our credibility is basically none, but it&#39;s still gratifying to be seen as someone semi-credible within Reddit.</p>\n</div>",

If they tried to displace large distances they&#39;d be moving and easy to spot when the Lancets showed up. </p>\n\n<p>That said, both sides were done this earlier in the war too before Lancets showed up. I think it&#39;s because they would have too much trouble coordinating constant displacement so they assume the risk. As long as they aren&#39;t directly where they fired, it&#39;s good enough. Remember that both sides weren&#39;t excellently trained before the war, and they certainly weren&#39;t after it started. They mostly learn by doing, and will continue bad habits if they don&#39;t suffer obvious negative repercussions.</p>\n</div>",

However, per my assessment, Ukraine's Beavers appear to be inferior to the Shaheds in terms of payload capacity, reliability, and accuracy. I'm puzzled as to why Ukraine hasn't attempted to 100% reverse engineer and copy the Shahed drones, especially since they possess numerous (almost intact) samples from crashes.\n\nUkraine's industrial capacity is notably weaker than Russia's (both pre-war and during this war). All of Ukraine's production facilities are within Russia's strike range, making it challenging to bootstrap new manufacturing projects.\n\nIf one bets that Ukraine's production capabilities of anything (whether for tanks, shells, howitzers, or drones) will surpass Russia's, they're likely mistaken. If it were Poland's factories producing the Beavers, I'd concur that both sides can play that game.
