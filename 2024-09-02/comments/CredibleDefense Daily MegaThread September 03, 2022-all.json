They killed the women and removed their stomach and intestines.\u201d\n\n>The incident, according to Ali and another witness, occurred on Dec. 6 last year. They said at least six other women in B\u00e8z\u00e8r\u00e8 were killed in the same manner across the village.\n\n>\u201cAs I was leaving the village, I saw the body of a woman who was pregnant,\u201d Malik Tete, a 29-year-old bricklayer who fled B\u00e8z\u00e8r\u00e8 to Cameroon after the incident, told The Daily Beast. **\u201cThey had cut her open, removed her baby and her intestines and left them on top of her dead body.\u201d**\n\n>Following the violence in B\u00e8z\u00e8r\u00e8, thousands of people, according to Ali and Tete, fled the village to Bocaranga, about 27 kilometers southeast of B\u00e8z\u00e8r\u00e8. Many others, including the witnesses, sought refuge in settlements for refugees in the eastern part of Cameroon.\n\n>\u201cWe were scared that these white soldiers would return and kill all of us, so we had to leave the village,\u201d said Ali, who fled to Ngaoundere town in the central Adamawa region of Cameroon. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t run away, we probably would have been dead by now.\u201d\n\n>It wasn\u2019t only in B\u00e8z\u00e8r\u00e8 that women were said to have been slaughtered by the Russians last December. In the nearby L\u00e9t\u00e9l\u00e9 community, locals told The Daily Beast that they found the disemboweled bodies of four women lying dead in different locations on the day Russian mercenaries stormed the village in search of rebels from the Return, Reclamation, Rehabilitation (3R) group.\n\n>\u201cI saw with my eyes when a white soldier stabbed a woman with a knife on her belly,\u201d Bissafi, a 30-year-old farmer now living in CAR's capital city of Bangui, told The Daily Beast. \u201cThey said she was being punished for marrying a man working for a rebel group.\u201d\n\n>Given the manner in which the victims were allegedly killed, the Russians \u201cclearly wanted to torture the women to death,\u201d said Sylvestre, who\u2014like other witnesses residing in CAR\u2014The Daily Beast is choosing to identify by his first name to protect him from possible retribution.\n\n>Those who recognized some of the alleged victims in both B\u00e8z\u00e8r\u00e8 and L\u00e9t\u00e9l\u00e9 said they were women residing in areas in the two villages where rebels of the 3R faction, one of CAR\u2019s most powerful armed groups\u2014which presents itself as a self-defense militia\u2014have been active.\n\n\n>\u201cThey [Russian mercenaries] believe all the men in the areas where 3R rebels are present are part of the rebel group,\u201d Souleyman, a local vigilante in L\u00e9t\u00e9l\u00e9, told The Daily Beast. \u201cEach time they meet people from these areas, they accuse them of supporting the rebels and even physically attack them.\u201d\n\n>Some of the victims, according to Souleyman, who has been in touch with their families as well as persons who witnessed the killings, are wives of young men accused of being \u201ctoo friendly\u201d with 3R militants.\n\n>Made up of mostly Muslim cattle herders, the 3R group was originally formed in 2015 to protect the minority Puehl population in northwestern CAR, where conflicts with farmers are common. In December 2020, the group joined the Coalition of Patriots for Change (CPC), an alliance of CAR\u2019s armed groups that began an offensive just before the country\u2019s presidential election to stop the re-election of President Faustin Archange Touad\u00e9ra and overthrow his government. The rebels constantly target CAR forces and allied Russian paramilitaries who, in response, have been conducting a counter-offensive against the militants. But, as a number of locals have alleged, the Russians may now be taking war to civilians who live in the exact communities where these rebels operate.\n\n>\u201cIt is sad that they [Russian mercenaries] are now targeting our women,\u201d Djibril, a B\u00e8z\u00e8r\u00e8-born artisanal miner based in the southwestern city of Berb\u00e9rati, told The Daily Beast. \u201cI know two people whose wives were brutally killed in December by these [Russian] soldiers.\u201d\n\n>Neither the CAR government nor Yevgeny Prigozhin, a close friend of President Vladimir Putin who reportedly runs the Wagner Group, responded to The Daily Beast\u2019s request for comments on the alleged disemboweling of women in B\u00e8z\u00e8r\u00e8 and L\u00e9t\u00e9l\u00e9. Emails sent to the spokesperson of CAR\u2019s Ministry of Communication and Media and to Concord Management, a company majority-owned by Prigozhin, went unanswered.\n\n>A local official in Ouham Prefecture, which covers B\u00e8z\u00e8r\u00e8 and L\u00e9t\u00e9l\u00e9, told The Daily Beast the prefecture\u2019s government was aware of the alleged incidents in the two areas and had informed authorities in Bangui about them.\n\n>\u201cNo one [in Bangui] has even condemned what was done to the women in the communities involved,\u201d said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity as he wasn\u2019t authorized to speak on the subject. \u201cThis is so unfortunate.\u201d\n\n>There have been reports of Russian-linked forces targeting women in CAR before now. In May, The Daily Beast reported how Wagner mercenaries allegedly stormed a hospital in the capital Bangui the previous month and attacked mothers recovering from childbirth, as well as medical personnel looking after them, on multiple occasions. **One of the victims, according to a local independent news outlet which spoke to an eyewitness, was allegedly sexually assaulted for hours by the mercenaries.**\n\n>Sources who spoke to The Daily Beast about the alleged incidents said they were appalled that the victims may not even be related to those whose crimes they were being punished for.\n\n>\u201cWatching helpless women beg for their lives and seeing them slaughtered like animals is the worst thing a man can do to a fellow human being,\u201d said Ali. \u201cI have no words to describe what these [Russian] soldiers have done.\u201d",

If Ukraine took out 1 Russian tank a day, that would be 365 tanks a year. But they can replace 150-300 of them each year (allegedly, depending on whose numbers you believe). So net, each year, say Russia can make 200 tanks a year they would be down maybe -165 tanks. That means after replacement they would still have 835 tanks. *That is a shit load of tanks in operation*.\n\nHere, Ukraine took out at least 1,000. They can replace, say, 200, so they are net -800 loss in 180 days (call it net -900 if they can make 100 tanks in 180 days). If Russia can build 200 tanks a year, it will take them *4 years* to replace those tanks if the war ended today. That's wild. That's absolutely wild. These numbers are staggering, but we have just grown accustomed to this figure of 1,000 lost tanks, it has become too abstract I think. \n\nSo, it's not just that they are gone, its the pace they were taken out with as well.  1,000 destroyed tanks in 180 days is a big, big deal, and it matters very, very much that Russia doesn't have those tanks.

If Ukraine took out 1 Russian tank a day, that would be 365 tanks a year. But they can replace 150-300 of them each year (allegedly, depending on whose numbers you believe). So net, each year, say Russia can make 200 tanks a year they would be down maybe -165 tanks. That means after replacement they would still have 835 tanks. <em>That is a shit load of tanks in operation</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Here, Ukraine took out at least 1,000. They can replace, say, 200, so they are net -800 loss in 180 days (call it net -900 if they can make 100 tanks in 180 days). If Russia can build 200 tanks a year, it will take them <em>4 years</em> to replace those tanks if the war ended today. That&#39;s wild. That&#39;s absolutely wild. These numbers are staggering, but we have just grown accustomed to this figure of 1,000 lost tanks, it has become too abstract I think. </p>\n\n<p>So, it&#39;s not just that they are gone, its the pace they were taken out with as well.  1,000 destroyed tanks in 180 days is a big, big deal, and it matters very, very much that Russia doesn&#39;t have those tanks. Especially to Ukrainians.</p>\n</div>",

Estimate includes 220-270 Artillery Tubes and 72-96 MLRS systems.\n\nIf we assume just 1 launch per day from the MLRS systems on average (and we know approx 1 truck load is approx 3 grad reloads) thats about 25-30 trucks a day just for MLRS rockets.\n\nIf we assume an average of 50 rounds per day per tube, thats 12,500 rounds per day. At 52kg per shell (ignoring propellant, fuses and packing weight) thats 650t per day in artillery ammo required Probably up at 700t per day once other supplies are included.... so thats another 100-120 trucks per day just there in artillery ammo.\n\nOn top of that, there is all the rest of their ammo, fuel, food, parts, misc supplies needs which may be as many trucks required again or more.\n\nI don't think they can feed that with a couple of jury rigged ferries moving 10-15 trucks at a time and dealing with occasional MLRS/Arty strikes.... and even the figures above would seem to me to be starving at least some of the artillery at least some of the time.",

Estimate includes 220-270 Artillery Tubes and 72-96 MLRS systems.</p>\n\n<p>If we assume just 1 launch per day from the MLRS systems on average (and we know approx 1 truck load is approx 3 grad reloads) thats about 25-30 trucks a day just for MLRS rockets.</p>\n\n<p>If we assume an average of 50 rounds per day per tube, thats 12,500 rounds per day. At 52kg per shell (ignoring propellant, fuses and packing weight) thats 650t per day in artillery ammo required Probably up at 700t per day once other supplies are included.... so thats another 100-120 trucks per day just there in artillery ammo.</p>\n\n<p>On top of that, there is all the rest of their ammo, fuel, food, parts, misc supplies needs which may be as many trucks required again or more.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t think they can feed that with a couple of jury rigged ferries moving 10-15 trucks at a time and dealing with occasional MLRS/Arty strikes.... and even the figures above would seem to me to be starving at least some of the artillery at least some of the time.</p>\n</div>",

Would the Rebels have taken the bait if they thought the Death Star was fully operational and a massive imperial fleet was in orbit nearby?

You go out of your way to create the greatest kill zone possible. Do you then block the road so it's nearly impossible for a truck to enter the kill zone? Nope, you go out of your way to make the road seem safe and enticing.\n\nAlso, most of the official fanfare from the govt about the offensive was not about the Kherson city bridgehead on the west side of the Dnieper, it referenced the entire \"South\" in particular and from Zelensky himself specifically added the criteria of liberating the Black Sea coast, which means all of Kherson oblast ([source](https://web.archive.org/web/20220710203044/https://www.latestly.com/socially/world/reznikov-zelensky-had-ordered-ukraines-army-to-liberate-ukraines-coast-latest-tweet-by-the-kyiv-independent-3933176.html)). As it is, a significant amount of Russian reinforcements didn't cross the river and are still in Kherson oblast east of the river as reserves because nobody has a clue so far how big this offensive will actually be. And as the Russian units aren't on the western side of the river they don't need to worry about their supplies being cut due to bridges. They're not trapped, they're not in a kill zone, wrong area.\n\nOccam's Razor time:\n\n- The UAF worked on disabling the bridges and denying the Russians the ability to cross the Dnieper to PREVENT them from reinforcing and resupplying the western side. \n\n- Ukrainian politicians [telegraphed the counteroffensive](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-62118953) right after Luhansk oblast was lost following the [fall of Lysychansk](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-62030051), to follow up a bad news cycle with good news, to raise morale. \n\n- Talking up the counteroffensive and disabling the bridges worked in conjunction for their strategic plan that was to avoid a major campaign to retake the Kherson bridgehead by assault, so the aim of their IO campaign was to try to make it grossly apparent to the Russians that they would only be destroyed west of the river. \n\nI said it months ago, it's worth saying again. The only logical military reason for the Russians to fight hard to hold the Kherson bridgehead when the bridges were already targeted so early on is because of the assumption that they can force an end to this war but winter if they can impair/seriously attrit/outright halt the first large scale advertised UA counteroffensive. If the UAF comes out of this campaign with little progress, lots of casualties, and their supplies exhausted then possibly western NATO patrons might decide the military solution is out for ending the war. If so, it's worth gambling. \n\nIf that's the case, that's why the Russians reinforced the bridgehead despite the bridges being hit and their logistics so precarious. And that's why the UAF offensives didn't succeed stupendously, they ran into lots more Russian units (especially VDV) who showed up in mid August. And that's why the UAF are now shifting the IO narrative that success isn't a matter of villages liberated but about Russian manpower and material lost. If the UA IO campaign can convince the Russians that the Ukrainians don't really care about retaking ground, then a Russian plan to delay the UAF retaking ground doesn't work. Which means the Russians don't have a good military reason to be fighting on the west side of the river, which goes back to the hopes of the UAF that they can win this campaign without assault or even a lengthy battle of attrition.",

They&#39;re not trapped, they&#39;re not in a kill zone, wrong area.</p>\n\n<p>Occam&#39;s Razor time:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The UAF worked on disabling the bridges and denying the Russians the ability to cross the Dnieper to PREVENT them from reinforcing and resupplying the western side. </p></li>\n<li><p>Ukrainian politicians <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-62118953\">telegraphed the counteroffensive</a> right after Luhansk oblast was lost following the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-62030051\">fall of Lysychansk</a>, to follow up a bad news cycle with good news, to raise morale. </p></li>\n<li><p>Talking up the counteroffensive and disabling the bridges worked in conjunction for their strategic plan that was to avoid a major campaign to retake the Kherson bridgehead by assault, so the aim of their IO campaign was to try to make it grossly apparent to the Russians that they would only be destroyed west of the river. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I said it months ago, it&#39;s worth saying again. The only logical military reason for the Russians to fight hard to hold the Kherson bridgehead when the bridges were already targeted so early on is because of the assumption that they can force an end to this war but winter if they can impair/seriously attrit/outright halt the first large scale advertised UA counteroffensive. If the UAF comes out of this campaign with little progress, lots of casualties, and their supplies exhausted then possibly western NATO patrons might decide the military solution is out for ending the war. If so, it&#39;s worth gambling. </p>\n\n<p>If that&#39;s the case, that&#39;s why the Russians reinforced the bridgehead despite the bridges being hit and their logistics so precarious. And that&#39;s why the UAF offensives didn&#39;t succeed stupendously, they ran into lots more Russian units (especially VDV) who showed up in mid August. And that&#39;s why the UAF are now shifting the IO narrative that success isn&#39;t a matter of villages liberated but about Russian manpower and material lost. If the UA IO campaign can convince the Russians that the Ukrainians don&#39;t really care about retaking ground, then a Russian plan to delay the UAF retaking ground doesn&#39;t work. Which means the Russians don&#39;t have a good military reason to be fighting on the west side of the river, which goes back to the hopes of the UAF that they can win this campaign without assault or even a lengthy battle of attrition.</p>\n</div>",

I'm just not convinced that the decision to fight was reached on purely military grounds because if this gamble does not work Russia faces a potential military desaster.

They sincerely, like children, hope that the supplies to Ukraine indicated in the Pentagon's lists are exhaustive lists, and strictly from this logic they build the tactics of their actions.\n\n Then, as in the case of the AGM-88, they make a surprised look when they lose a large amount of equipment in a short period of time.\n\n In addition to the surprised look, their faces contain the same series of childish naive questions from the category: \"How is it, it's not fair ?!\"  War, in principle, is a thing where there is little that is honest.\n In this regard, a big request - explain to all our field commanders that it is necessary to build your actions in such a way as to be as confident as possible as a result of your work, reducing to zero the risks from the unexpected appearance of new variables in the assortment of Western weapons or the use by the enemy of any  tricks.\n\n\n And the second aspect - you need to quickly learn from your mistakes.  For example, how many more times do we need to smash our warehouses in order to force the generals to make decisions about their dispersal?  They will probably answer that it will be logistically inconvenient, it will take longer, etc. - The delivery of ammunition from their storage sites in Russia takes longer.\n\n And yes, each MLRS system has its own firing sector, the maximum range of missiles.  Please disperse ammunition storage areas with these variables in mind.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Interesting &quot;letter from the front&quot; published by Russian Telegram channels</p>\n\n<p>romanov_92/26425</p>\n\n<p>(you know what to add)</p>\n\n<h1>evil_letters_from_the_front</h1>\n\n<p>Front-line soldiers write to two majors:</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI would like to turn to the military-political leadership of Russia, which is able to effectively influence the following.</p>\n\n<p>Analyzing combat experience, I noted for myself one completely Russian feature of our field generals.  They sincerely, like children, hope that the supplies to Ukraine indicated in the Pentagon&#39;s lists are exhaustive lists, and strictly from this logic they build the tactics of their actions.</p>\n\n<p>Then, as in the case of the AGM-88, they make a surprised look when they lose a large amount of equipment in a short period of time.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the surprised look, their faces contain the same series of childish naive questions from the category: &quot;How is it, it&#39;s not fair ?!&quot;  War, in principle, is a thing where there is little that is honest.\n In this regard, a big request - explain to all our field commanders that it is necessary to build your actions in such a way as to be as confident as possible as a result of your work, reducing to zero the risks from the unexpected appearance of new variables in the assortment of Western weapons or the use by the enemy of any  tricks.</p>\n\n<p>And the second aspect - you need to quickly learn from your mistakes.  For example, how many more times do we need to smash our warehouses in order to force the generals to make decisions about their dispersal?  They will probably answer that it will be logistically inconvenient, it will take longer, etc. - The delivery of ammunition from their storage sites in Russia takes longer.</p>\n\n<p>And yes, each MLRS system has its own firing sector, the maximum range of missiles.  Please disperse ammunition storage areas with these variables in mind.  This will exclude getting into all the warehouses at the same time, it seems that even the schoolboy understands this.</p>\n\n<p>About the situation with pontoon crossings in the Kherson region, I hope you will think of it yourself.</p>\n\n<p>If any of our actions does not give a guaranteed result, then it is necessary to change the approach, or personnel, and not hysterically smash your forehead against the same rake from time to time.</p>\n\n<p>I sincerely hope for the prudence of superiors.

Those felons and conscripts in the rear would be getting merc'd nearly incessantly by strikes, and it is not clear that Ukrainian special ops working behind enemy lines would be any less efficient at killing Russians and their collaborators. HARMS still exist. Russia just sent another [Buk to Melitopol](https://twitter.com/GeoConfirmed/status/1566001476052389893). \n\nI'm guessing it is going to hang around Kherson oblast. There is now a sneaking suspicion that Russia has lost some air denial capability with these TB-2 videos coming out (I personally believe that Buk is a direct response). HIMARS and HARMS have wrecked the balance. What can mobilization do for that? My guess is just put more Russians in harm's way to get them killed.\n\nIs that the end of the story? No, aside from all the other things I missed, in at most a year and half there will western fighters, whether Grippen or F-16, firing full fledged NATO caliber missiles (including those with stand off strike capability) and dropping JDAMs on those Russian positions. Ukraine is going to have an honest to goodness SEAD capability. \n\nWhat are all those Russian conscripts going to do, waive?",

Those felons and conscripts in the rear would be getting merc&#39;d nearly incessantly by strikes, and it is not clear that Ukrainian special ops working behind enemy lines would be any less efficient at killing Russians and their collaborators. HARMS still exist. Russia just sent another <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeoConfirmed/status/1566001476052389893\">Buk to Melitopol</a>. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m guessing it is going to hang around Kherson oblast. There is now a sneaking suspicion that Russia has lost some air denial capability with these TB-2 videos coming out (I personally believe that Buk is a direct response). HIMARS and HARMS have wrecked the balance. What can mobilization do for that? My guess is just put more Russians in harm&#39;s way to get them killed.</p>\n\n<p>Is that the end of the story? No, aside from all the other things I missed, in at most a year and half there will western fighters, whether Grippen or F-16, firing full fledged NATO caliber missiles (including those with stand off strike capability) and dropping JDAMs on those Russian positions. Ukraine is going to have an honest to goodness SEAD capability. </p>\n\n<p>What are all those Russian conscripts going to do, waive?</p>\n</div>",

And just as they thought the escalation on Feb 24th would be successful, they\u2019re failure to think strategically, tactically, or reverse the map with mobilization creates enormous risk.\n\nMobilization itself, and threatening the United States or creating war like acts against the U.S. or in some waterway - leaves room for escalation on the American side.\n\nSecondary sanctions to start. Secondary sanctions are the proper response to mobilization. At the point Russia mobilizes, the west knows that it will need to completely starve Russia\u2019s war machine. Russia is now empirically much more dangerous, the prior sanctions didn\u2019t work, Russia has fully mobilized and the West hasn\u2019t. There is an imbalance.\n\nJust as Putin failed to predict the sting of the current sanctions that would result, critics in the west will point out the sanctions on Russia currently are too weak, ineffective, and haven\u2019t deterred him. \n\nBalance must be maintained, they will want to drain his positive account balance much more quickly. The point is no longer deterrence but to minimize the threat to the West from his gun and armor production, his increased military industrial capacity.\n\nThe sanctions won\u2019t be meant to deter but meant to cripple the mobilization itself.\n\nFor war like threats and acts, like detonating a tactical nuke in the air or increasing nuclear proliferation (choosing to become an outright international pariah state with no western partnerships at all), mining waterways (interfering with American and international commerce or business) the United States and its coalition of partners will respond. That would provide a classic justification for America to (among other things) begin to loosen the restrictions on materiale and weaponry being sent to Ukraine. \n\nThink of when Putin attempted to murder the Skripals. That was two people, and Putin lost much of his intelligence apparatus across the world. Escalating in Europe or elsewhere will bring to bear events targeting Russia that Russia seems - as a nation - to have an incomprehensibly large blind spot to.\n\nAt that point, Russia losing in Ukraine becomes a national security issue for the United States. Just like Russians failed to predict the influx of weaponry like HIMARS, HARM, and 800,000 American 155mm NATO rounds and 8000 javelins flooding into Ukraine in 180 days, they think mere threats or pariah acts that make Russia look even worse on the world stage will prevent the United States from drastically escalation the lethality of weaponry provided Ukraine rather than *increase* it. \n\nStrategic weapons now enter the game, with mobilization certainly ATACMS will be a response, Ukraine will need to be able to shape the battlefield by killing Russians anytime, anywhere, and take out S-400 and S-300 systems in preparation for the introduction of Ukrainian F-16s or Grippens and their laser guided bombs, both 500lb and 2,000lb, bunker busting or not, stand-off strike missiles, all that capability on Russian strategic systems - especially S-400/300 etc.\n\nThere will be a lot more Russian foreheads in Ukraine after mobilization, and about the time that mobilization has an impact on the war 1-2 years out, F-16/Grippen training will be complete, and Russia might discover that they lack the full capability to protect them from the new levels of weaponry that are flooding in.\n\nI mean, Russia can\u2019t protect its troops right now, either. But it also won\u2019t be able to do so in the future, with mobilization, as well.",

The point is no longer deterrence but to minimize the threat to the West from his gun and armor production, his increased military industrial capacity.</p>\n\n<p>The sanctions won\u2019t be meant to deter but meant to cripple the mobilization itself.</p>\n\n<p>For war like threats and acts, like detonating a tactical nuke in the air or increasing nuclear proliferation (choosing to become an outright international pariah state with no western partnerships at all), mining waterways (interfering with American and international commerce or business) the United States and its coalition of partners will respond. That would provide a classic justification for America to (among other things) begin to loosen the restrictions on materiale and weaponry being sent to Ukraine. </p>\n\n<p>Think of when Putin attempted to murder the Skripals. That was two people, and Putin lost much of his intelligence apparatus across the world. Escalating in Europe or elsewhere will bring to bear events targeting Russia that Russia seems - as a nation - to have an incomprehensibly large blind spot to.</p>\n\n<p>At that point, Russia losing in Ukraine becomes a national security issue for the United States. Just like Russians failed to predict the influx of weaponry like HIMARS, HARM, and 800,000 American 155mm NATO rounds and 8000 javelins flooding into Ukraine in 180 days, they think mere threats or pariah acts that make Russia look even worse on the world stage will prevent the United States from drastically escalation the lethality of weaponry provided Ukraine rather than <em>increase</em> it. </p>\n\n<p>Strategic weapons now enter the game, with mobilization certainly ATACMS will be a response, Ukraine will need to be able to shape the battlefield by killing Russians anytime, anywhere, and take out S-400 and S-300 systems in preparation for the introduction of Ukrainian F-16s or Grippens and their laser guided bombs, both 500lb and 2,000lb, bunker busting or not, stand-off strike missiles, all that capability on Russian strategic systems - especially S-400/300 etc.</p>\n\n<p>There will be a lot more Russian foreheads in Ukraine after mobilization, and about the time that mobilization has an impact on the war 1-2 years out, F-16/Grippen training will be complete, and Russia might discover that they lack the full capability to protect them from the new levels of weaponry that are flooding in.</p>\n\n<p>I mean, Russia can\u2019t protect its troops right now, either. But it also won\u2019t be able to do so in the future, with mobilization, as well.</p>\n</div>",
