Medical staff worked around the clock treating the wounded in a bunker, as fighters outside mounted fierce resistance against appalling odds.\n\n> Yevgen Gerasimenko, a retired military surgeon, was working in a hospital in Dnipro, southeastern Ukraine, when Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February last year. Like so many others, he put his hand up to defend his homeland.\n\n>What followed was a daring flight into besieged Mariupol on a helicopter loaded with ammunition. The plan was to smuggle him into Azovstal to save lives.\n\n>After the steelworks and city fell to Kremlin forces on 20 May, he spent four months as a prisoner of war.\n\n>\"I can't think about Azovstal without tears in my eyes\", Yevgen, 62, tells Sky News in an exclusive interview for the anniversary of the surrender of the steelworks.\n\n>> Flying low into Mariupol under cover of darkness\n\n>\"Helicopters were there waiting for us,\" he said.\n\n>It was 2am on 31 March 2022 and Yevgen was at an airport with a group of fellow medics including another surgeon, two anaesthesiologists and a head nurse.\n\n> There wasn't even enough room to sit down in the aircraft because of all the supplies packed tightly onboard.\n\n>\"We flew really low, about eight or 10 metres above the land. Sometimes I even felt we touched the tops of trees.\"\n\n>They landed successfully and transferred to motorboats which were loaded with ammunition and weapons.\n\n> \"We couldn't have any lights, it was dangerous. We didn't want anyone to spot us so we had to use GPS to get to Azovstal.\"\n\n>It took about an hour to reach the docks near the factory. But their adventure was far from over - airstrikes started as the group approached the plant and lasted for about three hours.\n\n>They watched as planes approached the metalworks and dropped bombs just 700 metres or so from where they were hidden. Eventually, they made it inside.\n\n>> Inside the factory fortress\n\n>\"We were exposed to constant bombardment from the enemy,\" Yevgen said. \"They tried to hit us from air, land and sea.\"\n\n>There was a constant flow of wounded coming into the bunker where Yevgen and his colleagues worked, treating about 350 patients at a time.\n\n> \"Our medical staff were physically exhausted and psychologically depressed. They had to work 24/7 with injured people.\n\n>\"There wasn't enough air in there. There wasn't enough drinking water, food or sunshine.\"\n\n>> Azovstal fighters lay down their arms\n\n>The defence of Mariupol has already gone down in history, with the last Ukrainian soldiers holding out for weeks in the ruins of their city.\n\n>Finally President Volodymyr Zelenskyy gave the order for all those who remained in the steelworks to surrender.\n\n>In Yevgen's view, \"that order saved the lives of over 2,500 people\".\n\n> On 20 May, after more than 80 days of resistance, the last Ukrainian fighters laid down their arms. Those who had defended the steelworks were hailed as heroes by their government.\n\n>They were credited with tying up Russian troops for weeks, buying time for Ukrainian forces elsewhere to regroup and rearm.\n\n>> Four months as a prisoner of war\n\n>After their surrender, any hopes that he and his colleagues would be immediately returned to Ukraine, or granted rights consistent with their status as medical professionals under the rules of war were dashed.\n\n>\"Russia did not follow the Geneva Convention. It violated all the rules,\" he said.\n\n>\"All our medical staff, including nurses and military doctors, were taken hostage.\"\n\n> Yevgen says he was held captive for a total of four months. He was taken prisoner on 20 May - he remembers the date because it's his wife's birthday - until 20 September when he was released back into Ukrainian-held territory.\n\n>\"It's difficult to describe the feelings I experienced during that time\", he said.\n\n>\"I feel bitterness, and I feel sorry for the nurses and medical staff who are still in Russian-held territory, illegally kept as prisoners of war.\"\n\n>>Heart of Azovstal project\n\n>Yevgen was able to return home. He is now back working at a hospital treating wounded soldiers.\n\n>He is also promoting the Heart of Azovstal project, an initiative launched by Ukrainian billionaire Rinat Akhmetov to support people who helped defend Mariupol, and the families of those still in captivity.\n\n>The project includes treatment and rehabilitation programmes designed to meet the diverse needs of the soldiers and their families, and help them return to a civilian lifestyle.\n\n> Looking back at the events of 12 months ago, Yevgen says it is tough to think about what happened. But, he adds, if he could go back to March 2022 he would do it all over again.\n\n>\"Mariupol, Donetsk and Luhansk regions and Crimea - this is our homeland and we must defend it.\"\n\nThink most of us know about the helicopter pilots and the daring flights to Azovstal, but I wasn\u2019t aware of this part of the story.",

Just like with current missile AA systems, future anti-drone systems will likely have many microwave emitters and just one or a few radar units. It's best to keep them separate so that a single strike doesn't cripple the system. At least that's how it will likely be for static ground systems and ship systems, there will probably be mobile systems where everything is packaged into a single vehicle for infantry and armored support roles.\n\nPhased array emitters can make multiple independent beams in different directions. The more antennas you add, the more beams you can have and the narrower the beams become. They also don't have to fire all that long to fry a drone, so even if anti-microwave radiation missiles are used they would have to be timed to arrive perfectly alongside the drone swarm. That means you have to already know where all of the AA systems are, or you can't time your launches properly.\n\nSo really it's technically doable, it just seems way easier to use anti-radar missiles because there's a lot less that can go wrong, and the radar is usually the most expensive piece of the system.",

They also don&#39;t have to fire all that long to fry a drone, so even if anti-microwave radiation missiles are used they would have to be timed to arrive perfectly alongside the drone swarm. That means you have to already know where all of the AA systems are, or you can&#39;t time your launches properly.</p>\n\n<p>So really it&#39;s technically doable, it just seems way easier to use anti-radar missiles because there&#39;s a lot less that can go wrong, and the radar is usually the most expensive piece of the system.</p>\n</div>",

            "body": "I think this question really requires an interrogation of what development actually means in the context of Vladimir Putin. I think all the evidence bears out that he considers development in a very different light than we might consider it in the west.\n\nYou can talk about the development of the nation as the economic prosperity of individuals, which I think is the western conception of development. But you can also talk about development in terms of the state's ability to project political power, which is maybe more of a Chinese take on what development means. But then you have another level, which is the overall strength of a nation, separate from any state or state that represents it, which is I think Vladimir Putin's final take on the issue. The further he's pursued the ideology of a Russian world, the more and more I'm starting to think his project is the overall ability for ethnic Russians to project political power on the global stage.\n\nThis project has had a few core tenants that we can identify. I think Vladimir Putin clearly wants to unify Russian speakers under the russian state, and sees Russian speakers living outside of the Russian state as being oppressed and under the control of nefarious foreign governments. Putin has also pretty clearly pursued the reintegration of Russian adjacent ethnicities like Belarusians and Ukrainians into the Russian state as well, and I'm certain he takes the position that the existence of those countries is an artifact of external influences imposed on Russia at the end of the First World War. Beyond that, there is a tier of non-Russian ethnicities who rightfully belong under Moscow's thumb, partially the Siberian ethnicities contained within the federation, but also central Asia and Eastern Europe, including the Baltic states, Finland, Poland, and the Balkans. And I think the eventual goal of all of this is that Putin believes putting all of these puzzle pieces together will make the Russian federation a leading global superpower that can compete with the United States and the European Union, and possibly exceed them because the Russian state will be organized under a strongman who can take dedicated action on behalf of the Russian nation, and not be politically paralyzed by the forces of liberal democracy.\n\nI also don't think a lot of people have really dug in very much to the ideological underpinnings of this. I very much think, the more I've read translations of Putin at least, that he really does conflate the forces of European colonialism, the Nazi regime during the Second World War, the Soviet Union which he both admires and despises, and the modern institution of NATO and liberal Western democracy in general. \n\nIn that sense, I think he's a lot like Osama Bin Laden, who Western governments and media described for decades as somebody motivated purely by fanatical hatred for western freedom, and not to say he was a great guy or anything, but when you actually listened to what he complained about, he talked more about things like Sykes-Picot and the establishment of mandatory Palestine than anything else. Putin's worldview and his actions are driven by a very specific and tailored view of history that is not covered at all in English language media, and is totally foreign to traditional western academic study of history. \n\nAnd for the record, I think it's an absolutely batshit reading of history. It requires believing things like: the Soviet Union was a crypto colony of the United Kingdom and that the USSR was specifically set up and allowed by Western governments in order to suppress Russian nationalism. And it certainly requires believing that the existence of independent states like Ukraine, but also like the Baltic States and even the existence of a Poland outside of Moscow's influence is not the legitimate expression of popular sentiment, but a perversion of the natural order of geopolitics created by a centuries long anti-Russian conspiracy led by the United States and the United Kingdom. And to that extent, i think if you dug into it a little bit more, you'd find a decent amount of anti-Semitism when you ask the question of which people in the United States and United Kingdom were the responsible parties for setting these things up.\n\nIf I could speak good enough Russian to actually read some of Putin's discography and relay a better understanding of these things to the west, I'd be trying to get published. But I don't. I rely on the translations I've had, but I really don't think popular western psychoanalysis of Putin comes anywhere close to understanding who he actually is or what he's actually after.",

And I think the eventual goal of all of this is that Putin believes putting all of these puzzle pieces together will make the Russian federation a leading global superpower that can compete with the United States and the European Union, and possibly exceed them because the Russian state will be organized under a strongman who can take dedicated action on behalf of the Russian nation, and not be politically paralyzed by the forces of liberal democracy.</p>\n\n<p>I also don&#39;t think a lot of people have really dug in very much to the ideological underpinnings of this. I very much think, the more I&#39;ve read translations of Putin at least, that he really does conflate the forces of European colonialism, the Nazi regime during the Second World War, the Soviet Union which he both admires and despises, and the modern institution of NATO and liberal Western democracy in general. </p>\n\n<p>In that sense, I think he&#39;s a lot like Osama Bin Laden, who Western governments and media described for decades as somebody motivated purely by fanatical hatred for western freedom, and not to say he was a great guy or anything, but when you actually listened to what he complained about, he talked more about things like Sykes-Picot and the establishment of mandatory Palestine than anything else. Putin&#39;s worldview and his actions are driven by a very specific and tailored view of history that is not covered at all in English language media, and is totally foreign to traditional western academic study of history. </p>\n\n<p>And for the record, I think it&#39;s an absolutely batshit reading of history. It requires believing things like: the Soviet Union was a crypto colony of the United Kingdom and that the USSR was specifically set up and allowed by Western governments in order to suppress Russian nationalism. And it certainly requires believing that the existence of independent states like Ukraine, but also like the Baltic States and even the existence of a Poland outside of Moscow&#39;s influence is not the legitimate expression of popular sentiment, but a perversion of the natural order of geopolitics created by a centuries long anti-Russian conspiracy led by the United States and the United Kingdom. And to that extent, i think if you dug into it a little bit more, you&#39;d find a decent amount of anti-Semitism when you ask the question of which people in the United States and United Kingdom were the responsible parties for setting these things up.</p>\n\n<p>If I could speak good enough Russian to actually read some of Putin&#39;s discography and relay a better understanding of these things to the west, I&#39;d be trying to get published. But I don&#39;t. I rely on the translations I&#39;ve had, but I really don&#39;t think popular western psychoanalysis of Putin comes anywhere close to understanding who he actually is or what he&#39;s actually after.</p>\n</div>",

Putin has ragged on about the power of the dollar for almost all of his career and how a lot of countries are beholden to west, etc. if you want to disconnect from that, doing it peacefully is pretty much impossible; waging a self-destructive war might work though, and even with that it's not a guarantee. \n\nIf you look at the global world order, countries that have a lot of sovereignty(can decide about political, military, economic, etc. measures) tend to have less economic freedom/integration. The only exception to this are the strongest countries, so USA definitely qualifies, with maybe China too. But even for those two, they tend to sacrifice some sovereignty for economical integration.\n\nFor example a country like Belgium or Luxembourg has a lot of economic integration / freedom, but very little sovereignty; they follow the institutions they are a part of and don't have much say themselves. On the other extreme you have countries like Cuba or North Korea which have a lot of state sovereignty, but very little economic integration or freedom. In general, the higher the economic integration the better a country performs, but the more it is beholden to international institutions and rules.\n\nAgain, I think it's unlikely; but it's possible Putin wants for his regime to be more like North Korea. It consolidates power, makes oligarchs less prone to outside influence, etc. I'd point to two pieces of evidence that it's not so unlikely that Putin didn't know what would happen, big warnings came from Russian military 1-2 months before invasion already happened. One is from Mikhail Khodarenok who is a military analyst, journalist and colonel; and nowadays works for Russia's state TV; so an inside man. The other one came from Leonid Ivashov who was the general who oversaw the Kosovo situation among others, but 'retired' after Putin came to power, he is a harsh Putin critic.

He was a filmmaker assigned to follow and report on Putin in his first year in office. It's stunning as it shows a very unsure of himself young man. One scene i never forget is Putin put back the old Soviet anthem i believe for the military, changing the words but keeping the music. Yeltsin was agaisnt it. \n\nThere's one scene where Putin asks the filmmaker what he thinks about it. As if Putin himself isn't sure what's been done is the right decision. When the filmmaker who is an abrasive man confronts Putin, saying he's agaisnt it, Putin defends himself poorly. He seems almost shaken. I never forgot that scene.",

That gives you an overview of Putin and his early involvement in the &quot;circus&quot; of the 90s and how he emerges from it. </p>\n\n<p>The other one i just found. Putin&#39;s Witnesses by Vitaly Mansky. He was a filmmaker assigned to follow and report on Putin in his first year in office. It&#39;s stunning as it shows a very unsure of himself young man. One scene i never forget is Putin put back the old Soviet anthem i believe for the military, changing the words but keeping the music. Yeltsin was agaisnt it. </p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s one scene where Putin asks the filmmaker what he thinks about it. As if Putin himself isn&#39;t sure what&#39;s been done is the right decision. When the filmmaker who is an abrasive man confronts Putin, saying he&#39;s agaisnt it, Putin defends himself poorly. He seems almost shaken. I never forgot that scene.</p>\n</div>",

It may seem to the Western audience that I am justifying or sympathizing with Putin, but, as an analyst, I try to understand the internal incentives, motivation, and logic of political figures. Whether we like it or not, Putin believes that he serves Russia\u2019s national interests, even if the way he does it harms Russia more than it helps.\n\n> Through this prism, he makes a clear distinction between a right and good opposition and a destructive and hostile opposition. If we look objectively, Yevgeny Prigozhin, with all his public activities during the year, has politically damaged the regime perhaps much more than Alexey Navalny, the jailed opposition leader, has. Prigozhin is much more politically dangerous. He has split \u00e9lites, attacked the pillars of the regime, such as the army, and challenged Putin\u2019s appointees, and even the Presidential administration, using his own armed militias, and his media allies. He has a much more radical agenda than is usually allowed to spread in the informational space. And yet, he remains untouchable, thanks only to Putin personally.\n\n> The main difference between Navalny and Prigozhin, in Putin\u2019s eyes, is that the former has destructive intentions to ruin Russia and is often used as a tool in the hands of Russia\u2019s strategic enemies\u2014the West. Prigozhin, however destructive he may appear, is guided by pro-Russian priorities and best wishes. In other words, Putin sees Navalny as a betrayer and Prigozhin as a genuine patriot.

For a significant part of the Russian mainstream \u00e9lite, Prigozhin, together with \u201cangry patriots,\u201d as domestic-policy overseers in the Kremlin call them, represent a genuine threat that needs to be curtailed. This is another division between Putin and the \u00e9lites. Many in the leadership believe that Prigozhin is dangerous for the regime, from technocrats who are just horrified by him, to the F.S.B., which consider him a threat. Yet Putin allows him to be. I would not exaggerate the level of Putin\u2019s positive attitude toward Prigozhin, but he sees him as a genuine hero who is sometimes clumsy and goes too far, and needs to be reined in due to his often-emotional outbursts. But he is not an enemy, and deserves to have his own place in the system, regardless of what others think.\n\nIf the second explanation is correct, then Girkin also has the liberty to critique, provided he continues to support the war (killing Ukrainians and annexing some new territory).",

Past the point of no return even the people who fostered it lose control over it, and it becomes a thing of its own.\n\nI should really take the time to make a full 5k word writeup on this one of these days, but today isn't that day.  \n\nI mean let's start with the obvious - everyone's obsessed with the US, it's the freaking US.  It's the big kid in the yard, love them or hate them geopolitical discourse is always going to involve them.\n\nFrom the Russian perspective, the US is the first one to have \"meaningfully\" defeated us since the Mongols (and then the US cheated, they couldn't beat us on the battlefield, they had to get Gorbachev hooked on pizza hut!).  It's why all but the most ardent vatniks can stomach being called the \"2nd best army in the world\".  The americans are richer and eviler than us, of course they have a stronger army, after all.  \n\nI'm being a little snide but the point is that even relatively aggressive Russians perceive America as a legitimate adversary, in some cases the only legitimate adversary on the planet (the newer generation are starting to take China more seriously, but every other nation is basically considered a vassal in waiting).\n\nThere's also an element of jealousy.  Basically ever since the mongols Russia dreamed of not having neighbours, this has always and will always be a central motivation to any Russian governments behavior.  And well, America's basically the incarnation of that ideal, America doesn't have neighbours, not really.  And look how rich, safe, and arrogant they get to be!\n\nWhile obviously these feelings aren't always as hostile, no matter how relations are going America's always going to be a unique entity in the Kremlin mindset (to be fair, that's true of most nations on the globe, just for different reasons).\n\nAnyway, this is important because also this causes some Russians (especially the ones in the Kremlin right now) to presume that any poor relations with any of their neighbours are uniquely the machinations of the US.  Their alienation from Europe is solely due to American hegemony there, and as soon as America is somehow defeated Europe will become Russia-friendly.  And I assure you, they care about this alienation immensely.  No matter what you hear about \"oh we'll just pivot to India or China\", Russia considers itself a vital European state, in some cases **the** vital European state.  If all of Europe hates them, well clearly that means America's got them all conquered, and this both must and will be remedied... at some point.  And that'll be the natural order of things.\n\nIt's also (especially the part about the \"only legitimate adversary\") whether or not anti-NATO Russians think this war is winnable or not entirely depends on whether they think the war is with Ukraine or with the US.  Those who think it's ultimately a war with Ukraine literally cannot conceive of losing to them.  Those who think it's primarily against the US either think it's an uphill battle or a lost cause.\n\nAnyway, this is just a few considerations.  As a disclaimer, I'm mainly zeroing in on the type of Russian that would be obsessed with the US right now.  Like, there was plenty of legitimate goodwill towards the US after the cold war from certain Russians.  There still is, but mostly from expats at this point.  It's basically just a poorly organized list of things that rattle around in the Russian mindset about the US.  It's not remotely comprehensive.",

Ukraine has obviously made gains on the flanks, which came about through counterattacks.\n\nThere are multiple possible reasons:\n\n1. Force Russia to commit reserves. The Ukrainian deputy MoD thinks they've committed \"most of their reserves\" to hold the flanks. I'm skeptical that's accurate, but we know for a fact they committed some important units, like the well equipped 10th Tank Regt of the 3rd Army. That's nominally nearly a hundred T-80s and T-90s that won't be used to stop a counteroffensive.\n\n2. Force Russia to either defend Bakhmut or lose it. Russian troops defending Bakhmut proper aren't defending Zaporizhzhia. If Russia prioritizes Zaporizhzhia too much, then they could place Bakhmut in a precarious position and lose it. This would be devastating to Russian morale.\n\n3. Take advantage of any disruption caused by Wagner's withdrawal. If Prigozhin takes his ball and goes home, Russia will be forced to hurriedly send a substantial number of troops to the area. Such a large troop rotation is easy to take advantage of.\n\n4. Take better ground to ensure the best possible defense against further advance. Remember, Bakhmut was just the next step to Slovyansk and Kramatorsk. Ukraine wants to keep Russia as far away from those cities as possible. The local counterattacks have concentrated on taking high ground that overlooks the Bakhmut valley. This makes it substantially easier to defend against further Russian offensives on this axis.\n\n5. Positioning for possible counteroffensives of their own.

Your question has been answered by multiple people in the May 18th thread, but here's my take:\n\nIf you look at the topographical map, Bakhmut city proper is on the low ground, and the flanks are on high ground. Cutting the flanks allows Ukrainians to prevent Russian forces from having full control of the area, which in turn makes further offensive action more difficult. Taking Bakhmut without flanks has much less value (arguably, almost none). I'd also assume that only controlling low ground makes it a lot easier for Ukraine to target Russian staging points in the city proper.",

It appears that the nature and severity of the incident may play a role, as evidenced by past cyberattacks attributed to Russia and the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, both of which did not result in the activation of Article 5. Additionally, even when Article 5 is invoked, it seems that individual member countries retain discretion in their response, as not all NATO members joined the military efforts in Afghanistan following the 9/11 attacks. Furthermore, some sources suggest that the U.S. Congress must authorize military action in cases where Article 5 is triggered by a non-American country. This raises questions about the potential implications of a NATO member attacking a non-member country and the subsequent retaliation. Some argue that the necessity of congressional approval serves to prevent the U.S. from being drawn into a global conflict should --for example-- the Baltic states initiate hostilities.\r  \n\r  \nIn light of the recent decision to supply jets to Ukraine, I would like to ask about the implications of this action, particularly considering the maintenance requirements of F-16s, which reportedly necessitate 17 hours of maintenance for every flight hour. This would demand ground crew with years of experience and a well-established logistical network. Furthermore, stationing F-16s in Ukraine could potentially expose them to Russian missile attacks. Bearing in mind that Poland has not hosted Ukrainian fighter aircraft, could there be an underlying rationale for this decision? Additionally, would the operation of aircraft from Polish airbases by Ukrainian pilots involve Poland in the conflict to such an extent that an attack on these airbases would not invoke Article 5?",
