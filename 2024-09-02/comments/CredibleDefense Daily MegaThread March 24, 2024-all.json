Putin effectively has full control and there is little to be gained from such an operation.\n* Putin's actions in ignoring US security warnings were 'churlish' and 'stupid'. It's not known how actionable such intel from the US was. There have been, however, increased police operations in Moscow recently, including one at the target venue the week before.

The real weaknesses tend to stem from the security apparatus of their Central Asian partners who Russia have to rely on for HUMINT.

The ongoing three-month campaign to undermine Moscow\u2019s fuel production capacity has been successful, with about 7% of Russia\u2019s refining capacity idling in the first quarter of 2024.*\n\n*Ukrainian defense conglomerate Ukroboronprom publicly announced the development of the Liutyi in October 2022. The firm said it intended to create an attack drone weighing over 200 kg, capable of carrying a 75 kg warhead at a distance of more than 1,000 km. It is the first Ukrainian system analogous to Iran\u2019s Shahed-136 suicide drones in terms of payload, range, and autonomous attack ability.*\n\n*The new drone was a response to the requirements laid out in early August by then-Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Valerii Zaluzhnyi. When unveiling an element of the Liutyi\u2019s fuselage, Ukroboronprom included the biblical inscription \u201cAz Vozdam\u201d (Old Slavonic for \u201cI will repay,\u201d referring to the Bible\u2019s Romans 12:19) \u2013 a sign indicating forthcoming retaliatory strikes against Russian assets. The name Lityi, in turn, means fierce/furious or February in Ukrainian.*\n\n* *In December 2022, Ukroboronprom said a combat drone it was developing had passed \u201ca number of stages of successful testing\u201d and was moving to the stage of testing under electronic warfare.*\n\n* *A year later, on 16 November 2023, the Minister of Strategic Industries Oleksandr Kamyshin stated that Ukraine had entered into mass production of strike drones analogous to Iran\u2019s Shahed-136 loitering munitions. Referring to what was known as the \u201cUkrainian Shahed,\u201d Kamyshin said Ukraine was now manufacturing \u201ctens per month\u201d but did not disclose the name. The Ukroboronprom CEO confirmed the beginning of the drone\u2019s mass production.*\n* *In June 2023, Ukroboronprom announced the successful completion of a 1,000 km trial for the drone. Ukrainska Pravda speculated, referring to its sources, that the effective employment of the Ukroboronprom\u2019s UAV occurred on 3 May 2023, when an attack caused a fire at a Russian oil depot in Volna settlement on Russia\u2019s Taman peninsula next to Crimea, some 250 kilometers from the frontline.*\n\n*Militarnyi has learned from its own sources that the Liutyi\u2019s approximate cost is twice as much as the previous Bober (\u201cBeaver\u201d) attack drone. The latter is known to have been purchased by Serhii Prytula\u2019s Foundation for 4 million UAH per unit (about $100,000).*\n\n*The Liutyi represents a step up in Ukrainian drone technology and offensive reach. It is an unmanned low-wing monoplane powered by a gasoline engine and equipped with an advanced satellite-aided inertial guidance system for autonomous navigation over long distances.*\n\n*In the initial stages of the Liutiy drone project, there were claims that the drone would serve as a versatile platform, but it\u2019s unclear from publicly available information whether this goal was achieved, or if the Liutiy was solely deployed as a one-time kamikaze drone, Defense Express says.*\n\n*Based on open information and multiple photos of the wreckage shared by Russians from the first three months of the Liutyi\u2019s deployment in 2024, its design and capabilities can be analyzed in depth. The unmanned low-wing monoplane has a 6.7-meter wingspan and 4.4-meter length, with a maximum takeoff weight between 250-300 kg. The drone boasts aerodynamics optimized for extended range.*\n\n*Its pusher configuration sees a gasoline piston engine with a three-blade propeller installed in the rear fuselage. This weight distribution likely allows for a heavy explosive warhead in the nose. The drone has a fixed undercarriage for takeoffs and landings from roads or runways.*\n\n*The sleek aerodynamic fuselage with winglets aids in maximizing range. It mounts a pitot tube under the nose for measuring airspeed and altitude. The composite fuselage uses fiberglass, epoxy resin, metal mesh, and wood for stiffness.*\n\n*To ease logistics, the Liutyi breaks down into major components \u2013 the nose section with the warhead, fuel tank, and engine; removable wings; and empennage attaching near the engine nacelles.*\n\n*The wreckage of the Ukrainian drone\u2019s engine shares design similarities with the German Hirth F-23 50hp aviation engine, estimated to cost around $5,000. Militarnyi notes that distinctive cylinder heads, mounts, and electrical features match this commercial piston engine model.*\n\n*The Liutyi\u2019s thick-walled steel warhead casing weighs approximately 50 kg, according to Russian sources, down from Ukroboronprom\u2019s initial 75 kg claim, but this precision-guided munition has proved more than adequate to wreak havoc on Russian infrastructure. Its bladed exterior suggests enhanced forced fragmentation over a penetrating shaped charge.*\n\n*Other features like attachment rings point to it being crane-loaded into the drone\u2019s nose section right before launch, implying a modular design. However, the initiation system seems deficient based on the number of intact unexploded warheads found.*\n\n*The most significant advancement is Liutyi\u2019s improved inertial guidance aided by satellite signals. All previous Ukrainian strike drones relied solely on this traditional system susceptible to jamming and navigation drift.*\n\n*By enhancing the satellite antenna\u2019s shielding and likely adding backup data links, the Liutyi displayed pinpoint accuracy in striking exact components from over 1000 km away during night bombardment runs into Russia.*\n\n*The drone platform\u2019s modular design allows it to be broken down for easier transportation and logistics. Its fairly compact size, when disassembled, permits launch from improvised sites like roads, rather than requiring dedicated airstrips. This operational flexibility enhances survivability and complicates Russian countermeasures.*\n\n*Drone strikes crippled the Yakovlev Explosives Plant in Dzerzhinsk, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, \u2013 a producer of explosive materials for Russian munitions. Other drones hit the Lipetsk Metallurgical Combine, disrupting some steel supplies.*\n\n*Militarnyi believes the warhead\u2019s bladed casing design, rather than a penetrating shaped charge, indicates an intent to inflict widespread fragmentation damage ideal for wrecking machinery and inflicting casualties in the open.*\n\n*Since early 2024, flights of 2-6 Liutyis executed over a dozen strikes on strategic Russian sites up to 800 km inside Russia\u2019s territory. Nine oil refineries had specific refining units accurately struck, while the Novolipetsk Steel Plant and Nizhny Novgorod explosives factory were also hit.*\n\n*Two Ukrainian agencies \u2013 the Defense Intelligence Directorate (HUR) and the SBU security service \u2013 are coordinating these drone operations, according to Ukrainska Pravda sources. SBU markings on one warhead indicate its special operations personnel have access to the drones.*\n\n*The long reach has given Ukraine the ability to degrade Russia\u2019s strategic depth and industrial potential, while Liutyi\u2019s ongoing mass production will only sustain and intensify the bombardment.*\n\nArticle contains a full list of strikes if you are interested.",

At minimum the kinetic hit to basic infrastructure like water, the grid,, transportation/roads, and civilians is enough to put them out of order for a while if not a long time  and at worst,  if their facilities end up directly hit by an errant missile or round (I don't think China or the US would actually deliberately target them initially but who knows) then it's even worse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn really either case beyond the blockade, it will be a migraine beyond belief economically - COVID is a stretching exercise by comparison. TSMC has geographically diversified a bit, and has some future plans to diversify more via Japan, the US, and Germany in that order, but ultimately most of their leading edge and primary volume is in Taiwan at *four* \"giga\" fabs where giga = 100K+ monthly wafer capacity, as opposed to the \"mega\" fab in Arizona which really is like 25-50K on capacity for monthly wafers alone (and also behind a node even today, and it's not operational yet). And it will stay this way, by design. TSMC's dominance in the leading edge is also stronger now than ever by revenues or client shares, while Samsung and Intel are the only other leading edge fabs, though hardly out of the game at all yet thankfully.

World cut off from Russia, Russia cut off from world. I mentioned GDP for a simple comparison, and like I said we could look at import/export numbers similarly. Of course that doesn't tell the full story and unfortunately a serious analysis is outside of the scope of a reddit comment\n\nBut consider the importance of supply chains and how interconnected everything is. Something like 90% of advanced computer chips come from Taiwan. In any war between China and the US, there would be a massive supply shock in many industries - computer chips being one.\n\nAnd since everything is digital these days, it would cause all sorts of knock off effects that simply weren't there with Russia.

Every single tank destroyed is a temporarily reduction in Russian tank capability (that may take years to be replaced, but the war is also likely to last that long), but any ship loss is a loss for good.

A Western politician will certainly sleep better when they know that the donation makes with their signature on it made a concrete and visible impact on Russian warfighting capability rather than &quot;Storm Shadow delays the fall of Avdivka from December into February&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Non-fungible, because the Montreux Convention makes it that Russia can&#39;t replenish those with ships from the Baltic/Pacific, and I believe their naval shipbuilding capacity in the Black Sea is very limited. Every single tank destroyed is a temporarily reduction in Russian tank capability (that may take years to be replaced, but the war is also likely to last that long), but any ship loss is a loss for good. That also counts for some of the items with similar limited inventory and difficulties in replacement like the A-50 which destruction caused significant ruckus. Otoh, fighters/bombers, ammo and C2 nodes are far more replaceable.</p>\n</div>",

One of Ukraine's main goals is definitely to reduce the amount of missile carriers in the Black Sea, although it's true that actually the biggest limitation at the moment is the number of available missiles. \n\nThe issue is that the Black Sea Fleet has some regenerative capacity, although things are not very rosy either. At the moment, according to Ukrainian sources, the currently operational platforms that can carry out attacks with Kalibrs from the Black Sea are 2 frigates, 4 corvettes, and 2 submarines - all of which are in Novorossiysk (and often act from the waters to the east of the base), with the exception of the \"Tsiklon\" corvette, which also acts as an anti-air defense platform for the naval base of Sevastopol...\n\nIn December 2023, the Karakurt-class \"Tucha\" corvette was received: it's capable of accommodating up to 8 Kalibr-NKs; it was manufactured by Zelenodolsk Shipyard in Tatarstan and arrived via the Volga-Don channel. Right now it's undergoing trials in Novorossiysk and will have to replace the \"Askold\" corvette which is under repair in Kerch after being heavily damaged last year. \n\nIn the same month the \"Amur\" corvette, built by Zaliv Shipbuilding Yard in Kerch, was received too. In this case, however, there were problems with the radar and communication systems, which delayed substantially its entry into service. This ship is at the naval base in Novorossiysk, where the Russians are fixing the ship's radar system and, like the \"Tucha\", should enter service in the coming weeks or months. \n\nDuring 2024 the \"Typhoon\" corvette should also be received, from the Zelenodolsk Shipyard.\n\nSo broadly speaking, the number of missile carriers is limited, but there are some replacements incoming, and given where the ships usually operate, it will not be easy to significantly reduce that fleet. There is also the option for the Russians, difficult but technically possible (they have done so in the past in several instances), to employ Kalibrs against Ukraine from their corvettes in the Caspian Sea.\n\nIn addition, as far as landing ships are concerned, repairs of the Ropucha-class \"Konstantin Olshansky\" have recently started. This ship was captured in 2014 from the Southern Naval Base of the Ukrainian Navy, during the seizure of Crimea.",

        "body": "Some information on the results of the attacks on the refinery. In short, the system has a large margin of safety, the drop in production is only 4 percent so far.\n\nAccording to Kommersant, Russian oil companies kept the volume of gasoline supplies to the domestic market in mid-March, despite drone attacks on a number of refineries. At the same time, gasoline production decreased by about 4%. The difference is covered by accumulated reserves, the level of which is still significantly higher than a year ago. The total volume of refining at Russian refineries has decreased by February by only 0.5% so far. However, the statistics have not yet reflected the effect of a decrease in output at the Samara Group refineries, including the attack on the Kuibyshev refinery.\n\nGasoline production in Russia for the week of March 13-19 fell by 3.9% compared to the previous week and by 5.2% relative to the production plan \u2014 to 779.4 thousand tons (111.3 thousand tons per day), Kommersant's interlocutors familiar with the statistics say. The minimum production volume was marked on March 18 \u2014 104.7 thousand tons per day. This is the first week when the release of gasoline was affected by drone attacks on Nizhny Novgorod, Ryazan and Syzran refineries.\n\nDespite the decrease in production, gasoline supplies to the domestic market for the reporting week even increased slightly compared to the previous one \u2014 by 0.3%, to 794.2 thousand tons. Shipments exceeded output by 2%.\n\nOil companies closed the difference due to gasoline reserves at refineries and oil depots.\n\nStocks decreased by 1.5% (25.5 thousand tons) compared to the previous week, but still amount to almost 2 million tons. Due to the introduction of a ban on gasoline exports from March 1, its reserves, despite the reduction in production, are still 153 thousand tons higher than a year ago.\n\nGasoline production has declined amid attacks by Ukrainian drones on Russian refineries. So, on March 12, drones damaged the primary oil refining unit at the Nizhny Novgorod LUKOIL refinery, later disabled two such units at the Ryazan refinery and one at the Syzran Refinery (both owned by Rosneft).\n\nAs a result of the drone attack on March 23, the primary processing plant at the Kuibyshev refinery of Rosneft caught fire. \"There has been no damage to the technological equipment,\" Dmitry Azarov, Governor of the Samara Region, assured. The effect of the attacks on the Samara Group's refineries will be clear from the statistics for the next week.\n\nOil refining in March, according to Kommersant, is 722.6 thousand tons per day, which is 0.5% less than the February level.\n\nThe Ministry of Energy expects that the decrease in oil refining at a number of plants will be offset by its increase at other refineries. Meanwhile, oil companies increased oil exports in March. As factories enter traditional spring repairs in the coming weeks, recycling rates may continue to decline.\n\nThe cost of gasoline at SPBMTSB has been rising for the last two weeks. Thus, on March 22, Ai-95 stock quotes in the European part of the Russian Federation increased by 0.7%, to 66.9 thousand rubles per ton.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak held a regular meeting with oil companies on March 22, during which he instructed oil companies, together with Russian Railways, to \"ensure uninterrupted export of petroleum products and loading of refineries in accordance with the schedule and growing spring demand.\"\n\nData on daily gasoline output show that the consequences of attacks by Ukrainian drones \"have so far turned out to be less significant than the preliminary analysis showed, suggesting a decrease in output by 12-13%,\" notes Sergey Kondratiev from the Institute of Energy and Finance. According to his forecasts, by the end of March, output is likely to be 135-140 thousand tons, or 4% lower than planned, which, taking into account the available reserves, will avoid a shortage in the domestic market.\n\nThe market situation in April, Mr. Kondratiev believes, will depend on how quickly it will be possible to put the damaged installations back into operation and additionally load other refineries.",

Two years ago (without even having a tenth of today's air defense systems, weapons and experience of full-scale war!) With all this, we understood perfectly well how important it was to disrupt the mobilization in Russia. They rejoiced at every military enlistment office set on fire there, rejoiced at the queues of their draft dodgers who fled in panic to Georgia and Kazakhstan,\" Pavlyuk said.\n\nHe accused \"bloggers and the media\" of allegedly helping to destroy the unity and cohesion of Ukrainians by publishing reports \"about the unfortunate drowned in the Yew Tree\" or about \"detachments of fighting Hutsuls\" (talking about the fight against military commissars in the Carpathians \u2014 Ed.).\n\n...",

She said that on the evening of March 15, employees of the draft board forcibly pushed her husband into a minibus, tearing his jacket, breaking his glasses and phone, and then handed him a summons \u00abretroactively\u00bb. By the morning of March 16, an order for his mobilization was already prepared, the woman claimed. The head of the Lviv Regional Territorial Recruitment Center, Artur Niyazov, subsequently announced that an investigation had been launched.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pravda-en.com/world/2024/03/24/386182.html\">https://pravda-en.com/world/2024/03/24/386182.html</a></p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>He accused Ukrainians of changing their mood about serving in the army..</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Let&#39;s remember what was written and distributed in our social networks two years ago and compare it with what it is now. From queues at the shopping mall and memes &quot;how to serve is all sick, but how to fight is all healthy&quot;, we have reached the harassment of the military from the shopping mall (analogous to Russian military enlistment offices - Ed.) and moral support for evading the protection of Ukraine. Two years ago (without even having a tenth of today&#39;s air defense systems, weapons and experience of full-scale war!) With all this, we understood perfectly well how important it was to disrupt the mobilization in Russia. They rejoiced at every military enlistment office set on fire there, rejoiced at the queues of their draft dodgers who fled in panic to Georgia and Kazakhstan,&quot; Pavlyuk said.</p>\n\n<p>He accused &quot;bloggers and the media&quot; of allegedly helping to destroy the unity and cohesion of Ukrainians by publishing reports &quot;about the unfortunate drowned in the Yew Tree&quot; or about &quot;detachments of fighting Hutsuls&quot; (talking about the fight against military commissars in the Carpathians \u2014 Ed.).</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n</div>",

They lose more people in a single day in Ukraine so why do they think killing ~100 civilians and setting fire to some building in Moscow is gonna accomplish something? Do they think Putin cares?\n\nThe deaths of civilians in the heart of Russia are much more important than the deaths of soldiers on the front lines. In fact, even the civilians in the peripheral cities (like Belgorod) are less important.\n\nThe Russian people care about this, it's the number one news in Russia.\n\nPutin is supposed to be the guarantor of stability. The Crocus City Hall attack is a smudge on his image. Especially in the context of him wasting resources on a pointless war.\n\nThat's why Russia is *desperately* trying to pin this on Ukraine. The government wants to show that the war is not pointless, on the contrary, only defeating Ukraine will stop the terrorist attacks.\n\nFor example, this is the top article on TASS right now: \"US bails Ukraine out after Moscow attack, covering Zelensky with ISIS \u2014 diplomat\" tass(.)com/world/1765181",
