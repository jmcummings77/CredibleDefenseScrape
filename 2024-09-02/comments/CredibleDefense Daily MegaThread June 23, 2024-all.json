What has the impact been on Putin, what effects has it had on the war and Wagner long term? How do people feel about what happened with the benefit of hindsight, what are your thoughts as to why it went down like it did and whether it could have gone a different route?\n\nFor me the obvious thing is that a lot of Wagner\u2019s methods have been just directly incorporated into the russian army anyways. Also the tight grip that russia now exerts over the milbloggers, which has had the effect of pretty clearly concealing a lot of the criticism of the war effort we used to see. Pretty much all of them have been clamped down on, which perhaps goes some way to explaining the ever more ludicrous claims I see being peddled by believers of their propaganda (I\u2019ve had people repeatedly claim that entire Ukrainian *brigades* have been annihilated in battle, and then months later they\u2019ll say \u201c4 Ukrainian brigades have deserted or surrendered!!!\u201d without any consideration for the last 20 claims of mass defeat they made). Obviously those claims were always there, but if you were following russian bloggers you got a mix of the insane propaganda and \u201cactually this isn\u2019t going to well\u201d beforehand.\n\nAnother noticeable thing to me is how it feels like russia has intentionally tried to bury the whole thing. Which makes sense. Putin can\u2019t exactly pretend it was the magical CIA colour revolution he\u2019s spent the last few decades shitting himself over, it was entirely the fault of russian government actions and decisions and it got closer than anyone has ever been to removing him from power. So the entire thing has been papered over and ignored.\n\nAlso, let\u2019s just remember some of the funnier moments from it, like the russian government desperately dumping piles of soil onto the roads or parking trucks on motorways in an attempt to create roadblocks. Or the Chechen TikTok Battalions getting stuck in a traffic jam while supposedly attempting to pursue Wagner, as Wagner shot down multiple expensive planes and helicopters packed with important officers. Or the entire thing being resolved by *Lukashenko* of all people.

However, by the point he made the deal he\u2019d reached a large river south of Moscow\u2026. And SF forces loyal to Putin held all the bridges in force.

In a nuclear first strike it's doubtful these conventional forces would be of much use anyways. Especially if the North strikes all major airfields with nukes first. \n\n>Then why is NK spending 25% of GDP on defense, have million plus active duty soldiers most of which are forward deployed near DMZ?\n\nMaybe because like most totalitarian regimes, to distract ordinary citizens from looking too closely at their living situations, they want to direct their citizens' attention towards enemies that present an existential threat to North Korea's way of life? And to back up this propaganda you also need to show people that you are serious about deterring threats from these enemies by having a large and visible military? \n\nFurther, a large military staffed by conscripts makes it easy to control a portion of the population at any given time. \n\n>It might just be a rhetoric for North Korean internal consumption only but for South Koreans, they need have an insurance even for that unlikely scenario b/c not being prepared for all eventualities have an outsized negative consequences.\n\nPeople have been talking about the DMZ going hot for decades and decades now and it still hasn't gotten hot since 1953, barring a few small armed confrontations here and there. North Korea outright launching nukes against the ROK and/or the US is outright an impossibility given that such a move would lead to the regime's dissolution. North Korea may have ambitions of reuniting the Korean peninsula but can it make that a reality without provoking the United States or risking a military defeat with South Korea?\n\nNuclear brinksmanship goes both ways. If North Korea threatens South Korea with nukes, we know they are bluffing because a first strike from NK would result in MAD.",

And to back up this propaganda you also need to show people that you are serious about deterring threats from these enemies by having a large and visible military? </p>\n\n<p>Further, a large military staffed by conscripts makes it easy to control a portion of the population at any given time. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It might just be a rhetoric for North Korean internal consumption only but for South Koreans, they need have an insurance even for that unlikely scenario b/c not being prepared for all eventualities have an outsized negative consequences.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>People have been talking about the DMZ going hot for decades and decades now and it still hasn&#39;t gotten hot since 1953, barring a few small armed confrontations here and there. North Korea outright launching nukes against the ROK and/or the US is outright an impossibility given that such a move would lead to the regime&#39;s dissolution. North Korea may have ambitions of reuniting the Korean peninsula but can it make that a reality without provoking the United States or risking a military defeat with South Korea?</p>\n\n<p>Nuclear brinksmanship goes both ways. If North Korea threatens South Korea with nukes, we know they are bluffing because a first strike from NK would result in MAD.</p>\n</div>",

(Flatly denying it ever happened is false, as 2 were convicted in the past. But in context, today, of course it's not a rule violation.) Claiming it's SOP without a substantial amount of evidence (when we even have a lot of combat footage) beggars belief. Even with evidence, this is not the place to litigate such things with aggressive back and forth. Three things interfere with insightful, dispassionate discourse here:\n\n- believing might makes right leads to painting your side as stronger, ignoring the truth, problems which need reform etc. With such a view, an even handed search for truth is a political act supporting their enemies. If /u/glideer posted here, it means we are platforming Russia. Or if someone criticizes US procurement, it means we are communists platforming the CCP. Or if someone criticizes the Ukrainian offensive, it hurts morale and destroys Ukraine's future. To me, this represents a collapse of enlightenment values and something far more profound, where objective truth itself is a foreign concept to many.\n- litigating debates for moral points, to paint one side as just, on the right side of history etc. which is irrelevant here. If we want to understand horse archers, we don't care about Mongolian atrocities. If we want to understand COIN, we use examples from nationalist, communist, anticommunist, Islamic, Christian etc. insurgencies. We shouldn't throw out insights, because of our parallel personal beliefs.\n- missing the forest for the trees, arguing one interpretation of minutiae instead of exercising curiosity to explore a topic and understand contours of different positions. This is why individual pieces of combat footage are a no go. We want to weave data points together into a holistic picture like a mosaic of many stones. Leaping to assigning additional meaning to a stone (e.g. this person on the hood) weakens everything around.\n\nSearching for the truth, we must wade through yellow journalism, fake news, spin jobs, ideologically motivated actors etc. on every side. Summarized in the rules as:\n\n> not wage wars behind keyboards\n\n------\n\nPersonally, I think both sides are bad, in different ways. War crime or not doesn't matter. Plenty of heinous acts don't constitute a war crime, while ok things do (e.g. publishing PoW interviews, because of the potential implications.)",

We shouldn&#39;t throw out insights, because of our parallel personal beliefs.</li>\n<li>missing the forest for the trees, arguing one interpretation of minutiae instead of exercising curiosity to explore a topic and understand contours of different positions. This is why individual pieces of combat footage are a no go. We want to weave data points together into a holistic picture like a mosaic of many stones. Leaping to assigning additional meaning to a stone (e.g. this person on the hood) weakens everything around.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Searching for the truth, we must wade through yellow journalism, fake news, spin jobs, ideologically motivated actors etc. on every side.

War crime or not doesn&#39;t matter. Plenty of heinous acts don&#39;t constitute a war crime, while ok things do (e.g. publishing PoW interviews, because of the potential implications.)</p>\n</div>",

Very long and very dark article which explores the systemic dysfunction of the military to pay even the bare minimum of attention to the well-being of its own soldiers. A kid who did everything he could to get help but ended up dead. \n\n> Valley was one of at least 158 active-duty Army soldiers to die by suicide in 2023. According to the investigative-journalism nonprofit Voice of San Diego, young men in the military are more likely to die by suicide than their civilian peers, reflecting a suicide rate that has risen steadily since the Army began tracking it 20 years ago. That these deaths are occurring within a peacetime military contradicts a common misperception that soldier suicide is closely linked to PTSD from combat.

Very long and very dark article which explores the systemic dysfunction of the military to pay even the bare minimum of attention to the well-being of its own soldiers. A kid who did everything he could to get help but ended up dead. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Valley was one of at least 158 active-duty Army soldiers to die by suicide in 2023. According to the investigative-journalism nonprofit Voice of San Diego, young men in the military are more likely to die by suicide than their civilian peers, reflecting a suicide rate that has risen steadily since the Army began tracking it 20 years ago. That these deaths are occurring within a peacetime military contradicts a common misperception that soldier suicide is closely linked to PTSD from combat.

If the US were to take path 3, then the critics would be even more angry and likely resort to moral arguments that they still wouldn't apply to their own \"camp\". \n\nThe context of this kind of criticism is decidedly consequentialist, in that the charges of hypocrisy are intended to bolster the rhetorical position of one's own \"camp\" while eroding that of the US. There is no actual concern for the moral system against which the hypocrisy is being charged. The only normative value that the criticism of hypocrisy bears in this context is whatever normative value one assigns to the act of hypocrisy itself.

It has neither moral nor pragmatic substance.\n\n>White Man's Burden? They hardly make a secret of their imperative to civilize the savages. It's blatant racism by modern standards, sure, but that's hindsight speaking.\n\n\"White Man's Burden\" was coined by Rudyard Kipling in 1899. That whole paternalistic attitude was more a staple of the second half of the 19th century and beyond. Prior to that, I think attitudes were a lot more \"pragmatic\" in the sense that there were no pretensions that what was being done was for the benefit of those suffering under imperialism. As a parallel, US slavery apologia that portrayed slavery as being best for American black people wasn't really prominent until the rise of the Abolition movement in the mid 19th century; it was actually an (pathetic) attempt to respond to the moral attacks of the Abolitionists. There weren't really many pretensions about the self-serving nature of slavery prior to that. In a similar manner, the \"assimilation\" phase of Federal Indian Policy only began in the late 19th century. Between the Jackson administration and the late 19th century, the aims were to just remove Native Americans from areas of white American settlement and corral them into reservations.\n\nThat aside, the \"White Man's Burden\" attitude wasn't really a \"universal morality\" and it was not hypocritical. Those espousing were opposed to universalism and were decidedly consequentialist: the white people were the civilizers and the non-white people were to be civilized (but still inherently inferior). Different moral rules applied to each. I also don't think there were any pretensions that those being civilized would ever actually rise to the same level as the civilizers. The actions of the British Raj toward the Indian populace were not a deviation from the ideal, unlike unilateral, self-interested American actions in the context of a \"rules based order\". They *were* the ideal because that's what \"civilizing\" amounted to: it was a \"spare the rod, spoil the child\" mentality applied at scale to a people viewed as perpetual children in essence.\n\nDemented and immoral?

There weren&#39;t really many pretensions about the self-serving nature of slavery prior to that. In a similar manner, the &quot;assimilation&quot; phase of Federal Indian Policy only began in the late 19th century. Between the Jackson administration and the late 19th century, the aims were to just remove Native Americans from areas of white American settlement and corral them into reservations.</p>\n\n<p>That aside, the &quot;White Man&#39;s Burden&quot; attitude wasn&#39;t really a &quot;universal morality&quot; and it was not hypocritical. Those espousing were opposed to universalism and were decidedly consequentialist: the white people were the civilizers and the non-white people were to be civilized (but still inherently inferior). Different moral rules applied to each. I also don&#39;t think there were any pretensions that those being civilized would ever actually rise to the same level as the civilizers. The actions of the British Raj toward the Indian populace were not a deviation from the ideal, unlike unilateral, self-interested American actions in the context of a &quot;rules based order&quot;. They <em>were</em> the ideal because that&#39;s what &quot;civilizing&quot; amounted to: it was a &quot;spare the rod, spoil the child&quot; mentality applied at scale to a people viewed as perpetual children in essence.</p>\n\n<p>Demented and immoral? Yes. Hypocritical? Personally, I don&#39;t think so.</p>\n</div>",

I.e. an Iranian who criticizes US unilateral meddling in a \"rules based order\" while Iran unilaterally \"meddles\" throughout the Middle East. Iran isn't trying to champion a \"rules based order\" but the Iranian in question is still appealing to the *same* moral rule from said \"rules based order\" to criticize American actions.

To use a Biblical example, the Israelites were the \"good guys\" in the Old Testament because they were God's chosen; they upheld their covenant with God unlike the rest of the world. This is what I meant by \"pragmatic\", which is also why I put it in quotes. Imperial Europeans were \"good guys\" because they were civilized, not because they were \"moral\". Morality followed from being civilized and, in some ways, was only a function of the civilized. The \"uncivilized\" were both incapable of fully exercising morality and were also not subject to the same moral rules.\n\nAnd this is an **old** idea, probably rooted in a core social psychology of in/out grouping. Aristotle justified slavery on the basis of there being a natural order of civilized peoples and barbarians under them, with animals being under both. The Old Testament specifies different rules for Israelites compared to foreigners (and slaves from foreign countries), although Judaism still allowed for conversion of foreigners, at which point they were subject to the same protections (this largely carried over into Christianity).

This is clearly seen with the Jacksonian Federal Indian Policy of removal and containment in the reservation system. This wasn't really being done for the betterment of the indigenous Americans, except maybe the side-effect of getting them out of the way of the settlers who would otherwise kill them. The motivation was pretty straightforward: white settlers wanted to expand and indigenous Americans were in the way (and resisting/attacking them). It was only in the late 19th century that the assimilation stage emerged, after the indigenous tribes had already been contained. This was when the \"subjugating for your own good\" mentality was applied; cultural erasure and putting indigenous kids in boarding schools was done to \"civilize\" the indigenous peoples, for their own good.\n\nAgain, the same distinction exists with the institution of American slavery: early Americans were not purchasing and shipping Africans across the Atlantic for their own good.

It is the most recent opinion poll from Palestinians that I can find.

Among those intending to vote, Haniyeh would receive 76% and Abbas 20%\n\nSo, my subjective analysis of this data from the poll is that Israel's attack on the Gaza Strip galvanized the local population into supporting Hamas to the greatest extent they have ever seen. Abbas is now a totally defunct figure. You cannot say you support democracy but push to install an unpopular leader with less local support than RFK has in the US. \n\nIsrael not only did not destroy Hamas, they helped Hamas become the single most popular political party in both Palestine and the middle east at large.

I do not believe Israel can say they achieved the goal of ending support for Hamas or recruits joining Hamas. \n\nFast forward 6 months from now I could see Hamas back to firing more rockets into Israel than they did through most of the last decade. At a certain point what does Hamas even gain from a ceasefire? Thats just giving Israel an out to not have to deal with attacks from Gaza while they are active in Lebanon.

At a certain point what does Hamas even gain from a ceasefire? Thats just giving Israel an out to not have to deal with attacks from Gaza while they are active in Lebanon. If I&#39;m Iran or Hamas leadership in Qatar, I would posit a permanent ceasefire benefits Israel in the short to medium term more than Hamas.</p>\n</div>",

            "body": "I think, at some level, Hamas and friends are fighting the last war - the one where Israel unilaterally withdrew from Gaza and attempted various \"limited\" and \"proportional\" responses to rocket attacks in the decades since. Hamas are playing for time and expecting Israel to eventually get tired of this and back off. That strategy may indeed still pay off. \n\nBut radicalization works both ways, and Oct 7 was the worst single day for Israel in its history. That leaves a mark just as well as Gaza getting flattened. What if that mark leads Israel to committing to and maintaining real physical control over the borders?
