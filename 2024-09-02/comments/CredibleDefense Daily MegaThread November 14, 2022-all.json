            "body": "re: Putin, there's a much longer story about \"political technologists\" running both Putin's party and opposition parties like a theater event to maintain his power.  Just as groups on any side of the spectrum in the West gain Russian support, e.g. die Linke in Germany, National Front/Rally in France etc. within Russia, far right groups, the very strange communist party and dozens of other ideologies, think tanks and so on justifying or critiquing the government from most possible angles, to stifle dissent into certain directions.\n\nIn regards to the war, people in the West speak of racism/colonialism/Great Russian chauvinism, how ethnic Russians are colonizing other peoples and so on - but if you speak to the Panslavists or pro ethnic Russians/East Slavs or or or... half of their membership are imprisoned, they spoke of the government keeping the low scale conflict in Ukraine up to bleed out their best blablabla. But of course that worldview collapsed in February. Nevertheless, they are anti-Putin and have largely fled, now.\n\n----\n\nIn regards to Germany, oh yes, there were people far more extreme than Hitler. Just as Dugin isn't special in Russia, just a run of the mill guy regurgitating the Zeitgeist and the same popular philosophers, Hitler wasn't particularly unique either. As the German government fell to November revolution in the first WWI, the right found themselves wanting to do the same thing. Many coups were attempted - Hitler's own beer hall Putsch preempted the Bavarian triumvirate's own plans, because they wanted to sideline Hitler. Hundreds of groups, free militias and so on were active. As time went on, somehow Hitler's group managed to subsume them into itself, but they wanted far more.\n\nOn the 6th of July, 1933 Hitler declared the national socialist revolution complete. A year later, on the 5th of September, he said \"the national socialist revolution as a revolutionary approach is over ... There is no revolution as a continuing process, which doesn't lead to total anarchy.\" People were unhappy about this because they saw a \"conservative revolution\" as the post facto justification for the suffering of WWI. Platforms like the Nazis' 25 point program emerged in the 20s, envisioning a total transformation of society, removing the moneyed classes, replacing the standing elites with a new warrior caste (whence the SS' whole platform, their special schools and so on) which would somehow avoid emasculation while being productive office workers. They felt betrayed - the movement was just a delivery mechanism to get Hitler and his cronies in power, next to the old elites. (Relatedly, see Elite Theory a la Robert Michels)\n\nThis isn't to say that they wanted to kill more people or something. While many would argue Hitler's main shtick was antisemitism, there were other considerations (ultimately, they seem to have wanted Lebensraum to compete with the billions of other humans in a great war and avert the decline of Western civilization/Spengler's thoughts - and the war, many genocides etc. were means to that next mean.) Historiographically, the Holocaust functionalism vs. intentionality debate rages on. Many of these national conservative revolutionaries participated in Antijewish activities from the beginning, but many were themselves ethnically Jewish (even many like Theodor Duesterberg were antisemetic but then learned they were Jewish...) Many of them were Antislav, but in Hitler's original backers and close confidants were white emigrees Russian nobles who wanted to win back Russia. (See or Michael Kellogg's Russian Roots of Nazism or the Wirtschaftliche Aufbau-Vereinigung where Rosenberg started). Some of these were Baltic Germans like Scheubner-Richter, but many more were not, like Vasily Biskupsky financed Hitler in the 20s as well as the Kapp Putsch), Pyotr Shabelsky-Bork, Pyotr Kasnov ...  the Russian National People's Army or minor figures like Victor Tourjansky, Dmitry Merezhkovsky, Alexandre Volkoff... (Other weird guys like Anastasy Vonsiatsky...) That is to say, it was more complex than direct genocide and many actors saw things moving in different directions, liked most of what was happening but not all or such - and then tigers ate their faces. I mention these Russian coincidentally to the modern war, as examples of men who wanted a strong Russia - in direct opposition to the ideas of Lebensraum to paint a picture of the constantly evolving ideological mosaic at play. After the war, most would argue antisemitism played no important part in the movement blablabla although some continued in that direction, in many cases moving to Arab countries to continue writing antisemetic propaganda (Aribert Heim, Johann von Leers, Otto Remer, Alfred Zingler, Walter Rauff...) but this is verging far from the topic.\n\nStrasserism was sort of the SA position (romanticized by conservatives after the war to remove the taint of Hitler), the brand of Nazism which desired a 2nd revolution to make the workers own the factories etc. National Bolshevism is related.\n\nOthers critiqued such movements from the right, like Julius Evola (an Italian, who moved to Germany during the war and did research with the SS leading to the deaths of tends of thousands of Masons), who believed a leader enslaves himself to the people. Hitler and Mussolini were slaves to the shifting whims of the people, like a bull rider is to the bull.\n\nLarge strands of SS grew to want to internationalize the movement, to raise up the status of foreign volunteers after victory and include them in the \"new world order\" to oppose other people's as a united Europe instead of only as Germanic Europe. Others, including their leader, were fiercely against this.\n\nMost of these movements find modern support among splinter elements of the far right, with people on watch lists continuing their discussions until today.\n\nArmin Mohler, a Swiss fascist who tried to join the Nazis but quickly grew disillusioned and left, wrote a taxonomy of the national conservative movement to try to rehabilitate other strands of the petri dish Nazism emerged from. In his work, he brings up hundreds of thinkers, actors and so on who wanted something \"more\" in whatever direction they cared about.\n\nBack to modern Russia, you get people discussing Ivan Iljin, Dugin or even Carl Schmitt as Hitler's philosopher, claiming that Surkov or or or leads everything. But as with all human endeavors, as with the US intervention in Iraq, this is a complex emergent phenomena where every action is a consensus decision, arrived at by many actors with contradictory reasons, as nothing as ever been done for only one reason. All of these actors have different hopes and goals - and many of those positions include things they wish the government would do \"more\" of. Like mobilize all of society, utilize nuclear weapons, use chemical weapons - or become a theocracy or purge the government of non-Russians in order to collect together the Russian lands, or become a Tsardom. Or or or...\n\nRe-Fighting the Civil War - Beyda\n\nRussian Fascists: Tragedy and Farce in Exile - John Stephan\n\nHitler's \"Russian Connection: White Emigre Political and Ideological Influence on the Genesis and Development of National Socialism - Michael Kellogg\n\nDie Konservative Revolution in Deutschland - Armin Mohler\n\n\n------\n\nI want to mention The National Alliance of Russian Solidarists who were seemingly the only right wing Russian group to not subsume themselves into the Nazi movement (they were still fascists though.) Although they dispatched thousands of men into the German army, to work as translators, their goal was to build cells in order to throw off both the Nazis and the Soviets. By 1944 the Germans had figured it out and killed their cadres, while the SS was frantically arming whatever collaborators they could.\n\nSuch groups are very interesting in the context of e.g. Bandera, as many collaborated for many reasons - and we will soon see many in Ukraine who collaborated with the Russians (albeit on a far smaller scale).",

        "body": "Since I didn't see it mentioned, CIA Director Burns apparently met with the Director of the SVR Naryshkin today in Ankara. Apparently, Burns delivered a warning on the risks of nuclear escalation and threats to strategic stability. He also talked about prisoner swaps with Russia. Burns is probably THE person to talk face-to-face with Russia given his history. He was also the one sent to Moscow to try and warn Russia off of the invasion before it started. The US insists that he was not there to discuss any settlements and adds that they briefed Ukraine on the meeting to keep it all above board. Peskov admitted that the meeting happened but wouldn't give any details or say who was involved from Russia. It's possible there may have been a series of meetings between US and Russian intelligence officials outside just Burns and Naryshkin but I can't see a confirmation of that.  \n\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/world/russian-us-officials-holding-talks-turkey-kommersant-2022-11-14/](https://www.reuters.com/world/russian-us-officials-holding-talks-turkey-kommersant-2022-11-14/)  \n\n\nIt's an interesting development. At the risk of sounding conspiratorial, I think there was probably more to this than nuclear weapons threats and prisoner exchanges. Both of those are very good covers for a meeting to discuss a broad range of issues and I don't think you go out of your way to arrange a special meeting in Ankara just to deliver a warning (maybe you do, I really don't know, just seems a bit of a stretch). The Russians probably trust Burns more than any other US official, so he's the kind of person you would send to try and maybe gauge what Russia's plans are, if they have any thoughts of changing their more extreme stances on negotiation positions, etc. Russia's willingness to engage in this kind of a talk is also intriguing. Really shuts down their early October narrative of \"no communication lines exist\" and shows that Russia is willing to talk to the US in a normal manner despite all their bluster about the US being party to the war or whatever. Only thing I hope is that this is not indicative of the US seeing a more serious risk of nuclear threats and trying to take steps to head it off at the pass. Not entirely impossible after the October scare and now the fall of Kherson.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Since I didn&#39;t see it mentioned, CIA Director Burns apparently met with the Director of the SVR Naryshkin today in Ankara. Apparently, Burns delivered a warning on the risks of nuclear escalation and threats to strategic stability. He also talked about prisoner swaps with Russia. Burns is probably THE person to talk face-to-face with Russia given his history. He was also the one sent to Moscow to try and warn Russia off of the invasion before it started. The US insists that he was not there to discuss any settlements and adds that they briefed Ukraine on the meeting to keep it all above board. Peskov admitted that the meeting happened but wouldn&#39;t give any details or say who was involved from Russia. It&#39;s possible there may have been a series of meetings between US and Russian intelligence officials outside just Burns and Naryshkin but I can&#39;t see a confirmation of that.  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/russian-us-officials-holding-talks-turkey-kommersant-2022-11-14/\">https://www.reuters.com/world/russian-us-officials-holding-talks-turkey-kommersant-2022-11-14/</a>  </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s an interesting development. At the risk of sounding conspiratorial, I think there was probably more to this than nuclear weapons threats and prisoner exchanges.

Withdrawal of Russian troops and cessation of hostilities\n\nThis is really the only point that needs working out but is almost surely impossible to solve in the near future. \n\nRealistically, there's probably no middle ground regarding the occupied territories that could be acceptable to both parties. Ukraine won't probably accept loosing any territory (they might accept to no try to retake Crimea militarily as they've repeatedly talked about retaking it diplomatically). On the other hand, I don't think Putin can politically afford to deoccuppy everything but Crimea, even in Ukraine agreed to not block access to water supply for Crimea. \n\nA middle ground solution could be some sort of independent status for the Donbass, but I don't see Ukraine agreeing to that. \n\nOverall, I think the war will have to go on longer before a diplomatic solution is possible.",

Since independence there has been a great deal of internal debate about the degree of autonomy Crimea should have.  This would solve that thorny constitutional issue, and prevent Russia from having it.  Since solving the territorial dispute is critical for entering NATO it seems like this would be a compromise that significantly benefits Ukraine.\n\nFinally, who do you think is going to be invading Chechnya to set up an independent republic as a result of this \"example\"? I can't think of a regional power that would be that dumb.  So who exactly do you think this is going to be incentivizing?",

The MQ-1C has a payload of 400 lb while the TB-2 only has a payload of approximately 330 lb (150 kg). Note that both only have 4 hardpoints. This is reflected in the AGM-114 Hellfire being more heavier than their Turkish counterparts. I won\u2019t go too much into detail but the MQ-1C basically has a bigger punch possessing guided missiles with a larger warhead. \n\nIt should be noted though, what is more important here is range of the weaponry and the capability of the targeting system. In conjunction with better sensors, greater range allows for the drone to be farther away from air defenses. Although the number of neutralized TB-2s is nowhere near Russia\u2019s claims, Oryx has verified that 14 of the drones have been destroyed. Since neither of these drones have a countermeasures system that is readily available, the importance of the ability to launch farther away from danger increases greatly. However, that is less of a function of the aircraft as a whole and more of the sensor suite and the guided missile itself. However, I cannot pass judgement here.\n\nRange, endurance, and service ceilings are somewhat murky. For endurance, the TB-2 has 27 hours of flight time while the MQ-1C has somewhere between 25 hours and 27 hours depending on the source. The TB-2 has a service  ceiling of 25,000 ft while the MQ-1C has a service ceiling of between 25,000 ft and 29,000 ft depending on the source. As for range, the TB-2 has up to 4,000 km (2,200 nautical miles) while the MQ-1C has around 2,500 nautical miles. Generally, the MQ-1C has a similar endurance to the TB-2 but has greater range and a comparable or better service ceiling. Speed is another notable characteristic with the TB-2 being slower (120 knots) than the MQ-1C (150 to 169 knots depending on source). However, these speeds are maximum speed and frankly, most of the time the drone will be operating at cruising speed to conserve fuel.\n\nThe other point is their size. The TB-2 is much smaller than the MQ-1C and although I will have to do more research on the subject, I believe the TB-2 should have a shorter minimum runway length than the MQ-1C.",

Washington also regarded Ukrainian agreement to eliminate the nuclear weapons on its territory as critical for broader nonproliferation objectives, including the Clinton administration\u2019s goal of achieving an indefinite extension of the NPT at the 1995 review and extension conference.\n\n[link (page 4)](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/05_trilateral_process_pifer.pdf)\n\nThis doesn't even *begin* to talk about the broader issue of European alliance security under NATO when suddenly a new player emerges with an arsenal many times that of France and the UK...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>At the lowest end, Ukraine has deep knowledge of the system, and already knows of weaknesses that can be exploited without changing hardware.

At the time of the dissolution of the USSR, nuclear weapons were delivered *as is* to Ukraine - with Soviet scientists maintaining and operating them.

How is this in *any way credible?*\n\nAnd even if we do accept your premise that Ukraine can somehow modernize and maintain a small amount of nuclear weapons: does that even act as a credible deterrent to the seizure of Crimea? It didn't stop the Egyptians from attacking the Israeli held Sinai, the Kargil conflict, or the Argentinian attack on the Falklands.

The laser is said to be able to pierce five layers of 2-mm-thick steel plates at a distance of 800m, or 5-mm-thick steel plate from 1,000m away.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Also, something I&#39;ve never understood: which is the ratio between the input and output power of laser weapons systems? If 30KW is the output power, how much is the input power? I believe it depends, basically, on which technology you use and how much it is technologically advanced.</p>\n</div>",

If you go look at some google maps streetview images from various places in the peninsula, you will see that almost none of the terrain is like a disease ridden miasmic marsh, rather its more like a coastal resort area with plenty of buildings to camp out in. There are innumerable lakes, dense copses of trees, undriveable scrubland, and sand dunes which is why people say it is rugged. Beyond a single paved coastal road, there are a maze of twisting dirt roads, but either one would be trivial to disrupt with ambushes and they are bottlenecked as well by the width of the peninsula. Supposing Ukraine just wants to create a fixing force of less than 1000 soldiers, supplying the area from across the water would be much easier than by land even. A few boatloads of food and bullets snuck over by night in fast boats would be much easier than driving trucks 30 miles under Ukrainian artillery. The Russians do not likely have any remaining navy anywhere nearby, certainly not in the Dnipro Bay, so the risk to small boats is miniscule. You could run them right up to the frontlines. And so long as Ukraine doesn't expect to dig in with extremely static defenses, you really couldn't pick a better place for light infantry. All the dense forests are perfect places to hide from drones. If the Russians move to clear them out, they will face repeated ambushes, but when they pull back to shell, the Ukrainians will just shift to the next thicket.",

            "body": "Its important to take a step back here and think for a second about how to build river defenses on the grand tactical and operational scale for a second. Because this makes a lot more sense if we think about *How* Russia is probably building up its defenses on the east bank (also can we *please* use the cardinal directions and not left/right?) \n\nSo defending a river is something that Napoleon really perfected first in his Italian campaigns and then ultimately in his single Spanish campaign (that is, the one Spanish operation he commanded personally). The problem is that if you try to defend every crossing, eventually either you spread yourself out too thinly and the enemy overwhelms one crossing and breaks through, or you miss a crossing and get outflanked from an unexpected direction. For what *not* to do, see George Washington's defense of the Brandywine River which culminated in a battle in which his army was almost destroyed. The trick for Napoleon was using cavalry, infantry, and strong points to defend the river. He established a series of outpost and strongpoints along a river line with the fastest of his forces. When the enemy drug their guns up to a crossing and began to force it, the outpost would fall back report back. Napoleon would hold his main force in reserve and either wait for the enemy to cross, and then counter attack, or would use the opportunity of the enemy showing his hand to make a more operationally significant counter crossing. The idea then, and this is something even Clausewitz talks about, is to hold the river lightly, then concentrate and counterattack. \n\nThe ultimate modern expression of this is Herman Balck's defense of the Chir river in 1942. There he used very light screening forces along the river. They would detect the Soviets as they crossed the river. His infantry he had dug into static positions in towns and forests, and combined his (very limited) grenadiers with the divisions AT and Flak 88 assets to create a very strong armored defense. As soon as the location of the next attack was determined, Balck would then push his (again severely depleted) armor forward and catch the Soviets in the flank and rear. By repeating this, and using A) his interior lines, B) the high mobility of towed AT and tanks, and C) the intelligence advantage afford to the outpost defense system Balck was able to turn the Chir river into a lone brightspot in the otherwise dismal retreat from Stalingrad. \n\nWe know doctrinally that the Russians prefer an outpost and strongpoint defensive system. Very likely they are adopting something very similar to what we see above, where the river itself and the front line of towns and strongpoints are garrisoned by very light covering troops (and probably Mobiks at that). Behind them in the second line of strongpoints are the main resistance troops. If a serious crossing were made, reserve armored and mechanized forces would then counterattack and attempt to destroy the crossing or at least contain it. Additionally infantry is much more mobile than in Balck's time, once the primary crossing were discovered it would be easy to begin to shift other infantry in the area to build up a strong counter move. \n\nWeve seen in Kherson and elsewhere that Russians are still using this layout in their defenses. When the Kherson offensive started we read about Ukraine capturing a string of border points and towns, just to run into a wall when they hit real defenses. Likewise here I see reports of SOF entering towns that were either empty, or only very lightly defended. Likely theyre pushing screening forces out of towns. That is, were seeing a battle of strongpoints going on. But that doesn't mean were seeing a real collapse in the Russian position, or even the transition to a large scale crossing. SOF should be able to roll up a platoon or less of Mobiks, who anyway would have orders to skadoodle the first sign of trouble. These raids are good for Ukraine, make sense to do, but I would be surprised if they are translated into a more stable and permanent prescience (Kinburn excluded, Ive said in this thread before it seems to me to be a strong forward base for SOF.) I would expect the far side of the Dnipro to become a no-mans-land, but I personally think people shouldn't blow it too far out of proportion. At least until we see more.",

That&#39;s not even quibbling when they had the rail line going again days later and the span has already been repaired. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>And that rail line still is not functional</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You did literally zero research: </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/kerch-strait-bridge-road-and-rail-traffic-resume-to-very-limited-degree\">https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/kerch-strait-bridge-road-and-rail-traffic-resume-to-very-limited-degree</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Ukrainians don&#39;t need to bring over a couple of million men, nor to fight through well established coastal defenses </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The UAF needs brigades plural to do anything tactically significant from that region, which means supplying them. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>manned by competent and motivated troops. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yeah, static divisions with Osttruppen battalions.

Given the masses of social media coming out of kherson over the previous days i'm not sure what exactly this danger was?\n\n-----------------\n\nPress freedoms in warzeones is quite an interesting topic really. \n\nThey had pretty free reign in Vietnam - probably the peak of wartime journalistic freedom - and it was considered a disaster by those in charge, many of whom blamed the media for the war failing. After all when the media can take photos of all your atrocities it's not a good look.\n\nfrom the wiki, you can see that this had already changed significantly by the gulf war\n\n>> The role of war correspondents in the Gulf War would prove to be quite different from their role in Vietnam. The Pentagon blamed the media for the loss of the Vietnam war,[9] and prominent military leaders did not believe the United States could sustain a prolonged and heavily televised war.[10] As a result, numerous restrictions were placed on the activities of correspondents covering the war in the Gulf. Journalists allowed to accompany the troops were organized into \"pools\", where small groups were escorted into combat zones by US troops and allowed to share their findings later.[10] Those who attempted to strike out on their own and operate outside the pool system claim to have found themselves obstructed directly or indirectly by the military, with passport visas revoked and photographs and notes taken by force from journalists while US forces observed.\n\n>> Beyond military efforts to control the press, observers noted that press reaction to the Gulf War was markedly different from that of Vietnam. Critics claim that coverage of the war was \"jingoistic\" and overly favorable towards American forces, in harsh contrast to the criticism and muckraking that had characterized coverage of Vietnam.[11] Journalists like CNN's Peter Arnett were lambasted for reporting anything that could be construed as contrary to the war effort, and commentators observed that coverage of the war in general was \"saccharine\" and heavily biased towards the American account.[11]\n\n>> These trends would continue into the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, where the pool model was replaced by a new system of embedded journalism.\n\nThinking back to the Iraq war you can see this change quite clearly really. Obviously my memory won't be perfect, but my recollection is that largely reporting was fairly bland, largely parroted the 'official' talking points and had a significant bias towards the side with which the journalists were embedded (generally our side) in terms of what was reported and how. You'd have the occasional scandal like abu ghraib that poked through after the fact, but generally the whole thing was extremely sanitised and 'stage managed'.\n\nObviously it makes perfect sense for those in charge to do everything in their power to control what is reported, but i don't think it does the general population any favours. Had vietnam-style reporting been the norm since i think it's possible we would have seen a lot fewer wars and a lot less support for those that had occurred. That everything journalists see is what they are being 'allowed' to see kinda goes against the whole point of journalism no?

Given the masses of social media coming out of kherson over the previous days i&#39;m not sure what exactly this danger was?</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Press freedoms in warzeones is quite an interesting topic really. </p>\n\n<p>They had pretty free reign in Vietnam - probably the peak of wartime journalistic freedom - and it was considered a disaster by those in charge, many of whom blamed the media for the war failing. After all when the media can take photos of all your atrocities it&#39;s not a good look.</p>\n\n<p>from the wiki, you can see that this had already changed significantly by the gulf war</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The role of war correspondents in the Gulf War would prove to be quite different from their role in Vietnam. The Pentagon blamed the media for the loss of the Vietnam war,[9] and prominent military leaders did not believe the United States could sustain a prolonged and heavily televised war.[10] As a result, numerous restrictions were placed on the activities of correspondents covering the war in the Gulf. Journalists allowed to accompany the troops were organized into &quot;pools&quot;, where small groups were escorted into combat zones by US troops and allowed to share their findings later.[10] Those who attempted to strike out on their own and operate outside the pool system claim to have found themselves obstructed directly or indirectly by the military, with passport visas revoked and photographs and notes taken by force from journalists while US forces observed.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond military efforts to control the press, observers noted that press reaction to the Gulf War was markedly different from that of Vietnam. Critics claim that coverage of the war was &quot;jingoistic&quot; and overly favorable towards American forces, in harsh contrast to the criticism and muckraking that had characterized coverage of Vietnam.[11] Journalists like CNN&#39;s Peter Arnett were lambasted for reporting anything that could be construed as contrary to the war effort, and commentators observed that coverage of the war in general was &quot;saccharine&quot; and heavily biased towards the American account.[11]</p>\n\n<p>These trends would continue into the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, where the pool model was replaced by a new system of embedded journalism.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thinking back to the Iraq war you can see this change quite clearly really. Obviously my memory won&#39;t be perfect, but my recollection is that largely reporting was fairly bland, largely parroted the &#39;official&#39; talking points and had a significant bias towards the side with which the journalists were embedded (generally our side) in terms of what was reported and how. You&#39;d have the occasional scandal like abu ghraib that poked through after the fact, but generally the whole thing was extremely sanitised and &#39;stage managed&#39;.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously it makes perfect sense for those in charge to do everything in their power to control what is reported, but i don&#39;t think it does the general population any favours. Had vietnam-style reporting been the norm since i think it&#39;s possible we would have seen a lot fewer wars and a lot less support for those that had occurred. That everything journalists see is what they are being &#39;allowed&#39; to see kinda goes against the whole point of journalism no? They work best when they can get into places where others can&#39;t and see things when they are &#39;raw&#39; as it were.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve been trying to find a decent write-up/ information regarding general experiences of journalists across different conflicts (and sides of those conflicts) but haven&#39;t found anything good yet.</p>\n</div>",

Obviously my memory won't be perfect, but my recollection is that largely reporting was fairly bland, largely parroted the 'official' talking points and had a significant bias towards the side with which the journalists were embedded (generally our side) in terms of what was reported and how. You'd have the occasional scandal like abu ghraib that poked through after the fact, but generally the whole thing was extremely sanitised and 'stage managed'.\n\nCompletely opposite actually. \n\nThe embedded reporters mainly involved the invasion and after that few of the main stream media ever did it again. After that, most of the media in Iraq stayed in the Green Zone.\n\nThe press was not at all on board with the Bush Administration, it pushed negative news and especially casualties heavily (including major papers having monthly pictures and names of all the month's deaths), done to exert pressure. Besides Fox News, the press was extremely critical of the senior military, though that was quite understandable because it was very lackluster until 2006). They reported every supposed war crime as if it was fact, rarely reported on anything positive even when there was positivity to report (later in the war).\n\nThey fired up the Left so that the 2006 Congressional election turned into basically only about Iraq, which the Left won big time.
