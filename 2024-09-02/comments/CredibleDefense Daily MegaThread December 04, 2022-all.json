The heating system requires constant maintenance, which according to this article was already falling behind as of 2008. \n\nhttps://www.powerengineeringint.com/decentralized-energy/district-energy/district-heating-and/\n\n> Russia has the largest and oldest district heating system in the world. More than 100 years old and comprising almost 500 CHP stations, 200,000 km of district heating pipeline network and more than 65,000 boiler houses, Russia\u2019s municipal district heating systems are a legacy of the Soviet era on which most of the country\u2019s urban population has come to depend on during the long and cold winter season.\n\n> Although Russia\u2019s installed capacity of CHP stations is among the largest in the world, there is little reliable data on their efficiency of energy use. There is also a lack of any governmental definition of high efficiency CHP, unlike in other countries such as the UK and in the European Union (EU). Furthermore, low investment and inadequate maintenance in Russia during the 1990s has severely decreased the reliability of heat supply in many systems. Below-cost pricing has also contributed to under-investment and poor maintenance, with an estimated 60% of the Russian network in need of major repair or replacement.\n\n> More than half of the 200,000 km network of municipal heat distribution pipelines is estimated to have already passed its technical life expectancy. Some pipeline systems are 40-50 years old \u201d way beyond their 16-20 year technical life expectancy. About 25%-30% of the system is considered in critical condition. For this reason it is estimated that a minimum of 10%-12% of pipes need to be changed every year. Yet each year only about 1% of pipes are changed across the whole Russian network. Raising the investments needed to replace, repair and maintain this immense network is the key challenge facing Russia\u2019s district heating system.\n\n> Another major challenge facing the development of CHP in Russia is the lack of an overall strategy and outlook for the heating sector. A draft law on the heat sector was discussed in the Russian State Duma in 2002 but was not passed into law and has since been neglected. This is especially a problem given the restructuring and privatization of the electricity sector during this time \u201d which was completed in 2008 \u201d to which the heat sector is so closely linked.

                        "body": ">How would North American production be disrupted while Middle Eastern production would not?\n\nBoth could be disrupted, in that case it would be much better to control both. Note that disrupted is not the same as completely 100% eliminated. If both are disrupted the upside of controlling both is higher as the strategical resource becomes even more scarce. \n\n>Are you imagining a situation in which the US unilaterally shifts global trade to reroute oil tankers straight into a conflict zone?\n\nHow do you believe logistics works? In total war the US would use whatever means needed, including civilians tankers. In normal war, the US would just use it's military oilers. A much shorter path to travel between the ME and SCS than US refineries to the same.\n\n>China has and will continue to expand its economic reach into the Middle East. US military presence has done virtually nothing to prevent this for the past two decades\n\nThat's completely false. The Chinese reach into the US aligned gulf was minimal before the US began withdrawing from the ME, and leaving their ME allies about a decade ago.\n\n>How will continual US Middle Eastern presence outside of the Strait of Hormuz further benefit US ability to interdict pipelines during war when they could be destroyed without major US regional presence?\n\nPipelines are pretty easy to fix. Furthermore, oil transportation is easy to distribute if needed. The ME has plenty of oil sources, refineries and pipelines, the system is distributed enough that it's virtually impossible to eliminate. Especially in the face of US active defense thereof. \n\nIn the case of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, would Iran really be willing to step into the war by attacking US logistics in the ME? That's not some minor harrowing action and attacks against allies, but direct attacks at a time of war. China has no meaningful means to interdict pipelines in the ME otherwise.\n\n>Again, this is already fast becoming a reality regardless of US military presence.\r  \n\r\n\nNo, this is fast becoming a reality ever since the US abandoned it's allies in the ME (withdrawing air defense from KSA and UAE while they are bombed by Iran), turned against their allies (sanctions against Sisi, siding with the Muslim brotherhood in Egypt), Abandoning the AANES in the face of a Turkish invasion and so on. US is increasingly unreliable ally in the ME, practically forcing the countries into the embraces of Russia and China.

Nor did the US react to the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/10/us/politics/iranian-john-bolton-assassination-charges.html\">assassination plot to assassinate a top US official by Iran</a>. Not to mention <strong>much much MUCH</strong> more significant transgressions such as Iranian attacks on US soldiers and civilians in Iraq. The entire affair has been overblown compared to prior and later similar or worse incidents.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>However the US State departments recent re-iteration of MBS&#39; sovereign immunity over the issue shows us that the the door is still open.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Oh, after pulling military support while the KSA was under missile and drone attacks, attacking KSA international standing by overblowing the Kashoggi affair and ignoring KSA legitimate security concerns in Yemen even after KSA caved to (legitimate) US demands to lift the blockade in 2018, which allowed massive Iranian supply of ballistic missiles and drones into the country... the US said some words? Oh well guess the alliance is as strong as ever.</p>\n\n<p>US intentionally chose to abandon KSA, in a clear break of the carter doctrine. making a strategical mistake. It was 100% a conscious choice and the consequences are exactly as has been foreseen in the related article I&#39;ve quoted in another comment. KSA seeking security guarantees from China is the clear result of US actions.</p>\n</div>",

It seems like a reasonable upper bound as to what the resolution might get.\n\nThat might still be able to pass (maybe with, say, 70 votes in favor and a crapton of abstentions), but it would obviously be due to western-aligned Europe having disproportionate representation (over a quarter of the seats, but less than 10% of the top), which is compounded by most of the tiny Pacific islands voting the same way. I'm not going to say it's gerrymandering per se, because the multiplication of small states and city states within Europe is obviously not the product of a clever ploy to gain extra UN influence, but it does give the West undue weight and harms the legitimacy of decisions that are very one-sided but pass any way due to the West's overrepresentation.\n\nIt's hard to see how an \"international\" tribunal could be considered legitimate when its existence was only endorsed by governments representing only ~15% of the world's population (it'd be the \"International community\" meme all over again).
