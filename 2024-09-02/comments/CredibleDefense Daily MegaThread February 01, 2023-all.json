The oppression and slaughter imposed by communist regimes was horrific, as-is their continued oppression today.

Personally I try to see the civil war for what it is right now rather than what it was which is why I support de jure and de facto Taiwanese independence myself, but we shouldn't let current narratives dominate over facts merely because said facts are perceived to be inconvenient when they really aren't once you consider the whole picture, from which you can then form a more nuanced view of the situation, thus allowing reality to coexist with one's sense of righteousness without having to resort cherry picking facts and ignoring history which is the just the easy way out from this dilemma.",

Personally I try to see the civil war for what it is right now rather than what it was which is why I support de jure and de facto Taiwanese independence myself, but we shouldn&#39;t let current narratives dominate over facts merely because said facts are perceived to be inconvenient when they really aren&#39;t once you consider the whole picture, from which you can then form a more nuanced view of the situation, thus allowing reality to coexist with one&#39;s sense of righteousness without having to resort cherry picking facts and ignoring history which is the just the easy way out from this dilemma.</p>\n</div>",

Instead of the 9 dash line, they could put forward something more in line with international laws, assemble a conference of all South China Sea claimants, and then be one of the prime mediators when it comes to organizing a multilateral treaty that puts those claims to rest. If it weren't for the 9 dash line, China would have relatively few EEZ conflicts and could position itself as an impartial arbiter for all the other countries that have overlapping claims. This would establish China as a more benevolent power broker in the region instead of a bully. It would also help draw countries like Vietnam and the Philippines into China's sphere by showing them modest favor in disputes. China could even propose a joint organization between all South China Sea claimants to administer/patrol what has become the artificial islands. This reduces the military provocations that could arise in the region, establish a multilateral military collaborative framework, and shift attitudes more favorably towards China and away from US involvement.\n\nSomething similar could be worked with Japan. Resolve the dispute with regards to the Senkaku/Diaoyudao islands and a compromise on the East China Sea EEZ and that would go a long way towards reducing tensions with Japan. It would even preclude the Japanese changing their constitution so they can pursue a militarization policy. It would also reduce the need for American power projection since the area would be less militarized. China would effectively gain the moral high ground which is great for soft power utilization. This could even turn the Japanese public in favor of China and against the US for being a provocateur. \n\nWith regards to South Korea, the Chinese government could have essentially flipped their preference away from North Korea and to the south and put pressure on the Kim regime to tone down its rhetoric and nuclear development. An even larger diplomatic win would be brokering an integration deal between the two Koreas. They could even force the DPRK into accepting the deal on the condition that the ROK remove US forces from the peninsula. Add in trade insentives for the Korean peninsula and they could easily shun the US as a trade and political partner.\n\nThe Chinese government would basically have to have been kinda chill instead of what it is and nice to its neighbors instead of having a collective stick shoved up its governments ass. I'm willing to bet that if the Chinese government acknowledged Taiwan's independence, signed a treaty stating as much, and offered favorable trade terms, in time, they could break American backing for Taiwan and pull them almost totally into China's sphere of influence. America could probably have worked the same with Cuba by not maintaining a trade embargo for the last 60+ years and Central/South America by not overthrowing popular regimes and replacing them with puppet governments. Alas, none of that happened.\n\nThe problem with all this is that China takes a maximalist approach to EVERYTHING. It does not matter what dispute (9 dash line, Taiwan, Senkaku Islands, Aksai-Chin, public diplomatic comments, third party trade deals), it's China's way or the highway, and this is having an adverse effect on their regional standing, which in turn, pushes more regional nations to prefer western intervention and the US. China perceives this as a slight, they go for a maximalist reaction and, the feedback loop continues. It's like how authoritarian regimes crackdown hard on protests which sparks even more protests which sparks further crackdowns.",

Fundamentally this is an economic war from the US to try and crush China's economic development (the same way it did with Japan in the 1980s) in order to protect US dominance. All that diplomacy changes is minor differences in broader societal support for the actions taken. \n\nBiden uses more diplomatic language than trump did, but his actual policies take what trump did and expand on it massively.

But had Russia not invaded Ukraine in 2022 and instead, say, launched a lightning campaign against Estonia in 2030, are we really certain NATO would've come to their defense at the risk of WWIII/nuclear Armageddon? Im not so sure many NATO allies would've gone to the mat for the Baltic states, especially if there had been another decade of NATO disintegration and lack of focus/raison detre, and another decade of increasing energy reliance on Russia. This goes doubly so if the Russian invasion of Estonia was essentially a fait accompli that took the whole country in a matter of days. \n\nJust because Russia couldn't go toe to toe with the whole of NATO in a conventional war doesn't mean they aren't a clear and present danger to European peace and stability.

Domestic US rhetoric about 'scary trade deficit' (which isn't actually an inherently bad thing, but the position is endorsed by the arguments you linked), how japan was going to overtake the US economy and constant attacks on japan for 'mass IP theft' and 'unfair trade practices'. Exactly the same thing that has happened now. The US started a trade war to protect itself.\n\nThe option was either japan cripples its competitiveness or the US engages in massive protectionist policies. Japan conceded. Trump tried to get china to concede, but biden didn't give them the option and went straight for extreme protectionist measures under the increasingly absurd justification of 'national security'.\n\nTo be clear, a trade deficit is (in my view) in America's interest. It helps to flood the world with dollars and maintain their economic dominance. Fundamentally however the trade war and plaza accords were driven by domestic US political demands, not by any international norms. \n\nIf you're talking about the crippling their economy point? I used the word 'arguably' for a reason... it's up for debate. However massively increasing the value of your currency as a country reliant on exports cannot not massively reduce your economic competitiveness.",

Somehow I doubt it.\n\nThe US is also happily friends and allies with the member nations of the EU, even before the EU.  It's not some magical coincidence that the more liberal (in the classical sense of the word) a nation is, the easier of a relationship the US has.  You can claim that it is all a coincidence and that the modern day US really would go nuts on a liberal democratic rival even more unified than the EU, but all of the data points otherwise.  The more liberal your nation, the easier your relations with the US.  China, as an autocratic cult of personality dictatorship has a hard time maintaining good relations with the US, and the further they descend into an expansionistic autocratic cult of personality dictatorship, the harder it will be for the two nations to maintain good relations.\n\n>Obama's Pivot to Asia occurred before Xi took the reins, and early on it was thought that Xi would represent a continuation of the consensus rule followed under Hu.\n\nObama's \"Pivot to Asia\" was a new economic and diplomatic focus on East Asia.  The rise of China was certainly a large part of that, but the pivot was really reflecting the growing importance of South and Southeast Asia in general.  The center piece of it was the TPP, which was an economic measure that's primary goal was to get China to conform to   international economic standards.  That's light economic sparring with an eye towards a future where cooperation nets both nations greater fortunes. \n\nThat ship has sailed.  The US isn't trying to get China to follow international standards for trade anymore. As China became more of an expansionistic autocratic cult of personality dictatorship, the relationship soured until the relationships is now one of containment and disengagement.  Again, there is a direct line between China being more of expansionistic autocratic cult of personality dictatorship, and the US treating China like a problem to be contained rather than fellow nation to make peaceful trade with where both sides benefit.\n\n>Really?\n\nYes, really.  What you cite is not an example of the US \"sanctioning Japan\".  What you cite is in fact two nations peacefully struggling to negotiate a bilateral trade deal that enriches both sides.  \"Trade wars\" are in fact not wars.  It's nations peacefully struggling to come up with trade deals that bring more benefit than harm to their own domestic markets.  \n\nWhat the US is doing to China is very different.  The US sanctioned China to keep from from getting next generation chips and forbid US nationals from helping them.  This isn't a disagreement over trade.  That is in fact US calling China an expansionistic rival that they think has plans for a military conflict, and not wanting to help them with America's own technology.\n\n>I wonder why American opinion of Japan was so negative back in the late 80s and early 90s? Why did it suddenly improve after Japan's economic bubble burst? Such mysteries that will never be solved.\n\nIt's no mystery.  American opinion of Japan sunk when Americans felt like they were losing jobs to Japan.  That's a pretty normal reaction when people think that their is a trade imbalance between two peacefully trading nations, which there very much was due the US propping up Japan economically after World War II.  I'm not sure what your point is, other than that American's, like all people, don't like losing jobs to foreign competition.  Peaceful democratic nations resolve domestic unhappiness like this by peacefully negotiating trade deals, like what the US did with Japan.\n\n>That's because the EU isn't a unified entity and Japan has ceased to be a real economic rival.\n\nAgain, you can argue that a hypothetical liberal democracy would have a bad relationship with the US because the US can't stand a rival, but all of reality seems to disagree.  The EU, for all of it's faults, is very much it's own economic creature completely outside of the control of the US.  The US *hates* the EU's privacy laws and how the EU has restricted big US tech.  And despite a little economic friction between the two, the US does nothing but encourage and support the EU to the hilt, including encouraging them expand and unify militarily.  Instead of trying to discourage EU unity, the US does nothing but encourage it.\n\nThe US doesn't see fellow liberal democratic nations as rivals. It sees them opportunities.  It sees them as places to peaceful trade, and as military powers that can help the US confront expansionistic autocratic dictatorships.  The US doesn't believe in zero sum diplomacy, especially with liberal democratic allies, and that's only become more true with time.  This doesn't mean that the US runs a benevolent foreign policy, but being a fellow liberal democratic nations is pretty much a surefire way to get the US to view you as a opportunity rather than a threat.",

That is in fact US calling China an expansionistic rival that they think has plans for a military conflict, and not wanting to help them with America&#39;s own technology.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I wonder why American opinion of Japan was so negative back in the late 80s and early 90s? Why did it suddenly improve after Japan&#39;s economic bubble burst? Such mysteries that will never be solved.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It&#39;s no mystery.  American opinion of Japan sunk when Americans felt like they were losing jobs to Japan.  That&#39;s a pretty normal reaction when people think that their is a trade imbalance between two peacefully trading nations, which there very much was due the US propping up Japan economically after World War II.  I&#39;m not sure what your point is, other than that American&#39;s, like all people, don&#39;t like losing jobs to foreign competition.  Peaceful democratic nations resolve domestic unhappiness like this by peacefully negotiating trade deals, like what the US did with Japan.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>That&#39;s because the EU isn&#39;t a unified entity and Japan has ceased to be a real economic rival.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Again, you can argue that a hypothetical liberal democracy would have a bad relationship with the US because the US can&#39;t stand a rival, but all of reality seems to disagree.  The EU, for all of it&#39;s faults, is very much it&#39;s own economic creature completely outside of the control of the US.  The US <em>hates</em> the EU&#39;s privacy laws and how the EU has restricted big US tech.  And despite a little economic friction between the two, the US does nothing but encourage and support the EU to the hilt, including encouraging them expand and unify militarily.  Instead of trying to discourage EU unity, the US does nothing but encourage it.</p>\n\n<p>The US doesn&#39;t see fellow liberal democratic nations as rivals. It sees them opportunities.  It sees them as places to peaceful trade, and as military powers that can help the US confront expansionistic autocratic dictatorships.  The US doesn&#39;t believe in zero sum diplomacy, especially with liberal democratic allies, and that&#39;s only become more true with time.  This doesn&#39;t mean that the US runs a benevolent foreign policy, but being a fellow liberal democratic nations is pretty much a surefire way to get the US to view you as a opportunity rather than a threat.</p>\n</div>",

This is not a belief that the US has, nor is it reality.  A nation economically rising does not mean that your nation must decline.  A nation economically rising means that you have a trading partner, and two nations can trade with each other an feel like both have benefited.  You cannot deny this reality.  The EU and Japan are not signing trade deals because they are afraid of American invasion. They sign trade deals because they think they will benefit from the trade deal.\n\nIn the 1980s, domestic discontent over trade with Japan grew not because Japan was becoming more economically powerful, but because they two nations had *extremely* unbalanced trade due to the US propping up Japan after World War II.  The problem was resolved through peacefully negotiating new trade deals.  At no point was even the hint of force involved.  Both nations continue to peacefully trade with each other because both nations feel like they getting something out of it.\n\nIt's okay for the people of a democracy to be discontent with a trade deal and demand change if they feel it is no longer mutually beneficial.  This is a different thing from a nation considering another nation a military rival, and imposing sanctions.  The US is not afraid of the economic might of Russia or China.  The US considers them military rivals because they are in fact both expansionistic, authoritarian, cult of personality dictatorships.\n\n>Japan literally did not have an option to resist the US. The US military was literally in Japan, and yet relations still tanked. Why?\n\nYes, Japan did in fact have an option to \"resist\".  They could have just not signed a new trade deal.  At no point did the US threaten the invasion of Japan to get them to sign any trade deals.  Japan was not afraid of American invasion.  Japan signed the trade deals it signed with the US because Japan thought that they would economically benefit.  Two nations peacefully signing trade deals that they find to be mutually beneficial is in fact an example of peaceful relations.\n\n>The simple reality is that there's been no liberal democracy in modern history that's truly economically rivaled the US, and the one time there was one that's gotten close, relations and public opinion tanked, and the US launched a trade war as a result. You can call it \"peaceful negotiation\" or whatever you'd like, but it was a trade war, plain and simple.\n\nYeah, I do in fact call a \"trade war\" to be peaceful negotiations.  Every \"trade war\" that America has had with another nation ends in that nation signing a trade deal that both sides walk away from feel like it is enriched their nation.  A nation renegotiating a trade deal because they no longer think it is domestically beneficial is a peaceful and legitimate act.  \"Trade wars\" the likes which the  EU, Japan, and the US have engaged in are in fact peaceful relationships that end in mutual benefit.\n\nThe US change of attitude towards China is not an attempt to peacefully renegotiate a trade deal.  The US is doing that to some extent, but it is also intentionally trying to prevent the transfer of technology from the US to China (and Russia) because the US sees them as aggressive and expansionistic autocratic cult of personality dictatorships.  \n\n>Less related, the US worked with the Soviets against the French and British during the Suez crisis. Why is that? Don't liberal democracies cooperate?\n\nI don't think this helps your argument.  Why do you think the US worked against the French and British during the Suez crisis?  It certainly wasn't for economic gain or to help in it's fight with it's rival the USSR, as you correctly point out.  \n\nI think the US worked against them because post World War II US loathes colonization and was pretty happy to work against that very unpeaceful and unliberal institution; and it loathed it enough to find itself on the same side as the USSR for a hot second.

            "body": "I'm a former Marine who has been following these reforms and not liking them. But just for the record, a lot of these have little to nothing really to do with China:  \n\n\\- Tanks: The USMC is and always has been run by former infantry officers turned generals, who dominate the top ranks and especially Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC) and Assistant CMC. Due to the nature of the system, many of them don't know much about tanks, don't think they need them, don't appreciate or respect mechanized maneuver warfare, and especially hate the M1A1 Abrams. \n\nAs far back as General Krulak, the CMC back in the late 90s, he was saying if he could he'd get rid of USMC tanks then. And that's an opinion shared by many other of the top brass too. \n\nThey especially hate being considered \"The Second Army,\" mainly because they don't actually plan to act in that role (though operationally that is what they do most in the wars they end up fighting). But the big reason they hate that is due to the implications to their service's future: why does the USMC need to exist if it only replicates what the Army does? \n\nLastly, they already had major issues logistically supporting the M1A1s, plus transportation issues relating to amphibious ops (1x tank = 1x LCAC). But the US Army was about to force them to adopt the more complex M1A2 by stating it would no longer support USMC tank training, logistics, maintenance of their older fleet; ie, the USMC had to acquire the heavier and harder to maintain M1A2s. Or not have tanks. They finally got the excuse they've been waiting for at least since the late 90s, or always (the USMC has never been entirely comfortable at any time having tanks, other than during WW2). And at the time the Army hadn't decided on a new ~~light tank~~ Mobile Protected Firepower vehicle, so the USMC was safe from that trap. And with that, the USMC brass are free from that hassle, though like the numerous times in the past they've cut or downgraded armor, this will almost certainly come back to haunt them (they seriously stated they can make up for protected firepower with LAV-25 and the new Amphib Combat Vehicle, which are just APCs)\n\n\\- Artillery: They aren't cutting active duty M777 cannon arty batteries from 21x to 5-7x batteries (it was the former originally before getting hammered with criticism, now its supposedly 7x) because they realized tube artillery is a dead end. Its because they really love the idea of 70 km range GMLRS that the HIMARS can bring them. This one actually does heavily favor the South China Sea mission, as they also are waiting impatiently for the future development of the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM), which the HIMARS can fire that extends range to 500 km. Additionally, there is supposed to be an anti-ship seeker version of the PrSM too, which means the USMC Wake Island 2030   \n\n\n\\- The Numbers Game: Based on new technology and capabilities the USMC Reformers are seeking, namely more drones, electronic warfare, more HIMARS, they want to take the lead globally as the most advanced and revolutionary fighting force fully embracing net centric PGM, A2AD, and every other Pentagon buzzword you can think of. \n\nBut while their budget has gone up by 75% since pitching the \"We can handle the South China Sea PLA Navy expansion threat,\" its not gone up enough to fund everything. \n\nMuch more important, they can't increase the size of the Marine Corps strength in terms of officers, SNCOs, NCOs, and junior enlisted because only Congress can do that, and to get that done involves major hassles. But as a service, and with permission from SECNAV and Joint Chiefs (which they get because they can now do China threat), they are allowed to heavily modify their existing force structure to free up positions so they can gain what they don't have but want. \n\nFor example, getting rid of tank battalion also frees up their maintenance and bridging companies. Scrapping some infantry battalions opens up thousands of new slots for what they want to fill. \n\n\\- Aircraft: You'd think promoting a Wake Island 2030 strategy with insertion and resupply supported heavily by medium and heavy lift helicopters would mean they wouldn't be getting rid of them. So why are they? Thanks to Sequestration funding, spare parts and replacing old airframes is uncertain at best, which means almost no USMC rotary wing squadrons have been remotely close to 100% readiness for quite some time. \n\nSo instead of keeping up a facade that a squadron is really a squadron, which screws up planning and operational readiness for units who need an intact squadron to support them which isn't, they are getting rid of some squadrons so the remaining are full strength. \n\nAnd guess what happens with all the freed up personnel when they disband the extra squadrons? \n\n\\- Adopt or get out: Let's say you're a tanker, helicopter mechanic, or anything else being cut. You can lateral move to a new MOS, assuming you're not E6 or O4 or above, which is a career ender. Or for certain things, like tanks, they offered the ability to transfer to the Army (assuming the Army would take them). Or they can resign and take a severance. Or they can retire. \n\nSimilarly, let's say you're in the Marines and you just don't agree with the revolutionary approach, especially since none of this was actually tested before they implemented it, and then minimal testing was done to validate it. Well, if you don't like it, leave. \n\nThat's why its all retired officers voicing concerns, because everyone in the Marines of a rank where their opinion matters is too afraid to talk about it. So they're basically emailing the retired guys, filling them in, and the retired guys are going to bat.",

Due to the nature of the system, many of them don&#39;t know much about tanks, don&#39;t think they need them, don&#39;t appreciate or respect mechanized maneuver warfare, and especially hate the M1A1 Abrams. </p>\n\n<p>As far back as General Krulak, the CMC back in the late 90s, he was saying if he could he&#39;d get rid of USMC tanks then. And that&#39;s an opinion shared by many other of the top brass too. </p>\n\n<p>They especially hate being considered &quot;The Second Army,&quot; mainly because they don&#39;t actually plan to act in that role (though operationally that is what they do most in the wars they end up fighting). But the big reason they hate that is due to the implications to their service&#39;s future: why does the USMC need to exist if it only replicates what the Army does? </p>\n\n<p>Lastly, they already had major issues logistically supporting the M1A1s, plus transportation issues relating to amphibious ops (1x tank = 1x LCAC). But the US Army was about to force them to adopt the more complex M1A2 by stating it would no longer support USMC tank training, logistics, maintenance of their older fleet; ie, the USMC had to acquire the heavier and harder to maintain M1A2s. Or not have tanks. They finally got the excuse they&#39;ve been waiting for at least since the late 90s, or always (the USMC has never been entirely comfortable at any time having tanks, other than during WW2). And at the time the Army hadn&#39;t decided on a new <del>light tank</del> Mobile Protected Firepower vehicle, so the USMC was safe from that trap. And with that, the USMC brass are free from that hassle, though like the numerous times in the past they&#39;ve cut or downgraded armor, this will almost certainly come back to haunt them (they seriously stated they can make up for protected firepower with LAV-25 and the new Amphib Combat Vehicle, which are just APCs)</p>\n\n<p>- Artillery: They aren&#39;t cutting active duty M777 cannon arty batteries from 21x to 5-7x batteries (it was the former originally before getting hammered with criticism, now its supposedly 7x) because they realized tube artillery is a dead end. Its because they really love the idea of 70 km range GMLRS that the HIMARS can bring them. This one actually does heavily favor the South China Sea mission, as they also are waiting impatiently for the future development of the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM), which the HIMARS can fire that extends range to 500 km. Additionally, there is supposed to be an anti-ship seeker version of the PrSM too, which means the USMC Wake Island 2030   </p>\n\n<p>- The Numbers Game: Based on new technology and capabilities the USMC Reformers are seeking, namely more drones, electronic warfare, more HIMARS, they want to take the lead globally as the most advanced and revolutionary fighting force fully embracing net centric PGM, A2AD, and every other Pentagon buzzword you can think of. </p>\n\n<p>But while their budget has gone up by 75% since pitching the &quot;We can handle the South China Sea PLA Navy expansion threat,&quot; its not gone up enough to fund everything. </p>\n\n<p>Much more important, they can&#39;t increase the size of the Marine Corps strength in terms of officers, SNCOs, NCOs, and junior enlisted because only Congress can do that, and to get that done involves major hassles. But as a service, and with permission from SECNAV and Joint Chiefs (which they get because they can now do China threat), they are allowed to heavily modify their existing force structure to free up positions so they can gain what they don&#39;t have but want. </p>\n\n<p>For example, getting rid of tank battalion also frees up their maintenance and bridging companies. Scrapping some infantry battalions opens up thousands of new slots for what they want to fill. </p>\n\n<p>- Aircraft: You&#39;d think promoting a Wake Island 2030 strategy with insertion and resupply supported heavily by medium and heavy lift helicopters would mean they wouldn&#39;t be getting rid of them. So why are they? Thanks to Sequestration funding, spare parts and replacing old airframes is uncertain at best, which means almost no USMC rotary wing squadrons have been remotely close to 100% readiness for quite some time. </p>\n\n<p>So instead of keeping up a facade that a squadron is really a squadron, which screws up planning and operational readiness for units who need an intact squadron to support them which isn&#39;t, they are getting rid of some squadrons so the remaining are full strength. </p>\n\n<p>And guess what happens with all the freed up personnel when they disband the extra squadrons? </p>\n\n<p>- Adopt or get out: Let&#39;s say you&#39;re a tanker, helicopter mechanic, or anything else being cut. You can lateral move to a new MOS, assuming you&#39;re not E6 or O4 or above, which is a career ender. Or for certain things, like tanks, they offered the ability to transfer to the Army (assuming the Army would take them). Or they can resign and take a severance. Or they can retire. </p>\n\n<p>Similarly, let&#39;s say you&#39;re in the Marines and you just don&#39;t agree with the revolutionary approach, especially since none of this was actually tested before they implemented it, and then minimal testing was done to validate it. Well, if you don&#39;t like it, leave. </p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s why its all retired officers voicing concerns, because everyone in the Marines of a rank where their opinion matters is too afraid to talk about it. So they&#39;re basically emailing the retired guys, filling them in, and the retired guys are going to bat.</p>\n</div>",

The biggest resupply hurdle is always artillery ammo, so those wont be able to offroad much, but that's still okay as long as the infantry don't venture too far from the roads. \n\nHmm, I just realized that with so much more dismounted infantry, the Russians can actually have more success moving through restricted terrain like the Prypet Marsh. The limited roads through those areas can be easily blocked to stop vehicles but if the Russian infantry break brush while handrailing the highways, any time their forward advance of AFV run into a Ukrainian blocking position they can send out large numbers of their infantry to outflank the UAF position. The only way to counter that threat it is every Ukrainian blocking position has to form into an actual line extending rather far outwards into the swamps and forests, in strength, and dug in hard enough to stop infantry attacks. If the Russian infantry can push out that far or keep moving outwards to get around them, they can outflank the UAF infantry and then that outflanks the whole blocking position, causing the UAF to retreat. Then the Russians pick up and move until they reach the next blocking position and it restarts. But with more infantry, it'll be faster to get through those. \n\nGoddamn, I so want Ukraine to have DPICM and other cluster munitions. Just to finally watch it in action. Also, I'd make it a condition on artillery ammunition donations that if they don't use airburst/VT fuze against 90% of dismounted infantry threats we're cutting aid. Its nearly criminal how little they're using that fuze type, which is designed to utterly shred dismounted infantry attacks. \n\nFun fact, if they have proper overhead cover, a defender can call in a VT fire mission on their own position while they're being overrun by dismounts and remain largely unscathed. I was infatuated with airburst before this war, just from Afghanistan I figured it was the answer to most tactical problems. Having followed this war, that theory was confirmed.

During the same time, we saw the successful end of the massive Ukrainian offensive, which retook a lot of territory around Kharkiv. Combined with moving reserves and Wagner around, this allowed Russia to stabilize their lines and more or less freeze the conflict.\n\nOn December 7th, Putin reported that half of the mobilized men had been deployed to Ukraine. This slow rollout was expected; moving men and material to the front takes time, especially if these are new recruits needing training. Now that it is February, it is highly likely the vast majority of the remainder are in the Ukrainian AO and thus ready for offensive ops.\n\nSo I would expect the offensive to begin shortly--and they will likely be deployed to better Russia's tactical position. The key targets will likely be the following:\n\n* Zaporizhia. If Russia plans to crawl up the Dnieper to take Dnipro, this town will be a key juncture. It will also give them operational depth to better defend against Ukraine's own planned offensive in the region.\n\n* Bakhmut. This is more a cleanup job than an actual offensive. All signs indicate that Ukraine will pull out in the coming week(s). But should they hold on, Russia will need this town taken ASAP to move closer to Kramatorsk, the next major junction in the Donbass region.\n\n* Sivers'k. Russia had to abandon the town during the summer and fall offensives. Taking it will be the first step in retaking Lyman, which is essentially Slovyansk's gateway on that flank. Slovyansk and Kramatorsk are both fortress cities essential in the Ukrainian defense strategy in the Donbass.\n\nRussia also doesn't have a lot of time remaining in the campaigning season. By April/May, the ground should turn to mud once more and prevent any further offensives until later in summer. So now all eyes turn to the sectors named above, and we all await with bated breath the likely assault.",

He has been fighting the Russians since they first invaded, in 2014. His car has a dish for Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink satellite-internet service, now ubiquitous along the front lines, attached to its roof.

But most Ukrainian soldiers at the eastern front seem curiously unfazed. Colonel Maestro\u2019s point is that the reinforcements will not be highly trained professionals. Far from it. They are mobilised men, and many are convicts who have joined the mercenary Wagner group deployed in Bakhmut, because to do so is a way to get out of jail.

Meanwhile Brigadier-General Sergiy Melnyk, who oversees a large part of the Kharkiv region, including its border with Russia, says drones and satellite imagery have not indicated any new build-up of troops there. In fact, he says, the Russians are digging trenches and building defensive positions as if it is they who are expecting an attack.\n\n>Ukrainian commanders say that they believe the main Russian aim in trying to take Bakhmut is to present a success to the public at home, particularly for the Wagner group. \u201cIt is in a valley,\u201d says General Melnyk, so it will be hard, though not impossible, for the Russians to advance from there and to threaten the much bigger cities of Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, which would then become vulnerable to artillery. It is possible that Ukrainian-held areas in the region could be encircled. From the Ukrainian perspective, General Melnyk says that the point of continuing to fight to retain the town, even at a high cost, is also symbolic, but it plays an important role in tying down a large number of Russian troops. General Melynk thinks that even if it is lost it could be recaptured later. But not all commanders think it is worth it in terms of the heavy casualties. \u201cIf it was up to me I would pull out,\u201d says another.\n\n>The general hastens to add that there is no room for complacency.

As a large Turkish Kipir armoured car drives past, a couple of soldiers reach for their phones to identify it.\n\n>Morale remains high, and Ukraine\u2019s soldiers are learning from experience. Sergeant Vasyl Dubovyi\u2019s team have parked in a small wood giving onto frozen fields within earshot of the Bakhmut front. Before the invasion he was a business analyst. The team tug white webbing over their vehicle to help camouflage it from Russian drones. In the distance there is the sound of rocket and artillery fire.

The orcs are continuously forcing them to retreat against their will, while taking heavy casualties too. \n\nBut how can that be the case if Col Maestro and \"Sargeant\" Dubovyi are militarily crushing it?\n\nCould it be that article from the Economist that was written anonymously might not be 100% accurate? Are the Ukrainians not actually crushing it? \n\nIf that's true, what could be the motive to write a bullshit article filled with fluff? Let's check the last paragraph for a hint:\n\n>Yet the Ukrainians say that while they have the weapons and manpower to hold off the Russians, they don\u2019t have enough of the former to launch their own full-scale counteroffensive.

Ukrainians are awesome but need more to take back their country. \"Buy War Bonds, Feed the guns and beat the ~~Huns~~ orcs.\"\n\n>From the Ukrainian perspective, General Melnyk says that the point of continuing to fight to retain the town, even at a high cost, is also symbolic, but it plays an important role in tying down a large number of Russian troops.\n\nYeah, this makes sense.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>It&#39;s amazing how great the Ukrainians are doing in Bakhmut. Nice to know they&#39;re winning!</p>\n\n<p>Oh wait, they&#39;re not. The orcs are continuously forcing them to retreat against their will, while taking heavy casualties too. </p>\n\n<p>But how can that be the case if Col Maestro and &quot;Sargeant&quot; Dubovyi are militarily crushing it?</p>\n\n<p>Could it be that article from the Economist that was written anonymously might not be 100% accurate? Are the Ukrainians not actually crushing it? </p>\n\n<p>If that&#39;s true, what could be the motive to write a bullshit article filled with fluff? Let&#39;s check the last paragraph for a hint:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yet the Ukrainians say that while they have the weapons and manpower to hold off the Russians, they don\u2019t have enough of the former to launch their own full-scale counteroffensive. This will depend on the alignment of three factors. Time, troops being ready (including those now overseas learning to use the new Western kit) and finally the delivery of the tanks and other equipment promised by the Western allies. \u201cBut,\u201d asks Sergeant Dubovyi, \u201cwhen will he arrive? </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ahh, okay,, so it&#39;s a propaganda ad for more military aid, that makes more sense. Ukrainians are awesome but need more to take back their country. &quot;Buy War Bonds, Feed the guns and beat the <del>Huns</del> orcs.&quot;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>From the Ukrainian perspective, General Melnyk says that the point of continuing to fight to retain the town, even at a high cost, is also symbolic, but it plays an important role in tying down a large number of Russian troops.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yeah, this makes sense. Tie the Russians up in Bakhmut by defending, following a year old &quot;hold at all cost&quot; strategy through the fall and winter so Wagner can&#39;t be used in all those other places that are important. Because if the Ukrainians didn&#39;t defend the Russians would go elsewhere...</p>\n\n<p>Who is the military genius who said this?</p>\n\n<p>Oh, <a href=\"https://legalforum.nlu.edu.ua/en/speakers/serhii-melnyk/\">this guy</a>, a JAG officer, lol.</p>\n</div>",

Russia has stationed its military in Abkhazia and South Ossetia since then, occupying about of fifth of Georgian territory that remains internationally recognized as part of the Caucasus republic.\n\n>>\u2018Big Mistake\u2019\n\n>Without requiring Russia to make a full withdrawal as part of surrender terms, \u201cthe western world will make another big mistake \u2014 as big as 2008, 2014,\u201d Zourabichvili said, referring to Moscow\u2019s 2014 annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimea. \n\n>Almost a year since Russia invaded Ukraine, the outcome of the war remains far from clear as the two sides prepare for potentially decisive battles in the spring. Ukraine\u2019s US and European allies have stepped up shipments of arms to bolster Kyiv\u2019s forces against a large-scale offensive that officials fear Russia may be planning.\n\n>French-born Zourabichvili\u2019s criticisms of Russia put her at odds with Georgia\u2019s government, which has been careful to avoid antagonizing Putin over his invasion of Ukraine. \n\n>While he has condemned Russia\u2019s \u201cunjustified\u201d aggression, Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili hasn\u2019t imposed sanctions on Russia and has refused to provide military aid to Ukraine, accusing critics of his policy last month of seeking to \u201ccreate a second front in Georgia.\u201d \n\n>The nation of less than 4 million people expanded trade with its neighbor to the north and welcomed tens of thousands of Russians who fled the country with savings in hand, resulting in a $2 billion windfall for Georgia\u2019s economy last year. \n\n>Zourabichvili, 70, was elected in 2018 as Georgia\u2019s first woman president, a largely ceremonial role though she is formally commander-in-chief. She made clear in the interview that she recognizes the limits of her ability to affect policy, though she also said her outspoken stance in support of Ukraine enjoys popular backing among Georgians.\n\n>>EU, NATO\n\n>Still, she conceded the authorities had to be \u201cmore careful\u201d given Georgia\u2019s status as a country under partial Russian occupation and lacking the protections of countries in the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, both of which it aspires to join.\n\n>Georgia\u2019s EU ambitions took a knock in June when member states awarded candidate status to Ukraine and neighboring Moldova, putting them on a path to join the bloc, while telling Tbilisi that it still needed to meet specific conditions to achieve the same category.\n\n>The European Parliament has censured Georgia for repressing media freedoms and backsliding on judicial reform and civil liberties \u2014 including those of former President Mikheil Saakashvili, who\u2019s currently hospitalized while serving a jail sentence his supporters say is politically motivated. Georgia\u2019s government denies the accusation.\n\n>Saakashvili was detained in October 2021 after entering Georgia for the first time since stepping down at the end of his presidency in 2013. He fled abroad when the ruling Georgian Dream party founded by his billionaire rival Bidzina Ivanishvili, the country\u2019s richest man, accused him of abuse of power. The government says he crossed into Georgia illegally. \n\n>Zourabichvili, who has the power to pardon the leader of the country\u2019s 2003 pro-European Rose Revolution, wouldn\u2019t comment on her plans but said she didn\u2019t think \u201can individual case will determine our European future.\u201d \n\n>Though Georgia has fallen short in meeting some EU demands, in part because of political divisions, the president said the time has come for a \u201cstrategic decision to be taken by Europe.\u201d The country can\u2019t afford another failure to win formal candidacy, which could embolden Russia by presenting Georgia as a \u201cgray zone\u201d for its ambitions, she said. \n\n>>\u201cYou have to give us candidate status,\u201d Zourabichvili said. \u201cWe aren\u2019t perfect, I know that there are things that we have not been doing, but I think that despite all that we need to move forward.\u201d\n\nJust to be clear, this is interview wasn't with Garibashvili, but Zourabichvili .",

They form new reserve battalions around existing professional battalions garrisoned in Russia, at bases where theoretically there is sufficient cached equipment to quickly arm the new formations. The professional units then train the reservists before they rotate into combat and a fresh batch of trainees arrives. Again, in theory. But that could look like what you describe as refilling units in Russia, even if they are actually going through something vaguely akin to Russia's doctrine for mobilization training. Russia's foreign commitments also didn't number more than a few thousand troops in total before the war anyway, so that can't be absorbing huge numbers either. \n\nOn the other hand, Russia has resorted to committing many of the training units themselves to combat, which in turn has dramatically reduced their capacity to absorb new recruits. Before the war, [they were training around 400k conscripts per year](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/5/5/are-russian-conscripts-fighting-in-ukraine). If they committed a mere 25% of their training units to combat, that would mean they can now only integrate around 300k new conscripts per year. Or 150k every six months. And now it sounds like they were able to train about 150k in the four months since mobilization began. Which adds up if they're cutting corners or rotating experienced units out as trainers under the cover provided by the initial \"meat grinder\" wave of completely untrained mobiks. Probably both. It wouldn't be Russia if they weren't cutting corners to cover up horrific waste of life. \n\nPerhaps that undercuts my point a little, but I struggle to imagine what rear area units would be worth stocking with fresh, untrained mobilized soldiers. Just logistics units, but the Russians are struggling not with operational depth logistics but instead with last mile delivery off the railhead into combat zones. So maybe they have untrained soldiers training untrained soldiers, which as absurd as it sounds would not surprise me at this point. Grab the five dudes who can read instructions correctly and make them officers, then hand them a training manual and tell them to do what it says. Or maybe they really are training albeit perhaps with some form of scaled down professional supervision, or only in relatively limited numbers. \n\nI really hope they are not actually using untrained soldiers for internal security though, because it is often a recipe for excessive violence against civilians (think Kent State). Not that I doubt it, because the chance for brutality may very well count as a positive in the Kremlin's eyes.",

If its shortened, then only some will grasp the materials while others wont, and that's fine if they are okay with a high drop rate, to be recycled or booted out if they can't meet the standard, but when Ukraine needs intact crews completing training together then they need all of them to \"pass,\" though the reality is passing is guaranteed because they wont be training to an actual standard, because that's impossible with the language issues, foreign cultures, potential discipline problems, politics, and definitely the abbreviated lengths.  \n\nAnother issue with lengthening the training days and removing most or all days off is fatigue, not only for trainers but students as well. There is only certain amount of information, especially technically related, that can be crammed into someone's head before it becomes \"in one ear and out the other.\" \n\nThere is always a tradeoff developing military training, especially if its technical, to try to remove unnecessary stressors (like sleep deprivation) when its not needed for a specific lesson, as they can be harmful to training value. Its why the best military courses are typically \"gentlemens' courses\" that don't have all the screaming and heavy handed discipline, because people learn better when they're not under heavy stress. That said, those are still needed at times, its best to add those in as part of the course's culminating event, the \"final test\", usually a field training exercise done at the end of training (which themselves can be longer and more complex with longer training). \n\nAdditionally, lengthy training allows for higher repetition; lessons from day 1 can be repeated for 10 weeks and sink in deeper than 5 weeks. \n\nLastly, resources are another factor that might limit how abbreviated training can be. For instance, western armies generally have tank simulators, special driver trainer variants, etc, that are in limited number. If training is cut down in time it puts more strain to use these limited resources, which means time on them also needs to be cut, and also literally puts strain on them mechanically, as they aren't meant to be run at a higher level than they normally are (ie, if the simulator breaks, then no simulator time until its fixed).  \n\nThat said, time can be cut out of the typical training standard. But I'm getting really tired of these 3-5 week courses that Ukraine is pushing for, for all western training since the war started, while trying to sell that as quality. Its not, its literally designed for one thing: quantity. And while \"quantity might have a quality of its own,\" it isn't when there are a very limited number of these AFV that Ukraine is getting. Which means they should be taking every step to maximize how well they use them, instead of cutting corners in every way possible, which essentially guarantees they'll not come close to reaching the capabilities of those systems.",

We do not have evidence that the mass killing of Ukrainians is a specific top-down policy.

Cultural destruction does not suffice, nor does an intention to simply disperse a group.\n\nThe only thing that may actually apply here are the deportations of Ukrainian children to Russia, although it's unclear what the scope, scale, and separation policy actually looks like (i.e., are these orphans? Are they being separated from their parents? Was any attempt made to contact existing family?), etc. Not to split hairs here, but genocide has a specific definition. \n\nEthnic Cleansing is probably the more *specific* crime or action being committed here, but the definition of \"ethnic cleansing\" is.. fuzzy at best. Don't wall non-ideological wars between nation states (or wars of conquest) involve the destruction of a state and by extension significant violence inflicted on the body-politic of that nation state?
