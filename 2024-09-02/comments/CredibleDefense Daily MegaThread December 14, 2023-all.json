        "body": "Found [this fascinating interview with the commander of the Ukrainian 56th Motorized Infantry Brigade](https://archive.is/8WlHo) that I thought was worth sharing. The article is in French, but Google Translate seems to work well enough. \n\nSome interesting points:\n* The commander suggests that it will become impossible for Ukraine to hold the line if the quantity of artillery ammunition delivered to Ukraine continues to decline. Artillery rationing on the Ukrainian side seems pretty severe, even at key points along the line. Claims that the Russians opposite his unit have 30 Msta-B howitzers, 2 Tornados, as well as grads, and have fired 5,000 rounds in the past 24 hours. **\"There has never been such asymmetry!\"**\n\n* The brigade's previous headquarters was destroyed by Russian missiles, they've been operating out of an underground HQ near Kramatorsk for the past 6 months. \n\n* The commander claims that at one point in the line, a position held by 5 to 8 Ukrainian soldiers has been attacked relentlessly by 120 Russian soldiers split into 11 assault groups for the past 3 days. These attacks are carried out from multiple directions at once, and are being conducted by Russian convict units who were trained by Wagner. Ukrainians have been able to hold the Russians off due to drone surveillance and artillery. \n\n* Commander claims that wounded Russian convicts are not evacuated and that their dead are left to rot. (Personal note: this might explain some of the footage we've been seeing of fields strewn with Russian corpses.)\n\n* Explains that for Ukrainian wounded, 5 soldiers are sent for each casualty: 4 to evacuate the wounded, 1 to replace them on the line. Claims chance of survival by evacuation is about 70%, but falls to 10% if position is abandoned. \n\n* Claims that his unit is producing FPV munitions and antipersonnel mines in Kramatorsk using 3d printers, that drones are being used to place antipersonnel mines taken from abandoned Russian positions in Kherson last year, and that FPV drones are helping to alleviate artillery munitions shortage. \n\n* Commander's unit lacks manpower such that he's unable to rest his troops or provide them with training. \n\n* Commander says that the Caesar is extremely vulnerable, drawing counter battery fire in just 3-4 minutes, and that due to its size its very hard to get it out of the danger zone. He further claims that M777s can fire 300 rounds per day on average, versus just 5 for Caesars. Suggests that M777s are easy to conceal and are protected by anti-drone metal screens. Another commander claims that Caesars are highly susceptible to dirt, forcing their users to wear gloves and shoe covers to keep them very clean, comparing Caesar operators to \"surgeons\" and also that Caesars need a satellite link to operate properly (aim) but that this makes it harder to hide them as Russians can track their emissions. (Personal note: I find these anecdotes highly interesting. Open source data suggests the opposite of what they're saying, that towed artillery is highly susceptible to counterbattery fire while SPGs are less so, as M777s have suffered much higher attrition than any SPGs. But this suggests the reason why so many towed artillery pieces have been knocked out is actually because they're used much more often and effectively than SPGs, once again hinting at the limitations of drawing conclusions from OSINT.)",

Often suppression (temporary halt of enemy arty firing) or neutralization (extended delay with more losses) was just as good if it meant less enemy arty firing against friendly maneuver forces likely conducting an attack.\n\nThat's where the shoot and scoot tactic came from. Due to counterbattery radars and such being able to detect the location of the massed firing batteries, they'd need to fire and then move out of the expected impact area, they've set up again somewhere else and get ready to fire again. \n\nWithout air superiority, in a pre-drone ISR age, there was no way to spot enemy artillery using aerial reconnaissance, so radars and sound systems to find the enemy. Definitely no way to use precision guided munitions to try to get a catastrophic kill (k-kills, enemy equipment destroyed as a total loss).\n\nA few things changed that doctrine before this war and greatly since it started. Russian prevalence of drones as part of a deliberate use of targeting for fires (they call it Recon Fires Complex), which was only possible with modern ISTAR drones, Integrated Communications Management (ICM) to have instant ability to use the drones and communicate, and precision guided weapons to hit whatever was spotted.\n\nOn top of that, this war is positional, so suppression of enemy artillery is often seen as less valuable than trying to permanently kill it; why waste ammo to temporarily halt it firing if you can destroy it? \n\nSo what's likely happening now is the Russians are using two means to destroy UAF arty, primary is Lancet drones, secondary is PGM laser guided arty. Both are intended as k-kills.\n\nThe former only requires knowing the general area where an enemy arty piece fired, at which point a Lancet drone can be launched to head there, try to find it and hit it (or hit something else that looks valuable if it can't find the artillery piece). \n\nAdditionally, any type of ISR drone doing recon over the Ukrainian tactical rear area, which is regularly done because the UAF have no reliable way to stop it, might spot the UAF arty firing or moving during displacement. They have a kill chain where the drone footage is visible to the same command level who controls the fires, so they can very quickly have a Lancet launched that'll be assisted in guidance by the overwatching drone (which is why a lot of Lancet drone strike footage has an accompanying other drone footage showing the terminal approach and detonation), increasing the likelihood of a k-kill. \n\nFor PGM arty, laser guided Krasnopol, while they are roughly the same cost as a Lancet there are less of them in the supply system, they have greater value going against other targets that Lancets aren't very effective against (bunkers, dismounts in the open), and can only be guided by specific ISTAR drone types that can act as laser target designators, so it's not surprising that Lancet have taken over the role of counterbattery, while augmented by commercial FPV drones that the Russians are now pumping out with very high levels.",

Against an enemy with effective counterbattery system in place, not just the radars and other equipment but with a fire control and doctrine and command/control/communication system put into place, it was imperative for survival to pick up and move quickly. But the artillery didn't need to move too far, because unless the enemy had air superiority then they would be denied aerial recon, which meant they'd not know where their enemy's artillery was until they fired again. \n\nFast forward to the age of drones, and that changed. The enemy might not actually have 24/7 aerial recon over the front lines and tactical rear area (up to where the artillery is generally located), but since there is no way to stop them or detect them, it's safe to assume they are there. They aren't just using drones to spot targets, now they're primarily relying on them to destroy them too.\n\nWhich means the new name of the game is to hide from drones. \n\nWhich requires dispersing artillery batteries so they're all firing individually (which can be mitigated by modern fire control software and ICM). And it means using maximum camouflage to better hide from aerial observation. Which for this war is largely done by hanging out in treelines, using natural vegetation plus camo nets, while often setting up counter FPV net screens to protect against those weapon systems. \n\nAt a minimum, friendly arty on both sides up front providing fire support, but not actively firing are trying to use those positions to hide in between fire missions. If they're using smaller pieces that can better dig in and hide, they can even fire from them. Otherwise, they have to move out from them, to the corresponding fields next to the treelines, fire, and then move back to the hide site. \n\nBut because outgoing fire is likely to be detected and draw a drone, or because there might have been a drone already there that caught the firing signature, it's very imperative after firing not to be moving around too much outside of cover and concealment, because then they can be spotted and engaged with a FPV drone, which have decent hit probability against moving targets. \n\nThis is the exact same issue both sides are having with tanks and IFV/APC, they can't hide more than a small number near the front line, so they must disperse them in their rear areas. If they mass them to attack, they must conduct their approach march on the exact routes enemy drones are most likely already focusing on, so they get spotted before even reaching the attack position. If by chance they aren't caught then, the enemy defenses are alerted to the massed attack and soon the sky is filled with drones, who are either directing fires or themselves acting as FPV strike weapon systems. Without the ability to hide well in the tactical rear, they have no hope of hiding on the front lines, so they continuously get picked off until someone orders them to retreat back outside common drone range. \n\nDismounted troops and small numbers of armored fighting vehicles can better hide near the front lines before an attack, and the former especially can better hide during and after an attack especially, by digging in.

                "body": "> Also does unanimous mean everyone who is present at the vote and not everyone who is eligible?\n\nEveryone who is present. Leaving the room is the PR and plausible deniability stunt behind a qualified abstention.\n\n(Edit: to clarify, the voting procedure of the Council requires unanimity of affirmative votes on this particular topic. Countries are allowed to abstain, but it's pretty infrequent for that to happen on a matter specifically related to the EU and its community policy. That's what the Council most commonly works on, though, so you don't hear about it too often. An abstention is not equivalent to a negative vote: a country can qualify its abstention and issue a declaration on why it did not vote for a particular proposal, but it doesn't block it in so doing, and effectively accepts the proposal as binding for the EU.\n\nI'm not sure if this is *formally* an abstention, as there are some rules about what constitutes a full quorum for unanimity which I'm not entirely familiar with and I'm also not sure what Orban actually said or did prior to leaving the room. But in any case, Orban's physical absence would not have been an obstacle.)\n\nIMHO the point of the posturing, and of then abstaining, is two-fold: first, to make it clear to its Russian backers that Hungary did not engage in hostile backroom dealing on the matter, and second, to keep options open for communications with his voters. The latter point is probably the most important so I'm going to start with that one.\n\nHungary has expended enormous political capital on this matter, and that has been a largely destructive process so far: Hungary now has less resources than it could have had (some, but not all of the EU funds to which it would've otherwise been entitled to by default have been unblocked, a net financial loss so far), has compromised its relations with the largest member of the Visegrad group (Poland) and mostly blew up the Visegrad group altogether, at least in the short term. Its foreign policy has been based on isolationism and exploiting divisions between their peers for more than a decade now: unsurprisingly, that's led to Hungary becoming politically isolated as soon as there were no trivial divisions for them to exploit through opposition.\n\nIt's critically important for Orban to keep this failure behind a smokescreen, for three reasons:\n\n1. Orban's whole foreign policy shtick has been to play a tough \"sovereignist\" game because it would allow Hungary to play a greater role in foreign policy than the evil Soros-controlled interests in Brussels alotted it. That has only led to Hungary playing a *lesser* role, and being alotted fewer resources, with less influence. It's a personal failure, and far-right voters do not take kindly to leaders who personally fail.\n\n2. This failure reveals Orban's entire foreign policy to be hollow: its based on \"playing tough\" with Brussels but ultimately Hungary runs on EU money. Failing to align itself to Russian interests may have major economic consequences for Hungary, and political consequences for Orban in particular; but failing to align itself with *EU* interests to the point where it's denied EU funds is potentially catastrophic. Economically first of all, but also socially: EU membership facillitates jobs, exchange programs and mutual investments that keep \"the economy\" running smoothly as in, keep people employed and happy. Most Hungarian citizens don't give a flying fawn about Russia, but would absolutely hit the streets if EU membership came under question. A big part of Orban's power base comes from the highly stable character of his regime, and it's important for that stability not to be challenged.\n\n3. Last, and most important, and related to my previous point about the Visgrad group: another one of Orban's shticks was that he's not tough because he's a dictator, he's tough because he's protecting \"European values\" and \"European civilization\". That's a PR line that worked when Poland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, and Austria to some degree, also took a tough stance. It's not as easy to insist you're protecting European values and civilization when voting *against every single European nation*, including your former allies in said protection of European values.\n\nSo it's extremely important for Orban to be able to show his voters that he took no part in this, that he was against it, and Hungary continues to be against it and keeps fighting the good fight. Is that bollocks? You bet it is: Hungary was against it but was powerless to prevent it, precisely because of the isolation that Orban cultivated; it continues to be against it, but the relevance of its position is ever-waning; and at least the current phase of \"the good fight\" is done and Hungary has lost it. But it's important for the Hungarian public not to dwell too much on it because if they do, Orban's power base is as good as gone.\n\nThe former point is important precisely because of this context. Hungary's economic relations with Russia are less important than their economic relations with the EU but, for better or for worse, they are a lifeline, fragile but not ineffective, in case relations with the EU further deteriorate. The ties of the Hungarian government with Russia are important both for their immediate, informal advantages (e.g. intelligence) and for their indirect support (the Hungarian government can always remind its critics from Brussels that things could be worse: they're close to Russia, but they could be closer, and Hungary does not depend on the EU as much as, say, the Baltics).\n\nThat's a relation that goes both ways: Russia's relation with Hungary, close though it may be, is still largely adversarial. Hungary is a NATO member and a close economic partner of Russia's major enemies. Russia can abandon Hungary much more easily than the EU can, so Orban needs to show Putin he's a good boy and won't even think of *appearing* to have colluded with Russia's enemies.\n\nMaking a show out of Hungary's abstention is a big, big part of Orban's communication game here. It needed to happen both before the abstention, hence the posturing, and after, hence the whole leaving the room thing. Otherwise, Orban can't tell his supporters that he had no part in this and that he did not compromise with the people he swore not to compromise with, and he can't convince Putin that this is not Hungary switching geopolitical gears to the side that has more money and a bigger share of the Hungarian border.",

Hungary&#39;s economic relations with Russia are less important than their economic relations with the EU but, for better or for worse, they are a lifeline, fragile but not ineffective, in case relations with the EU further deteriorate. The ties of the Hungarian government with Russia are important both for their immediate, informal advantages (e.g. intelligence) and for their indirect support (the Hungarian government can always remind its critics from Brussels that things could be worse: they&#39;re close to Russia, but they could be closer, and Hungary does not depend on the EU as much as, say, the Baltics).</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s a relation that goes both ways: Russia&#39;s relation with Hungary, close though it may be, is still largely adversarial. Hungary is a NATO member and a close economic partner of Russia&#39;s major enemies. Russia can abandon Hungary much more easily than the EU can, so Orban needs to show Putin he&#39;s a good boy and won&#39;t even think of <em>appearing</em> to have colluded with Russia&#39;s enemies.</p>\n\n<p>Making a show out of Hungary&#39;s abstention is a big, big part of Orban&#39;s communication game here. It needed to happen both before the abstention, hence the posturing, and after, hence the whole leaving the room thing. Otherwise, Orban can&#39;t tell his supporters that he had no part in this and that he did not compromise with the people he swore not to compromise with, and he can&#39;t convince Putin that this is not Hungary switching geopolitical gears to the side that has more money and a bigger share of the Hungarian border.</p>\n</div>",

It isn't a coincidence that the National Rally has systematically underperformed other parties in number of seats relative to its share of the vote. Even worse, a major reason why PR was abolished in the first place was to wipe the National Front (former name of the National Rally) out of parliament.\n\nThat all goes back to my initial point - Hungary is not significantly out of line compared to at least some other EU states on every metric they're criticized on. The main distinguishing factor is a dislike of Orban's policies, especially his foreign policy, but this has little to do with whether the country is democratic, especially considering those policies are popular domestically.",

They already almost would have reached it on PR alone, because ~5% of the PR vote was wasted on parties that failed to reach the threshold. In a FPTP system with a 15% lead nationally, they would likely get more than 66% of those seats without gerrymandering either, though Fidesz might not have reached the supermajority by itself.\n\nFrom looking at Hungary's electoral map, it seems the gerrymander primarily relies on packing, i.e. concentrating opposition voters in very safe constituencies (almost all of them in Budapest), thereby putting constituencies that should have been competitive with a popular vote parity out of their reach. This is a great strategy to win in terms of sets despite being slightly behind in popular vote, but it also means the opposition has a much higher floor, and therefore winning a massive amount of seats in a good election year (like 2022) is more difficult. I think this explains why the gerrymander wasn't all that impactful in the 2022 election.\n\nThat said, I do get your point that they were still able to reach that supermajority in previous elections when their results weren't as good (though this seems to be explained by a very fragmented opposition rather than gerrymandering - a bit like how Thatcher got 61% of the seats in 1983 with only 42% of the vote), and that the system being unfair in a competitive election will obviously have an impact on voter motivation, especially in the long run.\n\nHowever, this isn't outside the norm for Western democracies, which is why I think it's a massive stretch to single out Hungary as \"not a democracy\" (rather than, say, an \"imperfect democracy\") for this.

Let's return to these goals: they have not changed. I'll remind you of what we talked about then: the denazification of Ukraine, its demilitarization, its neutral status.\"\n\n> \"As for demilitarization, if they don't want to come to an agreement, then we are forced to take other measures, including military ones. Or we will agree on certain terms. By the way we agreed on these in talks in Istanbul. But then these agreements were scrapped. But we agreed on this. There are other possibilities - either reach an agreement or resolve it by force. This is what we will strive for.\"\n\n> \"Almost along the entire front line, our armed forces, let's say modestly, are improving their position. Almost everyone is in an active stage of action. Our troops' situation is improving throughout.\"\n\n> **ON RELATIONS WITH THE WEST**\n\n> **\"The unbridled desire to creep towards our borders, taking Ukraine into NATO, all this led to this tragedy.

They forced us into these actions...**\n\n> **What the United States conceived and organized, Europe stands and silently watches, or plays and sings along with them there. Well how can we build relations with them?\"**\n\"When internal changes happen (in the United States), **when they start respecting other people, other countries, when they start looking for compromise instead of trying to resolve their issues with sanctions and military intervention**, then the fundamental conditions will be in place to restore fully-fledged relations. So far, such conditions are not in place, but we are ready for that.\"\n\n> **\"As for the 'rules-based order', there are in fact no such rules.

We... have a legitimate desire to see how roubles are accumulated, how they move around, where they go and in what volumes.\"\n\n> **ON RUSSIAN HOSPITAL IN GAZA**\n\n> \"When I visited the United Arab Emirates I found out they have set up a field hospital there in Gaza, near the Rafah checkpoint... and we talked about the possibility of Russia setting up a hospital in the same location, at a stadium, but that would of course require approval from both Egypt and Israel. I have spoken to the Egyptian president, he support this idea. I have spoken to Prime Minister Netanyahu, they have discussed this between various agencies, and the Israeli side does not support this, they believe setting up a Russian hospital in Gaza would be unsafe, but this does not mean we will cease those efforts.\"\n\n> **ON RELATIONS WITH CHINA**\n\n> \"We know and I will simply repeat this, I must repeat this, the level of our ties with China is at an all-time high.\"\n\n> **ON POSSIBILITY OF SECOND MILITARY DRAFT**\n\n> \"We had a partial mobilization, we called up 300,000 people... The guys are fighting well, really well. Fourteen heroes of Russia. I think 244,000 are in the special military operation zone... After that, we started a campaign to attract people on a voluntary basis to sign contracts with the armed forces. As of yesterday evening, I was informed we now had come up with 486,000.\"\n**\"The flow of men ready to defend our homeland with arms in hand is not decreasing. Together with volunteers, there should be around half a million people. There is no need for mobilisation as of today.\"**\n\n> **ON THE ECONOMY**\n\n> \"The most important indicator is economic growth. **GDP growth by the end of the year is expected at 3.5%** - this is a good indicator, it means we have recovered from last year's fall... and we have made a relatively seriously step forward.\"\n**\"Unfortunately, inflation has increased. By the end of the year it is expected at 7.5%, maybe a little more at 8%, but the central bank and government are taking necessary measures.\"**\n\nThe level of hypocrisy is astounding, but not unexpected.\n\nHe still doesn't show any intention of letting go, and is dead set on painting 'The West' as its enemy. I know the common line of thinking is that 'it's just for internal consumption', but I don't think it bodes well for events in the future.

It didn't go anywhere because it was very poorly devised, but it set the tone for subsequent UN proceedings. Western representatives took forever to mobilise, long enough that the UN ended up debating only one of the obstacles towards a ceasefire (Israel's bombing campaign and poor handling of humanitarian aid), with barely any time afforded towards the other (i.e. the giant, state-funded terrorist organisation across the border that broke the two-year long ceasefire in the first place and now insists on another one). That allowed Russia to galvanize support for an emergency session focused only on Israeli action, in which it absolutely dominated the public space.\n\nWestern diplomats had everything they needed to stop Russia from using the conflict in Gaza against them. Russia's conduct in Ukraine ticks all the boxes of Israeli policy in Gaza, and more. Despite claiming to be in favour of peace, its president had the party that broke the 2021 ceasefire over for talks. It called for a ceasefire when Israel launched its offensive but not when Hamas launched its attack.\n\nIf Western diplomacy weren't so reactive, Russia couldn't touch this with a ten-foot pole without coming out as a party working to undermine the stability of the Middle East at the expense of a nation on whose goodwill they're highly dependent on for their economic income (i.e. Saudi Arabia).

The Soviet Union was forced to play second fiddle throughout 1982, both because its partisan politics in the Middle East caused dissensions amongst Arab countries to the point where they would've made things worse and because Troyanovski's mere presence inevitably shifted debates towards the Soviet Union's endless supply of weapons to both legitimate governments and terror groups in the region being a major obstacle to peace. \n\n*Of course* Russia didn't create this condition, it's not like they're the ones who attacked Israel on 7/10.
