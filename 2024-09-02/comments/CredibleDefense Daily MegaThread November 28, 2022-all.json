It heightened throughout the summer, then collapsed after the Kharkiv counteroffensive (save a certain someone who keeps spamming posts about Lancet missiles). In the last few days, it seems like this trend has picked up again. IMO we got spoiled between late August-Mid November with formal announcement of the Kherson counteroffensive, the Kharkiv counteroffensive, mobilization, annexation, the Kerch bridge bombing, and then culmination of the Kherson counteroffensive. It's literally been barely two weeks since Ukraine took Kherson. Despite that, I see more voices calling this as a frozen conflict.\n\nWhat I want to point out is that there were people calling a slowdown around this time of year months ago. We all knew that November and December bring the Rasputitsa/Bezporizhzhia, depending on the language. There was always going to be a slowdown. It's not fair to expect literally the poorest country in Europe to engage in two ambitious counteroffensives and continue without stopping in the middle of mud season. Some Ukrainian politicians (cough cough Kuleba) make the situation sound desperate, but remember that they're engaging in squeaky wheel diplomacy (not to discount them--they have every right to do so given the circumstances). Everyone just needs to take a couple deep breaths and understand that things will get better. IMO the war still trends heavily in favor of Ukraine. To those panicked about no new weapons systems deliveries, what I would say is that they have proven to do damn well with the assets they have. I would love as much as anyone else to see them get F-16s, M1A1s, ATACMs, and Davy Crockett nukes, but they're doing damned fine with M777s and HIMARS. Ukraine has liberated a shitload of territory with these weapons. This is already and will continue to be a long war, so I would encourage everyone to maintain some optimism. Since the end of March I've held that Ukraine would retake all of their territory save Crimea--and while I might be ambitious, I have hope I might yet be proven wrong on the last.",

While Ukraine has outperformed expectations, not giving them more AFVs and artillery to close out the fight right now is still giving them a 10 foot ladder to climb a 20 foot wall (and we're not getting the ladder back).  It's complete nonsense.  Also, this is something I've opined repeatedly on in July and August (back when the situation was far less clearly in Ukraine's favour), so I **still** don't understand how I became head optimist in the eyes of so many people, but that's beyond the point.\n\nHowever, my thoughts that Ukraine is absolutely in one of its best case scenarios as seen from April are absolutely unchanged.  I'd go as far as saying it's inarguable.  \n\nMoreso in this comment I'm pointing out that Ukraine's situation right now is better than it was in the rough days of \"phase 2\", June and July, but people were generally more optimistic then than they are now.\n\nWhich yes, I find hilarious given that, again, Ukraine's accomplished if not exceeded all reasonable expectations that one could have had back then.

If frustration was truly \"boiling over\", Kuleba would tie the two together. He's been nothing but direct and blunt so far, and it would definitely be a change in style for him to be coy like that.\n\n\nThe whole push for negotiations is coming from sources other than the prime leadership - it's the opinions of dissenters. And the whole weapons shipments thing has been discussed ad nauseum. The West has reasons (of various validity) for withholding weapons of different types, and Ukraine, even if they understand those reasons, is not going to be happy. And I'm definitely not saying that Kuleba should placidly accept that, quite the opposite. It's literally his job to advocate for his country in the way he thinks would be most effective, and as always, I think he's doing it well. \n\n\nThis is an understandable conflict between allies, and will be resolved as such.

Kuleba is clearly downplaying the reports of negotiations and emphasizing the proactive and not reactive requirement for aid to help. If frustration was truly &quot;boiling over&quot;, Kuleba would tie the two together. He&#39;s been nothing but direct and blunt so far, and it would definitely be a change in style for him to be coy like that.</p>\n\n<p>The whole push for negotiations is coming from sources other than the prime leadership - it&#39;s the opinions of dissenters. And the whole weapons shipments thing has been discussed ad nauseum. The West has reasons (of various validity) for withholding weapons of different types, and Ukraine, even if they understand those reasons, is not going to be happy. And I&#39;m definitely not saying that Kuleba should placidly accept that, quite the opposite. It&#39;s literally his job to advocate for his country in the way he thinks would be most effective, and as always, I think he&#39;s doing it well. </p>\n\n<p>This is an understandable conflict between allies, and will be resolved as such. I highly doubt it will progress into a serious rift.</p>\n</div>",

So I think that it would be beneficial to shed some light on the process based on Russian sources.\n1. Military infrastructure in Russia in last decade was supposed to train approx. 60'000 conscripts twice a year. All officers and many soldiers were on paid contracts for many years, so the number of conscripts was steadily declining, and training infra shrinking.\n2. Not all conscripts were going through training centers, some got training in their military units. Now those units are in Ukraine or as reserves nearby, so training there is very limited. Many experienced officers from training centers are also in Ukraine on rotational basis.\n3. Both Putin and Shoigu stated that out of 300+ thousands mobilized up to 80'000 were sent to Donbass, Zap. and Kher. Oblasts. We should remember that this does not mean that they were sent to combat. DPR and LPR have their own training centers which were active for last 5-8 years and still function. So for now we probably have approx. 310-350'000 mobilized (counting volunteers and \"500s\" (professional soldiers who left service during SMO and were forced to rejoin), up to 100'000 are close to front lines or already in combat units (mostly on Svatovo-Kremennaya line, which was the most problematic in November), 60-100'000 training inside Russia with weapons and infrastructure and, finally, up to 150'000 in reserve awaiting their turn for training, living in field camps, dormitories, sport centers etc. The last category is the main source of complaints, alcoholism, misconduct and lack of equipment.\n4. Interesting note to take about complaints and protests of mobilized men and their relatives is that they mostly do not demand to be demobilized, sent to safe places Far East or march on Kremlin. Similarly to many Ukrainian videos with poorly trained mobilized TD units, wives and mothers, they ask for equipment and better training, their morale is more damaged by idleness and lack of competent officers than by mobilization and war itself.\n5. Given all of above. As I see it, currently Russian plan is something like this. Saturate combat units to their full strength (already mostly done, some brigades (Marines, VDV) are even reformed to divisions instead of brigades) -> complete creation of new regiments, brigades and divisions (many reports on those) -> train remaining 100-150'000 awaiting troops to use as reinforcements -> train autumn conscripts for reserve units defending Russian borders -> be ready for the next wave of mobilization if needed (I predict this new wave to happen close to next summer).\n6. We can laugh on videos and mock \"mobiks\" all we want, but Russia is preparing for protracted war and almost tripling in size their ground forces, so it's better, IMO, to prepare for some unpleasant surprises.",

The isthmus presents a significant geographic barrier, with only 20 km or so of actual land to cross. A tactical strike could cause significant Ukrainian casualties, create panic in the rest of the country, force an operational pause (for Ukraine; to deal with fallout/panic/equipping for further nuclear strikes; for Russia; to allow some breathing room and to further build up defenses), and potentially provide a contaminated barrier to any incursions. I do agree this would further degrade Russia\u2019s international standing, and contribute to pariah status, but I don\u2019t think it is outside the realm of possibility if Putin, the siloviki, and the greater Russian political establishment view a potential loss of Crimea as an existential threat. *However*, I do not think nuclear weapons employment in actual combat is likely as of this time. The most I could see would be a demonstration shot with zero casualties, but that likely has very high costs for little/no reward.",
