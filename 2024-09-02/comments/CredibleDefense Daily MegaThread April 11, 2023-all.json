E is probably double the cost. \n\n>I get they are different platforms with different capabilities, but ignoring the costs of actually flying the plane and only focusing on acquisition costs seems short sighted\n\nBut they are different platforms with different capabilities.

Plus there&#39;s little reason to think China is unhappy with the status quo which allows them to portray the US as interlopers, Taiwan as a misguided breakaway territory, and fire up the nationalist passions of the Chinese citizen body at will as a means to distract from domestic issues. </p>\n\n<p>The only problem I see with China&#39;s peaceful reunion strategy is that their heavy-handed absorption of Hong Kong decades earlier than they promised killed pretty much any interest among the Taiwanese at reunification. The Taiwanese know how much they stand to lose from joining the PRC as the CCP would not tolerate them having the freedoms and self-determination they have today. There&#39;s little reason to think the Taiwanese would be more economically prosperous within China as well.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "Reading [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/12hgop4/credibledefense_daily_megathread_april_10_2023/jfswjqu/) in the previous thread I thought it may be a good time to have a conversation about \"_strategic ambiguity_\".\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# What is strategic ambiguity?\n\nEssentially as I understand it strategic ambiguity is the idea that if you lay out clear red lines for your government then other actors are able to perform a concrete calculus on when it is worthwhile for them to overstep your boundaries and so there is an increased likelihood of escalation. By deliberately obfuscating the possible responses to certain escalations you can increase the risk of an uncontrolled outcome for any actor that tries to undermine your interests and therefore the overall likelihood that other actors will try something escalarory is reduced.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# Strategic ambiguity in practice\n\nOr so the theory goes, in any case. In practice when we reflect on the times that the policy has been implemented it's a catalog of failure. The overwhelming majority of the time that a country's strategic ambiguity has been tested the response was found wanting.\n\nThis is because in the cases where it is employed the actual commitment to a response is almost always low to nonexistent. The great paradox of the theory is that in order to be effective there has to at least be some concrete risk associated with violating a grey line but whenever the risk actually becomes substantial then boundaries and conditions will almost always become more clear.\n\nAnother issue with employing these strategies in a democracy is that power is shared and so even if a specific part of the government has a concrete idea of how they should respond to a violation if people in other parts of the government or the general population or even other allies don't reach the same conclusion then a decisive response can rapidly become neutered or nonexistent.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPossibly the most fundamental issue of strategic ambiguity though is that credibility is bought with precedent. If you lay out concrete responses for any given challenge then every time you follow through or fail to follow through on your commitments you set the expectation for how you will respond to future challenges.\n\nStrategic ambiguity doesn't free you from these constraints, if anything it hugely excasurbates them. When you adopt such a posture you inherently accept that whenever you are challenged that the response you produce may ultimately be underwhelming or nonexistent. Every time you produce a weak response you embolden other actors to push your boundaries even further until eventually they might find themselves on the wrong side of a red line and both you and the actor responsible will find yourself paying an extremely heavy price when a more accurate risk assessment could have prevented the escalation entirely.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Reading <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/12hgop4/credibledefense_daily_megathread_april_10_2023/jfswjqu/\">this comment</a> in the previous thread I thought it may be a good time to have a conversation about &quot;<em>strategic ambiguity</em>&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h1>What is strategic ambiguity?</h1>\n\n<p>Essentially as I understand it strategic ambiguity is the idea that if you lay out clear red lines for your government then other actors are able to perform a concrete calculus on when it is worthwhile for them to overstep your boundaries and so there is an increased likelihood of escalation. By deliberately obfuscating the possible responses to certain escalations you can increase the risk of an uncontrolled outcome for any actor that tries to undermine your interests and therefore the overall likelihood that other actors will try something escalarory is reduced.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h1>Strategic ambiguity in practice</h1>\n\n<p>Or so the theory goes, in any case. In practice when we reflect on the times that the policy has been implemented it&#39;s a catalog of failure. The overwhelming majority of the time that a country&#39;s strategic ambiguity has been tested the response was found wanting.</p>\n\n<p>This is because in the cases where it is employed the actual commitment to a response is almost always low to nonexistent. The great paradox of the theory is that in order to be effective there has to at least be some concrete risk associated with violating a grey line but whenever the risk actually becomes substantial then boundaries and conditions will almost always become more clear.</p>\n\n<p>Another issue with employing these strategies in a democracy is that power is shared and so even if a specific part of the government has a concrete idea of how they should respond to a violation if people in other parts of the government or the general population or even other allies don&#39;t reach the same conclusion then a decisive response can rapidly become neutered or nonexistent.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Possibly the most fundamental issue of strategic ambiguity though is that credibility is bought with precedent. If you lay out concrete responses for any given challenge then every time you follow through or fail to follow through on your commitments you set the expectation for how you will respond to future challenges.</p>\n\n<p>Strategic ambiguity doesn&#39;t free you from these constraints, if anything it hugely excasurbates them. When you adopt such a posture you inherently accept that whenever you are challenged that the response you produce may ultimately be underwhelming or nonexistent. Every time you produce a weak response you embolden other actors to push your boundaries even further until eventually they might find themselves on the wrong side of a red line and both you and the actor responsible will find yourself paying an extremely heavy price when a more accurate risk assessment could have prevented the escalation entirely. I think it&#39;s fair to say that if Russia had been able to forsee the outcome of the Ukraine war they likely never would have committed to it (or might have restrained their actions exclusively to the Donbass), for instance, but even the west was unaware of how extreme the response would be.</p>\n\n<p>This increased risk of escalation when boundaries are actually violated is the price that has to be paid to steal some extra deterence in cases where you otherwise wouldn&#39;t respond.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h1>Effective implementation</h1>\n\n<p>Of course that doesn&#39;t mean that strategic ambiguity is always useless; in some cases there is simply no way to prove with precedent the conviction behind a country&#39;s claims until they are tested (particularly when it comes to things like nuclear doctrine).

Andrews is a former senior U.S soldier and decorated intelligence officer who conducted global counterterrorism operations on behalf of the United States during a 36-year military career. Shortly after returning from an overseas mission, he began to suffer from rare, life-threatening ailments that defied medical explanation. Rather than succumbing, he instead began to experience special, inexplicable abilities such as remote viewing, and his body began to heal, baffling doctors.\n\n> As he sought more information about his health, Andrews came across a file compiled for him by his late father. It contained records from a past he did not remember, including documents indicating he was removed from school for weeks every year, from the first through 12th grades. The records also contained a shocker, that he received an honorable discharge from the U.S Air Force and worked in space intelligence communications as a minor. Andrews maintains he has no memory of having served in the U.S Air Force.\n\n> Referred to a classified White House National Security Council program, which had been delegated to the Department of Defense, Andrews then met a man who ran the highly classified program, who introduced him to a doctor. The doctor had worked for the CIA and had expertise enabling him to help Andrews start to piece together what has happened to him and others like him. Soon after connecting with the doctor, Andrews says he experienced symptoms associated with the Havana Syndrome, a phenomenon first reported by military personnel working at the U.S. Embassy in Havana, Cuba, in 2016. The syndrome has generated significant media attention in top-tier outlets including *60 Minutes* and *The New York Times* in recent years. An investigation went on to determine that Andrews had been targeted with an advanced energy weapon.\n\n> The memoir is repped by manager and producer Dan Farah, who is also handling life rights and producing the adaptation for film or TV, as well as\u00a0book agent Yfat Reiss Gendell of YRG Partners. Foreign publishing rights will be shopped at next week\u2019s London Book Fair.\n\nThis seems like a bunch of nonsense, in my opinion, but it'll be interesting to see what kind of reception the book gets once it's published.",
