As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster. Don't abuse it though! If something is not obviously against the rules but you still feel that it should be reviewed, leave a short but descriptive comment while filing the report.",

Apparently you had to be there to get the full results, but there was a visitors day where interested parties (police, border security, foreign militaries etc) could see certain things.\n\nAn Australian company was there (the one that provides remote weapons stations for Bushmasters etc) and [they seemed fairly happy to show off](https://australianaviation.com.au/2023/02/eos-and-droneshield-compete-in-counter-drone-event/)\n\n> \u201cOur participation not only allowed us to get third-party verification of our achievement at various ranges and targets using our technology, but we could also demonstrate that to NATO-affiliated countries.\n\n> \u201cWe have an interim series of results (from our hard kill lethality). We were constrained to engage drones with machine gun on remote weapons system. We achieved static and moving engagements at 300 metres, 500 metres, 800 metres against targets that are less than 30 centimetres or 10 centimetres high.\n\n> \u201cIt showcased, even with a standard weapon system, we could engage successfully and destroy small commercial drones and potentially higher-end drones with relatively cheap, standard ammunition.\n\n> We can kill a maverick or low-end group one drone for about $5 or $10 with ammunition you already have and a weapon you already have.\u201d",

For starters, I've always judged that if a war is to break out over Taiwan, it will be the inverse of the Cuban Missile Crisis. The reason is mostly political and diplomatic. While I don't doubt a sudden invasion would perhaps be the stronger military move, the slow constricting blockade will deliver far more political benefits. The PRC would be able to sell to the world (at least, the Global South bits) that Taiwan is an errant province run by a rebel governor, and that a blockade is required to prevent hostilities from the US-supplied rebels. This would then fracture a strong global response against the PRC--outside of AUKUS for instance, I don't think many European countries would be keen for a conflict, especially with the Russian threat still so strong. E.g. beyond moral support, countries like Germany and the Czechs will send little in the way of help. They won't support China, but they also definitely won't immediately rush to Taiwan's defense.\n\nFurther, the way a blockade would work is that the PLAN would set up an interdiction against all traffic going into Taiwan--and when Taiwan fights back, the PRC could claim they were attacked first. So the question this begs is: is this it? Have we finally reached the epoch of the Second Pacific War?\n\nLet me reassure all and say no: I don't think so. Given the limited forces the PRC has allocated, and that they aren't covering the Southern and Eastern approaches to Taiwan (if we take them for their word, that is!), we can probably conclude this is just a test run. Don't get me wrong, the PRC can learn a lot and gather a lot of data that helps a future blockade op, but I don't think we're about to see the flare up of blockade and war this week.\n\nI think the PRC leadership will definitely continue these exercises, and I do think 'by 2027' is a reasonable metric. But they can afford to be a little more patient. The years 2024-2025 will be critical in deciding the future of the strait. Taiwan's key ally, America, could elect Trump again, whom you can reasonably predict proposing a 'big beautiful trade deal' that greenlights a PRC invasion of Taiwan in return for massive trade benefits for American manufacturing and agriculture. Ukraine or Russia could collapse, either of which would augur political and economic crisis in Europe, thus weakening the united democratic front the US has been building. Taiwan's upcoming elections could also sweep into power a more conciliatory stance vis a vis the PRC. Further, OPEC could trigger a third oil crisis, or Israel could attack Iran--either of which will send energy prices skyrocketing and cause global economic panic.\n\nIn sum, the PRC has everything to gain by waiting until mid-2025 at the earliest. The way I see it, their position can only improve with time. Plus, each month that there isn't a war, is another month spent producing missiles, refitting old tech, and pumping out new tech. And depending how history plays out, a massive invasion might not even be needed--truly the best case scenario for the PRC.",

They can make some net group by moving up the value chain still, but they are facing some significant headwinds in the years to come. </p>\n\n<p>I talked about those issues in this comment \n<a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/12bgw15/credibledefense_daily_megathread_april_04_2023/jexcser/https://old.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/12bgw15/credibledefense_daily_megathread_april_04_2023/jexcser/\">https://old.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/12bgw15/credibledefense_daily_megathread_april_04_2023/jexcser/https://old.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/12bgw15/credibledefense_daily_megathread_april_04_2023/jexcser/</a></p>\n</div>",

I am just enforcing the very simple and clear rules that we have. \n\n> There's technically \"classification\" on it that's no longer feasible to enforce. \n\nThat's neither your nor my call to make.

NYT story link? Dmitri Alperovitch(he's credible enough right?) retwitting cropped element debunking obvious manipulation of figures?\n\nAnd it's not my call to make for exactly this reason. I can't determine when leaked classified information is sufficiently public so as to no longer be subject to classification. The situation in front of us may not seem like a particularly close call, but most situations are closer calls and the federal government doesn't need one million different people applying their own individual interpretation of what is sufficiently public so as to not be considered classified. Nor do we as moderators of an internet forum have the capacity to make a tricky legal judgment on the fly, within 24 hours of a story breaking.\n\nIf for some mad reason these leaks become a dominant part of the information space such that excluding discussion of them completely prevented all discussion of anything related to Ukraine, maybe your argument would make some sense. But that is decidedly not the case.\n\n> On top of discouraging participation in this sub\n\nYes, that's precisely the point of having rules, discouraging certain kinds of participation that we believe will either detract from the value of the sub or will ultimately discourage more participation than they enable (e.g., tolerating hate speech). We want to discourage using this forum as a place for disseminating or discussing leaked classified materials. It puts many of us in a very difficult position and essentially never adds to the quality of discussion. If you don't like this rule, please feel free to take those discussions elsewhere. \n\nBut if you would prefer to continue to participate here on other topics, we very much want to encourage high quality contributions that rely on credible sources. This particular leak is just about the least credible source imaginable, and the only discussion I have removed was debating its exact accuracy or sharing links to the underlying documents. Getting eyes on the documents was undoubtedly the intention of the parties responsible for leaking it (I mean, why else leak it if not to get people to look at and discuss it?). So you're just falling for their game and participating in the very disinformation campaign you are so eager to debunk.\n\nHeck, it may even be a NATO or US disinformation campaign, so please do not assume I am taking this position out of some blind loyalty to one side or another. Because again, I am not here to push an agenda. At least no agenda other than holding the sub to the high standards of objective discussion I know it is capable of meeting.",

I read the NY Times article, which is how I know the pictures were likely edited and the numbers are therefore not trustworthy, even if the original document was real. Which again means I think it isn't worth discussing here independently of its classification status.

If you were a teenager when those leaks happened and just decided to look at them one day when you were browsing 9gag, no one would care. \n\nIf you have an active security clearance though, you are expected to know and follow the rules, even when you are no longer working in or for the government. Otherwise they'd have to shoot you instead of letting you retire. I doubt something like viewing the original wikileaks files would come up unless there was some concern that arose during the background investigation that merited further investigation. For example, let's say, if you were a frequent poster and moderator on a large defense-focused subreddit, and a brief review of your comments showed you involved in handling classified materials carelessly, that might come up and be an issue.\n\nI won't go into what all is involved in security clearances generally and how something like that might come up incidentally during a routine security clearance investigation, but it's all pretty much public knowledge and you can find lots of recent articles discussing issues with the system. Right now in particular, there is a growing institutional push toward including social media reviews by default in background checks, in which case my comments on this site would 100% be in scope for a background check and there wouldn't even need to be some triggering concern elsewhere in my background requiring close review of my online activities for it to come up.

If you were a teenager when those leaks happened and just decided to look at them one day when you were browsing 9gag, no one would care. </p>\n\n<p>If you have an active security clearance though, you are expected to know and follow the rules, even when you are no longer working in or for the government. Otherwise they&#39;d have to shoot you instead of letting you retire. I doubt something like viewing the original wikileaks files would come up unless there was some concern that arose during the background investigation that merited further investigation. For example, let&#39;s say, if you were a frequent poster and moderator on a large defense-focused subreddit, and a brief review of your comments showed you involved in handling classified materials carelessly, that might come up and be an issue.</p>\n\n<p>I won&#39;t go into what all is involved in security clearances generally and how something like that might come up incidentally during a routine security clearance investigation, but it&#39;s all pretty much public knowledge and you can find lots of recent articles discussing issues with the system. Right now in particular, there is a growing institutional push toward including social media reviews by default in background checks, in which case my comments on this site would 100% be in scope for a background check and there wouldn&#39;t even need to be some triggering concern elsewhere in my background requiring close review of my online activities for it to come up.
