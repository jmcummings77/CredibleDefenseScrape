Rodion Kulagin, commander of artillery of Ukraine\u2019s 92nd Mechanized Brigade.  \n>  \n>In his brigade\u2019s operational area alone, the Iranian drones\u2014which usually fly in pairs and then slam into their targets\u2014have destroyed two 152-mm self-propelled howitzers, two 122-mm self-propelled howitzers, as well as two BTR armored infantry vehicles, he said. Before the current wide-scale use of the Shaheds, Russia carried out a test last month, striking a U.S.-supplied M777 155-mm towed howitzer with the drone, Col. Kulagin said. Another Iranian drone malfunctioned and was recovered, he said.  \n>  \n>So far, the Iranian drones seem to have been mostly deployed in the Kharkiv region, where the 92nd Brigade and other Ukrainian forces carried out a major offensive this month, retaking some 8,500 sq. km of land occupied by Russia and seizing or destroying hundreds of Russian tanks, artillery pieces and armored carriers.  \n>  \n>\u201cIn other areas, the Russians have overwhelming artillery firepower, and they manage with that. Here, they no longer have that artillery advantage, and so they have started to resort to these drones,\u201d Col. Kulagin said.  \n>  \n>Independent experts who examined photographs of recent drone wreckage from the Kharkiv region say that it appears to be Shahed-136, the latest evolution of Tehran\u2019s delta-wing design.  \n>  \n>Scott Crino, founder and chief executive of Red Six Solutions LLC, a strategic consulting firm, said the Shahed-136 could provide Russia with a \u201cpotent counterweight\u201d to the high-tech weapons systems, such as Himars missile launchers, that the U.S. has provided to Ukraine.  \n>  \n>\u201cThe presence of Shahed-136 in Ukraine war is undoubtedly changing the operational plans of Kyiv,\u201d he said. \u201cThe sheer size of Ukraine battlefield makes it hard to defend against the Shahed-136.\u201d  \n>  \n>Mr. Crino said the Shahed-136 can be used with great effect with one targeting a radar system and the second one hitting artillery pieces. Iran also has antijamming systems that can make it hard for Ukrainian forces to counter, he said. \u201cOnce a Shahed locks onto target, it will be hard to stop,\u201d he said.  \n>  \n>Russia\u2019s use of Shahed-136 drones in Ukraine represents the most challenging expansion of Tehran\u2019s arsenal beyond the Middle East, where Iran has successfully used its unmanned aerial vehicles to pressure America and its allies in the region. It also highlights the deficiencies in Russia\u2019s own drone program, which hasn\u2019t been able to match the firepower of armed UAVs deployed by Ukraine.  \n>  \n>Israel and the West have accused Iran and its proxies of flying armed drones to attack Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil industry, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, American soldiers in Syria, as well as tankers in the Gulf of Oman in recent years.  \n>  \n>The British Ministry of Defense, in its intelligence update on Sept. 14, also said it was highly likely that Russia had deployed Iranian drones in Ukraine for the first time. Noting that the Shahed-136 has a claimed range of 2,500 km, it added that so far, it appears that Moscow is using these drones for tactical strikes near front lines rather than to destroy more strategic targets deep into Ukrainian territory.  \n>  \n>The Iranian drones are relatively small and fly at a very low altitude, making it hard for Ukrainian air-defense systems to detect them, Col. Kulagin said. He said he hoped the U.S. and allies could provide Ukraine with more advanced antidrone technologies, or would step in to disrupt Iranian drone shipments to Russia.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/russias-use-of-iranian-kamikaze-drones-creates-new-dangers-for-ukrainian-troops-11663415140](https://www.wsj.com/articles/russias-use-of-iranian-kamikaze-drones-creates-new-dangers-for-ukrainian-troops-11663415140)",

Anti-missile systems are far from 100% effective, so if you fire 100 missiles at a target, at least a few would probably get through. In the context of naval warfare, it's more of an even match; ships and aircraft can only fire so many missiles, and the Aegis System would have an easier time destroying most of them. But suppose the US put a carrier off the coast of China, and China wanted to hit it. Wouldn't it be easy for China to launch far more missiles from land-based batteries? Is the Aegis System really designed to defend against an attack like that?",

The role of copters was discussed throughout 2020-2021, it\u2019s just that someone didn\u2019t give a fuck about the war, so he didn\u2019t hear or know anything.\n\n Further, the author writes that in Russia there is some kind of Phoenix quadrocopter, which no one has ever seen, and I would not have known about it if I had not read it now.\n\n There is also an article about \"Altair\", of which there are a couple of pieces for ALL RF Armed Forces.

None, but how much is the price of ZALA?  Some groups of elite special forces and the DNR OBTF have ZALA, because the police officer Wild was preparing for war in a real way.\n\n \"Orlan-10\" is a workhorse **with a gasoline engine, which makes it extremely vulnerable to MANPADS**.  According to the staff of Orlans, in my opinion, there are 20 units in a brigade (4 crews), but many brigades that lost Orlans back in Gostomel have not received anything in return STILL.\n\n In conclusion, I want to say \"Made by us\": \"Get lost, game!\"\n Because I don't have enough patience for such fools.",

I still can't say with certainty but it seems to me that it could observe a tank from an altitude higher than 3km.\n\n(the reason for the discussion was today's Russian post saying that the Orlan-10 is highly vulnerable to MANPADs because it uses a gasoline engine - which presumably runs hot).",
