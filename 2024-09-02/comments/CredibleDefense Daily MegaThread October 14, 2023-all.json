They had a sizeable force of AFVs and solid air support. Unclear how big the attacking force was since it was an assortment of units attacking on multiple fronts rather than a single combined arms army. \n\n* As of the time of recording (morning of October 12) counts were already as high as 40-50 Russian vehicle losses. \n\n* Russia is clearly still able to generate new forces and equip them, but the force quality and quantity is not sufficient to make meaningful breakthroughs of Ukrainian lines. Ukrainian goal of attriting and pressuring Russian forces over the Winter is meant to prevent Russia from getting time to build and prepare their forced. Kofman sees this offensive as further evidence that Russia will need another wave of mobilization before it will be able to meaningfully restore offensive potential. \n\n* This was a major Russian attack, with several battalions involved, but Ukrainian forces around Avdiivka are deeply entrenched, have plenty of ATGMs and artillery ammunition, and the area is heavily mined so the Russian units attempting a breakthrough were \"decimated.\" \n\n* Early impressions are that it wasn't as foolhardy as the repeated attacks at Vuhledar, but still achieved the same tactical results as those attacks (not much, at high cost). Russia seems to be trying to retake the initiative, take territory before rainy season, and show the Ukrainian offensive has culminated. Kofman doesn't think the Ukrainian offensive has culminated and he sees it as similar to Russian attempted offensives around Kreminna and Kupyansk. \n\n* Ukrainians are very lucky that Gerasimov is in charge of the Russian war effort, as he keeps throwing away these units in attacks that are unlikely to succeed. These units would've been much better suited to defending against the Ukrainian offensive in the South, and could've bought time for Russian forces to stabilize the lines and rebuild offensive potential and made chances of a Ukrainian breakthrough even less likely. \n\n* Kofman thinks people shouldn't panic over Congressional aid to Ukraine, but should be worried. There's still about $5 billion left and this can be stretched for at least several months. He feels pretty confident something will be passed eventually, but he wants to make clear he's no expert on Congress. The optics of the US Congressional chaos is bad, it's hard to argue that the US is committed to aiding Ukraine for the longhaul if were struggling to get an aid package put together a year out from the next Presidental election and so early in the war relatively speaking. \n\n* Ukraine clearly sees an opportunity to build ties with Israel and outmaneuver Russia, Kofman thinks they don't need to rush into this though, and they shouldn't worry too much about the conflict in Israel drawing off too much attention.",

[Oryx lists 309 publicly confirmed BMP-3 losses](https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/02/attack-on-europe-documenting-equipment.html), which means the actual proportion is somewhat higher given Oryx's inherent limitations, including the fact that it does not count losses from increased wear and tear during what will soon become a multiyear high intensity conflict. [Russia has no BMP-3 reserves](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2023/02/21/the-russian-army-is-time-traveling-back-to-1966-as-it-reequips-with-hundreds-of-old-bmp-1-fighting-vehicles/?sh=525b0cca2234), so it has replaced those losses with BMP-2s and BMP-1s. They've also lost something like 1725 BMP-1s and BMP-2s per Oryx, which is roughly half of the active BMP-1/2s that were in service in February 2022, while theoretically there were something like 8600 available in reserves. So on paper, the Russians should not be experiencing limited quantities of IFVs, although the *quality* of their IFV fleet has inarguably been steadily declining as they've replaced newer equipment with older. \n- **Using armored vehicles in a manner not suitable for their design.** At Avidiivka, the Russians used MTLBs with hastily welded on steel plate armor for assault maneuvers. But MTLBs are APCs, and APCs are not designed for fighting, they're supposed to drop troops and run. Whereas IFVs are intended to stay and fight with the infantry they transport, and have heavier armor and weaponry as a result. Hence the hasty upgrades to the MTLBs, which evidently did little to enhance their survivability. The growing use of APCs for assaults suggests even the legacy IFV reserves may be running low, and the quantity of reserves in usable condition is far less than many early western estimates assumed. If only 25% of the reserve vehicles were in usable condition, then they could be close to running out of IFVs entirely already, with only around 425 left to replace future battlefield losses (after accounting for vehicles already taken out of reserve to replace the 1725 losses that have already occurred). They have been losing around 3-4 IFVs per day over the last 600ish days of combat, so that reserve usability rate would suggest they can only maintain the same loss rates for another 106-141 days. Which eerily corresponds almost precisely to the second anniversary of the war. Even if the usable percentage is higher, I think we can infer from the Russians mixing in lower quality APCs for assaults that they are still too close to running out for their own comfort.",

If you aren\u2019t using Twitter anymore, I will post the info below, the links contained in each section will be to any images attached. There is a video in the thread which I can't really link to without you using twitter, it just shows drone footage of a reconnaisance effort. [Original thread in Ukrainian is here.](https://twitter.com/solonko1648/status/1708204916299170013)\n\n> @solonko1648, who's a serving Ukrainian soldier, has published an excellent pair of threads in Ukrainian describing how the Russian system of trenches and firing positions works. It's a very helpful insight into why they have been so difficult to overcome.\n\n> He focuses on a Russian fortified stronghold between the villages of Robotyne and Novoprokopivka, through which the road from one village to the other runs. Tokmak lies further along the same road, which is currently contested. The following thread translates his description:\n\n> [This, dear friends, is one of the most difficult strongholds located in the Robotyne-Novoprokopivka area. A complex system of trenches-tunnels, dugouts, firing positions, to which the Russian invaders cling with all their might... :thread: /1](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F8WXlc8WsAA68M9?format=jpg&name=900x900)\n\n> [What we see first. A system of trenches and firing positions. From observation and tracking of the movements of the occupiers' equipment and personnel, we confirm movement and approach routes to the position. /2](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F8WXpHIXMAA-xmE?format=jpg&name=900x900)\n\n>[ In general, these routes should be obvious, but of course, all the data should be studied and the information verified. That's why this is a formal process. Next, we see from above how these positions are equipped. We see the overlapping of dugouts. /3](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F8WXs5jXwAAXZKL?format=jpg&name=900x900)\n\n> [But that's not all. Some of the trenches are covered over for a long distance. They may not be tunnels in the classical sense, but technically they are. This is actually a trench-tunnel, designed to hide the number of personnel and their movements in the trenches. /4](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F8WXvuBWsAARJu9?format=jpg&name=900x900)\n\n> [With the help of aerial reconnaissance, we determine not only which route the occupiers take to enter/leave.

According to the soldiers of the frontline units, there is a classic tunnel here. It's under the road that leads from Robotyne to Novoprokopivka. It connects both flanks of this system. /6\n\n> Moreover, we also know that dugouts have been dug here, which actually have a second underground floor, going deep into the ground. While we were waiting for the shells, the occupiers were digging. And they dug long and deep. /7\n\n> [After fierce fighting and artillery shelling, our artillery \"opened\" the dugouts and covered trenches. After that, it became clearer how much more difficult the task was. 8/](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F8WYAv1XEAAp9fI?format=jpg&name=900x900)\n\n> [Furthermore, in the area where the main entrance to these positions is located from the west, it is only after a dense artillery barrage that the untrained eye will become aware of how well some of the trench-tunnels on this side were camouflaged. /9](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F8WYCmJW4AANNNS?format=jpg&name=900x900)\n\n> [The occupiers successfully used the forest belt to prepare and camouflage these positions. Such positions require us to conduct very thorough and vigilant reconnaissance.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Interesting thread about Russian trenches. I cannot in any way vouch for the veracity of the original information or of the translation, it <em>sounds</em> accurate to me and matches the images shown, but still bear this disclaimer in mind. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/chriso_wiki/status/1712943815189794868?s=46\">Thread link here</a>. If you aren\u2019t using Twitter anymore, I will post the info below, the links contained in each section will be to any images attached. There is a video in the thread which I can&#39;t really link to without you using twitter, it just shows drone footage of a reconnaisance effort. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/solonko1648/status/1708204916299170013\">Original thread in Ukrainian is here.</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>@solonko1648, who&#39;s a serving Ukrainian soldier, has published an excellent pair of threads in Ukrainian describing how the Russian system of trenches and firing positions works. It&#39;s a very helpful insight into why they have been so difficult to overcome.</p>\n\n<p>He focuses on a Russian fortified stronghold between the villages of Robotyne and Novoprokopivka, through which the road from one village to the other runs. Tokmak lies further along the same road, which is currently contested. The following thread translates his description:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F8WXlc8WsAA68M9?format=jpg&amp;name=900x900\">This, dear friends, is one of the most difficult strongholds located in the Robotyne-Novoprokopivka area. A complex system of trenches-tunnels, dugouts, firing positions, to which the Russian invaders cling with all their might... :thread: /1</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F8WXpHIXMAA-xmE?format=jpg&amp;name=900x900\">What we see first. A system of trenches and firing positions. From observation and tracking of the movements of the occupiers&#39; equipment and personnel, we confirm movement and approach routes to the position. /2</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F8WXs5jXwAAXZKL?format=jpg&amp;name=900x900\"> In general, these routes should be obvious, but of course, all the data should be studied and the information verified. That&#39;s why this is a formal process. Next, we see from above how these positions are equipped. We see the overlapping of dugouts. /3</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F8WXvuBWsAARJu9?format=jpg&amp;name=900x900\">But that&#39;s not all. Some of the trenches are covered over for a long distance. They may not be tunnels in the classical sense, but technically they are. This is actually a trench-tunnel, designed to hide the number of personnel and their movements in the trenches. /4</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F8WXy3BXEAAXLWc?format=jpg&amp;name=900x900\">With the help of aerial reconnaissance, we determine not only which route the occupiers take to enter/leave. We also identify the entrances/exits of this stronghold/trench system. /5</a></p>\n\n<p>A little more about the &quot;tunnels&quot;. According to the soldiers of the frontline units, there is a classic tunnel here. It&#39;s under the road that leads from Robotyne to Novoprokopivka. It connects both flanks of this system. /6</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, we also know that dugouts have been dug here, which actually have a second underground floor, going deep into the ground. While we were waiting for the shells, the occupiers were digging. And they dug long and deep. /7</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F8WYAv1XEAAp9fI?format=jpg&amp;name=900x900\">After fierce fighting and artillery shelling, our artillery &quot;opened&quot; the dugouts and covered trenches. After that, it became clearer how much more difficult the task was. 8/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F8WYCmJW4AANNNS?format=jpg&amp;name=900x900\">Furthermore, in the area where the main entrance to these positions is located from the west, it is only after a dense artillery barrage that the untrained eye will become aware of how well some of the trench-tunnels on this side were camouflaged. /9</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F8WYGYeXAAAWy6Z?format=jpg&amp;name=900x900\">The occupiers successfully used the forest belt to prepare and camouflage these positions. Such positions require us to conduct very thorough and vigilant reconnaissance. The occupiers know what we are interested in and try prevent us from conducting it properly. /10</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisO_wiki/status/1712943848752599088\">You can watch the process in this video. /11</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F8WYSrhWsAA_eR7?format=jpg&amp;name=900x900\">Now I will talk about</a> the eastern <a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F8WYSsXW0AE1VEz?format=jpg&amp;name=900x900\">part of the fortification</a>. /12</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F8WYWeiXYAEbTqB?format=jpg&amp;name=900x900\">It is not so much a separate fortified point as part of an extensive system, overcoming which was an extremely difficult task, taking into account the features of the hostilities, the terrain and the ratio of forces and means that I talked about. /13</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F8WYaRDWYAAeYGJ?format=jpg&amp;name=900x900\">The two main parts of the fortifications are connected</a> by an underground tunnel that runs under the road. <a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F8WYaSAWoAAuSkF?format=jpg&amp;name=900x900\">This way, the road is controlled and still used for its intended purpose. /14\n</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F8WYpJ3WgAAzb99?format=jpg&amp;name=900x900\">Note the shape of the trench in front of the forest plantation</a> (except for the area near the road). <a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F8WYpK1XMAAxYUo?format=jpg&amp;name=900x900\">We have already seen a similar structure on the defence line that stretched northwest of Verbove. /15</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F8WYwV1XAAA0p_X?format=jpg&amp;name=900x900\">Also note another example of the use of terrain.

Total sh_t show. They literally drove an armored column into the city center thinking that would break the will of the rebellion with almost no resistance. Whoops. The rest of that battle was a mix of trying to extracate themselves and then counterattacking to try to crush the resistance in the city, which they finally did but at a greater cost to themselves. A total embarrassment.\n\nThe other battle of Grozny often discussed is the third battle in 1999-2000, when Putin sent the Russian military in and kicked off the war by basically leveling the city with fires. Think of a mix of Mariupol and Bakhmut, but with a less organized resistance. The Russians did what Russians do, a method of fighting very unique to them: extremely heavy use of indiscriminate fires to do most of the work, a total disregard for civilian casualties, and still managing to screw it up because the war went on for addition nine years because they didn't really plan to crush the insurgency when they reignited the war.\n\nFallujah 04 is probably the most apt comparison because the mission is the same. Clear out an urban area because optics are bad for senior political leadership after a massacre, so they order fast and aggressive response by the military to achieve broad aims of wiping out enemy insurgent power in a designated area to send a message. Hopefully this one goes better for the IDF, though I bet it ends for the same reason as the 1st Battle of Fallujah ending, Al Jazeera is going to win the battle for Hamas just as they did 19 years ago, showing civilian casualties on camera.",

During an Oct. 10 address to the nation, Biden condemned Hamas and reiterated U.S. support for Israel, saying, \u201cLet there be no doubt. The United States has Israel\u2019s back. We\u2019ll make sure the Jewish and democratic state of Israel can defend itself today, tomorrow as we always have.\u201d\n> \n> On Friday, Israel ordered 1.1 million Palestinians in northern Gaza to evacuate in 24 hours, despite a warning from the United Nations that the short deadline could be disastrous. The evacuation orders come ahead of Israel\u2019s anticipated ground invasion against Hamas.\n> \n> In recent days, Israel cut off food, water and electricity to the besieged area, where more than 2 million predominantly Palestinian residents have been ruled since 2007 by Hamas, which the United States has designated as a terrorist group. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed that Hamas will pay an \u201cunprecedented price\u201d for its brutal attack and said that Israel\u2019s retribution will \u201creverberate with them for generations.\u201d\n> \n> \u201cWe are in uncharted territory,\u201d said Randa Slim, who directs the Conflict Resolution and Track II Dialogues Program at the Middle East Institute.   \n> \n>   \n> The violent conflict has inflamed long-running animosity between Israel and its neighbors, with Turkey calling that nation\u2019s response \u201ca massacre\u201d and Iran warning that war could spread to other fronts. Israel announced on Friday that it had launched drone attacks against Hezbollah targets, amid other skirmishes along the Lebanese border. On Wednesday, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he \u201cappealed to all parties\u201d to quell violence, release Israeli hostages and respect international humanitarian law. \u201cCivilians must be protected at all times,\u201d Guterres said.\n> \n> Gaza, a densely populated strip of land where about two-thirds of residents already live in poverty, has been under Israeli blockade for 16 years, deemed \u201cunlawful\u201d by the United Nations.   \n> \n>   \n> \u201cWe can\u2019t lose sight of the fact that the overwhelming majority of Palestinians have nothing to do with Hamas and Hamas\u2019 appalling attacks, and they\u2019re suffering as a result as well,\u201d Biden said during a speech in Philadelphia Friday.\n> \n> Leading up to the Oct. 7 assault, Slim said, Israeli leaders underestimated Hamas\u2019 ability to strike and the military and intelligence communities failed to connect the dots ahead of time.   \n> \n>   \n> \n> Slim said that policies and pressure from the far-right Israeli government under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s leadership, particularly in the last year, have helped foster \u201ca place where Hamas can thrive.\u201d\n> \n> But Hamas may have been \u201cmore successful than is good for them,\u201d said Jon Alterman, who directs the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic International Studies. \u201cThe consequence is they\u2019ve united Israel around the idea that they can\u2019t go back to the status quo.\u201d  \n\n> **Where the U.S. stands on the Israel-Hamas War**\n> \n> Following the Oct. 7 attacks, the U.S., India and several nations in Europe have voiced support for Israel in the conflict. That official stance also reflects a majority opinion among Americans.   \n> \n>   \n> \n> \n> * Roughly two-thirds \u2013 65 percent \u2013 say the U.S. should publicly support Israel, with backing from a majority of Democrats, Republicans and independents. At the same time, 8 percent of Americans say the nation should publicly criticize Israel.\n> * Meanwhile, 23 percent of Americans say the U.S. should remain silent and do nothing, including 32 percent of independents, 34 percent of people who are not white and 37 percent of adults under age 45. \u201cYou still have this large, mainstream American political view that\u2019s bipartisan that it\u2019s important to support Israel,\u201d Alterman said. \u201cYou also have an isolationist view that\u2019s growing,\u201d adding that these \u201crising sources of critique were much less widespread even a few years ago.\u201d\n> * In general, the American public has less confidence that support for Israel will bring greater security to the Middle East. Overall, 53 percent of Americans said they think U.S. support for Israel will make the region safer. At the same time, 41 percent said they think it will make the Middle East more dangerous.\n> \n> **How Americans perceive Biden\u2019s leadership during this crisis**\n> \n> * Roughly half of Americans \u2013 52 percent \u2013 do not support Biden\u2019s handling of the war between Israel and Hamas. That includes 80 percent of Republicans and 58 percent of independents. Meanwhile, 44 percent of Americans support how Biden has managed the crisis so far, including 77 percent of Democrats.\n> * When asked in general about Biden\u2019s performance as president, Americans overall are twice as likely to strongly disapprove than to strongly approve, according to this latest poll.  \n> \n> * A plurality of Americans \u2013 44 percent \u2013 see Israel\u2019s military response as being appropriate, this poll found.\n> * Roughly a quarter of Americans say Israel\u2019s military response to Hamas was too harsh, while another quarter said Israel has done too little to react to the attack. Graphic images of the conflict\u2019s toll on civilians have flooded both social media and news coverage. Those images of suffering will fuel \u201cincreased polarization about what to do about it,\u201d Alterman said.  \n> \n> *The PBS NewsHour, NPR and Marist Poll conducted a survey on Oct. 11 that polled 1,313 U.S. adults with a margin of error of 3.8 percentage points and 1,218 registered voters with a margin of error of 3.9 percentage points.*",

The evacuation orders come ahead of Israel\u2019s anticipated ground invasion against Hamas.</p>\n\n<p>In recent days, Israel cut off food, water and electricity to the besieged area, where more than 2 million predominantly Palestinian residents have been ruled since 2007 by Hamas, which the United States has designated as a terrorist group. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed that Hamas will pay an \u201cunprecedented price\u201d for its brutal attack and said that Israel\u2019s retribution will \u201creverberate with them for generations.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe are in uncharted territory,\u201d said Randa Slim, who directs the Conflict Resolution and Track II Dialogues Program at the Middle East Institute.   </p>\n\n<p>The violent conflict has inflamed long-running animosity between Israel and its neighbors, with Turkey calling that nation\u2019s response \u201ca massacre\u201d and Iran warning that war could spread to other fronts. Israel announced on Friday that it had launched drone attacks against Hezbollah targets, amid other skirmishes along the Lebanese border. On Wednesday, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he \u201cappealed to all parties\u201d to quell violence, release Israeli hostages and respect international humanitarian law. \u201cCivilians must be protected at all times,\u201d Guterres said.</p>\n\n<p>Gaza, a densely populated strip of land where about two-thirds of residents already live in poverty, has been under Israeli blockade for 16 years, deemed \u201cunlawful\u201d by the United Nations.   </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe can\u2019t lose sight of the fact that the overwhelming majority of Palestinians have nothing to do with Hamas and Hamas\u2019 appalling attacks, and they\u2019re suffering as a result as well,\u201d Biden said during a speech in Philadelphia Friday.</p>\n\n<p>Leading up to the Oct. 7 assault, Slim said, Israeli leaders underestimated Hamas\u2019 ability to strike and the military and intelligence communities failed to connect the dots ahead of time.   </p>\n\n<p>Slim said that policies and pressure from the far-right Israeli government under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s leadership, particularly in the last year, have helped foster \u201ca place where Hamas can thrive.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>But Hamas may have been \u201cmore successful than is good for them,\u201d said Jon Alterman, who directs the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic International Studies. \u201cThe consequence is they\u2019ve united Israel around the idea that they can\u2019t go back to the status quo.\u201d  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Where the U.S. stands on the Israel-Hamas War</strong></p>\n\n<p>Following the Oct. 7 attacks, the U.S., India and several nations in Europe have voiced support for Israel in the conflict. That official stance also reflects a majority opinion among Americans.   </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Roughly two-thirds \u2013 65 percent \u2013 say the U.S. should publicly support Israel, with backing from a majority of Democrats, Republicans and independents. At the same time, 8 percent of Americans say the nation should publicly criticize Israel.</li>\n<li>Meanwhile, 23 percent of Americans say the U.S. should remain silent and do nothing, including 32 percent of independents, 34 percent of people who are not white and 37 percent of adults under age 45. \u201cYou still have this large, mainstream American political view that\u2019s bipartisan that it\u2019s important to support Israel,\u201d Alterman said. \u201cYou also have an isolationist view that\u2019s growing,\u201d adding that these \u201crising sources of critique were much less widespread even a few years ago.\u201d</li>\n<li>In general, the American public has less confidence that support for Israel will bring greater security to the Middle East. Overall, 53 percent of Americans said they think U.S. support for Israel will make the region safer. At the same time, 41 percent said they think it will make the Middle East more dangerous.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>How Americans perceive Biden\u2019s leadership during this crisis</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Roughly half of Americans \u2013 52 percent \u2013 do not support Biden\u2019s handling of the war between Israel and Hamas. That includes 80 percent of Republicans and 58 percent of independents. Meanwhile, 44 percent of Americans support how Biden has managed the crisis so far, including 77 percent of Democrats.</li>\n<li><p>When asked in general about Biden\u2019s performance as president, Americans overall are twice as likely to strongly disapprove than to strongly approve, according to this latest poll.  </p></li>\n<li><p>A plurality of Americans \u2013 44 percent \u2013 see Israel\u2019s military response as being appropriate, this poll found.</p></li>\n<li><p>Roughly a quarter of Americans say Israel\u2019s military response to Hamas was too harsh, while another quarter said Israel has done too little to react to the attack. Graphic images of the conflict\u2019s toll on civilians have flooded both social media and news coverage. Those images of suffering will fuel \u201cincreased polarization about what to do about it,\u201d Alterman said.  </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>The PBS NewsHour, NPR and Marist Poll conducted a survey on Oct. 11 that polled 1,313 U.S. adults with a margin of error of 3.8 percentage points and 1,218 registered voters with a margin of error of 3.9 percentage points.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

But also during crises the US has in the past either helped Israel broker cease fire agreements OR helped delay cease fire agreements while the Army finishes its work. There has always been some difficulty in that relationship, as early as 1967 US admins have grown frustrated with how quickly Israel can switch from pro-ceasefire to anti-, but ultimately the relationship endured at least up until the 21st century.</p>\n</div>",

Here's the flipside - I'm a tour guide. I'm the only Russian-speaking guide in my company right now, so I ahve to work with Russian tourists.

It's a very candid and very ugly view of the average Russian.\n\n>Even the pro-war Z's aren't exactly lining up to go to war.\n\nHalf a million men showed up for mobilization when it was called, despite the fact that it was extremely easy to dodge and the punishment for dodging it was symbolic.

Additionally, Ukrainians themselves through some questionable actions have played right into the Kremlin's propaganda and have given many Russians a reason to fight. \n\n\nAs [Ekaterina Schulmann points out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_0E9IzXT34) the majority of those aged 45+ support the war. This mean that's mothers and fathers are most often going to be pro-war for various reasons. This coupled with the very generous salaries and signup bonus the soldiers get means that a lot of families have a gross incentive to push their kids to sign up for the war. Russians often mention the 'patriotic duty' but now it's more than that. If you're poor and you have one or two male family members, them signing up could be enough to fix the roof, or get a new car, etc. \n\n\nAdditionally 'doomerism' is also very popular in Russia these days. A lot of young men feel completely hopeless and depressed because they have a window to the outside world (their computer) but they have very few prospects of their lives improving. [Suicide rates in Russia are 2.6 times the average of the EU.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8992693/) It is probably even higher as the Russian government most likely underreports.  It's very hard not to be a doomer when through consumption of Western media you see how good the average Westerner has it and you compare that with your dreary living conditions. To these doomers going to war is actually a win win. Either they do something exciting and make a lot of money or they die. Russia has a large pool of these guys to draft from and no one really cares about them. \n\nAnd the other topic is Ukraine's somewhat recent actions. Earlier in the war we saw Russians talking about how they don't want to fight or they don't know why they're in Ukraine, etc. It made me think the war wont last long because the public just has no desire to fight. But then strangely enough Ukraine started conducting assassinations of mil bloggers and the like inside Russia. Something that has absolutely no strategic value, but it played well into the Kremlin's propaganda. The Belgorod attacks as well. Pointless, nothing came out of them, nothing was ever going to come out of them but it made for amazing news coverage for the Kremlin. All of a sudden the Ukrainians were attacking and killing Russian babushkas. And the Moscow drone strikes. Completly ineffective except for waking up people at night, and causing public panic. [And also Ukraine's strange inability to crackdown on soldiers wearing Nazi symbols](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/05/world/europe/nazi-symbols-ukraine.html). There have been hundreds of examples of Ukrainians uploading footage with Nazi symbolism. [Foreigners that joined to fight for Ukraine have even said the same thing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw0_k53smjs) Every time a Ukrainian soldier uploads something with a Nazi symbol visible all the mil-bloggers have a field day with it, spreading it around and saying \"See, we told you they were a Nazi state!\" \n\nIf before that the average conscript didn't know what he was fighting for now he had a reason - his villages were getting raided now by people wearing Nazi patches, and Moscow was getting bombed! And all of a sudden everything the Kremlin warned about has become true in the eyes of the average conscript. And if the Kremlin was right about these things, maybe they're also right about NATO wanting to invade them as well probably, thinks the average Russian. And you can see how easy it starts to believe that you are actually fighting an existential conflict.  You can see that with how often now Russians refuse to surrender and would rather clutch grenades or die shooting. If they lacked motivation and didn't want to be there they would be surrendering at the first offer. \n\n\nAll of this to say is that unless Russia chews through A LOT of men, more than people can ignore, support for the war will not wane and those fighting will still have a reason to do so.",

How large of a strike package, to include AWACS, CAP, EW, SEAD, CSAR, etc, will be necessary just to get in range? Will ground units perform SEAD and other roles? \n\nThe Ukrainians aren't really trained, equipped, organized to scale up to large strike packages of the sort they'd need to get close enough to the front lines to identify Russian armor and fire on them. And the UAF ground forces are going to have issues trying to do immediate suppression of enemy air defenses to support ground attacks, plus likely reluctant too seeing the attention and ammunition expenditure being wasted when THEY could strike the Russian armor instead, without waiting.\n\nWhen the UAF ground forces spot the Russians, can CAS strike aircraft show up in time? How fast to get in the air, fly potentially long distances from across the country, and before getting on station to communicate with forward air controllers relaying targets and instructions to hit them? \n\nEasier for helicopters, but a lot of their fixed wing regiments are deliberately kept back from the front lines to protect them. At least outside ISR drone range. It hasn't been a problem for them because it seems they only use ground strike tactics as part of deliberately planned operations. \n\nThe only other option is to have strike aircraft or entire packages airborne at any given time, 24/7, waiting to get the call for assistance, but only the US and only a few other militaries have that capability because it's absurdly costly in terms of number of aircraft and units it requires, the operational planning difficulties, and the insanely expensive logistical burdens to fly aircraft around the clock that do nothing but maybe conduct ground attack missions that artillery and other weapons can replicate. In other words, it's a luxury. \n\nAre the pilots and ground observers trained to operate together? Is there someone in every UAF battalion at least that is well trained and experienced to call in airstrikes and give the requisite information the pilots need to know? Who knows how to communicate with them, and do they have the proper equipment to do it? \n\nI can't stress enough, a guy with a radio and a map can't call in effective CAS. It needs to be someone not only well acquainted with ground operations but also an expert in aircraft, their ordnance, and the tactics they use, because that persons job isn't just to relay target info, they need to be able to brief the pilot on everything they need to know to make an attack run and not only hit the target but to try to survive. It's hard, often requires specialist troops from the air force who are permanently attached to ground forces. \n\nWhich pilots are even trained too to perform CAS? \n\nEspecially problematic because the Ukrainian Air Force wasn't really trained for that before the war, besides highly planned operations doing rocket lofting attacks, hasty CAS support would be a brand new skillset for most serving Ukrainian Air Force pilots. One they'd need to perform in non-permissive airspace.\n\nWhat about airspace deconfliction? That's a nightmare to handle but necessary if aircraft start flying inside artillery flight paths. \n\nAnd again I'm going to want to stress how this will be made extra tough because ground force commanders, aka the brigade commanders, aren't going to want to shut down their artillery just so 1-2 SU-25 can show up 30-45 minutes later, probably hours later, and fire some missiles that might or might not hit the targets that need to get hit ASAP. \n\nThose lofting rocket attacks made sense because they replicate arty fires, especially MLRS, allows artillery batteries to save their own ammo with the same effects using up larger stock of . Not the same repelling an active attack with CAS when arty can be faster and more efficient. \n\nPicture it, you're a brigade commander in your tactical operations center, a dozen tablets and laptop screens showing various drone footage, you're literally relaying coordinates and sharing drone footage with artillery units, maybe even dropping Excalibur rounds on the lead tank in a column trying to breach a minefield. Do you want to halt that for at least ten minutes, probably longer, so a few antitank missiles can be fired from kilometers away and maybe hit one of the vehicles in the same column that you're about to destroy yourself. \n\nI don't think most people even realize how impressive the Russian use of attack helicopters actually is. It only works because all the stars align. That's why the UAF need ATACMS with cluster munitions so bad, that alone would totally screw with the Russian ability to use their helicopters effectively, at least forcing them to heavily disperse or more likely moved much further back from the frontlines.\n\nThe cynic in my thinks giving the Ukrainians ATACMS was a deception plan to temporarily stop Russian rotary wing ops as they displaced, buying a month or so of helicopter free operations hoping that would score a win before the mud season starts.",

The leading story on BBC right now is women and young children being killed by the IDF bombing a fleeing convoy of civilians in Gaza. If the Israeli government doesn\u2019t do something fast they\u2019re going to quickly burn up all of the international goodwill that they\u2019ve earned in the last week as the narrative shifts from Israel\u2019s tragedy to their ruthless and heavy handed treatment of Palestinians. Everyone here recognizes that large amounts of civilian casualties are going to be unavoidable in urban warfare at this scale, but Israel absolutely needs to figure out how to demonstrate that they\u2019re showing restraint and taking strong measures to protect innocent civilians.

It's ridiculously easy to bot a narrative on social media, and only the most engaged show up in these spaces anyway. See: Chesa Boudin gets recalled, Bernie Sanders did not even get particularly close to winning the primary, Ron DeSantis is getting absolutely whalloped in the primary, and prior to this attack, pro-Israel was the popular take in the US by a mile. All things that would be inconceivable if social media was an accurate barometer of people's political behavior.\n\nI'd personally say it's pretty even so far. Fox News is very pro Israel contrary to the picture what cherry picked clips might have you think (honestly, voice of america is less pro Israel than they are, and that's literally state media). CNN is pretty neutral (their front page is basically \"Hamas' attack was even worse than we thought\" and \"Israel's call for evacuations were not real\" at the moment). MSNBC is largely ignoring it for some reason. BBC cares substantially less than CNN but has the same vibe where you're getting a roughly equal amount of emotionally charged content both ways. Al Jazeera is unsurprisingly very anti Israel. Voice of America is unsurprisingly very pro Israel. I'm going to stop here because imo the US is the only one Israel really cares about as long as it doesn't step into pure genocide territory, and the BBC's reporting just makes me think that this is largely a middle east/Israel/US story with the rest of the world not caring that much beyond \"it's a thing that's happening\".\n\nI will say that Israel has done a pretty poor job of emphasizing the brutality of the initial attacks. It's out there, but international media seems to have largely not bitten and I'm not sure if there's much to do if the international media is not biting. Their evidence that Hamas was purposefully targeting elementary schools and youth centers was reported without much fanfare. I haven't seen as much discussion about the music festival as you would think given how deadly it was and the sheer density of non Israelis there, but this has definitely still been their biggest win of the information war.\n\n> This is especially true given the upcoming Presidential election in the US, Biden cannot afford to lose even as few as 10,000 votes in key states. If even a tiny fraction of his political coalition refuses to vote for him because casualties are too high in Gaza, he loses. \n\nI'm going to emphasize this in particular because I've seen this sentiment a lot, but pro-Palestine is such a hilariously small minority in US politics that this doesn't matter at all even though the pro Palestine voices are very, very, very loud on the political internet. For better or worse, first past the post voting is government by the moderates, and in the US only people very far left are pro Palestine.  They're enough of a coalition to care about if you're a representative for Portland or San Francisco, but no undecided voter in Michigan is voting for Trump because of Biden's view on Israel. Especially because voting against Biden is voting for even more support for Israel when push comes to shove.",

I&#39;m going to stop here because imo the US is the only one Israel really cares about as long as it doesn&#39;t step into pure genocide territory, and the BBC&#39;s reporting just makes me think that this is largely a middle east/Israel/US story with the rest of the world not caring that much beyond &quot;it&#39;s a thing that&#39;s happening&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>I will say that Israel has done a pretty poor job of emphasizing the brutality of the initial attacks. It&#39;s out there, but international media seems to have largely not bitten and I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s much to do if the international media is not biting. Their evidence that Hamas was purposefully targeting elementary schools and youth centers was reported without much fanfare. I haven&#39;t seen as much discussion about the music festival as you would think given how deadly it was and the sheer density of non Israelis there, but this has definitely still been their biggest win of the information war.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is especially true given the upcoming Presidential election in the US, Biden cannot afford to lose even as few as 10,000 votes in key states. If even a tiny fraction of his political coalition refuses to vote for him because casualties are too high in Gaza, he loses. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I&#39;m going to emphasize this in particular because I&#39;ve seen this sentiment a lot, but pro-Palestine is such a hilariously small minority in US politics that this doesn&#39;t matter at all even though the pro Palestine voices are very, very, very loud on the political internet. For better or worse, first past the post voting is government by the moderates, and in the US only people very far left are pro Palestine.  They&#39;re enough of a coalition to care about if you&#39;re a representative for Portland or San Francisco, but no undecided voter in Michigan is voting for Trump because of Biden&#39;s view on Israel. Especially because voting against Biden is voting for even more support for Israel when push comes to shove.</p>\n</div>",

The death toll of the Iraq war was not small, the war was not necessary, the relative stakes were much lower, and the US has partial responsibility for the later sequelae like the Awakening and ISIS. For more than 10 years the news was dominated by collateral damage from American strikes in the ME. There was a scandal regarding the topic \"disposition matrix\", which refers to very serious questions about how we decided who was a \"combatant\" in the numbers. The figures on civilian casualties vary by an order of magnitude - 100k to 1 million ish and the degree of responsibility gets opaque fast.\n\nThere was no serious military resistance opposing the US in the initial Afghanistan invasion. America could use more discretion because they could invade on their terms. That war was largely rural and not urban, against no serious opponents, and with lower long-term stakes and much less immediacy. There were very few targets to bomb or shoot at. It was frankly very boring for most of the 20 year span even for the soldiers, the US population often forgot we were kinda-sorta-at-war-ish. Many Americans have never met an Afghanistan veteran.\n\nThe US does not knock on roofs. No other air force in the world does. The IAF has stopped that practice for now, but it goes to show that Israel could be vastly more evil than it is. They have no begun to shell, use carpet bombing, NBC, etc. There is still some degree of restraint even though they are rapidly losing the world's sympathy. If their goal is truly to indiscriminately flatten the city, they've chosen a very awkwardly expensive, slow, ineffective and roundabout way to do it.\n\nAmerica has the benefit of being located on the other side of the planet. 10/7 is not really our problem. When we are existentially attacked, we have shown a willingness to torch entire cities to the ground. A number of WW2 bomber leadership said they would be shot for war crimes if the US didn't run the courts. And quite a good deal of the WW2 bombings were arguably not truly necessary or helpful such as the Atomic bombings. Japan may have been brought to its knees by submarines with working torpedoes and Soviet declaration of war without a bomb ever being dropped.\n\nIf we want to compare the whole histories of the nations, the US is almost entirely built on indigenous land conquered through atrocities. The difference is that we were so thorough with our extermination few were left to complain. Hitler himself verbatim described his goals as based on the USA's manifest destiny. Israel never had chattel slavery. American history has some exceptionally rough portions. It's not useful to quantify and weigh them, just don't forget how many bones make up the American throne.\n\nWhat Israel is doing is terrible.

I don't really see much reason to go into Gaza City in any kind of rush since the only real factor that would incentivize Israel to get it done quickly is international opinion, which I don't think is much of a concern to them at the moment.",

It's better to view overall Israeli goals as akin to the Azeri government or Serbia under Milosevic, in that maintaining ethnic supremacy on as much land as possible is fundamental. Elimination of terrorists is a definitely a secondary goal, especially since having a militant faction in Gaza is useful for the primary goal (see the widely reported [comments of Netanyahu](https://www.timesofisrael.com/for-years-netanyahu-propped-up-hamas-now-its-blown-up-in-our-faces/) explaining his previous support for Hamas).\n\nOf course, there is a need for sufficient punishment to satisfy the Israeli public. But this is also a once in a lifetime chance to permanently change the demographic balance of the territory that Israel controls. Hence the intense pressure to get Palestinians out into the Sinai, which so far as not been successful. If that doesn't work, they may try to clear out and occupy the northern half of Gaza, creating an untenable situation in the south that they would hope would eventually cause many Gazans to leave one way or another.

If that doesn&#39;t work, they may try to clear out and occupy the northern half of Gaza, creating an untenable situation in the south that they would hope would eventually cause many Gazans to leave one way or another. If the Israelis aren&#39;t able to take any territory that they would eventually settle, I don&#39;t see the point in taking the losses necessary to eradicate Hamas completely in any area, as long as they and the Gazans are punished sufficiently in the eyes of the Israeli public. There are always proclamations about &quot;eradicating Hamas&quot; every time there is a war in Gaza, but it never seems to happen. Of course, it&#39;s all very unclear at this point, such that even the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-13/israel-hamas-war-after-gaza-strip-invasion-us-fears-lack-of-strategy\">American government isn&#39;t privy to exactly what Israel&#39;s plan is</a>.</p>\n</div>",

All told, the Marine command running the city and area had a full week to plan Operation Vigilant Resolve.\n\nBecause at the time the local Marine unit garrisoning the city had it's Forward Operating Base outside the city, and only a few combat outposts/joint service stations inside, the \"assault\" was launched from outside the city with five battalions (if memory serves) moving on line with one another advancing as they cleared EVERY room in every structure (looking not only for armed enemy but weapons caches too). They got about 1/4 through the city in 3 days, pretty light casualties while extracting heavy casualties on the Iraqi insurgents because they had surprise, but too many civilian casualty photos and videos were broadcasted specifically by Al Jazeera, who were embedded with the insurgents, causing Bush to freak out and call a halt. \n\nThat led to the Siege of Fallujah time period. Initially the Marines held the portion of the city they took, with street battles and lots of sniping happening on the immediate front lines. Meanwhile, Bush et al dallied making a decision. Do they stop and retreat, looking weak? Or do they keep advancing to finish the job, and take the damaging press over heavy casualties right before a major election?\n\nThe answer dropped in Bush's lap when former Saddam Republican Guard general that lived in Fallujah (it was the West Florida for retired Iraqi senior officers) who volunteered to raise loyal militia to protect the city and kick out the insurgents. Sounded great, \"By, With, Through\" to get Fallujah cleared of insurgents and the US didn't need to get its hands dirtier. But the militia raised and armed weren't reliable, as soon as the Marines pulled out and the city was turned over to the Republican Guard ex generals, they all either deserted or joined the insurgents.\n\nBy that point, Bush threw his hands up. Well, eventually. Fallujah had turned into an insurgent controlled city. They weren't just governing it, they were fortifying it too. Eventually Bush gave permission again to clear it, but this time the USMC commanders weren't taking chances and took the time to evacuate most of the civilians. \n\nThen on Nov 7 2004 (notice the significance of the date?), they launched OP Phantom Fury. Again, roughly five battalions advanced on line to clear the city, took about a month and a half. Casualties weren't light, but not too heavy either. Destruction was severe, lots of damage if nothing more than doors kicked in or pockmarked walls from neighborhood firefights. It didn't take long for tactics to emerge that focused on slow and cautious advances, probing to find enemy locations and using heavy weapons, especially explosives, to destroy them. Basically every building the enemy actually occupied during a fight was heavy damaged or destroyed. \n\nThen there was a third battle during the DAESH War in 2016, when Iraqi Security Forces cleared it. \n\nThe Iraqis didn't fortify the city in 2004 and 2016 nearly as much as in places like Mosul in the DAESH War, or Gaza now. Some tunnels but not many. \n\nGaza is going to be like Iwo Jima, the defenders can remain underground except coming to the surface level to man a fighting position that is going to be very hard to spot.

As for optics it would depend on how old the specific robot is, but the newer ones have very high resolution thermal cameras. </p>\n\n<p>You make a good point on how many trained operators Israel actually has. Their VIPeR was what comes to mind as the best tunnel clearance robot. It only weighs 11kg and features high resolution thermal cameras, can mount an uzi and is specially designed to traverse difficult terrain (it can even go up stairs). I do not know how many VIPeR\u2019s Israel actually has though. In 2007 it was relegated largely to their special operations, but that was 16 years ago so maybe it\u2019s filtered down to more conventional units.</p>\n</div>",
