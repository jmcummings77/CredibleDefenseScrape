Specifically, a plot to blow up a pipeline cannot stay 100% hidden from sigint and/or humint. For sigint: the Russian Baltic fleet and the troops in Kaliningrad would be heavily involved in the operation. We know when the pipeline blew up; simply measuring how many signals the fleet was sending during that time could tell us a lot, to say nothing of intercepts and deciphering messages.

        "body": "Almost a year into this tragic war I wanted to reflect on an article published on NVO 3 weeks before the start written by Mikhail Khodarenok who is a reserve colonel in the Russian military where he worked in air defence. The translation is taken from [here](https://russiandefpolicy.com/2022/02/07/mass-fire-strike-on-ukraine/)\n\n>**Predications of bloodthirsty pundits**\n\n>**Of rapturous hawks and hasty cuckoos**\n\n>In Russia\u2019s expert community recently a sufficiently powerful opinion has taken root that it won\u2019t even be necessary to put troops on Ukraine\u2019s territory since the armed forces of that country are in a pathetic state.\n\n>Some pundits note that Russia\u2019s powerful fire strike will destroy practically all surveillance and communications systems, artillery and tank formations. Moreover, a number of experts have concluded that even one crushing Russian strike will to be sufficient to finish such a war.\n\n>Like a cherry on top different analysts point to the fact that no one in Ukraine will defend the \u201cKiev regime.\u201d\n\nBy now it is fairly safe to say that the Russian leadership severely underestimated the ability of Ukraine's military to improve since 2014 and their will to resist Russian influence. Khodarenok seems well aware of the contrary.\n\n>**IT WON\u2019T BE A CAKE WALK**\n\n>Let\u2019s start with the last. To assert that no one in Ukraine will defend the regime signifies practically a complete lack of knowledge about the military-political situation and moods of the broad masses in the neighboring state. And the degree of hatred (which, as is well-known, is the most effective fuel for armed conflict) in the neighboring republic toward Moscow is plainly underestimated. No one in Ukraine will meet the Russian army with bread, salt and flowers.\n\nThis proved to be completely correct but also implies that many Russians had the wrong expectations.\n\n>It seems events in south-east Ukraine in 2014 didn\u2019t teach anyone anything. Then they also figured that the entire left-bank Ukraine in one fell swoop and ticked-off seconds would turn into Novorossiya. They already drew the maps, thought out the personnel contingent for the future city and regional administrations, worked out state flags.\n\n>But even the Russian-speaking population of this part of Ukraine (including also cities like Kharkov, Zaporozhe, Dnepropetrovsk, Mariupol) didn\u2019t support similar thoughts by a huge majority. The \u201cNovorossiya\u201d project somehow imperceptibly deflated and quietly died.\n\nWe now know that Kharkiv, Zaporizhia and Mariupol all offered stiff resistance (The Russians didn't reach Dnipro though they still deal with missile strikes).\n\n>In a word, a liberation crusade in 2022 in the form and likeness of 1939 won\u2019t work in any way^[1]. In this instance the words of Soviet literature classic Arkadiy Gaydar are true as never before: \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that now we won\u2019t have an easy battle, but a hard campaign.\u201d\n\n>**\u201cWITH LITTLE BLOOD, A POWERFUL STRIKE\u201d**\n\n>Now about \u201cRussia\u2019s powerful fire strike,\u201d by which \u201cpractically all surveillance and communications systems, artillery and tank formations of the VSU^[2]\u201d will supposedly be destroyed.\n\n>Only in this single expression it\u2019s apparent that only political workers could say such a thing. For reference: in the course of hypothetical military actions on the scale of a theater of military operations [TVD] strikes on priority targets and mass fire strikes are delivered. We note in the course of operational-strategic planning the adjectives \u201cpowerful\u201d (and also \u201cmedium,\u201d \u201cweak,\u201d etc.) aren\u2019t used.\n\n>In military science it\u2019s emphasized that strikes can be strategic (this for the most part relates to strategic nuclear forces), operational and tactical. According to the forces which will participate and the targets which will be destroyed strikes can be mass, group and individual. And it\u2019s altogether better not to introduce or use other definitions even in works of a political nature.\n\n>Strikes on priority targets and mass fire strikes can be delivered in the bounds of a front (fronts on Russia\u2019s western borders still haven\u2019t been formed) or a main command of armed forces in a theater of military operations (such a thing also hasn\u2019t yet been established in the South-Western strategic direction). Anything less than this isn\u2019t a mass strike.\n\nI take this as him implying that as of 3 weeks before the start of the invasion Russian forces had no centralised command structure and proper strategic and operational planning for the striking of priority targets which are points that have since been echod by western military analysts.\n\n>And what is, for example, a front mass fire strike (MOU)? For starters we note that the maximum number of combat ready forces and means of aviation, missile troops and artillery, EW systems at the disposal of the commander of a front (an operational-strategic large unit) are engaged in the MOU. The MOU is one mass sortie of aircraft, two-three launches of OTR^[3] and TR^[4] systems, several artillery fire bombardments. It\u2019s good if the degree of fire destruction to the enemy in this is 60-70%.\n\nThough some airfields and radar installations were hit in the first days, this mass fire strike didn't end up happening. Probably because they assumed they could take Ukraine quickly and didn't want to destroy the critical infrastructure they were about to control.\n\n>What is the main thing in this question as it applies to a conflict with Ukraine? It goes without saying that the MOU will visit heavy losses on a probable enemy. But to count on only one such strike to crush the armed forces of an entire state means that simply unbridled optimism has appeared in the course of planning and conducting combat operations. Such MOUs have to be delivered not once and not twice, but much more often in the course of hypothetical strategic operations in a TVD.\n\nUnfortunately this has become a reality with Russia's campaign against Ukraine's critical infrastructure.\n\n>To this it\u2019s certainly necessary to add that supplies of prospective and highly-accurate weapons in the VS RF^[5] don\u2019t bear any kind of unlimited character. \u201cTsirkon\u201d hypersonic missiles still aren\u2019t in the armory. And the quantity of \u201cKalibrs\u201d (sea-based cruise missiles), \u201cKinzhals,\u201d Kh-101 (air-launched cruise missiles) and missiles for \u201cIskanders\u201d in the very best case number in the hundreds (dozens in the case of \u201cKinzhals\u201d). This arsenal is completely insufficient to wipe a state on the scale of France with a population of more than 40 million from the face of the earth. And Ukraine is characterized by exactly these parameters.\n\nMost analysts were surprised by Russia's ballistic and cruise missile reserves or their willingness to deplete it. Partially because they didn't count many missiles that were primarily intended to be used against ships. Russia nevertheless must have had considerable stocks before the war including the parts to manufacture more despite sanctions. He was correct though that even those deep stocks are probably not enough though that may in part be due to the lack of coordinated use up until late 2022.\n\n>**ON AIR SUPERIORITY**\n\n>Sometimes in the Russian expert community it\u2019s asserted (by the followers of Douhet\u2019s doctrine^[6] ) that since hypothetical combat operations in Ukraine will be conducted in conditions of full Russian air superiority the war will be extremely brief and will end in the shortest time.\n\n>But it\u2019s somehow forgotten that the armed formations of the Afghan opposition in the conflict of 1979-1989 didn\u2019t have a single aircraft or combat helicopter. And the war in that country stretched out for a full 10 years. Chechen fighters didn\u2019t have a single airplane. And the fight with them continued several years and cost federal forces a great deal of blood and victims.\n\n>And the Armed Forces of Ukraine have some combat aviation. As well as air defense means.\n\n>In fact, Ukrainian crews of surface-to-air missile troops (scarcely Georgian) substantially stung the Russian VVS^[7] in the course of the 2008 conflict^[8]. After the first day of combat operations the Russian VVS leadership was obviously shocked by the losses sustained. And it wouldn\u2019t do to forget about this.\n\nAs a former officer in air defence, Khodarenok knows well the danger of SAM systems in the modern battlefield and the VVS' shortcomings in the fields of SEAD/DEAD. \n\n(cont)",

They already drew the maps, thought out the personnel contingent for the future city and regional administrations, worked out state flags.</p>\n\n<p>But even the Russian-speaking population of this part of Ukraine (including also cities like Kharkov, Zaporozhe, Dnepropetrovsk, Mariupol) didn\u2019t support similar thoughts by a huge majority. The \u201cNovorossiya\u201d project somehow imperceptibly deflated and quietly died.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We now know that Kharkiv, Zaporizhia and Mariupol all offered stiff resistance (The Russians didn&#39;t reach Dnipro though they still deal with missile strikes).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In a word, a liberation crusade in 2022 in the form and likeness of 1939 won\u2019t work in any way<sup>[1].</sup> In this instance the words of Soviet literature classic Arkadiy Gaydar are true as never before: \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that now we won\u2019t have an easy battle, but a hard campaign.\u201d</p>\n\n<p><strong>\u201cWITH LITTLE BLOOD, A POWERFUL STRIKE\u201d</strong></p>\n\n<p>Now about \u201cRussia\u2019s powerful fire strike,\u201d by which \u201cpractically all surveillance and communications systems, artillery and tank formations of the VSU<sup>[2]\u201d</sup> will supposedly be destroyed.</p>\n\n<p>Only in this single expression it\u2019s apparent that only political workers could say such a thing. For reference: in the course of hypothetical military actions on the scale of a theater of military operations [TVD] strikes on priority targets and mass fire strikes are delivered. We note in the course of operational-strategic planning the adjectives \u201cpowerful\u201d (and also \u201cmedium,\u201d \u201cweak,\u201d etc.) aren\u2019t used.</p>\n\n<p>In military science it\u2019s emphasized that strikes can be strategic (this for the most part relates to strategic nuclear forces), operational and tactical. According to the forces which will participate and the targets which will be destroyed strikes can be mass, group and individual. And it\u2019s altogether better not to introduce or use other definitions even in works of a political nature.</p>\n\n<p>Strikes on priority targets and mass fire strikes can be delivered in the bounds of a front (fronts on Russia\u2019s western borders still haven\u2019t been formed) or a main command of armed forces in a theater of military operations (such a thing also hasn\u2019t yet been established in the South-Western strategic direction). Anything less than this isn\u2019t a mass strike.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I take this as him implying that as of 3 weeks before the start of the invasion Russian forces had no centralised command structure and proper strategic and operational planning for the striking of priority targets which are points that have since been echod by western military analysts.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>And what is, for example, a front mass fire strike (MOU)? For starters we note that the maximum number of combat ready forces and means of aviation, missile troops and artillery, EW systems at the disposal of the commander of a front (an operational-strategic large unit) are engaged in the MOU. The MOU is one mass sortie of aircraft, two-three launches of OTR<sup>[3]</sup> and TR<sup>[4]</sup> systems, several artillery fire bombardments. It\u2019s good if the degree of fire destruction to the enemy in this is 60-70%.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Though some airfields and radar installations were hit in the first days, this mass fire strike didn&#39;t end up happening. Probably because they assumed they could take Ukraine quickly and didn&#39;t want to destroy the critical infrastructure they were about to control.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>What is the main thing in this question as it applies to a conflict with Ukraine? It goes without saying that the MOU will visit heavy losses on a probable enemy. But to count on only one such strike to crush the armed forces of an entire state means that simply unbridled optimism has appeared in the course of planning and conducting combat operations. Such MOUs have to be delivered not once and not twice, but much more often in the course of hypothetical strategic operations in a TVD.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Unfortunately this has become a reality with Russia&#39;s campaign against Ukraine&#39;s critical infrastructure.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>To this it\u2019s certainly necessary to add that supplies of prospective and highly-accurate weapons in the VS RF<sup>[5]</sup> don\u2019t bear any kind of unlimited character. \u201cTsirkon\u201d hypersonic missiles still aren\u2019t in the armory. And the quantity of \u201cKalibrs\u201d (sea-based cruise missiles), \u201cKinzhals,\u201d Kh-101 (air-launched cruise missiles) and missiles for \u201cIskanders\u201d in the very best case number in the hundreds (dozens in the case of \u201cKinzhals\u201d). This arsenal is completely insufficient to wipe a state on the scale of France with a population of more than 40 million from the face of the earth. And Ukraine is characterized by exactly these parameters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Most analysts were surprised by Russia&#39;s ballistic and cruise missile reserves or their willingness to deplete it. Partially because they didn&#39;t count many missiles that were primarily intended to be used against ships. Russia nevertheless must have had considerable stocks before the war including the parts to manufacture more despite sanctions. He was correct though that even those deep stocks are probably not enough though that may in part be due to the lack of coordinated use up until late 2022.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>ON AIR SUPERIORITY</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sometimes in the Russian expert community it\u2019s asserted (by the followers of Douhet\u2019s doctrine<sup>[6]</sup> ) that since hypothetical combat operations in Ukraine will be conducted in conditions of full Russian air superiority the war will be extremely brief and will end in the shortest time.</p>\n\n<p>But it\u2019s somehow forgotten that the armed formations of the Afghan opposition in the conflict of 1979-1989 didn\u2019t have a single aircraft or combat helicopter. And the war in that country stretched out for a full 10 years. Chechen fighters didn\u2019t have a single airplane. And the fight with them continued several years and cost federal forces a great deal of blood and victims.</p>\n\n<p>And the Armed Forces of Ukraine have some combat aviation. As well as air defense means.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, Ukrainian crews of surface-to-air missile troops (scarcely Georgian) substantially stung the Russian VVS<sup>[7]</sup> in the course of the 2008 conflict<sup>[8].</sup> After the first day of combat operations the Russian VVS leadership was obviously shocked by the losses sustained. And it wouldn\u2019t do to forget about this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As a former officer in air defence, Khodarenok knows well the danger of SAM systems in the modern battlefield and the VVS&#39; shortcomings in the fields of SEAD/DEAD. </p>\n\n<p>(cont)</p>\n</div>",

The closest thing to this happening again may be the VDV assault on Hostomel since they never reached Kyiv proper in numbers.\n\n>It also pays to remember that Stalin\u2019s powerful NKVD and the multimillion-man Soviet Army struggled with the nationalist underground in Western Ukraine for more than 10 years. And now there is a possibility that all of Ukraine could simply turn into partisans. Additionally these formations could easily begin to operate on Russia\u2019s territory.\n\nWe have definitely seen some partisan activity for example in Melitopol.\n\n>Armed struggle in large Ukrainian cities is generally poorly suited to forecasting. It\u2019s commonly known that a big city is the best battlefield for the weak and less well-equipped side of an armed conflict.\n\n>Serious experts note that in a megapolis it\u2019s possible not only to concentrate a grouping in the thousands and even tens of thousands of fighters, but also to protect it from the enemy\u2019s superior fire power.

But in Ukraine there are more than enough big cities, including ones with a million in population. So the Russian Army could meet far from a single Stalingrad or Groznyy in the course of a hypothetical war with Ukraine.\n\nThe Russian military have for the most part tried to avoid urban combat by bypassing cities/larger villages.

Fuel cell manufacturers from Denmark and timber producers from Austria. Private equity titans from New York and concrete plant operators from Germany. Thousands of businesses around the globe are positioning themselves for a possible multibillion-dollar gold rush: the reconstruction of Ukraine once the war is over.\n\n> Russia is stepping up its offensive heading into the second year of the war, but already the staggering rebuilding task is evident. Hundreds of thousands of homes, schools, hospitals and factories have been obliterated along with critical energy facilities and miles of roads, rail tracks and seaports.\n\n> The profound human tragedy is unavoidably also a huge economic opportunity that Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, has likened to the Marshall Plan, the U.S. program that provided aid to Western Europe after World War II. Early cost estimates of rebuilding the physical infrastructure range from $138 billion to $750 billion.\n\n> The prospect of that trove is inspiring altruistic impulses and entrepreneurial vision, savvy business strategizing and rank opportunism for what the Ukrainian chamber of commerce is trumpeting as ''the world's largest construction site!''\n\n> Mr. Zelensky and his allies want to use the rebuilding to stitch Ukraine's infrastructure seamlessly into the rest of Europe.\n\n> Yet whether all the gold in the much-anticipated gold rush will materialize is far from certain. Ukraine, whose economy shrank 30 percent last year, desperately needs funds just to keep going and to make emergency repairs. Long-term reconstruction aid will depend not only on the outcome of the war, but on how much money the European Union, the United States and other allies put up.\n\n> And though private investors are being courted, few are willing to risk committing money now, as the conflict is entrenched.\n\n> Ukraine and several European nations are pushing hard to confiscate frozen Russian assets held abroad, but several skeptics, including officials in the Biden administration, have questioned the legality of such a move.\n\n> Nonetheless, ''a lot of companies are starting to position themselves to be ready and have some track record for this time when the reconstruction funding will be coming in,'' said Tymofiy Mylovanov, a former economy minister who is president of the Kyiv School of Economics. ''There will be a lot of funding from all over the world,'' he said, and business are saying that ''we want to be a part of it.''\n\n> More than 300 companies from 22 countries signed up for a Rebuild Ukraine trade exhibition and conference this week in Warsaw. The gathering is just the latest in a dizzying series of in-person and virtual meetings. Last month, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, a standing-room-only crowd packed Ukraine House to discuss investment opportunities.\n\n> More than 700 French companies swarmed to a conference organized in December by President Emmanuel Macron. And on Wednesday, the Finnish Confederation of Industries sponsored an all-day webinar with Ukrainian officials so companies could show off their wastewater treatment plants, transformers, threshers and prefabricated housing.\n\n> ''There's so many initiatives, it's hard to know who's doing what,'' said Sergiy Tsivkach, the executive director of UkraineInvest, the government office dedicated to attracting foreign investment.\n\n> Mr. Tsivkach sipped a beer a couple of blocks from Lviv's central square. He is glad for the interest but emphasized a crucial point.\n\n> ''They all say, 'We want to help in rebuilding Ukraine,''' he said. ''But do you want to invest your own money, or do you want to sell services or goods? These are two different things.''\n\n> Most are interested in selling something, he said.\n\n> For businesses, a crucial issue is who will control the money. This is a question that Europe, the United States and global institutions like the World Bank -- the biggest donors and lenders -- are vigorously debating.\n\n> ''Who will pay for what?'' Domenico Campogrande, director general of the European Construction Industry Federation, said while moderating a panel at the Warsaw conference.\n\n> Representatives from both Ukrainian and foreign companies were more pointed: Who will decide on the contracts, and how do they apply?\n\n> ''Hundreds of companies have been asking me this,'' said Tomas Kopecny, the Czech government's envoy for Ukraine.\n\n> Ukraine has made clear there will be rewards for early investors when it comes to postwar reconstruction. But that opportunity carries risk.\n\n> Danfoss, a Danish industrial company that sells heat-efficiency devices and hydraulic power units for apartment and other buildings, has been doing business in Ukraine since 1997. When the war started last February, Russian shelling destroyed its Kyiv warehouse.\n\n> Danfoss has since focused on helping with immediate needs in war-torn regions and in western Ukraine, where millions of people displaced from their homes have been forced to settle in temporary shelters.\n\n> ''For now, all efforts are going toward maintaining a survival mode,'' said Andriy Berestyan, the company's managing director in Ukraine. ''Right now, nobody is really looking for major reconstruction.''\n\n> Things had been going better for the company since last summer as Ukraine pushed back Russian advances. By October, new orders for Danfoss's products were rolling in, and Mr. Berestyan restored Danfoss's distribution center in Kyiv. Then Russia started dropping bombs en masse. Power and water were widely cut off, forcing Ukraine -- and businesses -- to swing back to dealing with emergencies.\n\n> Even so, he said, Danfoss is keeping its eye on the long term. ''Definitely there will be rebuilding opportunities,'' he said, ''and we see a huge, huge opportunity for ourselves and for similar companies.''\n\n> That groundwork is being laid in places like Mykolaiv, one of the hardest-hit regions, where numerous Danish companies have been working. Drones operated by Danish companies have mapped every bombed-out structure, with an eye toward using the data to help decide what reconstruction contracts should be issued.\n\n> The information would help companies like Danfoss evaluate the potential for business, and eventually bid on contracts.\n\n> Other governments that are expected to contribute to Ukraine's reconstruction are also offering financial support for domestic firms.\n\n> Germany announced the creation of a fund to guarantee investments. The plan will be overseen by the global auditing giant PwC and would compensate investors for potential financial losses if businesses were expropriated or projects were disrupted.\n\n> France will also offer state guarantees to companies doing future work in Ukraine. Bruno Le Maire, the finance minister, said contracts worth a total of 100 million euros, or $107 million, had been awarded to three French companies for projects in Ukraine: Mati\u00e8re will build 30 floating bridges, and Mas Seeds and Lidea are providing seeds for farmers.\n\n> Private equity firms, too, have an eye on business opportunities. President Zelensky sealed a deal late last year with Laurence D. Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock, to ''coordinate investment efforts to rebuild the war-torn nation.'' BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, will advise Kyiv on ''how to structure the country's reconstruction funds.'' The work will be done on a pro bono basis, but promises to give BlackRock insights into investors' interests.\n\n> Mr. Fink was brought into the effort by Andrew Forrest, a gregarious Australian mining magnate who is the chief executive of Fortescue Metals Group. Mr. Forrest announced a $500 million initial investment in November, from his own private equity fund, into a new pot of money created for rebuilding projects in Ukraine. The fund would be run with BlackRock and aims to raise at least $25 billion from sovereign wealth funds controlled by national governments and private investors from around the world for clean energy investments in war-torn areas.\n\n> Mr. Forrest has courted Mr. Zelensky, wearing a Ukrainian flag pin in his lapel and presenting the Ukraine president with an Australian bullwhip during a visit to Kyiv last year. But in a sign of how cautious investors remain, Mr. Forrest said capital would be made available ''the instant that the Russian forces have been removed from the homelands of Ukraine'' -- but not before.",

There has to be justice in The Hague and there has to be proper reparation in the rebuilding of Ukraine,\u201d he said.\n> \n> Speaking after his conversation with Zelenskiy, Starmer said it was a \u201cconstructive meeting\u201d that had touched on the new military support Ukraine needs, as Kyiv continues to urge western leaders to give it fighter jets.\n> \n> \u201cWe spoke about the need for that justice to cover both the use of Russian state assets for reconstruction and the need for there to be prosecutions for war crimes,\u201d Starmer said.\n> \n> \u201cI was able to tell him that should there be a change of government when we have a general election here, the support for Ukraine will remain the same. It\u2019s a very important message for me to be able to relay to the president face-to-face, and I\u2019ve been able to do that this afternoon.\u201d\n> \n> Starmer said Zelenskiy was very concerned about whether Labour would continue support through weapons and training. \u201cI stressed that the Labour party supports and would maintain the defence, training, and technological support the current UK government is providing,\u201d he said.\n> \n> \u201cI\u2019ve said throughout this conflict there will be no difference between the political parties on this, so we will continue to work with the government to see what further support we can provide.\u201d\n> \n> Starmer is keen to portray himself to the Ukrainians as a reliable partner and strong supporter. At prime minister\u2019s questions during Zelenskiy\u2019s visit to London this month, he used all his time at the dispatch box to stress cross-party unity on Ukraine, rather than challenging Rishi Sunak.\n> \n> He said Labour \u201cdoesn\u2019t just hope for Ukrainian victory, we believe in it\u201d and highlighted his time as a barrister representing victims of Serbian aggression at the international court of justice in The Hague. \u201cWe in this house have a duty to stand on the shoulders of giants and support Ukraine\u2019s fight for freedom, liberty and victory,\u201d Starmer said.",

Photographs of civilians in the outskirts of Kyiv blindfolded, with their arms tied behind their back,\u201d Starmer told Reuters.</p>\n\n<p>He said he had travelled to Ukraine to express solidarity with the country and to emphasise the need to pursue justice and reparations against perpetrators. \u201cThere has to be justice for this. There has to be justice in The Hague and there has to be proper reparation in the rebuilding of Ukraine,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking after his conversation with Zelenskiy, Starmer said it was a \u201cconstructive meeting\u201d that had touched on the new military support Ukraine needs, as Kyiv continues to urge western leaders to give it fighter jets.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe spoke about the need for that justice to cover both the use of Russian state assets for reconstruction and the need for there to be prosecutions for war crimes,\u201d Starmer said.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI was able to tell him that should there be a change of government when we have a general election here, the support for Ukraine will remain the same. It\u2019s a very important message for me to be able to relay to the president face-to-face, and I\u2019ve been able to do that this afternoon.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Starmer said Zelenskiy was very concerned about whether Labour would continue support through weapons and training. \u201cI stressed that the Labour party supports and would maintain the defence, training, and technological support the current UK government is providing,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve said throughout this conflict there will be no difference between the political parties on this, so we will continue to work with the government to see what further support we can provide.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Starmer is keen to portray himself to the Ukrainians as a reliable partner and strong supporter. At prime minister\u2019s questions during Zelenskiy\u2019s visit to London this month, he used all his time at the dispatch box to stress cross-party unity on Ukraine, rather than challenging Rishi Sunak.</p>\n\n<p>He said Labour \u201cdoesn\u2019t just hope for Ukrainian victory, we believe in it\u201d and highlighted his time as a barrister representing victims of Serbian aggression at the international court of justice in The Hague. \u201cWe in this house have a duty to stand on the shoulders of giants and support Ukraine\u2019s fight for freedom, liberty and victory,\u201d Starmer said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

                        "body": "> At this point it's hard to distinguish between what is genuine leftwing criticism of NATO nations, and what is astroturf Russian agitation.\n\nPersonally I'm not 'anti nato' per se, but I'm highly critical of NATO's broader policies and strategy. In its current state i think it actively encourages conflict... just not between NATO countries themselves. I would have no problem with a genuinely 'defensive alliance' that was purely about keeping the peace, but that isn't possible when it's actually an ideological project of sorts and has its own pseudo foreign policy. \n\nA military alliance doesn't need its own sphere of influence. It doesn't need to unilaterally intervene in external conflicts. That they actively boast about the illegal intervention in Libya on their website is mind boggling.\n\nAnd a consensus based organisation that doesn't seek expansion as a matter of policy doesn't need to declare that it WILL be adding other countries to it. It doesn't publicly condemn a member for not just agreeing to the accession of new countries (even if this sort of thing is complicated). \n\nEven now the thinking is all about short term interests, expansion and absorbing new strategic countries despite the rhetoric pretending it isn't. NATO pretends to be a benign, passive bystander, but it's ludicrous.\n\nThe problem of course is that the wider public themselves refuse to admit what NATO is and just repeat the same lines as NATO's press secretary, so if you make these perfectly valid criticisms you just get dismissed as some deranged leftist (which i'm very much not)\n\n> I used to feel like leftist spaces only criticized the US, and other nations, simply because the US was the most active on the international scene (and activity usually means doing something bad, because governments tend to be pretty amoral).\n\nWell I'm demonstrably critical of the US (as should everyone else be IMO), but it strikes me that americans feel it's all just base anti-americanism.... it isn't. Part of it is that by it's sheer size and influence it's always going to be more discussed.\n\nI'll put it this way. In the post ww2 era before we brits realised it wasnt 1890 any more, we engaged in a lot of the stuff that the US is now criticised for then and now. We acted around the world with impunity, considering ourselves above the law. We acted with pure hypocrisy, we abused our position of power (especially obvious in the middle east up until the 60s/70s). I criticise the brits for the exact same romanticised, mythologised interpretation of naitonal behaviour as i do the americans. And we still engage in it to an extent, albeit very limited.\n\nThe difference is this. We mostly did that in a very different age when imperialism was the norm, when colonies were everywhere, where the west controlling the world was 'accepted'. Those days have been (rhetorically) gone for decades now. Putin's 'special military operation' comes from the exact same line of thinking that dominates our own perceptions of the modern world where we realise that these things are wrong, but still feel compelled to do them anyway.. 'This is just a special operation to liberate the iraqis', 'don't worry this is just a humanitarian intervention', 'we're fighting for democracy'. I've actually got a lot of respect for Bush Sr for stopping at the Iraqi border in 91 and clearly and cleanly fulfilling his UNSC resolution mandate to liberate kuwait. Of course this was so out of character that it led to 'the blob' (as it were) concocting a story to 'finish what we should've done in 91'. They couldn't let the injustice of conforming to the system stand.\n\n91 was a perfect example of how foreign policy and 'world leadership' should work. Multilateralism, leadership, the rule of law. And that's what makes it so unique and made so many people deeply uncomfortable. \n\nDon't take this the wrong way, but the US is relatively isolated, parochial and self-centred. And yet it also tries to dictate how things should work all over the world from this position of relative ignorance. Foreign policy is generally decided by an incestuous collection of US-centred think tanks and pressure groups within the 'beltway' and is dominated by military interests over diplomatic ones (the only time the diplomatic corps funding bill has passed congress in the past 20 years is when it was rolled into the defence budget bill). \n\nAmerican policymakers care about what the american people care about and the american people on the whole don't know much about the rest of the world (in part again due to the dominance of US media). Congress can pass the most egregious of legislation that imposes diktats on the rest of the world without giving it a second thought, because the rest of the world *doesn't matter* (and that includes allies). Nobody cares that the caeser act (which is illegal under international law) means it's impossible for humanitarian groups to help in Syria, that hospitals can't get essential medical equipment, that people can't access water except for a few hours every few days and that they're suffering horrendously. Syrians are disposable. What actually matters is that the US govt can pretend it's trying to help the syrian people by passing the ceasar act. It's not unique. Not to mention that the (again illegal) US occupation of northern syria is contributing to the mass suffering of innocent civilians but all anyone cares about is whether there are iranian troops nearby or not.\n\nIt's possible to act in your own self interest without imposing your own nonsense on the rest of the world without a second though I guess would sum up my point. I grew up in the middle east. My mum cooked christmas dinner for US servicemen during the gulf war. I've seen both sides of the coin of positive and negative western influence. I know people who were in baghdad when the invasion began, but i've also witnessed the wonders of engagement and exchange and the prosperity that can bring to the developing world when magically we stop playing stupid political games and work towards mutual goals. \n\nI have absolutely no problem with the US being top dog, I just want them to follow the very rules they profess to uphold. I'm a liberal internationalist, but i've come to realise the damage that we are doing to our own system through our continued foreign policy actions (including destroying it domestically). I've lived in 6 countries from nordic democracies to absolute monarchies and the only lesson i've learnt is that we foment the perception of difference when on the whole we're not very different all.\n\nIt's not about 'leftism' or 'russia', it's about valid criticisms, actually holding principles (rather than pretending to) and seeking the general betterment of humanity.\n\nAnyway. That's how i see it as someone that is regularly dismissed as a 'russian propagandist' or 'leftist'.",
                        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>At this point it&#39;s hard to distinguish between what is genuine leftwing criticism of NATO nations, and what is astroturf Russian agitation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Personally I&#39;m not &#39;anti nato&#39; per se, but I&#39;m highly critical of NATO&#39;s broader policies and strategy. In its current state i think it actively encourages conflict... just not between NATO countries themselves. I would have no problem with a genuinely &#39;defensive alliance&#39; that was purely about keeping the peace, but that isn&#39;t possible when it&#39;s actually an ideological project of sorts and has its own pseudo foreign policy. </p>\n\n<p>A military alliance doesn&#39;t need its own sphere of influence. It doesn&#39;t need to unilaterally intervene in external conflicts. That they actively boast about the illegal intervention in Libya on their website is mind boggling.</p>\n\n<p>And a consensus based organisation that doesn&#39;t seek expansion as a matter of policy doesn&#39;t need to declare that it WILL be adding other countries to it. It doesn&#39;t publicly condemn a member for not just agreeing to the accession of new countries (even if this sort of thing is complicated). </p>\n\n<p>Even now the thinking is all about short term interests, expansion and absorbing new strategic countries despite the rhetoric pretending it isn&#39;t. NATO pretends to be a benign, passive bystander, but it&#39;s ludicrous.</p>\n\n<p>The problem of course is that the wider public themselves refuse to admit what NATO is and just repeat the same lines as NATO&#39;s press secretary, so if you make these perfectly valid criticisms you just get dismissed as some deranged leftist (which i&#39;m very much not)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I used to feel like leftist spaces only criticized the US, and other nations, simply because the US was the most active on the international scene (and activity usually means doing something bad, because governments tend to be pretty amoral).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Well I&#39;m demonstrably critical of the US (as should everyone else be IMO), but it strikes me that americans feel it&#39;s all just base anti-americanism.... it isn&#39;t. Part of it is that by it&#39;s sheer size and influence it&#39;s always going to be more discussed.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll put it this way. In the post ww2 era before we brits realised it wasnt 1890 any more, we engaged in a lot of the stuff that the US is now criticised for then and now. We acted around the world with impunity, considering ourselves above the law. We acted with pure hypocrisy, we abused our position of power (especially obvious in the middle east up until the 60s/70s). I criticise the brits for the exact same romanticised, mythologised interpretation of naitonal behaviour as i do the americans. And we still engage in it to an extent, albeit very limited.</p>\n\n<p>The difference is this. We mostly did that in a very different age when imperialism was the norm, when colonies were everywhere, where the west controlling the world was &#39;accepted&#39;. Those days have been (rhetorically) gone for decades now. Putin&#39;s &#39;special military operation&#39; comes from the exact same line of thinking that dominates our own perceptions of the modern world where we realise that these things are wrong, but still feel compelled to do them anyway.. &#39;This is just a special operation to liberate the iraqis&#39;, &#39;don&#39;t worry this is just a humanitarian intervention&#39;, &#39;we&#39;re fighting for democracy&#39;. I&#39;ve actually got a lot of respect for Bush Sr for stopping at the Iraqi border in 91 and clearly and cleanly fulfilling his UNSC resolution mandate to liberate kuwait. Of course this was so out of character that it led to &#39;the blob&#39; (as it were) concocting a story to &#39;finish what we should&#39;ve done in 91&#39;. They couldn&#39;t let the injustice of conforming to the system stand.</p>\n\n<p>91 was a perfect example of how foreign policy and &#39;world leadership&#39; should work. Multilateralism, leadership, the rule of law. And that&#39;s what makes it so unique and made so many people deeply uncomfortable. </p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t take this the wrong way, but the US is relatively isolated, parochial and self-centred. And yet it also tries to dictate how things should work all over the world from this position of relative ignorance. Foreign policy is generally decided by an incestuous collection of US-centred think tanks and pressure groups within the &#39;beltway&#39; and is dominated by military interests over diplomatic ones (the only time the diplomatic corps funding bill has passed congress in the past 20 years is when it was rolled into the defence budget bill). </p>\n\n<p>American policymakers care about what the american people care about and the american people on the whole don&#39;t know much about the rest of the world (in part again due to the dominance of US media). Congress can pass the most egregious of legislation that imposes diktats on the rest of the world without giving it a second thought, because the rest of the world <em>doesn&#39;t matter</em> (and that includes allies). Nobody cares that the caeser act (which is illegal under international law) means it&#39;s impossible for humanitarian groups to help in Syria, that hospitals can&#39;t get essential medical equipment, that people can&#39;t access water except for a few hours every few days and that they&#39;re suffering horrendously.

        "body": ">[\u2019Intensity has gone up\u2019: Inside the US\u2019s plan to arm Ukraine](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/17/politics/us-weapons-factories-ukraine-ammunition/index.html)\n\n>Inside a sprawling factory just off the President Biden Expressway in downtown Scranton, Pennsylvania, the future arsenal of Ukraine\u2019s war effort is being forged, one red hot artillery shell at a time.\n\n>Running full-tilt, as it was on a recent January morning, the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant churns out roughly 11,000 artillery shells a month. That may seem like a lot, but the Ukrainian military often fires that many shells over just a few days.\n\n>To meet that demand, the Scranton plant is undergoing a massive expansion, fueled by millions of dollars in new defense spending from the Pentagon. It\u2019s investing in new high-tech machinery, hiring a few dozen additional workers and will eventually shift to a 24/7 schedule of constant production.\n\n>\u201cIt\u2019s certainly ramped up over the last year. As we bring in more modern equipment, it\u2019ll be able to ramp up even further,\u201d said Todd Smith, senior director of General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems, which operates the plant for the Army.\n\n>\u201cIntensity has gone up,\u201d Smith added. \u201cLet\u2019s just put it that way.\u201d\n\n>The US and its allies have already sent nearly $50 billion in aid and equipment to Ukraine\u2019s military over the past year. To keep that up, and to rebuild its own stockpiles, the Pentagon is racing to re-arm, embarking on the biggest increase in ammunition production in decades, and putting portions of the US defense industry on a war-footing despite America technically not being at war.\n\n>The Pentagon has allocated roughly $3 billion alone to buy munitions overseas from allies and to ramp up production at home. Some of that money will go toward producing what has become a staple of the war \u2013 155 millimeter artillery shells.\n\n>The Army is planning a 500% increase in artillery shell production, from 15,000 a month to 70,000, according to Army acquisition chief Doug Bush. Much of that increase will be fulfilled by the Scranton plant, which makes a large share of the country\u2019s supply of artillery shells.\n\n>Across the US, munitions factories are increasing production as fast as possible. A Lockheed Martin plant in Camden, Arkansas, is cranking out a series of rockets and missiles, including those used by the Army\u2019s Patriot missile system \u2013 all of which are in high demand in Ukraine. Bush told reporters in January that the Army was standing up a new plant in Garland, Texas to make artillery shells, while an existing plant is being expanded in Middletown, Iowa that loads, packs and assembles 155 millimeter shells.\n\n>Bush told CNN the Army intends to double the production of Javelin anti-tank missiles, make roughly 33% more Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (GMLRS) surface-to-surface medium-range missiles a year, and produce each month a minimum of 60 Stinger anti-aircraft missiles \u2013 which were \u201calmost not in production at all,\u201d according to Bush.\n\n>Stinger and Javelin missiles are some of the most critical and relied-upon munitions by Ukraine to thwart Russian ground advances and aerial assaults, who previously told the US that it needs 500 of each every day.\n\n>\u201cWe realized we had to really put our foot all the way to the floor,\u201d said Bush.\n\n>>A race against time\n\n> As the war in Ukraine stretches into its second year, the US and its allies face an acute problem \u2013 Ukraine is burning through ammunition faster than the US and NATO can produce them.\n\n>The topic of dwindling munitions supplies was front and center during a crucial meeting in Brussels this week. Members of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, an alliance of 54 countries supporting the defense of Ukraine, talked head on about the challenges of continuing to keep Ukraine\u2019s military well-supplied.\n\n>NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Monday that the \u201ccurrent rate of Ukraine\u2019s ammunition expenditure is many times higher than our current rate of production,\u201d which is putting \u201cour defense industries under strain.\u201d\n\n>Much of that strain is being shouldered by American defense contractors. But even as the US embarks on an historic effort to re-arm, there are questions about whether it\u2019ll be enough. As Ukraine prepares for a much-anticipated spring offensive in the coming weeks, the US is still years away from reaching its expected level of increased weapons production.\n\n>\u201cThe war hinges heavily on defense industrial production, and these are critical investments that the US and ultimately Ukraine will benefit from, but the question is, were they made too late to affect what could be the decisive phases of the conflict this year,\u201d said Michael Kofman, director of Russia Studies at the Center for Naval Analyses, a national security research non-profit.\n\n>\u201cFor Ukraine, the challenges are more immediate and medium term, while much of the added US production capacity appears to be two years in the future,\u201d said Kofman.\n\n>Indeed, according to Bush, it will take anywhere from 12 to 18 months for the US to reach its \u201cmax\u201d production rate of 70,00 artillery shells a month.\n\n>>Replenishing US stockpiles\n\n>In addition to ensuring Ukrainian troops have the equipment they need, the US also has to keep up with orders of more equipment from allies \u2013 which have only been increasing.\n\n>\u201cMany allies in Europe right now are increasing their orders for US military equipment as a result of the war, so that\u2019s adding to demand for our production,\u201d said Bush. Ukraine\u2019s need \u201cchanges month to month,\u201d he added, making it less predictable than foreign military sales which are typically known well in advance.\n\n>On top of that, the US has a lot of work to do in rebuilding its own stockpiles, which the war in Ukraine has left dangerously low in the eyes of some experts.\n\n>A recent report authored by Seth Jones, the director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies\u2019 International Security Program, warns that America\u2019s assistance to Ukraine has \u201cdepleted US stocks of some types of weapon systems and munitions, such as Stinger surface-to-air missiles, 155mm howitzers and ammunition, and Javelin anti-tank missile systems.\u201d\n\n>Jones also told CNN that CSIS war games showed in a Pacific conflict, the US runs out of \u201ckey long range munitions,\u201d like long-range anti-ship missiles, in \u201cless than a week of the war.\u201d\n\n>\u201cIf our whole strategy right now, especially in the Pacific, is deterrence, we want to deter conflict \u2013 a key part of deterrence is that you have the weapon systems and you have enough of them pre-positioned in key locations so that any actor who is considering the aggressive use of force knows that we mean business and we have those systems in place to use and we\u2019ve got enough of them to use in a protracted conflict,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThat\u2019s not where we\u2019re at right now.\u201d\n\n>The Pentagon is working to speed things up as best it can. Part of that effort involves changing the way it structures work order for the country\u2019s large defense contractors. The military often works off year-to-year contracts, which makes it difficult for industry partners to plan ahead with production and their workforce in order to meet the needs the military lays out for them.\n\n>\u201cNo defense company in their right mind is going to start producing munitions if by the end of every fiscal year, the Marine Corps, the Navy, the Air Force takes what it had allotted in budget and moves it to a different pet platform or program,\u201d said Jones of CSIS.\n\n>Bush said the Defense Department is looking at longer-term contracts, which he agreed would provide \u201ca more efficient supplier base.\u201d A seven-year contract, for example, allows industry to plan its workforce and production long-term instead of working year to year, he said. And building out that workforce will be critical as more plants and more shifts could ultimately mean more jobs\n\n>>\u2018The arsenal of democracy\u2019\n\n>In Brussels this week, top US defense officials struck an optimistic tone about being able to deliver Ukraine what it needs.\n\n>\u201cWith unity and urgency, we will again deliver the support that we have promised to Ukraine,\u201d Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said. \u201cWe will put capabilities into the hands of trained Ukrainian forces so that they can be integrated together on the battlefield.\u201d\n\n>America\u2019s top general, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley echoed the same sentiment in a press conference on Tuesday, saying the international community \u201cwill continue to support Ukraine\u201d until Russian President Vladimir Putin \u201cends his war of choice.\u201d\n\n>But back home, there are questions about how sustainable the US commitment to Ukraine truly is. A poll published in December found that support for US aid to Ukraine was declining among Republicans, and there were concerns that a Republican-led Congress could lead to a drop in material support for Ukraine at a time when the rate of weapons production could make all the difference on the battlefield.\n\n>Last week, Republican Rep.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/17/politics/us-weapons-factories-ukraine-ammunition/index.html\">\u2019Intensity has gone up\u2019: Inside the US\u2019s plan to arm Ukraine</a></p>\n\n<p>Inside a sprawling factory just off the President Biden Expressway in downtown Scranton, Pennsylvania, the future arsenal of Ukraine\u2019s war effort is being forged, one red hot artillery shell at a time.</p>\n\n<p>Running full-tilt, as it was on a recent January morning, the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant churns out roughly 11,000 artillery shells a month. That may seem like a lot, but the Ukrainian military often fires that many shells over just a few days.</p>\n\n<p>To meet that demand, the Scranton plant is undergoing a massive expansion, fueled by millions of dollars in new defense spending from the Pentagon. It\u2019s investing in new high-tech machinery, hiring a few dozen additional workers and will eventually shift to a 24/7 schedule of constant production.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s certainly ramped up over the last year. As we bring in more modern equipment, it\u2019ll be able to ramp up even further,\u201d said Todd Smith, senior director of General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems, which operates the plant for the Army.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIntensity has gone up,\u201d Smith added. \u201cLet\u2019s just put it that way.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The US and its allies have already sent nearly $50 billion in aid and equipment to Ukraine\u2019s military over the past year. To keep that up, and to rebuild its own stockpiles, the Pentagon is racing to re-arm, embarking on the biggest increase in ammunition production in decades, and putting portions of the US defense industry on a war-footing despite America technically not being at war.</p>\n\n<p>The Pentagon has allocated roughly $3 billion alone to buy munitions overseas from allies and to ramp up production at home. Some of that money will go toward producing what has become a staple of the war \u2013 155 millimeter artillery shells.</p>\n\n<p>The Army is planning a 500% increase in artillery shell production, from 15,000 a month to 70,000, according to Army acquisition chief Doug Bush. Much of that increase will be fulfilled by the Scranton plant, which makes a large share of the country\u2019s supply of artillery shells.</p>\n\n<p>Across the US, munitions factories are increasing production as fast as possible. A Lockheed Martin plant in Camden, Arkansas, is cranking out a series of rockets and missiles, including those used by the Army\u2019s Patriot missile system \u2013 all of which are in high demand in Ukraine. Bush told reporters in January that the Army was standing up a new plant in Garland, Texas to make artillery shells, while an existing plant is being expanded in Middletown, Iowa that loads, packs and assembles 155 millimeter shells.</p>\n\n<p>Bush told CNN the Army intends to double the production of Javelin anti-tank missiles, make roughly 33% more Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (GMLRS) surface-to-surface medium-range missiles a year, and produce each month a minimum of 60 Stinger anti-aircraft missiles \u2013 which were \u201calmost not in production at all,\u201d according to Bush.</p>\n\n<p>Stinger and Javelin missiles are some of the most critical and relied-upon munitions by Ukraine to thwart Russian ground advances and aerial assaults, who previously told the US that it needs 500 of each every day.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe realized we had to really put our foot all the way to the floor,\u201d said Bush.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>A race against time</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As the war in Ukraine stretches into its second year, the US and its allies face an acute problem \u2013 Ukraine is burning through ammunition faster than the US and NATO can produce them.</p>\n\n<p>The topic of dwindling munitions supplies was front and center during a crucial meeting in Brussels this week. Members of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, an alliance of 54 countries supporting the defense of Ukraine, talked head on about the challenges of continuing to keep Ukraine\u2019s military well-supplied.</p>\n\n<p>NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Monday that the \u201ccurrent rate of Ukraine\u2019s ammunition expenditure is many times higher than our current rate of production,\u201d which is putting \u201cour defense industries under strain.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Much of that strain is being shouldered by American defense contractors. But even as the US embarks on an historic effort to re-arm, there are questions about whether it\u2019ll be enough. As Ukraine prepares for a much-anticipated spring offensive in the coming weeks, the US is still years away from reaching its expected level of increased weapons production.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe war hinges heavily on defense industrial production, and these are critical investments that the US and ultimately Ukraine will benefit from, but the question is, were they made too late to affect what could be the decisive phases of the conflict this year,\u201d said Michael Kofman, director of Russia Studies at the Center for Naval Analyses, a national security research non-profit.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cFor Ukraine, the challenges are more immediate and medium term, while much of the added US production capacity appears to be two years in the future,\u201d said Kofman.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, according to Bush, it will take anywhere from 12 to 18 months for the US to reach its \u201cmax\u201d production rate of 70,00 artillery shells a month.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Replenishing US stockpiles</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In addition to ensuring Ukrainian troops have the equipment they need, the US also has to keep up with orders of more equipment from allies \u2013 which have only been increasing.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMany allies in Europe right now are increasing their orders for US military equipment as a result of the war, so that\u2019s adding to demand for our production,\u201d said Bush. Ukraine\u2019s need \u201cchanges month to month,\u201d he added, making it less predictable than foreign military sales which are typically known well in advance.</p>\n\n<p>On top of that, the US has a lot of work to do in rebuilding its own stockpiles, which the war in Ukraine has left dangerously low in the eyes of some experts.</p>\n\n<p>A recent report authored by Seth Jones, the director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies\u2019 International Security Program, warns that America\u2019s assistance to Ukraine has \u201cdepleted US stocks of some types of weapon systems and munitions, such as Stinger surface-to-air missiles, 155mm howitzers and ammunition, and Javelin anti-tank missile systems.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Jones also told CNN that CSIS war games showed in a Pacific conflict, the US runs out of \u201ckey long range munitions,\u201d like long-range anti-ship missiles, in \u201cless than a week of the war.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf our whole strategy right now, especially in the Pacific, is deterrence, we want to deter conflict \u2013 a key part of deterrence is that you have the weapon systems and you have enough of them pre-positioned in key locations so that any actor who is considering the aggressive use of force knows that we mean business and we have those systems in place to use and we\u2019ve got enough of them to use in a protracted conflict,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThat\u2019s not where we\u2019re at right now.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The Pentagon is working to speed things up as best it can. Part of that effort involves changing the way it structures work order for the country\u2019s large defense contractors. The military often works off year-to-year contracts, which makes it difficult for industry partners to plan ahead with production and their workforce in order to meet the needs the military lays out for them.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo defense company in their right mind is going to start producing munitions if by the end of every fiscal year, the Marine Corps, the Navy, the Air Force takes what it had allotted in budget and moves it to a different pet platform or program,\u201d said Jones of CSIS.</p>\n\n<p>Bush said the Defense Department is looking at longer-term contracts, which he agreed would provide \u201ca more efficient supplier base.\u201d A seven-year contract, for example, allows industry to plan its workforce and production long-term instead of working year to year, he said. And building out that workforce will be critical as more plants and more shifts could ultimately mean more jobs</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u2018The arsenal of democracy\u2019</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In Brussels this week, top US defense officials struck an optimistic tone about being able to deliver Ukraine what it needs.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWith unity and urgency, we will again deliver the support that we have promised to Ukraine,\u201d Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said. \u201cWe will put capabilities into the hands of trained Ukrainian forces so that they can be integrated together on the battlefield.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>America\u2019s top general, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley echoed the same sentiment in a press conference on Tuesday, saying the international community \u201cwill continue to support Ukraine\u201d until Russian President Vladimir Putin \u201cends his war of choice.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>But back home, there are questions about how sustainable the US commitment to Ukraine truly is. A poll published in December found that support for US aid to Ukraine was declining among Republicans, and there were concerns that a Republican-led Congress could lead to a drop in material support for Ukraine at a time when the rate of weapons production could make all the difference on the battlefield.</p>\n\n<p>Last week, Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz introduced a bill to end US support for Ukraine, a measure supported by a handful of far-right lawmakers including Lauren Boebert, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar. GOP sources, however, have told CNN that it\u2019s only a small group of Republican lawmakers who are against funding aid to Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>And though then-House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy suggested in October that Republicans could slow funding for Ukraine if they took majority control, sources said he has since walked back his comments privately to reassure senior defense hawks in the House.</p>\n\n<p>If all goes according to plan, in a year production rates in the US will be much higher than they are now, Bush said. And while the hope is that the conflict in Ukraine is over long before then, Bush is confident the US military and industrial base would be ready for whatever comes next.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe are still the arsenal of democracy,\u201d Bush said. \u201cAnd nobody does it better than the United States.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Their microphones and cameras can record and transmit sounds and images that depict the facts of war or provide tools for propaganda. These records are allowing investigators to build extensive visual archives of the conflict that could eventually provide a reckoning for war crimes.\n\n> They have been deployed to identify military targets with the witting or unwitting involvement of users and to assess damage. They allow ordinary people the means to provide the military with targeting information, blurring the division between civilians and combatants. They are used by the Russian and Ukrainian public to raise funds for uniforms, drones or other military equipment, and by the Ukrainian military to guide drones and bomb targets. They are also used to phone home.\n\n> \"The war is in the palm of your hand, which is astonishing, really, you could be anywhere in the world,\" said Matthew Ford, associate professor at the Swedish Defence University. \"One device becomes the means by which you produce, publish and consume media, but also target the enemy,\" he said.\n\n> The digital documentation provided by smartphones is already overwhelming. Mnemonic, a Berlin-based nonprofit documenting human-rights abuses in Ukraine, said it has collected 2.8 million digital records in less than a year. Over 11 years of war in Syria, the Syrian Archive, a sister organization, has collected and preserved 5 million digital records.\n\n> The devices also have a significant military utility. \"Smartphones are a dream come true for the intelligence people and a nightmare for the counterintelligence people,\" said Eliot Cohen, a military historian and strategist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington\u2014the former because they can help to identify enemy movements, the latter because they can equally expose one's own side.\n\n> Chechen fighters, loyal to strongman leader Ramzan Kadyrov and known for their use of TikTok and Instagram to advertise their exploits, have on several occasions exposed their locations by using cellphones, drawing at least three strikes after Ukraine's military intelligence was able to locate them through their social-media posts, according to a Ukrainian official.\n\n> One incident was at a school building in a rural part of Ukraine's Kherson region during Ukraine's fall offensive there. \"The author of a video filmed his colleagues from different angles as well as the premises and territory of the school where they were located,\" the official said. Hours later, the building was hit with precision artillery. The strike killed around 30 fighters, Chechens said on social media.\n\n> The use of phones on the battlefield is a test of fundamental discipline, said Mr. Cohen. \"A really well-disciplined military will probably never be perfect in preventing people from using mobile phones and things like that. But they'll do a lot better than, say, the Russians.\"\n\n> Smartphones also give the home front a window into the battlefield and open up opportunities for information warfare.\n\n> Platforms such as Facebook, which is blocked in Russia, and VKontakte carry significant war content, but the service where much of the war is playing out on both sides is Telegram, an encrypted app that allows widespread distribution of content with almost no curation.\n\n> \"Over Telegram, there's this unadulterated pouring out of the horrors of war in real time, that we've never ever seen before\u2026without being sanitized, without being censored,\" said Andrew Hoskins, professor of global security at Glasgow University.\n\n> \"On some channels, every image and video, I think, is a breach of the Geneva Conventions,\" which forbid, for example, the distribution of photographs of the war dead and insist on preserving the dignity of prisoners of war.\n\n> Making sense out of this mass of digital material requires \"some human in the loop,\" said Mr. Ford.\n\n> The Ukraine files held by Mnemonic already run into years of digital footage. Investigators from the organization are poring over these records, with the help of computer vision, artificial intelligence and machine learning, tools that they expect will develop further to aid investigations in the future, said Brian Perlman, a Mnemonic investigator.

What they relied on were tried and tested small unit dismounted attacks that were performed constantly and without regard for losses, which is why some could still succeed when others failed, because they could replace the losses and keep repeating the attacks.

Such an offensive would be extremely slow unless they can quickly breach the Russian defensive lines, which they likely can't due to overall lack of skill, high quality offensive equipment, large stockpiles of ammunition, and entirely uncommitted corps (plural) of fully staffed mechanized maneuver brigades waiting in reserve indefinitely.\n\nIf such an offensive is slow it takes a section of the frontage that is relatively straight now and turns it into a salient. For instance, a single operational axis drive to Melitopol (likely two tactical axes) that only makes it halfway to Melitopol turns a frontage only ~25 km long to 100 km long in terms of how much the flanks of the salient increase, all of which will be needed to be defended heavily to withstand Russian counterattacks. Without the ability to punch through defensive belts with the speed to advance faster than the ability for the Russians to react, which means tactical and operational overmatch of a degree the Ukrainians don't possess for enough reasons to fill it's own post, they'll dig themselves into a deeper salient needing more manpower to hold those flanks, while grinding their forces and limited ammo stockpiles down doing frontal assaults.\n\nAn example of what I mean can be seen in the Kharkiv counteroffensive in [Kharkiv counteroffensive](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FcVE8FYXoAEtpHU?format=jpg&name=large), the Ukrainians broke through a relatively short frontage of the front lines and drove to Kupyansk and south to Izyum. They Russians didn't have a defense in depth or reserves, so couldn't counterattack those narrow thrusts going east and south, so they achieved a total tactical and operational breakthrough that turned into maneuver warfare with exploitation and pursuit. However, had the Russians had a defense in depth, after getting through the first lines that assault force would just keep running into second and third and forth positions, plus dealing with counterattacks by the tactical reserves whose only task would be performing those. That offensive would not have worked as performed had the Russians been just a little bit stronger than they were. And now the Russians have largely corrected that problem by increasing manpower in existing units, creating new units, and building stout defenses especially in depth. Those new forces largely suck, but it's not like the UAF are that good either. \n\nThat's why the Ukrainians want ATACMS so badly, they look at it as a Wunderwaffen hoping it would crush Russian logistics and command and control to a degree greater than the July-August HIMARS GMLRS introduction, the ultimate operational force multiplier. It's also why they want western tanks and IFV and similar equipment, hoping it gives them an edge, gaining technical superiority as a tactical force multiplier.",

The key issues affecting the delivery prospects are:\n\n* Low quantities that national armies are willing to release from their inventories\n* Poor condition of tanks in question\n* Lack of sufficient spares and equipment to support the deliveries\n\nSome prospects still remain to be explored, such as willingness of Switzerland to sell it's surplus Leopard 2A4 to backfill European armies already fielding them.  In any case, a key limitation is ability of Rheinmetal/KMW to refurbish tanks which have been stored for considerable amount of time.   Ironically, Leopard 1 - a tank that has been out of almost all European combat inventories for more then a decade - will be available in greater quantities.  Yet while upgraded Leopard 1s offer some capability that UAF did not possess - primarily in the area of high quality optics and communications -  it can no longer be regarded as a front line MBT due to it's light armor.    \n\n\nHow many Abrams tanks US is willing to supply remains unclear.  Based on press reports, the Biden administration regarded supply of Abrams tank as primarily a political decision to trigger Leopard 2 deliveries to Ukraine, as opposed to becoming a major tank supplier in and of itself.  While it's unlikely that the declared 31 units Abrams will be the only delivery of those tanks, the offered delivery timeline (6 months + ) indicates that the additional tanks will not be arriving for quite a while.  \n\n\nThere remains several other potential sources of MBT supply to Ukraine\n\n* Jordanian Challenger 1 tanks (402 delivered, likely significantly less in usable condition)\n* M-60A1/A3.

Difficult. We are holding on to the last,\u201d said the soldier.\n\nHe described a dynamic battlefield where buildings change hands daily and units can\u2019t keep track of the escalating death toll. \u201cNo one will tell you how many dead and wounded there are. Because no one knows for sure. Not a single person,\u201d he said. \u201cNot at the headquarters. Not anywhere. Positions are being taken and re-taken constantly. What was our house today, becomes Wagner's the next day.\u201d\n\nIn Soledar, no one counts the dead,\u201d he added.\nThe soldier said it was unclear as of Tuesday night how much of the town was held by the Russians: \u201cNo one can definitely say who moved where and who holds what, because no one knows for sure. There is a huge grey area in the city that everyone claims to control, [but] it\u2019s just any empty hype.\u201d\n\nThe Ukrainians have lost many troops in Soledar but the ranks are being replenished as the fight for the mining town continues, he said: \u201cThe personnel of our units have been renewed by almost half, more or less.

Difficult. We are holding on to the last,\u201d said the soldier.</p>\n\n<p>He described a dynamic battlefield where buildings change hands daily and units can\u2019t keep track of the escalating death toll. \u201cNo one will tell you how many dead and wounded there are. Because no one knows for sure. Not a single person,\u201d he said. \u201cNot at the headquarters. Not anywhere. Positions are being taken and re-taken constantly. What was our house today, becomes Wagner&#39;s the next day.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In Soledar, no one counts the dead,\u201d he added.\nThe soldier said it was unclear as of Tuesday night how much of the town was held by the Russians: \u201cNo one can definitely say who moved where and who holds what, because no one knows for sure. There is a huge grey area in the city that everyone claims to control, [but] it\u2019s just any empty hype.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The Ukrainians have lost many troops in Soledar but the ranks are being replenished as the fight for the mining town continues, he said: \u201cThe personnel of our units have been renewed by almost half, more or less.

Its not nice colonial war with FOBs and Camp this and that with cafeterias and occasional mortar shell.</p>\n</div>",

Some countries entered into bad projects with bad terms and they ended badly (there's an ongoing legal case against the Kenyan government for the railway project that you can find court reports from) and others the exact opposite.\n\nBut broadly I think it's important to understand a few key points about the entire system of foreign lending.\n\n1. China itself isn't the centralised bohemoth people think. Its a variety of pretty autonomous provinces and departments. Arguably a lot of the problems with BRI come from this decentralisation and the competition it can create (think of how it can play out in weird ways such as during covid lock downs, with some places trying to compete to have the fewest cases etc) \n\n2. BRI isn't really a coherent plan. It's more a vague aspiration that the aforementioned disparate entities 'compete' to try and interpret and implement (as with a lot of Chinese policy initiatives E.g. Common prosperity). Strong lending also predates BRI. Broadly the idea is just 'let's help other countries grow and improve infrastructure so we can all make money' \n\n3.

Some countries entered into bad projects with bad terms and they ended badly (there&#39;s an ongoing legal case against the Kenyan government for the railway project that you can find court reports from) and others the exact opposite.</p>\n\n<p>But broadly I think it&#39;s important to understand a few key points about the entire system of foreign lending.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>China itself isn&#39;t the centralised bohemoth people think. Its a variety of pretty autonomous provinces and departments. Arguably a lot of the problems with BRI come from this decentralisation and the competition it can create (think of how it can play out in weird ways such as during covid lock downs, with some places trying to compete to have the fewest cases etc) </p></li>\n<li><p>BRI isn&#39;t really a coherent plan. It&#39;s more a vague aspiration that the aforementioned disparate entities &#39;compete&#39; to try and interpret and implement (as with a lot of Chinese policy initiatives E.g. Common prosperity). Strong lending also predates BRI. Broadly the idea is just &#39;let&#39;s help other countries grow and improve infrastructure so we can all make money&#39; </p></li>\n<li><p>Lending comes in many forms from private to bilateral and from a variety of different targeted lending vehicles (E.g.

I think western countries are hesitant to invest in ramping up production on systems that they do not currently rely on heavily, nor do they plan to rely heavily on them in the future. No one wants to build a 155mm factory just to have it shuttered at the end of the war because NATO nations are nowhere near as heavily reliant on tube artillery for fire support and so there just isn't demand for the product. \n\nUltimately, the west clearly has the industrial capacity to produce massive amounts of war materiel in a very short period of time. But like any government policy, shifting resources into defense manufacturing has an associated cost in terms of disruption to their civilian economies. So the issue must be lack of political will, i.e. an unwillingness to incur costs to the civilian economy by exercising Defense Production Act powers, or whatever the national equivalent may be for other NATO countries. \n\nAnd they lack motivation to do so because it's not their country on the line, and it isn't their people fighting and dying (at least not their official military personnel).

        "body": "[Double Win: How Russian Oil Companies Defied Sanctions and Paid Less Tax](https://carnegieendowment.org/politika/89052)\n\nI'm posting the [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/AlexGabuev/status/1626149769318920193?t=fojh6mvc6fumnY3JjTVQGQ&s=19) below as it's more digestible. \n\nTl;dr: at least prior to the oil cap, Russian companies were manipulating the price for Russian oil (so it traded lower than it should have), relocating profits offshore (as they did before putin came to power) and undermining the Russian treasury. \n\n\n> Recent data on \ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddfa oil exports contains some unexpected revelations on who/what was really pushing the Urals price down (spoiler: not Western sanctions or boycotts), and who benefitted from it. \ud83e\uddf5 based on analysis of my new @CarnegieEndow colleague @SergeyVakulenk0 1/ \n\n> 2/ @SergeyVakulenk0, an energy veteran with 25+ years of experience in oil&gas who has recently joined @CarnegieEndow team, has dug into data, and found that price cap and Western embargo on \ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddfa oil don't work the way published price for Urals would suggest\n\n> 3/ It turns out that the beneficiaries from the lower Urals price were none other than the Russian oil majors Rosneft and Lukoil, as well as ExxonMobil, Gunvor, Hungary\u2019s MOL and Poland\u2019s PKN Orlen. How?\n\n> 4/ Pretty much immediately after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the West started shunning Russian crude oil, which began trading at about a 25% discount compared with rival products.\n\n> 5/ That created a strong market advantage for the refineries that were still taking it.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/politika/89052\">Double Win: How Russian Oil Companies Defied Sanctions and Paid Less Tax</a></p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m posting the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlexGabuev/status/1626149769318920193?t=fojh6mvc6fumnY3JjTVQGQ&amp;s=19\">twitter thread</a> below as it&#39;s more digestible. </p>\n\n<p>Tl;dr: at least prior to the oil cap, Russian companies were manipulating the price for Russian oil (so it traded lower than it should have), relocating profits offshore (as they did before putin came to power) and undermining the Russian treasury. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Recent data on \ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddfa oil exports contains some unexpected revelations on who/what was really pushing the Urals price down (spoiler: not Western sanctions or boycotts), and who benefitted from it. \ud83e\uddf5 based on analysis of my new @CarnegieEndow colleague @SergeyVakulenk0 1/ </p>\n\n<p>2/ @SergeyVakulenk0, an energy veteran with 25+ years of experience in oil&amp;gas who has recently joined @CarnegieEndow team, has dug into data, and found that price cap and Western embargo on \ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddfa oil don&#39;t work the way published price for Urals would suggest</p>\n\n<p>3/ It turns out that the beneficiaries from the lower Urals price were none other than the Russian oil majors Rosneft and Lukoil, as well as ExxonMobil, Gunvor, Hungary\u2019s MOL and Poland\u2019s PKN Orlen. How?</p>\n\n<p>4/ Pretty much immediately after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the West started shunning Russian crude oil, which began trading at about a 25% discount compared with rival products.</p>\n\n<p>5/ That created a strong market advantage for the refineries that were still taking it. In June there were reports of refining margins of $50-$70 per barrel (compared with an average of below $10 per barrel). No discount appears to have been passed on to consumers.</p>\n\n<p>6/ The biggest off-takers of Russian crude were the European subsidiaries of Rosneft and Lukoil.

Why is that a good thing? Because integrated companies are more diversified and having your assets offshore in Europe means you're also geographically diversified.

There are a couple notable exceptions, with Bulgaria being a very obvious one because they're excempt from the sanctions, but there is no indication *yet* that anyone is intentionally skirting the rules.
