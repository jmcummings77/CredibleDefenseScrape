Satellite imagery substantiates these developments, hinting at Ukrainian vehicles crossing Surovikin's Line.  \n>  \n>2/ A bit further south from the first image, the video captures a crossroad that was shelled by russians. In the background, you can see the burned area near the Surovikin Line, and the presence of black smoke in the image suggests that some object caught on fire.  \n>  \n>3/  Utilizing geolocation data from the video, it's evident that our forces executed maneuvers effectively, driving back the enemy and exploiting the gap. They have advanced close to Verbove, overcoming AT trenches, minefields, and dragon's teeth. A notable milestone  \n>  \n>4/ The heavily edited russian video leaves uncertainty about whether our troops established a bridgehead.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tatarigami_UA/status/1704726674435150186\">Tatarigami posts a thread on twitter, maybe best to read it there for the visuals but heres the text:</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Based on a recently uploaded video by russians, it&#39;s evident that Ukrainian forces successfully penetrated the Surovikin Line and disembarked infantry beyond it. Satellite imagery substantiates these developments, hinting at Ukrainian vehicles crossing Surovikin&#39;s Line.  </p>\n\n<p>2/ A bit further south from the first image, the video captures a crossroad that was shelled by russians. In the background, you can see the burned area near the Surovikin Line, and the presence of black smoke in the image suggests that some object caught on fire.  </p>\n\n<p>3/  Utilizing geolocation data from the video, it&#39;s evident that our forces executed maneuvers effectively, driving back the enemy and exploiting the gap. They have advanced close to Verbove, overcoming AT trenches, minefields, and dragon&#39;s teeth. A notable milestone  </p>\n\n<p>4/ The heavily edited russian video leaves uncertainty about whether our troops established a bridgehead. It&#39;s an encouraging and positive sign, and there is no doubt that russians will try to downplay it. The next several days will show if the penetration becomes a breakthrough.  </p>\n\n<p>5/ If you found this thread valuable, your support through likes, follows, and retweets of the first message greatly contributes to the visibility and enhancement of my content.

It might not happen under a hypothetical Trump 2024 Presidency, but I&#39;m confident it&#39;ll happen if tensions heat up in the Taiwan strait.</p>\n</div>",

It&#39;s really not crazy to say &quot; I care more about things that are close to me&quot; as I&#39;m sure you would probably kill to save someone you love but wouldn&#39;t really care what happens to someone&#39;s children halfway across the world. Yes, America cares more about Europe than Central Africa, that is just how humans work.</p>\n</div>",

Instead, she said, \u201cthe root cause of delays is insufficient industrial capacity and long production timelines.

They added that the US attributed the delay to coronavirus-affected supply chain issues, but the jets also have been dogged by software problems.\n\n>On the Patriot system, Resnick was referring to the US proposal in December to sell Taiwan as many as 100 of its most advanced air-defense system, also made by Lockheed, along with radar and support equipment in a deal valued at $882 million. The proposal, made under the provisions of a 2010 sale to the island, wasn\u2019t new but was called an enhancement to an earlier deal.\n\n>In a separate statement to the House panel, Ely Ratner, assistant secretary of defense for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs, said that in addition to proposed arms sales, the Pentagon is working closely with Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of Defense and its All-Out Defense Mobilization Agency on several initiatives.\n\n>\u201cWe are supporting the integration of Taiwan\u2019s military and civilian agencies on a range of issues from stockpiling of food, medical supplies and energy to hardening key infrastructure nodes,\u201d he said.",

They added that the US attributed the delay to coronavirus-affected supply chain issues, but the jets also have been dogged by software problems.</p>\n\n<p>On the Patriot system, Resnick was referring to the US proposal in December to sell Taiwan as many as 100 of its most advanced air-defense system, also made by Lockheed, along with radar and support equipment in a deal valued at $882 million. The proposal, made under the provisions of a 2010 sale to the island, wasn\u2019t new but was called an enhancement to an earlier deal.</p>\n\n<p>In a separate statement to the House panel, Ely Ratner, assistant secretary of defense for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs, said that in addition to proposed arms sales, the Pentagon is working closely with Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of Defense and its All-Out Defense Mobilization Agency on several initiatives.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe are supporting the integration of Taiwan\u2019s military and civilian agencies on a range of issues from stockpiling of food, medical supplies and energy to hardening key infrastructure nodes,\u201d he said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

For years, LMT's management had been complaining that AJRD was the bottleneck in increasing production of solid rocket motors that go into a variety of its products, including the now famous GMLRS. By mid-decade, there were only two U.S. producers of these rockets left in the U.S. due to consolidation and redundancies. The second one was Orbital ATK that was acquired by [NOC in 2018](https://investor.northropgrumman.com/investor-resources/orbital-atk-acquisition). Since LMT's acquisition of AJRD was considered a vertical acquisition, and because of the wide-ranging repercussions of these deals, the [FTC said](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-25/aerojet-shares-plunge-as-lockheed-expects-ftc-to-block-deal) it would sue to block the acquisition in *January 2022*. \n\nAJRD, in the meantime, was in dire need of a capital injection to scale up throughput and modernize its operations. The DoD finally made this investment in AJRD via a Manufacturing Capability Expansion and Investment Prioritization (MCEIP) in [*April 2023*](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3362263/dod-strengthens-supply-chain-for-solid-rocket-motors/). In the meantime, [LHX was trying to acquire AJRD](https://www.l3harris.com/newsroom/press-release/2022/12/l3harris-acquire-aerojet-rocketdyne), while [LMT was putting up hurdles](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/lockheed-says-it-has-raised-concerns-over-l3harris-aerojet-deal-2023-06-20/) to prevent the deal from closing, which further delayed closing. In the meantime, NOC was slowly starting to lay the foundation to [raise production](https://news.northropgrumman.com/news/releases/northrop-grumman-invests-in-new-solid-rocket-motor-manufacturing-facilities-in-magna-utah) for its rocket motors just *about a year ago*. \n\nNow, why am I italicizing these dates and why are they so important? Because the invasion of Ukraine started in Feb 2022, HIMARS/GMLRS were approved by the summer, and you had news report after news report, thinktank after thinktank, analyst after analyst, all saying that ammunition production needed to be scaled up. That's putting aside the facts that solid rocket motors go in more than just GMLRS (including stingers and javelins) and that this issue had been highlighted by various managements (beyond just LMT's) for close to a decade. Yet, throughout this process, the FTC was still blocking the deal, these companies were still trying to protect their turf, the DoD was absent, and shareholders were waiting with patience with nary any activism.

The FTC would not have blocked the initial deal for LMT to purchase AJRD to start with. \n\nThat's not to say that in the *long-term*, antitrust laws aren't extremely valuable. Again, the entire reason that this issue exists *is* because the industry had consolidated to the extent it did, and that power is now so concentrated in a few manufacturers. If the usually pro-free market, invisible hand WSJ is calling for more monopoly busting in the defense contractor sector, then you know the situation has got really out of hand. Further, vertical integrations are always going to receive more pushback from regulators like the FTC. *However*, in the short-term, in the case of a peer-level hot war that the U.S. was involved in, this deal would not have been blocked and throughput would have scaled up immensely. \n\n>none of these companies are reporting lower profits that show they are spending and taking expenses to scale production drastically.\n\nJust to be clear, capex doesn't flow through the income statement at the time it's taken.

Information that's not publicly available suggests providing ATACMS would actually be a bad idea. I'm not sure what kind of information that might be.

Russia or some of its partners have some options of direct retaliation (i.e. not against Ukraine) that lay in the grey zone and which the administration is afraid of triggering, either because they doubt they could respond adequately, or because they don't want to deal with the consequences. E.g. things like large-scale cyberattacks, which some people on Sullivan's team (and Sullivan himself) would know about, given their ties to tech.

There may, in fact, be a real risk of escalation; and it may, in fact, be a real red line. We don't know if that's the case because, true to the old Soviet playbook, Russia's foreign communication has been an embarrassing, but efficient combination of strong statements and playing the victim card. That means everything was claimed to be a red line at some point and an unprovoked escalation against a peace-loving nation that was cowardly attacked by Azov neo-nazis or whatever, so *any* claim like that is bound to sound non-credible by now.

The author also brings up that China would likely be counter-blockaded by the US, and that China would be able to last a counter blockade much longer than Taiwan. However I think this assumes that the US and Taiwan (maybe Japan and Australia) refrains from targeting the Chinese mainland. The CONUS would not be the battlefield whereas Taiwan and China would. The US and its allies would be able to weather and sustain the war much longer than China could provided Taiwan could. And I slightly lean towards senior pentagon officials testimony to Congress over the authors assessment of the US' ability to supply Taiwan. Targeting civilian cargo ships would receive international condemnation even if it's just a threat. Inducing a famine and starving out 23 million Taiwanese in order to get them to surrender would too and would be like the Holodomor. And the US Navy would also be targeting the Chinese fleet around the Strait and SCS and ECS lowering their chances of a successful blockade. I think in some worst case scenario blockades, the US government could even use legislation to commandeer civilian cargo ships and use them to go on resupply runs.",

Plus, depending on the president, it's entirely possible the US would decide not to directly intervene in such a conflict at all, a major win for China. The war being a US choice, rather than a US response to a direct attack, would also potentially influence public opinion enough that the US wouldn't be able to sustain a long war. \n\nThat being said, I think a Chinese first strike would be much more advantageous than you seem to imply.

The comparison to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor doesn't sit right with me for the simple fact that the US in 1941 had the industrial might and time necessary to transition to a wartime footing that the US in say 2025 wouldn't have. In a Taiwan War scenario, time would be of the essence as Taiwan wouldn't be able to stand on its own for very long. If most forward deployed US assets in the Pacific got smoked on Day 1, it's hard to imagine a scenario in which the US would be able to assemble a force capable of relieving pressure on Taiwan in time to prevent their surrender.

We will find out soon if Turkey decides to have a public spat with US.\n* Relationship between US and Iran has not changed (despite what one might read into from recent prisoner swap)\n* I'm guessing aim of sanction is more punitive than suppressing?

We will find out soon if Turkey decides to have a public spat with US.\n\nEntities and individuals get sanctioned all the time, even from friendly countries. It's relatively procedural. It only gets messy when the entities/individuals are politically connected or somehow influential. \n\n>Relationship between US and Iran has not changed (despite what one might read into from recent prisoner swap)\n\nWhile true, this has nothing to do with these sanctions. China just slapped sanctions on U.S. defense contractors, the U.S. has sanctioned German nationals, etc. Sanctions, tariffs and trade disagreements are a part and parcel of international relations. \n\n>But if they primarily supply other Chinese buyers, why would they stop?\n\nBecause sanctions usually target financing and money transfer systems. You can have no supplier/customer relationships outside of your home country, but you might still want to park your cash in banks outside of your home country in hard currencies. Or need external financing. Or facilitate future expansions or need external suppliers for one-offs. Or you may have kids studying abroad, family members who need medical care abroad. Or you may just want to take a vacation.",

EU farmers are upset about it because lifting the tariffs on Ukrainian agricultural produce has been the largest exception of this type granted within the framework of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in a long time. They're afraid that, without the heavy subsidies of the CAP, they might actually have to start running their businesses competently, and the sudden influx of extra-communitary produce onto an infrastructure that's been mainly handling intra-communitary produce quantities has prevented them from engaging in some of their price gouging practices.\n\nE.g. in Romania, Hungary and (to a lesser degree, thanks to their sunflower oil industry) Bulgaria, farmers claim that the influx of Ukrainian grain brought the prices down to unsustainable levels. However, every time someone asks them to show numbers about that, they get squirrely, and no one in dependent industries (e.g. baking) corroborates it. The real problem is that they now need to share grain *storage* space. The demand for storage space has gone up, so the price for that has gone up as well, and that means farmers need to sell their produce more quickly, rather than stock up on it and sell months after the harvest, when grain prices are up.\n\nThat (and analogous mechanisms in Poland, whatever they are -- that's a separate transit route that I'm not familiar with) certainly makes a dent in farmers' pockets but considering how much tax payers' money (including mine) goes into their subsidies, I'm not particularly sympathetic. If farmers in a war-torn country, many of whom have lost a good chunk of their farmlands, who are dependent on a workforce that's been hollowed out by mobilisation, emmigration and outright damn bombing for an year and a half, and have to pay crazy insurance to get their grain out through mined waters under constant bombing can outcompete European farmers, that's on the farmers IMHO.\n\nThe CAP is one of the biggest items on the EU's budget (if not the biggest), it's been at 30-40% for about half a decade now but it used to be as high as 60%. I get it's a crisis but if EU farmers can't ride it despite decades of extremely heavy subsidising, something's very wrong.\n\nThe CAP *is* a blessing for small farms but it's the heavy players that receive the best protection under it, and also the ones who speak most vocally against Ukrainian grain deals. They do have a lot of lobbying power because a) they employ a lot of people in areas that EU states, particularly in E/SE/S Europe, have been happy to keep underdeveloped since the EU was subsidising the industry keeping people employed (i.e. agriculture) and b) they control many \"intermediary\" agricultural markets as well, either directly (e.g. they're the ones selling to other related markets, e.g. animal fodder production) or indirectly (e.g. they also have whole or partial ownership in milling or alcohol production plants).\n\nNobody wants to deal with these folks before an election, especially since most of the vote base they cover is conservative and susceptible to conspiracy bullshit and, thus, easily grabbed by Russian-controlled or, as in Hungary, Russian-aligned parties.\n\n(Edit: in case that wasn't obvious from above, since I also live in the EU, please note that this is inherently a biased view. I'm familiar with the topic by proxy, as I have customers in adjacent industries, but I'm not specifically familiar with the agricultural industry on a professional level, and I'm mainly aiming to provide some informal sample counterpoints. Consequently, it should be taken with a grain of salt, as it's not an analysis informed by in-depth research.)",
