We also have to clear unexploded ordnance and landmines. Residents will only be able to return after the clearance operation. The [new] administration will be run by Matupi CDF Brigade-1.\u201d\n\n>The group said it had seized a large cache of weapons including artillery from junta battalions. The Chin Brotherhood and allies also suffered casualties in the fighting, said its spokesman Salai Ha Awn, without providing details.\n\nSome of the weapons [here](https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=484055660792315&set=pcb.484056154125599).\n\n>\u201cMatupi is in a strategic location connecting Rakhine with control in southern Chin State,\u201d said Ko Yaw Marn, spokesman of Mindat township people\u2019s administration.\n\n>\u201cThe regime built its tactical command in Matupi because it attaches great importance to the town. If we can seize Mindat, Kanpetlet and advance further into Yaw [aka Gangaw and Pakokku districts in Magwe Region], we will also threaten the junta\u2019s ordnance factories that manufacture 250-lb and 500-lb bombs for warplanes. If the ordnance factories collapse, the junta\u2019s mechanism will also collapse.\u201d\n\nThe Chin forces are expressing a willingness to enter the Magwe region. Magwe is almost entirely Bamar in its composition, so they'll need to work alongside the local PDF units in the area. The CDF haven't taken Mindat yet, so it's probably best for them not to get ahead of themselves. \n\nWith regards to halting bomb production, it would be the first time junta factories have been halted from producing weapons. That said, the junta can likely attain bombs from their friends. \n\nTaking Matupi is a big gain, further reducing the Tat's already extremely minimal control over Chin territory. The remaining forces are isolated deep in hostile territory. If the CDF can capitalize on this game and take Mindat the only big area under Tat control in Chin State will be Hakha, the capital. Taking that, Mindat and Falam will essentially clear the region of the junta's influence.",

            "body": "The Su-27's Ukraine has don't fit into many of their early/mid cold war HAS (hardened aircraft shelters). In many cases these are best case scenarios for dispersal. Ukraine has a habit of rapidly moving its aircraft around between civilian and military airbases to avoid situations like this but this will inevitably result in them getting caught out. Rock > Ukraine < Hard place. \n\nEven hiding the aircraft would do very little good, the proliferation of Russian ISR platforms and capabilities make it increasingly difficult to just throw a tarp over an aircraft or hide it in the woods. The best option for Ukraine at this point is to rapidly disperse to non-primary fields and keep the Russians guessing or chasing as opposed to giving them time to carefully craft a strike. That includes using fields within relative proximity to the front line. There are also benefits to maintaining this proximity, shorter sortie times, better availability to respond to Russian threats as well as reduced wear/tear on the airframes themselves which are nearing the end of their usable lives. \n\nThat all being said, the proximity to the front in this situation should have warranted more care. They must have known that they were under Orlan coverage, I can only imagine that it was either sloppy decision making or they were just doing stop/go rearmament here and assumed they could get in/out with minimal risk (a clearly incorrect assumption).\n\nRegardless both sides need to adopt more widespread usage of HAS, they would greatly limit the effectiveness of submunition strikes, drones and even just normal kinetic strikes. HAS make it more costly on a per airframe basis, for each aircraft you wish to strike you have to expend a missile, seven sheltered Su-27's, seven missiles at minimum have to make it through, instead of just one or two Iskanders peppering exposed airframes with submunitions... \n\nIn my experience the decisions makers in Air forces around the world are ***extremely slow*** to adapt to changing environments, consistently I've found the prevailing and relatively eye rolling old fashioned sentiment to be based on pictures from the 90s/2000s of Iraqi and Kuwaiti HAS utterly demolished, and decisions being made on the efficacy of hardened shelters based on these old images instead of based on the lessons we're learning right now and have been learning for more than 2 years. \n\nThe problem is the battlespace is much different today than it was even 10 years ago let alone 20/30+.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>The Su-27&#39;s Ukraine has don&#39;t fit into many of their early/mid cold war HAS (hardened aircraft shelters). In many cases these are best case scenarios for dispersal. Ukraine has a habit of rapidly moving its aircraft around between civilian and military airbases to avoid situations like this but this will inevitably result in them getting caught out. Rock &gt; Ukraine &lt; Hard place. </p>\n\n<p>Even hiding the aircraft would do very little good, the proliferation of Russian ISR platforms and capabilities make it increasingly difficult to just throw a tarp over an aircraft or hide it in the woods. The best option for Ukraine at this point is to rapidly disperse to non-primary fields and keep the Russians guessing or chasing as opposed to giving them time to carefully craft a strike. That includes using fields within relative proximity to the front line. There are also benefits to maintaining this proximity, shorter sortie times, better availability to respond to Russian threats as well as reduced wear/tear on the airframes themselves which are nearing the end of their usable lives. </p>\n\n<p>That all being said, the proximity to the front in this situation should have warranted more care. They must have known that they were under Orlan coverage, I can only imagine that it was either sloppy decision making or they were just doing stop/go rearmament here and assumed they could get in/out with minimal risk (a clearly incorrect assumption).</p>\n\n<p>Regardless both sides need to adopt more widespread usage of HAS, they would greatly limit the effectiveness of submunition strikes, drones and even just normal kinetic strikes. HAS make it more costly on a per airframe basis, for each aircraft you wish to strike you have to expend a missile, seven sheltered Su-27&#39;s, seven missiles at minimum have to make it through, instead of just one or two Iskanders peppering exposed airframes with submunitions... </p>\n\n<p>In my experience the decisions makers in Air forces around the world are <strong><em>extremely slow</em></strong> to adapt to changing environments, consistently I&#39;ve found the prevailing and relatively eye rolling old fashioned sentiment to be based on pictures from the 90s/2000s of Iraqi and Kuwaiti HAS utterly demolished, and decisions being made on the efficacy of hardened shelters based on these old images instead of based on the lessons we&#39;re learning right now and have been learning for more than 2 years. </p>\n\n<p>The problem is the battlespace is much different today than it was even 10 years ago let alone 20/30+.
