Kofman was joined by Rob Lee and Franz Stephan-Gady to discuss their impressions of the first days of the Ukrainian offensive. It was recorded the morning of Wednesday, June 14th. \n\nKey Takeaways\n\n* They believe the counteroffensive officially began sometime around June 4th. Ukraine has made some progress capturing territory, but its already clear that some of the more optimistic takes of how the offensive would go were wildly off the mark (i.e. no quick drive to the Azov Sea). The offensive does seem to be going along what \"realistic\" impressions expected though. \n\n* Main fighting is taking place on three fronts right now, in Zaporizhzhia around Orikhiv and Velka Novosilka, in Donetsk around Vuhledar, and around Bakhmut. Ukrainians are advancing on a wide front near Velka Novosilka, with much of the advances the result of veteran units. Goal seems to be to keep Russia guessing about where main thrust against Russian lines on that axis will hit. Fighting around Bakhmut is all from units who have been stationed in the area for a while already, once that clears up we can finally have better conversation about the legacy of battle for Bakhmut. \n\n* There's a lot happening behind the scenes that makes it hard to tell how the fighting is going. Much isn't recorded, and what is recorded often isn't being released, or is being released days after the fact. \n\n* Russian forces are defending very well, especially along the Tokmak axis. Russia has some of its best remaining units on the frontlines, especially in Zaporizhzhia, with mobilized units in reserve. It remains to be seen what might happen as those quality units get attrited though, might make future Ukrainian advances easier. \n\n* They discussed the attack that left many Bradleys and Leopards damaged/destroyed. Said that Russia did an excellent job layering defenses: mines helped slow the attack and disable vehicles, which allowed them to use artillery to pound exposed vehicles, and longrange ATGMs, especially those from Russian rotary wing aircraft, causes even more losses among Ukrainian attackers. EW was likely also used to interfere with Ukrainian communications and ISR. Spetsnaz units were instrumental in that defensive operation. \n\n* They talked about the newly formed Ukrainian brigades, with the takeaway being that its too early to gauge how effective they've been so far. They reiterated that there's a lot of the fighting were not seeing and not to take too much away from what we have seen so far. They kept joking about how platoon/company level engagements from this conflict are the most thoroughly analyzed in history, but that this wasn't helpful for understanding the big picture.\n\n* They think Ukraine has had great success hitting Russian forces 10-15 km behind the line, and that were only seeing a tiny fraction of these losses in particular. \n\n* ATGMs being fired from Russian rotary wing aircraft have been wreaking havoc on Ukrainian forces, raising questions about the availability/effectiveness of Ukrainian SHORAD. They also noted that this is very normal for offensive actions however, as units push past their air defense envelope. They will be keeping close eye on how this evolves (or doesn't) over the coming weeks. \n\n* Progress in the offensive has been slowed by poor weather in the South. Russian units complained that it was impacting their usage of drones and rotary wing aviation. \n\n* They're a little confused as to what Russian defensive strategy is, as they've seem evidence of them employing mobile defense, but also launching localized counterattacks in an attempt to retake ground. There seems to be poor communication between units. Overall seems like Russia is trying to attrit Ukrainian units before Ukrainian forces reach main Russian defensive lines with the goal of either defeating the Ukrainian offensive at those main lines or shortly afterwards. \n\n* Kofman noted that there's a misperception that there's nothing behind the main defensive lines, and that if/when Ukraine breaches them, there's nothing standing in their way. It's not true, there are additional minefields and reserve trenches behind main lines. Russia is also working on building defenses even now in the midst of the offensive. \n\n* Compared current stage to a chess match, with both sides maneuvering to try to get the other to commit their reserves. It's clear that Ukraine still has many units in reserve and that we still don't know what the main objectives of the offensive are. After Kharkiv/Kherson offensives through analysts for a loop, they're hesitant to suggest that they know what Ukraine's plans really are. \n\n* Key to this offensive won't just be how it affects control over Ukrainian territory, but how both forces come out of the fighting. The side better able to reconstitute itself afterwards will be in a better position for future offensives. \n\n* Western kit has not proved to be wunderwaffen. It has however, proven to be much more survivable than the Soviet kit Ukraine is used to, with obvious benefits. Also provides Ukraine with *much better* night fighting capabilities, which they are using to great effect, especially TOW missiles on Bradleys. \n\nThere's a bunch I'm sure I missed, this was a long (>45 min) and wide-ranging conversation, and one of the best in many months.",

Originally the UA intended a dual offensive against the South, exactly as they telegraphed from mid July onward, one against the Kherson bridgehead and the other towards Melitopol. \n\nBut the US military top brass advised against it, since those were the two most heavily defended Russian locations in Ukraine. Having presented data from military simulations that it would fail, the UA cancelled the Melitopol attack. However, they couldn't just attack the Kherson bridgehead, they needed a fixing attack somewhere else to divert Russian attention.

From a distance, he spotted the small Ukrainian rescue boat traversing floodwaters that had submerged the 60-year-old\u2019s entire neighborhood after a catastrophic dam collapse in the country\u2019s embattled south.\n\nHe and others boarded with sighs of relief \u2014 interrupted suddenly by the crackle of bullets.\n\nShpalin ducked, and a bullet scraped his back. He felt one pierce his arm, then his leg. The boat's rescue worker cried into the radio for reinforcements. \u201cOur boat is leaking,\u201d Shpalin heard him say. An older man died before his eyes, his lips turning blue.\n\nTheir vessel, taking civilians to safety in Kherson city across the river, had been shot by Russian soldiers positioned in a nearby house, according to Ukrainian officials **and witnesses on the boat.**\n\n\u201cThey (Russians) let the boats through, those coming to rescue people,\u201d Shpalin said. \u201cBut when the boats were full of people, they started shooting.\u201d\n\nAccounts of Russian assistance vary among survivors, but many evacuees and residents accuse Russian authorities of doing little or nothing to help displaced residents. Some civilians said evacuees were sometimes forced to present Russian passports if they wanted to leave.\n\nThe AP spoke with 10 families rescued from the eastern bank, as well as with rescue workers, officials and victims injured on the rescue missions.\n\n\u201cThe Russian Federation provided nothing. No aid, no evacuation. They abandoned people alone to deal with the disaster,\u201d said Yulia Valhe, evacuated from the Russian-occupied town of Oleshky. \u201cI have my friends who stayed there, people I know who need help. At the moment, I can\u2019t do anything except to say to them, \u2018Hold on.\u2019\u201d\n\nValerii Lobitskyi, a volunteer rescuer, said shelling often derailed the missions. He has been shot at once, and on another occasion had to abort a mission to rescue an older woman after a close call with a Russian motor boat.\n\nEvery civilian evacuated from the eastern bank carried a harrowing tale of survival, of racing to relocate to higher ground. They described the initial scramble on the morning of June 6. Within hours, the water came gushing in, reaching their ankles and then submerging entire floors.\n\nIn Oleshky, many residents moved from the outskirts of town to the center, which sits on an elevated plain.\n\nValhe, who was rescued with her family on June 12, said neighbors and friends tried to save people themselves in the absence of an official rescue effort.\n\n\u201cI saw soldiers, I saw FSB workers (Russia's Federal Security Service), but no rescue service,\u201d she said.\n\nShpalin said he lied to Russian soldiers when they tried to evacuate him to another area. He had heard from others who accepted the Russian offer that they were taken only to a nearby village and told they couldn't go further unless they agreed to obtain Russian passports.\n\nShpalin told the soldiers he wouldn't leave because he had lost his documents in the flood. In reality, they were on his person.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t believe them,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen the Ukrainian rescuers found him, he was sheltering with other civilians on a sandy hill near a quarry in the village of Kardashynka.\n\nThe attack that wounded Shpalin on the evacuation boat on June 11 killed three civilians and injured 10 others. At least two police officers also were wounded. Kherson authorities and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's chief of staff said Russian soldiers fired the shots.\n\nDrone footage obtained by the AP shows gunshots being fired from a nearby summer home as the evacuation boat passes an estuary. The video's authenticity was confirmed by Tolokonnikov.\n\nSerhii, 59, another evacuee on the boat, said that he saw Russian soldiers on the balcony of the house. They shouted something \u2014 \u201cMove on,\u201d or \u201cDon\u2019t move\u201d \u2014 then fired, he said. Serhii, who would only give his first name because his family still lives in occupied territory, threw his body over his wife\u2019s to protect her.\n\nAnother evacuee, Kateryna Krupych, said she looked out the window on June 7 to find mucky water surrounding her home on the island of Chaika, in the gray zone between front lines. Houses floated by. She packed up her family\u2019s supplies and they left in a boat, but got separated along the way. Eventually, they were all rescued by Ukrainians.\n\nKrupych said the previous eight months under Russian occupation had been hard. Her family survived by relying on the kindness of neighbors who fled to Kherson city. They told her where to find the spare keys to their homes and leftover food supplies.\n\n\u201cIt was mentally difficult when the (Russians) entered our island, when they terrorized us,\u201d she said. Russian soldiers frequently passed their home, she said, pressuring them to leave.\n\nPlus, \u201c(Russians) can force-evacuate people \u2014 we are scared of this, we don\u2019t want to go to their territories,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be forgotten.\u201d",

Kherson authorities and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy&#39;s chief of staff said Russian soldiers fired the shots.</p>\n\n<p>Drone footage obtained by the AP shows gunshots being fired from a nearby summer home as the evacuation boat passes an estuary. The video&#39;s authenticity was confirmed by Tolokonnikov.</p>\n\n<p>Serhii, 59, another evacuee on the boat, said that he saw Russian soldiers on the balcony of the house. They shouted something \u2014 \u201cMove on,\u201d or \u201cDon\u2019t move\u201d \u2014 then fired, he said. Serhii, who would only give his first name because his family still lives in occupied territory, threw his body over his wife\u2019s to protect her.</p>\n\n<p>Another evacuee, Kateryna Krupych, said she looked out the window on June 7 to find mucky water surrounding her home on the island of Chaika, in the gray zone between front lines. Houses floated by. She packed up her family\u2019s supplies and they left in a boat, but got separated along the way. Eventually, they were all rescued by Ukrainians.</p>\n\n<p>Krupych said the previous eight months under Russian occupation had been hard. Her family survived by relying on the kindness of neighbors who fled to Kherson city. They told her where to find the spare keys to their homes and leftover food supplies.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt was mentally difficult when the (Russians) entered our island, when they terrorized us,\u201d she said. Russian soldiers frequently passed their home, she said, pressuring them to leave.</p>\n\n<p>Plus, \u201c(Russians) can force-evacuate people \u2014 we are scared of this, we don\u2019t want to go to their territories,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be forgotten.\u201d</p>\n</div>",

T-90M and Type 99A can be dealt with by 120mm ordnance.</p>\n</div>",

One thing I'm certain of, though, if there's no real answer in the medium-term, and it doesn't target Russia *the country*, rather than just some Russian officials personally, then the generation that comes after us will see a lot more violence like this on European soil in international conflicts. The response doesn't need to be in the form of formal sanctions IMHO; it can consist merely of reduced international standing, like making sure it'll be years before a Russian head of state can set foot in an EU country and talk to a head of state.

In fact they've been stockpiling so many vehicles that they can't afford to care for them correctly, and the best majority of them have been destroyed not by battles, but just by time and the elements. Running off the numbers in the other post, they have something like 100,000 tanks, maybe a couple thousand have been consumed by this war maximum, but probably something like 80-90,000 of them have been destroyed by the elements or scrapped because they or other Soviet successor states didn't care for them.\n\nSo I don't think this is a question that can be usefully answered by looking at anticipated production. And I don't think tanks or other vehicles is a terribly useful metric either - Russia had more tanks than they needed before the war, let most of them rot because they didn't need them, and still has had enough to fight this war just fine. I think the better question is when Russia will have the equipment to fight another war, and I'd personally say that 5 years or so sounds about right to me.\n\n\nBut I don't think vehicles are really going to be the thing that determines when they're ready. The biggest problem they're facing is that their personnel specifically performed awfully at the beginning of the war, and continue to perform poorly because of bad training and low morale. Those things are part of the way the Russian military is designed, and I think they're going to be a lot harder for them to fix. I think that the normal state of the Russian military is poor training and readiness because everyone involved is corrupt. Then during periods of crisis, such as fighting a war, they gradually start performing better because corruption becomes less tolerated. (And we can see the Russian army improving somewhat over the course of the war in Ukraine, although the Ukrainians are probably improving faster.) That better performance lasts for a bit after the war, but eventually they start being corrupt again, and the less prospect of a future war the system sees the sooner they go back to being corrupt. So at the same time they're rebuilding their equipment, their personnel problems will likely reassert themselves.\n\nThe question if this happens is whether they'll have overlap between the period where they rebuild their equipment to acceptable levels and the period where their personnel are effective. But they may very well be a more effective fighting force if the next war they fight is in 5 years than if they wait 20 years, even though they'd surely have more equipment in 20 years.",

How much of the material in question was lost?\n3. How quickly can these factories pump out new vehicles?\n4. How much money can be put into making new vehicles off the line?\n\nStuff like that is relevant. But assuming that Russia just doesn't care about the money, we'll go off of a couple data points.\n\nThe USSR managed to build tens of thousands of tanks over the course of some 40 years. It produced around [20,000+ T-62s in 14 years.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-62) And then there's [the T54 and T-55](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-54/T-55), which the USSR built around 50,000 of for 35 years.\n\n[25,000 T-72s were built from 1972 onward.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-72)\n\nSo, looking at the math, we've got one big hiccup; the USSR was not Russia. It had Industrial capacity that Russia does not. Ukraine included in that.\n\nT-62 production overlaps with T-54 and T-55 production for 14 years. And the T-72 doesn't.\n\n20,000 T-54s/T-55s + 20,000 T-62s during that same period gives us around 40,000 tanks per 14 years, or 2,857 tanks per year for those 14 years...maybe, sort of roughly.\n\nThat's our baseline metric. The years '61 to '75 of the USSR in terms of sheer tank production.\n\nLet's say Russia has half that production capability for tanks. It has lost [10,600+](https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/02/attack-on-europe-documenting-equipment.html) vehicles in the Ukraine War so far, to various causes. 4,000+ of which are tanks. So we're looking, at least based on the composition of the documented losses, of about a 2:5 tank/vehicle ratio.\n\nAssuming that Russia pumps out 3 \"other vehicles\" per 2 tanks on a yearly average, we're looking at around 1,428 \\* 2.5 = 3,570 vehicles produced in Russia per year.\n\nWhich means it'd take three years to replace the lost vehicles if the war ended right now.\n\nThis changes depending on whether you believe Russia retained 60%, or 80% of the USSR's production capacity, that capacity probably changed and undulated a bit after the USSR's immediate collapse, a whole lot of stuff just got glossed over by these fairly surface level calculations, but considering that some of these vehicles are just...no longer in production and there's no reason to change that (T-54 and T-55)...we're probably looking at a good 5 years...minimum, for Russia to fill in the giant vehicle hole that it created for itself in Ukraine.",
