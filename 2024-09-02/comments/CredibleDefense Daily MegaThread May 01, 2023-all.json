Does seem rather direct to declare it as an exercise practicing defense of Taiwan.

The railway from Mariupol to Melitopol winds all the way up to Polohy, so even with limited success the advance will cut that off. Then, the Ukrainians have three highways to advance down, and as an added bonus, those axes of advance are separated by rivers so it's difficult for the Russians to shift forces from one axis to another. Last and probably most importantly, there's no significant urban areas to invest and/or bypass before the Azov. The Ukrainians wouldn't actually have to get to Berdyansk to cut the M14 autoroute.\n\nThere is perhaps some propaganda advantage to capturing major centers like Melitopol or Mariupol, but cutting the land bridge at Berdyansk has the same strategic effect for potentially less cost in terms of men and material. Cutting the land bridge would separate the Russians into two chunks, allowing the Ukrainians to follow-up by exploiting the internal versus external lines of communication.

        "body": "Don\u2019t know if it has been posted here before but this weeks briefing in the Economist focuses on the Russian economy. Just a few excerpts from the multiple page article:\n\n* Russia continues to import almost as much as it did before the invasion. New trading partners have sprung up to replace the West. China now sells twice as much to Russia as it did in 2019. \u201cParallel\u201d imports\u2014unauthorised sales from the West to Russia via a third country of everything from fizzy drinks to computer chips\u2014have soared. In 2022 imports from the eu to Armenia mysteriously doubled, even as Armenian exports to Russia tripled. Serbia\u2019s exports of phones to Russia rose from $8,518 in 2021 to $37m in 2022. Shipments of washing machines from Kazakhstan to Russia rose from zero in 2021 to nearly 100,000 units last year.\n\n* Russia also seems to be getting hold of the parts it needs to keep its civilian planes airborne, somehow. Hackers have been stealing updates of aircraft software that Russian firms can no longer buy. Crashes, although frequent by Western standards, have not increased. \n\n* Lower hydrocarbon sales mean lower government revenues. In 2022 the Russian government ran a deficit of about 3trn roubles ($37bn), or 2% of gdp. This year it is planning something similar, but actual spending and taxation data so far this year make that look optimistic. A deficit in the range of at least 10trn roubles, as much as 5% of gdp, looks likelier\u2014high by Russian standards.\n\n* All the same, the Russian state has plenty of options to fund itself. Russia\u2019s sovereign-wealth fund still has about $150bn (about 10% of gdp), even after being drained of about $30bn last year. The government could also issue more debt. Last year\u2019s bumper exports have left big Russian energy firms with lots of cash they must stash somewhere. Those firms, which are largely state-owned anyway, could also be hit with a windfall tax, as they were last year. And **Russian financial institutions hold sufficient assets to cover 10trn-rouble deficits for 25 years** a huge resource the government might seek to tap in some way. Richard Connolly, an expert on the Russian economy at rusi, a think-tank, says, \u201cThe government can always fund itself by taking money from big companies.\u201d\n\n* **Money, in other words, will not be a severe constraint on the war effort. Demands on the budget for this purpose are in any case modest.** Our best guess, based on comparing actual spending figures with what was budgeted before the war, is that **Russia\u2019s assault on Ukraine is currently costing it about 5trn roubles a year, or 3% of gdp\u2013less than America spent on the Korean war.**\n\n* Overall, the Russian economy has proved resilient. Real gdp fell by only 2-3% last year\u2014far less than the 10-15% decline that many economists had predicted. A \u201ccurrent activity indicator\u201d compiled by Goldman Sachs, a bank, which correlated closely with official gdp numbers before the war, shows that Russia emerged from recession about a year ago. Most forecasters believe the economy will grow this year (see chart 2). \n\n* All this suggests that Mr Putin should be able to maintain the war effort for some time to come. Expanding it, however, is another matter. Some on the right are calling for Mr Putin to spend more than a few percentage points of gdp on the invasion. After all, Russia has embraced total war before\u2014including in 1942 and 1943, when it spent an astonishing 60% of its gdp on the military, according to \u201cAccounting for War\u201d, a book by Mark Harrison published in 1996. \n\n* It\u2019s unclear that spending vastly more money would achieve the desired results anyway. Russia\u2019s economy has become more centralised, but it is not the planned, command-and-control apparatus of the Soviet times. Converting a budgetary bazooka into weapons of a more conventional sort would thus, at best, take time. The effort would exacerbate the bottlenecks that are already constricting Russia\u2019s military output, in machinery subject to sanctions, for example, and in skilled workers. Much would depend on the continued assistance of China, the Gulf states and other countries through which Russian capital and imports flow\u2013and they might be nervous about abetting a big Russian escalation. \n\n* But it is hard to see how Mr Putin could do that while maintaining economic stability and preserving living standards. The first problem would be raising money fast. Not all the sovereign-wealth fund\u2019s assets are liquid. Printing money would spur inflation, causing the rouble to lose value and eroding the living standards the government has worked so hard to preserve. Loading up banks with huge amounts of public debt overnight might have a similar effect, stirring doubts about how soundly the economy was being managed. Tax rises or a big shift in public expenditure towards defence would also eat into personal incomes. And any of these measures would undermine the air of calm, control and stability that Mr Putin is at pains to maintain. \n\n* **Throwing the kitchen sink at Ukraine therefore looks out of the question. \u201cConsidering Russia\u2019s existing capabilities and limitations, it will likely opt for a slower-paced attritional campaign in Ukraine,\u201d asserts the csis report. Mr Putin has succeeded in insulating the Russian economy from the worst effects of war and sanctions\u2013but in a way that makes the war hard to win.**\n\nhttps://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/04/23/russias-economy-can-withstand-a-long-war-but-not-a-more-intense-one",

New trading partners have sprung up to replace the West. China now sells twice as much to Russia as it did in 2019. \u201cParallel\u201d imports\u2014unauthorised sales from the West to Russia via a third country of everything from fizzy drinks to computer chips\u2014have soared. In 2022 imports from the eu to Armenia mysteriously doubled, even as Armenian exports to Russia tripled. Serbia\u2019s exports of phones to Russia rose from $8,518 in 2021 to $37m in 2022. Shipments of washing machines from Kazakhstan to Russia rose from zero in 2021 to nearly 100,000 units last year.\n\n>**These arrangements have drawbacks. Russia\u2019s economic hubs are nearer to Brussels than to Beijing. Higher transport costs mean higher prices. People also have less choice than before (one Muscovite complains about the difficulty of finding mortadella). According to a recent survey by Romir, a Russian market-research firm, two-thirds of Russians reckon the quality of the products they buy is deteriorating.**\n\n>**What is more, not all goods can be obtained in sufficient quantities through backchannels. Many Russian-made medications, which depend on imported raw materials, are in short supply. The car industry, meanwhile, is struggling with a shortage of imported semiconductors. Production was down 70% in January-February, compared with the same period a year before.**'\n\n>**Yet even if Russia cannot make as many cars any more, it can still import them. After Lada, a Soviet stalwart, the most popular brand in Russia is now Haval, a mid-range Chinese marque. Its monthly sales have increased 331% over the past year.**\n\n>Russia also seems to be getting hold of the parts it needs to keep its civilian planes airborne, somehow. Hackers have been stealing updates of aircraft software that Russian firms can no longer buy. Crashes, although frequent by Western standards, have not increased.\n\n>**The impact of sanctions on Russia\u2019s exports has been bigger\u2013but Western countries always shied away from making them too severe for fear of pushing up energy prices for their own consumers to unbearable levels. The eu\u2019s imports of Russian gas have fallen dramatically. Russia has limited capacity to divert the exports to China, since the pipeline linking the two countries is small. Shipping more by sea requires new liquefaction plants which take time to build and need sophisticated tech. Rystad Energy, a consultancy, forecasts that Russia\u2019s gas sales will dwindle to 136bn cubic metres (bcm) in 2023 from 241bcm in 2021.**\n\n>**Oil, however, is more fungible. In December the eu, which in 2021 bought more than 40% of Russia\u2019s crude exports, imposed an import ban. It also forbade its shipping firms, insurers and financiers from facilitating the sale of Russian crude to buyers in other countries unless the price per barrel was below $60.

That month Russia shipped 3.7m barrels a day (b/d) on average, more than it did in 2021. March was also a strong month for sales of refined products such as diesel. A new ecosystem of shadow traders and shippers, largely based in Hong Kong and Dubai, has emerged to help ferry the embargoed barrels to their new destinations, often with the help of Russian lenders and insurers.

Russia would need a price of well over $100 a barrel to balance its budget, analysts estimate. The International Energy Agency, a watchdog, reckons Russia\u2019s oil revenues were 43% lower in March than a year earlier. Economists expect the country\u2019s current-account surplus to fall to 3-4% of gdp this year, in line with the average of the 2010s.**\n\n>Lower hydrocarbon sales mean lower government revenues.

New trading partners have sprung up to replace the West. China now sells twice as much to Russia as it did in 2019. \u201cParallel\u201d imports\u2014unauthorised sales from the West to Russia via a third country of everything from fizzy drinks to computer chips\u2014have soared. In 2022 imports from the eu to Armenia mysteriously doubled, even as Armenian exports to Russia tripled. Serbia\u2019s exports of phones to Russia rose from $8,518 in 2021 to $37m in 2022. Shipments of washing machines from Kazakhstan to Russia rose from zero in 2021 to nearly 100,000 units last year.</p>\n\n<p><strong>These arrangements have drawbacks. Russia\u2019s economic hubs are nearer to Brussels than to Beijing. Higher transport costs mean higher prices. People also have less choice than before (one Muscovite complains about the difficulty of finding mortadella). According to a recent survey by Romir, a Russian market-research firm, two-thirds of Russians reckon the quality of the products they buy is deteriorating.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>What is more, not all goods can be obtained in sufficient quantities through backchannels. Many Russian-made medications, which depend on imported raw materials, are in short supply. The car industry, meanwhile, is struggling with a shortage of imported semiconductors. Production was down 70% in January-February, compared with the same period a year before.</strong>&#39;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Yet even if Russia cannot make as many cars any more, it can still import them. After Lada, a Soviet stalwart, the most popular brand in Russia is now Haval, a mid-range Chinese marque. Its monthly sales have increased 331% over the past year.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Russia also seems to be getting hold of the parts it needs to keep its civilian planes airborne, somehow. Hackers have been stealing updates of aircraft software that Russian firms can no longer buy. Crashes, although frequent by Western standards, have not increased.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The impact of sanctions on Russia\u2019s exports has been bigger\u2013but Western countries always shied away from making them too severe for fear of pushing up energy prices for their own consumers to unbearable levels. The eu\u2019s imports of Russian gas have fallen dramatically. Russia has limited capacity to divert the exports to China, since the pipeline linking the two countries is small. Shipping more by sea requires new liquefaction plants which take time to build and need sophisticated tech. Rystad Energy, a consultancy, forecasts that Russia\u2019s gas sales will dwindle to 136bn cubic metres (bcm) in 2023 from 241bcm in 2021.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Oil, however, is more fungible. In December the eu, which in 2021 bought more than 40% of Russia\u2019s crude exports, imposed an import ban. It also forbade its shipping firms, insurers and financiers from facilitating the sale of Russian crude to buyers in other countries unless the price per barrel was below $60.

Our best guess, based on comparing actual spending figures with what was budgeted before the war, is that Russia\u2019s assault on Ukraine is currently costing it about 5trn roubles a year, or 3% of gdp\u2013less than America spent on the Korean war.\n\n>**But replacing damaged weapons and spent munitions is not simply a question of money. Russia has churned through military equipment on a vast scale. Estimates of the number of armoured vehicles destroyed during the war, for example, range between 8,000 and 16,000, according to a recent report by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (csis), a think-tank. Russia has also lost lots of aircraft, drones and artillery systems.**\n\n>**One solution is to fall back on existing stocks, although many of these are old and in poor repair. Another is to redirect weapons intended for export to the front line. Siemon Wezeman of sipri, a Swedish think-tank, reckons Russia\u2019s arms exports plummeted from $50bn in 2021 to $11bn or less last year. He points out that unusual t-90 tanks\u2014perhaps demonstration models, or units originally destined for Algeria\u2014have been spotted on the battlefield in Ukraine.**\n\n> **Russia is also trying to make more weapons. Dmitri Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia\u2019s security council, recently said the country would produce 1,500 modern tanks in 2023. Officials have also said they want drones to be manufactured en masse in Russia. Some factories are working around the clock. The government is lending lavishly to arms manufacturers, or ordering banks to do so. In January and February production of \u201cfinished metal goods\u201d was 20% higher than the year before, according to official statistics.**\n\n> **The problem is that, to manufacture advanced weapons, it needs access to Western-made, high-end \u201cdual-use\u201d components, from engines to microchips, that are hard to obtain because of Western sanctions. Desperately needed parts can always be diverted to their most urgent use. Thus in February the government temporarily stopped accepting applications for biometric passports to save microchips. High-end washing machines are also being imported in large numbers to be stripped of their chips, presumably for use in guided missiles and other military kit. Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence recently reported that every month Russia manages to make around 30 Kh-101s and 20 Kalibrs, its two main types of guided missile, presumably thanks to such ruses.**\n\n> **But the volumes of advanced weaponry produced is nowhere near what Russia needs to replace its depleting stocks. Ukrainian and Western military officials believe that Russia has used most of its stocks of its most accurate guided missiles. Serial numbers found in the wreckage of spent missiles suggest it is now using new ones, made during the war. Insiders say the army is asking for ten times more tanks than Russia\u2019s factories can produce. A lack of software and technical equipment also seems to be preventing Russia\u2019s production of drones from taking off.**\n\n> **What Russia lacks in quality, however, it may partly compensate for in quantity\u2014by gussying up Soviet-era weapons. It is modernising perhaps 90 old tanks a month by equipping them with new electronics and communication systems. It is refurbishing old missiles that are less accurate but difficult to intercept and repurposing nuclear delivery systems to launch them. It is cannibalising civilian planes to repair fighter jets. Russia is also getting military supplies from allies. Some artillery shells appear to be arriving from China, via Belarus. Russia is also buying (ostensibly civilian) drones from its eastern neighbour, as well as artillery shells from North Korea. It reportedly also traded 60 Su-35 aircraft with Iran in exchange for several thousand kamikaze drones. In short, the quality of Russian weapons is declining, but it has found ways to avoid running out.**\n\n>**Finding enough people to keep the war effort going is another challenge. Many have been killed in action; many more have emigrated. In the year to December 2022 the number of employed Russians under the age of 35 fell by 1.3m, according to FinExpertiza, an auditor. Shortages of workers are common. In December the central bank said that half of firms surveyed were struggling to find enough staff. There are 2.5 vacancies for every unemployed person, making the Russian labour market twice as tight as America\u2019s. Wages are growing fast. Specialists, such as IT engineers and lawyers, are especially scarce. At a recent meeting of Russia\u2019s entrepreneurs union, the labour shortage was the main topic of conversation.**\n \n>**The labour shortage makes life difficult for military recruiters, too. The army is now sending conscription and mobilisation notices by email, in addition to physical copies, to make it harder for people to pretend they have not seen them. Draftees are not allowed to leave the country. With enough coercion, though, Russia should have no trouble filling its ranks. The country is not about to run out of young men: before the war there were about 17m of them. But more people on the frontline means fewer people in offices and factories. And the more widespread conscription becomes in big cities like Moscow and Saint Petersburg, the greater the chance of popular unrest.**\n\n>**The government\u2019s third economic achievement has been to maintain living standards. Last year it spent an extra 3% of gdp to stimulate the economy. Aside from higher spending on the military, support is coming in the form of economic aid to civilian companies: direct handouts to firms, subsidised loans, joint investments and so on. Spending on the budget category that subsumes many of these items, \u201cnational economy\u201d, rose by 20% in 2022, to 4.3trn roubles. Between January and mid-March it increased by another 45% compared with the same period last year. Banks are being asked to give indebted firms breathing room. In 2022 business failures fell to a seven-year low.**\n\n> **Last year \u201csocial\u201d spending also rose, from 6trn to 7trn roubles (4.5% of gdp). However, says Vladimir Milov, a former deputy minister of energy, the federal government accounts for only part of overall social spending. The pension fund\u2014a nominally independent agency recently renamed the Social Fund\u2014is also doling out cash to retirees, mothers, the disabled and more, as are regional governments. Allowances towards constituencies important to Mr Putin, such as families with more than one child, the poor and the elderly, are growing, notes Maria Snegovaya of csis. Outside Moscow, payments to the families of dead conscripts can be enough to buy a flat.**\n\n>**All this may explain why the war has not affected Russian living standards all that much. Consumer prices did rise by 12% last year, in large part because of a depreciation of the rouble in the spring. Average pay at medium-sized and large companies, which include many state-owned entities, rose marginally last year even after accounting for inflation. The value of people\u2019s savings has fallen only slightly, central-bank statistics suggest. Inflation fell back to 3.5% in March.**",

The men squeezed past one another down a shoulder-width dirt corridor lit with LED strips, staring at tablet computers showing a live drone feed of the terrain outside. Blast waves from artillery shells and rockets shook the bunker, and a radio crackled with a warning of incoming Russian helicopters.\n\nBut the soldiers were focused on their screens, specifically on a line of Russian troops and heavy equipment dug in a short distance away and marked with red plus signs.\n\nThat would be their target.\n\n\u201cThe guys dug all this by hand, and they want to fight, they want to shoot,\u201d said the unit commander, a 32-year-old with a braided ponytail who uses the call sign Shuler. \u201cWe just want to kick them off our land, that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nThe fighting here is intensely personal. Most of the soldiers of the 110th Brigade come from areas now occupied by Russia. Shuler\u2019s unit was forced to retreat in the early days of the war, which began in February 2022, and his parents remain in occupied Melitopol, roughly 80 miles from the bunker.\n\nOver the past year, they have slowly turned the tide, halting the Russian advance and building a network of defensive positions that the Russian military, for all its superiority in weaponry and numbers, has been unable to crack.\n\n\u201cWe really know this location \u2014 every bush,\u201d said Col. Oleksandr Ihnatiev, a veteran of Ukraine\u2019s special operations forces who took command of the brigade in April last year. \u201cFrom the beginning of the war, we in our strip have not lost one position or post.\u201d\n\nA military push by Ukraine in the Zaporizhzhia region makes strategic sense, military officials and experts say. By punching south through the Russian lines and driving hard toward the Sea of Azov, Ukraine\u2019s military could split Russian forces in half, severing important supply lines and dealing a blow to the war aims of Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin.\n\nA history teacher before the invasion, Shuler views the looming fight within a broader context. He wears a patch with a Star of David on his arm, a reminder of his great-grandparents who died in the Holocaust. His Jewish grandfather had to change his name to sound more Russian when the Soviets took control of his native western Ukraine at the end of World War II.\n\nNow, Shuler must hide his face, refusing to be photographed for fear that his parents could suffer reprisals from the occupiers.\n\n\u201cImagine the situation, you\u2019re alive, but your life has been taken away,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have nowhere to return to if we don\u2019t stop this, if we don\u2019t end it, if we don\u2019t win.\u201d\n\nShuler complained that their Iranian weapon, which he believed had been confiscated by the United States and delivered to Ukraine, was less accurate than Western-built models. And the Pakistani and Soviet-era shells they have in their arsenal, while sufficient in quantity, at times failed to detonate.\n\nStill, the 110th Brigade is in far better shape than it had been at the start of the war, when it had only about 100 men to fight the Russian forces who poured into the Zaporizhzhia region from Crimea after Mr. Putin announced the invasion.\n\nA young battalion commander with the brigade who uses the call sign Polyak said he and his men initially had nothing but shovels to defend themselves with. \u201cThe first day, we had to move like caterpillars,\u201d Polyak said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t even stand up; the Grads were never ending. And gradually, we crawled and crawled and crawled.\u201d\n\nColonel Ihnatiev, the brigade\u2019s commander, said his men alone had killed more than 900 Russian soldiers in more than a year of fighting and had destroyed some 150 armored vehicles. The 110th Brigade, he said, now has several thousand soldiers, the majority of whom had never touched a weapon before the war began.\n\n\u201cIt was not easy,\u201d Colonel Ihnatiev said. \u201cThere was a lot of crying and whining, but we were able to mold the tears and the snot into character.\u201d\n\nTo press forward in any counteroffensive, he said, his men would need additional armor and reinforcements from other units. Some of that aid has already begun to arrive.\n\nThe incoming shells howled overhead, their explosions getting closer and closer as Russian troops stationed about a mile away adjusted their cannon\u2019s trajectory.\n\nBut the Ukrainian artillery team positioned to return fire was unfazed. The men joked as they loaded shells into their Australian-made howitzer in the shade of a cherry tree, swatting away bees that hummed around its white spring blooms. They fired. And fired again.\n\nAfter the fifth round, the Russian side fell silent.\n\nThese Ukrainian soldiers are part of an elite, British-trained artillery unit attached to an airborne assault brigade. A month ago, they were stationed near Bakhmut burning through a thousand shells a week as they mowed down waves of Russian infantry. And before that, they took part in the liberation of Kherson.\n\nGiven their skills and experience, it was puzzling to some of them why they were sent to this corner of the war.\n\n\u201cMaybe it is connected with our offensive. Maybe it is a distraction maneuver,\u201d said a junior sergeant with the unit, named Maksim, who goes by the call sign Stayer. \u201cWe don\u2019t see the whole picture.\u201d\n\nThe Russian military clearly believes that the Zaporizhzhia region is critical to the war. After a winter hiatus, Russian forces have begun to pound Ukrainian military positions, as well as cities and towns, with an array of weaponry, including artillery shells, guided missiles and Iranian-made explosive drones. This could be a sign that Russian forces are preparing for their own assault \u2014 or anticipating a Ukrainian one.\n\nStayer, 39, said his men were ready for more action.\n\n\u201cWhen there\u2019s an offensive, there\u2019s movement, it\u2019s fun,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re shooting at them, they\u2019re shooting at you.\u201d\n\nIn Bakhmut, there was never even time to sleep, Stayer said. The muck and fatigue of battle had so changed his appearance that his iPhone\u2019s face recognition system ceased to work for a bit, he said. Inside his phone was a horror show: drone photographs of fields littered with Russian bodies blown apart by the mortars his team had fired at them.",

This was posted close to the end of the megathread so I'll post the article here with my reply from yesterday as well.\n\nI think this topic is particularly relevant when we are discussing who really has the edge in terms of a protracted war, especially from the economic point of view.\n\n[Pawn shops and bread queues: poverty grips Ukraine as war drags on](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/30/ukraine-war-poverty-irpin-pawn-shops-bread-queues)\n\n>People turn to handouts and pawning goods as Kyiv\u2019s bustling bars belie reality of life in wartime for many  \n>  \n>In the Treasure pawn shop in Kyiv, Oleksandra, 40, a well turned out woman in a hooded wool coat and Nike trainers, has come to redeem her sewing machines. Like all those visiting the store, she does not want to give her family name.She says that when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, she was working as an accountant for a firm that employed 14 people, who were all laid off because of the conflict. Since then she has struggled to find regular work. With savings running out, like many others in Kyiv, she turned to pawning her possessions to get by, only finding a job a year later that allowed her to claim back her machines.As Oleksandra leaves clutching her belongings, save for a mobile phone she has decided not to redeem, the cashier, Oleksandr Stepanov, remarks from behind his hardened glass window that on a busy day the shop can get 50 people coming in to surrender mobile phones and household appliances.Those who can afford it, he says, will come back to get their goods within two weeks. Almost half, he adds, will not, leaving Treasure to sell on the items from a back room with displays of phones and watches. \u201cPeople are struggling because of the war. They don\u2019t have money.\u201d Many have lost their jobs, he says, while prices have skyrocketed even for those who have jobs.The scene in the pawn shop illustrates the crisis of growing poverty in Ukraine, the reality of which stands in contrast to the surface bustle of Kyiv\u2019s busy restaurants and bars where it is often hard to get a table, with many living a precarious existence.Poverty increased from 5.5% to 24.2% in Ukraine in 2022, pushing 7.1 million more people into poverty with the worst impact out of sight in rural villages, according to a recent report by the World Bank. With unemployment unofficially at 36% and inflation hitting 26.6% at the end of 2022, the institution\u2019s regional country director for eastern Europe, Arup Banerji, had warned that poverty could soar.Behind his window in Treasure, Stepanov describes the hardships experienced even by those who have work. \u201cThe price of everything has gone up. Food is the most expensive and then it is fuel for the car. Some things have gone up by 40-50%. Before the war my wife would go to the supermarket to shop and it would cost 200 hryvnia, now the same shop costs 400-500.\u201dFor those in the most difficult circumstances that has meant relying on handouts, no matter how small. In the town of Irpin just outside Kyiv, where heavy fighting took place at the beginning of the war as Russian armoured columns attempted to take the capital, the wrecked bridge that was used as an escape route by fleeing refugees is being rebuilt.  \n>  \n>Elsewhere damaged buildings are being repaired, cranes and work crews busy. But while the ground war long ago receded from Irpin, the economic consequences of conflict are still being felt sharply in a town where the population has been swelled by internally displaced fleeing the frontlines in the south and east.  \n>  \n>The most visible sign of the poverty crisis can be found at a protestant church in the town where priests have set up six distribution centres for free bread across the area, the busiest in Irpin itself. There, on most days, about 500 people can be found queuing for a free loaf, with tables and a tent also set up outside the centre on the day the Guardian visits, offering free secondhand shoes, clothes and children\u2019s toys.  \n>  \n>One resident of Irpin, Veronika Pravyk is looking through the clothes and trying to find free nappies and baby milk for her toddler, which are sometimes available but not today. She tells a typical story. Working in retail before the war, the 30-year-old lost her job and fled with her family to Spain for six months where she burned through her savings before returning to Ukraine in the autumn.  \n>  \n>\u201cI\u2019m not working but my husband is,\u201d she says. \u201cBut all the prices have gone up because of the war and my husband\u2019s salary buys less than it used to because of the falling exchange rate with the dollar. We still have to find the money to pay for our apartment and to heat it during this past winter. I just never imagined we would be living like this. Before the war we managed everything. It\u2019s very difficult and everyone is suffering the same.\u201d  \n>  \n>In his office in the church, the pastor, Vitali Kolesnyk, who organised the bread distribution, which takes place five days a week, with his colleague Vasyli Ostriy, describes the situation in Irpin. One of the biggest private employers, he says, was a wood carving business with a workforce of 400 spread across three sites, but its factories were badly damaged during the fighting.  \n>  \n>It relocated to western Ukraine and as a consequence the workers in Irpin were made redundant. \u201cA lot of people are ready to work for peanuts here,\u201d he says. \u201cThe salaries are already less \\[than they were\\]. But people will do anything to earn some money.\u201d  \n>  \n>While he says that some of those coming for bread are internally displaced, he offers an anecdote that describes how people are trying to manage their dwindling resources. \u201cYou see some people come in cars for a free loaf of bread that would cost $1. That gives you an idea of how carefully people are watching every penny spend. We talk and pray with people about what is going on. They talk about the economy and tell us how hard it has become.\u201d  \n>  \n>The economist Olena Bilan sees a deepening crisis, but says that without a huge package of financial support from the international community, including pledges worth $43bn (\u00a334bn), the situation would be worse.  \n>  \n>\u201cWe\u2019ve seen GDP decline by 30% in large part because Ukraine exports 80% of its goods through ports it no longer has access too. We\u2019ve had inflation of 26% \u2013 again which could have been worse \u2013 but people\u2019s salaries have also been flat and the currency has devalued against the dollar by 20%. The biggest challenge is going to be how to create new jobs.\u201d  \n>  \n>In Irpin, the long queue, snaking under the trees, to pick up loaves imprinted with the word \u201cvictory\u201d is thinning. At one of the clothes stalls, a church volunteer, Larysa Kuzhel, 58, is not optimistic.  \n>  \n>\u201cI think it is going to get more difficult especially for the younger people. The pensioners who you see here get support. It\u2019s only $50 a month but it is something. But it is the younger people who have lost their jobs who are really suffering.\u201d",

They don\u2019t have money.\u201d Many have lost their jobs, he says, while prices have skyrocketed even for those who have jobs.The scene in the pawn shop illustrates the crisis of growing poverty in Ukraine, the reality of which stands in contrast to the surface bustle of Kyiv\u2019s busy restaurants and bars where it is often hard to get a table, with many living a precarious existence.Poverty increased from 5.5% to 24.2% in Ukraine in 2022, pushing 7.1 million more people into poverty with the worst impact out of sight in rural villages, according to a recent report by the World Bank. With unemployment unofficially at 36% and inflation hitting 26.6% at the end of 2022, the institution\u2019s regional country director for eastern Europe, Arup Banerji, had warned that poverty could soar.Behind his window in Treasure, Stepanov describes the hardships experienced even by those who have work. \u201cThe price of everything has gone up. Food is the most expensive and then it is fuel for the car. Some things have gone up by 40-50%. Before the war my wife would go to the supermarket to shop and it would cost 200 hryvnia, now the same shop costs 400-500.\u201dFor those in the most difficult circumstances that has meant relying on handouts, no matter how small. In the town of Irpin just outside Kyiv, where heavy fighting took place at the beginning of the war as Russian armoured columns attempted to take the capital, the wrecked bridge that was used as an escape route by fleeing refugees is being rebuilt.  </p>\n\n<p>Elsewhere damaged buildings are being repaired, cranes and work crews busy. But while the ground war long ago receded from Irpin, the economic consequences of conflict are still being felt sharply in a town where the population has been swelled by internally displaced fleeing the frontlines in the south and east.  </p>\n\n<p>The most visible sign of the poverty crisis can be found at a protestant church in the town where priests have set up six distribution centres for free bread across the area, the busiest in Irpin itself. There, on most days, about 500 people can be found queuing for a free loaf, with tables and a tent also set up outside the centre on the day the Guardian visits, offering free secondhand shoes, clothes and children\u2019s toys.  </p>\n\n<p>One resident of Irpin, Veronika Pravyk is looking through the clothes and trying to find free nappies and baby milk for her toddler, which are sometimes available but not today. She tells a typical story. Working in retail before the war, the 30-year-old lost her job and fled with her family to Spain for six months where she burned through her savings before returning to Ukraine in the autumn.  </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not working but my husband is,\u201d she says. \u201cBut all the prices have gone up because of the war and my husband\u2019s salary buys less than it used to because of the falling exchange rate with the dollar. We still have to find the money to pay for our apartment and to heat it during this past winter. I just never imagined we would be living like this. Before the war we managed everything. It\u2019s very difficult and everyone is suffering the same.\u201d  </p>\n\n<p>In his office in the church, the pastor, Vitali Kolesnyk, who organised the bread distribution, which takes place five days a week, with his colleague Vasyli Ostriy, describes the situation in Irpin. One of the biggest private employers, he says, was a wood carving business with a workforce of 400 spread across three sites, but its factories were badly damaged during the fighting.  </p>\n\n<p>It relocated to western Ukraine and as a consequence the workers in Irpin were made redundant. \u201cA lot of people are ready to work for peanuts here,\u201d he says. \u201cThe salaries are already less [than they were]. But people will do anything to earn some money.\u201d  </p>\n\n<p>While he says that some of those coming for bread are internally displaced, he offers an anecdote that describes how people are trying to manage their dwindling resources. \u201cYou see some people come in cars for a free loaf of bread that would cost $1. That gives you an idea of how carefully people are watching every penny spend. We talk and pray with people about what is going on. They talk about the economy and tell us how hard it has become.\u201d  </p>\n\n<p>The economist Olena Bilan sees a deepening crisis, but says that without a huge package of financial support from the international community, including pledges worth $43bn (\u00a334bn), the situation would be worse.  </p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve seen GDP decline by 30% in large part because Ukraine exports 80% of its goods through ports it no longer has access too. We\u2019ve had inflation of 26% \u2013 again which could have been worse \u2013 but people\u2019s salaries have also been flat and the currency has devalued against the dollar by 20%. The biggest challenge is going to be how to create new jobs.\u201d  </p>\n\n<p>In Irpin, the long queue, snaking under the trees, to pick up loaves imprinted with the word \u201cvictory\u201d is thinning. At one of the clothes stalls, a church volunteer, Larysa Kuzhel, 58, is not optimistic.  </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI think it is going to get more difficult especially for the younger people. The pensioners who you see here get support. It\u2019s only $50 a month but it is something. But it is the younger people who have lost their jobs who are really suffering.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

As long as Ukraine is poorer than Russia it is no threat in the sense that you highlight. Ukraine is much poorer than Russia and Ukrainians have been regularly emigrating to Russia to find work. The wealth gap was such that it would take Ukraine a few decades to bridge it at double-digit growth rates *and* Russia stagnating.\n\nAnd that was before the war and the destruction of large parts of Ukraine.\n\nIn other words, Ukraine as a well-off democracy cannot be a temptation for an average Russian as long as it remains poorer than Russia.

If by decisive military defeat you mean that Russia will be pushed back to either 2022 or 1991 borders, I agree that is a noble goal we should all root for and I hope Ukraine manages to pull it of. But I don't think it is decisive in regards to deterring Russia from trying again in 10-15 years from now, absent Western security guarantees including direct military intervention.\n\nThe only type of 'decisive' military victory which will guarantee beyond a shadow of a doubt that Russia will not attempt another invasion is a 1945 Nazi Germany scenario where foreign troops march into Moscow and Putin and his cronies will be the defendants in a Nuremberg style trial. While that is a scenario I would absolutely love to see, everyone tethered to reality knows that is practically unachievable for a host of purposes.\n\nAny resolution short of what I described above will be a compromise. The question remains how much of a compromise will Ukraine and its Western backers be willing to make.\n\nB) There's no reason to believe that does guarantees are unreachable as part of a negotiation, regardless of whether Russia is pushed back to Feb 2022 lines or not. One can envision a peace treaty where Ukraine does make certain territorial concessions and Russia agrees to a peace treaty where Ukraine's territorial integrity is backed by the Western powers with guarantees of direct military intervention.",

What made him a genius was that even when he was losing, he preserved the military under his command so he could keep fighting. He just outlasted the British, with a bit of help from the French.

People consistently and conveniently express their opinions on all matters regarding Ukraine, from Euromaidan to language policies. However, when it comes to this issue, the answer is undoubtedly the same: It's for Ukrainians to decide.\n\nNow, do not get me wrong, in a perfect world, I would agree. It's Ukraine, it's their land, and they should get to decide. But there are inherently so many issues associated with this once you actually ponder about it. When last year a poll showed that 80 or 90% want to continue fighting until Crimea is recaptured, and also a huge proportion thought the war would end in a few months. The absolute majority thought it would end by the end of 2022. Freedom of speech and press have significantly deteriorated over the past year, and it wasn't in a good position before the war either. Propaganda is at a maximum level too. These are a few issues to consider when you reflect on it.\r  \n\r  \nNow, that doesn't mean I support your endeavor in questioning if it's the right move to fight on. No, I just think most answers here are easy rebuttals, albeit sometimes lengthy ones, that are ultimately flawed.\r  \n\r  \nLet's imagine just a hypothetical scenario: Ukraine's counteroffensive is about to begin. They are immensely successful with few losses, completely break the spirit of Russia, and liberate a lot of territory, including the land bridge. The war ends within half a year, and within a decade, Ukraine is well on its path to the EU, and Russia allows them to join NATO. All's well that ends well, so to speak.\r  \n\r  \nNow, let's imagine the Ukrainian leadership evaluates the same. But what if the Ukrainian people decide, enough is enough? Ukraine is the people - not the land - and even before the counteroffensive ends, they decide to end the war. I can reverse this scenario so much so that the war ends disastrously for Ukraine.\r  \n\r  \nThe thing I want to say is, without holding all the cards, how can you play? How can you decide? Ukrainians don't have all the cards. They don't know. How would their opinion be if they had all the cards? It's what I have said about Maidan. Would you go through with it if you knew what would come? Most Ukrainians in 2019 wouldn't.\r  \n\r  \nI say it's a cop-out answer also because I think the majority on Reddit do not want Ukraine to ever stop this war until Russia is kicked out 100%. I feel a lot of people would be disappointed even if the war would end at all. It's popcorn for some. Not throwing shade, not my intention, but that's the vibe I get.\r  \n\r  \nSo when people say here, already knowing the poll results - Ukrainians want to continue the war - they effectively answer your question with: \"Continue the war.\"\r  \n\r  \nAnd still, I just want to underline that doesn't mean I think Ukraine should all of a sudden quit now. In fact, I think as long as Ukraine is on a winning streak, maybe they shouldn't stop. Once they start losing on the battlefield, or other significant shifts such as Western support changing, well then we can talk. Because then maybe the people who have all the cards are now making poor decisions. But until now, the people have made good decisions.
