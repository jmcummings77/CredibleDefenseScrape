It's hard to say whether Russians were simply thrown off balance by the push towards Verbove (they've definitely had to deploy some of their local reserves to the area, at least according to few updates from DeepState over the last couple of weeks) or whether this is a deliberate shift in tactics on the part of UAF, but my subjective feeling is that something certainly changed in this sector, especially towards Robotyne - I've seen an uptick in UA footage of tactical artillery strikes, relatively deep reach of Ukrainian ISR assets, even FPV drones striking at what I believe should be their maximum effective range especially in such a contested environment, and I guess there was also the confirmed instance of Ka-52 being brought down. All these things happen all over the battlefield in the south, but with the concentration of Russian countermeasures around this sector (remember, this is one out of just 3 axes that Ukraine invested considerable efforts in, so Russians are able to draw considerable resources to countering UAF in this area) it surprises me how much footage tricked in over the last seven or so days - but it's certainly far from an objective indicator, it could be just Ukraine being less tight-lipped. And to be clear none of this points to an easier time going (potentially) forward beyond Robotyne.\n\nThat being said, the push towards Verbove couple of weeks ago was a failure and I suspect given the topography (the road from Robotyne towards Verbove, including Verbove itself, lies in a valley - I also suspect this was one of the reasons behind this area apparently being mined a lot less extensively) that the push was probably designed to achieve a lot more (possibly reaching operational depth, but I don't really see any immediate objectives that would allow for this to be significant and there have been various theories floating about in UA-affiliated circles as to what went wrong so it's hard to grasp what their actual plan was) given how costly it would be in short-to-medium term to get stuck between two Russian-held high grounds, and Russians have amply demonstrated their willingness to defend areas even with their GLOGs being seriously challenged. I believe Ukraine is currently (amongst other things) trying to storm the heights to the north of the Robotyne-Verbove road which offers a nice overview over the road as well as over the highway towards Polohy and if they are successful I believe they might also want to try and revisit their probing attacks towards Novopokrovka in more force (settlement just north of the highway, which I believe will be much more vulnerable if the heights south of it are taken and an additional couple of clicks of the highway eastwards is secured - don't conflate it with a similarly named settlement just south of Robotyne Novoprokopivka). Couple of weeks ago, u/Larelli had some [insights](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/15g71n2/comment/juhff19/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) into UAF units in that direction. The whole Polohy sector (essentially from Robotyne to Novozlatopil) was mostly untested by UA ground forces over the last 2 months (see u/Larelli's reference to it in his [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/15lg6q9/credibledefense_daily_megathread_august_08_2023/jvd0oia/?context=3)), I've only seen evidence of sporadic probing attacks aimed at areas around Novopokrovka, Dorozhianka (some very minimal gains around the railway just west of it that both sides reported on back then, for whatever reason) and Marfopil, so it's impossible to say how well this sector is manned (given the attrition rates caused by mostly artillery in this sector) and whether Russians are keeping sufficient local reserves as a precaution, but I'd imagine they are definitely threading on the more cautious side. Still, I think it would be prudent to try and put additional pressure in that direction.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for Urozhaine, yesterday NoelReports [posted](https://mstdn.social/@noelreports/110861524474331738) a geolocated footage of a Ukrainian tank striking at positions in the northern side of the village and today he [posted](https://twitter.com/noelreports/status/1689546662887186433?s=46) a drone video which shows some UAF infantrymen fighting and taking what looks like small arms fire in the centre of the settlement. Although, if Russians are as stubborn as they have been in this sector (Staromaiorske, Makarivka, Rivnopil, etc.) I'd imagine we are still possibly a few days off Ukraine announcing the liberation of the settlement.",

I was quoting the Centre for Defence Strategies. \n\nI was wrong about Novodonetske, I \"gotta hand it\" to the Russians. I was skeptical they would have pulled back on that line by late July, but I was very upbeat that Novodonetske would have fallen within the past week. Mainly because of the fact that the density of Russian forces in that area is smaller than in the rest of the sector, the fact that Kermenchyk is much more defensible being situated on heights, and the opinion of some Ukrainian analysts who still take it for granted that the 36th Army is not going to touch the 5th Tank Brigade at all for the actions in Novodonetske, i.e. the formation currently in the rear and deputed to the defense of Kermenchyk together with the 131st Regiment of the 1st Corps...\n\nIn any case I would have expected such settlement to fall before Urozhayne. Although according to the Ukrainians the 60th Brigade in Urozhayne is in worse shape than the 37th in Novodonetske. I've read today from Mashovets that a battalion of the 125th Brigade (1st Corps) has been deployed in Novodonetske to assist the 37th, which means they have clearly casualties, although at the moment the village is holding out. It's likely that the Russians want to keep holding out until the forces in the village are completely depleted or until the Ukrainians get dangerously close to the road between Novodonetske and Kermenchyk. \n\nProbably the little recent Ukrainian progress can be explained by the operational pause between late July and early August, which may have been caused by the potential deployment to the Svatove sector of units of the 68th Jager Brigade from the eastern bank of the Mokri Yaly (if confirmed of course - we have no actual evidence at the present) and the possible withdrawal due to losses of the 23rd Mech from the western bank (also to be confirmed). For the Ukrainians, however, several groups of the Russian 305th Artillery Brigade have been withdrawn due to losses from counter-battery fire. This brigade fields very heavy calibers, e.g. 203mm howitzers and 240mm mortars.",

I&#39;ve read today from Mashovets that a battalion of the 125th Brigade (1st Corps) has been deployed in Novodonetske to assist the 37th, which means they have clearly casualties, although at the moment the village is holding out. It&#39;s likely that the Russians want to keep holding out until the forces in the village are completely depleted or until the Ukrainians get dangerously close to the road between Novodonetske and Kermenchyk. </p>\n\n<p>Probably the little recent Ukrainian progress can be explained by the operational pause between late July and early August, which may have been caused by the potential deployment to the Svatove sector of units of the 68th Jager Brigade from the eastern bank of the Mokri Yaly (if confirmed of course - we have no actual evidence at the present) and the possible withdrawal due to losses of the 23rd Mech from the western bank (also to be confirmed). For the Ukrainians, however, several groups of the Russian 305th Artillery Brigade have been withdrawn due to losses from counter-battery fire. This brigade fields very heavy calibers, e.g. 203mm howitzers and 240mm mortars.</p>\n</div>",

That&#39;s especially true in the House, where Republican leaders are dealing with razor-thin margins and many conservatives vehemently opposed to passing a temporary funding patch that doesn&#39;t enact steep spending cuts or GOP policy priorities.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Key context on emergency cash</strong>: Congress has provided Ukraine with about $43 billion since Russia first invaded the country. This request could also replenish Pentagon inventories after the U.S. sends a promised $1 billion in weapons to Taiwan. The Biden administration last month announced the first tranche of weapons for Taiwan valued at $345 million.</p>\n\n<p>For months, the head of FEMA has also warned lawmakers that the U.S. is on track to deplete its disaster aid fund before additional cash comes in when the new fiscal year begins in October.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

The article repeats what we have read over and over again in the recent weeks. An interesting part is about training in NATO countries being constrained by safety concerns and an attempt at combined arms training being carried out in Ukraine by Ukrainian trainers. Probably the only battalions to have received some combined arms training in the West are those fielding Bradleys or Strykers. The brigade is made up of mobilized - so no news on this subject. They have been trained in the Western countries with the typical 5-weeks basic and concentrated course. I think then we have to add to that the combined arms training in Ukraine. The Achilles' heel of the training is demining.\n\nAnother point is the presence of this brigade, or at least a battalion from it, in the second line near Kupyansk. This would confirm what u/offogredux had written a few days ago, i.e. that there were battalions of the new 41/43/44th Mech Brigades deployed in the rear between Kupyansk and Kreminna, in addition to the 42nd Brigade that we know has been reported in the Kreminna sector for weeks. In recent weeks in particular, the Kupyansk sector has received very large amount of reserves. Rybar also recently reported units of the 68th Jager Brigade being active around Karmazynivka, near Svatove, in the sector of the 66th Mech Brigade that had been affected by the Russian advance of July 20/21 that was later contained. As usual, take his words with a pinch of salt - there is no official confirmation. In the first weeks of the offensive in the South the 68th was very important in clearing territory in the eastern bank of the Mokri Yaly River - it would be strange for the Ukrainians to have pulled out a brigade from the most promising front of the offensive - but then again it must be said that very recently the 38th Marine Brigade was seen in action in the sector where the 68th Brigade was active.\n\nYesterday I had written that the number of Ukrainian troops between Kupyansk and Kreminna had probably almost doubled compared to 3 months ago, but I might even have been a bit too restrained. It has to be said there are rumors that elements of the 21st Mech Brigade and a battalion of the 67th Brigade may have been transferred to the northern sector of Bakhmut from that of Kreminna. Which could be good news because it might mean that the Ukrainians consider the Russians as not so dangerous in that specific sector, arguably the quietest right now among the three main directions. I remain convinced that there are more Ukrainian troops concentrated around those directions than between Kamyanske and Velyka Novosilka, despite a considerable portion of them being from second-rate mechanized brigades or TDF.",

However, like many previous wars, they are not who were chosen to do the training, which is a different story altogether. </p>\n\n<p>Those were chosen 1) Aren&#39;t actually trained properly as trainers 2) Generally aren&#39;t subject matter experts 3) Don&#39;t speak the language (and anyone who tries to sell the idea that quality instruction can be done in large groups with one interpreter is full of s**t). 4) Are given an EXTREMELY abbreviated time period that makes the job impossible 5) Are not allowed to adjust the curriculum that is given to them 6) Usually have no control over who attends and especially who graduates (everyone) 7) Aren&#39;t allowed to administer proper discipline required.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "A few days ago I got into a debate with someone over the effectiveness of sanctions. They were essentially arguing that western sanctions on Russia were ineffective because they haven't yet forced Russia to withdraw from Ukraine (they didn't completely tank the Russian economy in a year). I wasn't planning on bringing up this convo cause it didn't happen on this sub-\n\nHOWEVER, I saw someone yesterday ask something along the lines of \"why is the ruble going down so much now?\" so I figured I'd bring up the core point of my own argument, here, in order to answer such a question.\n\nThe core of my argument is this: sanctions are meant to apply long term pressure on the Russian economy, and the impact of sanctions increases over time. It is unrealistic for people to have expected the Russian economy to collapse within a short time frame after sanctions went into effect.\n\nImagine if a regular person lost their job. They (likely) wouldn't be immediately kicked out of their home. They might be able to rely on savings. They may ask some friends for support. They might go into credit card debt. They'll search for a new job.\n\nBut over time, unless they find a new job, these measures are going to going to become less effective, until they can no longer be utilized at all. Savings will run out. Friends will get tired of offering support. Credit ratings will go down, and debt will become unmanageable. The job search might even become more difficult.\n\nNow, government finances are, of course, far different from the finances of the average person. Governments can leverage a lot of tools in order to essentially \"cheat\" the system compared to a single person (they can bring their own money, after all). However, I think pointing out the financial impact that losing a job might have on a single person, better illustrates the kind of pressure that tough sanctions may put on a government.\n\nRussia is able to rely on its reserves (essentially, savings) for a while. It can rely on support from allies for a bit. It can leverage different economic tools in order to prevent severe economic damage. However, in the long term, it must find a replacement for everything it has lost over sanctions, or else the sanctions will have an increasing negative effect on the Russian economy.\n\nThat negative effect starts off small. You start seeing Russian deficits. You see some troubling signs in the Russian economy - some industries aren't doing as well. The ruble declines a bit. Maybe people leave the country in order to search for better economic prospects. Etc. But over time, these negative effects gain momentum, and they stack on top of each other. Suddenly, the ruble goes from \"manageable\" to declining in value more and more, creating an even bigger problem from the Russian government as they'll have to spend even more money to solve their issues.\n\nThe west helps Ukraine by applying short term pressure on Russia and long term pressure on Russia. Short term pressure takes the form of things like immediate military and financial aid to Ukraine - which makes the job of the Russian military harder. Long term pressure takes the form of sanctions that gradually increase the costliness of maintaining the war effort, slowly deteriorates the Russian economy, etc. Both short term and long term strategies are necessary in order to achieve a victory.\n\nAnyway, yeah, that's all I have to say. If anyone else wants to add anything, feel free. \n\nHopefully all that text was helpful to someone.",

It is unrealistic for people to have expected the Russian economy to collapse within a short time frame after sanctions went into effect.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine if a regular person lost their job. They (likely) wouldn&#39;t be immediately kicked out of their home. They might be able to rely on savings. They may ask some friends for support. They might go into credit card debt. They&#39;ll search for a new job.</p>\n\n<p>But over time, unless they find a new job, these measures are going to going to become less effective, until they can no longer be utilized at all. Savings will run out. Friends will get tired of offering support. Credit ratings will go down, and debt will become unmanageable. The job search might even become more difficult.</p>\n\n<p>Now, government finances are, of course, far different from the finances of the average person. Governments can leverage a lot of tools in order to essentially &quot;cheat&quot; the system compared to a single person (they can bring their own money, after all). However, I think pointing out the financial impact that losing a job might have on a single person, better illustrates the kind of pressure that tough sanctions may put on a government.</p>\n\n<p>Russia is able to rely on its reserves (essentially, savings) for a while. It can rely on support from allies for a bit. It can leverage different economic tools in order to prevent severe economic damage. However, in the long term, it must find a replacement for everything it has lost over sanctions, or else the sanctions will have an increasing negative effect on the Russian economy.</p>\n\n<p>That negative effect starts off small. You start seeing Russian deficits. You see some troubling signs in the Russian economy - some industries aren&#39;t doing as well. The ruble declines a bit. Maybe people leave the country in order to search for better economic prospects. Etc. But over time, these negative effects gain momentum, and they stack on top of each other. Suddenly, the ruble goes from &quot;manageable&quot; to declining in value more and more, creating an even bigger problem from the Russian government as they&#39;ll have to spend even more money to solve their issues.</p>\n\n<p>The west helps Ukraine by applying short term pressure on Russia and long term pressure on Russia. Short term pressure takes the form of things like immediate military and financial aid to Ukraine - which makes the job of the Russian military harder. Long term pressure takes the form of sanctions that gradually increase the costliness of maintaining the war effort, slowly deteriorates the Russian economy, etc. Both short term and long term strategies are necessary in order to achieve a victory.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, yeah, that&#39;s all I have to say. If anyone else wants to add anything, feel free. </p>\n\n<p>Hopefully all that text was helpful to someone.</p>\n</div>",

There's an obvious impact on consumer goods as well. Most of them have indeed been replaced with alternative sources (ranging from parmezan cheese from Argentina to avocados from South Africa), so yes, they haven't disappeared.

It's a form of power signaling which plays into the public's preferences, but it's not entirely without a certain suspension of disbelief, kind of like how people in Britain can signal to each other that they'd like to move some luggage out of the way using nothing but the word \"sorry\" without actually apologising for anything, but also without feeling *completely* anxiety-free.",

            "body": "Sanctions do not directly stop a country from waging a war or pursuing a particular policy. They're meant to cause enough pain to the average citizen that the government will be compelled to reverse course because of pressure from its own citizens. But this rarely if ever works especially among undemocratic governments. These governments will simply tell their citizens we're under attack and sanctions are to blame for our economic ills. In the case of Russia, sanctions are even less likely to succeed for many Russians this is existential war that they can't afford to lose. Fiona Hill, in an interview with Foreign Policy which is on YouTube, said that even Russians in Berlin, where she was during the interview, who opposed the war think Russia cannot afford to lose at this point. So, the prospect of Russia ending this war because of sanctions are slim.\n\nAnother aspect of sanctions people ignore is blowback. Sanctions impact both country sanctioned as well as countries applying the sanctions. The scale and severity of the blowback depends on the relative economic sizes of the countries. The sanctions on Russia led to increased food and energy costs. At the Shangri La Dialogue in June 2023, Joseph Borell [said](https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/singapore-speech-hrvp-borrell-shangri-la-dialogue_en) \"if you include the support that the European governments have had to pay in order to help their families and firms to face the high prices of electricity, of food, **the subsidies to our people in order to face the consequences of the war is \u20ac700 billion** \u2013 ten times more than the support for Ukraine.\" As you can see, while the sanctions definitely hurt Russia, they also hurt the EU as well. Sanctions may be less costly than hot war but they're not cost free.",

In the case of Russia, sanctions are even less likely to succeed for many Russians this is existential war that they can&#39;t afford to lose. Fiona Hill, in an interview with Foreign Policy which is on YouTube, said that even Russians in Berlin, where she was during the interview, who opposed the war think Russia cannot afford to lose at this point. So, the prospect of Russia ending this war because of sanctions are slim.</p>\n\n<p>Another aspect of sanctions people ignore is blowback.

And I included the second sentence in order to highlight the impact.\n\nAnyway, back to your point-\n\nThese countries have large economies but I would not say that they are diverse. I would say that diversity can lead to a larger economy, but I wouldn't say that a large economy is necessarily diverse. I mean, you can even look at the USA - the services sector in the USA is about 80% of GDP and the US is heavily reliant upon trade. While the USA is more \"diverse\" compared to a 100% agricultural economy, and has a higher GDP, this diversity is founded upon a global economy with international trade networks. The US gets better tech, better living standards, etc. compared to that theoretical 100% agricultural economy - but a collapse in trade (due to economic measures like sanctions, etc.) would hurt the US significantly more.\n\nPart of what gives an economy \"size\" is that many layers of the economy has been built upon certain \"foundations.\" Sanctions and embargoes target these foundations. And that \"size\" is not easy to just move & find new foundations for. You need to find trading partners that can meet that kind of demand, that are actually able to give you what you need, etc. Russia can't get the same resources (in quality & quantity) from Nigeria that it would get from Europe or the USA.\n\nBasically, a large economy means more demand, meaning more trade requirements and more industry reliant upon trade relationships.\n\nAnd when the economy is hit, the scale is a lot greater, and it becomes a lot harder for certain countries or organizations to help you out. For example, if 2 countries with $5b gdp each were fighting a war against each other, aid from the USA or China could easily give one side a victory because while $1b in aid is nothing to the USA it is huge to an economy that small. Now take a country like Russia - Russia can't make up for billions of dollars in revenue that easily, because it has a sizeable economy relative to the rest of the world.\n\nSorry if this text was a bit messy but hopefully my point got across well enough.",

There are around 20 of the real pro-Putin, pro-Trump hardliners in the House, while Republicans have only 4 votes more than the minimum they need for a majority. The top priority of the House must always be to elect a Speaker of the House, all other business is on hold until one is elected, in addition to the fact that they control the agenda. In January it took 15 ballots for the new Congress to elect a Speaker, because most of the Republicans had coalesced around Kevin McCarthy, the Democrats were behind Hakeem Jefferies, but those 20 kept voting for various other people (including Donald Trump). (Technically this meant Jefferies had the plurality with 212 votes.) But McCarthy kept going to those 20 and trying to negotiate some kind of agreement to get them to vote for him, and ultimately they extracted two much discussed concessions before voting for him. The first was on the debt ceiling, they'd been very loud about their belief that a US debt default would be fine (rather than a disaster for the global economy like everyone else says) and they'd be happy to have one if it would help them get anything passed, and so they demanded that there be no clean debt ceiling bill.\n\nThe other concession was a procedural rule that would allow any one congressperson in the majority party to call for a vote for a new Speaker. If they invoked it *the entire process would start over again*. They can still do that, any time they want. Any time they decide McCarthy has upset them they can bring all Congressional business to a halt indefinitely until a new deal can be negotiated to elect a Speaker. In principle that deal could be a bipartisan one that cuts out the hardliners, but if McCarthy was willing to let them vote him down 14 times instead of exploring that option he probably wouldn't explore it in future either.\n\nSo, if those hardliners really want to stop a bipartisan aid package for Ukraine, they can. At least, until someone is Speaker who isn't depending on their votes.",

But McCarthy kept going to those 20 and trying to negotiate some kind of agreement to get them to vote for him, and ultimately they extracted two much discussed concessions before voting for him. The first was on the debt ceiling, they&#39;d been very loud about their belief that a US debt default would be fine (rather than a disaster for the global economy like everyone else says) and they&#39;d be happy to have one if it would help them get anything passed, and so they demanded that there be no clean debt ceiling bill.</p>\n\n<p>The other concession was a procedural rule that would allow any one congressperson in the majority party to call for a vote for a new Speaker. If they invoked it <em>the entire process would start over again</em>. They can still do that, any time they want. Any time they decide McCarthy has upset them they can bring all Congressional business to a halt indefinitely until a new deal can be negotiated to elect a Speaker. In principle that deal could be a bipartisan one that cuts out the hardliners, but if McCarthy was willing to let them vote him down 14 times instead of exploring that option he probably wouldn&#39;t explore it in future either.</p>\n\n<p>So, if those hardliners really want to stop a bipartisan aid package for Ukraine, they can. At least, until someone is Speaker who isn&#39;t depending on their votes.</p>\n</div>",

The '73 war highlighted just how potent second and third generation SAMs were in an integrated defense network, particular mobile vehicles like the SA-6 which were not tied to any one fixed location. The Israelis tried to send in Phantoms and Skyhawks to bomb advancing Arab troops, and suffered profoundly for it. The realization coming out of that war was that ground forces had to enable to commitment of air forces, not the other way around. That is, you had to strike the enemy's rear areas on the ground as part of a SEAD operation, and then send in aircraft to exploit that opening and further open up tactical opportunities for ground forces. Active Defense saw the battlefield as a network of systems, infantry, armor, artillery, atgms, and SAMs, and that existed in a larger network including air power. AD stressed that commanders had to knock out the 'legs' of the enemy system, attack one pillar at a time, to open up vulnerabilities in all the others. \n\nAirLand Battle was a successor to AD as well as the capstone to that concept. Indeed FM 71-2, The Mechanized and Armored Battalion manual, which contained the core concepts of tactical operations remained unrevised until, I think, 1986. AirLand Battle added to the network of systems idea another, a network of structures or units. The Soviet army, it concluded, existed in a network of various units each operating in support of one another. Battles were won not just by knocking systems out of each unit, but by knocking units out of the system. This could be done by destroying of course, it could also be done by attacking key points and the links between units. This is the ammo dump and artillery kind of battle (battlefield shaping). But back in the 1980s Donn Starry and Glen Otis would have described ALB as deep sensing and deep striking. Use specialized recon platforms, including 1st gen American drones and various ground search radars, to help locate enemy assets and attack them with PGMs. This could be done from the air of course, but keep in mind that right around then is when the M270 began to arrive in numbers. It was just as important for deep strike operations especially in the tactical, rather than operational, zone. \n\nImportantly to your question, both versions of American doctrine never really contemplated the possibility of air superiority or air dominance/supremacy, the latter of which was not even a concept (which I encountered) in the 1980s. There was a strong understanding that airpower could help in each doctrine, but just as likely ground forces would have to 'go it alone.' They may count on drones, or on airborne search systems, but it was unlikely they would get much in terms of CAS particularly something that we could call 'on demand.' So while both doctrines, and in particularly AirLand Battle (side note: AirLand Battle was used as early as 1974 to describe Active Defense, so while the 1982 doctrine was labeled this it should not be concluded that AD was all that different). hoped for air power, both were clear that ground forces needed to be ready to do it themselves. And needed to have capabilities like the M270, which is just a bigger heavier HIMARS, to conduct precision strikes if airpower couldn't. It was really only after Desert Storm, which I would argue introduced a whole lot of bad into the US DoD, that you see this idea that airpower could just go and do it all (if only we got air superiority to do it!). But I also bring up these doctrines not just as a historical anecdote but rather because I would argue that more or less the modern US military is still using a refined and modernized version of ALB. Despite forty years difference, the basic concepts are still the same. The expectation in the Army is that its forces need to sense deeply, preferably with integrated and unit organic recon, and then launch their own precision strikes (thanks to stuff like the M270/HIMARs with ATACAMs), Excalibur, or special operators to neutralize said targets. The issue the Army faces is that restrained budgets have made the USAF's argument of 'supremacy or bust' a lot more attractive, especially during an era when it seemed like the USAF with the F-15 and F-22 could take on all comers easily.

This is done to please the upper leadership since everyone benefits from positive reports and inflated numbers. It's a long post but worth reading (source: https://t.me/shouvalov/33)\n\n> -------------------------------------------------\n> \n> \"When civilians are surprised by Lancets and Krasnopols attacking enemy decoys, that\u2019s normal. But when people who at least served conscript service are surprised by it (and even more so they ridicule it), then you should also be surprised.\n> \n> The Soviet system of military service (which we have morally preserved) is very simple. The primary desire for a military man is to make something go boom, let's be honest. The more modern and powerful the available weapons are, the greater the internal need to boom them. The category \"expensive\" in military psychology is not applicable if it is not coming from your salary.\n> \n> **The second point are the reports. You can know for sure that you are hitting a decoy, and not the enemy\u2019s vehicle, you can suspect this, but if the decoy as a whole is not bad and suits you for a report, then you hit it and report about success to the top.**\n> \n> **Any Soviet officer (whom many people f*p on today) would have done just that. Because the army is simple. Because your report about the hit target (especially a \u201cfat\u201d one) is a joy for you, and for the authorities, and for the authorities of the authorities.**\n> \n> **But if you give an \u201cAll Clear\u201d and write a dull report that \"the detected target turned out to be false and it seemed inappropriate to hit it because of the need to save precision-guided ammunition,\" then you will become an a*shole for both the authorities and fellow officers. And for all of them, you will be \u201cnot really military.\u201d**\n> \n> How is this problem solved by the enemy? Their \"Western specialists\" got control over the targets. They did not try to break the established psychotype of the Soviet officer school (Ukrainian officers, especially the older ones, remained Soviet in their psychotype, there\u2019s nowhere for anything else to come from), they simply took control, removing the motivation to create false reports. A kind of substitution of the military classics for a business approach.\n> \n> But we're not only hitting wooden models. Now I\u2019ll say a vile and unpopular thing, but let at least one active officer point that out if I\u2019m lying: before, and after the appearance of Western military equipment - **in general, a very popular way to give a good result upwards is to beautifully fire at the enemy\u2019s already destroyed equipment.**\n> \n> **Bradley, that was ATGMed yesterday, today can be beautifully fired at from helicopters, and tomorrow you can hit it from self-propelled guns. With video recording, reports, and all the right angles. So this becomes not one, but three wrecked Bradleys. Since the political leadership is demanding a specific report, the General Staff will demand such a report too.**\n> \n> **And the military will solve it the way they know how - in a military way. I won't list specific examples, but everyone in the army knows perfectly well what I'm talking about. This is not exotic, this is already a mass practice.**\n> \n> Exotic is to make an order for a service of designing pictures a video of an objective control of a battle. You give an acquaintance a video and a photo of a wrecked MTLB, you give him a task, and he returns high-quality pictures to you, where instead of an MTLB there is a tank or self-propelled guns, next to which there are several wrecked infantry fighting vehicles.\n> \n> But in the army itself, no one will ever try and fight this, and it is stupid to scold the General Staff or the minister. Some external solution is needed. Something similar to how the targets of the Ukrainians are controlled by Western instructors.\n> \n> Because for the military, everything that I mentioned above is, as it were, not a crime, and not even a \u201cZalyot\u201d [i.e. blunder]. \u201cZalyot\u201d is when you were caught doing this, but caught in such a way that you could not get yourself out. Passing out the John Deere harvesters as Leopards was, of course, an oversight, but even then they got away. Although this should be punished three times, primarily those who were stupid enough to create this setup and get caught.\n> \n> And the rest ... The political leadership has its own universe, from which it gives orders and instructions to the military leadership. The military leadership already has its own universe, very different. And it gives instructions down and reports up, based on its vision of the situation. At the bottom - there is generally a harsh reality, but its adjusted for military perception. The necessary reports are required from you in the universe of military leadership, and if reality does not correspond to it, these are problems of reality. You're an officer, you can do it.\"\n\nhttps://twitter.com/wartranslated/status/1689388040307789824",

It&#39;s a long post but worth reading (source: <a href=\"https://t.me/shouvalov/33\">https://t.me/shouvalov/33</a>)</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>&quot;When civilians are surprised by Lancets and Krasnopols attacking enemy decoys, that\u2019s normal. But when people who at least served conscript service are surprised by it (and even more so they ridicule it), then you should also be surprised.</p>\n\n<p>The Soviet system of military service (which we have morally preserved) is very simple. The primary desire for a military man is to make something go boom, let&#39;s be honest. The more modern and powerful the available weapons are, the greater the internal need to boom them. The category &quot;expensive&quot; in military psychology is not applicable if it is not coming from your salary.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The second point are the reports. You can know for sure that you are hitting a decoy, and not the enemy\u2019s vehicle, you can suspect this, but if the decoy as a whole is not bad and suits you for a report, then you hit it and report about success to the top.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Any Soviet officer (whom many people f*p on today) would have done just that. Because the army is simple. Because your report about the hit target (especially a \u201cfat\u201d one) is a joy for you, and for the authorities, and for the authorities of the authorities.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>But if you give an \u201cAll Clear\u201d and write a dull report that &quot;the detected target turned out to be false and it seemed inappropriate to hit it because of the need to save precision-guided ammunition,&quot; then you will become an a*shole for both the authorities and fellow officers. And for all of them, you will be \u201cnot really military.\u201d</strong></p>\n\n<p>How is this problem solved by the enemy? Their &quot;Western specialists&quot; got control over the targets. They did not try to break the established psychotype of the Soviet officer school (Ukrainian officers, especially the older ones, remained Soviet in their psychotype, there\u2019s nowhere for anything else to come from), they simply took control, removing the motivation to create false reports. A kind of substitution of the military classics for a business approach.</p>\n\n<p>But we&#39;re not only hitting wooden models. Now I\u2019ll say a vile and unpopular thing, but let at least one active officer point that out if I\u2019m lying: before, and after the appearance of Western military equipment - <strong>in general, a very popular way to give a good result upwards is to beautifully fire at the enemy\u2019s already destroyed equipment.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Bradley, that was ATGMed yesterday, today can be beautifully fired at from helicopters, and tomorrow you can hit it from self-propelled guns. With video recording, reports, and all the right angles. So this becomes not one, but three wrecked Bradleys. Since the political leadership is demanding a specific report, the General Staff will demand such a report too.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>And the military will solve it the way they know how - in a military way. I won&#39;t list specific examples, but everyone in the army knows perfectly well what I&#39;m talking about. This is not exotic, this is already a mass practice.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Exotic is to make an order for a service of designing pictures a video of an objective control of a battle. You give an acquaintance a video and a photo of a wrecked MTLB, you give him a task, and he returns high-quality pictures to you, where instead of an MTLB there is a tank or self-propelled guns, next to which there are several wrecked infantry fighting vehicles.</p>\n\n<p>But in the army itself, no one will ever try and fight this, and it is stupid to scold the General Staff or the minister. Some external solution is needed. Something similar to how the targets of the Ukrainians are controlled by Western instructors.</p>\n\n<p>Because for the military, everything that I mentioned above is, as it were, not a crime, and not even a \u201cZalyot\u201d [i.e. blunder]. \u201cZalyot\u201d is when you were caught doing this, but caught in such a way that you could not get yourself out. Passing out the John Deere harvesters as Leopards was, of course, an oversight, but even then they got away. Although this should be punished three times, primarily those who were stupid enough to create this setup and get caught.</p>\n\n<p>And the rest ... The political leadership has its own universe, from which it gives orders and instructions to the military leadership. The military leadership already has its own universe, very different. And it gives instructions down and reports up, based on its vision of the situation. At the bottom - there is generally a harsh reality, but its adjusted for military perception. The necessary reports are required from you in the universe of military leadership, and if reality does not correspond to it, these are problems of reality. You&#39;re an officer, you can do it.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/wartranslated/status/1689388040307789824\">https://twitter.com/wartranslated/status/1689388040307789824</a></p>\n</div>",

With hundreds of billions of dollars of investment, they can take steps to address it. \n\n1. The ratio of workers needed to perform the work pre-war versus post-war could decrease with increased industrialization/automation. In less developed countries it is often cheaper to pay someone to do a job than to buy a machine or create a program to automate even a partial amount of it. With a country like Ukraine, I'm going to guess there is a lot of room for efficiency gains in relation to work hours. Having policies that support that would help with the worker gap. \n\n2. Efficiency of service provision will likely increase because more of the population will live in a smaller geographic area. Even if Ukraine retakes all their territory, towns have been destroyed and large deaths are covered in UXO, and that's before anyone not wanting to live near the Russian border. Combined with the trend of populations moving to cities, services will be clustered in smaller areas decreasing logistic costs to provide them. Recognizing the trend and reorganizing/making policies to improve efficiency there will help decrease costs of services. \n\n3. Implementing immigration and assimilation policies. Ukraine could design an immigration policy that selects for workers whose skills they need, and make it part of the process to attend education classes in Ukrainian language and history with passing tests as a requirement for staying in Ukraine until they reach a point where they become permanent residents. They could also go full Roman Empire and use policies to focus immigration in the east to repopulate and act as a buffer. \n\nOther factors that could help, though aren't in their control.\n\nRemittances from expats. Those who leave their country for economic reasons often remit some of their earnings back to their home country. Armenia, for example, has a significant portion of GDP come from the Armenian Diaspora world wide. Latin America countries have also traditionally received remittances from those who immigrated to the US for work. So it would be interesting to see how much money may come back from those who left. \n\nSomething I can't remember seeing addressed: life expectancy.
