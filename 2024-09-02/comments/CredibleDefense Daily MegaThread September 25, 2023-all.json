Although that's maybe semantic. From a microlevel, sure it looks like bending, but strategically they're very rigid and focusing heavily on not giving Ukraine an inch.\n\nIn the elastic defense concept (which I would argue is what bends) the idea is that you allow the enemy to gain ground going through one or more layers of defense, and then follow up with a counterattack that retakes your lost positions.\n\nRussia's defense emphasizes holding fast in place and only retreating after being significantly attrited themselves. This means their own counterattacks lack force and don't really tend to recover ground.\n\nA good example was the russian attack near Svatove a few months ago that quickly gained like ~5km over 2-3 days that everyone panicked about. But then was reversed by an AFU counterattack that pushed them back ~4km.",

That the Chinese promoted this <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2022/03/22/beijing-doubles-down-ukraine-biolab-disinformation\">received some reporting in March 2022</a>, but it is quite striking for Xi to have raised the issue with Biden seriously.</p>\n</div>",

I wouldn&#39;t rule out an isolated,  information-poor Xi completely, but the incentives are there for deflection and narrative alignment with Russia.</p>\n\n<p>If interested, here&#39;s the chat:\n<a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/share/62f5171a-4a72-41aa-ad2d-7daec6ad2222\">https://chat.openai.com/share/62f5171a-4a72-41aa-ad2d-7daec6ad2222</a></p>\n</div>",

        "body": "Today our beloved DeepState published a summary of the progress of the war in the main sectors of the front during the summer. I will post it translated. There isn't a lot that wasn't already known, but it's concise and extremely interesting in order to get a clear-headed and unbiased recap of the main events from the Ukrainian point of view. I hope the translation is good (I don't know Ukrainian). My personal additions are between [square brackets].\n\nhttps://t. me/DeepStateUA/17673 (and the following post)\n\nAnalysis of the actions (mostly) north of the Siversky Donets River:\n\n>Today we will analyze our and the enemy's summer campaigns. Globally, the picture of the front has not changed since November '22, when the enemy left the right-bank Kherson region. At that time, the enemy's withdrawal across the Dnipro, although unexpected to the last, was the last strategic change on the front. Now you will begin to appeal to the battles for Bakhmut, which drained significant resources from both sides, but this did not lead to any strategic changes.\n\n>Let's start with the enemy's offensive campaign in the Svatove area, which began actively in May with the loss of Masiutivka [Kupyansk sector - north of Lyman Pershyi]. The enemy launched an offensive in several areas at once: Masiutivka-Vilshana, Novoselivske-Kolomyichyha, Rayhorodka-Novovodyane and Serebryanske forestry.\n\n>Masiutivka-Vilshana - the Katsaps managed to occupy Masiutivka and push our forces back 2,5 kilometers. Near Vilshany, our advanced position in the village was actually destroyed, and the front shifted to the outskirts of Synkivka. However, reinforcements from the 67th OMBr [Mechanized Brigade] and 95th ODShBr [Air Assault Brigade], which extinguished fires where the 14 OMBr did not have time, prevented the situation from escalating into something serious.\n\n>Novoselivske-Kolomyichyha - the enemy managed to concentrate forces to strike at the \"hodgepodge\" of our units, occupying Kuzemivka station and 2/3 of Novoselivske. However, the transfer of that area to the control of the 25th OPDBr [Airborne Brigade] led to stabilization and a halt to the enemy offensive.\n\n>Rayhorodka-Novovodiane - in July, the Katsaps moved in with a large number of infantry and with the support of equipment, dealt a serious blow to the units in that area. The reason for this was the poor IF [translation from Ukrainian \"\u0406\u0444\" - likely an acronym whose meaning I ignore: any Ukrainian could clarify that for us?] preparation of the positions and the banal carelessness of the defenders, who later paid for it heavily. The deployment of the 68th OEBr [Jager Brigade] and the newly created 43rd OMBr saved us from the tragedy that could have happened if the mistakes had not been corrected.\n\n>Serebryanske forestry - here the enemy continues to attack throughout 2023. The deployment of the newly created brigade in early summer created a number of problems that the 95th ODShBr and other \"fire\" [fire-fighters: the air assault brigades in the north-eastern front are used as a highly mobile tactical reserve to be deployed in the most troublesome areas] units had to fix. Now the Azov Brigade of the National Guard has arrived there, and the enemy's chances of success are minimal. But the katsap has fulfilled its two minimum tasks - a buffer zone for Kreminna and the deterioration of the strategic position of our forces in Bilohorivka [Luhansk Oblast]. The latter is actually squeezed from three (!) sides.\n\n>Conclusion. Without additional measures to increase manpower and rapidly replenish equipment, the enemy has virtually no chance of any strategic success. The only chance they have is to hold on to the occupied territories. And that's what they're going to do. Muscovites can only attack meat [I think the meaning is: employing cannon fodder to attack], and it must be taken from somewhere. Their occupation of Bakhmut, although it has media value, has no strategic or even political impact. After the battles for the city, no one even thought to sit down at the negotiating table. On the contrary, the Ukrainian military leadership is motivated to continue fighting, including for Bakhmut.\n\nAnalysis of the Ukrainian offensive actions in Bakhmut and in the South:\n\n>The Defence Forces had two strikes in the summer - near Bakhmut and in the south. By the way, the southern strike had two locations - Tokmak and the cut of the Vremivsky ledge [Velyka Novosilka sector].\n\n>Bakhmut direction - according to the spokespersons' statements, the goal is to surround Bakhmut. Over the past 4 months, south of the city, they have managed to de-occupy Andriivka and Klishchiyivka, which opens up the possibility of a further attack towards the road to Horlivka. The situation is not so good on the northern front, where initially everything started quite successfully, but the strategic mistake of going into Berkhivka, which is located in the lowlands, cost us dearly. Now the initiative has even gone to the enemy. Attempts to break through the enemy defences near Zaliznyanske and Rozdolivka did not bring any significant success. Bakhmut is not surrounded, as the media claimed. For the enemy, it is a stronghold where thousands of fa[*]gots are concentrated. It is worth mentioning the connections of the 3rd and the 5th OShBr [Assault Brigades] and 80th ODShBr, which, under the auspices of the \"Adam\" Tactical Group, achieved success, which is now being used by all media persons.\n\n>South. Vremivsky Ridge - the task of cutting the ridge was successfully implemented, although we did not manage to do anything more. In the first month, the network had enough footage of our columns of newly formed brigades, which were supposed to break through the defence in the style of Guderian-Hoth. The tragedy of the 37th OBrMP [Marine Brigade] near Novodonetske also had a negative impact. Due to the mistakes of 5-7 June, all offensive actions were extremely difficult. Other brigades had to suffer unnecessary losses because the enemy's tank fist from Kermenchyk spoiled all plans in the area.\n\n>South. Robotyne - the operation lasted for three months and attracted attention not only in Ukraine but also around the world. Even a drunkard in the Moscow region understood why Leopards and Bradleys appeared near Mala Tokmachka. But it was in vain to hope for a blitzkrieg. The Katsaps considered this area as a place for our breakthrough, so everything was dug up and mined during the winter and spring. Official communication also played a cruel joke. While in May the Katsaps in Tokmak were saying goodbye to their families, after the first footage of the downed Leopards, we were afraid. The situation with the two top tanks, which instead of providing cover for the infantry, drove into the bushes to simulate getting stuck on the ground, is a case in point.\n\n>It was only in mid-August that the Katsap began to retreat and bring in reserves. There was a lot of heroism by our guys: deep breakthroughs that ended in a rollback due to the lack of success on the flanks. We know of at least two such cases. Robotyne came under our control, but so far we have not been able to expand by taking Verbove and Kopani or drive the wedge deeper. The latter is a consequence of the former, as we continue to suffer losses in equipment due to the peculiarities of the contact line. Finally, I would like to mention the 47th OMBr, which has become a hostage to its own media coverage. The brigade really showed the best result of all the newly created brigades, often acted in cold blood and did not retreat. Over time, the problem of excessive media exposure was resolved. In September, it became known that the Brigade's Commander had been replaced. Whatever happened, he could hardly be blamed for anything. It was him and his team who were the drivers in the area.\n\n>Conclusion. It was a difficult summer for the Defense Forces, but the defense campaign for Bakhmut was no easier. Of course, we did not achieve any strategic success, but the Robotyne salient has all the prospects. The only condition is time, and we are running out of it. A new defense line is already being built east of Tokmak. The enemy is also reinforcing the Krasna Polyana-Volnovakha-Donetsk line. You can't underestimate the Katsap in engineering. On the other hand, 2023 demonstrated the superiority of Ukrainian infantry in equal battles. Where there was a shortage of anti-aircraft guns and artillery, the quality factor of infantry was already leveled off. The summer demonstrated that the war will not end on our terms in 2024. The Ukrainian state needs to prepare for new challenges that it will have to face soon.",

Where there was a shortage of anti-aircraft guns and artillery, the quality factor of infantry was already leveled off. The summer demonstrated that the war will not end on our terms in 2024. The Ukrainian state needs to prepare for new challenges that it will have to face soon.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

                "body": "Your analysis has got valid points - although I find it too \"ruthless\" to some extent.\n\nAs usual, as we all strive not to be war analysis tourists, we know that particularly in such a war it's not just the square kilometers gained/lost (or even less, say, the population of the villages) that matter, but also and especially, for instance, the topography of the area and the human and material losses experienced by both sides.\n\nAt this point, given that the resources to devote to the action are what they are (i.e. limited), I am quite sure that the Ukrainians have given up, beyond propaganda statements, on surrounding Bakhmut but are engaged in attrition actions in the southern flank with the main objective of keeping busy the (numerous) VDV units deployed in the area and the bulk of the 2nd and 3rd Corps. The attrition in the area, although the Ukrainians are having major losses, probably favors them in an important way due to the employment of experienced and well-motivated forces with excellent knowledge of the terrain (yes, I am talking about the 3rd Assault Brigade). They have pushed the Russians to the railroad and are in a good position to begin serious actions towards the settlements of Kurdyumivka and Zelenopillya. Already today the vast majority of Russian supplies towards Bakhmut are coming from Popasna due to the impossibility of using other roads.\n\nThe northern flank proved really difficult to penetrate, and the affair is worsened by the lower quality of Ukrainian units deployed in the area. In particular, the Ukrainian 57th Motorized Brigade suffered really heavy losses in the battles around Berkhivka. The Soledar sector was heavily reinforced and is garrisoned by the bulk of the 106th VDV Division - Ukrainian actions in the area were limited and aimed at testing the enemy's strength.\n\nIn the Kamianske sector (Vasylivka) Ukrainian actions have been very limited since mid-June, at the moment the fighting is mostly positional and as far as I know not that \"expensive\" for both sides. It has become a fairly quiet sector compared to what is going on a few tens of kilometers to the east. The Ukrainians are extremely cautious in that area and probably prefer to wait for decisions by the General Staff about which side they're going to pick in order to expand the salient around Robotyne - whether pushing towards this sector or towards Polohy, where we all know the fresh 35th Army is deployed.\n\nIn the last days there seems to be some news in the Tokmak sector, nothing too big (no breakthroughs, despite what was said), but interesting tactical advances, particularly thanks to the recent deployment in the actions of the 71st Jager Brigade around Verbove to assist the 82nd Air Assault Brigade. The situation is not easy - losses are heavy, Russian reinforcements are numerous and in part of high quality, with the deployment of two entire VDV divisions. Determination and cold blood on the part of the Ukrainians will be needed. The Russians are deploying their heavy hitters in the area and thus are willing to sustain the attrition of such formations, as they evidently know that the loss of positions in this sector would be even worse for them. In this context, the first thing to look at is attrition rates of both sides.\n\nIn the Velyka Novosilka sector the Ukrainian losses were heavy and the successes have been partial - but the Russians also had to commit numerous reserves to the area. Novodonetske was perhaps the biggest disappointment. I expected it to fall at least two months ago. Last week there was a failed attack towards Novomaiorske by the 137th Battalion of the 35th Marine Brigade with relevant casualties - the Ukrainians call that area \"cursed\", mostly due to the fact that the Russians dominate it from above due to their control of the heights around Kermenchyk. Pryyutne has also proved to be a tough nut to crack - infantry battles have been going on for weeks in virtually every tree line in the area with significant losses on both sides.",

While it's not surprising that many people would oppose the war to some degree, the willingness to break the law and take photos of top secret materials (even if it's less \"secret\" in these cases) and provide them to a pro Ukraine group on request seems to suggest that there may be more discontent then we may assume.  If the claim that the airbase attack was done by saboteurs and not drones is true then may indicate an even bigger potential for anti war actions in Russia.  \n\nIt's a small sample size, but the people who get to work with Submarines and Military Aircraft are supposed to be fairly thoroughly vetted so these actions **may** be indicative of a trend in Russian opinions on the war.",

While it&#39;s not surprising that many people would oppose the war to some degree, the willingness to break the law and take photos of top secret materials (even if it&#39;s less &quot;secret&quot; in these cases) and provide them to a pro Ukraine group on request seems to suggest that there may be more discontent then we may assume.  If the claim that the airbase attack was done by saboteurs and not drones is true then may indicate an even bigger potential for anti war actions in Russia.  </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s a small sample size, but the people who get to work with Submarines and Military Aircraft are supposed to be fairly thoroughly vetted so these actions <strong>may</strong> be indicative of a trend in Russian opinions on the war.</p>\n</div>",

Crimea / Sevastopol is Russia\u2019s only port with the ability to do that year round.</p>\n\n<p>So when Euromaidan happened, that\u2019s why Crimea was so quickly and completely seized, whereas Pro-Russian \u201crebellion\u201d efforts in Donetsk and Luhansk were relatively half-assed.</p>\n\n<p>Sevastopol then played a major role in the Russian intervention in Syria, as well as power projection into the Mediterranean and North Africa.</p>\n\n<p>February 2022 was Russia trying to \u201cfinish the job\u201d against Ukraine\u2019s western shift, because the 2014 invasion backfired in a way and brought Ukraine much closer to the west. Putin\u2019s rhetoric on Ukraine not having a \u201chistorical right to existence\u201d or whatever nonsense wasn\u2019t invented until the lead up to war in 2022, after a near decade of western training missions, aid, assistance and the War in the Donbas. I think Putin\u2019s head got too big from saving the Syrian government from collapse, interfering in the 2016 US elections, expanding influence in Africa, and bullying western powers. If he could get away with all that, maybe he could \u201crebuild the empire\u201d by seizing further territory in Ukraine.</p>\n</div>",

In fact, they don't recognise separatists movements (including Kosovo).

If you think striking during peak passenger hour is proportionate targeting, then you really need to reconsider your morality.</p>\n\n<p>Trains and railways are generally not on the highly list of priority and signficance simply because they have varied times of arrival and railways are relatively fast and easy to repair (compared to the cost of firing a Tochka-U). It&#39;s also why you rarely see significant strikes on railways during this war compared to other forms of infrastructure.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think Sudetenland is a complex issue and yes if that was the extent of Nazi ambitions, it would&#39;ve been not unreasonable</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So you clearly don&#39;t support territorial integrity for nations. Does that mean that if Russia loses this war, then you will shut up if there&#39;s a scenario where Russia&#39;s Republics, Okrugs, Krais and Oblasts want to secede? Would this be the &#39;accountability&#39; for their actions you mentioned below?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>this is being held accountable for policy choices that UA made</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yea, you are again blaming the Ukrainian government&#39;s decision. Not listening to a country = invasion and illegal annexation by said country  and not wanting to associate with your government since you destabilised their East and illegally annexed their territory = deserved invasion is your moral compass on accountability.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>UA has been in a state of civil war since 2014</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They had their territory illegally annexed by Russia and Russian-backed (and manned) separtists. Is attempting to recapture Avdiivka facilitating &#39;co-existence&#39;? I love how your &#39;both sides did this&#39; arguments ends when you are trying to bring up arguments in Russia&#39;s favour.</p>\n\n<p>Ukrainians and Russians were literally seen as brothers prior to the invasion, despite their oppression as many families have relatives across the border. They were neutral (and in many cases hostile) on NATO and EU ascession. It literally took a full scale invasion to finally realign all the regions of Ukraine to look West.</p>\n</div>",

It was a frontline in March 2022, during the very chaotic first weeks of the war, as RU forces were pushing towards Kiev and UA was desperately trying to throw anything they had back at them. This was before civilians had time to evacuate, and at the same time UA TDF was recruiting civilians in masse, without supplying uniforms so there were tons of combatants dressed in civilian clothes which made the situation even more volatile and chaotic\n\n  \nThe other important context for Bucha was the ongoing cease fire negotiations between RU and UA. These negotiations were later revealed to have been sabotaged by UK and other Western allies, and Bucha was widely understood to have been the one thing that allowed Zelensky to take the hard line.\n\nSo what really happened? I think it's impossible to know. All kinds of explanations seem to be possible and viable, starting all the way from RU engaging in systematic war crimes (though why this was never repeated anywhere else? even if you argue that RU learned their lesson, why Bucha was the only location this happened in the early weeks?), to RU engaging in \"filtration\" and getting too overzealous with it, to RU making mistaken killings in the chaos of early war, to RU fighting civilian clothed TDF, to UA intentionally pushing civilian clothed forces, to UA engaging in \"filtration\" after retaking Bucha, to completely staging the event (though that's unlikely considering the available evidence). In fact - it's possible all of the above, except for the most extreme unlikely explanations are true, and happened together. Maybe some victims were mistaken for TDF, and some other victims were \"filtrated\" by UA... it's not impossible that there were many separate things ongoing at the same time.\n\nWill we ever know the truth? Probably not any time soon. There isn't an unbiased body today that could have been trusted by both sides. ICC is clearly not it, as they have already shown their bias. The evidence available isn't conclusive. Yes victims were identified. Some of them had gun shot wounds. What does it prove though? RU and UA use the exact same guns.  And so on.",

Older kids are being taught how to dig trenches, throw grenades and shoot with real ammunition.\n\n>In schools across the country, service in the armed forces is being glorified, \u201cvoluntary companies\u201d of teenagers are being formed and the national curriculum is being changed to emphasize defense of the motherland.\n\n\n>In short, Russia\u2019s children are being prepared for war.\n\n>The militarization of Russia\u2019s public schools has intensified since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, **driven not by a spontaneous surge of patriotic feeling, but by the government in Moscow.**\n\n\n\n>The investment is huge. Education Minister Sergei Kravtsov said recently that there are now about 10,000 so-called \u201cmilitary-patriotic\u201d clubs in Russian schools and colleges, and a quarter-of-a-million people take part in their work.\n\n>These clubs are part of a multi-pronged effort that includes a radical overhaul of the school curriculum. There are mandatory classes on military-patriotic values; updated history books accentuate Russian military triumphs.\n\n>In August, President Vladimir Putin signed a law introducing a new mandatory course in schools: \u201cFundamentals of Security and Defense of the Motherland.\u201d\n\n\n>The Education Ministry subsequently promoted courses as part of this initiative to include excursions to military units, \u201cmilitary-sports games, meetings with military personnel and veterans,\u201d and classes on drones.\n\n>High-school students would also be taught to use live ammunition \u201cunder the guidance of experienced military unit officers or instructors exclusively at the firing line,\u201d according to the ministry.\n\n>The program, which is being tested this year and will be introduced in 2024, is designed to instil in the students \u201can understanding and acceptance of the aesthetics of military uniforms, military rituals and combat traditions,\u201d according to an Education Ministry document uncovered by the Russian independent media outlet Important Stories.\n\n>Russian state media RIA Novosti shows photos of a **new history book with a chapter on the \"special military operation,\"** Russia's name for its war on Ukraine.\n\n>Modern history is being rewritten too. The standard textbook, \u2018History of Russia,\u2019 now has the Crimea Bridge on its cover and a new chapter devoted to the recent history of Ukraine. **There are sections entitled \u201cFalsification of history,\u201d \u201cRevival of Nazism,\u201d \u201cUkrainian neo-Nazism,\u201d and \u201cRussia is a country of heroes.\u201d**\n\n\n>Putin has repeatedly falsely framed the Russian invasion of Ukraine as a \u201cspecial mission\u201d to protect Russian speakers from genocide at the hands of \u201cneo-Nazis.\u201d\n\n>A new chapter falsely claims that Ukraine \u201copenly declared its desire to acquire nuclear weapons,\u201d and \u201cunprecedented sanctions have been introduced against Russia, since the West is trying in every way to bring down the Russian economy.\u201d\n\n\n\n>The book appears designed to stoke a sense of historical grievance among Russian children and lay out an existential battle for the nation\u2019s survival, **a common theme in the state media pumped daily into living rooms across the country.**\n\n>President Putin has personally led the campaign to inject patriotism into Russia\u2019s schools. At an event at the Kremlin this month, he told a group of children about a letter that his grandfather had sent to his father, who was fighting the Nazis during the World War II.\n\n\n>\u201cBeat the scum!\u201d he had told him, according to Putin\u2019s account.\n\n>Putin went on: \u201cI realised why we won the Great Patriotic War. People with such an attitude simply cannot be defeated. We were absolutely invincible, just as we are now.\u201d\n\n>>Children taught to assemble guns\n\n>An extensive survey by CNN of local and social media in Russia found that children as young as seven or eight are receiving basic military training.\n\n>**In July, for example, children in Belgorod gave themselves call-signs \u2013 one adopted \u201cSledgehammer\u201d \u2013 and took part in exercises that included the use of automatic weapons, assembling a machine gun and getting through an obstacle course.**\n\n\n>Belgorod\u2019s Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov suggested conducting exercises with schoolchildren **and pre-schoolers regularly.**\n\n>In Krasnodar in May, dozens of children **who looked no more than seven or eight years old marched in army and navy uniforms, some clutching imitation automatic weapons,** as they passed dignitaries on a podium.\n\n>In a parade held in the city of Vologda, a small child saluted and told an official: \u201c\u0421omrade parade commander! The parade is ready. I am Commander Uliana Shumelova.\u201d\n\n>Similar scenes have played out from Sakhalin in Russia\u2019s Far East to Yeysk on the Sea of Azov. Some of the children look excited, some bewildered. In Yeysk, a pre-schooler led the march of the border guards, as his peers chanted: \u201cOne, two, three. Left, left, left!\u201d\n\n>Most of the children in these parades are in one sort of military uniform or another, trying to march in step without much success. Frequently they carry pictures of Russian military heroes.\n\n\n>The symbolism of what the Kremlin calls the \u201cSpecial Military Operation\u201d in Ukraine is also celebrated. In the city of Astrakhan, nursery children wore uniforms and had toy vehicles emblazoned with the letter Z, a propagandist symbol used to show support for the Ukraine war.\n\n>The Ministry of Defense has scaled up its outreach to schools with a well-publicized Christmas Tree of Wishes\u2019 program, similar to the Make-A-Wish Foundation, in which the minister himself, Sergei Shoigu, has been active.\n\n>Shoigu invited a 9-year old girl called Daria from Udmurt to the Victory Day parade in Moscow in May.

Instead, they're being held just behind the frontlines for use in counterattacking Ukrainian advances. These units are also extensively using ATGMs and Lancet drones to attrit Ukrainian units advancing against the frontlines. There's also reporting from early in the counteroffensive that these elite formations are often used to shore up low morale units like Storm Z and mobiks to prevent them from fleeing, while also providing those units with more advanced capabilities than they would have otherwise (like ATGMs, Lancets, better communications, night vision, etc). \n\nSo these forces are suffering attrition as they launch counterattacks or get hit by Ukrainian shelling, but there aren't many VDV sitting on the very frontline getting shelled day after day.

Instead, they&#39;re being held just behind the frontlines for use in counterattacking Ukrainian advances. These units are also extensively using ATGMs and Lancet drones to attrit Ukrainian units advancing against the frontlines. There&#39;s also reporting from early in the counteroffensive that these elite formations are often used to shore up low morale units like Storm Z and mobiks to prevent them from fleeing, while also providing those units with more advanced capabilities than they would have otherwise (like ATGMs, Lancets, better communications, night vision, etc). </p>\n\n<p>So these forces are suffering attrition as they launch counterattacks or get hit by Ukrainian shelling, but there aren&#39;t many VDV sitting on the very frontline getting shelled day after day.

I'm talking about logistical support only.\"\r  \n\r  \nDetails: Bihun added that the Ministry of Economy has proposed setting up competence centres that would assess the relevance of certain procurements, in particular for the needs of the Armed Forces.\r  \n\r  \n\"We need to have decision-making centres that take responsibility for what we buy and how we buy it. Those who allocate funds, together with the recipients, should share responsibility for effective spending, and therefore they should have the relevant expertise and professionalism and do much more effective planning.\"\n\nBihun believes that when local governments receive additional powers as part of decentralisation, it is a good thing. However, at the same time, with extra powers comes extra responsibility.\r  \n\r  \nCurrently, each budgetary institution holds the same tender as all the others, buying electricity, gas, cleaning services, etc. This means that hundreds, sometimes thousands, of entities are doing the same work.\r  \n\r  \n \"For this reason, from a KPI perspective, this raises the question of how to be more productive and make the process itself more efficient.

There was a discussion here about given the limited availability of precision deep strike capabilities, what should be the Ukrainian order of target priority and the general consensus was command centers first. Will be interesting to see if that changes if/when more PGMs become available.</p>\n</div>",

Ukraine has lost tons of MRAPS, humvees, and M113s, while Russia has lost substantial numbers of artillery, tanks, and IFVs. I'm not sure what this site is counting as \"AFVs\", but it likely lumps in troop transports with Bradleys and BMPs as I don't see these listed as separate categories. That seems unnecessarily broad to me. The loss ratio needs to be understood in the context of force degradation rather than directly comparing the number of vehicles lost.\n\nFurther, it's important to note that some vehicle classes are easier to replace than others. America has functionally unlimited numbers of MRAPs it is willing to send. AFU can lose as many of them as it wants and suffer little to no force degradation, so long as the crew is protected (which by anecdotal accounts seems to be the case). So, is it reasonable to count an MRAP loss as functionally equivalent to a tank loss? To me, not really.\n\nAnd lastly, any discussion of force degradation needs some idea of the materiel quantity both sides have at any given time. A loss ratio of 1.7 against Ukraine is favorable if Ukraine began with 3x equipment, just to pull some numbers out of my ass. Since we don't have this information, it's hard to evaluate whether this 1.7 is favorable or unfavorable. In that case, loss ratios again show themselves to be of little value.

Equipment losses are valuable not because they provide insight into a) force degradation or b) lack of replaceability, but rather they provide the most independent arbitrator of what is happening on the battlefield.

In those cases, are they the best possible data we can have to understand the early universe? No. Are they the data available? Yes. Thus inference must be qualified. One can scan both Russian and Ukrainian telegram channels to get very specific assessments of force quality, but then bias gets in the way.\n\nEquipment loss data is valuable because it is one of the most unbiased estimates of what is happening on the ground when carefully curated (thank you Oryx et al). What you correctly note is that it comes with high variance - e.g. the effects we see may be several steps removed from cause, or we are missing key information (replacement potential) that frustrates interpretation. This fundamental issue is also at the heart of a lot of machine learning challenges - bias and variance are opposite ends of the spectrum when it comes to learning. They are always present to some degree, and erring on one side or the other is based on the specific costs and benefits. For my part, I focus on the Oryx data because I am most worried about bias and have a high tolerance for variance. Others may have a different weight to either pole, but I doubt there are solutions, just different tradeoffs. \n\nWithin the limits of the data, I'd interpret the Ukrainian loss skew near Robotyne to indicate high strategic prioritization and willingness to bear costs when engaging Russia. The skew towards infantry mobility vehicles indicates a higher casualty rate here as well (probabilistically, not definitively). We have enough data from other periods of this war and other parts of Ukraine to show this is an unusual deviation from the norm.
