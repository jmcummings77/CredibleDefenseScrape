According to [this analysis](https://texty.org.ua/projects/111874/mobilizacijnyj-rezerv/) in Ukraine there are up to 273 thousand men aged 25 and 26 who could be summoned. This figure excludes students, who are exempt at any age, but includes men of this age who are already serving as contract soldiers. \n\nMoreover, regarding students, the possibility for male college students between the age of 18 and 22 to spend a study period of up to 6 months abroad [was approved](https://uagolos.com/choloviky-studenty-vikom-18-22-roky-zmozhut-vyyizhdzhaty-zakordon/) - upon invitation from the host foreign university and upon possession of a document from the local Territorial Recruitment Center. I think the limit is 22 because it shouldn't be ruled out that in the second half of this year or in 2025, the minimum mobilization age may be lowered to 22, as many officers are asking for. That said, I found out just a few weeks ago, however, that for guys who have not turned 21 yet there is a need for parental consent to sign a contract.\n\nAs for the mobilization law, last week the Defense Committee of the Verkhovna Rada finished discussing and voting on the 4269 (!) amendments. By mid-April, more or less, the law will go to the parliament for the second reading and we will finally know the final details.",

Namely, having the Republican leadership, including Speaker Johnson, use Republican Rep. Fitzgerald's discharge petition as a way of bypassing hardline MAGA opposition, with only a 50% majority required.  Johnson has been consistently using a suspension of the rules, with a 2/3 majority required, in order to pass legislation with Democratic support. But there's serious doubt whether Johnson could get 2/3 support for any given Ukraine bill, with conservative riders attached which would allow Johnson to claim some kind of face-saving victory.\n\nArticle quote follows:\n\nWhen Johnson returns, he will also face increasing pressure from defense hawks who have given the speaker time over the last several months to get through a crush of spending deadlines and now expect to see action.\n\n\u201cThere just hasn\u2019t been any clarity on No. 1, what the product is and No. 2, what the strategy is to pass it,\u201d said Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, a Republican from Pennsylvania.\n\nFitzpatrick has sponsored his own foreign assistance package using what is known as a discharge petition, a rarely deployed tactic that can force a bill to the floor if 218 House members sign on. So far that petition has just over than a dozen signatures.\n\nWhile leadership has thrown cold water on using the discharge petition to get Ukraine aid across the finish line, Fitzpatrick\u2019s bill does allow for a one-time substitution, meaning that leadership could include whatever bill they wanted and get it passed by a 218-vote threshold instead of a vote that would likely require a two-thirds majority.\n\n[https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/other/house-speaker-mike-johnson-remains-undecided-on-best-path-ahead-on-ukraine-aid/ar-BB1kXvOh](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/other/house-speaker-mike-johnson-remains-undecided-on-best-path-ahead-on-ukraine-aid/ar-BB1kXvOh)\n\nHaving Johnson use a discharge petition in this manner would certainly be ironic, since it's always been considered the knife that is stabbed in the Speaker's back by disloyal party members. This article floats the scenario of Johnson using the knife himself.",

But there&#39;s serious doubt whether Johnson could get 2/3 support for any given Ukraine bill, with conservative riders attached which would allow Johnson to claim some kind of face-saving victory.</p>\n\n<p>Article quote follows:</p>\n\n<p>When Johnson returns, he will also face increasing pressure from defense hawks who have given the speaker time over the last several months to get through a crush of spending deadlines and now expect to see action.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThere just hasn\u2019t been any clarity on No. 1, what the product is and No. 2, what the strategy is to pass it,\u201d said Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, a Republican from Pennsylvania.</p>\n\n<p>Fitzpatrick has sponsored his own foreign assistance package using what is known as a discharge petition, a rarely deployed tactic that can force a bill to the floor if 218 House members sign on. So far that petition has just over than a dozen signatures.</p>\n\n<p>While leadership has thrown cold water on using the discharge petition to get Ukraine aid across the finish line, Fitzpatrick\u2019s bill does allow for a one-time substitution, meaning that leadership could include whatever bill they wanted and get it passed by a 218-vote threshold instead of a vote that would likely require a two-thirds majority.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/other/house-speaker-mike-johnson-remains-undecided-on-best-path-ahead-on-ukraine-aid/ar-BB1kXvOh\">https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/other/house-speaker-mike-johnson-remains-undecided-on-best-path-ahead-on-ukraine-aid/ar-BB1kXvOh</a></p>\n\n<p>Having Johnson use a discharge petition in this manner would certainly be ironic, since it&#39;s always been considered the knife that is stabbed in the Speaker&#39;s back by disloyal party members. This article floats the scenario of Johnson using the knife himself.</p>\n</div>",

Moreover, for the training of units that were formed from scratch. It takes 27 days to form, for example, a battalion. This includes individual training, group training as part of a unit, and interoperability training. 27 days and an infantry unit is ready for use on the battlefield,\" Vadym Skibitskyi said in an interview with Apostrophe TV.*\n\n[\u200bNew Infantry Battalion Every 27 Days: Ukraine's Intelligence on Russian Mobilization Resource and Training Quality | Defense Express | April 2024](https://en.defence-ua.com/news/new_infantry_battalion_every_27_days_ukraines_intelligence_on_russian_mobilization_resource_and_training_quality-10029.html)\n\n*Russia's Ministry of Defense has expanded and sped up the training for new units but the main focus is simple infantry which is being traded for meters of Ukrainian soil captured*\n\n*Compared to the so-called \"partial mobilization\" campaign in the fall of 2022, when Russian military training facilities were overwhelmed with the number of draftees, there likely won't be such a problem this time, Skibitskyi noted. On the other hand, with such a hasty boot camp, the quality of training recruits receive is poor. In support of his point, the intelligence official recalls that many of the prisoners of war held by Ukraine surrendered to Ukrainian forces in just a few days since their arrival on the frontline.*\n\n*Moscow is aware of it but continues to crash-course the recruits nonetheless because the ultimate strategy is to use sheer quantity of manpower to achieve goals.

Boot camp isn't just to learn new skills, it's also a place to get into shape (very important especially for dismounted infantry), and to adopt to military lifestyle, especially field living. Neither of those things can be sped up without significant drop in quality. \n\nWhen it comes to training, skills are EXTREMELY perishable, not to mention that TTPs that someone might have learned years earlier are no longer used in Ukraine. Those need to be not only learned in a crawl, walk, run format, but also drilled to the point the individual can perform them under stress, day or night, regardless if they're tired, hungry, scared, etc. That goes for individual and unit training.\n\nI personally served three military enlistments with breaks in service between them, six months and two years respectively, for the latter I can say for a fact that I needed way more than 27 days to be combat ready. \n\n>Also people already sent to Ukraine after formation sit in the deep rear in Zap, Luhansk, Donetsk and do training on the spot there hence why you've seen for example those HIMARS strike hitting people at the polygon.\n\nThe way this works in this war for both sides, in the deep strategic rear areas, inside Russia or in Western Ukraine or even NATO countries, that's where initial training is done. Some are run by rear echelon support staff of a forward deployed unit that the individuals will later be assigned to, others attend an initial training induction center for MOS specific training at which point they'll be assigned to a unit afterwards (the UAF mostly use this system). \n\nAt that point they travel to the front line areas Ukraine where the tactical rear areas are located, brigade for Ukraine and usually division for the Russians. In those areas the replacements join a unit who has recently been rotated out of the front lines, giving the veterans a few days or even a week of R&R, taking in replacements, then having 1-2 weeks to conduct training especially to integrate new troops focusing on a very specific TTP specific to that time and place, then they are rotated back into the line, to either defend or attack.\n\nThose training centers can't be located further away because they're  run and administered by the tactical headquarters, who not only control a sector of the front lines but also \"own\" battlespace in the rear areas too. If they leave their area, their command doesn't own it, someone else does, so they need official permission and coordination to do anything.\n\nHence the rear area strikes on training where the Russians got caught a few times. UAF too, they've gotten hit a few times too. \n\nIf anyone heard Jack Watling from RUSI saying that the Ukrainians can't do any unit training above the company level because they're afraid of being detected, this is what he's talking about. Because brigades are almost never rotated off the front lines, all the training they are capable of performing must be in their tactical rear areas during company or battalion rotations, somewhere within 100 km or so of the front lines, which is still within range of common Russian ISR and PGM strike capabilities. So they fear gathering in large concentrations for training because they might be targeted. If they were moved to the strategic rear, western Ukraine for example, they'd have few to no problems (minus dipshit soldiers posting their location on social media or spies) but again, they're not rotated regularly to do that, so they can't. \n\nFor the Russian and Ukrainian military leadership, this is acceptable. They know more training is necessary but they both struggle with a ridiculously high OPTEMPO caused by political leadership, they need numbers on the front lines, so they've accepted a level of low quality forces, knowing that they can always task organize using a smaller number of elite units who are better trained to perform the more complicated assignments (in theory).
