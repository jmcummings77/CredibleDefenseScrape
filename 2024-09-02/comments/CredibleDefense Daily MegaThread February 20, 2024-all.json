I've not yet signed a deal**,\" Defence Minister Bill Blair said in a recent interview, adding that he spoke recently with the finance and innovation ministers about the issue.\n\n>\"We're looking hard at making an investment in Canada to increase [munitions] production.

Sources say federal officials are skeptical and believe there won't be enough long-term demand to justify ramping up production of the M795 variant of the 155 millimetre shell known as the \"operational round\" \u2014 the NATO-standard ammunition needed by both Ukraine and the Canadian Army in Europe.\n\nAs with many countries, defense economics comes into play with these investments. Ironically, not investing now may result in more expenses later. Such errors have previously been seen with regards to Canada's acquisition of F-35s. Ukraine is looking to be a long war.

There will be a desire for shells during that time and there will be a strong desire for shells in NATO regardless of who wins this war.

            "body": "Well, [the foreign troops are withdrawing](https://www.zitamar.com/sadc-confirms-drawdown-of-troops-from-cabo-delgado-has-begun/).\n> The Southern African Development Community (SADC) has begun withdrawing its troops from Cabo Delgado province in preparation for a complete exit by 15 July this year, the organisation confirmed in a statement yesterday.\n\nThis article [\"What does the end of SAMIM (Southern African Development Community Mission in Mozambique) mean for Cabo Delgado (The Insurgency)\"](https://www.zitamar.com/what-does-the-end-of-samim-mean-for-cabo-delgado/) provides some interesting context. It looks like the Mozambique forces haven't been stunningly succesful, but SAMIM hasn't been succesful either. \n\nQuestions I'd like to know the answers to:\n- How contained is this insurgency?\n- How important is Cabo Delgado?\n- Will TotalEnergies will hire a PMC to provide security for their [$20bn refinery](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/totalenergies-restart-its-delayed-mozambique-lng-project-early-2024-sources-2023-12-22/#:~:text=Work%20on%20the%20project%20has,force%20majeure%20and%20halting%20construction.) in Cabo Delgado?\n\n\n\n> SAMIM\u2019s force consists of around 1,900 personnel, of whom just under 1,500 are from the South African National Defense Force, based in the embattled district of Macomia. The most significant consequence of the SAMIM withdrawal will be that it will force the Mozambican Armed Defense Forces (FADM) to fill the security vacuum these troops leave behind, but its performance so far has been far from encouraging. On 18 January, FADM abandoned the strategic village of Mucojo, effectively handing the insurgents unbridled access to the Macomia coast. Mozambican security forces are known to be suffering from a shortage of food and many soldiers have not been paid in months. If the Mozambican military is struggling to fulfil its current responsibilities, it is hard to imagine it coping with an expanded role when SAMIM departs.\n\n> To offset the low morale of the rank and file infantry, the European Union has trained just over 1,000 members of a special forces unit, known as the Quick Reaction Force (QRF), since September 2022. The QRF should, in theory, be capable of carrying out offensive operations without the support of international forces. The effectiveness of this training will be put to the test once SAMIM ends, but it has already suffered a notable humiliation, losing at least eight men in an ambush in July, which was widely exploited by Islamic State propagandists.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Well, <a href=\"https://www.zitamar.com/sadc-confirms-drawdown-of-troops-from-cabo-delgado-has-begun/\">the foreign troops are withdrawing</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Southern African Development Community (SADC) has begun withdrawing its troops from Cabo Delgado province in preparation for a complete exit by 15 July this year, the organisation confirmed in a statement yesterday.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This article <a href=\"https://www.zitamar.com/what-does-the-end-of-samim-mean-for-cabo-delgado/\">&quot;What does the end of SAMIM (Southern African Development Community Mission in Mozambique) mean for Cabo Delgado (The Insurgency)&quot;</a> provides some interesting context. It looks like the Mozambique forces haven&#39;t been stunningly succesful, but SAMIM hasn&#39;t been succesful either. </p>\n\n<p>Questions I&#39;d like to know the answers to:\n- How contained is this insurgency?\n- How important is Cabo Delgado?\n- Will TotalEnergies will hire a PMC to provide security for their <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/totalenergies-restart-its-delayed-mozambique-lng-project-early-2024-sources-2023-12-22/#:%7E:text=Work%20on%20the%20project%20has,force%20majeure%20and%20halting%20construction.\">$20bn refinery</a> in Cabo Delgado?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>SAMIM\u2019s force consists of around 1,900 personnel, of whom just under 1,500 are from the South African National Defense Force, based in the embattled district of Macomia. The most significant consequence of the SAMIM withdrawal will be that it will force the Mozambican Armed Defense Forces (FADM) to fill the security vacuum these troops leave behind, but its performance so far has been far from encouraging. On 18 January, FADM abandoned the strategic village of Mucojo, effectively handing the insurgents unbridled access to the Macomia coast. Mozambican security forces are known to be suffering from a shortage of food and many soldiers have not been paid in months. If the Mozambican military is struggling to fulfil its current responsibilities, it is hard to imagine it coping with an expanded role when SAMIM departs.</p>\n\n<p>To offset the low morale of the rank and file infantry, the European Union has trained just over 1,000 members of a special forces unit, known as the Quick Reaction Force (QRF), since September 2022. The QRF should, in theory, be capable of carrying out offensive operations without the support of international forces. The effectiveness of this training will be put to the test once SAMIM ends, but it has already suffered a notable humiliation, losing at least eight men in an ambush in July, which was widely exploited by Islamic State propagandists. Five more European Union-trained marines were also ambushed and killed at Lake Nguri in Muidumbe district on 7 December.</p>\n\n<p>SAMIM\u2019s record has also been mixed. From the start, the mission was plagued by funding shortages and tensions with Mozambican forces, who have accused SAMIM of lacking initiative and failing to take the fight to the enemy. SAMIM\u2019s stated mission was to support FADM by \u201cneutralising\u201d the \u201cterrorist threat\u201d and \u201crestoring law and order.\u201d Given the capture of the Macomia coastline, which SADC troops were responsible for defending, this mission has hardly been fulfilled.

What are the possible advantages and disadvantages a tactic like this compared to the successful disposable infantry usage from Bakhmut and other urban battles? I could see it being used to find ATGM emplacements or draw fire, but that also sounds wasteful.\n\nThis! \n\nThe switch during Bakhmut onwards to dismounted infantry attacks only works in certain situations and locations. If there isn't cover and concealment and short distances from the assembly area before starting the approach march to get through \"no man's land,\" then there is a VERY good chance the assault force gets slaughtered along the way, potentially without the outpost line even needing to fire at them (drones will catch them, leading to mortars, arty, or FPV drones). \n\nEven if they do arrive at the enemy position, what can a dismounted squad take? What can a full platoon of multiple assault squads take? Likely only a squad sized position, which means the outposts only.\n\nRussian and Ukrainian defensive tactics call for platoon sized strongpoints (VOP), collections of mutually supporting positions that are heavily dug in, often holding key terrain that is defensible, that are protected by multiple squad sized or smaller outposts that are positioned 200-300 meters (or more), that must be taken first for the strongpoints to be taken. It'll be next to impossible for anything smaller than a platoon to take out a strongpoint themselves. And it seems they can't do anything bigger than platoon dismounted attacks due to the risk of what happens when they're detected (the very definition of target rich environment). \n\nSo likely they're using fires to do 90% of the work in forcing defenders to retreat from strongpoints after taking too much damage, while trying to either infiltrate around them to outflank them. But that'll be extremely costly for the attacking infantry, and takes very long. \n\nWhich means armored attacks will still be necessary, offensive progress will be impossible without them. \n\nIn the summer of 2022, Russia was doing platoon sized tank-IFV recon in force attacks as its bread and butter, similar to the later dismounted types. Force the defenses to reveal their position, to try to find weak points, to test the defenses after heavy bombardment, etc. Since then, defenses became stronger, more mines were laid, recon fires complex has much improved, so armored attacks have even less chance of succeeding unscathed. Hence the switch to try to focus on small unit dismounted attacks when possible, but they can't stop doing them.\n\nWith no way to reliably deny enemy drone recon, and with the need to conduct aggressive recon in force and deliberate attacks with armored forces, the Russians can expect to take heavy losses. If they use their best T90M tanks, those are going to take heavy losses. If they use T-55 refurb pieces of crap, those are going to take horrific losses. Currently, they seem to have the manpower to crew whatever, so it makes sense to use cheap armored vehicles for the cheap armored \"meat\" tactics.\n\nThe question is, will it actually matter? Good tanks or bad, can the Russians make the attacks work? And if they do work, is it because they came up with good tactics? Or because the UAF are suffering a manpower shortage, an ammo shortage, and are strategically making bad decisions? And if any or all get fixed, will it be a tactical stalemate again?",

If they use their best T90M tanks, those are going to take heavy losses. If they use T-55 refurb pieces of crap, those are going to take horrific losses. Currently, they seem to have the manpower to crew whatever, so it makes sense to use cheap armored vehicles for the cheap armored &quot;meat&quot; tactics.</p>\n\n<p>The question is, will it actually matter? Good tanks or bad, can the Russians make the attacks work? And if they do work, is it because they came up with good tactics? Or because the UAF are suffering a manpower shortage, an ammo shortage, and are strategically making bad decisions? And if any or all get fixed, will it be a tactical stalemate again?</p>\n</div>",

With a 300km outreach there is no safe space to conduct training within Ukraine so it will most obviously happen in the future again.\n\nInterestingly for me though, Russians once again show that it has a strange approach of always confirming their heavy losses (videos of OP\u2019s report are already out) and they have a consistent tendency to even keep attributing potential UA successes as their own self-inflicted faults like SU shootdown to their own AA malfunctioning.\n\nAs another counter-example, just recently it was reported a similar event happened nearby Avdiivka on UA side (not due to training, but general concentration of troops). I haven\u2019t seen videos from that one to confirm it since Ukraine is in full censorship mode for quite some time and I highly doubt that it happened in the scope that it was reported by Russians if it even happened to begin with.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, Russian media likes to assume fault as long as it shows little no agency from Ukrainian actions while usually Ukraine wants to achieve the same result by complete denial.\n\nIt\u2019s really fascinating how propaganda works on both sides and how it has different target groups and intended reactions from them.

With a 300km outreach there is no safe space to conduct training within Ukraine so it will most obviously happen in the future again.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly for me though, Russians once again show that it has a strange approach of always confirming their heavy losses (videos of OP\u2019s report are already out) and they have a consistent tendency to even keep attributing potential UA successes as their own self-inflicted faults like SU shootdown to their own AA malfunctioning.</p>\n\n<p>As another counter-example, just recently it was reported a similar event happened nearby Avdiivka on UA side (not due to training, but general concentration of troops). I haven\u2019t seen videos from that one to confirm it since Ukraine is in full censorship mode for quite some time and I highly doubt that it happened in the scope that it was reported by Russians if it even happened to begin with.</p>\n\n<p>As a rule of thumb, Russian media likes to assume fault as long as it shows little no agency from Ukrainian actions while usually Ukraine wants to achieve the same result by complete denial.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s really fascinating how propaganda works on both sides and how it has different target groups and intended reactions from them. Ukraine projects mostly to the West, while Russia is focusing on domestic audience much heavily. Even the recent Putin interview follows this trend.</p>\n</div>",

This has been the case since approximately 2007, which is when Denard scaling ended. Previously new process nodes meant higher clock rates with lower power and heat.
