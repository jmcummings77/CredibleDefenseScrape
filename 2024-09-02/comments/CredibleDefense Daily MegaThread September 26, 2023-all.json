As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

The points that are made are (1) China invading Taiwan would likely be the most ambitious amphibious invasion ever, (2) Chinese ships are at a disadvantage because the war would be happening next to their ports, so they'd have nowhere to hide out of the combat zone, (3) things like mines and anti-ship missiles would be a nightmare for anything trying to invade Taiwan, and (4) if China's invasion fails, it's likely over. If they lost their invasion fleet, it would take a long time to build a new one.\n\nI think there are a few reasons why people tend to focus on the American ships though. First, the US had the strongest military in the world, so the default assumption is sort of that the US wins. The question when looking at a conflict is how China might upset expectations, and the answer is taking out aircraft carriers, which means missiles. I think the assumption is that if American carriers all do fine, China is out of luck.\n\nSecond, the American fleets sort of have a single point of failure because if they lose their carrier, most of their offensive capabilities are gone. Contrast with China, who would be able to disperse aircraft because they'd largely be operating from land. So the possibility that some enormous missile blows up that carrier is obviously concerning.\n\nNow the US would likely have multiple aircraft carriers in the region, and some planes could fly from surrounding airbases, and possibly base aircraft on Taiwan (although it would likely be saturated by missiles) so it wouldn't necessarily determine the outcome of the war, but whether or not China can kill American carriers it's clearly one of the primary questions in the conflict.",

It's sounds relatively simple but the sheer weight of military equipment forces early design considerations. That makes it much harder to judge China's amphibious capabilities moving forwards.  \n\n\nGranted a Ro/Ro ferry isn't the same as an LPD, but it certainly adds significantly to the total amount of materiel that can be transported in that crucial window. Assuming China can establish a foothold in Taiwan, it's going to be up to China's substantial auxiliary and merchant maritime force to keep it supplied and create a logistical pipeline from the mainland.  \n\n\nAlso worth noting that of the US vessels recently constructed (the last 5 years or so)  many are relatively low capability LCS vessels, with 7 of them being Freedom Class, which have no ASW capability and a very limited ASuW capability. The Chinese Type 056A corvette (which makes up the ***32*** corvettes they produced in that same timeframe) is equipped with both a helicopter and ship based torpedo ASuW suite along with an ASW capability with it's YJ-83 missiles. That doesn't necessarily mean it's better for every role, but it's certainly a more capable surface combatant than the Freedom class which is a subclass of LCS that the US is already eyeing up for early decommissioning, with 4 vessels slated for early retirement this year.  \n\n\nThe next four years is going to be crucial for the PLAN and conversely for the USN. The PLAN is going to continue to consolidate on its ship building investments with further Type 055 and Type 052D batches, the new Type 003 carrier is going to enter active service alongside a continuing expansion of their amphibious capabilities with additional Type 075s entering service, of which another is nearing completion. The grinder will continue to pump out hulls as it has done at an impressive pace for the past two decades now.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOver the last five years the PLAN added 721,000 tonnes of vessels.\n\nAircraft Carriers: +2 (1 fitting out, soon to be active.)  \nDestroyers: +26 (1 fitting out, soon to be active.)  \nFrigates: +8 (3 fitting out, soon to be active.)  \nCorvettes: + 34  \nAmphibious transport docks: +7  \nSubmarines: + 6 (2 fitting out, soon to be active.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor comparison the USN added 487,000 tonnes of vessels.\n\nAircraft Carriers: + 1 (fitting out, soon to be active.)  \nAmphibious assault ship: + 1  \nDestroyers: + 12 (3 fitting out, soon to be active.)  \nLCS: + 23 (4 fitting out, soon to be active.)  \nAmphibious transport docks: + 2 (1 fitting out, soon to be active.)  \nSubmarines: + 9 (2 fitting out, soon to be active.)  \n\n\n  \nWorth noting here that the JFK is set for 2025 delivery with rumours that it will continue to slip, so including it in the aircraft carrier category is being generous at best.\n\nThe only category that the US leads in here is Submarines, but it's arguable to say that is by necessity as the decommissioning of Los Angeles class submarines is set to outpace the construction of Virginia class replacements. Many of these boats are nearing 40 years of active and hard service, it would be a well deserved decommissioning.\n\n**Nine** Los Angeles class vessels are being eyed up for decommissioning over the next four years. In that timespan if production ramps without any issues they'll complete anywhere between 4 and 6 Virginia class vessels. Hardly a like for like replacement, and this is coming off the backs of a submarine deficit as Los Angeles class vessels have already been hitting the chopping block for quite some time now.\n\nOntop of this the USN is set to lose a further **Thirteen** Ticonderoga class cruisers as the class enters full retirement. What makes matters worse here is that the early Arleigh Burke flight I's are coming up for decommissioning soon as well. We might find them pressed into increasingly longer service lives as the alternative, retirement, would start to strip further capability from the USN.  \n\n\nThis \"squeeze\" is going to continue to get worse as we wait for the Constellation to find its footing (which is going to take several years at a minimum) and the DDG(X) to enter mass production, which isn't set until approximately 2028, and that's assuming we don't have a repeat of the last clean sheet destroyer debacle. USN procurement has been utter garbage for quite a while now. They're being cautious with Constellation as they got heavily burned with LCS and Zumwalt, an entirely fair position to have, if we weren't nearing the decommissioning of a very large number of vessels, of which there is no direct replacement because the last 20 years have been squandered on test bed ships and exploratory projects.",

The sensor apparatus to detect the carrier group. Then it has to verify that it isn't just seeing some spurious electronic-warfare ghost. Then someone in the chain of command has to make the decision to launch a strike. The strike units have to be briefing, their aircraft prepped.

They rely on drones for their own operations for C4ISR. And they use unsecure tactical comms, UA for company operations and under, especially dismounted, and supposedly battalion level and under for the Russians). </p>\n\n<p>If they attack their opponent&#39;s electronic spectrum, how can they avoid degrading their own at the same time? </p>\n\n<p>Another guess, I think they treat EW similar to a planned artillery strike, with units told in advance as part of mission plans pushed down from brigade or higher that such and such location and time, there will be EW turned on. And if they can&#39;t risk it due to friendly collateral damage, they don&#39;t use it, while hoping the enemy doesn&#39;t either for the same fratricide risk.</p>\n</div>",

Yet there are increasing indications that the attack was carried out by a Ukrainian team. Joint investigations by several European media, including NOS and Nieuwsuur, led to the identification of two people involved. According to sources close to the German criminal investigation, there is a growing conviction that the perpetrators came from Ukraine.\n> \n> The joint investigation also sheds new light on the route taken by the sailing yacht from which the attack was allegedly carried out. The media also spoke to new eyewitnesses who saw the crew of the vessel.  \n> \n> Never before has there been an attack on European soil with such extensive material damage. The pipelines, which transported Russian gas directly to Germany, cost billions of euros. This is why, for almost a year now, German, Swedish and Danish intelligence and investigation agencies have been trying to find out who was behind the attack. The Dutch military intelligence service MIVD plays a major role in this.\n> \n> At the centre of the mystery is the Andromeda - a nondescript sailing yacht that caught the attention of the German police. In September of 2022, the vessel was rented for a few weeks by a Polish letterbox company. The official suspicion is that an unknown team of five men and a woman applied explosives to the pipelines, working from the Andromeda at least a week before they exploded.\n> \n> That theory is further confirmed by the discovery of powder residue on the boat's table. The residue shows HMX, a powerful explosive used mainly by the military, which works under water. It matches powder residue found on the pipeline.  \n\n> **Ukrainian men**\n> \n> European media investigations now reveal that 41-year-old Ukrainian businessman Rustem A. is behind the Polish company that paid for the lease of the suspect vessel. Little is known about the Kyiv-based man except that a company of his has been the subject of a money-laundering investigation, and that he is decidedly pro-Ukraine. The German criminal investigation team also has the man in its sights, according to sources. A. and his lawyer refused to answer any questions. A team of journalists visited his home, in the course of which he threatened them.\n> \n> The booking was allegedly made from the email address of a second person, a 28-year-old man from Mariupol, Ukraine. Copies of two forged passports were sent in with the reservation form. He works for a company providing facility support to the shipping industry. German sources close to the investigation confirm that the Ukrainian is a prominent person of interest, but say they do not know whether the man was used or really involved. The man denies having sent the email.\n> \n> Earlier, it became clear that one of the two fake passports shows the photo of Valeri K., a Ukrainian soldier. Conclusive evidence that he was actually involved was not found on the Andromeda: the German police compared DNA from his son, who lives in Germany, with traces on the boat, but there was no match. To whom the photo on the other passport belongs is not known. What is certain, sources say, is that phones which were used on board the boat were later also used in Ukraine.  \n\n>**MIVD**\n> \n> The role of the Dutch MIVD (Dutch Military Intelligence and Security Service) in the investigation has been crucial. While German forensic investigators were looking into the sailing vessel and its crew, MIVD received new information about the potential operators behind the attacks. Earlier investigations by NOS, Nieuwsuur and German media revealed that an MIVD source from Ukraine passed on information bout an imminent attack three months before it took place.\n> \n> According to the source, an element of the Ukrainian army was planning an attack from a harbour near Stockholm. They would travel to Sweden using fake Eastern European passports, and rent a boat there. The sabotage was to take place on 19 June, under the guise of a diving expedition to a shipwreck. The Ukrainian army leadership was said to be aware of the plot. Based on the MIVD information, the CIA warned authorities in Ukraine not to carry out an attack.\n> \n> Later, when an attack had taken place in September, the MIVD received new information from Ukraine. MIVD learned that the attack had been carried out by a team of six Ukrainian special forces. According to a source, the team had rented a boat in Rostock. This put German investigators on the trail of the Andromeda,\n> \n> Should it turn out that a team from Ukraine is indeed involved, it would be a very uncomfortable outcome for the West. \"Any deliberate disruption of the European energy infrastructure is unacceptable\", the European Commission said the day after the attack . Ukraine receives military support from Western European countries and is keen to join NATO. For this reason the investigation into what happened is shrouded in extreme secrecy.  \n\n> **Route reconstructed**\n> \n> The investigation by NOS and Nieuwsuur, among others, has also made it clearer which route the Andromeda sailed. After leaving Germany, the vessel was sighted a week later in the southern Swedish port of Sandhamn. Several eyewitnesses saw the sailing yacht there. This makes it even more plausible that the boat was at the locations where the sabotage took place, as it had to sail more or less past them.  \n> \n> One of the eyewitnesses in Sandhamn had a minor run-in with the six-member crew as they were unwilling to help another skipper who wanted to dock. \"They looked a bit like soldiers, that is, tough people, reasonably well educated, relatively young.\"\n> \n> The skipper said he could not identify the Slavic language they spoke. As different eyewitnesses have different accounts of the language they spoke, their nationality can't be determined with complete certainty.\n> \n> Meanwhile, German sources close to the investigation emphasise that although everything points to Ukraine, there is still no conclusive evidence.

            "body": "ISW is such a joke. Anyone who thinks otherwise needs to read the bios of the authors of their reports and explain how these people are military experts. They aren't, they are a bunch of Ivy League rich kids with master's in international relations or other POL SCI degrees with Russian language skills so they can translate Tiktok and Telegram posts without Google.\n\nUkraine's defensive \"Way of War\" can be defined as the Zelensky Administration's way of war, which is Hold At All Cost positional defenses. Members of the RUSI staff (who are far more credible than ISW) have said multiple times that the UAF preferred a maneuver defense strategy in the Donbas but were denied for political reasons. Those same political reasons have dominated all UAF defensive operations since. Their defensive strategy is terrible, it values land over it's own people, they routinely volunteer for meatgrinder fights with terrain a first year ROTC student should know is worthless because they are worried about the optics of a loss, so they routinely double down on terrible battles (the Russian Donbas Salient offensive, Bakhmut, Kupyansk-Svatove-Kreminna).\n\nIt's offensive way of war is the exact type this article is projecting is wrong for NATO to pressure on Ukraine: mechanized combined arms attacks trying to achieve a rapid breakthrough .

The issue with that is:\n\n1. Ukraine is never going to get the fire support needed for that. He's essentially saying the West should support Ukraine doing what Russia did last summer in the Donbas, because that helps them make incremental gains. The West could barely sustain that logistical burden for itself, even in 2024-5 when future munition production increases go into effect, Ukraine is not going to be able use those tactics. \n2. The impatience of the West wont support a decade long super-costly meatgrinder war to liberate territory to get back to the Feb 23, '22 lines. Not only can't we logistically support it, the western leadership and their populations don't want to support it. That is why there is so much reporting lately about needing to embrace the long war, they need to say that because many haven't. Long term support isn't universal or guaranteed, so their tactics shouldn't reflect it.   \n3. it fully embraces inefficiency. There is no reason the Ukrainians can't get better at warfare and instead need to dumb everything down to the level of the typical Russian motor rifle regiment in order to move forward. They are doing that because they don't have other options, because frankly they aren't very good. The fix is to get better. And hopefully NATO can help them with that, but realistically Ukrainian needs to be on point to fix themselves.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>and that it was a mistake for the West and NATO to push them to embrace NATO doctrine when they realistically didn't have the time and resources to assimilate and execute it successfully.\n\nThis is the part I don't understand.\n\nFirst, what exactly do they think NATO was pushing on them?\n\nClearly not \"maneuver warfare,\" because Ukraine launched a bunch of mechanized attacks and offensives in '22 emphasizing that, using the exact same tactics that NATO was promoting and that they tried in Orihkiv and elsewhere since this offensive started. Many times they worked, especially at Kharkiv in September '22. Other times they didn't. But that was clearly not forced on them in '22 by NATO, that was their own choice this time and before.\n\nAnd I don't think NATO forced them to attack the strongest Russian position in Ukraine with the most elaborately constructed defense in depth (with three operational level lines, more than any other place in Ukraine). Or to underestimate the Russian will to fight. To use inadequately trained brigades as their main effort. To largely brush off the minefields, to utterly discount the Lancet threat despite winter-spring fighting at Bakhmut showing the Russians were mass producing them and had created effective TTPs to use them, while totally ignoring the possibility of KA-52 showing up to do the job they were designed to do. Ukraine did all that, not NATO, and those are largely why the Orikhiv axis is so problematic.\n\nSo what could NATO have told them that doesn't apply?\n\nWe'd have pushed them to use trained troops, to have battalion and brigade command and staff trained and experienced to conduct highly planned, coordinated and synchronized operations. But the Ukrainians can't do that at the moment with brand new brigades because they didn't train them for that and they aren't experienced enough to know how, with most of the UAF apparently unable as well (that is an internal problem).\n\nAdditionally, NATO probably would have told them to use certain tactics, techniques, and procedures the UAF chose not to. For example, RUSI reported that UAF commanders don't like using smoke rounds for artillery because it obscures the battlefield too much, which negatively affects their or arty FOs ability to view it from drone footage while sitting in rear area command posts. That's a problem.\n\nThe US Army, who ran the combined arms training the UAF got over the winter and spring, follow a fundamentals of breaching acronym of SOSRA. The O stands for obscuration, which is utterly critical for breaching operations to prevent enemy from seeing and engaging the breaching/assault elements. And yet faced with a mission where the Russians are dug in at an unprecedented level, the UAF choose not to use a century old means of hiding from the enemy despite being exposed and moving. Got hemmed up with ATGMs and Lancets, many or most of which DON'T have thermal sights that can see through the smoke, and blamed NATO...\n\nThis war is hard enough that the UAF can't afford screwups. Kofman's and the ISW's suggestions are that the world should accept substandard performance out of the UAF because they aren't capable of doing better, so their forced to use \"Short Bus\" TTPs. I disagree, the UAF GenStab and NATO need to work together to fix the training and thus combat effectiveness at all levels.\n\nWhile the UA political leadership needs to lower to OPTEMPO to make that possible, which is probably the biggest reason things are screwed up. The UAF leaders likely know and want to train more. Why can't they? Because they are nearly always involved in at least one major high intensity operation that they didn't actually plan to be in, usually more than one, which sucks in manpower and resources and makes it impossible to better prepare for future operations. They get involved in those campaigns, ones they often fail at, because they are afraid of the optics of failure. They need to embrace that in warfare you can't win every battle, you need to pick and choose. Until they do, they are going to put a strain on the UAF that will make it impossible to improve in quality, while also using up their available strategic manpower reserves with senseless casualties that didn't help their overall strategic situation one bit.",

I went on a \"what would I do\" rant about what Ukraine should to to improve offensive capabilities. \n\nA [follow on post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uy5zcd/comment/ia571y4/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) to that one stands out in particular with this topic, and I think it's as true now as the day I wrote it: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I'm not sure I like the idea of NATO troops running their training. Just speaking for the US, unless we're using SF or SFAB it'll be probably be mediocre training at best, especially considering the language barriers. It briefs well but having done lots of instruction to include foreign troops it's not our strong suit.\r  \n\r  \nI think the Ukrainians should be trained by their own people as much as possible. Not only would it be better instruction to have Ukrainians train Ukrainians, that would be a terrific way to rotate veterans out of the fight for 6 months or so at a time, and it spreads the lessons learned directly to those who need it. Using them as the actual instructors NATO could teach the advanced technical stuff and handle everything else like logistics, admin, running ranges, etc\n\nOverall, I was spot on with everything other than needing to be good at urban operations, but that's mostly because the UAF managed to avoid fighting any big ones while on the offensive yet. The Russians clearly proved during their previous offensives that they can't always bypass but that they need to know how to do it.

I went on a &quot;what would I do&quot; rant about what Ukraine should to to improve offensive capabilities. </p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/uy5zcd/comment/ia571y4/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">follow on post</a> to that one stands out in particular with this topic, and I think it&#39;s as true now as the day I wrote it: </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I&#39;m not sure I like the idea of NATO troops running their training. Just speaking for the US, unless we&#39;re using SF or SFAB it&#39;ll be probably be mediocre training at best, especially considering the language barriers. It briefs well but having done lots of instruction to include foreign troops it&#39;s not our strong suit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I think the Ukrainians should be trained by their own people as much as possible. Not only would it be better instruction to have Ukrainians train Ukrainians, that would be a terrific way to rotate veterans out of the fight for 6 months or so at a time, and it spreads the lessons learned directly to those who need it. Using them as the actual instructors NATO could teach the advanced technical stuff and handle everything else like logistics, admin, running ranges, etc</p>\n\n<p>Overall, I was spot on with everything other than needing to be good at urban operations, but that&#39;s mostly because the UAF managed to avoid fighting any big ones while on the offensive yet. The Russians clearly proved during their previous offensives that they can&#39;t always bypass but that they need to know how to do it. That said, its not the priority for Ukraine that I thought it would be.</p>\n</div>",

Their original plan isn't going to work but they're still pressing it. The Melitopol axis is a terrible location to keep attacking because not only is it the most heavily defended area in Ukraine, but the very reason to make Melitopol the strategic goal isn't valid because it's too far away and the idea that they can breakthrough, cut the Land Bridge, and then swing west to the Isthmus of Perekop to invade or threaten Crimes is fantasy at this point. But they're still doing it. \n\nBesides that, they don't have unlimited manpower, especially not trained. Their offensive ready units entered this actual limited offensive capabilities and they can very well lose offensive capabilities if they remain so. They are already having issues with conscription and finding more bodies, Zelensky felt the need to fire every regional military recruitment commander in August because it was so screwed up.

To create a new offensive force without creating new units, they need to find a way to pull enough quality existing units off the line that are currently fighting to prep them for a later offensive.\n\nOver the winter, spring and since the offensive started, the UAF were injected with many hundreds of thousands of artillery shells they desperately needed. But there is no major future resupply unless some international partner opens up their strategic stockpiles again, which is questionable at best. So they're sitting on a limited quantity, at least until late 2024 and into 2025 when US production increases go on line. Meanwhile, they're pursuing a fires centric approach to this campaign, and planning to maintain it for months. If they want to do a future operation, they cant use up most of their stockpile.\n\nEquipment wise, they have Abrams coming, but only enough for a brigade or so, likely going to an existing unit to replace what they already lost. There are no major future plans for more IFV, and while the US can randomly send them lots of MRAPs, those are the wrong vehicles for this type of war. \n\nAnd now they are saying this offensive is going to last through the winter and maybe into the spring. That can be hype, trying to scare the Russians. Or they might be sustaining it simply because they really believe the Russians will break if they keep pressing. Or maybe it's politically easier to keep it going than to stop it and have the offensive be declared a defeat, with all that entails (potential major strategic changes, ie important people getting fired). Or maybe keeping this offensive going allows them to not worry about planning a future offensive.\n\nWhatever the reason, the longer this offensive lasts, the less they'll be prepared for a future different offensive because they're burning through the resources they'd need for future ops. \n\nSo no, I don't really think the UAF GenStab or UA political leadership have a clear picture of future ops in 2024.",

Like you said, they knew there were land mines. They knew from past experiences in Kherson they didn't have a solution for them.

But its totally me who is racist sure.\n\nAnd prior to that you went \"Arabs are crap, there is nothing to learn from them\".\n\nand in the earlier post you were making some Darwinism style organizations \"Arab are not true race.

Just a fact.</p>\n\n<p>That is why I said I was only half surprised.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>While I never said any of the cultural traits were shared by every Arab, specifically saying they weren&#39;t, you just negatively type classed me based on my blood.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I could use the same trick like you did earlier and say I was not talking about 100% of all Lebanese.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>If fact, since you do think Arab is a racist, you&#39;re racist.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I guess you mean race ? Well just at the beginning of your post you said &quot;Race are this and that&quot;. So are you racists too ?</p>\n\n<p>Dude, a few sentences earlier you were like &quot;We can totally make generalization&quot; as Arabs are this, Americans are that to push the idea that Arabs are stupid and incapables in warfare. Then wrote the obligatory &quot;I am not talking about 100% of them&quot; which never convinces anybody. But its totally me who is racist sure.</p>\n\n<p>And prior to that you went &quot;Arabs are crap, there is nothing to learn from them&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>and in the earlier post you were making some Darwinism style organizations &quot;Arab are not true race. Contrary to Semitic. Which are diluted Arabs compared to Saudi&quot;. Like wtf ?</p>\n\n<p>But sure you are totally not bigot. I am.</p>\n</div>",

Because it's not even a good outcome, at best it's a shaping operation for a second offensive that actually reaches the coast.\n\nAnd that was exactly what they were advertising since December, when Zelenky and Zaluzhny were telling the US in particular that if they were given more military aid (and they got most of what they asked for), they'd be able to liberate prewar territory (Zaluzhny's claim) or all of Crimea (Zelensky's claim). Those pledges seem to be what unlocked more foreign military aid then ever before, especially advanced ground vehicles, that allowed for this offensive to happen, which was supposed to launch in the spring, was the first part of that.\n\nThe way military operations tend to work is first the top political and military leadership creates a strategy, how they want to do something that will work towards winning the war. The strategy leads to a goal, which is the planned military and political outcome. Based on the strategy, an operation is conceived, a military campaign for which the strategy will unfold, while the tactics are how to fight the battles of the campaign.\n\nIn the case of the very telegraphed Ukraine Summer 2023 offensive, the strategic goal was to cut the Land Bridge and put pressure on Crimea by reaching Melitipol by way of the Orikhiv-Tokmat axis as the main effort, to pressure Berdyansk by way of the Velyka Novosilka supporting axis, and to attack Bakhmut as the supporting axis, with the latter two to fix Russian troops and divert their reserves.\n\nAt the Orikhiv axis, the 9th Corps was supposed to rapidly breakthrough the Russian defenses, and then the 10th Corps was supposed to act as the exploitation force to bypass major cities while reaching the Sea of Azov at numerous locations. That's evident because only the 9th Corps attacked first, and then they committed the 10th Corps in late July after 9th Corps units were too exhausted to continue alone, and the need to mass more units to achieve results.\n\nThe UAF intelligence estimate of the Russians showcases their expectations, they greatly underestimated the Russians, and they've said so many times. If they underestimated them, they thought they'd go further. They weren't prepared for the reality, which led to a lack of preparedness and staggering losses, forcing them to commit their strategic exploitation reserve element far earlier than anticipated, more so, far shorter of where they were meant to go, and why they were honestly talking openly about the schedule being way off as far back as early July. And then needing to totally change their strategic approach to positional warfare through a fires centric attritional campaign.\n\nOther evidence pointing that this was the only offensive being planned in the future is the recent leaks to Western press that there is no other major allotment of kit that the West can donate to the UAF, aside from Abrams and a few other belated Leopard shipments, this was largely it.\n\nAnd why ATACMS were finally given up despite Biden obviously not wanting to give them up.\n\nIt does not seem the Ukrainians were at all planning for failure, which is why things have changed so much in the last 3.75 months.",

What I believe will likely prove most problematic, assuming any conflict takes place within the first island chain and possibly within the second, is the combination of limited US magazine depth, incredibly dense Chinese sensor networks, and China\u2019s massive arsenal of ASM\u2019s that can be launched from any number of platforms (ships, planes, TELs, etc) that themselves contribute towards the aforementioned sensor networks.\n\nLimited magazine depth means the USN must make choices between equipping defensive interceptor missiles or offensive strike missiles on their LSC\u2019s with few resupply opportunities. Furthermore, those interceptors aren\u2019t \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d. They perform optimally at various ranges/altitudes, of which the Chinese arsenal runs the entire gamut. This is further complicated by that fact that they\u2019ll almost certainly perform multi-axis, coordinated raid attacks.\n\nHowever, missiles do rely on sensors to actually guide towards the general target area before activating terminal guidance. Unfortunately, China knows this and has implemented an incredibly dense sensor network within the first island chain. These sensors include mainland radars, PLAN ship radars, and airborne platforms. These are all integrated into a sensor network designed to not only guide ASM but also A2A missiles. \n\n(On a related note regarding missile defense is that a USN ship, in such a hostile environment, may choose to remain in EMCON to prevent passive detection. However, this has obvious drawbacks in that it is also now forced to rely on passive ES to detect threats. A bit of a dammed if you do, damned if you don\u2019t situation.)\n\nUltimately, the issue is there are too many missiles that know where we are.\n\nNow I\u2019m gonna put on my r/NCD armchair admiral cap. In my opinion:\nShould a conflict show signs of breaking out, the USN needs to pull all the assets it can out of the first island chain ASAP to either within the second island chain (and maintain constant vigilance) or even outside it. It needs to gather and consolidate ships, either from other fleets or allied states. From there, operations need to be done in bursts. Groups of ships, CBGs, task forces, etc, need to be relatively dispersed with enough in each group to provide credible air defense (but not enough to create a tempting target for China to blow a large load on) outside the first island chain. Opportunities to strike must be identified and strikes must be hard and fast with overwhelming local superiority. See a PLAN task force hovering a bit too close to the first island chain or a bit too far from supporting assets? Immediately coalesce smaller groups of US vessels/planes into one large force, move forward to strike, then get the hell out of dodge while dispersing again. Of course, this is all easier said than done. It relies on the US operational tempo to be much faster and responsive than the PLA kill web.\n\nAs for Taiwan? Abandon it for now. Only once enough PLA assets have been destroyed can reclamation operations start.\n\nI also don\u2019t really follow PLAGF developments aside from \u201ccool gun\u201d or \u201ccool tank\u201d. I find the PLAGF mostly irrelevant for any conflict between the China and the US.

Preparing to launch the UMPC series of 1500 kg calibers. Now the cases of their use in the Northern Military District, although very epic, are still isolated.\nThe next factor is the firmware for the ability to operate this weapon on virtually all Su-34 series. Plus, they can also operate on other types of front-line aircraft. Even the Su-24 has learned.\nNext comes the ease of use of this ammunition and the rapid retraining of flight personnel for it. Since ancient times, it has been the custom that it is easiest to work with a \u201csmart\u201d weapon, and the most difficult to hit with a \u201cdull\u201d cast iron.\n\nIn conditions of interference, dozens of crews can fly to a target with assault cast-iron bombs at an altitude of 25-50 meters and at a speed of over a thousand, skirting the terrain, finding a target, aiming and hitting it. Only a few can do this at night.\n\nAnd even college students who have recently graduated from their aviation courses can use the UMPC. You don't need much intelligence there. Which is what they are already doing.\nEngineers have also mastered this weapon and now the suspension of the UMPC takes much less time than at the beginning of the UMPC's march around the planet.\nWell, the tireless improvement of the UMPC in the form of upgrading the software, adding a feature for entering target coordinates in the air at any time before reset, the development of new ways to use this ammunition, coupled with the enormous power of cast iron, of course, added to the efficiency of aviation.\nYes, you need to understand that this scam may end in one day. The day when the West will figure out how to suppress correction signals from its satellites, ours, Chinese and others. They can't yet. And this is good. UMPCs will continue to fly for some time, but the accuracy will be near zero.
