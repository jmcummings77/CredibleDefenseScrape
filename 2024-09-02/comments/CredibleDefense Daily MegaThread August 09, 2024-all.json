            "body": "The statements from the Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh. The first statement seems to continue the slight ambiguity about whether Ukraine can't hit Russia at all, or just cross border but not deeper. However the second statement does suggest support for the Kursk operation.\n\nQ: Can you provide us an update on Ukraine's incursion into Kursk? Is that consistent with the United States's sort of understanding of what Ukraine can and cannot do with US weapons?\n\nSABRINA SINGH: Thanks for the question. So yes, it is. It is consistent with our policy and we have supported Ukraine from the very beginning to defend themselves against attacks that are coming across the border and for the need for crossfires. So they are taking actions to protect themselves from attacks that are coming from a region that are within the US policy of where they can operate, you know, our weapons, our systems, our capabilities. In terms of this actual operation that's ongoing in the Kursk region that you've referenced, I'd refer you to the Ukrainians to speak more to that. We are getting more information, but really it's for them to speak to their own operations.\n\nQ: So is the policy then essentially wherever they see an attack emanating from or grouping of troops, so could that include Moscow as well, if they saw some sort of preparation for them to then go into Moscow, is that that \u2014\n\nSABRINA SINGH: Again, we don't support long range attacks into Russia. These are more for crossfire. I'm not going to put a specific range on it. As you know \u2014\n\nQ: \u2014 Do they know what the limit is?\n\nSABRINA SINGH: \u2014 They (Ukrainians) are aware of the US policy and what we are supportive of. I think you know from the very beginning we are supportive of Ukraine and their success on the battlefield. But as the dynamics have shifted on the battlefield, they've been able to actually push the Russians back further into Russian territory. But as they see attacks coming across the border, they have to be able to have the capabilities to respond. And so you're seeing some of these cross-border counter fire measures that they're being able to take that are near the border of Ukraine.\n\nWe don't support long range attacks into (Russia). We've said that from the very beginning. I'm not going to draw, you know, a circular map here for you of where they can and can't strike, but we've been very clear with the Ukrainians.\n\n...\n\nQ: Yeah. Thanks. So, just on the Ukraine attacks into Russia, are you concerned that Russia will escalate tensions over this attack, including with the US, nuclear threats, anything like that?\n\nSABRINA SINGH: No, because at the end of the day, Ukraine is fighting for its sovereign territory that its neighbor invaded. So, if we want to de-escalate tensions, as we've said\n\nfrom the beginning, the best way to do that is Putin can make that decision today to withdraw troops from Ukraine.\n\nUkraine is going to do everything it can to continue to take back its sovereign territory. And that's what we're seeing they're doing in this \u2014 what you're referring to in this, you know, Kursk Oblast. We're going to continue to support Ukraine with the capabilities and the systems that they need. We don't feel like this is escalatory in any way. Ukraine is doing what it needs to do to be successful on the battlefield.\n\nhttps://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/3867296/deputy-pentagon-press-secretary-sabrina-singh-holds-a-press-conference/",

        "body": "New quick update on the order of battle of the offensive operations in Kursk Oblast, after [yesterday's](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/1en43c9/comment/lh7jifj/). \n\nOn the Ukrainian side, there is still no official confirmation regarding the involvement of the 22nd Mechanized Brigade, but the evidence does speak in favor of that, as these [two posts](https://i.imgur.com/gx3BItN.png) suggest.\n\nAs for the 80th Air Assault Brigade, we had already seen yesterday that there was an official confirmation. Today I found [two obituaries](https://i.imgur.com/6blprb1.png) of soldiers from this brigade who died in Sumy Oblast (likely Kursk) on August 6 and 7. That might have been the main unit that led the offensive actions in the first day. \n\nThere is still no official confirmation for the 82nd Air Assault Brigade, but [this post](https://i.imgur.com/PzbxVtK.png) is quite telling (note how it refers to its 12th Company, of the 3rd Battalion). Also, this brigade has recently [been equipped](https://mil.in.ua/en/news/82nd-air-assault-brigade-received-cougar-armored-vehicles/) with Cougar MRAPs (in addition to Strykers, also used by the 80th Brigade, and Marders).\n\nToday a video was released, showing soldiers from the 99th Mech Battalion of the 61st Mech Brigade in the western outskirts of Sudzha. \n\nhttps://t. me/mysiagin/30069\n\nLet's recall that this brigade suffered very heavy losses west of Avdiivka between late February and March. After that, it was withdrawn and sent to Kharkiv Oblast to build fortifications while it regained combat capability. Last month elements of this brigade were attached to the 72nd Mech Brigade to face Russian attacks in the direction of Vodiane (north-east of Vuhledar), but evidently other elements are participating in the offensive operations in Kursk Oblast. Nice OpSec by the Ukrainians, by the way - there was no evidence that the 61st Mech Brigade might be involved. In any case, when we talk about brigades, we are talking about elements, generally. \n\nThis afternoon this photo had come out, released by the \"Bravo Team\", which should be a detachment of the 130th Separate Reconnaissance Battalion. \n\nhttps://t. me/BRAVO_Team_chanel/55 \n\nThere is also presence of units of the Alpha Group of the SBU. In contrast, there is no evidence of the involvement of units of the HUR (this does not mean at all that they could not be there!). \n\n\"Khorne Group\" - the UAV unit of the 116th Mech Brigade - is definitely involved in the operations, but there is no evidence yet to know if the rest of the brigade is involved too. In any case, the presence of elements from numerous brigades is potentially a sign that this operation is of a certain size and importance, in scope and purpose. \n\nThe 103rd TDF Brigade seems to be involved in the actions, as highlighted by [this post](https://i.imgur.com/gM37Fki.png). They are probably the ones consolidating the positions the others have gained. There are units that are advancing and those that are dealing with tasks in the rear, as highlighted here. \n\nhttps://t. me/officer_alex33/3440 \n\nReinforcements continue to flow into the Pokrovsk sector as well. In addition to those we had seen in the last few days, it also appears that the 35th Regiment of the National Guard, which was covering the border in Sumy Oblast, has been moved there. In their FB page today they posted that the regiment is now fighting in the Pokrovsk sector, and a soldier from this unit was taken prisoner by stormtroopers of the 74th Motorized Brigade (41st CAA) in Ivanivka, claiming that he arrived in early August from Sumy. Some Russian channels have tried to pass off the video as the capture of an Ukrainian soldier in Kursk Oblast.\n\nhttps://t. me/urga_74/1484 \n\nAs for the Russians, in addition to the units mentioned yesterday, there should also be a battalion of the Motorized Regiment of the Aerospace Forces (a new unit), which was covering the border in Kursk Oblast. Russian sources had also reported the arrival, a few weeks ago, of sailors from the Northern Fleet, which were supposed to cover the border with Sumy Oblast but instead participated in the failed assaults on Sotnytskyi Kozachok. \n\nhttps://t. me/severnnyi/1619\n\nRussian sources report the transfer to Kursk of the Assault and Recon Brigade \"Hispaniola\" of the Cossack Volunteer Assault Corps, from the Chasiv Yar sector (actually a reinforced battalion, like the rest of the brigades of this corps), along with the \"Rusich\" Group. It is also reported that the \"Pyatnashka\" Brigade (actually a battalion) is already involved in the fighting, as are the units of the \"Akhmat Special Forces\" that arrived as reinforcements. \n\nhttps://t. me/vdv_za_chestnost_spravedlivost/3515\n\nThere was a big controversy in Russian media after Kadyrovites kidnapped a Russian conscript and forced him to apologize for saying that these were hiding behind conscripts (something claimed by a lot of Russian sources). They did a quite similar thing with the milblogger Romanov a month ago.\n\nhttps://t. me/wind_sower/6686\n\nhttps://t. me/romanov_92/44837\n\nThe first MIA notices are coming out. Here we can see two, involving conscripts from the 488th Motorized Regiment (144th Motorized Division, 20th CAA). There is no evidence that the rest of the regiment, engaged in the Lyman sector, is in the area.\n\nhttps://t. me/poisk_in_ua/71184\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/xznxNng.png\n\nIn the 3 days leading up to the beginning of the offensive operations, a Russian POW from the FSB reported massive Ukrainian drone and artillery activity, which caused major losses to the conscripts. \n\nhttps://t. me/WarArchive_ua/18303\n\nThis news is not verified, but a woman who left her village (Guevo, south of Sudhza), reports 120 conscripts KIAs around the village area. \n\nhttps://t. me/severnnyi/1686\n\nWith the arrival of these reinforcements, it's likely that the Russians will be able to stabilize the situation, but it remains to be seen what's their plan in order to regain the ground that has been lost.\n\nMoreover, it appears that the Russians, in addition to the transfer of units from the \"SMO\" area that we saw yesterday and today, are also transferring conscripts from other areas of Russia. Being the battles within legit Russian territory, there are no restrictions on their use. In this video, a volunteer fighting in the \"SMO\" complains that his brother, as part of a group of 90 conscripts from the 1st Tank Regiment (2nd Motorized Division, 1st GTA), is being transferred to Kursk Oblast, despite having fired just 3 times overall during training and having a brother already fighting. \n\nhttps://t. me/ne_zhdi_novosti/659",

It&#39;s frankly ridiculous to envision some kind of Iran-EU collaboration if not for US sanctions. Iran is theocratic autocracy with both economic and geopolitical goals that conflict with EU members. They also have a longstanding history financing terror that has killed EU civilians and hold values that are both antithetical and unpalatable to the majority of EU voters.</p>\n</div>",

Something that occured to me is that if the AFU plans on staying then the town is effectively a hostage. As can be seen in Ukraine, Russia's urban warfare strategy involves heavy use of artillery while Ukraine's involves slowly giving up ground while making a slow, fighting retreat through the dense urban landscape. What I'm getting is that Russia may end up completely leveling one of their own towns that is currently home to thousands of people. What's also significant is that both a gas pipeline and a railway pass through Sudzha, meaning that the occupation and destruction of the city will have ramifications far beyond the immediate area.

If they had a second force standing by to throw at more protracted defenses in their way, they should have used it in the first two days of the action before those defenses could even be formed.</p>\n\n<p>It is possible they try launching a different attack in a different location like Belgorod, but I think the window for such an attack is closing or might already have closed. The Russian forces in Belgorod are probably on high alert, and Russian commanders are seeing ghosts right now, with an endless stream of false reports of sightings of massed Ukrainian units waiting to launch more attacks.</p>\n</div>",

It's the classic security dilemma, where both sides \"build up to ensure deterrence and prevent a war,\" which ironically is interpreted by the other side as an aggressive provocation, which justifies further escalation in the arms race. . . \n\nAs we've seen over the last few years, the US hasn't really been able to disengage from its other security commitments in order to truly \"pivot to Asia.\" Eastern Europe is in open conflict, and even if the Ukraine war is eventually ended, NATO will be on very high alert for a decade afterwards. Meanwhile, all diplomatic hands are on deck trying to prevent the Middle East from catching completely on fire as Israel, Iran, and their Arab neighbors engage in a very delicate dance of provocation and risk management. \n\nSo it's a golden opportunity for Beijing to go on a building spree. US industrial capacity is spooling up, yes, but much of the additional capacity is being consumed by Ukraine and Israel. And there are so many other conflicts going on that a naval build-up in the West Pacific is barely going to make any headlines when apartment buildings and hospitals are being leveled in Kyiv and Gaza. \n\nAnd every US carrier group sent to babysit the Mediterranean, Red Sea, or Persian Gulf is another carrier group that won't be available in the West Pacific theater. So a focused build-up now is an opportunity to establish in-theater superiority 5-10 years down the line. And given that it's highly unlikely that the US will choose to fully abandon Eastern Europe or Israel in the medium term, the recent flare-ups of violence mean that significant numbers of US naval assets are likely to remain \"spoken for\" for quite some time. \n\nIf the trend line continues, by 2030 you could be looking at the US still being stretched pretty thin: even if the current conflicts are wrapped up, the lingering tensions will require US attention and military presence. Meanwhile, PLAN can pretty much focus all of its assets (token anti-piracy forces notwithstanding) in the West Pacific theater -- a theater where it can also leverage land-based PLAAF and PLARF assets. \n\nSooner or later, it becomes obvious to everyone that the US can't be assured of victory in the theater, even with the help of its regional allies. When the penny drops on this, it dramatically shifts the calculus on finding a political settlement to territorial disputes. Ideally, this allows Beijing to settle the disputes in a favorable manner -- getting most of it wants with only some minor concessions -- without having to fight a war at all. \n\nNot saying this is how it will all play out, but that's my reading of the situation.",

And there are so many other conflicts going on that a naval build-up in the West Pacific is barely going to make any headlines when apartment buildings and hospitals are being leveled in Kyiv and Gaza. </p>\n\n<p>And every US carrier group sent to babysit the Mediterranean, Red Sea, or Persian Gulf is another carrier group that won&#39;t be available in the West Pacific theater. So a focused build-up now is an opportunity to establish in-theater superiority 5-10 years down the line. And given that it&#39;s highly unlikely that the US will choose to fully abandon Eastern Europe or Israel in the medium term, the recent flare-ups of violence mean that significant numbers of US naval assets are likely to remain &quot;spoken for&quot; for quite some time. </p>\n\n<p>If the trend line continues, by 2030 you could be looking at the US still being stretched pretty thin: even if the current conflicts are wrapped up, the lingering tensions will require US attention and military presence. Meanwhile, PLAN can pretty much focus all of its assets (token anti-piracy forces notwithstanding) in the West Pacific theater -- a theater where it can also leverage land-based PLAAF and PLARF assets. </p>\n\n<p>Sooner or later, it becomes obvious to everyone that the US can&#39;t be assured of victory in the theater, even with the help of its regional allies. When the penny drops on this, it dramatically shifts the calculus on finding a political settlement to territorial disputes. Ideally, this allows Beijing to settle the disputes in a favorable manner -- getting most of it wants with only some minor concessions -- without having to fight a war at all. </p>\n\n<p>Not saying this is how it will all play out, but that&#39;s my reading of the situation.</p>\n</div>",

Ukraine was already in the defend-against-Russia mindset.\n\nThese raids are not an existential threat to Russia, and Ukraine isn't seeking to permanently claim territory (other than reclamation of previously annexed territory, which this obviously isn't). There's no realistic outcome of this war where Ukraine gains sovereignty over Russia, in part because they just don't want to. So for Russian civilians this may be scary, but there's far less of an incentive to fight back. If they keep their heads down, eventually the problem will go away. The Ukrainians are just passing through in search of strategic targets, not coming to completely rearrange domestic life. It was the same with the Wagner stuff; that was a potentially big problem for the government, but people outside of the government and military would've been largely unaffected regardless of who won. It wasn't about deep issues that made any difference to ordinary civilians, so they might as well just stay out of the way and let the army men have their pissing contest.\n\nAnother factor is that the Ukrainian attacks are currently moving through fairly small towns where there aren't a great many people, and those are naturally going to be less inclined to start trouble.

        "body": "A few thoughts about the Kursk operation on a bit more meta level:\n\nApparently, Russia had very little in terms of troops in place to guard the front. And those that were in place were not the most capable fighters. One possible explanation is complacency - Ukraine has not attacked in the last 2 years in force, why should they do that now. The other is that Russia simply does not have enough forces for the Donbass offensive and the other fronts in Ukraine and to properly guard the Russian-Ukrainian border.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine obviously felt that they had forces that were not immediately necessary for other fronts, but were available for this operation. This may indicate that the balance of forces and with it, the initative, is shifting towards Ukraine, after Russia has held the upper hand in force generation for roughly a year after the culmation of the 2023 counteroffensive. Of course, there are a lot of unknown factors - Ukraine might be willing to sacrifice other parts of the front for a PR coup. We may see the war moving towards a more balanced phase if Ukraine has reserves to spare and Russia may feel the need to invest more into guarding the border.\n\nFurthermore, this is an evident failure of Russian intelligence. Ukraine was able to identify a part of the front with very limited Russian forces. Meanwhile, Russia did not detect the buildup of forces in Ukraine or failed to respond to it. Again, complacency is a reasonable explanation, but it could also point to a lack of intelligence assets - of whichever form - on the Russian side. If too many drones, planes, satellites etc. are necessary for Donbass, there may not be enought for other parts of the border. Again, this would force Russia to make choices that they probably would not like to make.\n\nIt may be too early, but my assumption is that the phase of relative Russian strength has passed. Ukraine is mobilising more, western aid seems to be sufficient for the time being, Russia can not expand their forces in a meaningful manner since they are bottlenecked by what equipment can be reactivated, and so on. This of course does not mean that an Ukrainian victory is imminent or certain - just that the period of slow but inexorable Russian advances may be over.",

They did not provide any intelligence on the status of the Abibal contract.  </p>\n\n<p>A third intelligence source from another European agency said it had also received information that Russia had sent soldiers to Iran to train in the use of Iranian ballistic missile systems, without providing further details.  </p>\n\n<p>A senior Iranian official, who requested anonymity, said Iran had sold missiles and drones to Russia but has not provided Fath-360 missiles. There was no legal prohibition on Tehran selling such weapons to Russia, the source added.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Slower per day, greater over all. </p>\n\n<p>Even in the drone footage shown you can see a lot of trucks making it through. Those guys now have spades and are digging in. It now how any sane wester officer would want to fight, but its Russia. They have their limitations in their tactical flexibility due to awful training and poor officers. But they have their advantage in they can absorb causalities to get people and dig stop lines. They can have those lines over run and they can regenerate those losses. </p>\n\n<p>Whether its a good or bad decision will only ever be known if someone gets to read accurate archives of the event, bit like Gantz managed to do with the Great Patriotic War in the 90s. </p>\n\n<p>Otherwise all opinions should be tempered wiht a large dose of remembering we know very little about the on the ground conditions and Russia will not have the same accounting of good and bas losses as us.</p>\n</div>",
