This all is escalating pretty fast and the US will probably respond after this.\n\nhttps://vxtwitter.com/CENTCOM/status/1731424734829773090\n\n> Today, there were four attacks against three separate commercial vessels operating in international waters in the southern Red Sea. These three vessels are connected to 14 separate nations. The Arleigh-Burke Class destroyer USS CARNEY responded to the distress calls from the ships and provided assistance.\n\n> At approximately 9:15 a.m. Sanaa time, the CARNEY detected an anti-ship ballistic missile attack fired from Houthi controlled areas of Yemen toward the M/V UNITY EXPLORER, impacting in the vicinity of the vessel. UNITY EXPLORER is a Bahamas flagged, U.K. owned and operated, bulk cargo ship crewed by sailors from two nations. The CARNEY was conducting a patrol in the Red Sea and detected the attack on the UNITY EXPLORER.\n\n> At approximately 12 p.m., and while in international waters, CARNEY engaged and shot down a UAV launched from Houthi controlled areas in Yemen. The drone was headed toward CARNEY although its specific target is not clear. We cannot assess at this time whether the Carney was a target of the UAVs. There was no damage to the U.S. vessel or injuries to personnel.\n\n> In a separate attack at approximately 12:35 p.m., UNITY EXPLORER reported they were struck by a missile fired from Houthi controlled areas in Yemen. CARNEY responded to the distress call. While assisting with the damage assessment, CARNEY detected another inbound UAV, destroying the drone with no damage or injuries on the CARNEY or UNITY EXPLORER. UNITY EXPLORER reports minor damage from the missile strike.\n\n> At approximately 3:30 p.m. the M/V NUMBER 9 was struck by a missile fired from Houthi controlled areas in Yemen while operating international shipping lanes in the Red Sea. The Panamanian flagged, Bermuda and U.K. owned and operated, bulk carrier reported damage and no casualties.\n\n> At approximately 4:30 p.m., the M/V SOPHIE II, sent a distress call stating they were struck by a missile. CARNEY again responded to the distress call and reported no significant damage. While en route to render support, CARNEY shot down a UAV headed in its direction. SOPHIE II is a Panamanian flagged bulk carrier, crewed by sailors from eight countries.\n\n> These attacks represent a direct threat to international commerce and maritime security. They have jeopardized the lives of international crews representing multiple countries around the world. We also have every reason to believe that these attacks, while launched by the Houthis in Yemen, are fully enabled by Iran. The United States will consider all appropriate responses in full coordination with its international allies and partners.",

        "body": "There's a new book in Poland with interviews with anonymous government officials about Polish-Ukrainian relations during the war. We had [a thread about it a few days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/17vt4p1/credibledefense_daily_megathread_november_15_2023/k9dnjak/), it links to a summary of the most interesting things, like leaving MiGs in the forest so Ukrainians could \"steal\" them.\n\nHere's an interview with the author, translated with DeepL with some manual corrections ([source in Polish](https://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/wiadomosci/7,114881,30450901,najpierw-pchalismy-migi-przez-zielona-granice-teraz-walczymy.html)).\n\n**At the beginning of your book, I feel those emotions I remember from the winter and spring of 2022. Then they blur, the grayness returns. The enthusiasm and brotherhood have ended. Disagreements and guilt-tripping began. We had a stereotypical Polish uprising?**\n\n[Translator's note: there's a stereotype that Polish uprisings always fail, it's a short moment of glory followed by years of sorrow]\n\nExactly according to this logic it all happened. The term \"uprising\" was used in this context by the head of the Polish Institute of International Affairs S\u0142awomir D\u0119bski, to whom one of the interviewees refers. He said that this was our next national uprising against Russia. The invasion of Ukraine was undoubtedly a historical event that caused great emotions and led to an unprecedented uprising. Also at the level of the highest authorities.\n\n**The beginning of the book is actually such a bit of a sensational story about guerrilla deliveries of weapons and phone calls from the bunker asking for fuel for the army. Some, with MiG-29 fighter jets parked in the woods near the border with a suggestion to the Ukrainians to take them away, are hard to believe.**\n\nWell, but that's what happened. To be precise, it was still early spring 2022, before Joe Biden flew to Poland for his first wartime visit, which took place on March 25. At that time, our people managed to convince the Americans to give the green light for the delivery of heavy weapons. Tanks, artillery and the like. Previously, Washington had shied away from this because of fears of inflaming the situation. However, they managed to convince them. We were the ones who pioneered this issue. We did it at the strenuous requests of the Ukrainians, that were directed to us in direct talks. And those fighter aircraft in the forest were before that. It was a few machines.\n\n**Well, but nevertheless after that it broke down. According to your interviews, it was because President Andrzej Duda and his entourage got bored with the topic and burned out, and the Ukrainians decided that we are now an unnecessary intermediary.**\n\nUndoubtedly, among my interlocutors there was a belief that the President lacked determination to build something deeper and lasting on the basis of those extraordinary first months of the war. There was a feeling that we had missed a unique opportunity. At the same time, let's not kid ourselves, Ukraine is a difficult partner. It took a lot of perseverance to achieve something. Zelensky, after the first phase of the war, when he solidified and stepped into the role of war president, did not make things easy. All the most important people wanted to talk to him. A Polish patron and intermediary became unnecessary.\n\n**It is sad and shocking that when a few people stop wanting to, two nations of tens of millions of people lose a unique opportunity to come together and establish serious cooperation.**\n\nMid-level officials and the state apparatus can't pull this off on their own. There's a need for leadership. Someone must point the way and outline the tasks. Without that, it won't work. Especially when dealing with such emotional nations as ours. We get offended at the Ukrainians for not being grateful to us. They get offended at us, for being frivolous and expecting some kind of special gratitude, because, after all, with their own lives, they are defending us from the hordes from the East, and it is in our interest to support them. It can be said that this stereotypical Polish messianism of ours, the C hrist of nations fighting for our freedom and yours, has now shifted to the east. This is now how the Ukrainians see themselves. Both sides have their narrative, and the two narratives do not meet.\n\n**You wrote in the book that there was an attempt to cement these positive emotions of our brotherhood with a treaty on mutual relations. Only before it could be written and agreed upon, boredom and disputes began, until finally Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski [translator's note: de facto leader of Poland] said to give up.**\n\nThat is, unfortunately, how it happened. The nail in the coffin was the grain scandal this summer, although it had already begun to break down earlier. From the fall of the Ukrainian missile in Przewod\u00f3w. I believe that relations between emotional nations like ours need to be shaped with contracts, rigid frameworks, systemically. So that it is stipulated that so many and so many times a year the government must meet with the government, and so many talks must be held by the presidents or institutions of both countries dealing with history. So that there is a systematic opportunity to exchange views, seek compromises and forge lasting cooperation. A bit like the relationship between France and Germany after World War II. There is no denying that they remain difficult and are based on rivalry, with a complicated history, but they have their 1963 Elys\u00e9e Treaty, which imposes the need for regular meetings of top politicians and officials. In our country, it has not been possible to use the historic opportunity to create something similar. Although there was an attempt.\n\n(part 1/2)",

The term &quot;uprising&quot; was used in this context by the head of the Polish Institute of International Affairs S\u0142awomir D\u0119bski, to whom one of the interviewees refers. He said that this was our next national uprising against Russia. The invasion of Ukraine was undoubtedly a historical event that caused great emotions and led to an unprecedented uprising. Also at the level of the highest authorities.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The beginning of the book is actually such a bit of a sensational story about guerrilla deliveries of weapons and phone calls from the bunker asking for fuel for the army. Some, with MiG-29 fighter jets parked in the woods near the border with a suggestion to the Ukrainians to take them away, are hard to believe.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Well, but that&#39;s what happened. To be precise, it was still early spring 2022, before Joe Biden flew to Poland for his first wartime visit, which took place on March 25. At that time, our people managed to convince the Americans to give the green light for the delivery of heavy weapons. Tanks, artillery and the like. Previously, Washington had shied away from this because of fears of inflaming the situation. However, they managed to convince them. We were the ones who pioneered this issue. We did it at the strenuous requests of the Ukrainians, that were directed to us in direct talks. And those fighter aircraft in the forest were before that. It was a few machines.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Well, but nevertheless after that it broke down. According to your interviews, it was because President Andrzej Duda and his entourage got bored with the topic and burned out, and the Ukrainians decided that we are now an unnecessary intermediary.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Undoubtedly, among my interlocutors there was a belief that the President lacked determination to build something deeper and lasting on the basis of those extraordinary first months of the war. There was a feeling that we had missed a unique opportunity. At the same time, let&#39;s not kid ourselves, Ukraine is a difficult partner. It took a lot of perseverance to achieve something. Zelensky, after the first phase of the war, when he solidified and stepped into the role of war president, did not make things easy. All the most important people wanted to talk to him. A Polish patron and intermediary became unnecessary.</p>\n\n<p><strong>It is sad and shocking that when a few people stop wanting to, two nations of tens of millions of people lose a unique opportunity to come together and establish serious cooperation.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Mid-level officials and the state apparatus can&#39;t pull this off on their own. There&#39;s a need for leadership. Someone must point the way and outline the tasks. Without that, it won&#39;t work. Especially when dealing with such emotional nations as ours. We get offended at the Ukrainians for not being grateful to us. They get offended at us, for being frivolous and expecting some kind of special gratitude, because, after all, with their own lives, they are defending us from the hordes from the East, and it is in our interest to support them. It can be said that this stereotypical Polish messianism of ours, the C hrist of nations fighting for our freedom and yours, has now shifted to the east. This is now how the Ukrainians see themselves. Both sides have their narrative, and the two narratives do not meet.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You wrote in the book that there was an attempt to cement these positive emotions of our brotherhood with a treaty on mutual relations. Only before it could be written and agreed upon, boredom and disputes began, until finally Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski [translator&#39;s note: de facto leader of Poland] said to give up.</strong></p>\n\n<p>That is, unfortunately, how it happened. The nail in the coffin was the grain scandal this summer, although it had already begun to break down earlier. From the fall of the Ukrainian missile in Przewod\u00f3w. I believe that relations between emotional nations like ours need to be shaped with contracts, rigid frameworks, systemically. So that it is stipulated that so many and so many times a year the government must meet with the government, and so many talks must be held by the presidents or institutions of both countries dealing with history. So that there is a systematic opportunity to exchange views, seek compromises and forge lasting cooperation. A bit like the relationship between France and Germany after World War II. There is no denying that they remain difficult and are based on rivalry, with a complicated history, but they have their 1963 Elys\u00e9e Treaty, which imposes the need for regular meetings of top politicians and officials. In our country, it has not been possible to use the historic opportunity to create something similar. Although there was an attempt.</p>\n\n<p>(part 1/2)</p>\n</div>",

In a conventional conflict, it would look to overwhelm the enemy quickly enough that the cost imbalance doesn't accumulate much. Even without airpower, the ability for the US to strike deep into enemy territory is significant between rocket and tube artillery. The US Army has 368 HIMARS, 226+ M270s, 514 M109, and 446 M777.

But that's a different discussion. \n\nFor irregular or insurgency conflicts, the number of drones that would need kinetic interception would likely be small enough that the cost will be easily covered in the budgets. Insurgents will use either cheaper, commercial drones which can be dealt with by EW, or larger, more EW resistant drones that cost more. Either way, it isn't the overwhelming numbers that are seen in the Ukraine conflict. \n\nJust eating the cost isn't a long term solution, as drones will get cheaper and more EW resistant.

Is there any plan for more tubes or mortar ammo to be sent to ukraine? Does Russia also suffer from a lack of mortars? Is this a problem that all militaries suffer from? </p>\n\n<p>Any information on that would be nice.</p>\n</div>",

Schemes and Systems reported that Redut is an amalgamation of at least 20 irregular Russian units and that recruitment requirements and training conditions vary widely between the various units. Schemes and Systems added that Redut personnel often do not know whom to contact about unpaid salaries and cannot request military service documentation because Russian law prohibits the operations of PMCs in Russia. Schemes and Systems concluded that Russian authorities are likely interested in cryptomobilization mechanisms like Redut to address Russia\u2019s force generation issues and to obscure the stresses that the war has placed on Russian society.\nRussian state-owned defense conglomerate Rostec announced on December 2 that Rostec subsidiary United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) transferred new Su-30SM2 fight aircraft and Yak-130 combat trainer aircraft to the Russian MoD.[80] UAC equipped the new Su-30 aircraft with improved avionics, increasing the aircraft's ability to detect and identify air targets. The Russian MoD will use the new Yak-130 aircraft to train Russian pilots with specialized flight simulators, integrated objective control systems, and educational computer classes.\n\n> - **Russian Technological Adaptations (Russian objective: Introduce technological innovations to optimize systems for use in Ukraine)**\nRussian milbloggers amplified footage on December 2 purporting to show the Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) testing modernized Ka-52M combat helicopters at the Progress Arsenyev Aviation Company in Arsenyev, Primorskiy Krai.[81] The milbloggers claimed that the modernized version of the Ka-52M is equipped with modernized turrets with a GOES-451M optical-electronic designation station, an updated BKS-50M onboard communication system, and an SUO-806PM weapons control system.[82] Russian milbloggers claimed that the modernized Ka-52M will be able to launch light multipurpose guided rockets (LMURs) at a range of up to 14.5km.[83] Russian forces relied on Ka-52 helicopters to help repel large-scale mechanized Ukrainian assaults at the start of the Ukrainian counteroffensive in western Zaporizhia Oblast in June 2023.[84]\n\n> - **Activities in Russian-occupied areas (Russian objective: Consolidate administrative control of annexed areas; forcibly integrate Ukrainian citizens into Russian sociocultural, economic, military, and governance systems)**\nUkrainian partisans reportedly conducted a partisan attack against Russian military personnel in occupied Melitopol, Zaporizhia Oblast, on December 1. The Ukrainian Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) reported that Ukrainian partisans conducted a successful attack that killed several Russian personnel, disabled military equipment, and damaged a Russian military refueling station in Melitopol.[85] The GUR reported that local occupation administration officials are trying to hide the consequences of the partisan attack out of fear of Russian special services.[86]\nRussian occupation officials continue to use military patriotic education programs to indoctrinate Ukrainian children and set conditions for their deportation to Russia. A Russian milblogger amplified footage on December 2 of Donetsk People\u2019s Republic (DNR) First Deputy Information Minister Daniil Bezsonov participating in the \u201cWe are Russia\u201d youth forum in Moscow Oblast and delivering a presentation on survival skills and tactical medicine to children, including those from occupied Ukraine.[87] The milblogger claimed that 500 children, some of whom arrived from occupied Ukraine, attended the forum in Moscow Oblast.[88] Moscow Oblast Governor Andrey Vorobyov reportedly organized the forum.[89]\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated in an interview with the Associated Press published on December 2 that Ukrainian and Russian forces conduct limited localized prisoner of war (POW) exchanges on the battlefield.[90] Ukrainian Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War Representative Petro Yatsenko stated on November 17 and 27 that Russian officials have frozen POW exchanges since the summer of 2023 and are not considering Ukrainian proposals for POW exchanges.[91]\n\n> - **Russian Information Operations and Narratives**\nRussian President Vladimir Putin appears increasingly committed to seizing control over even the most minute actors in the Russian information space, as evidenced by the Kremlin\u2019s appointment of the Bolshoi Theater\u2019s new general director. Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin signed a decree on December 1 appointing the artistic director of the Mariinsky Theater, Valery Gregiev, general director of the Bolshoi Theater for the next five years.[92] The Guardian reported that Gergiev has been close to Putin since the early 1990s, when former Russian President Boris Yeltsin appointed Gergiev to his position at the Mariinsky Theater, and that Gergiev has publicly supported Putin throughout his political career and Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.[93] The Guardian, citing Russian music specialist Simon Morrison, reported that Gergiev\u2019s dual roles at the Mariinsky and Bolshoi theaters are a return to Imperial Russia\u2019s \u201ddirector of the Imperial Theater,\u201d a single director who oversaw every Russian ballet, opera, and theater company during the 19th century and furthered the tsar\u2018s ideology.[94] Morrison told the Guardian that Gergiev will likely use the Bolshoi\u2019s productions and platform to further Putin\u2019s conceptions of nationalism, imperialism, and conservatism domestically and abroad.\nRussian media intentionally misrepresented comments that Ukrainian First Lady Olena Zelenska made in an interview with the Economist published on December 1, likely in an effort to portray Ukrainian war weariness. Zelenska stated in the interview that she does not want her husband, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, to seek another term following Ukraine\u2019s military victory over Russia.[95] Russian media omitted Zelenska\u2019s caveat about the Ukrainian victory to portray Zelenska as wishing for a more immediate end to Zelensky\u2019s tenure as Ukrainian President.[96]",

It&#39;s the same type of partisan bias you would get in reverse in the US if you presented a policy proposal as &quot;President Biden&#39;s&quot; to republicans or &quot;President Trump&#39;s&quot; to democrats.</p>\n\n<p>All this has <a href=\"https://globalaffairs.org/research/public-opinion-survey/majority-russians-still-unwilling-return-occupied-parts-ukraine\">already been tested by Levada</a>, the &quot;end the war / negotiate&quot; option had considerably more support (a supermajority) when phrased as &quot;President Putin&#39;s decision&quot;, but reversed to a supermajority in opposition when returning the newly annexed territories was expressly specified as a condition for a peace agreement, and over 80% for Crimea.</p>\n</div>",

When it comes to his evaluation of whether or not a peace offer in 2000 was good, I don't trust his judgment. Bill Clinton is also extremely pro-Israeli, which was one of the major problems with the negotiations: the \"neutral\" arbiter was clearly on the side of one of the parties.\n\nThe Palestinians were not offered a sovereign state. The Israelis demanded Palestinian demilitarization, IDF bases in the Jordan Valley (in the West Bank), and the right of the IDF to enter into Palestine. The Israelis demanded control over Palestinian borders and a veto over Palestinian foreign policy. They demanded very significant Palestinian territorial concessions, including the most important parts of East Jerusalem, settlements deep in the West Bank, and corridors to the Jordan valley, all of which would have cut the Palestinian state into Swiss cheese. On top on that, they didn't even offer any type of right of return.\n\nArarat was right to reject the offer. It was not an offer of an actual, sovereign state. It was a form of autonomy inside Israel. If Palestine is going to be subject to such far-reaching Israeli control, Palestinians should be able to vote for the Israeli Knesset.\n\nThe Palestinians kept negotiating after Camp David, but then Barak lost power in Israel and an extreme-right government came to power, and that was the end of that.",

When it comes to his evaluation of whether or not a peace offer in 2000 was good, I don&#39;t trust his judgment. Bill Clinton is also extremely pro-Israeli, which was one of the major problems with the negotiations: the &quot;neutral&quot; arbiter was clearly on the side of one of the parties.</p>\n\n<p>The Palestinians were not offered a sovereign state. The Israelis demanded Palestinian demilitarization, IDF bases in the Jordan Valley (in the West Bank), and the right of the IDF to enter into Palestine. The Israelis demanded control over Palestinian borders and a veto over Palestinian foreign policy. They demanded very significant Palestinian territorial concessions, including the most important parts of East Jerusalem, settlements deep in the West Bank, and corridors to the Jordan valley, all of which would have cut the Palestinian state into Swiss cheese. On top on that, they didn&#39;t even offer any type of right of return.</p>\n\n<p>Ararat was right to reject the offer. It was not an offer of an actual, sovereign state. It was a form of autonomy inside Israel. If Palestine is going to be subject to such far-reaching Israeli control, Palestinians should be able to vote for the Israeli Knesset.</p>\n\n<p>The Palestinians kept negotiating after Camp David, but then Barak lost power in Israel and an extreme-right government came to power, and that was the end of that.</p>\n</div>",

Russian losses are staggering. I've seen the videos, like that platoon the other day that got wiped out with a couple cluster shells. We can trace the losses of Russian armored vehicles to get a sense of their materiel losses too. Put simply, they've stopped using armor in excess of \"baseline\" just based on the number of destroyed vehicles counted, let alone the videos of infantry hoofing it multiple km from staging points. An army group that still has substantial equipment doesn't stop using equipment. You stop because you dont have the numbers to spare.\n\nThey're incurring manpower losses that make the Ukrainian Tokmak offensive look like a walk in the park. They do have a solid system of recruitment in place. But I don't think it's enough to make up for the losses in Avdiivka.

I&#39;ve seen the videos, like that platoon the other day that got wiped out with a couple cluster shells. We can trace the losses of Russian armored vehicles to get a sense of their materiel losses too. Put simply, they&#39;ve stopped using armor in excess of &quot;baseline&quot; just based on the number of destroyed vehicles counted, let alone the videos of infantry hoofing it multiple km from staging points.

Russian milbloggers claimed that Russian forces counterattacked in Krynky (30km northeast of Kherson Oblast and 2km from the Dnipro River) with air and artillery support and recaptured some unspecified positions, although ISW has observed no visual confirmation of this claim.[70] Russian milbloggers claimed that Ukrainian forces unsuccessfully attacked in and around Krynky and near Poyma (12km east of Kherson City and 4km from the Dnipro River) and Pishchanivka (13km east of Kherson City and 3km from the Dnipro River).[71] The milbloggers claimed that Ukrainian forces took advantage of poor weather conditions to rotate personnel and consolidate defensive positions.[72]\n\n-  [Nov 28](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-november-28-2023)\n\n> Ukrainian forces maintained positions and reportedly attacked in the east (left) bank of Kherson Oblast on November 28. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces continued to hold positions in the east bank of Kherson Oblast.[82] Russian milbloggers claimed that Ukrainian forces attacked near Poyma (10km southeast of Kherson City and 4km from the Dnipro River) and in a forest area near Krynky (30km northeast of Kherson City and 2km from the Dnipro River).[83]\n\n> Russian milbloggers claimed on November 28 that Russian forces continued efforts to dislodge Ukrainian forces from \u201cfirmly entrenched\u201d positions in the east bank of Kherson Oblast.[84] A prominent Russian milblogger claimed that fighting continues in Krynky and that Russian forces are concentrating significant manpower along the Poyma-Krynky line.[85] A Russian milblogger claimed that elements of the Russian 810th Guards Naval Infantry Brigade (Black Sea Fleet) and 61st Naval Infantry Brigade (Northern Fleet) are operating near Krynky.[86] Mashovets stated that elements of the newly-formed Russian 104th Guards Airborne (VDV) Division deployed directly north and northeast of the Crimean Perekop Isthmus, far from the fighting in Kherson Oblast.[87]\n\n-  [Nov 29](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-november-29-2023)\n\n> The apparent Russian failure to establish a cohesive command structure among forces defending on the east (left) bank of Kherson Oblast continues to degrade Russian morale and combat capabilities. The Ukrainian General Staff reported on November 29 that elements of the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade (Black Sea Fleet) operating near Krynky (30km northeast of Kherson City and 2km from the Dnipro River) are refusing to conduct assaults on Ukrainian positions due to a lack of artillery coordination, tactical intelligence transmission, and proper communication about the location of Russian minefields.[1] The Ukrainian General Staff reported that maps of the Russian minefields are classified and that Russian commanders have not properly coordinated with assault units about the locations of these minefields, leading to 50 casualties among elements of the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade in the last month.[2] Elements of the 810th Naval Infantry brigade arrived in the Krynky area in early October 2023 and appear to have taken over responsibility for the immediate Krynky area from elements of the newly created 18th Combined Arms Army (CAA) following the start of Ukrainian ground operations on the east bank of the Dnipro in mid-October 2023.[3] The Ukrainian General Staff reported that the 18th CAA\u2019s 28th Motorized Rifle Regiment is currently operating in Pishchanivka (14km east of Kherson City and 3km from the Dnipro River).[4] Additional elements of the 18th CAA and the 7th Airborne (VDV) Division reportedly hold positions in near rear areas on the east bank, and the joint command of these formations is likely overseeing much of the current Russian response to the Ukrainian ground operations on the east bank.[5] The reported minefield incident suggests that the command of the 18th CAA did not share relevant tactical details with the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade\u2019s command, suggesting that higher-level Russian commanders responsible for the defense of the east bank have yet to remedy this failure in coordination.\n\n> The Russian \u201cDnepr\u201d Grouping of Forces is increasingly comprised of disparate elements of recently transferred and degraded units and new formations, which may be contributing to this apparent lack of cohesive command structure. Elements of the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade and 177th Naval Infantry Brigade (Caspian Flotilla) transferred to the Kherson direction likely after sustaining heavy casualties defending against the Ukrainian counteroffensive in western Zaporizhia Oblast in the summer of 2023.[6] The majority of the 7th VDV Division\u2019s combat elements are currently still defending in western Zaporizhia Oblast, although the 7th VDV\u2019s 171st Air Assault Battalion (97th VDV Regiment) and 104th Separate Tank Battalion are reportedly operating on the east bank of Kherson Oblast.[7] Elements of the 49th CAA (Southern Military District) have reportedly been operating in the Kherson direction since the Ukrainian liberation of Kherson City in November 2022, but some Russian and Ukrainian sources claim that the Russian command has since redeployed elements of at least one of its brigades to the Donetsk-Zaporizhia Oblast border area.[8] The newly created 18th CAA\u2019s 70th Motorized Rifle Division and 22nd Army Corps (formerly of the Black Sea Fleet) are operating on the east bank.[9] Elements of the newly created 104th VDV Division\u2019s 328th VDV Regiment are reportedly defending in the Krynky area, and Ukrainian military observer Kostyantyn Mashovets stated that additional elements of the 104th VDV Division are currently deploying to the Kherson direction.[10] ISW previously observed elements of the 80th Motorized Rifle Brigade (14th Army Corps, Northern Fleet) operating on the left bank in July 2023, and November 28 reports of 14th Army Corps Deputy Commander Major General Vladimir Zavadsky\u2019s death in the Kherson direction suggests that these elements may still be in the area.[11] Elements of the 41st CAA (Central Military District) reportedly transferred from the Kupyansk direction to Kherson Oblast in early October and may be defending on the east bank.[12]\n\n> Ukrainian forces continued ground attacks in the east (left) bank of Kherson Oblast on November 29 and reportedly advanced. Russian sources claimed that Ukrainian forces advanced southwest of Krynky (30km northeast of Kherson City and 2km from the Dnipro River) and established a foothold in a nearby forest area.[78] Russian milbloggers claimed that battles are ongoing near Krynky and that Russian aviation and artillery units are heavily striking the area.[79] The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces maintain positions on the east bank of the Dnipro River.[80] Russian milbloggers claimed that Ukrainian forces continue to transfer new assault groups to the left bank and that 300 to 400 Ukrainian personnel are operating near Krynky.[81] Continued Russian claims about the arrival of Ukrainian reinforcements on the east bank of the Dnipro River suggest that Russian forces are struggling to interdict Ukrainian efforts to supply and reinforce their positions in east bank Kherson Oblast.[82]\n\n-  [Nov 30](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-november-30-2023)\n\n> Ukrainian forces continued ground attacks on the left (east) bank of Kherson Oblast on November 30 but did not make confirmed or claimed advances. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces maintain positions on the east bank of the Dnipro River.[80] Several Russian sources claimed that fighting is ongoing near Krynky  (30km northeast of Kherson City and 2km from the Dnipro River) and that Russian aviation and artillery continue to heavily strike the area.[81] A prominent Kremlin-affiliated milblogger claimed that Ukrainian forces are unsuccessfully attempting to advance south of Krynky.[82]\n\n> The United Kingdom Ministry of Defense (UK MoD) reported on November 30 that elements of the newly formed Russian 104th Guards Airborne (VDV) Division have likely deployed to Kherson Oblast, consistent with ISW\u2019s previous observations.[83] The UK MoD reported that the Russian 337th VDV Regiment and Russian 52nd VDV Artillery Brigade will likely be subordinate to the 104th Guards VDV Division.[84] ISW recently observed reports that elements of the 328th VDV Regiment (104th Guards VDV Division) are currently defending in the Krynky area.[85]",

The Ukrainian General Staff reported on November 29 that elements of the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade (Black Sea Fleet) operating near Krynky (30km northeast of Kherson City and 2km from the Dnipro River) are refusing to conduct assaults on Ukrainian positions due to a lack of artillery coordination, tactical intelligence transmission, and proper communication about the location of Russian minefields.[1] The Ukrainian General Staff reported that maps of the Russian minefields are classified and that Russian commanders have not properly coordinated with assault units about the locations of these minefields, leading to 50 casualties among elements of the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade in the last month.[2] Elements of the 810th Naval Infantry brigade arrived in the Krynky area in early October 2023 and appear to have taken over responsibility for the immediate Krynky area from elements of the newly created 18th Combined Arms Army (CAA) following the start of Ukrainian ground operations on the east bank of the Dnipro in mid-October 2023.[3] The Ukrainian General Staff reported that the 18th CAA\u2019s 28th Motorized Rifle Regiment is currently operating in Pishchanivka (14km east of Kherson City and 3km from the Dnipro River).[4] Additional elements of the 18th CAA and the 7th Airborne (VDV) Division reportedly hold positions in near rear areas on the east bank, and the joint command of these formations is likely overseeing much of the current Russian response to the Ukrainian ground operations on the east bank.[5] The reported minefield incident suggests that the command of the 18th CAA did not share relevant tactical details with the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade\u2019s command, suggesting that higher-level Russian commanders responsible for the defense of the east bank have yet to remedy this failure in coordination.</p>\n\n<p>The Russian \u201cDnepr\u201d Grouping of Forces is increasingly comprised of disparate elements of recently transferred and degraded units and new formations, which may be contributing to this apparent lack of cohesive command structure. Elements of the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade and 177th Naval Infantry Brigade (Caspian Flotilla) transferred to the Kherson direction likely after sustaining heavy casualties defending against the Ukrainian counteroffensive in western Zaporizhia Oblast in the summer of 2023.[6] The majority of the 7th VDV Division\u2019s combat elements are currently still defending in western Zaporizhia Oblast, although the 7th VDV\u2019s 171st Air Assault Battalion (97th VDV Regiment) and 104th Separate Tank Battalion are reportedly operating on the east bank of Kherson Oblast.[7] Elements of the 49th CAA (Southern Military District) have reportedly been operating in the Kherson direction since the Ukrainian liberation of Kherson City in November 2022, but some Russian and Ukrainian sources claim that the Russian command has since redeployed elements of at least one of its brigades to the Donetsk-Zaporizhia Oblast border area.[8] The newly created 18th CAA\u2019s 70th Motorized Rifle Division and 22nd Army Corps (formerly of the Black Sea Fleet) are operating on the east bank.[9] Elements of the newly created 104th VDV Division\u2019s 328th VDV Regiment are reportedly defending in the Krynky area, and Ukrainian military observer Kostyantyn Mashovets stated that additional elements of the 104th VDV Division are currently deploying to the Kherson direction.[10] ISW previously observed elements of the 80th Motorized Rifle Brigade (14th Army Corps, Northern Fleet) operating on the left bank in July 2023, and November 28 reports of 14th Army Corps Deputy Commander Major General Vladimir Zavadsky\u2019s death in the Kherson direction suggests that these elements may still be in the area.[11] Elements of the 41st CAA (Central Military District) reportedly transferred from the Kupyansk direction to Kherson Oblast in early October and may be defending on the east bank.[12]</p>\n\n<p>Ukrainian forces continued ground attacks in the east (left) bank of Kherson Oblast on November 29 and reportedly advanced. Russian sources claimed that Ukrainian forces advanced southwest of Krynky (30km northeast of Kherson City and 2km from the Dnipro River) and established a foothold in a nearby forest area.[78] Russian milbloggers claimed that battles are ongoing near Krynky and that Russian aviation and artillery units are heavily striking the area.[79] The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces maintain positions on the east bank of the Dnipro River.[80] Russian milbloggers claimed that Ukrainian forces continue to transfer new assault groups to the left bank and that 300 to 400 Ukrainian personnel are operating near Krynky.[81] Continued Russian claims about the arrival of Ukrainian reinforcements on the east bank of the Dnipro River suggest that Russian forces are struggling to interdict Ukrainian efforts to supply and reinforce their positions in east bank Kherson Oblast.[82]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li> <a href=\"https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-november-30-2023\">Nov 30</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ukrainian forces continued ground attacks on the left (east) bank of Kherson Oblast on November 30 but did not make confirmed or claimed advances.

Israeli withdrawal is a signal in the wrong direction? If that's the calculus then you make a case that current Israeli leadership is right, there is no rational actor on the Palestinian side, and concessions only lead to massacres. The PLO was in control over both WB and Gaza and had similar precense in both. A withdrawal from the WB would send the same message as a withdrawal from Gaza.
