Armenia has a defense pact with Russia to protect it against attack, though relations with the Kremlin are strained after the government in Yerevan accused Moscow of failing to support it in last week\u2019s fighting.\n\n>Iran has also rejected the idea, which would risk cutting the Islamic Republic off from vital trade routes to Russia, and has staged military drills near its border with Azerbaijan amid deteriorating relations with Aliyev.\n\n>Erdogan and Aliyev will discuss Nagorno-Karabakh, open a modernized military installation in Naxcivan and attend a ground-breaking ceremony for a natural-gas pipeline to the exclave from the Turkish border province of Igdir, according to the Turkish president\u2019s office. The pipeline is expected to help diversify Naxcivan\u2019s gas imports away from Iran. \n\n>Turkey regards the corridor to Azerbaijan as key to its aspirations to become a trade route linking London and Beijing with railroads and highways. At the same time, Erdogan and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan are in talks on estalishing formal diplomatic relations and opening their border, which Turkey closed in 1993 in support of Azerbaijan over the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute.\n\n\n\n>Relations between Baku and Tehran deteriorated after the 2020 war between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Armed with Israeli and Turkish drones, Azerbaijan\u2019s forces reclaimed control of large swaths of its territory occupied by Armenia since the early 1990s before Russia brokered the cease-fire. \n\nThis comes on the heels of Armenia\u2019s stated dissatisfaction with CSTO:\n\n\n>[Armenia Slams Regional Security Blocs as Russia Rift Deepens](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-24/armenia-slams-regional-security-blocs-as-russia-rift-deepens)\n\n\n>Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said in a televised address to the nation that his country is no longer being protected by its regional allies and security blocs in its decades-long conflict with neighboring Azerbaijan.\n\n>\u201cThe analysis of the situation shows that the security blocks and allies, on whom we have long relied, have set a goal to show our vulnerability and make it impossible for the people of Armenia to have an independent state,\u201d Pashinyan added without directly naming Russia, Yerevan\u2019s biggest ally in the region.\n\n>The remarks come days after Russia decided not to intervene when Azerbaijan began a short military operation to take control of the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region. About 2,000 Russian troops have been based in the territory, which is largely populated by Armenians but which is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan, since a war in 2020.\n\n>Russia has historically supported Armenia in its repeated clashes with Azerbaijan over the territory, but President Vladimir Putin\u2019s preoccupation with the war on Ukraine has left Armenia feeling vulnerable. Armenia has a defense pact with Russia, though it doesn\u2019t cover Nagorno-Karabakh and both countries are members of the Russian-dominated Collective Security Treaty Organization. \n\n>Armenia skipped planned CSTO drills in Belarus earlier this month after expressing anger at Moscow\u2019s lack of support in the conflict with Azerbaijan. Days later, the Defense Ministry in Yerevan infuriated Russia by announcing joint military exercises with US forces to increase Armenian readiness for cooperation with NATO.\n\n>In a call with Pashinyan on Saturday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken reaffirmed US support for Armenia sovereignty and independence.",

I can also see how a certain level of envy/resentment towards the west could be brought about by the land itself. Like no matter how bad things get in Italy, for example, at least you can sip wine on the warm Mediterranean. Can\u2019t say the same thing in Russia.</p>\n</div>",

It's not as great as losing them as combat losses, but it will definitely degrade their performance in a major way. \n\nThe only other option is to disperse them to a degree that individual flights are never co-located with the rest of the squadron. That loses maintenance, rearming, and refueling capabilities, which hurts their ability to put birds in the air, which again degrades their performance in a major way. \n\nI was actually surprised the Russians weren't doing that already white accepting the lost effectiveness but it seems they gambled that a UAF wouldn't use their cruise missiles or long range drones against the airfields.

It&#39;s not as great as losing them as combat losses, but it will definitely degrade their performance in a major way. </p>\n\n<p>The only other option is to disperse them to a degree that individual flights are never co-located with the rest of the squadron. That loses maintenance, rearming, and refueling capabilities, which hurts their ability to put birds in the air, which again degrades their performance in a major way. </p>\n\n<p>I was actually surprised the Russians weren&#39;t doing that already white accepting the lost effectiveness but it seems they gambled that a UAF wouldn&#39;t use their cruise missiles or long range drones against the airfields. Now that&#39;s a really bad gamble. If they don&#39;t adopt, they&#39;re screwed. They need to move those bases ASAP, or disperse. Both of which help increase the success of UAF armor attacks.</p>\n</div>",

For Israel, it would open the door to more business with the Middle East\u2019s largest economy and help counter Iranian aggression. It could also encourage other Muslim-majority states to have friendlier ties with Israel, given the kingdom\u2019s status as the guardian of Islam\u2019s two holiest sites at Mecca and Medina.\n\n>In addition, the agreements could ease tensions in the region and help secure its vital oil- and gas-shipping lanes.\n\n>Biden discussed the issue with Benjamin Netanyahu in New York on Wednesday. The Israeli prime minister said he\u2019s confident of forging \u201ca historic peace\u201d between his country and Saudi Arabia. In an interview aired hours later, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told Fox News that \u201cevery day we get closer\u201d to a deal.\n\n> US and Israeli officials have discussed treating the two defense deals as effectively part of the same package to increase the chances of Congress agreeing to them, said several of the people. While many Senators are wary of any deal that obliges the US to defend Saudi Arabia, they would be more reluctant to reject a wider pact if such an action hurt Israel, said the people.\n\n> It will be crucial to sell a Saudi deal \u201cas a long-term basis for stability in the Middle East and as a benefit for a key US ally \u2014 Israel \u2014 that has huge influence on Capitol Hill,\u201d said analysts at Eurasia Group including Ayham Kamel and Sofia Meranto.\n\n> The US is determined to foster greater cooperation among its allies in the Middle East, not least to counter the growing influence of China. Revamping its military and security architecture in the region is now seen as crucial, said the people. Last week, it upgraded its defense relationship with Bahrain, albeit not to the extent that it needed to ask Congress for approval. The Saudis have told the US they want a deal that goes further than the one with Bahrain, said the people.\n\n>\u201cA treaty obligating America to assist Saudi Arabia in case of an attack benefits the whole GCC,\u201d said Ali Shihabi, a Saudi commentator with knowledge of the talks between Washington and Riyadh. He was referring to the Gulf Cooperation Council, a six-member grouping of major energy exporters including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar.\n\n>> Saudi Proposals\n\n>Saudi Arabia has asked for firm defense guarantees from the US, access to top-notch American weaponry and for assistance in building a nuclear-energy sector as conditions for normalizing ties with Israel. It also wants Israel to make concessions to the Palestinians, but has sent mixed signals as to what it may ultimately accept.\n\n> The kingdom\u2019s foreign minister, Faisal bin Farhan, told Saudi state media this week that his country would do everything to put the two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict back on the table.\n\n>\u201cFor us, the Palestinian issue is very important, we need to solve that part,\u201d Prince Mohammed told Fox, before adding that \u201cgood negotiations\u201d are continuing.\n\n>The US is asking Saudi Arabia to curb ties with China in sensitive high-technology areas in return for stronger security ties. Washington may also ask the Saudis to release some political prisoners and reform laws on free speech and criminal justice, according to Robert Satloff, executive director of the Washington Institute think tank, who is in contact with Israeli, Saudi and US negotiators.\n\n> Washington and Riyadh have reached a broad agreement on the nuclear and security aspects, though many details still need to be worked out, said the people. Saudi Arabia wants not just to build nuclear power plants, but to enrich uranium locally and eventually export nuclear fuel, which the US and Israel remain wary about.\n\n>Saudi Arabia has said its nuclear program is purely for peaceful purposes. But Prince Mohammed, the country\u2019s de facto ruler, reiterated to Fox that if regional rival Iran builds a nuclear bomb, the Saudis will follow suit.\n\n> Any nuclear agreement with Saudi Arabia will meet the US\u2019s stringent non-proliferation standards, according to one American official.\n\n>>Palestinian Obstacle\n\n>The Palestinian issue remains an obstacle given the right-wing bent of Netanyahu\u2019s governing coalition, said Dennis Ross, a former White House Middle East envoy. The current government is the most religious in the country\u2019s history, with many ministers opposed to any concessions to the Palestinians such as a freeze on more Jewish settlements in the West Bank.\n\n> \u201cUp until now, the focus has been entirely on the bilateral: what they want from us, which the administration seems quite willing to find a way to provide, and what we\u2019re asking from them in return for that, which the Saudis also seem open to responding to,\u201d Ross said in an interview last week. Securing anything significant from the Israeli government for the Palestinians \u201cwill be very hard.\u201d\n\n>While Israel is one of America\u2019s closest allies globally, the two don\u2019t have a formal defense treaty. Many in Israel have long opposed one, believing it could restrict their ability to strike other states or groups unilaterally. Any pact would need to leave Israel with freedom of action, said one of the people.\n \n> A US-Saudi defense pact would \u201cfundamentally alter\u201d Washington\u2019s posture in the Middle East and as such it would be \u201cstrategically short-sighted not to seriously explore the merits of doing the same with Israel,\u201d said John Hannah, senior fellow at the The Jewish Institute for National Security of America, a Washington think tank with close ties to officials in both Israel and the US.\n\n>Though talks involving the three countries are moving forward, US officials have urged caution.\n\n>\u201cThere may well be specific things that will be important for us, with regard both to Saudi Arabia and Israel, as well as things they will need from each other, as well as things that other parties may well need,\u201d US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last week. \u201cWe\u2019re not there.

He was campaign director of 'Vote Leave' during the run up to the Brexit vote. Then in 2019, it seems a whistle-blower within Government raised serious concerns about Cummings's connections to Russia. This was followed up by an MP within the Labour Party emailing the then Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab questioning the level of security vetting Cummings was subjected to prior to his appointment at No. 10.

        "body": "[Western officials press Ukraine to hold elections despite war](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/09/24/ukraine-elections-war-russia-west/)  \n\n> KYIV \u2014 Despite Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and a nationwide state of martial law, some Western politicians are pushing the government in Kyiv to hold parliamentary and presidential elections \u2014 a prospect that has left many Ukrainian officials scratching their heads.  \n> \n> The proposal \u2014 initially floated by Tiny Cox, the Dutch head of the Council of Europe\u2019s Parliamentary Assembly \u2014 was also pressed by Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), during a visit to Kyiv last month with Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), which otherwise focused on solidifying U.S. assistance and bipartisan support for Ukraine.\n> \n> Other Republicans have also taken up the cause, including conservative commentators like Tucker Carlson, who falsely accused Zelensky of canceling elections. Ukraine\u2019s constitution prohibits elections under martial law.\n> \n> Holding free and fair elections in wartime is virtually impossible and also ill-advised, according to Ukrainian officials, election experts and democracy advocates. Roughly one-fifth of Ukraine\u2019s territory is now occupied by Russian forces. Millions of Ukrainians are displaced and many are living outside the country. Tens of thousands of soldiers are deployed to the front.\n> \n> The pressure to hold elections, despite such obstacles, highlights the constant demand by some in the West that Ukraine prove its commitment to democracy, even though Ukrainians have twice risen up in mass pro-democracy demonstrations \u2014 the Orange Revolution of 2003-4 and the Maidan Revolution of 2013-14.\n> \n> Ukrainian officials say that in order to hold a major vote during wartime, considerable financial, logistical and legal hurdles must be overcome.

Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), during a visit to Kyiv last month with Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), which otherwise focused on solidifying U.S. assistance and bipartisan support for Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>Other Republicans have also taken up the cause, including conservative commentators like Tucker Carlson, who falsely accused Zelensky of canceling elections. Ukraine\u2019s constitution prohibits elections under martial law.</p>\n\n<p>Holding free and fair elections in wartime is virtually impossible and also ill-advised, according to Ukrainian officials, election experts and democracy advocates. Roughly one-fifth of Ukraine\u2019s territory is now occupied by Russian forces. Millions of Ukrainians are displaced and many are living outside the country. Tens of thousands of soldiers are deployed to the front.</p>\n\n<p>The pressure to hold elections, despite such obstacles, highlights the constant demand by some in the West that Ukraine prove its commitment to democracy, even though Ukrainians have twice risen up in mass pro-democracy demonstrations \u2014 the Orange Revolution of 2003-4 and the Maidan Revolution of 2013-14.</p>\n\n<p>Ukrainian officials say that in order to hold a major vote during wartime, considerable financial, logistical and legal hurdles must be overcome. In private, some say that the prospect is outright impossible, and could provide Moscow security forces with a means to infiltrate and weaken Ukraine from within.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe Russians are pushing for this through their secret channels,\u201d a Ukrainian official in the security apparatus said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject. \u201cThere is no situation in which it is possible to have a democratic election during the war.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The official said holding an election could give Russia an opportunity to manipulate and create divisions in Ukrainian society and among politicians, which for most of the war have disappeared to show solidarity while the country fights for its existence.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s risky, bad for the country and senseless from a political point of view,\u201d the official said adding: \u201cIt would undermine the very fragile political resilience of the Ukrainian state.\u201d  </p>\n\n<p>But Kyiv officials also cannot dismiss the idea of holding elections out of hand and risk alienating key political players in the West, who are demanding elections and are crucial for Ukraine to maintain international financial and military assistance.</p>\n\n<p>Former Ukrainian prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko said that holding elections during wartime would lead to Ukraine losing the war, as internal political disagreements \u2014 differences that occur naturally in a democratic society \u2014 shatter the national unity needed to defeat Russia.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe price of holding elections in wartime will be a lost war,\u201d Tymoshenko said in an interview in Brussels this month. \u201cUnity is an indispensable resource for our victory.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Tymoshenko also noted that soldiers fighting would have difficulty voting and are barred by law from seeking office in wartime. \u201cThose who are sacrificing their lives on the front line, most of them will not be able to vote,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cSeven million Ukrainian people are now refugees, many living outside the country \u2014 most of them will not be able to vote.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In May, Cox, a Dutch politician, gave an interview to Ukrainian media in which he called on Kyiv to hold elections that were \u201cas free and fair as possible.\u201d He gave the example of Turkey holding elections directly after experiencing a major earthquake as proof that holding a vote was possible.</p>\n\n<p>Cox later amended his comments, acknowledging that elections could not be held while Ukraine was under martial law, which is unlikely to be lifted before the war ends.

The president doesn't just decree martial law. The Parliament has to approve it, and it has, and elections are suspended while martial law is in force by law, not through an ad-hoc decision. This is not an extra-democratic process that eludes the consent of the governed, it's a democratic process performed by the legitimate representatives of the governed. *Holding* elections while martial law is in force would require legal changes of questionable legitimacy, given that, as far as we know so far, it's external pressure, rather than internal popular demand, that's causing this debate.\n\nArguments from political theory and democratic principles notwithstanding, there are several major *practical* problems that make these elections not unfeasible per se, but unfair and dangerous:\n\n1. It's impossible to guarantee the right to vote and to be elected for public positions while under general mobilisation. There are various special mechanisms in place to guarantee that e.g. emergency workers can vote even when they're on duty, but these are impossible to implement during wartime. It's one thing to ensure firement and policemen get to vote during their shifts, it's a whole other thing to ensure people in the first line get to vote. Mobilised personnel can't campaign and can't stand for office. Displaced people can't vote equally easy, which will undermine the legitimacy of the most affected regions.\n2. Russia's track record with civilian targets is atrocious. The last thing anyone wants is large numbers of civilians gathering in a single place. It's far too dangerous a thing to ask for in exchange for nothing but a symbolic victory.\n3. In addition to being dangerous for Ukrainian civilians in general, this will also be dangerous and difficult for Ukrainian and international observers. Elections will inevitably be under-observed -- there is a smaller volunteer base in Ukraine in the first place, and there are significant security risks for foreign travellers as well.\n\n*Of course* Russian communication strategists want to push for this. If elections don't happen, then nobody can blame them for not holding elections in 2024, either -- after all, Ukraine, the beacon of Western democracy, didn't hold elections, either. If they do happen, in addition to juicy civilian targets, they can also score an easy PR win. It won't be possible to elect new representatives in occupied regions, so they will be able to claim that the previous representatives are illegitimate and hold no authority, and that the people in the occupied regions *are* represented -- by their \"elected\" representatives, in the Duma in Moscow.

                "body": "And the longer the war continues, the greater would be the toll the radicalization of the parts of Ukrainian public would continue. Historically, frontlines were festering grounds for nationalist and fascistic attitudes, even in nations with far more robust in-house training pipelines such as the US - the book \"Bringing the War Home\", describes well the waves of intensified radical activity and racist violence which followed the return of larger populations of veterans who served in combat roles overseas. I guess (I'm by no means a subject matter expert, there are plenty better informed commentors on this sub) a reasonable assumption would be to expect continued pause in the further public historical debate over the subject until the termination of the conflict (motivated partially by not only by desire to preserve more collaborationist-friendly narratives in public imaginary of ww2, but also by dual concerns of legitimate liberal actors who'd wish for a more honest appraisal of the criminal side of their activity, concerns over: the impact of criticism on the state of the body public in the time of crisis and over national unity, but also concern over the continued ability of theirs to fight for a better historical policy in the years after the war - if the liberals are marginalized or pushed out from historical institutions after they jump the gun over the issues such 14th SS legacy, they might diminish their ability to eg. influence curricula in the future. On all these dynamics there are also enmeshed all the other truly foreign influences - of Russia, of course, but also of Poland's cultural sphere, the EU Institutions and the Transnational NGO-World from the region and beyond.\n\nThe Task that we have to take seriously, would be to create a deeper map of what the key actors here are, who are their potential replacements, what are their true sympathies, what power do some of the institutions really have and how is the power structured within these institutions.\n\nThen, and only then we can start building coalitions with like-minded partners on the ground, implement programme's that'd support careers and institutions doing the best they can and exposing and shaming bad actors in a way which actually do work.\n\nAll of these has do be done by Ukrainians themselves. They are to be the ones running the show, and the west should at most provide nudges and pushes as described above within their instructional structure. But crucially, we cannot take the word of current Ukrainian officials, at any level, at their word.

                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>And the longer the war continues, the greater would be the toll the radicalization of the parts of Ukrainian public would continue. Historically, frontlines were festering grounds for nationalist and fascistic attitudes, even in nations with far more robust in-house training pipelines such as the US - the book &quot;Bringing the War Home&quot;, describes well the waves of intensified radical activity and racist violence which followed the return of larger populations of veterans who served in combat roles overseas. I guess (I&#39;m by no means a subject matter expert, there are plenty better informed commentors on this sub) a reasonable assumption would be to expect continued pause in the further public historical debate over the subject until the termination of the conflict (motivated partially by not only by desire to preserve more collaborationist-friendly narratives in public imaginary of ww2, but also by dual concerns of legitimate liberal actors who&#39;d wish for a more honest appraisal of the criminal side of their activity, concerns over: the impact of criticism on the state of the body public in the time of crisis and over national unity, but also concern over the continued ability of theirs to fight for a better historical policy in the years after the war - if the liberals are marginalized or pushed out from historical institutions after they jump the gun over the issues such 14th SS legacy, they might diminish their ability to eg. influence curricula in the future. On all these dynamics there are also enmeshed all the other truly foreign influences - of Russia, of course, but also of Poland&#39;s cultural sphere, the EU Institutions and the Transnational NGO-World from the region and beyond.</p>\n\n<p>The Task that we have to take seriously, would be to create a deeper map of what the key actors here are, who are their potential replacements, what are their true sympathies, what power do some of the institutions really have and how is the power structured within these institutions.</p>\n\n<p>Then, and only then we can start building coalitions with like-minded partners on the ground, implement programme&#39;s that&#39;d support careers and institutions doing the best they can and exposing and shaming bad actors in a way which actually do work.</p>\n\n<p>All of these has do be done by Ukrainians themselves. They are to be the ones running the show, and the west should at most provide nudges and pushes as described above within their instructional structure. But crucially, we cannot take the word of current Ukrainian officials, at any level, at their word. We need to have independent trustworthy sources of intelligence who&#39;d not hesitate to speak unpleasant truth - even if only under Chatham house rules.</p>\n\n<p>Successful influence campaign aimed at the other country history policy is therefore a long and uncertain process.

I think historical context is needed to appreciate just how incorrect and insulting this line of reasoning is. Ukraine suffered 1.6 million KIA in addition to 3.7 million civilian dead during WWII, representing 16.3% of its then population of 41.3 million. To my knowledge, only Belarus and Poland failed worse at 25% and ~17% respectively. Russia lost 12.7% of its pre-war population, though out of a much larger population of 110 million. Point is, the insinuation that somehow Ukraine has any association with Nazi Germany is beyond insulting and betrays the grievous history of what happened in WWII. Yet the same who question Ukraine over isolated figures like Bandera don\u2019t grapple with Russia\u2019s history in WWII, from the gulags to the Volgadeutsche. \n\nWhen it comes to not \u201csufficiently grappling with the past\u201d Turkey\u2019s refusal to acknowledge the Armenian genocide has to be close to the top of the list. Worse still, the forced population movements of Armenians within their ally Azerbaijan following recent military action shows that hostile intent towards Armenians is not confined to history. Yet I don\u2019t see anyone arguing that Turkey or Azerbaijan aren\u2019t real countries. Why would Ukraine, the victim of genocidal intent by their invaders, be held to a different standard?",

Though I&#39;m pretty sure that if tomorrow Zelensky signs a peace treaty accepting a border just one inch short of the 1991 border but before even his Presidental Guard Brigade is committed to the last stand, the Khmelnytskyi brigade would happily continuing its namesake&#39;s tradition of killing Jews.</p>\n</div>",

Blackburn is a long-time pol, serving in the House pre-Trump. She's a conservative, but establishment-friendly Republican who acts the way she does because her state is blood-red. So sure, maaaaybe you could change her tune.\n\nRand is, for better or worse, a true believer in non-interventionism.
