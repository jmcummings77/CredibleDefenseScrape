It totally discounts the possibility that China could allocate a much larger share of national spending and mobilising society as a whole towards building military capability, which seems abundantly likely if it perceived that its relative power was waning. In fact with reversing economic fortunes undermining its legitimacy, the party may pivot to militarism and revanchism as a substitute. The idea of China as one that derives legitimacy from economic growth, and that the party's hold on power as consequently dependent on them continuing to deliver this growth to its populace, can only have been valid for the last few decades at most, if it was ever a valid conception to begin with.

A farm field gets captured, and people proclaim it a great strategic victory!!! \n\nReally the term should be used, at least in these conversations, with more precision. The US Army defines strategy as \"the proper correlation between means, ends, and national objective.\" Which is derived from Clausewitz's definition of war as \"an act of force which compels the enemy to do your will.\" Strategy ties together three things, the force you have, the effect it can produce, and the world you want to live in. How can the troops you have produce a change in world which brings you meaningfully closer to how you want it to look? Or in a more Clausewitzian sense, is the punch youre throwing going to convince me to give up and do what you want me to do? \n\nOn that level, the fighting around Bakhmut does not seem to bring Russia meaningfully closer to the kind of world they want. It does not destabilize the government in Kyiv, it does not capture a city of value for Russia, nor does it bring about a swifter end to the war along current lines. It does not seem to have attrited Ukrainian fighting strength sufficiently to bring about an end to the war. By all appearances the rump of Bakhmut, or the ruins of Soledar, will have no tangible impact on the Russian war effort. And so it seems obvious that the fighting there has not produced strategic value for the Russians. It has not been a strategic defeat. \n\nWe can examine things on the operational level, one step down from strategy, as well. Operational warfare is a bit more ephemeral, less defined, then the strategic level. But generally, operational warfare is the level in which multiple battles are tied together to produce a broader victory which brings the field forces one step closer to achieving the strategic conditions outlined by the Political-Military leaders who set it. Has Soledar or Bakhmut produced an operational victory? Well, that is a bit fuzzier. The fundamental question, and the one people keep rolling over here, is how much this really impacts Ukrainian fighting. Operations tend to be open ended, and as we say with Ukrainian victories, changes happen rapidly after periods of surface stagnation. But from what we can tell now, the key questions are 1) Does the territory conquered seem to change the fundamental dynamics of the front line in ways beneficial to Russia, 2) does it change conditions on other fronts which benefit Russian troops there (for example on the Kharkov or Kherson/Dnepr axis)? 3) Does it deplete Ukrainian forces such that they are not capable of conducting operations on any axis which they would have otherwise done? I would defer to the others currently discussing these factors. But my own opinion is that, again, no. Russia has not changed the battlefield dynamics in any appreciable way which changes the shape of current operations. \n\nSo were left with the tactical level, which is strongly tied to geography. And there you can at least say that, yes, Russia does appear to be taking terrain. They are certainly winning tactical victories. But the question is are they tying these victories together operationally to realize the national objectives of the state? They can win battles, but they have not yet demonstrated the ability to win sufficiently to change the dynamics on other fronts (as the Ukrainians did at Kherson) or which realize major national objectives (like Kherson.)",

To the South of course you have the wire with the Russian forces, and no way will Russia see much success attacking through the fortified city. And east you have Soledar, which if it has fallen does cut off one line of resupply. So the question is: can Russia take Krasna Hora and Ivanivske (losing the former will likely lead to the loss of the city as well, and it is the one closest to Soledar)?\n\nStarting then with Ivanivske, the terrain is mostly open fields and suburban homes--so it can be seized directly (not an urban city). Russia still has to dash through the open fields though, so they will be easy pickings for each successive charge. Can it be held? Yes, with enough men and fire support. However, there is only one main road artery that Russia can cut, and there is a small river between it and Chasiv Yar that Russia may decide to advance to and hold; they may need to move in that direction anyways, to ensure a smaller road through Chasiv Yar is not used to resupply Bakhmut.\n\nFor Krasna Hora, it's under immediate threat if the front is not stabilized quickly. Under normal circumstances, it would be a slog (terrain is trees, fields, homes; it's close enough to Bakhmut though that fire and men could easily be redirected). But if there is a mass retreat from Soledar, and if Russia keeps advancing, it could turn to a rout. Doubt it will happen but there's the risk. If Russia is halted, it's likely Krasna Hora will hold out for weeks if not months. If it does fall, then Bakhmut will be placed under fire control encirclement (where Ukrainian forces doing resupply can be targeted, effectively cutting the city off even if there is not an actual encirclement).\n\nFinal conclusion: if Ukraine routs, then yes of course Bakhmut is under immediate threat. Otherwise, they can hold out for months if not even longer. Ukraine may of course decide to pull out anyways. The line further north (Kramatorsk-Solvyansk) is much, much easier to defend.",

Russia may be rationing artillery rounds due to low supplies, or it could be part of a broader reassessment of tactics in the face of successful Ukrainian offenses.\n\n>Either way, the striking decline in artillery fire is further evidence of Russia\u2019s increasingly weak position on the battlefield nearly a year into its invasion, US and Ukrainian officials told CNN. It also comes as Ukraine is enjoying increased military support from its western allies, with the US and Germany announcing last week that they will be providing Ukrainian forces for the first time with armored fighting vehicles, as well as another Patriot Defense missile battery that will help protect its skies.\n\n>Russian President Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, is apparently clambering to shore up domestic political support, US intelligence officials believe, for a war he initially would only describe as a limited \u201cspecial military operation.\u201d\n\n>US officials believe the 36-hour ceasefire Putin ordered in Ukraine last week to allow for the observance of Orthodox Christmas was an attempt to **pander to Russia\u2019s extensive Christian population**, two people familiar with the intelligence told CNN, as well as an opportunity for Putin to blame Ukrainians for breaking it and paint them as heretical heathens.\n\n>>\u201cThe bucket is getting smaller\u201d\n\n>Much of the domestic opposition Putin and his generals have faced over the handling of the war has come from one of the Russian leader\u2019s closest allies: Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the mercenary organization Wagner Group. Prigozhin has complained that the Russian Ministry of Defense has botched the war effort, and that Wagner Group should be given more equipment, authority and autonomy to carry out operations in Ukraine.\n\n>But Wagner Group has lost thousands of fighters in Ukraine the last two months alone, a senior US official said.\n\n>Russia suffered another setback earlier this month when Ukrainian forces hit a weapons depot in Makiivka in eastern Ukraine, destroying more Russian supplies and killing scores of Russian troops housed nearby. The strike also raised questions among prominent Russian military bloggers about the basic competence of the Russian military brass, which had apparently decided to house hundreds of Russian troops next to an obvious Ukrainian target.\n\n>\u201cMaybe this one strike is a drop in the bucket, but the bucket is getting smaller,\u201d a US defense official said, referring to the Russians\u2019 dwindling stockpiles.\n\n>>40 year-old shells\n\n>To date, questions about Russia\u2019s stockpile of weapons have mostly focused on their precision-guided munitions, such as cruise missiles and ballistic missiles. But US officials said their dramatically reduced rate of artillery fire may indicate that the prolonged and brutal battle has had a significant effect on Russia\u2019s supply of conventional weapons as well.\n\n>Last month, a senior US military official said that Russia has **had to resort to 40-year-old artillery shells as their supply of new ammo dwindled**. To the US, the use of degraded ammunition, as well as the Kremlin\u2019s outreach to countries like North Korea and Iran, was a sign of Russia\u2019s diminished stocks of weaponry.\n\n>The rationing of ammunition and lower rate of fire appears to be a departure from Russian military doctrine, which traditionally calls for the heavy bombardment of a target area with massive artillery fire and rocket fire. That strategy played out in cities like Mariupol and Melitopol as Russian forces used the punishing strikes to drive slow, brutal advances in Ukraine.\n\n>Officials said the strategy shift could be the doing of the recently installed Russian theater commander, General Sergey Surovikin, who the US believes is more competent than his predecessors.\n\n>Ukraine has had little choice but to ration its ammunition since the beginning of the war. Ukrainian troops rapidly burned through their own supply of Soviet-era 152 mm ammunition when the conflict erupted, and while the US and its allies have provided hundreds of thousands of rounds of Western 155 mm ammunition, even this supply has had its limits.\n\n>As a result, Ukraine has averaged firing around 4,000-7,000 artillery rounds per day \u2013 far fewer than Russia.\n\n>>\u201cIt looks ridiculous now\u201d\n\n>The Russians\u2019 declining rate of fire is not linear, one US defense official noted, and there are days when Russians still fire far more artillery rounds \u2013 particularly around the eastern Ukrainian cities of Bakhmut and Kreminna, as well as some near Kherson in the south.\n\n>US and Ukrainian officials have offered widely different estimates of Russian fire, with **US officials saying the rate has dropped from 20,000 rounds per day to around 5,000 per day on average.** Ukraine estimates that the rate has dropped from 60,000 to 20,000 per day.\n\n>But both estimates point to a similar downward trend.\n\n>While Russia still has more artillery ammunition available than Ukraine does, **early US assessments vastly overestimated the amount that Russia had its disposal, a US military official said, and underestimated how well the Ukrainians would do at hitting Russian logistics sites.**\n\n>It appears now that Russia is focused more on bolstering its defense fortifications, particularly in central Zaporizhzhia, the UK Ministry of Defense reported in its regular intelligence update on Sunday. The movements suggest that Moscow is concerned about a potential Ukrainian offensive either there or in Luhansk, the ministry said.\n\n>>\u201cA major Ukrainian breakthrough in Zaporizhzhia would seriously challenge the viability of Russia\u2019s \u2018land-bridge\u2019 linking Russia\u2019s Rostov region and Crimea,\u201d the ministry said, while Ukrainian success in Luhansk would \u201cundermine Russia\u2019s professed war aim of \u2018liberating\u2019 the Donbas.\u201d\n\n>Ukraine\u2019s counter-offensives last fall targeting Kherson in the south and Kharkiv in the north resulted in humiliating defeats for Russia \u2013 and were aided enormously by sophisticated western weaponry like HIMARS rocket launchers, Howitzer artillery systems and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles that the US had previously been reluctant to provide.\n\n>\u201cThe fact of the matter is we have been self-deterring ourselves for over a year now,\u201d said retired Army Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, former commander of US Army Europe and NATO Allied Land Command and currently a senior advisor for Human Rights First.\n\n>>\u201cThere\u2019s been so much anxiety about the possibility of Russia\u2019s escalation \u2013 I mean ten months ago, there was concern about giving Stingers\u2026obviously that\u2019s ridiculous, and it looks ridiculous now.\u201d\n\n>>Russia\u2019s war with bureaucracy\n\n>Tensions between Kremlin defense officials and Wagner Group leaders have also been rising amid public complaints by the mercenaries that they are running low on equipment and reports that their leader, Prigozhin, wants to take control of the lucrative salt mines near Bakhmut.\n\n>In a video that ran on Russian state media, Wagner Group fighters complain that they are running low on combat vehicles, artillery shells and ammunition, which is limiting their ability to conquer Bakhmut \u2013 shortages Prigozhin then blames on \u201cinternal bureaucracy and corruption.\u201d\n\n>\u201cThis year we will win! But first we will conquer our internal bureaucracy and corruption,\u201d he says in the clip. \u201cOnce we conquer our internal bureaucracy and corruption, then we will conquer the Ukrainians and NATO, and then the whole world. The problem now is that the bureaucrats and those engaging in corruption won\u2019t listen to us now because for New Year\u2019s they are all drinking champagne.\u201d\n\n>Prigozhin\u2019s ambitions are **not limited** to greater political power, however, the US believes. There are also indications that he wants to take control over the lucrative salt and gypsum from mines near Bakhmut, a senior administration official tells CNN.\n\n>\u201cThis is consistent with Wagner\u2019s modus operandi in Africa, where the group\u2019s military activities often function hand in hand with control of mining assets,\u201d the official said, adding that the **US believes these monetary incentives are driving Prigozhin and Russia\u2019s \u201cobsession\u201d with taking Bakhmut**.\n\n>The official also said that Wagner Group has suffered heavy casualties in its operations near Bakhmut since late November.\n\n>\u201cOut of its force of nearly 50,000 mercenaries (including 40,000 convicts), the company has sustained over 4,100 killed and 10,000 wounded, including over 1,000 killed between late November and early December near Bakhmut,\u201d the official said, adding that about 90% of those killed were convicts.\n\n>The official said that Russia \u201ccannot sustain these kinds of losses.\u201d\n\n>>\u201cIf Russia does eventually seize Bakhmut, Russia will surely characterize this, misleadingly, as a \u2018major victory,\u201d the official added. \u201cBut we know that is not the case. If the cost for each 36 square miles of Ukraine [the approximate size of Bakhmut] is thousands of Russians over seven months, this is the definition of Pyrrhic victory.\u201d",

Prigozhin has complained that the Russian Ministry of Defense has botched the war effort, and that Wagner Group should be given more equipment, authority and autonomy to carry out operations in Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>But Wagner Group has lost thousands of fighters in Ukraine the last two months alone, a senior US official said.</p>\n\n<p>Russia suffered another setback earlier this month when Ukrainian forces hit a weapons depot in Makiivka in eastern Ukraine, destroying more Russian supplies and killing scores of Russian troops housed nearby. The strike also raised questions among prominent Russian military bloggers about the basic competence of the Russian military brass, which had apparently decided to house hundreds of Russian troops next to an obvious Ukrainian target.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMaybe this one strike is a drop in the bucket, but the bucket is getting smaller,\u201d a US defense official said, referring to the Russians\u2019 dwindling stockpiles.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>40 year-old shells</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To date, questions about Russia\u2019s stockpile of weapons have mostly focused on their precision-guided munitions, such as cruise missiles and ballistic missiles. But US officials said their dramatically reduced rate of artillery fire may indicate that the prolonged and brutal battle has had a significant effect on Russia\u2019s supply of conventional weapons as well.</p>\n\n<p>Last month, a senior US military official said that Russia has <strong>had to resort to 40-year-old artillery shells as their supply of new ammo dwindled</strong>. To the US, the use of degraded ammunition, as well as the Kremlin\u2019s outreach to countries like North Korea and Iran, was a sign of Russia\u2019s diminished stocks of weaponry.</p>\n\n<p>The rationing of ammunition and lower rate of fire appears to be a departure from Russian military doctrine, which traditionally calls for the heavy bombardment of a target area with massive artillery fire and rocket fire. That strategy played out in cities like Mariupol and Melitopol as Russian forces used the punishing strikes to drive slow, brutal advances in Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>Officials said the strategy shift could be the doing of the recently installed Russian theater commander, General Sergey Surovikin, who the US believes is more competent than his predecessors.</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine has had little choice but to ration its ammunition since the beginning of the war. Ukrainian troops rapidly burned through their own supply of Soviet-era 152 mm ammunition when the conflict erupted, and while the US and its allies have provided hundreds of thousands of rounds of Western 155 mm ammunition, even this supply has had its limits.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, Ukraine has averaged firing around 4,000-7,000 artillery rounds per day \u2013 far fewer than Russia.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cIt looks ridiculous now\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Russians\u2019 declining rate of fire is not linear, one US defense official noted, and there are days when Russians still fire far more artillery rounds \u2013 particularly around the eastern Ukrainian cities of Bakhmut and Kreminna, as well as some near Kherson in the south.</p>\n\n<p>US and Ukrainian officials have offered widely different estimates of Russian fire, with <strong>US officials saying the rate has dropped from 20,000 rounds per day to around 5,000 per day on average.</strong> Ukraine estimates that the rate has dropped from 60,000 to 20,000 per day.</p>\n\n<p>But both estimates point to a similar downward trend.</p>\n\n<p>While Russia still has more artillery ammunition available than Ukraine does, <strong>early US assessments vastly overestimated the amount that Russia had its disposal, a US military official said, and underestimated how well the Ukrainians would do at hitting Russian logistics sites.</strong></p>\n\n<p>It appears now that Russia is focused more on bolstering its defense fortifications, particularly in central Zaporizhzhia, the UK Ministry of Defense reported in its regular intelligence update on Sunday. The movements suggest that Moscow is concerned about a potential Ukrainian offensive either there or in Luhansk, the ministry said.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cA major Ukrainian breakthrough in Zaporizhzhia would seriously challenge the viability of Russia\u2019s \u2018land-bridge\u2019 linking Russia\u2019s Rostov region and Crimea,\u201d the ministry said, while Ukrainian success in Luhansk would \u201cundermine Russia\u2019s professed war aim of \u2018liberating\u2019 the Donbas.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ukraine\u2019s counter-offensives last fall targeting Kherson in the south and Kharkiv in the north resulted in humiliating defeats for Russia \u2013 and were aided enormously by sophisticated western weaponry like HIMARS rocket launchers, Howitzer artillery systems and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles that the US had previously been reluctant to provide.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe fact of the matter is we have been self-deterring ourselves for over a year now,\u201d said retired Army Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, former commander of US Army Europe and NATO Allied Land Command and currently a senior advisor for Human Rights First.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s been so much anxiety about the possibility of Russia\u2019s escalation \u2013 I mean ten months ago, there was concern about giving Stingers\u2026obviously that\u2019s ridiculous, and it looks ridiculous now.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Russia\u2019s war with bureaucracy</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Tensions between Kremlin defense officials and Wagner Group leaders have also been rising amid public complaints by the mercenaries that they are running low on equipment and reports that their leader, Prigozhin, wants to take control of the lucrative salt mines near Bakhmut.</p>\n\n<p>In a video that ran on Russian state media, Wagner Group fighters complain that they are running low on combat vehicles, artillery shells and ammunition, which is limiting their ability to conquer Bakhmut \u2013 shortages Prigozhin then blames on \u201cinternal bureaucracy and corruption.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis year we will win! But first we will conquer our internal bureaucracy and corruption,\u201d he says in the clip. \u201cOnce we conquer our internal bureaucracy and corruption, then we will conquer the Ukrainians and NATO, and then the whole world. The problem now is that the bureaucrats and those engaging in corruption won\u2019t listen to us now because for New Year\u2019s they are all drinking champagne.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Prigozhin\u2019s ambitions are <strong>not limited</strong> to greater political power, however, the US believes. There are also indications that he wants to take control over the lucrative salt and gypsum from mines near Bakhmut, a senior administration official tells CNN.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis is consistent with Wagner\u2019s modus operandi in Africa, where the group\u2019s military activities often function hand in hand with control of mining assets,\u201d the official said, adding that the <strong>US believes these monetary incentives are driving Prigozhin and Russia\u2019s \u201cobsession\u201d with taking Bakhmut</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>The official also said that Wagner Group has suffered heavy casualties in its operations near Bakhmut since late November.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOut of its force of nearly 50,000 mercenaries (including 40,000 convicts), the company has sustained over 4,100 killed and 10,000 wounded, including over 1,000 killed between late November and early December near Bakhmut,\u201d the official said, adding that about 90% of those killed were convicts.</p>\n\n<p>The official said that Russia \u201ccannot sustain these kinds of losses.\u201d</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cIf Russia does eventually seize Bakhmut, Russia will surely characterize this, misleadingly, as a \u2018major victory,\u201d the official added. \u201cBut we know that is not the case. If the cost for each 36 square miles of Ukraine [the approximate size of Bakhmut] is thousands of Russians over seven months, this is the definition of Pyrrhic victory.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Having found it, <strong>he can wallow unrestrainedly in exactly those emotions from which he believes that he has emancipated himself. God, the King, the Empire, the Union Jack \u2013 all the overthrown idols can reappear under different names, and because they are not recognized for what they are they can be worshipped with a good conscience.</strong> Transferred nationalism, like the use of scapegoats, is a way of attaining salvation without altering one\u2019s conduct.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/notes-on-nationalism/\">https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/notes-on-nationalism/</a></p>\n</div>",

Similarly, a life guard doesn't offer a drowning person the choice to drown. The only time it happens is when circumstances don't allow a rescue, which isn't what we're dealing with now.\n\nWhich is a battle that's lasted about seven months, with UAF troops all around Soledar in force the whole time, they had the time and resources to evacuate them all. But someone CHOSE not to because they didn't want to. And there should be repercussions for those decisions, just like allowing someone to burn to death or drown. That's a bad decision, those making them should be punished for it.\n\nAlso, the UAF already said they were forced to do perform costly positional defenses in the Donbas months back in order to save the very civilians they're not evacuating.

The Marine Corps plans to equip the regiment with advanced capabilities, such as anti-ship missiles that could be fired at Chinese ships in the event of a Taiwan conflict.</p>\n\n<p>The shake-up on Okinawa follows the establishment of a similar unit in Hawaii. There, the Marine Corps took an existing infantry headquarters \u2014 the 3rd Marine Regiment \u2014 and turned it into the 3rd Marine Littoral Regiment. In Okinawa, the Marine Corps will repurpose the 12th Marine Regiment, an artillery headquarters, to create the 12th Marine Littoral Regiment. The service also plans to transfer an infantry headquarters now on Okinawa, the 4th Marine Regiment, to Guam, where it could serve as the basis of the third littoral regiment beginning in 2027, a third U.S. official said. That unit will be called the 4th Marine Littoral Regiment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

We made it in our laboratory with the use of some frills, and although it has been outdated for a long time, it showed some resistance to enemy electronic warfare. We got it off the shelf, because recently all these DJIs, supplied in abundance to the troops by volunteers, began to fall from the sky like rain - the enemy intensified the anti-drone fight to the maximum.\n\nBut here the question is: how and with what? The bird flew safely to where the copters did not even fly close, when suddenly a rocket hit it. There this bird - one and a half meters in scope - and a rocket .... Immediately there was a suspicion that they were guided by radio emission - you can\u2019t detect an electric machine by the generated heat. And they didn\u2019t spare the rockets! - how much they protect the sky above them now.\n\nWhat do we have from that? And we need to rebuild the system.

In a month, the enemy will have neither air defense nor means of destruction, without which the infantry is powerless. What is needed for this?
