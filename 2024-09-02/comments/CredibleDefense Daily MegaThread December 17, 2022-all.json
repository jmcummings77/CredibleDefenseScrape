Don't forget or minimize their role in this, lest after Putin there's a Putin 2.0 just as everyone assumes that without Putin russia is once again safe and friendly despite the system and rhetoric staying the same.\n\n\nEDIT: oh yeah, these last few paragraphs illustrate it pretty well\n\n>  Aleksandr, the soldier drafted into the 155th, is still enraged at the way he and his comrades were dropped into Ukraine with few bullets for their aging rifles and forced to live in a cowshed with only a few meal packets to share.

He and another suffered concussions. One lost both legs. The fourth is missing.</p>\n\n<p>But when he is discharged from the hospital, he said, he fully expects to return to Ukraine, and would do so willingly.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis is how we are raised,\u201d he said. \u201cWe grew up in our country understanding that it doesn\u2019t matter how our country treats us.

Do keep in mind that it's autotranslated and hasn't been edited in any way, so ask if anything seems weird about the wording or whatever.\n\n# Finnish expert: The balance of power in the war in Ukraine is changing completely\n\n#### Russia's large-scale mobilisation is potentially turning the tide of the war much earlier than expected.\n\n**YRJ\u00d6 KOKKONEN**  \n16.12. 17:14\n\nUpdated 16.12. 20:19\n\nRussia's mobilisation in September looked like a messy project, but as a result the Ukrainian war is changing dramatically, says Ilmari K\u00e4ihk\u00f6, a visiting scholar at the Alexander Institute.\n\nUkrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov said yesterday (Thursday) in an interview with the Guardian (go to another service) that Russia could launch a major offensive with mobilised troops as early as around the turn of the year. The same message has also been conveyed by the Ukrainian military command.\n\nMany Western military experts have estimated that Russia might not have the resources for a major offensive until late spring at the earliest.\n\nAccording to K\u00e4ihk\u00f6n, it is not known what intelligence Ukraine has at its disposal, but he takes the announcement of an imminent threat of attack seriously. The Russian soldiers mobilised in the autumn are already on the front line and have strengthened Russia's force, despite the fact that they may have been poorly trained, ill-equipped and unmotivated.\n\nThe hundreds of thousands of mobilised soldiers will have a major impact on the course of the war, says K\u00e4ihk\u00f6.\n\n- According to Russian President Vladimir Putin, there are 318 000 mobilised, which is a huge number of men, considering that Russia had only 200 000 soldiers when it invaded in February. So this will change the balance of power and the dynamics of the war quite a bit,\" K\u00e4ihk\u00f6 says.\n\nK\u00e4ihk\u00f6 regrets that attention in the West was focused on the confusion over the implementation of the mobilisation, which led to an underestimation of Russia's military power. In Ukraine, Russia's strength has not been underestimated, K\u00e4ihk\u00f6 says.\n\n## Is Ukraine getting tired?\n\nUkraine has already been expected to launch its own offensive, perhaps to retake more of the territory occupied by Russia. Ukraine is known to have concentrated troops in the Zaporizhzhya region, suggesting that the offensive might be directed towards Melitopol.\n\nAccording to Western estimates, Ukraine would be well placed to attack during the winter, when the frozen ground is carrying tanks and Russia has not yet deployed new troops.\n\nIf Ukraine is able to launch a counter-attack, it will be slower than in the past because Russia has done extensive fortification work behind the front lines, K\u00e4ihk\u00f6 says.\n\nA possible Russian strike in just a couple of weeks would confuse Ukraine's potential offensive plans.\n\nAn attack would also require a lot of resources, including ammunition depots. Ukraine has been complaining about ammunition shortages for most of the war. It is therefore doubtful that, even if it launched an attack, it would be able to achieve its objectives.\n\nRussia has been waging a very consuming frontal war around the town of Bahmut in Donbas throughout the autumn.\n\nThese battles have been fought with a few tens of thousands of troops. If Russia is now about to get, say, 150 000 more troops on the front, the scale of the fighting would change to a completely different scale,\" says K\u00e4ihk\u00f6.\n\nAccording to Ukrainian sources, Russia could be planning an attack from up to three directions, including again towards Kiev.\n\n## K\u00e4ihk\u00f6: West must step up arms production\n\nIlmari K\u00e4ihk\u00f6 believes it is important for the West to rapidly expand its arms aid to Ukraine if Ukraine is to win the war. Prolonging the war would help Russia in particular, as Ukraine's economy is collapsing. Russia's economy is also contracting as a result of the sanctions, but not as fast as that of the much smaller Ukraine.\n\nMr K\u00e4ihk\u00f6 points out that Russia has long since ramped up its ammunition production, for example, to meet the needs of the war. Ukraine, for its part, has feared that the West would simply not produce enough ammunition to defend Ukraine if the war dragged on.\n\n- We too should get the industry up and running, because it will not happen overnight. Decisions should have been taken already to have an impact in the next six months,\" he says.\n\nAt the same time, Russia is trying to destroy Ukraine's industry with devastating missile strikes on its infrastructure.",

It's crucial for Russia to advance in this direction if they have any hope of enveloping the city from the South/West. Optyne and Ivanhrad immediately South of Bakhmut are still holding despite withering fire from Russian forces. To the East, Russian forces are already assaulting the furthest reaches of Bakhmut proper, but its tough going. To the far Northeast Russia captured Yakovlivka recently, which is important for their efforts to take Soledar. Soledar itself has been the scene of heavy fighting for many months now, but the Russians have little to show for their losses. \n\nAll in all, the situation is stable and the city is unlikely to fall for months, if it ever actually does. Ukraine has moved a number of its best units to the area to assist in its defense over the past week and they've stabilized the lines.",

To the East, Russian forces are already assaulting the furthest reaches of Bakhmut proper, but its tough going.

Hard to say.\n\nTheir flash update talks about 7,832,493 refugees across Europe, which is close enough to the total number of refugees in Russia + Europe. I wonder if it accounts for people who went to Europe via Russia, or if that number is insignificant? Same question about DNR and LNR refugees, are there many of them?\n\nStill a massive number in any case",
