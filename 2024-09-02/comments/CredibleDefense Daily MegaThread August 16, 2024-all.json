This one was a much more broader discussion which I personally found more interesting.\n\nKey takeaways from my perspective:\n\n- Advances are slowing down, Kofman thinks its possible positions will be consolidated as soon as this weekend (note ep was recorded on the 15th). \n- More forces are being brought in by Ukraine and these are getting pulled off the front line.\n- In terms of losses - Lee says that Ukraine is holding back lots of their footage and the loss ratios talked about now are likely going to change. Overall the operation was relatively low on casualties and the people Lee spoke to on the ground seemed positive about it. \n- Both thought that originally this was a much more limited operation, which got reinforced when they found unexpected success. Limited objectives where achieved: pows, narrative, morale, political, but nothing major so far.\n- Lots and lots of discussions around long term impacts. Hard to summarise effectively. Kofman felt that there was a fairly safe trajectory for Ukraine re reinforcements / fortifications and Russian manpower issues coming into winter (pre offensive). Now this is much more fluid, uncertainty etc. This operation could really impact the trajectory of the war.\n- Lee says that the Ukrainians are clearly here to stay and the strategy is to embarrass the Russians into sending assault units to dislodge them (hence talk of humanitarian relief, military administration)\n- Comparison again to Krynky - this time they addressed their thoughts a bit more directly - they felt Krynky was costly to Ukraine (esp Naval infantry) but due to Russian overinvestment in sending VDV, instead of just blasting them from a distance, it ended up being not too bad for Ukraine (not a success but not a disaster). Same goes for Kursk - will the Russians just box them in and blast them or will they overinvest in trying to dislodge them?\n- The offensive was very well organised - multiple effects EW, UAV support, artillery support. Possibly indicates that Ukraine has learned from the lessons of the summer offensive. Russia still does not handle dynamic situations very well, much better in established fronts with clear C2. \n- US doesn't seem to know what Ukraine's objectives are, and was not informed in advance of the offensive.\n\nThey announced there will be another episode ideally next week to discuss progress of the offensive. Note that this summary is quite a small slice of what was discussed and I highly recommend listening to this episode in full. \n\nThere was also another podcast released in the last couple of days on this offensive on geopolitics decanted with Constantine Kalinovskiy (@Teoyaomiquu). \n\nhttps://geopolitics-decanted.simplecast.com/episodes/ukraine-invades-russia-whats-next-interview-with-ukrainian-combat-vet\n\nI'm not going to summarise this one as its publicly available and worth listening to as well.

            "body": "As per my understanding,\n\n1.\u00a0How has Russia not bombed the Ukrainians to dust? Russia, as we\u2019re often reminded, has air superiority over Ukraine\u2014and, certainly over their own territory as well. Kyiv\u2019s months of targeting Russia\u2019s anti-air systems, air bases, and electronic warfare stations in the region were, as we now know, a'softening\u2019 operation\u2014an effort to reduce both Russia\u2019s defensive capacity in the region and its ability to retake the territory. Ukraine also planned for Russia\u2019s aerial bombardment, and brought with it ample anti-air systems. Kyiv may have even dispatched some of its dwindling supply of fighter jets to ward off Russian bombers.\u00a0The arrival of those F-16s immediately prior to the mission is probably a good indication, too, that Ukraine conceived of a complex effort to deny Russia air cover over the region.\n\nBut that, alone, doesn\u2019t answer the question. While we will need to wait for the dust to settle before we can truly appreciate how Ukrainian innovation made this incursion possible, Russian channels have that Ukraine managed a blitz of disruptive tactics meant to scramble Russian jets, drones, and missiles; disrupt radio communication; and thwart radar.\n\n2. Now the big question, How are the Russians taking this?\u00a0Not well. I\u2019ve been tracking the response from the milbloggers since the Ukrainians first broke through the border, and their response has gone through all the stages of grief. Tellingly, however, they have struggled to stick to any sort of line, occasionally drifting into angry fatalism. Take this one assessment from a popular milblogger, who lamented that Ukraine struck \u201csuccessfully\u201d and that Russia lacked the capacity to dislodge them, at least for the time being:\n\n**Svyatoslav Golikov:**\u00a0From our side, reserves continue to arrive. At the same time, the forces involved are still not enough even for sustainable stabilization of the situation, not to mention the defeat of the enemy. They are lacking not only quantitatively but also qualitatively. On the enemy's side, they have fairly well-staffed units and formations. So far we have a patchwork of fire brigades, and they are scarce in numbers.\n\nThis milblogger also took direct aim at Chief of Defense Staff Valery Gerasimov. This is just one example of these military/political analysts openly pointing to the rot at the top of the military leadership and the absurdity at the core of this \u2018special military operation\u2019 \u2014 careful, of course, to never criticize Putin, just his cronies.\n\nThis should harken back to Yevgeny Prigozhin\u2019s \u2018March of Justice.\u2019 when things were so dire in the war that the Wagner Group boss took his mercenary group and attempted to stage a slow-motion coup. (Prigozhin\u2019s main target, defence minister Sergei Shoigu, was subsequently\u00a0sacked\u00a0and may be in\u00a0even more trouble today.)\n\nThere were also the \u00a0RUMINT that the remnants of Prigozhin\u2019s Wagner Group, which had been largely exiled to West Africa and the Sahel, were redeployed back to Kursk and may form part of that \u2018fire brigade.\u2019\n\nThe milbloggers have kvetched and complained often, but the degree of their disgruntlement is always a useful barometer for the state of the war. This is particularly true, as Putin has continued tuning the screws on the limits of acceptable dissent \u2014 a spate of\u00a0suspicious deaths\u00a0and arbitrary detentions, coupled with a new law that lets the state seize assets of those who \u201cdiscredit\u201d the military all portend the Kremlin\u2019s\u00a0loss of patience\u00a0with the armchair generals. The fact that they are complaining this loudly, despite the risks, is notable. Thus, Moscow, however, may be facing a point in the not-too-distant future where a second, substantial,\u00a0mobilization\u00a0will be required to keep its war going. If that comes to pass, these criticisms of this brutal and bungled war may become incredibly salient.\n\n3. How Clever is Ukraine's incursion into Russia? The big question is whether Ukraine will be successful in the Kursk operation.\u00a0Much depends on the rapidity of the Russians response and the ability of the Ukrainian forces to dig in and hold ground. While the operation is military, the outcome hoped for is political.\u00a0There is no doubt it is a big gamble.\u00a0It upsets the Russian stodgy and systematic approach to territorial conquest.\u00a0 But it risks a huge reaction and utter defeat if it fails prematurely.\u00a0It isn't clear how quickly the Ukrainians will jump at trying to force a negotiation with Russia, nor is it clear that the Russians will take the bait. Although, this sort of operation is, so far as I understand, is right up to the Syrskyi\u2019s alley. \n\nI also have a strong suspicion that Ukraine is in the process of rebooting its ground forces through a process of triage that flows resources to units that prove themselves in the field. Certain brigades with effective staffs and leaders may even be expanded into something more like a division.\n\nThis is a proven technique, but it comes with a harsh flip side: some units get starved of reinforcements until they\u2019re simply ineffective, at which point they\u2019re rotated to the rear and probably reconstructed. A hazard of successful operations like the one in Kursk is that it can exacerbate feelings in battered brigades of being treated unfairly. This can lead to persistent low morale that in turn causes a cycle of under-investment and poor performance. A unit so afflicted can quickly become a liability under fire.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that this is definitely happening, but it\u2019s a risk to be wary of. With Moscow trying to target the weakest member of the herd, so to speak, Ukraine may have to consider pulling some brigades for reconstruction and deploying newly raised ones sooner than it would like.",

They are lacking not only quantitatively but also qualitatively. On the enemy&#39;s side, they have fairly well-staffed units and formations. So far we have a patchwork of fire brigades, and they are scarce in numbers.</p>\n\n<p>This milblogger also took direct aim at Chief of Defense Staff Valery Gerasimov. This is just one example of these military/political analysts openly pointing to the rot at the top of the military leadership and the absurdity at the core of this \u2018special military operation\u2019 \u2014 careful, of course, to never criticize Putin, just his cronies.</p>\n\n<p>This should harken back to Yevgeny Prigozhin\u2019s \u2018March of Justice.\u2019 when things were so dire in the war that the Wagner Group boss took his mercenary group and attempted to stage a slow-motion coup. (Prigozhin\u2019s main target, defence minister Sergei Shoigu, was subsequently\u00a0sacked\u00a0and may be in\u00a0even more trouble today.)</p>\n\n<p>There were also the \u00a0RUMINT that the remnants of Prigozhin\u2019s Wagner Group, which had been largely exiled to West Africa and the Sahel, were redeployed back to Kursk and may form part of that \u2018fire brigade.\u2019</p>\n\n<p>The milbloggers have kvetched and complained often, but the degree of their disgruntlement is always a useful barometer for the state of the war. This is particularly true, as Putin has continued tuning the screws on the limits of acceptable dissent \u2014 a spate of\u00a0suspicious deaths\u00a0and arbitrary detentions, coupled with a new law that lets the state seize assets of those who \u201cdiscredit\u201d the military all portend the Kremlin\u2019s\u00a0loss of patience\u00a0with the armchair generals. The fact that they are complaining this loudly, despite the risks, is notable. Thus, Moscow, however, may be facing a point in the not-too-distant future where a second, substantial,\u00a0mobilization\u00a0will be required to keep its war going. If that comes to pass, these criticisms of this brutal and bungled war may become incredibly salient.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>How Clever is Ukraine&#39;s incursion into Russia? The big question is whether Ukraine will be successful in the Kursk operation.\u00a0Much depends on the rapidity of the Russians response and the ability of the Ukrainian forces to dig in and hold ground. While the operation is military, the outcome hoped for is political.\u00a0There is no doubt it is a big gamble.\u00a0It upsets the Russian stodgy and systematic approach to territorial conquest.\u00a0 But it risks a huge reaction and utter defeat if it fails prematurely.\u00a0It isn&#39;t clear how quickly the Ukrainians will jump at trying to force a negotiation with Russia, nor is it clear that the Russians will take the bait. Although, this sort of operation is, so far as I understand, is right up to the Syrskyi\u2019s alley. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I also have a strong suspicion that Ukraine is in the process of rebooting its ground forces through a process of triage that flows resources to units that prove themselves in the field. Certain brigades with effective staffs and leaders may even be expanded into something more like a division.</p>\n\n<p>This is a proven technique, but it comes with a harsh flip side: some units get starved of reinforcements until they\u2019re simply ineffective, at which point they\u2019re rotated to the rear and probably reconstructed. A hazard of successful operations like the one in Kursk is that it can exacerbate feelings in battered brigades of being treated unfairly. This can lead to persistent low morale that in turn causes a cycle of under-investment and poor performance. A unit so afflicted can quickly become a liability under fire.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m not saying that this is definitely happening, but it\u2019s a risk to be wary of. With Moscow trying to target the weakest member of the herd, so to speak, Ukraine may have to consider pulling some brigades for reconstruction and deploying newly raised ones sooner than it would like.</p>\n</div>",

For Chinese leaders, the goal would be to avoid the spread of nuclear contamination, and they would hope that the presence of Chinese troops at these facilities would forestall a number of frightening scenarios: China could prevent accidents at the facilities; deter the United States, South Korea, or Japan from striking them; and block the North Koreans from using or sabotaging their weapons.\n\n> Beijing is also concerned that a reunified Korea might inherit the North\u2019s nuclear capabilities.

The basis of the relationship dynamics between China and the DPRK go back to the late Qing Dynasty which, to be plain, completely abandoned Korea to the predations of Japanese imperialism. The Korean Joseon government had refused to establish relations with Japan explicitly due to their loyalty to China and (misplaced) faith in its capacity to come to Korea's rescue as the Ming once did against Japan's invasion in the late 16th century. The Qing, having just lost their own war against Japan, were in no position to do so. The Japanese pretext for initiating its imperialist assault on Korea actually began with the pretext of \"opening it up\" as a direct result of this Korean diplomatic refusal. This soon forced Korea to sign its first unequal treaty with Japan and began the catastrophically traumatic Japanese invasion of Korea. The sense of Qing China having failed to live up to its obligations, and with such calamitous consequences for Korea, is the historical essence which permeates both Chinese and Korean perceptions.\n\nThis sense of past failure in historical obligations alongside socialist solidarity, a further indebtedness to Korean aid against Japan in Northeast China and pragmatic realpolitik calculus towards counter-containing the expansion of the American containment doctrine from reaching the Yalu River, were the reasons why China intervened in the Korean War. Following this, the China-DPRK relationship was actually the inverse of the big nation-small nation power dynamic for most of the 20th century, precisely because both sides were deeply historically cognizant of not making the relationship seem like such, particularly since China, following the Sino-Soviet split, had a vested interest in not making itself also appear to be the overbearing big brother when it was simultaneously accusing the USSR of being a \"big nation chauvinist\" within the socialist world.\n\nTo this end, the power asymmetry of the relationship under Mao actually came to skew towards the DPRK, with Mao personally offering Kim Il Sung de facto military and administrative control of Northeast China as the DPRK's \"great hinterland\" and the border around Mount Paektu/Changbaishan was amended so that the DPRK would possess half of the mountain alongside its highest peak. At a time where the Sino-Soviet rupture had isolated China from fraternal nations that sided with the USSR, such as Mongolia and Vietnam, it became imperative for China to maintain its friendship with the DPRK. The DPRK under Kim Il Sung therefore not only benefitted from such asymmetry, but also could always fall back on the triangular relationship with the USSR to further cushion its position.\n\nThe Chinese perception of the Mao era relationship here is very telling, because Deng Xiaoping actually articulated it when the DPRK tried to block China's normalization process with South Korea: \"We should draw lessons from our dealings with North Korea. We should not give the North Koreans the wrong impression that whatever they ask for we will give them.\" Deng saw China's relationship with the DPRK as not only asymmetric, but also the teleological next domino to fall over after the ruptures in similar relationships where China once gave great sacrifices to maintain: \u201cOf course, the North Koreans are unhappy. Let it be. We should prevent them from dragging us into trouble. We have made huge efforts to aid Vietnam, Albania, and North Korea. Now Vietnam and Albania have fallen out with us. We should be prepared for the third one \\[North Korea\\] to fall out with us, though we should try our best to prevent that from happening.\u201d\n\nThis perception, became coupled with revisionist views of the Korean War that \"if only China didn't intervene (and fight America and the 'United Nations' coalition to a stalemate), America might have even let China have Taiwan back,\" which resonated particularly in the midst of the 3rd Taiwan Strait Crisis in the 1990s.\n\nWhen China's FM informed Kim Il Sung that it was going to normalize relations with South Korea, Kim allegedly responded \"The DPRK will adhere to socialism and will overcome any difficulties on its own.\u201d This mindset, along with the collapse of the USSR, is what led the DPRK to pursue an independent nuclear program outside of China's nuclear umbrella. The disappearence of the USSR, its abandonment by Yeltsin's Russia and the semi-estrangement with China following the latter's normalization with the South at the end of the 20th century would have held undeniable parallels to the Qing failure to rescue Joseon Korea at the end of the 19th century. This justified, from the DPRK's perspective, the idea that only with its own nuclear capabilities, could it be truly safe.\n\n China's response against the nuclear missile tests in the 2000s was explicit condemnation, but I'd argue the more important reason, and the reason why Russia also joined China in supporting the American annual renewal of sanctions in the UNSC is the, in their view, disastrous precedent in terms of non-proliferation. If the DPRK could argue that the Chinese and Russian nuclear umbrellas were no longer sufficient, US-aligned nations like Japan and South Korea could also use it as a pretext to develop their own nuclear weapons. The nuclear proliferation of the DPRK has been the defining impediment hamstringing the last two decades which contributes to the undercurrents of tension in the Sino-Korean relationship. To be clear, the two countries are still allies and China's treaty with the DPRK is the only explicit alliance it has in effect today. But the New Cold War has changed the dynamics of East Asian geopolitics considerably as both Japan and South Korea have openly sided with the US, something that China might have had some hopes against. This alignment with the US lessens China's fear of condoning DPRK proliferation in affecting its bilateral decision making. This fear, that condonement would lead to the proliferation of the US \"vassals\", is now less significant.",

David W. Allvin said this week. But there\u2019s one change in particular he is concerned may face some headwinds: the new Integrated Capabilities Command. \n\n> The service wants to establish the command, to be led by a three-star general, by the end of this year. ICC is meant to centralize and streamline the Air Force\u2019s process for setting future requirements, while freeing other commands to focus more on current needs. [...]\n\n> \u201cI would say the one\u2014for the vision that I have at least\u2014is probably a sort of a final answer on Integrated Capabilities Command,\u201d he said at the Pentagon on Aug. 14. \u201cOn the other ones, we already sort of have a path, as we know when we\u2019re going to change out the wing structures, how we\u2019re going to change out the commanders, and all that. \u2026 We have AFFORGEN to be able to develop and generate the readiness for that. That system is going to be in place.\u201d\n\n> In contrast, Integrated Capabilities Command requires setting up a headquarters, which means it will receive special attention from lawmakers and will need Congressional approval.

David W. Allvin said this week. But there\u2019s one change in particular he is concerned may face some headwinds: the new Integrated Capabilities Command. </p>\n\n<p>The service wants to establish the command, to be led by a three-star general, by the end of this year. ICC is meant to centralize and streamline the Air Force\u2019s process for setting future requirements, while freeing other commands to focus more on current needs. [...]</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI would say the one\u2014for the vision that I have at least\u2014is probably a sort of a final answer on Integrated Capabilities Command,\u201d he said at the Pentagon on Aug. 14. \u201cOn the other ones, we already sort of have a path, as we know when we\u2019re going to change out the wing structures, how we\u2019re going to change out the commanders, and all that. \u2026 We have AFFORGEN to be able to develop and generate the readiness for that. That system is going to be in place.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, Integrated Capabilities Command requires setting up a headquarters, which means it will receive special attention from lawmakers and will need Congressional approval. [...]</p>\n\n<p>In late May, Allvin said around 500-800 Airmen would be working for Integrated Capabilities Command at the start.

The only way you take territory like that is if the enemy abandons it - which is why air supremacy is so important, if you can bomb them out of their defences then they become meaningless. (That&#39;s how the west won the Gulf War for example.) Ukraine doesn&#39;t have the capability to force Russia to abandon with airstrikes, so they need to force it economically or politically.</p>\n\n<p>In Kursk there is no prepared defence and minimal armed forces or air cover (and almost no artillery so far, apparently). It&#39;s more like Kharkhiv &#39;22.</p>\n</div>",

They (what the Ukrainians call \"dowries\" of a given brigade) are assigned by TDF or infantry brigades, or they are separate rifle battalions - but it can also happen they are a consolidate unit of a Training Center, of the State Transport Special Service, of an artillery brigade, of the State Border Guard Service or of a protection unit of the National Guard. The purpose is to enhance the infantry endowment of a mechanized / air assault brigade etc, as well as because their original brigade does not have the HQ Staff and/or the means to operate independently in a given section of the front. \n\nIn the case of the 47th Mechanized Brigade, in fact it has been fighting for months thanks to these rifle battalions assigned to it, which do the bulk of the infantry fighting. To my knowledge, some counterattacks using Bradleys have seen infantrymen belonging to subunits of the 142nd Infantry Brigade as dismounts, for example. There is a limited involvement of subunits that are formally part of the brigade, which are committed on a rotational basis when they regain some combat capability. Abrams and Bradleys are used to carry out counterattacks and support units assigned to the 47th Brigade, or to support other nearby brigades. In recent months, among others, some battalions of several TDF brigades (primarily the 114th, 120th and 122nd) have been assigned to the 47th Mechanized Brigade, also most of the battalions of the 142nd and 144th Infantry Brigades, as well as receiving replenishments in form of men from the 18th Army Aviation Brigade. In [this instance](https://i.imgur.com/bkigDkA.png), we see 2 MIA notices of infantrymen from the 469th Rifle Battalion of the 144th Infantry Brigade, assigned to the 47th Mechanized Brigade, and missing after the battle for Sokil. During July, the 151st Mechanized Brigade was transferred to the Pokrovsk sector, but as far as [I could find](https://i.imgur.com/b99sooS.png), its battalions were assigned to the operational subordination of the 47th Mechanized Brigade (another battalion to that of the 110th Mechanized Brigade) - an indication that this (new) brigade is likely lacking in terms of HQ Staff. By the way, the HQ of the 47th Mechanized Brigade is somewhat of a \"primus inter pares\" among the brigades deployed in the Pokrovsk sector, and e.g. the brigade's artillery group and its Strike UAV Battalion are very active. \n\nAnyway, that's more or less the same system the Russians use, with the regiments of the Territorial Forces. They either attach them to a \"regular\" brigade/regiment or disband the unit altogether and send its members to \u201cregular\u201d units as stormtroopers. An example, among many, is [this one](https://i.imgur.com/aQlo5DI.png) I had put up some time ago - the 1219th Regiment of the Territorial Forces was disbanded, according to relatives of its servicemen, and the soldiers sent to the 5th Motorized Brigade (51st CAA), engaged in the battle of Krasnohorivka. Recently, in the Kherson sector, men of the 1253rd Regiment of the Territorial Forces were forcibly transferred to the assault companies of the regiments of the 70th Motorized Division (18th CAA), which had losses in the battles for Krynky and, currently, for the marshy islands between the Dnipro and Konka Rivers.\n\nhttps://t. me/vdv_za_chestnost_spravedlivost/3329\n\nhttps://t. me/vdv_za_chestnost_spravedlivost/3357",

Just Google \"Iran attack imminent\" and look at the results. For almost two weeks now, news article after news article talked about Iran's \"imminent\" reprisal. The attack was supposed to occur on August 3 or 4. Then during the week. Then on Tisha B'Av, on Monday. That said, I'm glad nothing's happened so far. It makes me think about the Ukraine War in the following way. The international community warned Russia against invading Ukraine. Those warnings contained credible threats. Russia invaded anyway. Now the international community is warning Iran against attacking Israel. As the link above shows, those warnings contain credible threats. And Iran is... restraining itself, so far. This gives me hope that if China began serious preparations for an imminent invasion or blockade of Taiwan, the international community could come together and pressure China to hold back. The threat of crippling economic sanctions could make them think twice. At the same time, China is slowly hardening itself against hypothetical sanctions, so threats of sanctions may have little teeth in the future. With respect to Israel, the US has been working around the clock to pressure both Israel and Hamas to reach a ceasefire agreement. Could, in the event of a looming Chinese invasion or blockade of Taiwan, the US apply diplomatic pressure on _Taiwan_ to engage in peaceful reunification negotiations with China? Would it? After all, Iran is holding back for two reasons: the threats are credible, and Iran may get what it wants after all, an end to the war in Gaza, without resorting to force. If the same conditions were replicated with respect to China and Taiwan, it would mean that China would hold back if the threats were credible, and Taiwan agreed to start serious negotiations for a peaceful reunification. China under Xi is doing everything it can to nullify the credibility of future threats, be they sanctions or foreign military intervention. So if China is confident that it cannot be defeated or deterred, the only way to hold them back would be for Taiwan to more or less peacefully capitulate to a one-country-two-systems kind of deal, before hostilities begin.",
