That leaves the US at a critical disadvantage against China\u2019s numerically superior fleet.\n\n>The maintenance backlog has \u201csubstantially reduced\u201d the number of nuclear submarines operational at any given moment, cutting the \u201cforce\u2019s capacity for meeting day-to-day mission demands and potentially putting increased operational pressure\u201d on submarines that are in service, CRS naval analyst Ronald O\u2019Rourke said in a July 6 report.\n\n>That\u2019s up from 28% overall in 2017 and 33% in 2022, and below the industry best practice of 20%.\n\n>The Naval Sea Systems Command blamed \u201cplanning, material availability, and shipyard execution,\u201d according to a statement issued in response to the new statistics. The service has launched several initiatives to address these \u201cprimary maintenance delay\u201d drivers, it said. \n\n>The command gave an updated maintenance backlog status, saying that 16 of 49 subs, or 32%, were out of commission as of late June.\n\n>US defense officials and lawmakers consider the submarine force a key advantage over China\u2019s bigger navy. The inactive subs are not the nuclear ballistic missile Ohio-class submarines but fast attack boats that can fire torpedoes and Tomahawk cruise missile at vessels and land targets, and perform stealth missions such as surveillance.\n\n>The previously undisclosed backlog woes stand in contrast to current Pentagon policy that\u2019s called for increased visibility worldwide for the US sub force as a message to China, Russia and North Korea. The US has occasionally showcased its submarines in the past, but the pace picked up in the last year with publicized port visits in the Arabian Sea, at Diego Garcia, at Gibraltar and in the Atlantic.  \n\n>The most recent was a June appearance by the guided-missile submarine USS Michigan in Busan, South Korea.\n\n>One current example of the extreme backlog is the USS Connecticut, one of three premier Seawolf-class submarines.

A significant portion of the active duty maneuver units are either slotted for one of those deployments, there now, or coming back. On top of that we have brigade sized deployments to Kosovo, Africa, and Ukraine. The Army tries to free up active duty units from those deployments involving training so they can prepare for actual combat, which is a totally different train up. Training deployment trainups are actually pretty short, I think it's only two months long (which is barely enough time to get the fat bodies into decent shape). In comparison, it's a minimum of six months of unit training for a deployment expecting to see combat.\n\nFrom what my buddies who are in my old Army National Guard units tell me, who are still in, the policy is that every Guard unit deploys overseas once every five years. DOD got in the habit of activating them with Title 10 during the GWOT, there hasn't been any state governor mass protest, so they can still do it as long as recruitment/retention doesn't go to shit. It has, badly, but so has active duty. And it's not like anybody is going to say \"No, we can't do it\" to Biden or anyone else, that's the best way to get retired on the spot with their replacement saying \"Can do! Outstanding idea, sir!\"\n\nDefinitely incompetent. I'm still mentally traumatized by my 3.5 years in the Guard. Especially leadership, wholly shit. I've come to terms though, the modem job is too hard, it's basically impossible to learn it one weekend a month and two weeks a year.

Here is a thread with everything you need to know about the implications:\n\nFirst, and most importantly, numbers: I estimate that France currently has a stockpile of 440-460 SCALP-EG missiles. France has procured approximately 500 missiles over the last two decades, but also used them repeatedly, most recently against  Syrian chemical weapons facilities in 2018.\n\nIt is unclear what part of France\u2019s SCALP-EG stockpile is currently operational. Of Germany\u2019s Taurus stockpile only 150 of 600 are reported operational, for example. It is likely that a larger share of France\u2019s SCALP-EG arsenal is currently operational.\n\nA conservative estimate is that France will donate at least 10-20% of its SCALP-EG stockpile to Ukraine. This would provide Ukraine with some 45-90 additional long-range strike weapons. It is possible that France donates more, but this depends on French contingency planning.\n\nIn terms of capability, SCALP-EG is very similar to Storm Shadow, given that the two were developed jointly in the late 1990s. Minor discrepancies may still exist, for example in terms of the warhead and guidance systems. The overall capability profile is the same, however.\n\nSCALP-EG is equipped with a 450 kg multi-effect warhead that combines a primary shaped charge and a secondary follow-on warhead in the form of a penetrator. SCALP-EG is guided by a mix of midcourse and terminal guidance systems that provide the missile with pinpoint accuracy.\n\nDifferent versions of SCALP-EG exist with different range ceilings (300-550 km). Ukraine will likely receive a SCALP-EG variant at the lower end of the range spectrum. It is also possible that Ukraine has promised not to use SCALP-EG against targets outside Ukraine.\n\nAs such, SCALP-EG, similar to Storm Shadow, maximizes damage against high-value pinpoint targets, including hardened and buried ones. This being said, SCALP-EG is also highly effective against softer targets, such as warehouses or troop bases.\n\nWhat\u2019s the crucial part of the story: Right now it\u2019s all about numbers. The UK can only provide Ukraine with a limited number of Storm Shadow cruise missiles. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important that additional countries provide long-range strike weapons to Ukraine.\n\nFrance stepping up is therefore a significant development. Ukraine will hope that this entices other states to follow suit, most notably the United States in regard to ATACMS. ATACMS would complement Ukraine\u2019s capability profile very well.\n\nGiven that both France and the UK are now delivering long-range strike weapons to Ukraine, the air around Germany gets thinner. Pressure has been building up over the last two months to follow suit and to deliver Taurus cruise missiles to Ukraine. \n\nLet\u2019s hope Germany will clear the delivery soon. However, it is likely that Germany will not move before the United States has made a decision.\"",

            "body": "This is about the planned Leopard 2 repair hub in Poland, financed by Germany. Translation via DeepL:\n\n>**Federal government apparently dissolves deal for tank workshop in Poland**  \n>  \n>The German government is pulling out of the agreement with Poland to repair Ukrainian Leopard tanks on Polish territory. This was reported to the Handelsblatt by persons familiar with the matter. The reason for this is apparently the Poles' price expectations, which are completely exaggerated from the German point of view.  \n>  \n>The Federal Ministry of Defence officially said that the final decision had not yet been made and that talks with the Polish side were still ongoing.  \n>  \n>\"Poland and Germany are still pursuing the idea of refurbishing Leopard 2 tanks,\" a spokesperson said. They want to coordinate this together, he added.  \n>  \n>Ukraine urgently needs a way to make damaged Western-designed battle tanks fit for action again. In their ongoing counter-offensive, the Ukrainian armed forces are suffering heavy losses. In March, after a long period of hesitation, the German government handed over 18 modern Leopard 2 tanks of the type A6 to Ukraine. Other European partners also promised deliveries, including Poland. But there is also a dispute over the Leopard A4 tanks provided by Poland: of the 14 vehicles delivered, eight arrived damaged in Ukraine, as Handelsblatt has learned.  \n>  \n>The aim of the planned repair centre was to maintain Leopard tanks as close as possible to the border with Ukraine in order to have short distances. Already in April, Defence Minister Boris Pistorius (SPD) had signed a memorandum of understanding with his counterpart for the construction of the tank repair centre.The centre is to be built jointly by the German defence companies Rheinmetall and Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW) and the Polish company PGZ. According to informed circles, however, PGZ is said to have demanded prices that are ten times higher than usual.Pistorius had recently increased the pressure at a meeting with his Polish counterpart Mariusz Blaszczak. The negotiations should be concluded \"within the next ten days, if possible, so that we know which direction to take,\" Pistorius said.According to the German Defence Ministry, Leopard 2 A5 and Leopard 2 A6 tanks are to be repaired in Germany and probably also in Lithuania.The repair work on these models could begin now, \"as soon as the Ukrainian armed forces indicate the need for repair\". Negotiations on the repair of Leopard 2A4 main battle tanks are still ongoing.  \n>  \n>**Many Ukrainian Leopard tanks damaged**  \n>  \n>Ukraine is dependent on combat-capable Leopard tanks, as these are needed for the reconquest of the Russian-occupied territories in the south and east of the country. According to experts, about half of the Leopard tanks delivered are already damaged. Photos from the battlefield circulating on online networks show that one to two vehicles are destroyed, others are in need of repair.  \n>  \n>Each Leopard 2 usually requires several hundred hours of work. At normal market prices, the German government has to reckon with an amount in the three-digit millions for the repair shop. In Poland, however, these costs would have been considerably higher, a person familiar with the events told the Handelsblatt.  \n>  \n>The main battle tanks could now alternatively be overhauled in Ukraine itself. For this purpose, the Germans would cooperate with the Ukrainian defence company Ukroboronprom. The state-owned company, which employs more than 60,000 people, maintains several sites in the west of the country that have so far been protected from Russian air attacks. Rheinmetall has already signed contracts with Ukroboronprom for the maintenance and production of tanks.  \n>  \n>While the cooperation with Poland is stalling, the cooperation with Romania is underway. In this country, Marder infantry fighting vehicles are to be overhauled. There are no difficulties with the project, they say.  \n>  \n>In the spring, however, there was a dispute with Slovakia, where, among other things, howitzers for the Ukraine were to be serviced.

Translation via DeepL:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Federal government apparently dissolves deal for tank workshop in Poland</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>The German government is pulling out of the agreement with Poland to repair Ukrainian Leopard tanks on Polish territory. This was reported to the Handelsblatt by persons familiar with the matter. The reason for this is apparently the Poles&#39; price expectations, which are completely exaggerated from the German point of view.  </p>\n\n<p>The Federal Ministry of Defence officially said that the final decision had not yet been made and that talks with the Polish side were still ongoing.  </p>\n\n<p>&quot;Poland and Germany are still pursuing the idea of refurbishing Leopard 2 tanks,&quot; a spokesperson said. They want to coordinate this together, he added.  </p>\n\n<p>Ukraine urgently needs a way to make damaged Western-designed battle tanks fit for action again. In their ongoing counter-offensive, the Ukrainian armed forces are suffering heavy losses. In March, after a long period of hesitation, the German government handed over 18 modern Leopard 2 tanks of the type A6 to Ukraine. Other European partners also promised deliveries, including Poland. But there is also a dispute over the Leopard A4 tanks provided by Poland: of the 14 vehicles delivered, eight arrived damaged in Ukraine, as Handelsblatt has learned.  </p>\n\n<p>The aim of the planned repair centre was to maintain Leopard tanks as close as possible to the border with Ukraine in order to have short distances. Already in April, Defence Minister Boris Pistorius (SPD) had signed a memorandum of understanding with his counterpart for the construction of the tank repair centre.The centre is to be built jointly by the German defence companies Rheinmetall and Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW) and the Polish company PGZ. According to informed circles, however, PGZ is said to have demanded prices that are ten times higher than usual.Pistorius had recently increased the pressure at a meeting with his Polish counterpart Mariusz Blaszczak. The negotiations should be concluded &quot;within the next ten days, if possible, so that we know which direction to take,&quot; Pistorius said.According to the German Defence Ministry, Leopard 2 A5 and Leopard 2 A6 tanks are to be repaired in Germany and probably also in Lithuania.The repair work on these models could begin now, &quot;as soon as the Ukrainian armed forces indicate the need for repair&quot;. Negotiations on the repair of Leopard 2A4 main battle tanks are still ongoing.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Many Ukrainian Leopard tanks damaged</strong>  </p>\n\n<p>Ukraine is dependent on combat-capable Leopard tanks, as these are needed for the reconquest of the Russian-occupied territories in the south and east of the country. According to experts, about half of the Leopard tanks delivered are already damaged. Photos from the battlefield circulating on online networks show that one to two vehicles are destroyed, others are in need of repair.  </p>\n\n<p>Each Leopard 2 usually requires several hundred hours of work. At normal market prices, the German government has to reckon with an amount in the three-digit millions for the repair shop. In Poland, however, these costs would have been considerably higher, a person familiar with the events told the Handelsblatt.  </p>\n\n<p>The main battle tanks could now alternatively be overhauled in Ukraine itself. For this purpose, the Germans would cooperate with the Ukrainian defence company Ukroboronprom. The state-owned company, which employs more than 60,000 people, maintains several sites in the west of the country that have so far been protected from Russian air attacks. Rheinmetall has already signed contracts with Ukroboronprom for the maintenance and production of tanks.  </p>\n\n<p>While the cooperation with Poland is stalling, the cooperation with Romania is underway. In this country, Marder infantry fighting vehicles are to be overhauled. There are no difficulties with the project, they say.  </p>\n\n<p>In the spring, however, there was a dispute with Slovakia, where, among other things, howitzers for the Ukraine were to be serviced. The Slovakian customs authorities demanded high customs duties for spare parts, which led to a conflict with Berlin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

In the past, there were many Rus, Kiev, Pskov, Novgorod, Moscow... The bel in Belarus means white, but refers to geography, meaning \"West\".

Or talks about a brotherly war, of Slavs killing Slavs... It's something quite different from Russian state imperialism/Putinism or great Russian chauvinism, but more like Pan-Germans or better Pan-Europeans in the past, wanting to avoid conflict.\n\nWhen one rejects the ecumene (like those Ukrainians who want to cut all cultural ties) it seems like traitorism to cosmopolitanism, embracing regionalism, shared humanity etc. From one perspective, this can sound and even be bad.

In\nthe early weeks of the war, the official said, Mr. Zelensky would sign\noff calls with Mr. Biden by saying, \u201cThis may be the last time I see\nyou.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>But Biden officials privately appealed to Mr. Zelensky\u2019s team to\nhandle the phone calls differently. The situation improved once\nBridget A. Brink, the new American ambassador, arrived last spring.\nAnd Mr. Biden has often given in to Mr. Zelensky, eventually agreeing\nto send HIMARS guided rocket launchers, a Patriot antimissile battery\nand M1 Abrams tanks, all of which he initially withheld.</p>\n\n<p>The relationship has grown stronger in recent months. Mr. Zelensky\u2019s\nsplashy visit to Washington just before Christmas seemed to make an\nimpression on Mr. Biden and his national security adviser, Jake\nSullivan, who calls himself the quartermaster of the Ukraine war and\nworks closely with Andriy Yermak, Mr. Zelensky\u2019s top adviser. And Mr.\nBiden\u2019s return trip to Kyiv highlighted their solidarity as Mr.\nZelensky thanked him profusely for help that will be \u201cremembered\neternally,\u201d while pressing for additional weapons more gently.&quot;</p>\n</div>",

Zelensky is right to press for better, stronger guarantees delivered sooner, it's literally his job to do it, but I think it's the best realistic outcome, and I also think everyone, including Zelensky's staff, know it.\n\nIf NATO had given a specific deadline, say, July 11th next year, then all Putin would have to do is keep the war going until July 11th next year. It's not like UAF is going to march on Moscow, not next year, not in ten years. Then, on July 11th, either the Kremlin's ridiculous \"we're actually at war with NATO\" bullshit suddenly becomes real, and gives Putin a real tool to enact full mobilisation, or NATO postpones Ukraine's admission, at which point every security guarantee NATO ever offered to a non-NATO country evaporates.\n\nIf NATO had announced that Ukraine would become a NATO member as soon as the war ends, Russia would be in a similar position to quasi-unilaterally determine Ukraine's membership, and the outcome for Russia - NATO relationship. For instance, if Russia announces an unilateral ceasefire, does that count as an end to the war? If it does, we're back to square 1, and any breach of the ceasfire brings Russia at war to NATO. If it doesn't, haggling over the definition of \"and end to the war\" will similarly paint NATO in a bad corner, as an organization that does not fulfill its promises.\n\nBesides, two years into a war that Russia has committed not to start through several treaties, and which its government has repeatedly declared it won't even as late as a few days before it, it's already abundantly clear that a treaty with Russia isn't worth the ink it's signed with. \"The conditions\" to be met should therefore, IMHO, be read in terms of \"when Russia can no longer credibly interfere with NATO and Ukraine's decision\", the way it couldn't credibly interfere with NATO and Sweden's decision, or NATO and Finland's. Defining the exact details of this state publicly is obviously a diplomatic faux pas, and more importantly, with Russia being in the volatile situation it's in, it's probably too early to do it anyway.\n\nThis isn't the first time we've been here. Eighty years ago, George Kennan notoriously, though in an oversimplifying manner, perhaps, observed that the Soviet leadership was just the latest in a long line of imperial governments in Moscow that had used a real or imaginary external threat to consolidate its position and mobilize its population. It's a powerful tool and I think NATO strategists are right to deny it to Putin.\n\nInstead, this particularly ambiguous choice -- \"when the moment is right\", without any indication if that's before or after the conclusion of the war, or under what circumstances -- leaves the Russian government with no obvious deadline for how long they need to keep things going, and what kind of ultimate state of affairs they need to reach if they want to deny NATO membership to Ukraine, or what conditions they need to negotiate.\n\nIt also leaves Ukraine without definitive formal guarantees, to be sure, which is obviously a bad situation to be in -- NATO countries can always walk back on their commitment and deem \"the conditions\" unmet forever. So this is not a good long-term outcome. But I do think it's a better *short-*term strategy and, given that Ukraine is currently fighting for its existence as a free country, it may be the correct trade-off.",

It&#39;s a powerful tool and I think NATO strategists are right to deny it to Putin.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, this particularly ambiguous choice -- &quot;when the moment is right&quot;, without any indication if that&#39;s before or after the conclusion of the war, or under what circumstances -- leaves the Russian government with no obvious deadline for how long they need to keep things going, and what kind of ultimate state of affairs they need to reach if they want to deny NATO membership to Ukraine, or what conditions they need to negotiate.</p>\n\n<p>It also leaves Ukraine without definitive formal guarantees, to be sure, which is obviously a bad situation to be in -- NATO countries can always walk back on their commitment and deem &quot;the conditions&quot; unmet forever. So this is not a good long-term outcome. But I do think it&#39;s a better <em>short-</em>term strategy and, given that Ukraine is currently fighting for its existence as a free country, it may be the correct trade-off.</p>\n</div>",

No one that (militarily) matters within the alliance will obviously commit to this. Ukraine obviously needs security guarantees after war, but these will be subject to negotiations and there was no chance in hell that was coming out of this summit.\n\nNATO/West on the other hand is full of supportive rhetoric, but they are also unsure about how this conflict ends and nobody wants to give Ukraine security guarantees when psychotic Russia controls who knows how much of the territory of Ukraine and \"proper\" peace seems very unlikely at this point. NATO doesn't actually want to fight Russia at all as long as they can avoid it, there's zero appetite for war and in true Western fashion, nobody wants to rock the boat too much so expecting resolute decisions is basically out of the question, especially when unanimity is needed.\n\nI also think Zelensky is reaching a limit on where his demands will get him. Threats to skip the summit, or voicing his disappointment with the result will not actually bring any support towards the goal, quite contrary really.

Is the UAF getting this intelligence from nato or is it their own intelligence? Why has Russia not been able to have similar success despite firing thousands of missiles?

Doctrinally there are differences in militaries but I'm just curious what people think this situation demands. If the UAF gets 50 or so SCALP and you were in charge, would you shoot them all in quick succession before the Russians can adjust or do it only as the juiciest opportunities come up?",

                "body": "> The strike was widely reported in Ukraine and the West as targeting the city centre and killing civilians.\n\nYes, because it was targetting the city center and killed civilians. \n\nThe last death in August brings the total to 28 dead - three of which are children including [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/vyvj6f/the_last_instagram_story_of_the_girl_who_died/). You can find a list of names/photos/info of 19/24 of the deaths [here](https://babel.ua/en/texts/81586-four-days-ago-russian-rockets-killed-24-people-in-vinnytsia-among-them-are-children-students-a-sound-engineer-a-teacher-a-retired-woman-and-a-volunteer-here-are-the-names-surnames-and-short-stories-of) which consist of teachers, shop workers, clinic workers (yeah, a medical clinic burned down in this attack as well) and other non-military personel. This list was from a few days after the attack and so does not include everyone who died later.\n\nWhat I think you're referring to: Mediazona compiled a list of three officers who were allegedly killed from these strikes (link in Wiki). If this is the correct source, your memory is a bit off. First, it was three officers and not four. Also, it was not found through 'obituaries in newspapers' but rather by social media/news posts that don't seem to be trying to hide the fact. I don't doubt the veracity of Mediazona, **one of these names is mentioned on the article I linked above**. But even so, they're a bit lazy on this one as 1 of the 3 officers connection, \"did not specify the place of death, but from the date of publication it can be concluded that his father died in Vinnitsa.\" So if Mediazona is only basing this off him dying July 14, with no indication otherwise, I'm not sure I trust that fully though they have a decent track record.\n\nAlso: regarding the Russian narrative of targetting a facility, \"hosting a conference of the Ukrainian Armed Forces command with representatives of foreign arms suppliers\" is an interesting one. On one hand, it appears they did kill some members of the air force with notable rank. On the other hand, the \"House of Officers\" which was allegedly holding this conference is used as a cultural center [that was a hosting a concert later that day](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/vyv5m2/russian_propaganda_claiming_house_of_officers/). One of the sound engineers that was setting up for that concert died from the attacks (one of the 19 posted in my link above). It's not too much of a coincidence officers of the air force would be in this city as this is their headquarters. From everything gathered, Russia could have only killed up to 5 people from this \"conference\" out of the 28 total deaths (and that's assuming all unknowns are linked to it) - managing to kill more people outside the building... great work.\n\n>We actually don't know how many similar cases were covered up or never reported in the first place.\n\nThere's about as much uncertainty for **both sides** in this conflict, I would argue. Most recorded losses from both sides are not publicly posted by the governments or state media but are rather scrapped from social media and news outlets. This is how the Mediazona article reference above discovered the Ukrainian officers. People from both sides mourn deaths, and both sides have people working around the clock to capture and document these losses. There is nothing to indicate one side does this more or less than the other. As you document link below, Russia knows plenty about Ukrainian officer deaths.\n\nThe example you posted above to show Ukraine hiding these losses is also flawed. When 20+ civilians, including kids, die from a Russian attack, do you think they're not going to focus on those stories to get international attention? Of course; the retiree and teachers who die will be pushed aside just as well as the 40 year old officer.",

But if you were wondering why the hell HHH goes from following Rothbard down to the UNLV Business School to the LVMI in Auburn Alabama to suddenly running the Property and Freedom Society out of a hotel in the swankiest resort town in Turkey...well, here's your answer I think. Bigger players took an interest in bankrolling these weirdos harder...\n\nBut the fact that it's not just that the Trump campaign was tailor made to steal the Paul voter base, https://np.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/3odfhh/urandpaulsbrilloballs_gives_a_great_write_up_on/cvwno4n/ but also that it consists of many of the same connected people who all go to the same annual party in Turkey along with some suspiciously connected Russians that tie into a current administration scandal...\n\n...\n\nPeople quickly forget https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Red_Dog was a real thing. Some of these same characters actually took foreign money and tried to commit treason and overthrow a foreign government (Dominica) before. Not that long ago http://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/07/us/no-headline-147552.html?pagewanted=all Funny thing is, it was a mostly black country and the war would be fought by some killer hotep rastas living in the hills, but they weren't invading Dominica to make it white paradise. The idea was to invade to get casinos and drug dealing operations going to fund their political aspirations in the US, Canada, and Europe.\n\nAnd don't forget...Ron Paul was named in the Grand Jury depo for his role in the Bayou of Pigs, https://books.google.com/books?id=K9PLy77W3KUC&pg=PA120&lpg=PA120&dq=bayou+of+pigs+%22ron+paul%22&source=bl&ots=AnpkYafTwS&sig=q7gGNbW6lbuAq_kIGbdpQm_m2ek&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj6oobjx9XSAhWEJiYKHZizBGoQ6AEISTAI#v=onepage&q=bayou%20of%20pigs%20%22ron%20paul%22&f=false the Good Ol' Boy judge just chose never to charge or interview him and to lightly toss the book at Don Black instead...and it turns out they were receiving money from South Africa and Libya back in the 80s. Why not Russia and Turkey today?\n\nOddly, it's possible that the Mises-Dominica links don't end there either. When Ulbrecht resurrected himself as Dread Pirate Roberts and got caught for running Silk Road, him and his hundreds of thousands of bitcoins tried to skitter off to where? Dominica again. First country to give bitcoin to all citizens and adopt it?

Pepe http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2001/02/floridas-fanjuls-200102 is the Domino Sugar king--a billionaire, probably the only richer guy than Trump in West Palm Beach, and on of Trump's biggest donors. http://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/10/3/1576536/-The-Real-Pepe-Wealthy-Donald-Trump-and-Marco-Rubio-Fundraiser-s-Assistant-Attends-KKK-Gathering And let's not forget how bizarre and political Pepe is. https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/05/menendez-scandal-has-gotten-so-weird/315146/\n\nAnyways, it's one tight-knit little world, the far right in the US. It's pretty easy to follow the characters and figure out when they're up to something...\n\nhow many people can you hang out with when you're an avowed super racist? Like is it really that weird that David Duke, former head of the KKK, had a wife who left him for Don Black, newer head of the KKK? Probably not really. Chloe is definitely a KKK queen. Is it weirder that she works for as the personal assistant for a right wing Cuban billionaire in Florida? Yeah. That part's a little more confusing.\n\nBut whatever. The fact these people run in the same ciricles isn't really evidence of anything. The only thing that really makes it surprising is that they are white supremacists after all--so when they marry or hang around with Turks and Cubans and whomever--it makes you wonder what the fuck is going on. Especially a German who wrote so many long screeds about how the Turks are ruining Germany marrying a Turk. WTF is that?\n\nAnd then there is the attitude change in the writing. Somehow, 10 years ago, Putin was a statist devil to a lot of these guys. Then he becomes a hero. All of the sudden, Turks love Trump. And Russia and Turkey, who hand't been getting along, are all buddy buddy. The travel ban between the two was rescinded. Trade reopened. The whole thing.

But the Turks did and do pay to fly all those white nationalists out to Turkey every year, just like the Russians did and do the same. And both governments did drop piles of money on former General Flynn--and had contracts and meetings with him he hid, didn't fully disclose, or lied about.

            "body": "Von Mises set up an institute in Minsk in that horrible dictatorship of Belarus. So Jaroslav Romanchuk runs that. Among other things, Romanchuk translated Atlas Shrugged into Russian and was the mentor of Andrei Illarionov, Putin's former chief economic advisor, but who is currently on the Koch Brothers Payroll in DC at the Center for Global Liberty and Prosperity of the Cato Institute.\n\nAndrei Illarionov had one other mentor, Dmitry Kostygin, billionaire oligarch who runs the Russian Amazon clone Ulmart.\n\nThis crop is totally different from the old Anti-Communist Gorbechev era Russians like Yuri N. Maltsev who used to hang around the Von Mises institute. Those guys hate Putin. This new group is very pro-Putin.\n\nSo you can watch how 10 years ago LVMI and Lew Rockwell https://www.lewrockwell.com/2006/10/yuri-n-maltsev/happy-birthday-mr-putin/ were all super anti-Putin and siding with Mikhail Khodorkovsky. And then, something changes around 2014. Check it out. https://www.lewrockwell.com/2014/06/paul-craig-roberts/is-putin-trying-to-save-the-world-from-war/ They really start laying it on thick. https://www.lewrockwell.com/2015/10/eric-margolis/can-putin-checkmate-the-empire/ I mean seriously. https://www.lewrockwell.com/2015/05/no_author/putin-is-telling-the-truth/ I mean, they were literally calling him \"Comrade Putin\" https://www.lewrockwell.com/2006/05/sabine-barnhart/hausfraunomics/ not so long ago...\n\nIn fact, the last surviving founder of LVMI, Lew Rockwell himself, was on Russia Today just this week talking about how Sessions is innocent. https://straightlinelogic.com/2017/03/04/sessions-scandal-us-heading-to-constitutional-crisis-by-lew-rockwell/ Here's a transcript someone posted.\n\nOf course, Russia has been making it a point to bring the worldwide alt-right together and foster it. They pay to fly these people over and have meetings. https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/23/world/europe/right-wing-groups-find-a-haven-for-a-day-in-russia.html?_r=1 So this is how Farage meets Le Pen meets Spencer meets Sessions meets Hoppe etc. Here's another article. https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/03/world/americas/alt-right-vladimir-putin.html Same characters.\n\nIn fact, we know the League of the South is located in physical proximity to the LVMI.

                "body": "\n\nEkim Alptekin did pay Flynn $530,000 to lobby the Trump admin on Turkey's behalf. That came out a week ago, and it is just fact. Nobody disputes it. Trump had already fired Flynn, and said it was the first he learned of it. Flynn had already been caught and fired for lying to Pence, but came out and told the truth in the end. Even Ekim put it up on his Twitter, although he is making the argument that he would have paid Podesta if he wanted influence in the Whitehouse, not Flynn, and that he funneled that Turkish govenrment money through Inovo to Flynn for some other reason.\n\nSo is that the Turkish government paying Flynn to act on their behalf? Yes. 100%. Does that prove the goal is to destabilize the US or that they were working in concert with the Russians? No. That part I am not certain of.\n\nBut does K. Ekim Alptekin belong to a common board and a common organization as V. Ergin Imre? Certainly. Is V. Ergin Imre one of the wealthiest men in Turkey with extensive business interests in Russia. Also proven yes. Is he also the brother-in-law of Hans Hermann Hoppe? Also proven yes. Has Hoppe suddenly for the past few years had ample funding to fly alt right characters to have one big party in Turkey in a hotel owned by V. Ergin Imre where he busses in everything from hired women to martini waterfalls and DJs? Yup. Undeniable. Is Richard Spencer repeatedly a guest at these things? Yes. Is Peter Thiel also a guest at these things? Yes. So are a lot of people. Whatever. It is a conference, even if a weird one. So I can prove all those connections exist. The marriages, the money, the people meeting together, the active merger of anarcho-capitalists and white nationalists. What I cannot prove is that the money actively comes from the Turkish government, nor can I prove that is being used for the purposes of destabilizing the US.\n\nBut I can prove that the Russian government funds the anti-global initiative and Dugin's Eurasian and Identitarian Movements. And I can prove that Dugin has 47 physical Eurasian Movement locations, and that they are only located in Russia, Poland and Turkey. And I can prove that Richard Spencer calls himself an Identitarian. And I can prove that he and other identitarians attend Hoppe's Turkey meeting. And I can prove that he and other Identitiarians attend similar meetings in Moscow that are funded by the Kremlin. Can I definitively prove why the Kremlin is funding these people? No, I can't. Not any more than I can definitively prove why they give money to Marine Le Pen or the P-IRA or the Catalan Independence or Calexit guys. But they do. And it's documented. So they are up to something. Am I 100% sure the goal is to destabilize the US and EU? Like I said, no.\n\n...\n\nIn 2013 Dugin's movement took part in annual Kremlin's youth meetings where one could see Donetsk People Republic representatives, at that time - just a bunch of young freaks from Donetsk nobody ever heard about, but they already had a flag which is official DPR flag now: http://i.imgur.com/PabFDi2.jpg\n\nIt was one of scenarios prepared by Kremlin since 2005 (first Ukranian pro-West anti-Russian coup). And when the moment came, Putin used that scenario. Dugin had always been partly responsible/executive for it. He also has some ties with Turkey which could help resolve that conflict between Russia and Turkey, but it still has nothing to do with Dugin as a mastermind though. Dugin is a sincere idealist. And his ideals are Eurasinism and Russian World form Far East to the center of Europe (which sounds like Pinky and Brain's level of thinking).\n\n...\n\nWhat I'm finding points specifically to one think tank, the Ludwig von Mises Institute, and more specifically to a couple of members there, namely Hans Hermann Hoppe and Paul Gottfried.\n\nIf Hoppe wants to disassociate himself and anarcho-capitalism from the Alt-Right, he probably should stop inviting alt-right leaders to parties and boat-rides he hosts in Turkey. Hoppe's keynote speech at the Property and Freedom Society last fall was literally titled \"Libertarianism and the \u201cAlt-Right\u201d.\" I'm not making this stuff up. He is.\n\nhttp://propertyandfreedom.org/\n\nIt's actually not just far-right groups I find evidence of Russia and Turkey supporting. In the USA it is primarily far-right groups. But even in the US there are also left-groups like Calexit, which Russia seems to pay to help promote in very much the same way. And in Spain and Ireland, they actually fund some socialist separatist groups. Again, I hypothesize that their goal is to destabilize the US and the EU enough that they can expand their local influence. But my point is, the lefties on Calexit hate me for this just as much as you do. Go ahead and try to tell them that their movement is being led by a dude in Moscow and funded by fascist groups in Russia, including one called \"Fuck the USA!\" They just don't want to hear it. But it's true.\n\nhttp://www.snopes.com/2017/01/30/calexit-campaign-supported-russia/\n\nWho knew Hans Hermann Hoppe married a Turk, moved to Turkey, and became brother-in-law with a guy who sits on a board with the guy who funneled $530,000 through a Dutch consulting firm to General Flynn to advance the Turkish Government's interests in the Trump Administration? Until the article broke last week, even Trump supposedly didn't know Flynn got that money. So this is brand new. And Flynn, remember, just got fired for lying about ties to Russia.\n\nhttps://www.google.com/search?client=opera&q=flynn+530000&sourceid=opera&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8\n\nAnd who ties Turkey and Russia together recently? Dugin...the man who claims he saved the regime from the coup by tipping off President Erdogan. I mean, the Chicago Tribune pieced at least that part together.\n\nhttp://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-dugin-trump-putin-turkey-20170203-story.html\n\nBut they didn't seem to grasp that Dugin's English translator is Richard Spencer's Russian Wife.

                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Ekim Alptekin did pay Flynn $530,000 to lobby the Trump admin on Turkey&#39;s behalf. That came out a week ago, and it is just fact. Nobody disputes it. Trump had already fired Flynn, and said it was the first he learned of it. Flynn had already been caught and fired for lying to Pence, but came out and told the truth in the end. Even Ekim put it up on his Twitter, although he is making the argument that he would have paid Podesta if he wanted influence in the Whitehouse, not Flynn, and that he funneled that Turkish govenrment money through Inovo to Flynn for some other reason.</p>\n\n<p>So is that the Turkish government paying Flynn to act on their behalf? Yes. 100%. Does that prove the goal is to destabilize the US or that they were working in concert with the Russians? No. That part I am not certain of.</p>\n\n<p>But does K. Ekim Alptekin belong to a common board and a common organization as V. Ergin Imre? Certainly. Is V. Ergin Imre one of the wealthiest men in Turkey with extensive business interests in Russia. Also proven yes. Is he also the brother-in-law of Hans Hermann Hoppe? Also proven yes. Has Hoppe suddenly for the past few years had ample funding to fly alt right characters to have one big party in Turkey in a hotel owned by V. Ergin Imre where he busses in everything from hired women to martini waterfalls and DJs? Yup. Undeniable. Is Richard Spencer repeatedly a guest at these things? Yes. Is Peter Thiel also a guest at these things? Yes. So are a lot of people. Whatever. It is a conference, even if a weird one. So I can prove all those connections exist. The marriages, the money, the people meeting together, the active merger of anarcho-capitalists and white nationalists. What I cannot prove is that the money actively comes from the Turkish government, nor can I prove that is being used for the purposes of destabilizing the US.</p>\n\n<p>But I can prove that the Russian government funds the anti-global initiative and Dugin&#39;s Eurasian and Identitarian Movements. And I can prove that Dugin has 47 physical Eurasian Movement locations, and that they are only located in Russia, Poland and Turkey. And I can prove that Richard Spencer calls himself an Identitarian. And I can prove that he and other identitarians attend Hoppe&#39;s Turkey meeting. And I can prove that he and other Identitiarians attend similar meetings in Moscow that are funded by the Kremlin. Can I definitively prove why the Kremlin is funding these people? No, I can&#39;t. Not any more than I can definitively prove why they give money to Marine Le Pen or the P-IRA or the Catalan Independence or Calexit guys. But they do. And it&#39;s documented. So they are up to something. Am I 100% sure the goal is to destabilize the US and EU? Like I said, no.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>In 2013 Dugin&#39;s movement took part in annual Kremlin&#39;s youth meetings where one could see Donetsk People Republic representatives, at that time - just a bunch of young freaks from Donetsk nobody ever heard about, but they already had a flag which is official DPR flag now: <a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/PabFDi2.jpg\">http://i.imgur.com/PabFDi2.jpg</a></p>\n\n<p>It was one of scenarios prepared by Kremlin since 2005 (first Ukranian pro-West anti-Russian coup). And when the moment came, Putin used that scenario. Dugin had always been partly responsible/executive for it. He also has some ties with Turkey which could help resolve that conflict between Russia and Turkey, but it still has nothing to do with Dugin as a mastermind though. Dugin is a sincere idealist. And his ideals are Eurasinism and Russian World form Far East to the center of Europe (which sounds like Pinky and Brain&#39;s level of thinking).</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>What I&#39;m finding points specifically to one think tank, the Ludwig von Mises Institute, and more specifically to a couple of members there, namely Hans Hermann Hoppe and Paul Gottfried.</p>\n\n<p>If Hoppe wants to disassociate himself and anarcho-capitalism from the Alt-Right, he probably should stop inviting alt-right leaders to parties and boat-rides he hosts in Turkey. Hoppe&#39;s keynote speech at the Property and Freedom Society last fall was literally titled &quot;Libertarianism and the \u201cAlt-Right\u201d.&quot; I&#39;m not making this stuff up. He is.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://propertyandfreedom.org/\">http://propertyandfreedom.org/</a></p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s actually not just far-right groups I find evidence of Russia and Turkey supporting. In the USA it is primarily far-right groups. But even in the US there are also left-groups like Calexit, which Russia seems to pay to help promote in very much the same way. And in Spain and Ireland, they actually fund some socialist separatist groups. Again, I hypothesize that their goal is to destabilize the US and the EU enough that they can expand their local influence. But my point is, the lefties on Calexit hate me for this just as much as you do. Go ahead and try to tell them that their movement is being led by a dude in Moscow and funded by fascist groups in Russia, including one called &quot;Fuck the USA!&quot; They just don&#39;t want to hear it. But it&#39;s true.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/2017/01/30/calexit-campaign-supported-russia/\">http://www.snopes.com/2017/01/30/calexit-campaign-supported-russia/</a></p>\n\n<p>Who knew Hans Hermann Hoppe married a Turk, moved to Turkey, and became brother-in-law with a guy who sits on a board with the guy who funneled $530,000 through a Dutch consulting firm to General Flynn to advance the Turkish Government&#39;s interests in the Trump Administration? Until the article broke last week, even Trump supposedly didn&#39;t know Flynn got that money. So this is brand new. And Flynn, remember, just got fired for lying about ties to Russia.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?client=opera&amp;q=flynn+530000&amp;sourceid=opera&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8\">https://www.google.com/search?client=opera&amp;q=flynn+530000&amp;sourceid=opera&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8</a></p>\n\n<p>And who ties Turkey and Russia together recently? Dugin...the man who claims he saved the regime from the coup by tipping off President Erdogan. I mean, the Chicago Tribune pieced at least that part together.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-dugin-trump-putin-turkey-20170203-story.html\">http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-dugin-trump-putin-turkey-20170203-story.html</a></p>\n\n<p>But they didn&#39;t seem to grasp that Dugin&#39;s English translator is Richard Spencer&#39;s Russian Wife. Nor did they seem to grasp that Spencer and Miller hung around Duke together for years...they just try to jam Bannon into that role, where maybe he fits ideologically, but there doesn&#39;t seem to be any personal connections.</p>\n\n<p>So, anyways, all I&#39;m trying to do is see the forrest through the trees and connect the dots here.

And to be honest, most of those leaders probably hear more histrionic statements from various diplomats and lobbyists every day.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/RobotWantsKitty\">u/RobotWantsKitty</a> posted an article below of Zelensky getting reprimanded by Biden. Guess what? I would bet every single thing on that list is either in the theater or on its way. That\u2019s a direct result of Ukraine\u2019s unrelenting, constant and, yes, rude demands for more assistance. People may love to hate on squeaky wheels, but the fact of the matter is that they\u2019re the ones drowning in grease wherever you look. No one\u2019s ever got rewarded for suffering in silence.</p>\n</div>",

Now, since it&#39;s NATO or bust, and since the condition is &quot;when the war is over&quot;, Putin just has to continue the war until he gets everything he wants. And he&#39;s got a big incentive, because after a peace deal is struck, if Ukraine really goes into NATO, the border won&#39;t shift again.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe the Ukrainians really thought they could retake crimea and everything...</p>\n</div>",
