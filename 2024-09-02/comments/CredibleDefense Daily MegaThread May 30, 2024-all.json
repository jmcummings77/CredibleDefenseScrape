As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

It is a war, and many are paying attention to what we say publicly. This is a line we share with many other countries.\u201d\n>\n> NATO is Divided\n> \n> On Monday, Stoltenberg asked NATO countries to reconsider the restrictions on weapon deliveries to Ukraine.\n> \n> Both the UK's David Cameron and the USA's Antony Blinken have said the same recently.\n> \n> \u201cThis is not a NATO decision, but a decision for each ally,\u201d said the Secretary General while visiting Bulgaria.\n> \n> Many countries have been skeptical about giving long-range weapons to Ukraine for fear of escalating tensions and involving Europe in the war.\n>\n> Could This Be Problematic for the Alliance?\n> \n> \u201cThis is an informal ministerial meeting.

It is a war, and many are paying attention to what we say publicly. This is a line we share with many other countries.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>NATO is Divided</p>\n\n<p>On Monday, Stoltenberg asked NATO countries to reconsider the restrictions on weapon deliveries to Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>Both the UK&#39;s David Cameron and the USA&#39;s Antony Blinken have said the same recently.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis is not a NATO decision, but a decision for each ally,\u201d said the Secretary General while visiting Bulgaria.</p>\n\n<p>Many countries have been skeptical about giving long-range weapons to Ukraine for fear of escalating tensions and involving Europe in the war.</p>\n\n<p>Could This Be Problematic for the Alliance?</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis is an informal ministerial meeting. We will not make any decisions here. But it is important to meet and discuss it. I perceive that there is increasing understanding that it must be possible for Ukraine to fight the occupying power in the most effective way for them,\u201d Eide said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

GNSS systems have parameters knows as Time To First Fix (TTFF) and Time To Subsequent Fix (TTSF), TTFF will be your upper bound on how long the system needs and TTSF is the lower bound. For something like ATACMS, reacquisition time should be much closer to the TTSF if it had a good fix prior to launch.

That isn't an escalation, it's a token gesture from the West. Russia isn't going to escalate over that, which is exactly why it's done in that manner.\n\nThere is no big conspiracy going on.

That isn&#39;t an escalation, it&#39;s a token gesture from the West. Russia isn&#39;t going to escalate over that, which is exactly why it&#39;s done in that manner.</p>\n\n<p>There is no big conspiracy going on. But please tell, what is exactly holding back the west form doing so? If they have no escalation risk at all. Everything will stay the same, except Ukraine will do better. What&#39;s time and time again stopping them?</p>\n</div>",

At least one strike in Armavir, in Russia\u2019s southeastern Krasnodar region, appeared to have caused some damage.\n> \n> \u201cThese sites have not been involved in supporting Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine,\u201d the U.S. official said. \u201cBut they are sensitive locations because Russia could perceive that its strategic deterrent capabilities are being targeted, which could undermine Russia\u2019s ability to maintain nuclear deterrence against the United States.\u201d\n> \n> A Ukrainian official familiar with the matter, however, said that Russia has used the radar sites to monitor the Ukrainian military\u2019s activities, particularly Kyiv\u2019s use of aerial weaponry, such as drones and missiles. The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive security matter, confirmed that Ukraine\u2019s Military Intelligence Directorate, known by its initials as GUR, was responsible for the strikes.  \n> \n> ...  \n> \n> The Ukrainian official said the goal of the strikes was to diminish Russia\u2019s ability to track the Ukrainian military\u2019s activities in southern Ukraine. The drone that targeted the radar station near Orsk, in Russia\u2019s Orenburg region along Kazakhstan\u2019s northern border, traveled more than 1,100 miles, making it one of the deepest attempted strikes into Russian territory. The Ukrainian official declined to say whether the strike, on May 26, caused any damage.\n> \n> U.S. officials said they are sympathetic to Ukraine\u2019s plight \u2014 administration officials are actively weighing whether to lift restraints on the use of U.S.-provided weapons to strike inside Russia. But were Russia\u2019s early-warning capabilities to be blinded by Ukrainian attacks, even in part, that could hurt strategic stability between Washington and Moscow, the U.S. official said.\n> \n> \u201cRussia could think it has a diminished ability to detect early nuclear activity against it, which then could become an issue,\u201d the official said. \u201cIt should be obvious to everyone that there\u2019s no intention whatsoever [by the United States] of using nuclear weapons against Russia. But there\u2019s certainly concern about how Russia could perceive its deterrent capabilities being targeted and early-warning systems being attacked.\u201d\n> \n> The perception issue is likely fueled by \u201can erroneous conviction that Ukraine\u2019s targeting is directed by Washington,\u201d said Dmitri Alperovitch, security analyst and chairman of Silverado think tank. \u201cBut that means attacks by Kyiv on Russian nuclear deterrence infrastructure has potential to trigger a perilous escalation with the West. At the end of the day, nuclear command and control and early-warning sites should be off-limits.''\n> \n> Some analysts were puzzled at the targets: While Krasnodar is close enough to Ukraine to track missiles and drones, the radar station near Orsk is focused on the Middle East and China, they said.\n> \n> Asked why they would target a site so far away, the Ukrainian official asserted that Russia \u201cswitched all of its capabilities for war against Ukraine.\u201d  \n\nSo this confirms the second strike.

For now, the calculus seems to fall towards escalation being too costly/not effective. That does not mean that this will always remain the case.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that it worked is a master stroke though.<br/>\n- Russia is suddenly weakened in relation to other nuclear nations, meaning that the calculus of power shifted there.<br/>\n- Ukraine is showing that it is &#39;taking off&#39; the gloves and will inflict pain on Russia outside the direct theatre of war. This fits in the escalation towards refineries earlier.  Ukrainian drones will probable keep on being used to hit unexpected and costly targets within Russia.<br/>\n- I cannot say if this influenced the decision to unleash western weapons for use on Russian soil. But coupled with the &#39;taking off&#39; of the gloves, this means that the potential cost of this war just rose for Russia.<br/>\n- It fits in the general Ukrainian strategy of destroying radar and AA systems.</p>\n</div>",

China still relies on S-400 and S-300 derived systems. The US is mass producing B-21 raiders as we speak, and NGAD is going to come online over the next few yeras. The J-20 is not particularly impressive (expert consensus says its less stealthy than an F-117). The gap in the pacific will widen, not narrow.\n\nThe entire case, that China is now a serious \"near-peer\" to the United States rests on a couple of dubious talking points:\n\n* They managed to put fins on their ballistic missile warheads, and wound up with long range hypersonic missiles. These missiles are totally interceptable by existing SM-6 missiles in the Navy's arsenal, and possibly also by Patriot missiles.\n* They released a stealth fighter of uncertain quality that isn't particularly stealthy - it just looks kind of western.\n* They lack competent bombers (and reports suggest that the H-20 program is a shitshow) and thus have compensated by building a lot of \"crutch\" short and intermediate range ballsitic missiles.\n* They built a \"large\" Navy that is mostly made up of small, useless little boats. The US Navy is still much larger by tonnage. \n\nNone of this, -none of it- indicates that they're near parity.\n\nWhat China would look like if it were actually near parity, is it would be exporting quality weapons systems to the rest of the world, and no one would have to guess at whether its a near peer, it would be obvious. Chinese kit is not highly sought after on international markets.\n\nAll of the incentives are in alignment with regard to China. The Chinese want the international clout that goes with being a military power, so they claim that they're incredibly powerful. The US media gets more clicks by parroting that. The US military gets more funding, politicians get to look serious, think tanks justify their existence etc.\n\nBut if you carefully read that report I linked - you'll find what the real expert consensus is. China handily loses a war on its doorstep in 3 to 10 days. It loses a hundred ships. It loses planes. That report assumes no bombing of the Chinese mainland. It assumes that J-20s are as good as F-22s. It doesn't model rapid dragon (they recommend keeping more B-52s in the report, which doesn't make a lot of sense post rapid dragon). It doesn't model new US hypersonics. It doesn't model the US getting 11 new bases in the Philippines. I don't think it models Russian anti-air performance in Ukraine (Chinese systems are mostly derived Russian systems). It doesn't model Typhoon land based missiles on China's doorstep.\n\nDespite all that, China suffers a humiliating defeat in that report.\n\nThere is no consensus saying that China is about to shift the balance of power. The US pacific tilt is ongoing. Next gen US systems are about to come online. The F-22 is far superior to a J-20 and is a 90's era plane. The NGAD will be an air dominance platform. The B-21 raider is a \"Stand In\" bomber according to Lloyd Austin.\n\nDon't fall for it.",
