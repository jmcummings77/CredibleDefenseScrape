As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster. Don't abuse it though! If something is not obviously against the rules but you still feel that it should be reviewed, leave a short but descriptive comment while filing the report.",

        "body": "An update on the new Russian formations. The sources are Ukrainian military observer Mashovets, Ukrainian think tank Centre for Defence Strategies, reports by Thord Are Iversen (former Norwegian officer who keeps track of the new Russian formations) and Azeri analyst Jahangir Arasli, who, thanks to his knowledge of the language, unearths many local Russian news articles about the new formations. \n\nMashovets this morning confirmed the deployment of elements of the new 25th Combined Arms Army in the Kreminna sector. The 164th Motorized Brigade would have been deployed to Zhytlivka and would be ready to enter combat around Dibrova, near the Serebrianka Forest. The 36th Motorized Regiment of the 67th Motorized Division would have been deployed in Chervonopopivka and may enter into action between Novosadove and Terny. \n\n[That's](https://nitter.net/DefMon3/status/1700151627779355108) the order of battle of the new army made by Defmon. According to what was originally announced, there should be either a second motorized division or a second motorized brigade as well, probably still being created. One of these regiments comes from Bashkortostan (which is a large pool of volunteer units afaik) and would consist of 2500 men. \n\nQuite a lot of news have been going around about the military district to which the 25th Army belongs. Initially there was talk of the Central Military District. Then instead it had been confirmed by Russian sources that it will be associated with the Eastern Military District; an article in a Russian online local newspaper (tracked down by Iversen) basically wrote that yes, it will be formed within the latter but the army will eventually be part of the Southern Military District. Another article had been published a couple of weeks ago about the deployment to the front of the Bashkortostan Regiment in an unknown sector under the responsibility of the SMD. The acting commander of the 25th Army was the former deputy commander of the 36th Army of the EMD at the start of the conflict, then he was the chief of staff of the 14th Corps of the Arctic Fleet. At least the initial phase of the training is supposed to take place in the Vladivostok region (except for the Bashkortostan Regiment which was trained in Samara) and it was reported that 10 thousand officers and contract soldiers from the Eastern Military District's armies were to be transferred to the 25th Army, which is supposed to have 30 thousand men. Tbh this leaves me skeptical, because it would considerably bring down the operational capabilities of the existing EMD formations that are already, all of them, very busy on the Southern front. It would make little sense to send an E/SMD formation to the north of Siversky Donets River, which has been the sole responsibility of the W/CMD for over a year. I wouldn't know what to think about that, even because in the ads to recruit volunteers for the 25th Army it was literally written that it would be destined for Kherson and Zaporizhzhia Oblasts. I see two possible options: the Russians changed their minds and framed it in the CMD (for Mashovets it's part of the latter district in fact); or at the moment the 25th Army would still be in an embryonic state as a stand-alone formation, with the Russians needing to hastily transfer to the front the war-ready elements of this army, under the command of a different formation. It's possible that this army could be formed in two separate stages. \n\nThe \"jurisdiction\" of the Central Military District ranges from the Svatove sector (where units of its 2nd Army are fighting between Raihorodka and Novojehorivka) to the Siversky Donets River in the Kreminna sector, where the 41st Army is deployed, supported by elements of the 98th VDV Division (in theory the 331st Regiment should still be in the area, although elements of this unit may be in Bakhmut with the rest of the division - the artillery regiment of the 98th is also deployed in Bakhmut) and until last month by the entirety of the 76th VDV Division. Also between Svatove and Kreminna there is the 20th Army of the Western MD: its 144th MRD is active just to the north of the Serebrianka Forest while the 3rd MRD is currently mainly used as a tactical/operational reserve in the Svatove sector.\n\nAt the moment the deployed elements of the 25th Army would in fact have been attached to the 41st Army, which continues to be deployed in the Kreminna sector. It's important to emphasize this because according to Budanov, sending the 25th Army into the area would have been instrumental in order to transfer the 41st Army to the Southern front. It's possible that at the moment the 25th Army still doesn't have a working general staff and is still too weak to be deployed as a stand-alone formation in a given sector and therefore needs to be framed in another army.\n\nThe 41st Army itself is not particularly competent (it can boast the crossing disaster of the Siversky Donets in May 2022), but it's pretty large compared to the average: two motorized brigades, a mountain brigade and a tank division are its maneuver formations. This army has been covering the Kreminna sector since October of the last year, when it was beaten in the battles between Lyman and Yampil. A deployment of the army to the Southern front (which has never seen the presence of CMD formations during this conflict) would be a very strange thing. It's possible that the Russians are in a situation where they have no other choice though. If the dispatch to the South is confirmed, I find it possible that they will wait for the arrival of the rest of the 25th Army and then transfer the whole Kreminna sector into their hands. The 41st Army is certainly not at 100% capacities but should still be in acceptable conditions to withstand a deployment to an area far hotter than Kreminna. The 90th Tank Division during the spring received batches of T-90Ms and T-80BVs, certainly an improvement compared to the T-72A/Bs they entered the Chernihiv Oblast with, back in February 2022.\n\nIt has to be said that the 41st Army has a history of cooperation with the VDV, particularly with the 76th Division. The deputy commander of the 41st Army, Sukhovetsky, was killed in Hostomel. Actually, the 41st Army's task was to take Chernihiv, cross the Desna River and reach Kyiv from the east. It was a resounding failure: its three brigades (35th, 55th, and 74th) were defeated in the siege of Chernihiv while the 90th Tank Division was ambushed several times on the way to Kyiv (also owing to a lack of dismounts) and was finally stopped and then pushed back in Brovary. It was the biggest debacle of the early phase of the conflict, along with the fuck-up of the 1st Tank Army between Sumy and Kharkiv. What was Sukhovetsky doing on the other side of the Dnipro? It's possible that the 41st Army was subordinate to Serdyukov and the VDV General Staff, i.e. the protagonists of the plan to seize Kyiv. In May and June 2022 elements of the 90th Tank Division and 76th VDV Division attacked together in the Lysychansk sector, specifically to the west of Hirske in the clashes to cut the T1302 Highway. The armored vehicles of the 90th Division for instance bore the \"V\" mark (typical of the VDV) instead of their own \"O\". Then the 76th was sent to Kherson where it remained until the Russian withdrawal; the fates of the two formations met again in November, since then the 41st Army and the 76th VDV Division fought side by side until last month in the Serebrianka Forest. The 90th Tank Division, which fields BMPTs, was instrumental in providing armored support and increased fire volumes to VDV units.\n\nMashovets last month spoke of the deployment of the 70th Motorized Division of the new 18th Combined Arms Army in the first rear line near Kherson. It's a full-manned division: three motorized, one tank and one artillery regiments. It would have been transferred from Crimea according to what he said, where it was probably trained. At least one regiment appears to be largely made up of Dagestanis. \n\nMeanwhile, it had been said that the new 18th Army will include two corps: the 22nd and the 40th. The 22nd Corps already exists (since 2016), it's formed by the 126th Coastal Defense Brigade and the 127th Reconnaissance Brigade and is deployed near Kherson. The 40th Corps is being formed and had been said to be composed by the 47th Motorized Division and the 144th Motorized Brigade. It will definitely be part of the Southern Military District and will be led by the former commander of the 22nd Corps. \n\nThe 47th MRD would be formed in Crimea, and includes many mobilized locals. If there's anything I have tried to figure out but have not been able to, it's to get whether the 47th and 70th are the same division that perhaps changed numbering during the recent months or they are two different divisions. I personally lean toward the first hypothesis, but we cannot know that for sure yet. In any case, the deployment of this division allowed the 7th VDV Division to be sent to the Orikhiv sector (okay, surely the quality of the two formations is not remotely comparable). \n\nThe personnel of the 144th MRB appears to be largely made up of volunteers (and perhaps mobilized?) from the North Caucasus, such as Kabardino-Balkaria and Karachay-Cherkessia. They would have carried out the first phase of training in Stavropol (where the 40th Corps is based) and are now finishing the training in Crimea. I find it likely that once they are done with the training they will join the rest of the 18th Army in the Kherson Oblast along the Dnipro, allowing other units, such as the elements of the 49th Army still in Kherson or the 80th Brigade of the Arctic Fleet, to depart towards the Southern front.

Also between Svatove and Kreminna there is the 20th Army of the Western MD: its 144th MRD is active just to the north of the Serebrianka Forest while the 3rd MRD is currently mainly used as a tactical/operational reserve in the Svatove sector.</p>\n\n<p>At the moment the deployed elements of the 25th Army would in fact have been attached to the 41st Army, which continues to be deployed in the Kreminna sector. It&#39;s important to emphasize this because according to Budanov, sending the 25th Army into the area would have been instrumental in order to transfer the 41st Army to the Southern front. It&#39;s possible that at the moment the 25th Army still doesn&#39;t have a working general staff and is still too weak to be deployed as a stand-alone formation in a given sector and therefore needs to be framed in another army.</p>\n\n<p>The 41st Army itself is not particularly competent (it can boast the crossing disaster of the Siversky Donets in May 2022), but it&#39;s pretty large compared to the average: two motorized brigades, a mountain brigade and a tank division are its maneuver formations. This army has been covering the Kreminna sector since October of the last year, when it was beaten in the battles between Lyman and Yampil. A deployment of the army to the Southern front (which has never seen the presence of CMD formations during this conflict) would be a very strange thing. It&#39;s possible that the Russians are in a situation where they have no other choice though. If the dispatch to the South is confirmed, I find it possible that they will wait for the arrival of the rest of the 25th Army and then transfer the whole Kreminna sector into their hands. The 41st Army is certainly not at 100% capacities but should still be in acceptable conditions to withstand a deployment to an area far hotter than Kreminna. The 90th Tank Division during the spring received batches of T-90Ms and T-80BVs, certainly an improvement compared to the T-72A/Bs they entered the Chernihiv Oblast with, back in February 2022.</p>\n\n<p>It has to be said that the 41st Army has a history of cooperation with the VDV, particularly with the 76th Division. The deputy commander of the 41st Army, Sukhovetsky, was killed in Hostomel. Actually, the 41st Army&#39;s task was to take Chernihiv, cross the Desna River and reach Kyiv from the east. It was a resounding failure: its three brigades (35th, 55th, and 74th) were defeated in the siege of Chernihiv while the 90th Tank Division was ambushed several times on the way to Kyiv (also owing to a lack of dismounts) and was finally stopped and then pushed back in Brovary. It was the biggest debacle of the early phase of the conflict, along with the fuck-up of the 1st Tank Army between Sumy and Kharkiv. What was Sukhovetsky doing on the other side of the Dnipro? It&#39;s possible that the 41st Army was subordinate to Serdyukov and the VDV General Staff, i.e. the protagonists of the plan to seize Kyiv. In May and June 2022 elements of the 90th Tank Division and 76th VDV Division attacked together in the Lysychansk sector, specifically to the west of Hirske in the clashes to cut the T1302 Highway. The armored vehicles of the 90th Division for instance bore the &quot;V&quot; mark (typical of the VDV) instead of their own &quot;O&quot;. Then the 76th was sent to Kherson where it remained until the Russian withdrawal; the fates of the two formations met again in November, since then the 41st Army and the 76th VDV Division fought side by side until last month in the Serebrianka Forest. The 90th Tank Division, which fields BMPTs, was instrumental in providing armored support and increased fire volumes to VDV units.</p>\n\n<p>Mashovets last month spoke of the deployment of the 70th Motorized Division of the new 18th Combined Arms Army in the first rear line near Kherson. It&#39;s a full-manned division: three motorized, one tank and one artillery regiments. It would have been transferred from Crimea according to what he said, where it was probably trained. At least one regiment appears to be largely made up of Dagestanis. </p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, it had been said that the new 18th Army will include two corps: the 22nd and the 40th. The 22nd Corps already exists (since 2016), it&#39;s formed by the 126th Coastal Defense Brigade and the 127th Reconnaissance Brigade and is deployed near Kherson. The 40th Corps is being formed and had been said to be composed by the 47th Motorized Division and the 144th Motorized Brigade. It will definitely be part of the Southern Military District and will be led by the former commander of the 22nd Corps. </p>\n\n<p>The 47th MRD would be formed in Crimea, and includes many mobilized locals. If there&#39;s anything I have tried to figure out but have not been able to, it&#39;s to get whether the 47th and 70th are the same division that perhaps changed numbering during the recent months or they are two different divisions. I personally lean toward the first hypothesis, but we cannot know that for sure yet. In any case, the deployment of this division allowed the 7th VDV Division to be sent to the Orikhiv sector (okay, surely the quality of the two formations is not remotely comparable). </p>\n\n<p>The personnel of the 144th MRB appears to be largely made up of volunteers (and perhaps mobilized?) from the North Caucasus, such as Kabardino-Balkaria and Karachay-Cherkessia. They would have carried out the first phase of training in Stavropol (where the 40th Corps is based) and are now finishing the training in Crimea. I find it likely that once they are done with the training they will join the rest of the 18th Army in the Kherson Oblast along the Dnipro, allowing other units, such as the elements of the 49th Army still in Kherson or the 80th Brigade of the Arctic Fleet, to depart towards the Southern front.

What's sure is that mobilization efforts in 2023 had slowed down substantially and the new recruits of this year (although I doubt Medvedev's numbers) are mainly contract soldiers: the wages, bonuses, promised support measures to the families, etc. are enough to attract enough a sizeable amount of desperate people from the poorest regions of the country.

The \"Cossack Volunteer Assault Corps\", consisting of four brigades (three of which already exist and have been active in Ukraine since last year) and 20 thousand men, has been formed.

The PMC Sokol-1, owned by the magnate Deripaska (who owns Rusal) and close to the 7th VDV Division, is reportedly converting into an air assault regiment. My theory that some of the members of the dissolving PMCs might be destined for the VDV would thus find confirmation. Recall that the latter is forming two new regiments to be assigned to the 98th and 106th Divisions; it's also forming a new division (the 104th, which should be formed by the 31st VDV Brigade, a regiment of the Territorial Forces and another one formed by elements of the 83rd Brigade) and an artillery brigade. New VDV brigades might be created in the future. Then there is the 44th Airborne Division, which, however, owes its name to the fact that it's trained in Ryazan by the VDV but I'm not sure whether it's going to be an integral part of the paratroopers; it consists of a regiment from the Mobilization Reserve and one from the Territorial Forces. The \"Hispaniola\" Battalion, active in Bakhmut, close to PMC Wagner and formed by football hooligans with far-right sympathies, is set to become a special forces unit (it already boasts an UAV company).

The most recent episode is an interview with Franz-Stefan Gady called \"What if the deep battle doesn't matter?\" Hopefully some of you can chime in with some thoughts on this.\n\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/this-means-war/id1629454648    \nhttps://open.spotify.com/show/76gkil0k0eiodxzlouYl20\n\nAnother recommendation for history buffs is the Unauthorized History of the Pacific War Podcast, hosted by Seth Paridon, WWII historian and deputy director of the Mississippi Armed Forces Museum, and retired Captain Bill Toti, former skipper of the fast attack submarine USS Indianapolis and commodore of Submarine Squadron 3 at Pearl Harbor. Seth is an excellent historian and having a former practitioner really sets it apart from other accounts. The first season (episodes numbered 1XX) was basically a chronological history up to the end of the Guadalcanal campaign. The second season (2XX) continues the war but also skips around and has an emphasis on submarines, where it is especially excellent. Frequent guests include Jon Parshall, Richard Frank, Dave Holland, and Drachinfel. If you're interested in the history of the Pacific War, or warfare at all, it has my strong recommendation.

It&#39;s also available on YouTube.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEtshZLnRTc\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEtshZLnRTc</a> (Submarines 101 or &quot;How to Submarine&quot;)<br/>\n<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-unauthorized-history-of-the-pacific-war/id1641383288\">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-unauthorized-history-of-the-pacific-war/id1641383288</a><br/>\n<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/2H2ZWZv74FAeLhSbwghJnt\">https://open.spotify.com/show/2H2ZWZv74FAeLhSbwghJnt</a></p>\n</div>",

            "body": "> The most recent episode is an interview with Franz-Stefan Gady called \"What if the deep battle doesn't matter?\" Hopefully some of you can chime in with some thoughts on this.\n\nThe title of the episode is a little sensationalist (as seems to be the norm with a lot of media on the war, IE \"Are tanks obsolete?\" Actual discussion: more nuanced No) as the discussion was not completely oriented around attrition vs deep battle as more like what mix of both. The podcasters generally seemed critical of the concept of deep battle and center of gravity and they made a few assertions that I generally disagreed with, though I think they asked some thought provoking questions and I do think it's valid to discuss the merits/demerits of the concept.\n\n> Deep battle produced more casualties, therefor Deep battle bad.\n\nArguably speaking that's debatable as it depends on how you define casualties. Unhelpfully casualties is a catch all term that can create false impressions. \n\nYou look at the casualties of operation barbarossa, yes over 100k died on the German side. But crucially, the Soviets suffer 4x the losses of the Germans and half their entire army is captured. \n\nThe *whole point* of deep battle is inflicting maximum damage on the enemy, 100k dead to capture entire armies of millions is a good trade in a military conflict. Deep battle allows the attacking force to inflict huge casualties on the defending force. Compared to WW1, in which the attacking force nearly always took more casualties than the defenders. \n\n> Deep battle is unproven, often failed\n\nThe speakers talk about WW2 and the eastern front as an example of a failure of maneuver/deep battle warfare due to its high casualties but I disagree here. As cited above, Germany saw immense operational success in 41. There's also the performance of the Germans against the French, a maneuver army trounced an attrition army.  \n\nIt's arguably as Germany moves *away* from maneuver warfare, to its grinding attritional fights and the stand-fast no retreat mentalities, going into 43 and onwards, that they actually start doing worse and worse. They don't completely abandon maneuver warfare as a concept but the Wehrmacht certainly transitioned away from the idea of the mobile defense and counteroffensive mentality that had done so well for them before. \n\nIronically, the commentators note how the Germans were defeated so badly in the artillery war, which points towards Germany's failure to transition to an attritional style of fighting.\n\nLook at more contemporaneous examples, the Deep battle doctrine absolutely crushed the Republican Guard in Iraq and the KPA in Korea. I also think there's a thing to be said for the Russian invasion, which was highly successful despite its eventual failures.\n\nArguably speaking, if Russia had been allowed to conduct the invasion according to its military doctrine, without the political restrictions placed on it, by mobilizing its reserves/conscripts into its second echelon units, Ukraine could have even been defeated last year. People forget how touch and go things were at the start of the war, with Russia overrunning the countryside. With enough manpower, they could have encircled formations of the Ukrainian army and crushed them in piecemeal or starved them out. They still wouldn't have taken Kyiv, but they certainly would've taken Sumy, Chernihiv, Mikolyiav, maybe even Kharkiv. It was the lack of manpower that allowed the AFU to move through the Russian rear so unimpeded and wage a mobile defense. \n\n> Deep battle requires intensive training, expensive to maintain army\n\nI agree with their assessment on the the needs of Deep battle but I don't necessarily agree with their conclusion being that it's bad. If anything, it shows how costly it can be being under prepared for a sudden conflict, as it takes a long time of either training, or combat, to develop the necissary skill set to conduct maneuver warfare.\n\nMilitaries which extensively trained their troops prior to a conflict had a decisive edge against those who had not. Germany in 1914 had the most well trained army in Europe and it showed, their deep battle offensive into France was devastating. Likewise, the same happened again during the early years of WW2. The fact that these wars were so long, I think speaks more to how successful deep battle is as a concept, because the resource and manpower disparity on both sides of the conflict would lead you to conclude that Germany *should* have been defeated much earlier. \n\nWe're now seeing a war in which both sides have under trained armies, and how painful its going to be for Ukraine to dig the Russian tick out of its lands with an attritional style conflict. \n\nPersonally, my take away from this war isn't that Deep battle doesn't matter, but rather that countries should avoid a situation where they cannot conduct manuever warfare if a peer to peer conflict is remotely likely.",

The Soviets were building up their army so there wasn't much space along the front to actually make such attacks. Keep in mind the Germans attacked with a numerical superiority in terms of manpower in 1941 and also had initiative and were prepared logistically for the initial offensive. The Soviets, especially in 1942 conducted counterattacks that had insane losses but also caused massive losses to the Germans themselves. Barbarossa itself caused a lot of losses to the Germans, specifically, in combat units. The German fuel situation was also very bad not only in local places due to issues of the logistics, but in Germany as a whole. The logistics were also getting worse and worse. Just look at the small force that was allocated for the summer offensive which was the last German offensive of strategic value in the Eastern front. Also, I think this maneuver defense required units with transport vehicles and also tank units alongside infantry and artillery. I don't think you can do maneuver defense with only infantry on wagons with horses which was the vast majority of the German army, when you are fighting the advancing Soviets who also had tank units, units with transport vehicles, plus the artillery build up. And all of that is just in 1942. The point is, if the Germans did not stand their ground and if they attempted to do offensives, the situation would have been even worse.",

                        "body": "Interesting. Yeah, I could see that. So the idea with passive control is to use the aircraft's physical design to help keep it stable. The classic example is a ball hanging on a rod, i.e. a pendulum. Because of gravity, the ball will stay at the bottom position naturally. If it is \"disturbed\" from that position, like if you spin the rod so that it's at 90 degrees instead of 0, it will naturally return to the bottom position. This is what's happening with tail fins. If an aircraft starts to yaw, the fins act to resist that motion, no matter which direction it yaws. So it is what we call \"conditionally stable\", with the condition being true up to some yaw rate.\n\nWithout tail fins, nothing resists any yaw motion. Say the aircraft fires a missile from its wing (unlikely in this design, but it's just an example). It'll experience a slight yawing torque from the momentum change. Suddenly the aircraft is yawing slightly. It'll continue to yaw until the fuselage itself stabilizes it, if it can at all. Needless to say, the \"critical yaw rate\" at which point your aircraft transitions from stable to unstable is substantially lower without a tail fin than with a tail fin. So it'll need something to exert a counter-torque to stabilize if you want to reestablish control. This is an active control technique since it only happens if you make it happen. Contrast with the passive control of the stabilizer fins, which happens simply by existing.\n\nThe darpa program sounds plausible. Another option might be some very fine thrust vectoring from the jets, but I'd have to see the stability plots. Though it should go without saying that those who can see the stability plots will never talk about them publicly. More's the pity; stability analysis is on the \"fun\" side of engineering work.",

Another option might be some very fine thrust vectoring from the jets, but I&#39;d have to see the stability plots. Though it should go without saying that those who can see the stability plots will never talk about them publicly. More&#39;s the pity; stability analysis is on the &quot;fun&quot; side of engineering work.</p>\n</div>",

The border between enforcing the security of member countries even against trivial mistakes and just waiting for an excuse to send in the tanks is rather volatile and its location is easily misportrayed in public discourse, so it would substantially degrade the alliance's claims about its defensive character. And it would set a precedent that's difficult to follow safely: once you respond to an incident of this sort, it hard not to respond to provocations of a similar intensit, which would weaken NATO's defensive by making it easier to draw the alliance into conflicts on unfavourable terms.\n\nA restrained response is also a very good PR move at this point IMHO. The Kremlin has spent seven-figures budgets, over almost a decade, to build an image of a peace-loving country that's being encroached upon by warmongering NATO hawks. That image went out the window once the allegedly peace-loving country launched an open invasion on its neighbour. Not only does a  restrained response to provocations and incidents drive home the point that his is a blatant lie, it further errodes Russia's international credibility, as its foreign ministry still hasn't changed its line.",

Raise wages and provide a stable career for potential new recruits. Downsizing and a lack of wage growth these past few decades makes a career as a soldier financially less sustainable that it used to be. This is the case for many other public professions (e.g. teachers) and the solution is quite simple really - make a career in the military more attractive than one in the private sector.\n\n2. Focus more on high-value assets. This is already the case in some countries in Europe. In short, continue to offer careers in more in-demand areas (e.g. special forces, fighter pilots) whilst reducing manpower-intensive investment like infantry. Case in point is e.g. The Netherlands ($15.6bn, 41k active personnel) vs. Poland ($16.6bn, 180k active personnel) in 2022 terms. \n\n3. Recruitment abroad. The US does this as well, but I think the real gems are the Gurkhas in the UK and French Foreign Legion. Both of these programmes can be expanded significantly and offer relatively unlimited pools of recruits for infantry roles that might be more out of favor domestically.\n\n4. Integrate military structures. This is more of a solution within Europe than the US. Integrating armies of varying capabilities into a single force can be daunting, but it does get rid of duplicate structures  (e.g. C&C) and can therefore make more efficient use of existing resources. In Europe there are furtive examples, either via the EU and NATO, or through bilateral agreements (particularly in the case of Germany and its neighbors), but it could be significantly expanded. \n\n5. Automation. I think many will directly think of drones or AI technologies, but there's also simpler solutions like switching away from 2-seater jets or using auto-loaders in MBTs. The problem with this path is that it is difficult to predict how effective it will be. More advanced equipment probably also needs more maintenance, which in turn requires more staff. I'm not convinced AI and military robots necessarily reduce manpower needs, but instead shift it from frontline to support.\n\n6. (edit addition) Loosen recruitment standards. There's a lot of talk about how a lot of potential recruits are nowadays overweight or have other health issues that make them unsuitable. If obesity is a real issue, perhaps offering bootcamps tailored specifically to dealing with overcoming obesity might be a solution. This would require armed forces to perhaps spend more attention to nutrition and mental health than they'd like, but it would certainly alleviate the issue somewhat, and perhaps be a selling point as well.",

When they start moving, people start saying that the Russian forces have been broken and we&#39;re about to see rapid movements from the Ukrainians. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/160xas2/credibledefense_daily_megathread_august_25_2023/jxtfoky/\">I said as much three weeks ago</a> when people were getting excited about Ukrainian gains.</p>\n\n<p>Even the people on the ground are going to have a hard time knowing if things have stabilized or if theirs going to be rapid geographic movement. People far from the conflict and only having access to very limited information aren&#39;t going to have any idea.</p>\n</div>",

So it's not very surprising that progress on that front has slowed after the early \"momentum\" Ukraine built up with the capture of Robotyne and penetration of Russian lines near Verbove. \n\nWhat's telling to me though is that Russia transferred units from active fronts like the Svatove-Kreminna line (where they're launching a diversionary effort against Kupyansk) and I believe the Bakhmut front (where Ukraine has been slowly advancing at a high cost of attrition to Russian units) to send forces to the Tokmak axis. Clearly they were concerned about the potential for a Ukrainian breakthrough near Robotyne/Verbove and acted accordingly. \n\nWhat we don't know and can't see, is the state of both forces. OSINT gives us insight through visually confirmed equipmeny losses, which are more or less even on the Zaporizhzhia front and slightly favor Ukraine across the entire battlefield since the offensive began. But it's hard to tell which side is suffering more personnel losses, which side has more ammunition, which side has better morale, and which side is closer to breaking. \n\nMy personal opinion is that Ukraine is dealing marginally more attrition than they're receiving and slowly eating away at Russian forces all along the front. Attrition among more \"elite\" Russian formations like the VDV is most important as they're really the only offensive-capable force Russia still has available to it, and those losses are going to only further deplete Russia's miniscule offensive potential. But Ukraine is also suffering heavy losses in men and materiel, and it's hard to know how much support they're going to get from the West over the medium to longterm. Most critical is artillery ammunition which they're burning through rapidly to make progress against Russian fortifications and attrit high priority Russian targets. I think Ukraine will make more modest gains over the next few months until both they and the Russian army are effectively spent and fighting dies down significantly over the winter.",

In reality, after the end of the First Chechen War, the newly formed Ichkeria immediately fell into chaos, as various factions fought each other over total control.

            "body": "> There seems to be an awful lot of turmoil for a military that is supposedly laser focused on closing the gap between the US and the PLA. \n\nGiven the timelines Xi is planning on, these disruptions might mean little to China's overall plans for its military. They are aiming for parity with or superiority over the US by 2049, so a little leadership shakeup 25 years before that date doesn't seem like it is necessarily going to disrupt the overall contours of their plan, since a certain number of leadership changes are inevitable across such a long period of time. That said, the current disruptions may signal deeper problems (more on that below).\n\nEstimates for when they intend to invade Taiwan are much earlier, though, and vary from a date within the next year to dates as far as 10 years or more out, with most estimates clustering around 2027. A leadership shakeup four years ahead of the \"big day\" also doesn't seem like it is necessarily a sign of major difficulties. It's entirely possible Xi is pushing through these changes immediately because it is one of the last opportunities to swap out defense or foreign ministers before the invasion while still giving the replacements enough time to settle into their position and then receive an honest performance evaluation or two before any further changes in personnel are made. That process could conceivably eat up a year or two for such major positions, where the leader's ability to turn the organization around is drastically limited by the immense momentum such large and naturally (small c) conservative institutions as foreign ministries and national militaries (especially of countries with over a billion citizens) can develop over many decades of corruption, atrophy, and irrelevance. The CCP has only recently, over the past decade, begun seriously to roll back those negative trends, and so it isn't entirely surprising that more work remains. As long as no sudden, unexpected economic or political collapses threaten their ability to continue to generate new and improved forces for a confrontation with the US, and they avoid falling into the same trap as Russia did by systematically convincing itself of its own propaganda which wildly exaggerated its military capabilities, they have plenty of time to get things back on track, if indeed they are off track significantly in the first place.\n\nThat said, these sudden upheavals may be among the first symptoms of deeper dysfunction, especially in light of the near constant stream of gloomy economic reports filtering out from China over the past few months. That dysfunction may not come totally into focus until sometime in the future when we have more clarity about events that are ongoing now. But if it is occurring, we may simply be witnessing the far downstream effects of cracks forming in the financial system around local budget shortfalls due to depressed property sales, from taxes on which Chinese localities derive most of the funding they use to support basic services (including healthcare!) in their jurisdictions.\n\nMeaning, Xi may effectively be throwing some high level sacrificial goats to the wolves to deflect blame for the shortfalls away from Xi himself and instead back on to some of his cronies by very publicly holding them accountable, likely for what had previously been tacitly tolerated forms of corruption but which are now providing an easy excuse to purge the most convenient scapegoats. Or perhaps simply the most unlucky or unpopular scapegoats.\n\nIn any case, all of this amounts almost entirely to speculation, because the Chinese intentionally keep their system opaque to outsiders, so we probably won't know how to interpret some of these leadership changes for some time, if ever.",

        "body": "As someone who really wants to believe Ukraine can reclaim its territory back - how realistic is that of a proposition given current circumstances?\n\nThe offensive since July has reclaimed, in its most sucessful axis of attack, 10km of land. If we postulate that the advance along the T0408 to the borders of Novoprokopivka took two months to achieve, and that advance will continue at the same rate in the future, the next 20km before Tokmak will take another 4 months, bringing us to January, with Melitopol or Berdyansk another 50km further (i.e. November 2024). Mariupol or Crimea would still be beyond that point, maybe being breached in 2025. This is ignoring that offensives might slow down in fall and winter. \n\nOffensives of course in no way advance linearly in a straight line from point A to B, but the above does raise a few questions for me that I hope some might be able to answer:\n\n1. Is there any reason to suppose that current advances are just slow and that in the future Ukraine will be able to regain land at a faster rate? During the Battle for Normandy the allies were stuck in the area of the Cotentin peninsula for significantly longer than anticipated, before breaking out and driving through France at a rate of 50km a day in some places. Is something like this realistic for Ukraine? On the flipside, could we assume the opposite, that Ukraine's advance is only going to slow down from here on out?\n\n2. Does Ukraine have (or continue to have) the resources to proactively advance? If this war continues with its current intenstity into 2025 or beyond, would its current offensive potential not be blunted due to equipment losses? More materiel is coming to replace losses, but Europe is largely out of reserve stock of MBTs and IFVs whilst the US is reluctant to send anything with DU armor. This means that the amount of equipment that can be sent in the future is somewhat limited unless governments decide to send in-service materiel. Artillery ammunition stockpiles in the west are also low, with reserve stockpiles of cluster munitions or transfer trades with SK not being a long term solution. Long(er) distance strike capability will also taper out as Storm Shadow (and equivalent) missiles run out. Production is picking up (and alternatives exist if F-16s come into service next year) - but is it enough if this war runs on for another 3 years? \n\n3. Related to point 2, how likely is 'war fatigue' amongst Ukrainian supporters? While Eastern European states continue to show strong support, there is significantly more mixed support further west in places like France or Italy. Perhaps most importantly, as the largest (by far) supporter of Ukraine, how reliable would the US be as a partner in the coming years? Much relies on elections, but realistically is there appetite for similar spending like the $44bn+ (amount of course up for debate) on an annual basis in the coming years?\n\n4. Will Russia's capability continue to degrade? By and large this has been a truth over that past 18 months, but can we presume that will continue to happen? Russia is hurrying to retrofit and bring back into service older equipment, of which stockpiles continue to be quite large. Losing items such as the S-400 this week hurts of course, but will this make a difference in the long term? With Russia no longer attempting large offensive actions, its equipment losses should be much lower than they were last year too. With a significantly larger population, Russia is able to soak up personnel losses at a higher rate than Ukraine as well. How significant could aid (munitions in particular) be from NK?\n\nI'm really taking a devil's advocate position on a number of the above questions (nor am i arguing that their axioms are correct - please prove me wrong!), but i'd love to hear some of the positions people on this sub have.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>As someone who really wants to believe Ukraine can reclaim its territory back - how realistic is that of a proposition given current circumstances?</p>\n\n<p>The offensive since July has reclaimed, in its most sucessful axis of attack, 10km of land. If we postulate that the advance along the T0408 to the borders of Novoprokopivka took two months to achieve, and that advance will continue at the same rate in the future, the next 20km before Tokmak will take another 4 months, bringing us to January, with Melitopol or Berdyansk another 50km further (i.e. November 2024). Mariupol or Crimea would still be beyond that point, maybe being breached in 2025. This is ignoring that offensives might slow down in fall and winter. </p>\n\n<p>Offensives of course in no way advance linearly in a straight line from point A to B, but the above does raise a few questions for me that I hope some might be able to answer:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Is there any reason to suppose that current advances are just slow and that in the future Ukraine will be able to regain land at a faster rate? During the Battle for Normandy the allies were stuck in the area of the Cotentin peninsula for significantly longer than anticipated, before breaking out and driving through France at a rate of 50km a day in some places. Is something like this realistic for Ukraine? On the flipside, could we assume the opposite, that Ukraine&#39;s advance is only going to slow down from here on out?</p></li>\n<li><p>Does Ukraine have (or continue to have) the resources to proactively advance? If this war continues with its current intenstity into 2025 or beyond, would its current offensive potential not be blunted due to equipment losses? More materiel is coming to replace losses, but Europe is largely out of reserve stock of MBTs and IFVs whilst the US is reluctant to send anything with DU armor. This means that the amount of equipment that can be sent in the future is somewhat limited unless governments decide to send in-service materiel. Artillery ammunition stockpiles in the west are also low, with reserve stockpiles of cluster munitions or transfer trades with SK not being a long term solution. Long(er) distance strike capability will also taper out as Storm Shadow (and equivalent) missiles run out. Production is picking up (and alternatives exist if F-16s come into service next year) - but is it enough if this war runs on for another 3 years? </p></li>\n<li><p>Related to point 2, how likely is &#39;war fatigue&#39; amongst Ukrainian supporters?
