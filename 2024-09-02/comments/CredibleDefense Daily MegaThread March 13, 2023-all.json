        "body": "[Carnegie Connects with Michael Kofman and Aaron David Miller.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgsg9vbYxY) \n\nNotes:\n\n- State of war according to Kofman: War in transitional period, positional fighting. Late Jan Russian military began winter offensive composed of 5-6 different operations. Underwhelming results. Highly regional fighting, Vuhledar very different from Kreminna etc. Bakhmut least advantageous battle for Ukraine, flanks folding, city holding. Tension in the air, Ukraine building up force for offensive operations, unknown target. Current state of affairs will not continue. \n\n- Is war being reported in Western media accurately? Is there a gap in reporting? There is a gap, there's always a gap in war but it varies. Not borne of malice/incompetence, just a fact of war. Highly regional aspect of fighting makes generalizing narratives fraught proposition. People that have the most access to the press are senior officials who shape narratives instrumentally as part of their job. Social media provides caricature of war. Very narrow window. \n\n- Is there one thing we're not understanding or is being under reported wrt to Ukrainian military? Transformation of Ukrainian military. Neither army looks remotely like they did when the war began, both have suffered severe losses. Large swathes of pre-war expertise is now outdated in terms of analysis of both militaries. \n\n- What have the Russians learned that has improved their performance? Russian military less ossified than it may appear. Some outlying examples such as Vuhledar but across the battle there are adaptations in force structure, tactics. Ukrainian losses around Bakhmut largely due to Wagner assault detachments conducting both day and nighttime assaults (different units for different times) composed of experienced fighters with fire support that capitalize on exhaustion caused by attacks by expendable troops such as prisoners. (Kofman is circumspect here) A lot of Ukrainian military does Mission Command at least in some respects by default, in contrast Russia not nearly as flexible. On the other hand Ukrainian suffers from Soviet officers lacking in experience. Best people lost first. \n\n- Unpack Bakhmut. What is the importance of the city? Perhaps the most significant battle from a political standpoint. Ukrainian leadership has chosen to make Bakhmut politically symbolic, to make it a contest of will with the Russian armed forces. Advantageous battle up to a point but now diminishing returns. After loss of Soledar position has become more precarious. Suspects Ukraine will attempt to hold Bakhmut until able to launch their own counteroffensive. City not rubblized, Ukraian forces control high rises in western part of the city. MSR increasingly contested by Russian forces. \n\n- If UAF retreats from Bakhmut, does it matter? Not really, Ukraine has favorable positions west of the city. Russia has no supporting axis of advance. Russia would probably turn it's attack north. No strategic calamity in the event of withdrawal. \n\n- Can you imagine the war shifting in a way that would change the momentum of the way the war is playing out? (I read this as moving beyond positional battle back into maneuver, perhaps it just means a change in initiative though) Yes, most definitely. Major offensive by Ukrainian military in coming months. Will likely see series of attacks like Kherson. Unknown location, probably several months of operations not single operation over short time period. Will see change in momentum regardless. Ukrainian ability to achieve breakthrough remains in question, no way of knowing. Challenge made more difficult by high density of Russian forces and entrenched lines. On the other hand, current offensive spending Russian manpower and ammunition. \n\n- Is Ukraine in a hurry to do something big? Yes, longer Ukraine waits greater the risk of assumption of stalemate in West and sapping of political will. Also more time spent waiting, more time for Russia to entrench. Greatest window of opportunity to liberate more territory when Western equipment comes in sufficient quantity along with buildup of additional forces combined with relative Russian weakness. Longer UAF waits, lower the relative advantage. \n\n- Does Ukraine now have the equipment they need to mount a significant counteroffensive? They have some of the \"stuff\" they need, putting together three army corps. Assembling equipment and personnel for this, hoping west will provide sufficient artillery ammunition. Ukraine an artillery army. Currently rationing shells, real shortage on the front. Real challenge Ukraine has is not \"stuff' but force quality. They have morale and will get material. Many mobilized without prior service, equipment alone does not enable combined arms operations. \n\n- Tanks and F16s. Are these discretionary or vital equipment? Are they irrelevant to the battlefield dynamic and if so, when would they become relevant? Tanks matter, Ukraine has lost a lot of tanks, has received a lot of tanks. In the past have been lower priority than other items Ukraine needed (artillery). Tier list: 1) Artillery ammunition and barrels 2) GBAD ammo 3) AFVs, specifically protected mobility 4) Tanks to replace losses. On way out of Bakhmut, Kofman passed reinforcing tank platoon composed entirely of Russian T-80s captured from 1st Guards in Izyum. Ukraine needs spare parts for T-series tanks. War does not depend on # of western tanks delivered. F16s least important item to be delivered. **Kofman believes decisive phase of war coming this spring-summer.** Priority should be to backfill Ukrainian forces for losses they're likely to experience in upcoming offensive. \n\n- Elaborate on comment on decisive phase of war? Can you see a situation where a Ukrainian counteroffensive causes a significant break in Russian forces or control of the Donbas? Sure. \"In these conversations we have to have bit of kind of decisive sophistry\" If Ukraine can sever Russian GLOC to Crimea, could have significant effects on Russian ability to sustain war. War wouldn't be over in such a situation, war termination up to loser. In coming months likely to see best prospects for an offensive operation that could affect the trajectory of the conflict. That is meaning of \"decisive\". \n\n- Sidebar about the notion of military victory ending conflict being something that people should reconsider. \n\n- Does this all ultimately come down to mass? (quote about quantity as quality is misattributed twice) Large scale conventional wars come down to attrition. Reconstituting force and managing manpower and material. Side better able to reconstitute can impose dilemmas on opponent. Safe bet that Russia will conduct another phase of mobilization rather than not. Ukraine's best prospects are this year. War is numbers game, Western tanks are \"cool\" but meaningless if not delivered in volume. \n\n- Russian resilience. To what degree will Russia remain a problem after the war regardless of how military phase of war turns out? Russia goes through cycles of resurgence, stagnation, decline. Kofman and others such as Andrea Kendall-Taylor very wary that because Russia suffering strategic defeat it will naturally undergo some period of decline and that people will write them off falsely. Russia is not NK or Iran, will remain geopolitically relevant. Russia is not \"done\" after this, cannot be forgotten. \n\n- Escalation (don't want to talk about it because it's predictive). Likelihood of nuclear escalation? Carnegie analysts, many of whom are Russian born, are very wary of consequences should Russia's hold over Crimea be threatened. Where does Kofman stand? Acute risk of nuclear escalation has receded but has not gone away. Conditions based. If there is any point at which Russian leadership would consider use of nuclear weapons it would be an event wherein Russian military leadership loses effective C&C of the Russian military in Ukraine. Cascade collapse. Not operational defeat but real catastrophic event. Ultimately up to Putin. Don't count on fairytales, Russian weapons will work, Russian forces will cary out orders. Worry that if one used tens will be. \n\n- What is the US strategy in Ukraine? Is it to allow the Ukrainians to inflict sufficient losses on Russia that Putin concludes the war cannot continue and negotiates? Not cost-driven. Attempt to convey to Russian leaders that their political objectives cannot be achieved. Second goal to convince Russian leadership that increasing length of war increases risk to regime. Challenge that strategic defeat for Russia is not victory for Ukraine. Some people in DC believe the former already achieved. (Good dodge by Kofman not to critique Victoria Nuland)\n\nSorry this turned out enormous.",

There are obviously different factors which weigh differently and each with their own pro/con, but in the end, he seemed to weigh very concretely in the \u2018longer out is better\u2019 camp. \n\nFirst, just for reference [here is the relevant point in the video](https://youtu.be/mMgsg9vbYxY?t=1193) (19:53). I went back and checked the Geopolitics Decanted ep [he was in recently](https://geopolitics-decanted.simplecast.com/episodes/myth-busting-with-michael-kofman-debunking-common-misperceptions-about-the-ukraine-war) and this question comes up at 15:45 where you're right that he says he thinks it's better to wait a bit longer until the force is reconstituted a bit more rather than rushing but also elaborates a bit\n\n\"I think that the more time they have, to some extent, the better off they are. You can make a counter argument that it also gives the Russian military more time to reconstitute and entrench. You could make another argument on that which is to say that it appears Ukraine is very short on artillery ammunition and is sort of likely living off of what it gets per month from the US and other countries that are supplying it and that no matter how long they wait the US and other countries are likely going to make a big effort to provide them with artillery ammunition for an offensive.\" \n\nHe gets sidetracked at this point and the point is somewhat lost. \n\nIf I had to attempt to reconcile these two statements I'd say they're about different time frames. That there is a window of opportunity approaching but has not yet arrived and that the UAF should wait some time and not launch an offensive immediately but at the same time not wait too long into the summer because that window will be lost by then. \n\n>Not sure if this is a misunderstanding of this term on this end, or if it\u2019s Kofman using it in a layman way, but a point of diminishing returns is not the same as the point of negative returns, especially in a multivariable setting where efficacy and efficiency is optimized differently. I\u2019m tempted to think what he meant was probably the latter, but if it isn\u2019t, people here are coming to the wrong conclusion based purely on this statement.\n\n\nThis segment begins at [12:07](https://youtu.be/mMgsg9vbYxY). The exact quote is \n\n\"My personal impression this is only one analysts view is that Bakhmut was a fairly advantageous battle up to a point but all strategies can reach diminishing returns and in the past couple months especially after losing the northern town of Soledar the Ukrainian position there has become more precarious and I think they're looking to hold on to it.\" \n\nI don't think he's speaking very technically here and that essentially he's saying that the loss ratios have started equalizing.

                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>Sorry, have not listened to the video just yet, and relying entirely on the excellent service you\u2019ve provided, but isn\u2019t this the opposite of the conclusion that he came to in the last two podcasts he did? There are obviously different factors which weigh differently and each with their own pro/con, but in the end, he seemed to weigh very concretely in the \u2018longer out is better\u2019 camp. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>First, just for reference <a href=\"https://youtu.be/mMgsg9vbYxY?t=1193\">here is the relevant point in the video</a> (19:53). I went back and checked the Geopolitics Decanted ep <a href=\"https://geopolitics-decanted.simplecast.com/episodes/myth-busting-with-michael-kofman-debunking-common-misperceptions-about-the-ukraine-war\">he was in recently</a> and this question comes up at 15:45 where you&#39;re right that he says he thinks it&#39;s better to wait a bit longer until the force is reconstituted a bit more rather than rushing but also elaborates a bit</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I think that the more time they have, to some extent, the better off they are. You can make a counter argument that it also gives the Russian military more time to reconstitute and entrench. You could make another argument on that which is to say that it appears Ukraine is very short on artillery ammunition and is sort of likely living off of what it gets per month from the US and other countries that are supplying it and that no matter how long they wait the US and other countries are likely going to make a big effort to provide them with artillery ammunition for an offensive.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>He gets sidetracked at this point and the point is somewhat lost. </p>\n\n<p>If I had to attempt to reconcile these two statements I&#39;d say they&#39;re about different time frames. That there is a window of opportunity approaching but has not yet arrived and that the UAF should wait some time and not launch an offensive immediately but at the same time not wait too long into the summer because that window will be lost by then. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Not sure if this is a misunderstanding of this term on this end, or if it\u2019s Kofman using it in a layman way, but a point of diminishing returns is not the same as the point of negative returns, especially in a multivariable setting where efficacy and efficiency is optimized differently. I\u2019m tempted to think what he meant was probably the latter, but if it isn\u2019t, people here are coming to the wrong conclusion based purely on this statement.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This segment begins at <a href=\"https://youtu.be/mMgsg9vbYxY\">12:07</a>. The exact quote is </p>\n\n<p>&quot;My personal impression this is only one analysts view is that Bakhmut was a fairly advantageous battle up to a point but all strategies can reach diminishing returns and in the past couple months especially after losing the northern town of Soledar the Ukrainian position there has become more precarious and I think they&#39;re looking to hold on to it.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t think he&#39;s speaking very technically here and that essentially he&#39;s saying that the loss ratios have started equalizing. Basically before Ukraine was trading casualties at a 1:5 ratio or some-such and now they&#39;re trading at 1:3 so the &quot;return&quot; they&#39;re getting on their casualties spent is diminished.

They will have a lot of new territory, it's true, but that means a much bigger front line to defend, and less resources to do it with. It may be precarious, it may be manageable and worth the cost. \n\n- An unsuccessful low lost offensive doesn't change anything, they will be able to gear up and go at it again, or decide to go on the attritional defensive again, no harm done. \n\n- The best outcome of course is a low cost successful operation. But as many here are pointing out, it's not clear that this is a surefire thing, likely, or even possible at this point in the war given the defensive depth of the Russians and so forth.\n\nSo looking at it from this perspective, if you're Kyiv you can't simply close your eyes and tell yourself there are no alternatives because you could put possibly yourself in a worse position while having nothing to show for it.

People all over the developing world have had *very* good reason to be concerned that they may one day be targeted for some bullshit invasion or bombing campaign, it has happened numerous times, and unless you're a direct neighbor of Russia, Russia is almost certainly *not* the country you're fearing in that regard.\n\n\nEither you've got a special situation with a neighbor like SK, or maybe you're a post colonial north African nation like Mali or Libya and you've got to worry about the Europeans, or you're a Yemeni/Syrian and you're worried about being subject to a regional proxy war often sponsored indirectly by the USA through client states or directly, as in Syria. Or you're, uh, basically any non-aligned smaller country in south america, the middle east, the Caribbean, or Africa, and you've just won the shittiest lotto in the world and you're now being invaded by America for some random goddamn reason, periodically at least once a decade for pretty much all of living memory. Then, you had the cold war of the previous century, and with that came a whole other set of proxy wars or direct invasions by the USA or USSR in Asia, etc.\n\n\n\nRussia is absolutely *following* precedent, as depressing as that reality is, not setting it. To the extent that they are setting precedents, it's in more narrow ways pertaining to international norms regarding neighbors/independence referendums/unidentified soldiers being sent into another country and passed off as locals, etc. And even then, all of those things pretty routinely happen or have happened in Africa and sometimes other places, it's just that this is happening in modern Europe. None of this shit is without precedent.\n\n\nI'm all for criticizing Russia for their aggression, but let's not warp our perceptions of what's happening or act like it's uniquely evil in world history, even recent history. It's pretty standard evil. It'd be nice to be able to have this discussion without someone screaming \"WhAtaBouTIsm!\", which is an extremely convenient rhetorical device for citizens of a country that opened the century with an illegal invasion of Iraq that resulted in hundreds of thousands to millions of civilian deaths, depending on how you count it. And it was a popular war overall in the beginning, \"largest protests in history\" be damned, just look at the poll numbers for both parties in the beginning.\n\n\nThere are the people who are able to criticize Russia rationally and you can have a real discussion with, and there are others who will brook no nuance and rabidly insist on hyperbole that they're literally as bad as the nazis, are single handedly encouraging nuclear proliferation (Libya getting got after voluntarily giving up their program was a WAY bigger hit than any particular invasion), etc etc. I think part of that is that some people are desperate for some kind of collective moral absolution for very similar atrocities committed by their own countries. Can't really talk about that though, because people are very good at preempting discussion of past actions that have established the international precedents that Russia has even cited at times to justify their actions, by just saying \"oh, you're just an anti American Putin bot, yeah yeah we're responsible for all the world's problems, right \ud83d\ude44\".\n\n\n\nI think if you're from a country where a major defense of your country's actions is to say \"you guys always say we're doing illegal atrocities, it's getting a little old, you know! We didn't do *all* of it\", you should temper your righteous anger just a little bit when someone else does something very fucked up, for the sake of good taste if nothing else.",

However half the blame falls on the DNC, because they gave him so much free press to elevate Hillary, trying to depict him as a clown, but like I said there is a lot of racial and religious divide in the US and when you have someone saying something in your deep prejudice you can't talk about openly, him saying it on TV got the votes. If the MSM just ignores DeSantis I don't think he can win like they did with 45. From an American perspective that initially fell for it unfortunately. :(\n\nPeople can downvote me all they want, but I speak the truth.

However half the blame falls on the DNC, because they gave him so much free press to elevate Hillary, trying to depict him as a clown, but like I said there is a lot of racial and religious divide in the US and when you have someone saying something in your deep prejudice you can&#39;t talk about openly, him saying it on TV got the votes. If the MSM just ignores DeSantis I don&#39;t think he can win like they did with 45. From an American perspective that initially fell for it unfortunately. :(</p>\n\n<p>People can downvote me all they want, but I speak the truth. The longer we hide the problem under the rug, the longer the problem persists.</p>\n</div>",

I'm not sure why but neither side in this war almost ever uses smoke, even when AFV are fired on (which is baffling, as use of smoke launchers is SOP in most western militaries). \n\nSecure just means isolating the breach point by fires in depth, supporting attacks to the flanks as fixing attacks, etc.\n\nReduce is the actual penetration of the obstacles, so in this case we're talking about mines. Generally it's a rather slow process of using either Mine Clearing Line Charges (plastic explosives packed into flexible tubes that are fired out and clear a roughly 8x100 meter lane. Or drive through with a mine plow, aka a Mine Clearing Blade, that pushes mines to the side. Both then get proofed by mine rollers that are where the tracks are, so they take the hit and not the tracks in case a mine is still active.\n\nTank ditches are generally crossed with armored vehicle-launched bridges.

Other obstacles include dragons teeth, and those need to either be blown in place with demo or be towed away with cables. \n\nAnd assault is the part that takes place after getting through the obstacles and then taking out and moving through the defenders' positions.\n\nThe issue with this is its slow and places the engineering vehicles in the lead for however long it takes to clear the obstacles. If the enemy isn't fully suppressed during that period and the engineer's position arent obscured, defenders can target those vehicles specifically. And if so, unless there is a reserve of engineering vehicles they can bring up to replace them while they permanently remove whatever threat disabled/destroyed the previous, then that's mission failure. \n\nTechnically they can use dismounted troops to try to clear lanes through minefields at night, but with modern UAV, that's chancy without thermal defeating camouflage (which do exist).\n\nAll that said, even if a breach is made, if the enemy artillery isn't fully suppressed, and they know where the breach point(s) are located, they can drop scatterable mines all over the place.

Ukraine keeps its running casualty numbers secret, even from its staunchest Western supporters.\n> \n> Statistics aside, an influx of inexperienced draftees, brought in to plug the losses, has changed the profile of the Ukrainian force, which is also suffering from basic shortages of ammunition, including artillery shells and mortar bombs, according to military personnel in the field.\n> \n> \u201cThe most valuable thing in war is combat experience,\u201d said a battalion commander in the 46th Air Assault Brigade, who is being identified only by his call sign, Kupol, in keeping with Ukrainian military protocol. \u201cA soldier who has survived six months of combat and a soldier who came from a firing range are two different soldiers.

During a NATO meeting last month, U.K. Defense Minister Ben Wallace said that 97 percent of Russia\u2019s army was already deployed in Ukraine and that Moscow was suffering \u201cFirst World War levels of attrition.\u201d\n> \n> Kupol said he was speaking out in hopes of securing better training for Ukrainian forces from Washington and that he hopes Ukrainian troops being held back for a coming counteroffensive will have more success than the inexperienced soldiers now manning the front under his command.\n> \n> \u201cThere\u2019s always belief in a miracle,\u201d he said. \u201cEither it will be a massacre and corpses or it\u2019s going to be a professional counteroffensive. There are two options. There will be a counteroffensive either way.\u201d\n> \n> How much increased Western military aid and training will tip the balance in such a spring offensive remains uncertain, given the scars of attrition that are beginning to show.\n> \n> One senior Ukrainian government official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid, called the number of tanks promised by the West a \u201csymbolic\u201d amount. Others privately voiced pessimism that promised supplies would even reach the battlefield in time.\n> \n> \u201cIf you have more resources, you more actively attack,\u201d the senior official said. \u201cIf you have fewer resources, you defend more. We\u2019re going to defend. That\u2019s why if you ask me personally, I don\u2019t believe in a big counteroffensive for us. I\u2019d like to believe in it, but I\u2019m looking at the resources and asking, \u2018With what?\u2019 Maybe we\u2019ll have some localized breakthroughs.\u201d\n> \n> \u201cWe don\u2019t have the people or weapons,\u201d the senior official added. \u201cAnd you know the ratio: When you\u2019re on the offensive, you lose twice or three times as many people. We can\u2019t afford to lose that many people.\u201d\n> \n> \n> Such analysis is far less optimistic than the public statements by Ukraine\u2019s political and military leadership.\n> \n> Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has described 2023 as \u201cthe year of victory\u201d for Ukraine.

Kupol recalled how hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers in units fighting alongside his battalion simply abandoned their positions, even as fighters for Russia\u2019s Wagner mercenary group pressed ahead.\n> \n> After a year of war, Kupol, a lieutenant colonel, said his battalion is unrecognizable. Of about 500 soldiers, roughly 100 were killed in action and another 400 wounded, leading to complete turnover. Kupol said he was now the sole military professional in the battalion, and he described the struggle of leading a unit composed entirely of inexperienced troops.\n> \n> \u201cI get 100 new soldiers,\u201d Kupol said. \u201cThey don\u2019t give me any time to prepare them. They say, \u2018Take them into the battle.\u2019 They just drop everything and run. That\u2019s it. Do you understand why? Because the soldier doesn\u2019t shoot. I ask him why, and he says, \u2018I\u2019m afraid of the sound of the shot.\u2019 And for some reason, he has never thrown a grenade. \u2026 We need NATO instructors in all our training centers, and our instructors need to be sent over there into the trenches. Because they failed in their task.\u201d\n> \n> He described severe ammunition shortages, including a lack of simple mortar bombs and grenades for U.S.-made MK 19s.\n> \n> \n> Ukraine has also faced an acute shortage of artillery shells, which Washington and its allies have scrambled to address, with discussions about how to shore up Ukrainian stocks dominating daily meetings on the war at the White House National Security Council.

            "body": "> The challenges stem from steep losses. Gen. Valery Zaluzhny, Ukraine\u2019s commander in chief, said in August that nearly 9,000 of his soldiers had died. In December, Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelensky, said the number was up to 13,000. But Western officials have given higher estimates and, in any case, the Ukrainian figures excluded the far larger number of wounded who are no longer able to fight.\n> \n> A German official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that Berlin estimates Ukrainian casualties, including dead and wounded, are as high as 120,000. \u201cThey don\u2019t share the information with us because they don\u2019t trust us,\u201d the official said.\n> \n> Meanwhile, a Russian offensive has been building since early January, according to Syrsky. Budanov, Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence chief, told The Post last month that Russia had more than 325,000 soldiers in Ukraine, and another 150,000 mobilized troops could soon join the fight. Ukrainian soldiers report being outnumbered and having less ammunition.\n> \n> \n> The stakes for Ukraine in the coming months are particularly high, as Western countries aiding Kyiv look to see whether Ukrainian forces can once again seize the initiative and reclaim more territory from Russian control.\n> \n> Russia is also facing ammunition, manpower and motivation problems \u2014 and has notched only incremental gains in recent months despite the strained state of Ukraine\u2019s force. As bad as Ukraine\u2019s losses are, Russia\u2019s are worse, the U.S. official said.\n> \n> \u201cThe question is whether Ukraine\u2019s relative advantage is sufficient to attain their objectives, and whether those advantages can be sustained,\u201d said Michael Kofman, a military analyst at Virginia-based CNA. \u201cThat depends not just on them, but also on the West.\u201d\n> \n> Despite reports of untrained mobilized Russian fighters being thrown into battle, Syrsky said those now arriving are well-prepared. \u201cWe have to live and fight in these realities,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s problematic for us. \u2026 It forces us to be more precise in our firing, more detailed in our reconnaissance, more careful in choosing our positions and more detailed in organizing the interaction between the units. There is no other way.\u201d\n> \n> Russia\u2019s recent gains \u2014 notably around Bakhmut \u2014 have not significantly tilted the battlefield, and U.S. military officials have said that even if Russia seizes Bakhmut, it would be of little strategic importance. But given the heavy casualties Ukraine is suffering there, officials in Washington have questioned Kyiv\u2019s refusal to retreat.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>The challenges stem from steep losses. Gen. Valery Zaluzhny, Ukraine\u2019s commander in chief, said in August that nearly 9,000 of his soldiers had died. In December, Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelensky, said the number was up to 13,000. But Western officials have given higher estimates and, in any case, the Ukrainian figures excluded the far larger number of wounded who are no longer able to fight.</p>\n\n<p>A German official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that Berlin estimates Ukrainian casualties, including dead and wounded, are as high as 120,000. \u201cThey don\u2019t share the information with us because they don\u2019t trust us,\u201d the official said.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, a Russian offensive has been building since early January, according to Syrsky. Budanov, Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence chief, told The Post last month that Russia had more than 325,000 soldiers in Ukraine, and another 150,000 mobilized troops could soon join the fight. Ukrainian soldiers report being outnumbered and having less ammunition.</p>\n\n<p>The stakes for Ukraine in the coming months are particularly high, as Western countries aiding Kyiv look to see whether Ukrainian forces can once again seize the initiative and reclaim more territory from Russian control.</p>\n\n<p>Russia is also facing ammunition, manpower and motivation problems \u2014 and has notched only incremental gains in recent months despite the strained state of Ukraine\u2019s force. As bad as Ukraine\u2019s losses are, Russia\u2019s are worse, the U.S. official said.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe question is whether Ukraine\u2019s relative advantage is sufficient to attain their objectives, and whether those advantages can be sustained,\u201d said Michael Kofman, a military analyst at Virginia-based CNA. \u201cThat depends not just on them, but also on the West.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Despite reports of untrained mobilized Russian fighters being thrown into battle, Syrsky said those now arriving are well-prepared. \u201cWe have to live and fight in these realities,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s problematic for us. \u2026 It forces us to be more precise in our firing, more detailed in our reconnaissance, more careful in choosing our positions and more detailed in organizing the interaction between the units. There is no other way.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Russia\u2019s recent gains \u2014 notably around Bakhmut \u2014 have not significantly tilted the battlefield, and U.S. military officials have said that even if Russia seizes Bakhmut, it would be of little strategic importance. But given the heavy casualties Ukraine is suffering there, officials in Washington have questioned Kyiv\u2019s refusal to retreat. The United States has been advising Ukraine to retreat from the city since at least January, the U.S. official said.</p>\n\n<p>A Ukrainian official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly, said the battle for Bakhmut was depleting Russian forces there \u2014 mainly Wagner fighters who have been Moscow\u2019s most effective of late \u2014 and that Ukrainian units now defending the city were not slated to be deployed in upcoming offensive operations anyway.</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine has lost many of its junior officers who received U.S. training over the past nine years, eroding a corps of leaders who helped distinguish the Ukrainians from their Russian enemies at the start of the invasion, the Ukrainian official said.

Moscow wants to protect its northern trade routes and gain access to new fossil fuels and rare earth metal deposits as the ice melts due to climate change.\n\n>\u201cPart of it was establishing the ability to protect, monitor, and control all this new traffic that they\u2019re bringing in and all these resources that they want to develop,\u201d Pincus said. \u201cSo the Russian impulse to build up military capabilities in the Russian Arctic makes sense.\u201d\n\n>The Arctic is warming four times as fast as the rest of the world. Longer periods without ice mean increased marine traffic and potentially easier access to natural resources. About 90 billion barrels of undiscovered oil and 1,670 trillion cubic feet of undiscovered gas may lie inside the Arctic Circle, according to the United States Geological Survey, along with metals and minerals needed for electrification.\n\n>Last summer, both major shipping routes through the Arctic \u2014 Russia\u2019s Northern Sea Route and Canada\u2019s Northwest Passage \u2014 were essentially ice free all season. Climate scientists now predict the North Pole could be entirely ice-free by mid-century, opening a third Trans Arctic shipping route through international waters. This is seen as key to China\u2019s Arctic strategy, which includes a Polar Silk Road connecting East Asia, Western Europe and North America.\n\n>China, which has touted its \u201cno-limits\u201d partnership with Russia, declared itself in 2018 a \u201cnear-Arctic state.\u201d In addition to fishing, energy and transportation interests, China operates research stations in Norway and Iceland, and has pledged greater cooperation with Russia in the Arctic. The US alleges a Chinese spy balloon recently entered its airspace over Alaska before eventually being shot down by American forces over South Carolina.\n\n>Economic imperatives may yet deter Russia from pursuing conflict in the Arctic, Pincus said. \n\n>Still, greater proximity of military forces is inherently dangerous. NATO has boosted its own presence in the region, including through military exercises and a command opened in Norfolk, Virginia, in 2021 that\u2019s tasked with monitoring the Atlantic and High North, which includes areas both inside and outside of the Arctic circle.\n\n>In an op-ed in the Globe and Mail, which coincided with a visit to Canada last August, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned of China\u2019s Arctic ambitions, and of Russia\u2019s rising military activity in the region. \u201cRussia\u2019s ability to disrupt Allied reinforcements across the North Atlantic is a strategic challenge to the Alliance,\u201d he said. \n\n>Russia\u2019s highly advanced submarines pose one of the biggest challenges for the alliance in the Arctic, in particular because they are so hard to detect, maritime experts say. The Russian Navy commands an estimated 58 vessels, 11 of which are strategic nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines, according to the Nuclear Threat Initiative. That compares with the US\u2019s estimated 64 submarines, 14 of them ballistic missile submarines.\n\n>Underwater capability is an area where Russia can \u201cpresent a sort of asymmetric threat against a more powerful Western alliance,\u201d said the Norwegian Navy\u2019s Andersen. \n\n>\u201cThe threat of an unlocated Russian submarine transiting from the North through the GIUK gap is a chief concern for NATO allies and something that warrants close coordination and cooperation across the alliance,\u201d said Walter Berbrick, an associate professor at the US Naval War College\u2019s war gaming department and director of the Arctic Studies group. \n\n>NATO has responded by increasing underwater surveillance of the North Atlantic, with underwater sonar and maritime patrols by air. It\u2019s an area where Finland and Sweden will be able to aid allies by monitoring and sharing intelligence \u2014 and providing vital air power.\n\n>Scandinavia will have about 250 fighter jets, including 150 F-35s, with Finland and Sweden in the NATO tent, said Norwegian Colonel Eirik Guldvog, Commanding Officer of the 133 Air Wing at Elvenes Military Airbase, north of the Arctic Circle in Norway. That compares with around 900 fighter jets for Russia\u2019s air force, according to the World Directory of Modern Military Aircraft.\n\n>That\u2019s on top of the P-8A Poseidon aircraft \u2014 including two from the US \u2014 at the base that are used for maritime patrols, such as dropping sonar to look for submarines.\n\n>\u201cThis will be almost one air force, dealing with Scandinavia,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be quite a substantial air force.\u201d\n\n>The importance of that was underscored last week. Even as the NATO drills went on, officials in Germany scrambled two F-35s at Elvenes after radar detected unidentified objects to the north. Within an hour, the jets were back, having got a close look at two Russian IL-38 jets traveling through international airspace. \n\n>It happens about once a week, Guldvog said, and the aircraft are invariably Russian as its air force looks to soak up information in the Arctic about other countries.\n\n>Guldvog's station has the most intercepts each year, \u201cbecause Russia, to get to the Atlantic, they have to travel north of Norway and along our coast,\u201d he said.\n\n>\u201cWe see a lot of flying, of course, northwards towards Canada and the US over the North Pole.\u201d",

That compares with the US\u2019s estimated 64 submarines, 14 of them ballistic missile submarines.</p>\n\n<p>Underwater capability is an area where Russia can \u201cpresent a sort of asymmetric threat against a more powerful Western alliance,\u201d said the Norwegian Navy\u2019s Andersen. </p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe threat of an unlocated Russian submarine transiting from the North through the GIUK gap is a chief concern for NATO allies and something that warrants close coordination and cooperation across the alliance,\u201d said Walter Berbrick, an associate professor at the US Naval War College\u2019s war gaming department and director of the Arctic Studies group. </p>\n\n<p>NATO has responded by increasing underwater surveillance of the North Atlantic, with underwater sonar and maritime patrols by air. It\u2019s an area where Finland and Sweden will be able to aid allies by monitoring and sharing intelligence \u2014 and providing vital air power.</p>\n\n<p>Scandinavia will have about 250 fighter jets, including 150 F-35s, with Finland and Sweden in the NATO tent, said Norwegian Colonel Eirik Guldvog, Commanding Officer of the 133 Air Wing at Elvenes Military Airbase, north of the Arctic Circle in Norway. That compares with around 900 fighter jets for Russia\u2019s air force, according to the World Directory of Modern Military Aircraft.</p>\n\n<p>That\u2019s on top of the P-8A Poseidon aircraft \u2014 including two from the US \u2014 at the base that are used for maritime patrols, such as dropping sonar to look for submarines.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis will be almost one air force, dealing with Scandinavia,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be quite a substantial air force.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The importance of that was underscored last week. Even as the NATO drills went on, officials in Germany scrambled two F-35s at Elvenes after radar detected unidentified objects to the north. Within an hour, the jets were back, having got a close look at two Russian IL-38 jets traveling through international airspace. </p>\n\n<p>It happens about once a week, Guldvog said, and the aircraft are invariably Russian as its air force looks to soak up information in the Arctic about other countries.</p>\n\n<p>Guldvog&#39;s station has the most intercepts each year, \u201cbecause Russia, to get to the Atlantic, they have to travel north of Norway and along our coast,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe see a lot of flying, of course, northwards towards Canada and the US over the North Pole.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Furthermore, the myth of the Russian army as the 2nd best army in the world has been shattered for the entire world to see.

And even then, an in-depth look into the events of 1917 will show you that neither of the two revolutions had great popular support. \n\nRight now the war has caused a huge upsurge in Russian ethnocentrism and patriotism. Since talk of regime change is pretty much taboo even in opposition circles, I believe that unless changes are forced upon Russia externally, nothing will fundamentally change in the country and its society.

And even then, an in-depth look into the events of 1917 will show you that neither of the two revolutions had great popular support. </p>\n\n<p>Right now the war has caused a huge upsurge in Russian ethnocentrism and patriotism.
