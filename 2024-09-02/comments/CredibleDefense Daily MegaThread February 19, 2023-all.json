The unsatisfying answer is that we do not now what \"the mood\" is in Russia, because there is no working independent polling. Imagine US in 2020 at the height of the election controversy. Can you imagine **just there not being any trustworthy data** about how many people support Trump or Biden?\n\nStill, there are volunteers out there doing phone polling (see https://russianfield.com/yubiley, you might need Google Translate). The headline figure is: \"45% support the special military operation, 44% support suing for peace, 70% would approve if Putin signs a peace deal tomorrow\". What does this mean? Is the Russian society split 50:50? Is there a civil war brewing? Again, the unsatisfying answer is \"this is just noise\", because for every person who answered the pollsters' questions, there were **17** who declined to (increased from 13 in the previous poll). In other words, 94% are not comfortable saying what they think about the war.\n\nYou are right in the sense that there are definitely Russians who believe the propaganda nationalistic line, which you describe decently well (though I think it definitely misses the Nazi angle, it really is a big one. Also the entire USSR topic, and Ukraine having been a part of the same country in living memory. And the Donbass genocide). How many really, actually pro-war Russians are out there? They do exist, of course, and they play an important role. But do they hold important positions? Do they influence the other groups successfully? Will they stay this way forever? We **do not know**. Imagine you are an analyst at CIA tasked with estimating how easy it would be to stage a coup in Russia. What estimate would you come up with and why? What data would you need for a good answer?\n\nAnd to muddy the waters further, the mood where in Russia? I can guarantee that Moscow, medium cities like Cherepovets (pop 300k), and tiny villages in Siberia, experience the war _drastically differently_.\n\nWe don't know the answer, but we can guess based on incomplete data. I am relatively well informed about the topic, and I would say that there are 20% legitimately pro-war Russians, 10% emphatically anti-war Russians, and 70% \"I am not thrilled about the war, but I won't do anything to help either side, just leave me alone\" Russians.\n\nFor \"why aren't Russians protesting\", read [this comment of mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/10zn2wq/credibledefense_daily_megathread_february_11_2023/j85y0ws/).",

The 80s up until the early 2000s was a period of endless system shocks, one after another. I'm not just talking about the loss of national prestige, some ethereal metric, but the actual decrease in standards of living throughout all of Russia. Families went hungry, and people died for all sorts of reasons. While it was in no way as bad as the trauma of their grandparents, it was still lived trauma. Putin, as imperfect as he is, stabilized Russia.\n\nAnd if you're a grocer in Moscow or a city bureaucrat in Petersburg, how has the war really impacted you? At the basic level, the economic one: not much. The worst predictions did not come true (total economic collapse), and in fact, things are more or less stable (that being said, trending downwards long-term). On a level of national pride: you've gotten to see Russia poke the eye of perfidious America and her allies, and (according to Russian media) destroy the NATO-armed forces of Ukraine many times over. You may know someone who got mobilized or even killed/wounded--and that sucks--but at the end of the day, you keep faith in Putin. Putin set the ship right in the 90s, and enough patience remains in his grand national project to keep the war going for a lot longer.\n\nYou also have to consider who Russia is mobilizing. Russia's army comprises volunteers/mercs (so people who know what they are signing up for) and conscripted peoples from Russia's less populated regions. There is a huge ratio discrepancy between the people mobilized in Moscow versus the very distant oblasts in Siberia. The voting, politically conscious middle-class in Moscow and Petersburg simply don't know many of the conscripted. 100,000 Russians could have died by now, but if they're from regions like Tomsk or Surgut, do you really care? Imagine if America population centers were basically New York and Boston, with nothing larger than a million people in a city in Texas or CA. If 100,000 people died in a war who were from Utah or Nevada, would you care as much in that scenario? Likely not. And if you do--congrats, you would be the American equivalent of a liberal Nalvanyite--a small, feckless minority lost in the mire of apathy.",

Christopher Cavoli\u2019s comments go further than other administration officials.\n\n>The top U.S. general in Europe is quietly telling American lawmakers that giving Ukraine advanced Western equipment \u2014 such as F-16 fighter jets, drones, and long-range missiles \u2014 could help Kyiv rule the skies and bolster its own offensives against Russia.\n\n>In a Friday morning closed-door briefing with more than 10 senators and House members, Gen. Christopher Cavoli was asked if F-16 fighter jets would help Ukraine win the war against Russia. He responded: \u201cYes,\u201d according to five people in the room who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private session.\n\n>The F-16 question was part of a larger discussion over the conduct of the war and what Kyiv needs to succeed in its plans to go on the offensive, and blunt Russian offensives across hundreds of miles of front lines. Cavoli said Ukraine needs longer-range missiles to allow its forces to strike Russian positions from farther away, putting headquarters and rear supply lines at risk, which would help disrupt the Russian war machine inside Ukraine.\n\n>The general\u2019s answer goes further than previous public comments by top national security officials, who have said they haven\u2019t ruled out sending fighter jets in the future, but also note that air defenses are the most urgent current need.\n\n>Cavoli told the lawmakers at the Munich Security Conference that the U.S. and its allies should send the most advanced weapons they can part with to Ukraine. That included advanced aircraft, drones and missiles with ranges over 62 miles (100 kilometers), such as the Army Tactical Missile System. Those weapons would do a better job positioning Kyiv to repel Moscow\u2019s troops, Cavoli said.\n\n>The general, who serves as both the supreme allied commander for Europe and as head of U.S. European Command, argued that Ukraine needs more advanced weapons and equipment to \u201cenhance the deep fight,\u201d per one of five people. A second person said Cavoli believes the West should equip Ukraine to \u201creach further\u201d into Russian positions within Ukraine\u2019s border.\n\n>A spokesperson for the general didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\n>The remarks come as the transatlantic debate on whether to provide Kyiv with advanced aircraft has intensified.\n\n>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has long called for fighter jets, arguing that Ukrainian pilots are skilled enough to train on Western-made warplanes and control the skies despite Russia\u2019s air defenses. But President Joe Biden and some European leaders have so far rebuffed that request, saying that the provision of tanks and artillery are more important for the current phase of the war.\n\n>That stance has frustrated advocates of providing Ukraine with whatever the U.S. can afford to hand over. \u201cThe F-16s are an absolute must,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told reporters on the sidelines of the conference. He accused the White House of being \u201cslow on everything,\u201d adding, \u201cwhat you saw with the tanks is going to happen with the jets.\u201d\n\n>On Thursday, a bipartisan group of lawmakers sent a letter to Biden urging him to send F-16s right away, POLITICO reported.\n\n>Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), who met with Cavoli and Ukrainian leaders in Munich, said he supports identifying Ukrainian pilots and maintenance crews and bringing them to the United States for training.\n\n>\u201cIt is the right thing to do to come up with a plan to identify personnel to be trained, along with the maintainers and develop a syllabus\u201d on how to operate and repair the complex fourth-generation fighter plane. Kelly was not one of the five people who confirmed that Cavoli discussed sending more advanced weapons.\n\n>Kelly, a retired Navy pilot with combat experience, added that Ukrainians are interested in using the warplane to hit Russian air defense systems from far away, which would then allow other aircraft and drones to operate more freely across the country, particularly in the east and south where the fighting is concentrated.\n\n>The British government promised to train Ukrainians on NATO-standard aircraft, but didn\u2019t provide a timeline for when or if London would send those warplanes eastward.\n\n>\u201cThe first step in being able to provide advanced aircrafts is to have soldiers or aviators who are capable of using them,\u201d U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said last week while standing alongside Zelenskyy. \u201cWe need to make sure they are able to operate the aircraft they might eventually be using.\u201d\n\n>Both American and British officials continue to say that nothing is off the table.\n\n>Slovakia, meanwhile, is in talks with Ukraine about sending MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine. \u201cThe Ukrainian president asked me to deliver the MiGs. Now, because this official request has come, the process of negotiations can be started,\u201d Slovakian Prime Minister Eduard Heger said last week. \u201cOur MiGs can save innocent lives in Ukraine.\u201d\n\n>Cavoli spoke with his Ukrainian counterpart this week about what other military aid Kyiv needs. Also this week, allies started training Ukrainian troops on Leopard 2 and other tanks that Germany in January approved to be sent.\n\n>Any new, modern capability the Ukrainians receive will have a major impact on the fighting this year. Russian forces have stalled out in Donbas, launching costly attacks on Ukrainian lines that can be measured in feet rather than miles, and their poorly trained conscripts- and prisoners-turned-soldiers are struggling.\n\n>\u201cThe Russians will try to launch an offensive\u201d this spring, a NATO official said on the sidelines of the gathering. \u201cI don\u2019t know how effective they\u2019re going to be. I don\u2019t know how much different it\u2019s going to look than what everything else has looked like. \u2026 I don\u2019t know what else they can do.\u201d\n\n>That doesn\u2019t mean the Ukrainians will have an easy go of it.\n\n>\u201cPeople need to be aware that this is going to be a long fight,\u201d the official said. \u201cThis is a war. This is not a crisis. This is not some small incident somewhere that can be managed. This is not a skirmish. This is an all-out war.\u201d\n\nUnsure if this was posted yesterday, will delete if it was.",

But President Joe Biden and some European leaders have so far rebuffed that request, saying that the provision of tanks and artillery are more important for the current phase of the war.</p>\n\n<p>That stance has frustrated advocates of providing Ukraine with whatever the U.S. can afford to hand over. \u201cThe F-16s are an absolute must,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told reporters on the sidelines of the conference. He accused the White House of being \u201cslow on everything,\u201d adding, \u201cwhat you saw with the tanks is going to happen with the jets.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>On Thursday, a bipartisan group of lawmakers sent a letter to Biden urging him to send F-16s right away, POLITICO reported.</p>\n\n<p>Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), who met with Cavoli and Ukrainian leaders in Munich, said he supports identifying Ukrainian pilots and maintenance crews and bringing them to the United States for training.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt is the right thing to do to come up with a plan to identify personnel to be trained, along with the maintainers and develop a syllabus\u201d on how to operate and repair the complex fourth-generation fighter plane. Kelly was not one of the five people who confirmed that Cavoli discussed sending more advanced weapons.</p>\n\n<p>Kelly, a retired Navy pilot with combat experience, added that Ukrainians are interested in using the warplane to hit Russian air defense systems from far away, which would then allow other aircraft and drones to operate more freely across the country, particularly in the east and south where the fighting is concentrated.</p>\n\n<p>The British government promised to train Ukrainians on NATO-standard aircraft, but didn\u2019t provide a timeline for when or if London would send those warplanes eastward.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe first step in being able to provide advanced aircrafts is to have soldiers or aviators who are capable of using them,\u201d U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said last week while standing alongside Zelenskyy. \u201cWe need to make sure they are able to operate the aircraft they might eventually be using.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Both American and British officials continue to say that nothing is off the table.</p>\n\n<p>Slovakia, meanwhile, is in talks with Ukraine about sending MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine. \u201cThe Ukrainian president asked me to deliver the MiGs. Now, because this official request has come, the process of negotiations can be started,\u201d Slovakian Prime Minister Eduard Heger said last week. \u201cOur MiGs can save innocent lives in Ukraine.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Cavoli spoke with his Ukrainian counterpart this week about what other military aid Kyiv needs. Also this week, allies started training Ukrainian troops on Leopard 2 and other tanks that Germany in January approved to be sent.</p>\n\n<p>Any new, modern capability the Ukrainians receive will have a major impact on the fighting this year. Russian forces have stalled out in Donbas, launching costly attacks on Ukrainian lines that can be measured in feet rather than miles, and their poorly trained conscripts- and prisoners-turned-soldiers are struggling.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe Russians will try to launch an offensive\u201d this spring, a NATO official said on the sidelines of the gathering. \u201cI don\u2019t know how effective they\u2019re going to be. I don\u2019t know how much different it\u2019s going to look than what everything else has looked like. \u2026 I don\u2019t know what else they can do.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>That doesn\u2019t mean the Ukrainians will have an easy go of it.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cPeople need to be aware that this is going to be a long fight,\u201d the official said. \u201cThis is a war. This is not a crisis. This is not some small incident somewhere that can be managed. This is not a skirmish. This is an all-out war.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Unsure if this was posted yesterday, will delete if it was.</p>\n</div>",

Poor force quality, loss of junior officers, ammunition, and equipment constraints limit Russian offensive potential.\n>\nThe RU offensive consists of about 5-6 axes of attack focused on the Donbas. Rather than a major push along one part of the front, it is instead a series of distributed battles running north-south from Luhansk, to Bakhmut, and southern Donetsk.\n>\nRussian forces are attacking at Vuhledar, Marinka, Adviivka, Bakhmut (and Bilohorivka), Kreminna -> Lyman, with attempts to advance near Kupyansk. The offensive began in the last week of January with a Russian assault on Vuhledar.\n>\nThe battle for Vuhledar involves two NI brigades (155th, 40th), and has not gone well for the Russian military. RU units refilled with mobilized personnel seem to have lost a fair bit of their offensive edge, but I\u2019m not sure this is a \u2018failure to learn.\u2019\n>\nThe terrain outside of Vuhledar is very open, heavily mined, and covered by UA ATGM teams. It leaves RU forces few options for an assault. I also wonder if the Russian military may be short on specialized equipment for tasks like mine clearing.\n>\nAt Kreminna RU VDV seems to have made some incremental gains against UA positions. Depending on how that battle plays out it may force UA to abandon the Kreminna campaign or lead to see-saw battles in the forest west of the city.\n>\nThere\u2019s a growing likelihood that UA will withdraw from Bakhmut to another defensive line east of Slovyansk/Kramatorsk. The Russian military may then turn north and try to consolidate control up to the Donets river (including Bilohorivka).\n>\nRU forces have not had much success at Avdiivka or Marinka. This is another area that\u2019s seen months of fighting. The Russian offensive doesn\u2019t look like much of an offensive because it is playing out in areas that have previously seen unsuccessful Russian attacks.\n>\nAt this stage it doesn\u2019t seem that RU has employed reserves, and is likely using those units to replace casualties, or perhaps waiting for a breakthrough to exploit. That said, there\u2019s not much evidence of a larger additional RU force in the waiting.\n>\nI\u2019ve been skeptical that there is an additional \u2018spring offensive\u2019 looming. To conduct such an operation RU would likely need a second mobilization wave, in advance, which never took place. Predictions that 500k troops would be mobilized mid-January proved incorrect.\n>\nSenior US and NATO military officials [have begun saying](https://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/3298235/secretary-of-defense-lloyd-j-austin-iii-and-army-gen-mark-a-milley-chairman-joi/) much the same in recent days. There\u2019s a relative consensus that the Russian offensive to take the Donbas began some time ago, and its going about as expected given the state of the force.\n>\nMy best guess is Moscow will wait to see what comes of this offensive before proceeding with a second mobilization wave. I would not discount anything, but right now the RU offensive looks to yield mostly incremental gains that come at the expense of equipment and ammunition.\n>\nOne possibility is that after UA launches an offensive in the spring, RU will then choose to mobilize in the summer, an attempt another operation later. Given UA no longer enjoys a manpower advantage, RU strategy in 2023 could be to grind away at UA manpower.\n>\nRussian forces are expending artillery ammunition in this offensive which they will miss in the spring. The coming months will reveal the real situation in RU artillery ammo availability, which I expect is quite problematic, forcing them to ration.\n>\nThat said, Ukrainian forces may also have issues with artillery ammo and barrels. This remains a near to medium term challenge. Rosy assessments of Western ammo production potential over the long-term might not align well with UA requirements for the coming 6-12 months.\n>\nUA is better served absorbing the RU attack & exhausting RU offensive potential, then taking the initiative later this spring. Having expended ammunition, better troops, and equipment it could leave RU defense overall weaker.\n>\nMy impression is that Surovkin, who stabilized RU lines, preferred a defensive strategy, rebuilding the force, and preferring to defend against a Ukrainian offensive in the south. Then have RU forces launch an offensive later in the summer to try and capture the Donbas.\n>\nInstead, Gerasimov is exhausting the Russian armed forces with a feckless series of offensive operations, which may yield some gains, like Bakhmut, but unlikely to change the strategic picture. The second battle for the Donbas may once again leave RU forces vulnerable.\n>\nA spring offensive will still prove a difficult operation for UA. Russian mil now has enough manpower & reserves to avoid a depleted frontline as in Kharkiv. Kherson is an imperfect, but probably a better guide for how a future UA offensive may unfold.\n>\nWhether Western AFVs make much of a difference depends on employment and the timing of the UA offensive. Its possible, if UA waits for the force to absorb it in quantity, but I suspect this equipment will mostly serve to backfill losses from the next operation.\n>\nFor a bit more on this I would suggest tuning into [this WOTR podcast from yesterday.](https://warontherocks.com/2023/02/russias-winter-offensive/) We talk about the Russian offensive, key battles to watch, and how it could shape Ukraine\u2019s plans for the spring.",

                            "body": "Carrier based aviation has, since World War Two, been a vital component of seapower in a way it is not for land power. Sink the carriers and sea power is snipped, whereas you can only bomb land targets so much before the tonnage does nothing. To use your example of World War Two, the US dropped tons and tons of bombs on islands like Iwo. But the defenders didn\u2019t surrender until the land forces went in. Similar to what happened to Iraq in Desert Storm, tho obviously the Japanese resisted much longer. \n\nRegarding strategic war, it\u2019s important to recall that the decisive weapon in the economic war was the submarine. It cut Japan off from overseas imports leading to famine condition both in the home islands and in the occupied territories. The strategic air campaign eventually did cause the Japanese to surrender, but only after having become the first atomic war. The sea, air, and land war were all required to force Japan to surrender. \n\nIt is possible to use air power to destroy ground forces in the way you describe, it happened both to Germany in 1945 and North Korea in the summer of 1950. But there are important caveats. The strategic air war may have helped to enable victory, but it in itself didn\u2019t stop German tanks from reaching the front. American tactical air power *did* ultimately destroy the German air power, but only once short range fighters could attack into Germany with Impunity, largely beginning in the summer and fall of 1944. But this was only possible because ground forces had captured major airfields in France. And in 1950, carrier air power waged an interdiction campaign against Korean supply lines. But the crisis, and dissolution of the KPA, only occurred after the UN counterattack. Hard fighting still had to happen to destroy the KPA. And obviously this did little to end the war. \n\nLand power (and also seapower) needs air power to obtain freedom of maneuver and air power has to create the opportunities which land power relies on. But both are required. You can\u2019t hit every target, blow up every nest, knock out every convoy. Especially in a crowded environment where not every car or truck can or should be targeted. In Vietnam, air power seemed to hold the promise for cutting the Ho Chi Minh trail. The US used bombs, mines, defoliants, PGMs, and motion sensors to knock out the flow of supplies. But it didn\u2019t work, because often troops would just walk on foot at night. But really the trail was so sophisticated, operational security so tight, that the NVA even moved tanks carefully down the trail. And if you say, oh well it was terrain and technology, don\u2019t forget that nearly the same thing happened in the deserts of Iraq. \n\nAirPower is always seductive because it promises war on the cheap. But ultimately you always need the man in boots standing by the road.",

Sink the carriers and sea power is snipped, whereas you can only bomb land targets so much before the tonnage does nothing. To use your example of World War Two, the US dropped tons and tons of bombs on islands like Iwo. But the defenders didn\u2019t surrender until the land forces went in. Similar to what happened to Iraq in Desert Storm, tho obviously the Japanese resisted much longer. </p>\n\n<p>Regarding strategic war, it\u2019s important to recall that the decisive weapon in the economic war was the submarine. It cut Japan off from overseas imports leading to famine condition both in the home islands and in the occupied territories. The strategic air campaign eventually did cause the Japanese to surrender, but only after having become the first atomic war. The sea, air, and land war were all required to force Japan to surrender. </p>\n\n<p>It is possible to use air power to destroy ground forces in the way you describe, it happened both to Germany in 1945 and North Korea in the summer of 1950. But there are important caveats. The strategic air war may have helped to enable victory, but it in itself didn\u2019t stop German tanks from reaching the front. American tactical air power <em>did</em> ultimately destroy the German air power, but only once short range fighters could attack into Germany with Impunity, largely beginning in the summer and fall of 1944. But this was only possible because ground forces had captured major airfields in France. And in 1950, carrier air power waged an interdiction campaign against Korean supply lines. But the crisis, and dissolution of the KPA, only occurred after the UN counterattack. Hard fighting still had to happen to destroy the KPA. And obviously this did little to end the war. </p>\n\n<p>Land power (and also seapower) needs air power to obtain freedom of maneuver and air power has to create the opportunities which land power relies on. But both are required. You can\u2019t hit every target, blow up every nest, knock out every convoy. Especially in a crowded environment where not every car or truck can or should be targeted. In Vietnam, air power seemed to hold the promise for cutting the Ho Chi Minh trail. The US used bombs, mines, defoliants, PGMs, and motion sensors to knock out the flow of supplies. But it didn\u2019t work, because often troops would just walk on foot at night. But really the trail was so sophisticated, operational security so tight, that the NVA even moved tanks carefully down the trail. And if you say, oh well it was terrain and technology, don\u2019t forget that nearly the same thing happened in the deserts of Iraq. </p>\n\n<p>AirPower is always seductive because it promises war on the cheap. But ultimately you always need the man in boots standing by the road.</p>\n</div>",

The MiG-21, due to it's pencil thin design is basically forever stuck as a short range interceptor with a short range missile. Yeah a lot of Eastern aligned air forces had them in high numbers until the 90's but beyond the early 1970's it only really existed as a western Ace-maker whereas the Phantom was still going pretty strong.\n\nIf they had just added room for a proper long range radar upgrade, a bit more fuel and a couple more hardpoints  it could have stayed very relevant more like the similar sized F-5 did.
