      "selftext": "The r/CredibleDefense daily megathread is for asking questions and posting submissions that would not fit the criteria of our post submissions. As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster. Don't abuse it though! If something is not obviously against the rules but you still feel that it should be reviewed, leave a short but descriptive comment while filing the report.",

We know there are at least 3 and at least two of them are manned (probably not to the same standards, but still, getting into Russia's rear is going to be more complicated than defeating a small QRF). \n\nI also think he overestimates the pace of potential advance. A dash of 90km to the Russian rear is implausible, the Kharkiv offensive *only* managed half that. \n\nIt also assumes russian forces are completely static. They do have reserve brigades in the area that can slow down Ukraine.\n\nAnother thing is that a lot of defensive lines are anchored on urban areas, meaning that to advance, Ukraine is going to need to either fight through, or compel Russia to retreat from these areas.

Michael \u201cErik\u201d Kurilla, the top commander of US forces in the Middle East, described the first Red Sands counter-drone experimentation exercise as \u201cvery successful.\u201d\n\n>But not everything went smoothly \u2014 and that was the point.\n\n>One Saudi-owned defense system proved unable to engage at the necessary range, forcing soldiers to improvise. Other weapons hit the targets successfully, including LIDS (Low, Slow, Unmanned Aircraft Integrated Defeat System) and Coyote counter-drone systems brought in by the US Army.\n\n>\u201cEverything that we're trying to do is to enhance the capabilities we have,\u201d Kurilla explained. \u201cIt\u2019s helping make our partners better as well.\u201d\n\n>Kurilla, who took the helm at Central Command (CENTCOM) last year at the onset of a two-decade low in the US military\u2019s footprint in the Middle East, said he wants to raise the stakes during the next Red Sands event in September.\n\n>\u201cMaybe we\u2019ll invite one or two other countries,\u201d Kurilla suggested. \u201cWe want to make sure we get it right on the first two iterations.\"\n\n>The goal is to build US and Saudi air defenders\u2019 confidence by further layering their systems and running multiple-drone scenarios from several angles to simulate complex attacks \u2014 such as the one that Iran launched against Saudi Aramco facilities in 2019 \u2014 before bringing in additional new systems like directed energy weapons.\n\n>Ultimately, US Army officials at CENTCOM intend to link their FAAD-C2 command-and-control nodes with artificial intelligence to help commanders prioritize targets, Kurilla said.\u00a0\n\n>But first the military needs to understand which of the dozens of counter-drone weapons on the market work best in certain scenarios. Three years after the Pentagon set up a dedicated office to explore counter-drone technology, the Army is still weighing which platforms to adopt to fight off threats like Iran's one-way Shahed-136 series.\n\n>In November, the Biden administration approved the first sale ever of US-made counter-drone systems to the Middle East, consisting of Raytheon Coyotes and FS-LIDS systems to Qatar, in the first sign of a glacial shift in US arms sales to the region. The United Arab Emirates formally requested to buy the LIDS system nearly two years ago, Breaking Defense reported in February.\n\n>Red Sands is just one of several initiatives drawn up by new leadership at CENTCOM through which US and Middle Eastern troops have been\u00a0field-testing emerging tech\u00a0to contribute to the Pentagon's race to modernize amid strategic competition with China and Russia.\u00a0\n\n>Kurilla's strategy, which he dubs \"people, partners and innovation,\" also aims to\u00a0compensate\u00a0for the reduction of American military assets in the region while assuaging a perceived crisis of faith in Gulf capitals over Washington\u2019s commitment to their security against Iran.\n\n>The Islamic Republic had already assembled the Middle East\u2019s largest drone and missile arsenal by the time the Trump administration abandoned diplomatic restraints on Tehran\u2019s nuclear program in 2018.\u00a0Many of the IRGC\u2019s projectiles are adept at outwitting the US-made air defense systems that dot the Arabian peninsula.\n\n>For that reason, Kurilla sees the region as the ideal theater for honing new tools in the arms race spurred by unmanned weapons \u2013 especially now that the threat of\u00a0Iran's drones has spread to Europe\u00a0and may soon be enhanced by Russian technology.\n\n>But a bevy of obstacles to US sales of counter-drone systems to the Middle East \u2013 coupled with recent years' withdrawals of US air defense systems \u2013 have only encouraged Gulf states\u2019 intent to diversify their foreign arms purchases and to\u00a0deepen ties with China, analysts and former officials say.\n\n>The CENTCOM chief and his staff are pressing ahead with their strategy\u00a0amid skepticism in the Pentagon that last month\u2019s Beijing-brokered agreement between Tehran and Riyadh to restore diplomatic ties will reduce the threat.\n\n>Kurilla acknowledges the geopolitical headwinds are significant.

These, though, are of the Soviet T varieties. The Leopard 2, considered to be one of the world\u2019s very best main battle tanks, is larger than the T-72 and features superior optical capabilities (including at night). It can hit targets from a distance of 8,000 meters, while the T-72 only has a range of 3,000 to 5,000 meters.\n\n\u201cDue to the urgency of the war, we\u2019re doing our standard Norwegian course at a higher tempo, which we thought would be a challenge; but I\u2019ve never seen a more motivated group of people!\u201d Thomas told me. \u201cThey really understand what we\u2019re training them in. A few of them have been fighting in this war since 2014, and many others since the early months of 2022. They\u2019re very good at acquiring new knowledge.\u201d\n\nThe tank uses a four-person crew, so that means the instructors have 28 pupils at a time. The tank school does indeed take place at a rapid tempo. \u201cFive weeks, Monday to Saturday, dawn to dusk,\u201d Thomas explained. \u201cThe soldiers obviously already have combat experience, and they have experience using Soviet-era tanks. That\u2019s an advantage. Our job is to retrain them, to help them forget the Soviet T-72s and T-64s and learn to use the Leopard.\u201d\n\nThe five-week course ends with a live-fire exercise\u2014a litmus test of how successful the training has been. **In the first course, the soldiers achieved an astonishing 93 percent accuracy. An informal poll I conducted found that non-Ukrainian Leopard 2 trainees over the years have typically achieved an average of 90 percent.** Such results, combined with the Leopards\u2019 better power and performance compared to the T-model tanks, will bring the Ukrainian armed forces tangible advantages.\n\nThe second group now undergoing training at the Leopard training center appears equally skilled. There are another 28 soldiers\u2014crews for another seven Leopards. The 100 donated Leopard 2 tanks are an impressive number, certainly compared to the zero Leopard donations made by the end of 2022. **But Ukraine says that in order to counter Russia\u2019s next offensive, it needs some 200 or 300 Leopards.**",

During the first days of the war, Russian vehicles ran out of fuel and troops ran out of food. The push towards Kyiv that turned into a traffic jam is an early example, as were the recent complaints by Wagner and others about a lack of resupply with artillery ammunition at the front. There were also the constant reports of lacking equipment for newly mobilised soldiers, both in Russia and at the front. We've heard reports that evacuation of Russian casualties are very slow or don't happen at all.\n\nI don't think that anyone can argue that Russia has, from the first day of the war to today, had massive problems resupplying armed forces that are barely a hundred kilometers from their own borders, while being able to use a rail networks. They may have been able to adapt and improve somewhat, but we're starting at over at day one on this: Russia hasn't supplied anything in this war by ship.

The journey is less than hour. That means it's 3 hours for a round trip and there are two piers on each side. Add a few additional ships to cover maintenance and you can easily run 24 trips a day.

Let's call it 60kg for packaging. The ferries could move closing in on one million shells per day. Just the ferries. For reference, a million shells is equivalent of about THREE MONTHS supply for the total Russian expenditure per day across the entire front.\n\nIn four days, a beefed-up ferry service could provide an entire years worth of artillery shells for the entire war.\n\nAre you bothering to think critically about this, or do any math at all?\n\n>250 kilometers from the front line positions\n\nAh, so now it's about distance?

            "body": "One thing that we tend to discount here in the West is just how Chinese Taiwan truly is. I'm not just speaking about the centuries of colonization dating back to the Ming & Qing periods (where many indigenous were wiped out, culturally assimilated, or intermarried with settlers), but about recent history: the civil war. Over a million people fled the mainland by 1949. These people left behind family, property, friends--a whole life behind--and they had a huge desire to see Taiwan (or the Republic of China) return victorious to the mainland. Even as this vanguard population died off, their offspring still have mainland ties--and even if they don't, the basic building blocks of national identity (language, culture, recent history) are still strong enough to make that vision of a reunited Taiwan with the mainland a tangible vision.\n\nThe population knows that the cost for an independent Taiwan will be high (a war with the mainland is one where few are certain about a Taiwanese victory), and for what gains, if they win? Taiwan not only wants to trade relations with its biggest neighbor but I'd say it's a deep psychological need as well. What people on both sides of the strait want is what they had before the civil war and Dutch/Japanese conquest: the relatively free and frictionless internal trade of persons and goods across the strait.\n\nThe only real reason many oppose a reunification under the red banner of the Communist Party is just that: to oppose the Communist Party. Is that enough, however, to induce the population to fight to the death? I'd wager no. Not only do Taiwanese people get to witness daily a little over a billion people live relatively normal lives (thus reducing the fear of the Communist Party), but they, like everyone everywhere, knows that governments are universally corrupt and make terrible decisions. Taiwan's ruling parties can be just as cynical, just as corrupt, as the most corrupt provinces in China. Bottom line: if you have to be ruled by a corrupt government, regardless, why not avoid the bloodshed and seek the outcome where peace and free trade is reestablished with the mainland?\n\nOf course, Taiwan is not a monolith. There are fervent liberals who would rather die than surrender the accumulated unique freedoms that the Taiwenese people have accumulated. There are others who want closer integration, not with China, but with Japan and America. And there are indigenous nationalists: both indigenous peoples (who first settled pre-Ming), and descendants of the later settlers, who view themselves more as Taiwanese and less as Chinese.\n\nBut the question posed was: why won't all of Taiwan fight to the death for independence, like Ukraine is doing? The answer is that Ukraine is not Taiwan. Taiwan, in the Russian context would be akin to Kaliningrad: a place where most everyone is Russian, where even if Kaliningrad were peeled off Russia, it would be impossible to see that strip of land declare permanent independence from Russia (without mass population transfers).\n\nSometimes, I feel like Americans want Taiwanese independence more than Taiwanese people themselves do. After all, to what extent have we considered this scenario: after decades and billions of dollars, Taiwan quickly falls to the mainland's invasion forces within a month, with most units disintegrating on first contact with hostiles. If that does happen: what are we all doing here? What's the point in fighting for something even the primary benefactors are mostly ambivalent towards? In other words: if Taiwan is going to just shrug and accept mainland domination, why should we stand in the way, if our commitment is just going to cause a massive disruption in trade and the deaths of our own servicemembers, to say nothing of the diplomatic chaos this would rend?\n\nUkraine, at least, has made a convincing argument that they will fight and die for their freedom. But Taiwan? Outside a vocal few, most do seem ambivalent if not eager for a return to normal strait relations. Of course, this could be a total misread, and once an invasion starts, everyone could rally to the flag. Or it could be a Hong Kong: outside a very vocal few, most people just shrug and go on with their lives.\n\nThe only reason, as America, to oppose Taiwanese reintegration with China is to prevent Chinese power projection in the Pacific. This fear, I think, is borne from overlearning the lessons of WW2 and the Cold War. To deal with the latter first, China is not the Soviet Union. They have little desire to export their revolution outwards, and are more than happy to deal with any government, from princes and kings to Presidents and Prime Ministers, as long as it is a mutually beneficial trade. You can see this mostly in how they fund foreign Communist parties: they really don't. They could afford to, and yet they mostly avoid intrigues like that. And on that note, they don't have expansive Japanese or Hitlerite ambitions as far as anyone can tell. They have realized, much like every other nation since 1945, that you can get a lot more from other territories through trade, concessions, and investment than you could through outright conquest.\n\nIn other words: there's nothing for us to really contain or appease. Their manner of dominating foreign countries is much the same as ours: using investment banks, law firms, and well-trained professionals to secure stable supply chains for use back home. A PRC version of the World Bank may sound scary, but at the end of the day, it would be little scarier than the Western-aligned, original World Bank.\n\nAnd realistically, where could China go after Taiwan? The North is desolate Siberia (maybe less desolate with climate change, but we're still decades out from that bearing fruit), the West and South are bounded by supremely defenseible mountains, deserts, and jungle, and only the East (Korea, Japan, and outlying islands) remains as the tangible target. Of those, only tiny skirmishes in far-off islands against the US navy would be the likely flashpoints. Beijing is more than happy to deal with Seoul and Tokyo, even if they are dominated by Western-aligned capitalists. That may change and they may go ham with full cominternism, but we shouldn't base our policy on what might be, but what is. And what China is today is a normal, post-Soviet state with a government that doesn't look or sound like a Western one. We should, absent war, treat it like one (see: Vietnam).",

The universal truth is that every government in the world will be corrupt and make mistakes (on purpose and on accident), and the level that corruption happens will fluctuate over time. Regimes, after all, are not measured in years but in decades and centuries. America is seen as the bastion of law and order, with little patience for official corruption, but literally no one thinks seriously that corruption in America has been solved or that we won't ever have to deal with malign influences ever again. \n\nTaiwan has certainly improved and is better today, but up until the 80s, they were a brutal authoritarian dictatorship that massacred dissidents. Even if that never returns, it's guaranteed that there are self-dealers & greedy officials in the Taiwanese state and government *right now*. For instance, here's a story from last year about vote buying: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.voanews.com/amp/taiwan-struggles-to-shake-off-era-of-corruption-in-local-politics/6846530.html\n\nI'm not saying that this means the self-determination of Taiwan isn't worth fighting for, but rather that the Taiwanese government is imperfect (like all governments), and because of that, and because many in Taiwan see themselves as an integral part of China (and vice versa) it all adds up to mean that they are less willing to fight for Taiwan. That's not PRC propaganda, that is stated fact. Of course, there will be many in Taiwan that will fight and die for free speech, free elections, and their unique political system. I accepted as much in my original post. But I think a large portion of society, when confronted by the prospect of takeover by the PRC, will just shrug and go: \"new boss, same as the old boss.\"\n\nPerhaps I was callous and cynical in my first post, describing some parts of Taiwan as corrupt as the mainland. That is conjecture on my part. But based on we in America treat corruption, and how other nations in the region deal with it (South Korea's Presidents have for the most part all been arrested for some corrupt crime or other), it isn't wild to assume that Taiwan also has corruption, and also corruption we don't necessarily hear about (our own domestic news is rife with just-discovered stories about ethical violations with a member of the Supreme Court--violations that have been going for 25 years).\n\nAgain, we're trying to answer why everyone in Taiwan isn't gung-ho about a war. If you remove bog-standard cowardice (a feature in any potential war), you're left with either apathy or treason. I doubt there are more than a handful of true, out-and-out traitors in Taiwanese society (people who would welcome mainland troops with open arms), so that leaves apathy as the only other plausible conclusion. Why apathy then? Well: that's what I tried to answer. I might be wrong about my conclusions, but we can't ignore the fact that there is an apathetic contingent of Taiwanese society. Or, maybe we can. Ignorance has suited us just fine in the past. Just don't be surprised when, after ignoring this issue, we have to do yet another rooftop embassy evacuation, this time in Taipei.",

It also remains supersonic out to about 1500 yards where .308 stays supersonic out to about 1200 yards. At 1000 yards, the .308 bullet drop is -412 inches compared to -292 inches for the .277 fury. Wind drift will also be significantly better in the .277 fury. \n\nGranted, is it world changing? No. But if you want to shoot long range, you take the .277 fury every time. Not the .308. Any drift or drop make shooting long range difficult. \n\nThe only real downside of .277 fury is it is more expensive and they'll burn out barrels faster. .308 is known to last a long time (like 10k or more rounds) where .277 fury will probably be closer to 5000 rounds (I'm guessing).

It also remains supersonic out to about 1500 yards where .308 stays supersonic out to about 1200 yards. At 1000 yards, the .308 bullet drop is -412 inches compared to -292 inches for the .277 fury. Wind drift will also be significantly better in the .277 fury. </p>\n\n<p>Granted, is it world changing? No. But if you want to shoot long range, you take the .277 fury every time. Not the .308. Any drift or drop make shooting long range difficult. </p>\n\n<p>The only real downside of .277 fury is it is more expensive and they&#39;ll burn out barrels faster. .308 is known to last a long time (like 10k or more rounds) where .277 fury will probably be closer to 5000 rounds (I&#39;m guessing).

Since airborne radar can detect low flying cruise missiles much further away, they can cover about 200 miles of line. Each air defense system can only cover maybe 10-20 miles. \n\nSo for the same 200 miles you can cover with maybe 14 jets (2 down for maintenance, 4 hour shifts) flying rotating pairs of CAP with probably 14 pilots. Probably twice? that many for maintenance, so around 50 people. Maybe twice that in other support roles, so 100 total. For ground defense, you'd need 10-20 air defense systems constantly manned. Typical systems need 4 people, so you'd need 80-160 trained crew members. Probably at least that many for maintenance. So for ground, you are looking at 160-320 people. \n\nOf course, this excludes the cost of training. Aircraft mechanics and pilots are way more expensive than air defense crews and truck mechanics. But, jets are more flexible. F16s can do close air support missions or ferry bombs, where air defense can only do anti-air. \n\nIt's a complicated problem, but I'm certain F16s will be useful to Ukraine.
