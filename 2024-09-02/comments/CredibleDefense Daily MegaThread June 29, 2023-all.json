As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

I'll be absolutely shocked if we actually see a T-54 in combat (i.e. in a direct fire support role as it was intended). These are artillery platforms used for pre-sighted point defense, nothing more. Video shown today of a single tanker manning a T-54 and shoving spent casings out the open top is all the proof of this you need.\n\nWhat we should be asking is why they feel the need for this. A T-54 in indirect fire would have a CEP well outside of reliability. It's so patently ill suited for this role that you might as well label it stochastic artillery. This leads me to suspect Russian 152 and 122 artillery is encountering a bottleneck somewhere. Shell production? Shell delivery to the front? Ability to deliver reinforcements? Barrels? Trained crew? Who knows, but someone somewhere is uncomfortable with their concentration of artillery, and this is their solution.",

However, during the years of the war in Donbas, the tankers of the UAF changed traditional approaches and developed techniques for indirect fire. For this task, high-explosive fragmentation projectiles are usually used. This requires the use of special guidance devices \u2013 an azimuth pointer and a side level. The use of modern technologies, in the form of graphic and calculation complexes, developed in Ukraine with the function of automated transmission of information to other  \n>  \n>tanks participating in the combat mission, **made it possible to  achieve high accuracy at distances of up to 10 km** and reduced the time for calculating fire corrections to a few seconds. This technique blurs the line between tanks and artillery.

However, during the years of the war in Donbas, the tankers of the UAF changed traditional approaches and developed techniques for indirect fire. For this task, high-explosive fragmentation projectiles are usually used. This requires the use of special guidance devices \u2013 an azimuth pointer and a side level. The use of modern technologies, in the form of graphic and calculation complexes, developed in Ukraine with the function of automated transmission of information to other  </p>\n\n<p>tanks participating in the combat mission, <strong>made it possible to  achieve high accuracy at distances of up to 10 km</strong> and reduced the time for calculating fire corrections to a few seconds. This technique blurs the line between tanks and artillery. The value of this technique is that it allows tanks to concentrate fire over a wide area while they can manoeuvre without the protection and screening needed by artillery pieces. Ukraine therefore planned to use armour as mobile reserves supporting its formations, capable of offering blunting fire against enemy movements and to support counterattacks if conditions permitted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I wonder how you are gonna dismiss RUSI.</p>\n</div>",

Keeping certain things off the table was keeping things in their back pockets as leverage, even if implicitly, in negotiations. As *Realpolitik* as it is, you give Ukraine everything on day 1 and you have nothing for Russia to fear you'll give them.

As beaten to death a topic that it is, a very real worry of retaliation & escalation from Russia. The *\"I'm not touching you, I'm not touching you!*\" approach might be frustrating, but the US has (imo, somewhat masterfully) made it a mundane affair for Russia to make lines in the sand and then casually cross them. If you throw all but the kitchen sink at Ukraine at once, it's one giant affair and that shock might just incur retaliation.

Cheng visited key Japanese companies to hold discussions on important issues such as strengthening Taiwan\u2019s semiconductor supply chains, the statement added, without naming the firms. Taiwan\u2019s export orders plummeted in May for a ninth straight month amid a global slide in demand for chips. \n\n>Cheng said in a Facebook post that he met Taro Aso, a former prime minister of Japan and now vice president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. They held \u201cin-depth discussions on Taiwan-Japan economic and trade exchanges, industrial cooperation and strengthening Taiwan-Japan relations,\u201d he said.\n\n>Cheng also met Toshimitsu Motegi, the LDP\u2019s secretary general and a potential future candidate for prime minister, public broadcaster NHK reported.\n\n>The visit risks once again angering China, which opposes Taiwan having official contacts with nations it has diplomatic ties with. China filed a diplomatic protest with Japan after Vice President Lai Ching-te traveled to Japan for the funeral of former leader Shinzo Abe last year. Beijing also raised its concern over Japan boosting defense spending so it can toughen its security posture amid what it sees as rising threats from China, North Korea and Russia.\n\n>Beijing is also likely to be upset by a group of US lawmakers arriving in Taipei. Mike Rogers, chair of House Armed Services Committee, said during a meeting with President Tsai Ing-wen on Wednesday that the visit by the delegation of Republicans and Democrats showed that US backing for Taiwan was \u201cbipartisan and unwavering.\u201d\n\n>Tsai thanked the US Congress for its concern for Taiwan\u2019s security and expressing support through concrete actions. \n\n>China has been wooing Taiwan\u2019s opposition Kuomintang in the run-up to a presidential election in Taiwan next year because it sees the party as a more congenial negotiating partner. It views the ruling Democratic Progressive Party as an obstacle to Taiwan someday coming under its control.\n\n>During his visit to Japan, which wraps up Thursday, Cheng was joined by executives from tech companies such as Lite-On Technology Corp. and Wistron Corp., the Cabinet statement added.

Now, some of these information are unknown or impossible to know at the moment. However, there are certain maths that we can work backwards from the known outcome.\n\nFor example, in ATP 5-0.2-1, Staff Reference Guide Volume I Unclassified Resources, 2020, on page 219, there is a table for \"brigade and below opposed rates of advance (km/hr). Against a prepared defense (defender position prepared for more than 24 hours), in unrestricted terrain, mounted rate of advance is 0.6 km/hr against intense resistance (1:1 attacker:defender COF), 1.2 km/hr against heavy resistance (3:1 COF), and 1.5 km/hr against light resistance (5:1 COF). Against a hasty defence, the rate is 1 km/hr for intense resistance, 2 km/hr for heavy resistance, and 2.6 km/hr for light resistance.\n\nSo if the attacker advance only like 5 km per day, assuming 8 hours of fighting, the latest planning assumptions will put that as meeting intense resistance. If they meet light resistance, it will be more like 12 km. The Ukraininan rate of advance is consistent with meeting intense resistance.\n\nAlso, another thing that doesn't make sense in your writing is this: if there is a fixing attack, where's the main attack? In the classical [Soviet Deep Battle](https://www.routledge.com/Soviet-Military-Operational-Art-In-Pursuit-of-Deep-Battle/Glantz/p/book/9780714640778) attack formation (which both Ukrainian and Russian officers have some inheritance from), for a typical formation (let's say it's a division) of 4 subordinate units (four motor-rifle regiments), they would divide the attack sector into two halves. Then the 1st regiment will attack on one half, 2nd and 3rd regiments will attack on the line on the other half, with the 4th regiment as the reserve. 1st is the fixing attack to fix the enemy on half of the attacking sector while the 2nd and 3rd have only half the frontage of the 1st, meaning they can achieve better correlation of forces; these are your main attack. If the main and fixing attacks are not launched simultaneously or at least very close to one another there's really no meaning to having specifically fixing or main attack.\n\nI'll admit that it can be difficult to ascertain the planning intentions with what transpires in reality. Eg., you can plan fixing and main attacks all you want, but then the enemy collapses unexpectedly and all axes surge forward. Was that a broad front attack or a cleverly planned attack? What if you were judging the enemy incorrectly and then despite all the clever planning to create favourable COF, both axes stall but you cannot halt the attack since doing do will let the enemy shifts his forces away from your sector and endanger the guys to your left and right, so you throw in the reserve intended for exploitation to the grinding battle and in the process destroy your brigade.

Commanders when writing orders are supposed to write about the situations of the friendly units two levels up. They can and do know the operational plans; if the Ukrainians are the fabled &quot;trained by NATO&quot;. Soviet orders tend to go only one level up but the advantage is that they can write faster orders compared to American-style orders. So a battalion CO should at least know the division plan and a brigade CO will know the Corp plan. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>nor does \u201cblowing each other up\u201d constitute part of operational art.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Again, this is if you buy the American &quot;maneuver&quot; doctrine, which they themselves don&#39;t even follow.</p>\n</div>",

There are ways to set up production that can be useful for making both, but that's so inefficient it's better kept for low volumes or prototyping.\n\nArtillery shells are typically forged out of round stock steel and then heat treated, whose main expensive and specialized tool is of course a hydraulic press with a suitable and usable die, as well as the heat treatment line to some extent.

The mere fact that Surovikin came out and \"pledged loyalty\" is incredibly bad. Generals don't go around and pledge loyalty. Loyalty is expected.

The mere fact that Surovikin came out and &quot;pledged loyalty&quot; is incredibly bad. Generals don&#39;t go around and pledge loyalty. Loyalty is expected.

His best contributions are genuinely insightful and the worst ones don't hurt.\n\nIf you look in his history, Glideer shares many things about Russian incompetence too, which are received well. Recently: he posted about pre-WWII shells: https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/14m35ad/credibledefense_daily_megathread_june_29_2023/jpznu21/ multiple articles about the longer term nature of split between Russia and the West e.g. https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/14l7lw0/credibledefense_daily_megathread_june_28_2023/jpz4rq2/ a T-80 commander talking about 50 year old optics, low morale etc. https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/14l7lw0/credibledefense_daily_megathread_june_28_2023/jpwja7l/ Chinese shells (showing Russian industry can't keep up) https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/14kbs3y/credibledefense_daily_megathread_june_27_2023/jprux5u/\n\n-------------\n\nFor this post in particular, there are quite a few reports. But in context, Russian forces have been failing to remove the bridgehead, have been getting desperate, calling for a more strategic response - and only got a single missile. I don't see how that's wildly cheerleading the Russian side. If the missile hit or not is irrelevant to the bigger story (no one said the bridge was destroyed etc.) It seems that many users are upset reading anything which doesn't have a pro-Ukrainian disclaimer clarifying how something helps - even if in context and essence it is showing Ukrainian success.\n\nTo be clear, please do report low quality contributions. I personally like to remove a comments to increase the thread's information density for readers with little time. I am happy to remove half of Glideer or any other user's contributions - but banning them would stop the flow of insightful ones. If you guys really want Glideer gone, **write better submission statements and insightful posts** so the sub's inundated with high quality contributions and they weigh less heavily in favor of problematic users.",

Recently: he posted about pre-WWII shells: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/14m35ad/credibledefense_daily_megathread_june_29_2023/jpznu21/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/14m35ad/credibledefense_daily_megathread_june_29_2023/jpznu21/</a> multiple articles about the longer term nature of split between Russia and the West e.g. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/14l7lw0/credibledefense_daily_megathread_june_28_2023/jpz4rq2/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/14l7lw0/credibledefense_daily_megathread_june_28_2023/jpz4rq2/</a> a T-80 commander talking about 50 year old optics, low morale etc. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/14l7lw0/credibledefense_daily_megathread_june_28_2023/jpwja7l/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/14l7lw0/credibledefense_daily_megathread_june_28_2023/jpwja7l/</a> Chinese shells (showing Russian industry can&#39;t keep up) <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/14kbs3y/credibledefense_daily_megathread_june_27_2023/jprux5u/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/14kbs3y/credibledefense_daily_megathread_june_27_2023/jprux5u/</a></p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>For this post in particular, there are quite a few reports. But in context, Russian forces have been failing to remove the bridgehead, have been getting desperate, calling for a more strategic response - and only got a single missile. I don&#39;t see how that&#39;s wildly cheerleading the Russian side. If the missile hit or not is irrelevant to the bigger story (no one said the bridge was destroyed etc.) It seems that many users are upset reading anything which doesn&#39;t have a pro-Ukrainian disclaimer clarifying how something helps - even if in context and essence it is showing Ukrainian success.</p>\n\n<p>To be clear, please do report low quality contributions. I personally like to remove a comments to increase the thread&#39;s information density for readers with little time. I am happy to remove half of Glideer or any other user&#39;s contributions - but banning them would stop the flow of insightful ones. If you guys really want Glideer gone, <strong>write better submission statements and insightful posts</strong> so the sub&#39;s inundated with high quality contributions and they weigh less heavily in favor of problematic users.</p>\n</div>",
