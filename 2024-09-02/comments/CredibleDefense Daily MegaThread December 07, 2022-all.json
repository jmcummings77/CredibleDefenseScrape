This was intended for US & export production, including Bahrain, Poland, and Romania. No word on numbers, but initial production numbers must have been low because that would have to be split between new and old missiles. According to [this page](https://asc.army.mil/web/portfolio-item/atacms/) a contract has been issued every year since 2017 for more missiles, though I bet the contract in 2018 was in support of the modernization package which as you see was also tested in 2018. Successful test leads to another order for modernized missiles. But in 2018 and now 2022&2023 it seems like orders were placed for new missiles. \n\nSo I wonder where this leaves production and stockpile numbers. As others have stated PRSM wont tick up till 2025 at the earliest, so was LockMart really in full swing production before this year, or just focusing on extending the service life of existing missiles and making them ready for export? Very interesting regardless.",

I frankly doubt every one of those flights is fully loaded, and this doesn't even scratch the surface of trying to guess how many flights are required to load howitzers, armored vehicles, small arms, ATGMs, etc. Not an exaggeration to suggest that there have been literally thousands of flights to Ramstein AB or locations in Poland carrying weapons to Ukraine. Anecdotally, I've read anecdotes from people on /r/AirForce complaining about the ops temp at Ramstein over the last year. Outside of this subreddit there's a popular image that giving Ukraine our gear is almost trivially easy just because we have so much sitting around. Nothing could be further from the truth.

I frankly doubt every one of those flights is fully loaded, and this doesn&#39;t even scratch the surface of trying to guess how many flights are required to load howitzers, armored vehicles, small arms, ATGMs, etc. Not an exaggeration to suggest that there have been literally thousands of flights to Ramstein AB or locations in Poland carrying weapons to Ukraine. Anecdotally, I&#39;ve read anecdotes from people on <a href=\"/r/AirForce\">/r/AirForce</a> complaining about the ops temp at Ramstein over the last year. Outside of this subreddit there&#39;s a popular image that giving Ukraine our gear is almost trivially easy just because we have so much sitting around. Nothing could be further from the truth. The logistic demand represents a herculean and mostly unseen effort.</p>\n</div>",

The resale of export military equipment is often a no-no. Now as long as Germany has physical custody of the equipment they *could* still do it. But the real secret sauce with these contracts is the service contract, a Gepard without a service contract will very quickly become a war memorial. And Germany isn't going to risk its preexisting relationship with Switzerland on a whole host of platforms for this one transfer to Ukraine. \n\nBut there is an interesting and underdiscussed contour to this question with the politicization of direct arms sales. Take the US and Saudi Arabia, where there are calls to cut off sales to KSA because the US politically disagrees with KSA's foreign policy (and so do I, to be clear, but see it from KSA's perspective). What happens to Ukraine if, for example, Germany says 'You can have Leos, but not to invade Russia or Crimea?' Or they get Gripens, just for Sweden to cut off parts sales the first time one of them crosses into Russia? These are hypotheticals, and at this point I think any transfer to Ukraine is going to come with some pretty explicit red lines. \n\nBut in the future it presents an interesting conundrum, if you sell to Ukraine or a country in their position what happens when they do something you dont like? If the US sells F-16s after the war, what happens if theyre one day used to strike into Russia? And if youre Ukraine, who do you buy weapons from? Europe is a convenient partner, and Sweden might cut you a deal to demonstrate Gripens. But if the US is willing to keep selling to KSA despite the domestic controversy, you might bet theyd back you in the future too. Likewise, you may hope that South Korea wont care about using K2s to retake Crimea, so long as theyre getting paid. But you balance that against the possibility that they might confiscate your new toys during a crisis with the North or with China. \n\nWeapons exports are always hard, political, and risky. Thats why ultimately most countries opt to go either with licensed production, or fully domestic. But obviously these come with their own risks and challenges, and ultimately buying into somebody's standard is attractive.",

Thermal sights are a *major* qualitative upgrade, probably the most significant in your list above, and its not clear to me Russia is able currently to produce significant numbers of their French-derivative sights.

Thermal sights are a <em>major</em> qualitative upgrade, probably the most significant in your list above, and its not clear to me Russia is able currently to produce significant numbers of their French-derivative sights.

                "body": "The question is far fetched on the short term, but not stupid. Kalilingrad has been since centuries a strategic focal point between germanic and slavic people, as well as the birthplace of Kant, etc. Nowadays it sticks out as a military sore thumb in the baltic sea, whose neighbours would be very happy to see dispensed of. If European elites and cabinets were as aggressive and strategically minded as the ones from the last century, there would be at least some conversation about hypotheticals, about letting Russia know this card is on hand. \n\nIt's obvious that there aren't Ukrainian people living there, but a successful conquest of that region would flip the moral landscape of the conflict, which today has not yet been fully equalised: everybody has normalised that Russia can attack Ukraine, and that Ukraine can defend itself, but somehow Ukraine striding into Russian territory is off the table, like if this was some sort of table top game rule. That's bullshit. Ukraine suddenly conquering Kalilingrad and turning it into a free russian speaking, EU candidate republic, safe haven for russian the political counterculture would, in the grand scheme of things, be a master move. But let's analyse your points one by one.\n\n> - This would by all reasonable sides be interpreted as Poland attacking Russia, and rightfully so.\n\nAn exaggeration. This would not be interpreted as such, but it would definitely be an escalation of tensions between Russia and Poland.

But, if long term (a year or two), we see the russian apparatus, as a state, a military logistical machine, and as a civil society, imploding (elites rebelling, countryside rebelling, army inoperational, the circumstances for a strike against Kalilingrad can open up.\n\n> - Ukraine would lose all support from the West that is contingent on not invading Russia.\n\nThis stance holds nowadays, but erodes every day.

Russia cannot and will not use their nuclear arsenal. The US has privately informed them of the catastrophic consequences of them doing so, whatever the circumstances. Probably entering directly into conflict, strategic bombing, etc. Moreover, it would take weeks for the russian military to prepare logistically for a nuclear launch, and the world would know before hand.

                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>The question is far fetched on the short term, but not stupid. Kalilingrad has been since centuries a strategic focal point between germanic and slavic people, as well as the birthplace of Kant, etc. Nowadays it sticks out as a military sore thumb in the baltic sea, whose neighbours would be very happy to see dispensed of. If European elites and cabinets were as aggressive and strategically minded as the ones from the last century, there would be at least some conversation about hypotheticals, about letting Russia know this card is on hand. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s obvious that there aren&#39;t Ukrainian people living there, but a successful conquest of that region would flip the moral landscape of the conflict, which today has not yet been fully equalised: everybody has normalised that Russia can attack Ukraine, and that Ukraine can defend itself, but somehow Ukraine striding into Russian territory is off the table, like if this was some sort of table top game rule. That&#39;s bullshit. Ukraine suddenly conquering Kalilingrad and turning it into a free russian speaking, EU candidate republic, safe haven for russian the political counterculture would, in the grand scheme of things, be a master move. But let&#39;s analyse your points one by one.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>This would by all reasonable sides be interpreted as Poland attacking Russia, and rightfully so.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>An exaggeration.
