Nor do I think they were rushed to the front line to perform that role. \n\nThe Russian mobilization actually made lots of sense because they had been suffering from a major manpower crisis for months without solutions to sustain the force in the long run. The use of volunteers was not working, and they had no way to reconstitute existing units dangerously undermanned while growing the overall force structure needed to finally conduct unit rotations to get existing units totally out of the theater so they can be rested, rebuilt, etc, let alone plug large gaps on the front line because it's already too long for them to man properly. \n\nRight now, in think the priority was to get the first round of previously trained/experienced Mobiks to the front to stabilize the situation to prevent more operational defeats. So their emphasis is defense. \n\nWhile they're doing that, the rest of the supposed 300,000 Mobiks are supposed to be training and then getting ready to deploy. Maybe those might be used for offensive ops to some degree, likely since few armies (and definitely not the Russians) would rather fight defensively than offensively. \n\nWhen the Mobiks show up I doubt they'll just augment existing units, instead they'll start relieving them. The existing veteran units need to leave Ukraine and report back to their home stations, to not only properly reconstitute but also because Russia's borders are basically unprotected by actual Russian Armed Forces ground troops, which is another reason Putin has to rattle the nuclear saber, as the strategic rocket force is the only thing protecting Russia from a foreign invasion at this point. The Mobiks give them that ability, 300,000 effectively doubles the prewar active duty Russian Ground Forces branch of service, which I don't think was a coincidence.\n\nIf Ukraine wants to test the Mobiks, and they should, their best plan would be to wait a bit until they're well supplied, the weather improves for sustained tactical mobility, and their intel finds a weak gathering of Russian Mobik units. After they smash them in a set piece battle they dump the operational scheme to open source (like they did in Kharkiv and past operations) so everyone knows who was involved and which exact Russian units got beat. That'll not only embarrass the Russians again but also lower morale among the Mobiks, who will wonder when it's their turn for the same to happen.\n\n>It's ultimately why they're continuing their pushes around Avdiivka and Bakhmut.\n\nRealistically, Russia has no real chance in the foreseeable future of seizing the rest of Donetsk, but I think the orders from Putin and the MOD never officially told the local operational commanders to stop their attacks, which could explain why they're still attacking.\n\nIn a less \"Russians are stupid, stubborn, and Putin is micromanaging the war\" argument, because we don't really know about the cost of those continued attacks by the Russians in terms of manpower and supplies, they might view them as successful fixing attacks that are bottling up and attriting sizeable numbers of UAF units that might otherwise be on the offensive, while retaining the initiative.",

That&#39;ll not only embarrass the Russians again but also lower morale among the Mobiks, who will wonder when it&#39;s their turn for the same to happen.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It&#39;s ultimately why they&#39;re continuing their pushes around Avdiivka and Bakhmut.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Realistically, Russia has no real chance in the foreseeable future of seizing the rest of Donetsk, but I think the orders from Putin and the MOD never officially told the local operational commanders to stop their attacks, which could explain why they&#39;re still attacking.</p>\n\n<p>In a less &quot;Russians are stupid, stubborn, and Putin is micromanaging the war&quot; argument, because we don&#39;t really know about the cost of those continued attacks by the Russians in terms of manpower and supplies, they might view them as successful fixing attacks that are bottling up and attriting sizeable numbers of UAF units that might otherwise be on the offensive, while retaining the initiative.</p>\n</div>",

I don&#39;t know about others, but we are holding on, regrouping, building up reserves, strengthening the defence, and gradually liberating our homeland.</p>\n\n<p>The victory is given to us very hard. But it will definitely be secured.</p>\n</div>",

This isn't NEW spending, this is actually using something rather than just watching it rust and rot. This is GOOD USE of this. \nThis money WAS ALREADY domestically spent, on weapon design and manufacturing, directly benefitting American workers.\n\n2. A lot of these weapons have never been actually tested or used against a credible opponent that they were designed for. Using them in Afghanistan or Iraq was not even close to a credible use case that was intended for these weapons and platforms. US military is literally getting a full trial of their weapons systems in a theater they were intended for, against the enemy they were intended for. This is a perfect situation for literally all the reasons - training, field testing, combat performance, and everything else, that USMIL never ever had before with these weapons systems.\n\n3. Sure, Ukraine isn't really that far off from Russia in terms of corruption, BUT - Russia is far, far, far more of a criminal oligarchy state, run by essentially the Russian mob, that has captured the government policy, domestic key industries and military. At least Ukrainian government is west leaning and actually wants reforms and some resemblance of a functioning democracy, so again, this is very well invested in. \n\n4. Zero American boots on the ground, zero deaths, in one of the most bloodiest modern conflicts in history, while the US gets to have a massive influence - this is effort and material incredibly well spent.

This is GOOD USE of this. \nThis money WAS ALREADY domestically spent, on weapon design and manufacturing, directly benefitting American workers.</p></li>\n<li><p>A lot of these weapons have never been actually tested or used against a credible opponent that they were designed for. Using them in Afghanistan or Iraq was not even close to a credible use case that was intended for these weapons and platforms. US military is literally getting a full trial of their weapons systems in a theater they were intended for, against the enemy they were intended for. This is a perfect situation for literally all the reasons - training, field testing, combat performance, and everything else, that USMIL never ever had before with these weapons systems.</p></li>\n<li><p>Sure, Ukraine isn&#39;t really that far off from Russia in terms of corruption, BUT - Russia is far, far, far more of a criminal oligarchy state, run by essentially the Russian mob, that has captured the government policy, domestic key industries and military. At least Ukrainian government is west leaning and actually wants reforms and some resemblance of a functioning democracy, so again, this is very well invested in. </p></li>\n<li><p>Zero American boots on the ground, zero deaths, in one of the most bloodiest modern conflicts in history, while the US gets to have a massive influence - this is effort and material incredibly well spent.

Helicopters are unstable without control inputs from a human or mechanical system. If it was humans, I would have expected to see an attempt to land in one of those fields with utmost urgency, but it just kept flying along and even appeared to accelerate rather than slow for a landing, since the front dips at 18s but in a controlled way, not a loss-of-control way. The MANPADS(?) impact happens at 12s, and the crash at 60s, so 48 seconds of post-strike flight. At least in the immediate aftermath of the strike, the cockpit appears to be intact and not on fire, but who knows what internal damage might have incapacitated the pilots.",

Biden had barely finished telling Zelenskyy he\u2019d just greenlighted another $1 billion in U.S. military assistance for Ukraine when Zelenskyy started listing all the additional help he needed and wasn\u2019t getting. Biden lost his temper, the people familiar with the call said. The American people were being quite generous, and his administration and the U.S. military were working hard to help Ukraine, he said, raising his voice, and Zelenskyy could show a little more gratitude.\n\n>Administration officials said Biden and Zelenskyy\u2019s relationship has only improved since the June phone call, after which Zelenskyy made a statement praising the U.S. for its generous assistance. But the clash reflects Biden\u2019s early awareness that both congressional and public support for sending billions of dollars to Ukraine could begin to fade. That moment has arrived just as the president prepares to ask Congress to greenlight even money for Ukraine.\n\n>After the pushback Zelenskyy got in their June phone call, his team decided to try to defuse tensions, concluding it wasn\u2019t productive to have friction with the U.S. president, according to two sources familiar with the Ukraine government\u2019s view, congressional aides and two European officials.\n\nThe release of stories like this is worrying. As with the recent open letter, it could convince Russian elites that Western will is fraying even at the highest levels and they only need to bide their time until Ukraine is thrown under the bus *\u00e0 la* Afghanistan.

The American people were being quite generous, and his administration and the U.S. military were working hard to help Ukraine, he said, raising his voice, and Zelenskyy could show a little more gratitude.</p>\n\n<p>Administration officials said Biden and Zelenskyy\u2019s relationship has only improved since the June phone call, after which Zelenskyy made a statement praising the U.S. for its generous assistance. But the clash reflects Biden\u2019s early awareness that both congressional and public support for sending billions of dollars to Ukraine could begin to fade. That moment has arrived just as the president prepares to ask Congress to greenlight even money for Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>After the pushback Zelenskyy got in their June phone call, his team decided to try to defuse tensions, concluding it wasn\u2019t productive to have friction with the U.S. president, according to two sources familiar with the Ukraine government\u2019s view, congressional aides and two European officials.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The release of stories like this is worrying. As with the recent open letter, it could convince Russian elites that Western will is fraying even at the highest levels and they only need to bide their time until Ukraine is thrown under the bus <em>\u00e0 la</em> Afghanistan. Why would insiders disclose this story to the press?</p>\n</div>",

In the long term they will support breakaway movements and attempt to form independent states that they will be able to pull into the Chinese sphere of influence.</p>\n</div>",

The things do appear on radar, just hard to distinguish from birds. \n\n2. Combine that with a microphone based system (these things are extremely loud and have a distinctive sound, and the technology for this system already exists) and you can have a team of 100 operators with little training quickly telling you where drones are. \n\n3. Combine that with patrols that cover areas, really you don't need many, then you have an effective area and time to counter them. It's not that complicated math to figure out how to intercept. Once 4 planes are in range of 40 of these drones, it's not going to take long to shoot them down. These things arent built to survive even a single bullet.\n\n\nThese propeller planes aren't complex machines. You really just need a flat road to be a runway, so it's relatively easy to create stations everywhere.

Once the missile is fired and traveling fast enough, a solid-fuel boost motor falls away and a cruise motor takes over; at that point, the weapon flies in a figure-eight pattern and looks for targets.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/19/us/iran-missiles-yemen.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/19/us/iran-missiles-yemen.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Footage of Iran&#39;s &#39;Missile 358&#39; taking down Chinese and American UAVs in Saudi/Yemeni skies:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/imp_navigator/status/1437809741590319109?t=g8Z2TTIkXASdjjls5GC8kQ&amp;s=19\">https://twitter.com/imp_navigator/status/1437809741590319109?t=g8Z2TTIkXASdjjls5GC8kQ&amp;s=19</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/imp_navigator/status/1481665800004149249?t=AMSO7yD9Zy8kKGauKcD4sw&amp;s=19\">https://twitter.com/imp_navigator/status/1481665800004149249?t=AMSO7yD9Zy8kKGauKcD4sw&amp;s=19</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/imp_navigator/status/1406712977781297167\">https://twitter.com/imp_navigator/status/1406712977781297167</a>\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/NC6gz0U8zkU\">https://youtu.be/NC6gz0U8zkU</a></p>\n\n<p>Technical details of the revolutionary missile explained by Pataramesh:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Pataramesh/status/1322463620358377472?t=b2bUYA2uRKfEfHea-yJzrQ&amp;s=19\">https://twitter.com/Pataramesh/status/1322463620358377472?t=b2bUYA2uRKfEfHea-yJzrQ&amp;s=19</a></p>\n</div>",

There's been an information blackout in Kherson for months now, not just the past week btw.\n\nThe offensive hasn't made much progress in the last month, but then again, it didn't make much progress for several months before the Northern part of the front collapsed in late Sept/early October. \n\nMy take is that Ukraine is doing probing attacks on Russian forces and using longrange precision fires to attrit Russian forces on a daily basis. In other words, they're slowly bleeding Russian forces on the Western side of the river and maintaining pressure on them. In time it will probably lead to another breakthrough, but who knows how long it might take. The goal of Ukrainian forces is to drive down towards the Nova Khakova dam in order to at least get it within tube artillery range, as that's Russia's primary crossing point to supply and reinforce their troops, and would also be essential for Russia to hold if they try to evacuate their forces.",
