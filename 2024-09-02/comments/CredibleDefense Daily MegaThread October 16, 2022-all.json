The Kraken Special Unit announces the release of Kislovka and Kotlyarovka. There was also a video with Ukrainian forces in Krokhmalny (south of Kotlyarovka).\n\n>Many experts believe that Russian forces will now attempt to attack Bakhmut from the north and south, cutting it off from the supply line. Both sides are trying to use this tactic to force the enemy forces to retreat from the city.\n\n\n>It was relatively quiet in the Kherson direction in the previous days. Russian attacks on Novaya Kamenka and Sukhoi Stavok were reported, both attacks were repulsed.\n\n>There were reports in the Western media (with reference to Western military officials) that the entire Kherson region up to the Dnieper may be released next week. Our team is not sure of the realism of these plans.\n\n>Over the past 24 hours, many pro-Russian telegram channels (including WarGonzo) have reported that Ukrainian attacks on the Russian defense line have begun, but their result is not yet clear. Satellite images of FIRMS fires confirm the intensification of fighting.\n\n>Also in pro-Russian telegram channels (for example, Grey Zone, Sladkov+) they write that a critical situation is developing for Russian forces in the Kherson region, the most difficult battles have begun, a Ukrainian counteroffensive with artillery training is being conducted in the direction of Novogrigorovka-Mylovoe. After pulling up the reserves, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are again trying to break through the front line. With further offensive, they may be able to reach the outskirts of Kherson.\n\n\n>Russian forces continue to shell Ukrainian cities with S-300 missiles and Shahed-136 barrage ammunition. On October 13, Kharkiv was shelled, and Zaporozhye was shelled on the morning of October 14. We do not yet have accurate information about the victims.\n\n\n>Shelling of the Belgorod region\n\n>On October 14, the Luch CHPP was shelled in Belgorod. We believe that either a high-precision Excalibur projectile or a Highmars projectile was used. We believe that it was not a barrage munition, because the video at the time of arrival can hear a sound similar to a whistle, but there is no sound of a drone motor.\n\n>Given that this is not the first such incident, we believe that it may be a demonstration of the readiness of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to shell Russia's energy infrastructure in response, which is a violation of international humanitarian law. Even if this is done in response to the actions of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. Our team admits that such shelling may have a bad impact on the prospects for the supply of ATACMS long-range missiles to Ukraine.\n\n\n>On October 13, in the Belgorod region, Ukrainian forces hit an ammunition depot, 3 Russian Guardsmen were killed and 19 wounded.\n\n\n>On the morning of October 14, a Tochka-U rocket (presumably Ukrainian) arrived in the Belgorod region, power lines near the railway were damaged.\n\n\n>On the morning of October 16, a video of the hit of an AGM-88 HARM anti-radar missile on the Russian air defense system was shot near the Belgorod airport.\n\n\n>Shooting in the Belgorod region\nAt the range where the mobilized were brought to the shooting range, two mobilized (according to some reports, three) began shooting at other servicemen with a machine gun. At the moment, it is known that 11 people have been killed on the spot, 15 have been injured and are in hospitals. Two shooters were killed in return fire. The reasons for the incident are still unknown.\n\n>The Russian Defense Ministry declared the incident a terrorist attack and stressed that the attackers came from one of the CIS countries. Perhaps in this way the agency is trying to blame the FSB for what happened.\n\n\n>Mobilization news\n\n>Putin said that partial mobilization will end within two weeks. Of the planned 300 thousand people, 222,000 have already been sent to the unit, and no new proposals have been received from the Ministry of Defense. Putin also explained that the length of the line of contact exceeds a thousand kilometers and it is impossible to protect it only by contractors, so it was necessary to declare partial mobilization. It should be noted that the \"line of contact\" is the front line, so it is likely that mortality among the mobilized will be much higher than among contractors in previous months before the announcement of mobilization, which means that new waves of appeal can be expected.\n\n\n>It is reported that in Crimea, the mobilized were given torn bulletproof vests, they tried to hide the holes with tape.\n\n\n>Alexei Martynov, a mobilized official of the Moscow City Hall, died in Ukraine. He headed one of the departments in the Moscow government, was mobilized on September 23 and died on October 10.\n\n>We plan to reduce the mobilization summary and not report all deaths of the mobilized, as there are a lot of them. We will talk only about the most important ones, as in the case of Belgorod.\n\n\n>It is reported that Colonel Girkin (Igor Strelkov) went to the front.\n\n\n>The United States announced the sending of a new package of military assistance to Ukraine. It will include:\n\n-\tadditional shells for HIMARS MLRS;\n-\t23,000 shells for 155 mm artillery;\n-\t500 high-precision 155 mm shells;\n-\t5,000 155 mm shells for remote mining by anti-tank mines;\n-\t5,000 anti-tank shells;\n-\tHARM anti-radar missiles;\n-\tmore than 200 HMMWV armored vehicles;\n-\tsmall arms and more than 2,000,000 rounds of ammunition.\n\n>In the coming years, the U.S. plans to triple production of 155 mm shells and more than double the production of GMLRS shells for the Highmars. At the moment, the U.S. has allocated a significant part of its stocks of shells to Ukraine: more than 1 million artillery shells and a large number of GMLRS shells.\n\n\u2026\n\n[Def Mon also released their update thread. ](https://nitter.it/DefMon3/status/1581702585852968960#m)\n\n>This will be as short update since I'm busy and there isn't much new information. \n\n[Map here. ](https://www.scribblemaps.com/maps/view/Operational%20Map%20Ukraine/nBT8ffpeGH)\n\n[Unrolled thread here. ](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1581702585852968960.html)",

You have to be specific about whether you mean the iron dome or a land based phalanx or something else.\n\nBut anyway. To answer you. \n\nAny guided weapon will be cost ineffective for drones. There are videos of them being shot down by firearms. The drones are neither durable nor extremely manoeuvrable, and they announce their presence very loudly and can be spotted easily. It\u2019s almost fantastic how they\u2019re basically a piece of explosive with four small rotors and the same signal capability that your average film crew has. \n\nThe problem with using radar with them is that they don\u2019t have a very large signature, nor are they actively or passively homing on the target to leave any emissions to follow. They also run cool, which means heatseeking weapons are not always effective and almost always overkill. \n\nThe perfect weapon for these is a suitable radar ( I know it can be done but I don\u2019t know the specifics) coupled with a normal flak gun firing dumb rounds, or if you\u2019re feeling rich, proximity fused rounds. \n\nYou know what would be great right now? WW2 soldiers who used a Bofors 40 or Flak gun with [these dumb (but clever) sights. ](https://i.imgur.com/gnmrJ9r.jpg)\n\nThis is the devil in the drone\u2019s detail: it\u2019s so low tech that nearly all modern systems are overkill for it.

        "body": "Found interesting bits about the AGM-88 HARM. Off the wiki. Just today I wondered, if Ukraine is using the HARM, what\u2019s the platform? \n\n>\tAs built, Soviet-era aircraft do not have the computer architecture to accept NATO standard weapons. Indeed, none of the former Warsaw Pact countries, even those that have had their Soviet-era aircraft updated, were enabled to fire a HARM before.[22] The interface seemed difficult unless using a \"crude modification\", such as integrating it with an added e-tablet into the cockpit, building a nearly totally independent subsystem within the carrying aircraft.[23] As suggested by Domenic Nicholis, defense correspondent for the Telegraph in the UK, the HARM missile is possibly operating in one of its three modes that enables it to find its target once flying after being released towards a possible enemy air defense and electronic emission area. Pre mission or during flight, NATO signals intelligence aircraft or different intelligence would be providing the overall electromagnetic emissions battlefield to locate the Russian radars where the Ukrainian jets, armed with HARMs would be directed to fire them. This allows the missile to achieve a very long range attack profile, even if it's possible that the missile does not find a target while flying, going wasted.[24] A second possible use of the HARM is operating it in a mode called \u201cHARM as sensor\u201d. Similar to the described mode before, the missile acts as both sensor and weapon, not requiring a sensor pod. A simple interface would show that the missile has a target and the pilot can launch it. In this way the range is shorter, and the jet could be under threat already, but would maximize the possibility to hit the emitter.[25]\n\n>In August 2022, a senior U.S. defense official confirmed that the Ukrainians have successfully integrated the AGM-88 HARM missile onto their \"MiG aircraft\", hinting the MiG-29 was the chosen fighter jet[26] with video evidence of AGM-88 missiles fired by upgraded Ukrainian MiG-29s released by the Ukrainian Air Force a few days later.[27]\n\n>Ukraine has released footage of a MiG-29 firing an AGM-88 HARM at a target. For a weapon that relies on digital display to fire, the question of how it has been integrated into the MiG-29's analogue displays remains unanswered. [28]\n\n>On 30 August 2022 the Ukrainian Air Force posted a first-person shooter video on its Twitter account of a Ukrainian pilot named Ivan firing AGM-88 HARM missiles.[29] The Forbes correspondent says that \"Ukrainian pilots apparently are firing the HARMs blind, using a mode that requires no new hardware in the single-seat, supersonic MiG\u2019s cramped cockpit.\"[30]\n\n>Speaking on 19 September, US Air Force General James B. Hecker said the effort to integrate AGM-88 HARM missiles into the Ukrainian Su-27s and MiG-29s took \"some months\" to achieve. This does not give the Ukrainian air force the same \"capabilities that it would on an F-16.\u201d However he said: \u201cEven though you don\u2019t get a kinetic kill \u2026 you can get local air superiority for a period of time where you can do what you need to do.\u201d[31]\n\n>During early September 2022, a Ukrainian Su-27S was spotted with an AGM-88 HARM fitted on the wing pylons. This is the first case of an Su-27 being spotted with an AGM-88 fitted. The missile has been directly fitted to the APU-470 missile launchers, the same launcher used by MiG-29 and Su-27 to fire missiles like the R-27 (air-to-air missile). This suggests that mounting the missile on Soviet aircraft is much easier than experts initially believed. Being as simple as \"requiring just an interface for the different wirings and the hanging points of the missile\". The earlier footage of a Ukrainian MiG-29 using an AGM-88 indicated that the display recognized the missile as a R-27EP, which is designed to lock onto airborne radars. This suggests that the aircraft are using their own avionics to fire the missile, without the need for additional modifications.[32]",

This does not give the Ukrainian air force the same &quot;capabilities that it would on an F-16.\u201d However he said: \u201cEven though you don\u2019t get a kinetic kill \u2026 you can get local air superiority for a period of time where you can do what you need to do.\u201d[31]</p>\n\n<p>During early September 2022, a Ukrainian Su-27S was spotted with an AGM-88 HARM fitted on the wing pylons. This is the first case of an Su-27 being spotted with an AGM-88 fitted. The missile has been directly fitted to the APU-470 missile launchers, the same launcher used by MiG-29 and Su-27 to fire missiles like the R-27 (air-to-air missile). This suggests that mounting the missile on Soviet aircraft is much easier than experts initially believed. Being as simple as &quot;requiring just an interface for the different wirings and the hanging points of the missile&quot;. The earlier footage of a Ukrainian MiG-29 using an AGM-88 indicated that the display recognized the missile as a R-27EP, which is designed to lock onto airborne radars. This suggests that the aircraft are using their own avionics to fire the missile, without the need for additional modifications.[32]</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",
