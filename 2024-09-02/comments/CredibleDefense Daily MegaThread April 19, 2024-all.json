This breakthrough test flight, during which a pilot was in the X-62A's cockpit as a failsafe, was the culmination of a series of milestones that led 2023 to be the year that \"made machine learning a reality in the air,\" according to one official. These developments are a potentially game-changing means to an end that will feed directly into future advanced uncrewed aircraft programs like the U.S. Air Force's Collaborative Combat Aircraft effort.*\n\n*Details about the autonomous air-to-air test flight were included in a new video about the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Air Combat Evolution (ACE) program and its achievements in 2023. The U.S. Air Force, through the Air Force Test Pilot School (USAF TPS) and the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), is a key participant in the ACE effort. A wide array of industry and academic partners are also involved in ACE. This includes Shield AI, which acquired Heron Systems in 2021. Heron developed the artificial intelligence (AI) 'pilot' that won DARPA's AlphaDogfight Trials the preceding year, which were conducted in an entirely digital environment, and subsequently fed directly into ACE.*\n\n*\"2023 was the year ACE made machine learning a reality in the air,\" Air Force Lt. Col. Ryan Hefron, the ACE program manager, says in the newly released [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZSuCgVpfkQ)*\n\n*DARPA, together with the Air Force and Lockheed Martin, had first begun integrating the so-called artificial intelligence or machine learning \"agents\" into the X-62A's systems back in 2022 and conducted the first autonomous test flights of the jet using those algorithms in December of that year. That milestone was publicly announced in February 2023.*\n\n*The X-62A, which is a heavily modified two-seat F-16D, is also known as the Variable-stability In-flight Simulator Test Aircraft (VISTA). Its flight systems can be configured to mimic those of virtually any other aircraft, which makes it a unique surrogate for a wide variety of testing purposes that require a real-world platform. This also makes VISTA an ideal platform for supporting work like ACE.*\n\n*\"So we have an integrated space within VISTA in the flight controls that allows for artificial intelligence agents to send commands into VISTA as if they were sending commands into the simulated model of VISTA,\" Que Harris, the lead flight controls engineer for the X-62A at Lockheed Martin, says in the new ACE video. Harris also described this as a \"sandbox for autonomy\" within the jet.*\n\n[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8q19qHsizfE) shows the X-62A flying in formation with an F-16C and an F-22 Raptor stealth fighter during a test flight in March 2023.\n\n*The X-62A subsequently completed 21 test flights out of Edwards Air Force Base in California across three separate test windows in support of ACE between December 2022 and September 2023. During those flight tests, there was nearly daily reprogramming of the \"agents,\" with over 100,000 lines of code ultimately changed in some way. AFRL has previously highlighted the ability to further support this kind of flight testing through the rapid training and retraining of algorithms in entirely digital environments.*\n\n*Then, in September 2023, \"we actually took the X-62 and flew it against a live manned F-16,\" Air Force Lt. Col. Maryann Karlen, the Deputy Commandant of the USAF TPS, says in the newly released video. \"We built up in safety [with]... the maneuvers, first defensive, then offensive then high-aspect nose-to-nose engagements where we got as close as 2,000 feet at 1,200 miles per hour.\"*\n\n*The X-62A's safely conducting dogfighting maneuvers autonomously in relation to another crewed aircraft is a major milestone not just for ACE, but for autonomous flight in general. However, DARPA and the Air Force stress that while dogfighting was the centerpiece of this testing, what ACE is aiming for really goes beyond that specific context.*\n\n*\"It's very easy to look at the X-62/ACE program and see it as 'under autonomous control, it can dogfight.' That misses the point,\" Bill \"Evil\" Gray, the USAF TPS' chief test pilot, says in the newly released video. \"Dogfighting was the problem to solve so we could start testing autonomous artificial intelligence systems in the air. ...every lesson we're learning applies to every task you can give to an autonomous system.\"*",

From what I remember they also had access to non-public Siemens specs, so what looked liked a super elaborate feat on the surface, and was certainly time and cost-intensive, in hindsight really feels more like a PoC that was somewhat overrated mainly for being a (putative) first of its kind.\n\nMy personal feeling for quite some time has been that, generally speaking, western agencies have a markedly defensive mindset and something of a surveillance fetish, particularly mass surveillance, and that may go some way in explaining why they're relatively good at antiterrorism, yet conspicuously absent on the near peer/hybrid front. Also it's not like the others sleep, or keep waiting for something to happen or the other side to catch up. As an example that I think is relevant, many states in continental Europe, but especially like China, Russia or Iran have begun to migrate more and more of their exposed computers in public, authority or industrial settings away from using Windows or Mac and towards more transparent Linux systems, often homegrown and/or certified. Clearly cost is not the only reason. Speaking of Stuxnet, it's an interesting aspect in light of a recent, astonishing and well-publicized attack (asymmetric backdoor) in the lzma compression software, that is free and heavily used in such environments. Some suspect a state actor. Highly speculative as it is, you'd have to wonder *who* is possibly losing ground or access, while having had a much easier time with getting backdoors in Windows/Macs. This one was fortuitously identified by someone at Microsoft, though I'm not (yet) going to call it ironic, again the origins remain pure speculation. However it's probably wise to remember that just having the \"Western\" accolade doesn't automatically make you top-notch in everything you attempt, or even just as good, if anything one might have the impression of a western falling behind in quite some ways, boldness being one of those. And what people call \"cyber\" is really just one trick out of a whole bag aggressors like Russia play and constantly amend, combine, interweave, we shouldn't lose ourselves in it. Lastly of course some things simply are not and never will be possible to reproduce, often for legal, ethical or political reasons.

                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>You&#39;re right in not considering it equivalent for a host of other reasons, one of them that Russia is not Iran, but Israel is also not a western country in the strict sense and that was primarily an Israeli operation, Israeli interest, relying on Israeli assets, access (to Iran), etc. If it wasn&#39;t their idea to begin with. From what I remember they also had access to non-public Siemens specs, so what looked liked a super elaborate feat on the surface, and was certainly time and cost-intensive, in hindsight really feels more like a PoC that was somewhat overrated mainly for being a (putative) first of its kind.</p>\n\n<p>My personal feeling for quite some time has been that, generally speaking, western agencies have a markedly defensive mindset and something of a surveillance fetish, particularly mass surveillance, and that may go some way in explaining why they&#39;re relatively good at antiterrorism, yet conspicuously absent on the near peer/hybrid front. Also it&#39;s not like the others sleep, or keep waiting for something to happen or the other side to catch up. As an example that I think is relevant, many states in continental Europe, but especially like China, Russia or Iran have begun to migrate more and more of their exposed computers in public, authority or industrial settings away from using Windows or Mac and towards more transparent Linux systems, often homegrown and/or certified. Clearly cost is not the only reason. Speaking of Stuxnet, it&#39;s an interesting aspect in light of a recent, astonishing and well-publicized attack (asymmetric backdoor) in the lzma compression software, that is free and heavily used in such environments. Some suspect a state actor. Highly speculative as it is, you&#39;d have to wonder <em>who</em> is possibly losing ground or access, while having had a much easier time with getting backdoors in Windows/Macs. This one was fortuitously identified by someone at Microsoft, though I&#39;m not (yet) going to call it ironic, again the origins remain pure speculation. However it&#39;s probably wise to remember that just having the &quot;Western&quot; accolade doesn&#39;t automatically make you top-notch in everything you attempt, or even just as good, if anything one might have the impression of a western falling behind in quite some ways, boldness being one of those. And what people call &quot;cyber&quot; is really just one trick out of a whole bag aggressors like Russia play and constantly amend, combine, interweave, we shouldn&#39;t lose ourselves in it. Lastly of course some things simply are not and never will be possible to reproduce, often for legal, ethical or political reasons. Or because we still (want to) believe we have more to lose than others.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d love to not see anything, anymore about some &quot;Havana syndrome&quot;, or UFOs, extra-dimensional surveillance balloons, telekinesis or similar BS.

Even accounting for the target location and assuming best case positioning for the S-200 (which is also unlikely) and crucially assuming that for some reason they didn't utilize the full range of their payload, they would still only very briefly be in that envelope. \n\nThat being said if Russia are getting bolder with their strikes and was using Kh-15's then the range differential becomes much more manageable and an S-200 could in theory reach the aircraft. Russia has also demonstrated increased pressure on Ukrainian air defenses as of late, they could have wrongly assumed that the threat was manageable or that Ukrainian AD had deteriorated to the point of enabling deeper and cheaper strikes using inventories that they have otherwise been reluctant to use. Anything is possible and we just don't have enough information on this potential shootdown to make a call.\n\nMy gut feeling on this one is that it was probably a maintenance issue that Ukraine are now exploiting as a shoot down. Where it's located and the typical weapons package of Tu-22M3 missions make it very unlikely in my mind that Ukraine managed to get one within its AD envelope. There's a reason that even with Patriot and Ukraine's own S-300 systems they've been unable to strike Tu-22M3's for the last two years. \n\nFurthermore the S-200 is a relatively heavy, cumbersome and old system, it is extremely visible when deployed, so we're not talking about a system that has the benefit of shooting/scooting from a near front line position to maximize range. There's probably a good 70KM+ of distance from the front line to account for loitering munitions and Russian fires which further chips away at the S-200's range advantage. Granted the target was apparently Dnipro, which is further into Ukraine's interior, but not an unusual or out of pattern target for Tu-22M3's who up until this point have gone unmolested. \n\nI'm open to the idea that Russia got overconfident and started using the shorter range Kh-15's (the inventory for this has largely gone unused and if Russia are hurting for inventory to exploit openings it would stand to reason that these would be the first port of call) but until I see actual evidence of this it's more likely in my mind that after 2 years of constant hard work some of these airframes (which weren't particularly well looked after before the war) are developing significant issues.",

The Taiwanese state news agency CNA quoted an unnamed source as saying that the new command, the Littoral Combatant Command (\u6ff1\u6d77\u4f5c\u6230\u6307\u63ee\u90e8), will operate under the Naval Command Headquarters.*\n\n*According to LTN\u2019s report, the commanding officer of the Littoral Combatant Command will be a two-star vice admiral of the Taiwanese navy, which is equivalent to the three-star admiral in the US Navy, JMSDF or NATO OF-8. The Littoral Combatant Command will integrate the existing fleet of fast attack boats, together with the Naval Maritime Surveillance & Reconnaissance Command (\u6d77\u8ecd\u6d77\u6d0b\u76e3\u5075\u6307\u63ee\u90e8), which operates radar facilities and mobile radar systems, the Shore Based Anti-ship Missile Group (also known as Hai Feng (Sea Blade) Group\uff0c\u6d77\u92d2\u5927\u968a) will also be integrated.*\n\n*According to CNA, Littoral Combatant Command will incorporate marine surveillance, striking, and communication capabilities, as well as coastal mobile forces. An unidentified source told CNA that the new command\u2019s duties and debut date are still being planned.*\n\n*Dr. Ying Yu Lin (\u6797\u7a4e\u4f51), a professor at Taiwan\u2019s Tamkang University\u2019s Graduate Institute of International Affairs and Strategic Studies, emphasized the importance of focusing on the Naval Fleets Command (\u8266\u968a\u6307\u63ee\u90e8) of the Taiwanese navy when discussing the proposed littoral combatant command. The way the fleet forces of Naval Fleets Command act as the spear, maneuvering outward to secure sea lines of communication (SLOC), while coordinating with the forces of Littoral Combatant Command, which act as the shield to secure territorial waters and shores, will have a significant impact on Taiwan\u2019s defense.*\n\n*Different from many other countries\u2019 militaries, Taiwan\u2019s shore-based anti-ship missile unit, Hai Feng Group, is currently a part of the ROC Navy.

Later, in 1987, it was transferred to the ROC Navy and listed under the Naval Command Headquarters. The Hai Feng Group was transferred to the Missile Command of the General Staff Headquarters, Ministry of National Defense in 2004, after being part of Naval Fleets Command in 1998.*\n\n*Hai Feng Group returned to the ROC Navy in 2006, and it now consists of a group headquarters, seven squadrons, four mobile squadrons, and a support squadron, all overseen by a naval captain. The second group was reportedly launched in July 2023 and restructured as Naval Sea Control Missile Command (\u6d77\u8ecd\u5236\u6d77\u98db\u5f48\u6307\u63ee\u90e8), led by a rear admiral, but the strategy has not been formally acknowledged.*\n\n*According to an earlier LTN report, the third group of Hai Feng Group is projected to be established by the end of 2024. Taiwan will have around 1000 anti-ship missiles, including homegrown Hsiung Feng II and III missiles, after receiving the US-made Harpoon Coastal Defense System (HCDS) in 2028.*",

But in practice, I expect the Biden Administration will feel more comfortable sending even more equipment to Ukraine now knowing that at least some of what has been sent has funding for its replacement allocated. \n\nIn other words, without the funding in place, the Biden Administration was hesitant to send more aid to Ukraine since it wasn't actually clear funds would be allocated to replace the equipment we already sent in this divided and dysfunctional Congress and Biden was worried about depleting US stockpiles considering the increasingly unstable geopolitical era were all now living in (see: the Iran-Israel tit for tat strikes for a recent example).\n\n>They'd then have to specifically request those \"replenished\" stocks with more money?\n\nThat's a separate pool of money (USAI). Those funds are essentially grants to Ukraine to buy US military equipment.

                "body": "Ukraine isn't out of ammo, it's just low on artillery ammo in particular. There are no reports they're low on much else affecting ground campaign (air defenses shouldn't count, besides MANPADS and a few other SHORAD systems, the UAF never did prefer situating much GBAD to support ground operations). They especially aren't low on drones, I've not heard much about ATGMs, mortars, etc. \n\nSo the exact same defensive problems that have limited successful assaults throughout the war are still prevalent. Successful attacks are very likely to take heavy losses, for unsuccessful attacks they're going to take even more. And because the stakes of the fighting are so high right now, the Russians seem to be done with low risk assaults because low risk is low reward too. \n\nWhile Russia is grabbing up territory faster now than in previous offensives, their greatest successes are attrition to the UAF. The UAF are limiting Russian success and achieving heavy losses to the Russians because they're defending so aggressively, which means they're suffering heavily too because so much of Russian fires can be delivered against them effectively. They're losing manpower they can't replace, as well as systems they have no replacements for either.\n\nFor example, Pro-UA posters love bringing up current Russian equipment losses and suggesting there is no way they're sustainable in the future. Okay, maybe true but definitely debatable because it's a guess, talking about the future is always uncertain. Prognostication is always just bullshitting. \n\nBut it's not a guess that the Ukrainians themselves right now can't sustain the equipment losses because they are already de-mechanizing units because they don't have enough AFV. They're already complaining that they don't have enough tanks and especially APC/IFV.

                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Ukraine isn&#39;t out of ammo, it&#39;s just low on artillery ammo in particular. There are no reports they&#39;re low on much else affecting ground campaign (air defenses shouldn&#39;t count, besides MANPADS and a few other SHORAD systems, the UAF never did prefer situating much GBAD to support ground operations). They especially aren&#39;t low on drones, I&#39;ve not heard much about ATGMs, mortars, etc. </p>\n\n<p>So the exact same defensive problems that have limited successful assaults throughout the war are still prevalent. Successful attacks are very likely to take heavy losses, for unsuccessful attacks they&#39;re going to take even more. And because the stakes of the fighting are so high right now, the Russians seem to be done with low risk assaults because low risk is low reward too. </p>\n\n<p>While Russia is grabbing up territory faster now than in previous offensives, their greatest successes are attrition to the UAF. The UAF are limiting Russian success and achieving heavy losses to the Russians because they&#39;re defending so aggressively, which means they&#39;re suffering heavily too because so much of Russian fires can be delivered against them effectively. They&#39;re losing manpower they can&#39;t replace, as well as systems they have no replacements for either.</p>\n\n<p>For example, Pro-UA posters love bringing up current Russian equipment losses and suggesting there is no way they&#39;re sustainable in the future. Okay, maybe true but definitely debatable because it&#39;s a guess, talking about the future is always uncertain. Prognostication is always just bullshitting. </p>\n\n<p>But it&#39;s not a guess that the Ukrainians themselves right now can&#39;t sustain the equipment losses because they are already de-mechanizing units because they don&#39;t have enough AFV. They&#39;re already complaining that they don&#39;t have enough tanks and especially APC/IFV. Nothing new there either, even over the summer, the UAF switched to mostly dismounted assaults during their great offensive at least largely because they&#39;re less costly than mechanized, so to save AFV because they know they can&#39;t easily get them replaced in the short term. </p>\n\n<p>What&#39;s that mean?

As you have yourself repeatedly noted, artillery is the number 1 killer on the Ukrainian battlefield and Ukraine is running desperately low/the balance of fires is very lopsided in Russia's favor.\n\nYou're equating lack of ammo to direct loss of defensive capabilities, which isn't the case. Yes really, the Russians still don't have tactical answers to the defensive problems, despite the UAF losses and weaknesses and the much riskier Russian tactical decision making, forward progress is still unreliable and very costly.\n\nDefensive operations always require less ammo than offensive, Ukraine should've be shooting anywhere close to what the Russians are unless they've got the excess to spend. One of the most critical reasons to voluntarily go on the defensive is to conserve to eventually  go on the offensive. Meaning the Ukrainians should only shoot just enough to succeed in their mission, which is to hold the Russians back. And they're still able to do that successfully, but not enough to attrit the Russians while avoiding their own irreplaceable losses in the meantime.\n\n>It's genuinely surprising they haven't been able to exploit their significant advantages in any meaningful way over the past 6 months.\n\nSix months ago was November, the Russians shouldn't have been able to exploit any major defeat on the Ukrainians at that time, who were still even then performing assaults as a continuation of their summer offensive. The manner of the fighting led us to this, where in the last week many (including all the UA leaders) are saying the UAF are about to break. Part of that is manipulation to get more aid, but it's also based on the truth. \n\n>I'm genuinely not sure why you haven't railed against Russia for this lack of progress frankly.\n\nTerritory doesn't matter in a war of attrition. \n\nRussia doesn't need to win any ground at the moment to win the war. They just need to sustain themselves while Ukraine can't. That's how a war of attrition goes. It's not about a unit at the tactical level being too weak to hold, or a smart maneuver allowing an exploitation of a gap. It's where the strategic situation of manpower, equipment and supplies becomes so poor that it creates a negative snowballing effect that can't be recovered. \n\nRussia doesn't need to achieve operational level breakthroughs now, they need to break the UAF and THEN they will get the operational level breakthroughs.\n\nThat's the exact same messaging the UA govt and mil and their supporters were pushing all summer and early fall. They didn't need to achieve a major tactical breakthrough, they just needed to grind away at the Russians, force them to commit their strategic reserve that they can't replenish, and then they'd finally achieve a rupture in the Russian lines that would enable a breakthrough. \n\nPicture health bars like an old video game, the Player health moves down a bit when they get hit, while the Boss enemy moves down same. But the Boss character health bar is much longer than Player and theirs keeps recharging too. \n\nThat's exactly how it happens in attritional war where one side can't sustain itself. The UAF were the Boss in summer-fall 2022, but not in summer fall 2023, the UAF had no ability to exhaust anything of the Russians, they were not nearly as weak as the UAF thought, in fact they were so strong they could take the abuse the UAF gave them and after the UAF exhausted themselves the Russians were able to go on the offensive nonstop, sustain unheard of level of losses, FOR SEVEN MONTHS. With no real end in sight. \n\nMeanwhile, we now know for a fact 1) the Ukrainians are suffering major manpower crisis, can't replace losses 2) foreign aid took a dump 3) they can't replace AFV and are starting to de-mechanize units 4) morale took a dump. Etc. \n\nThat's why I don't think the Russians are making a mistake. This is like September 2022, the enemy is brittle, attack attack attack. \n\nBack then, the Russians were brittle because they didn't take the war seriously then. But they've rectified that. They still fight like jackasses a lot of the time, but they aren't ineffective either. But the Ukrainians are already showing signs they're tapped out, domestically their people don't want to fight at the levels needed to even hold defensively, and internationally they don't have the support they used to. \n\nYes, this might blow up in Putin's face if he does irresponsible harm to the Russian armed forces while the UAF can recover themselves without any sort of major Russian strategic gain. But that's not what seems to be happening now, the evidence is stacked up that the Russians can take this and the Ukrainians can't. \n\nWar is a gamble. So I think the Russian offensive is worth the risk. Though they don't need to fight as stupidly aggressive as they are. But they are Russians, so...\n\n>That's certainly plausible, and the UAF is in its weakest state relative to Russia since maybe Summer 2022\n\nUkraine wasn't weak then, they were actually stronger than Russia. They just decided not to mass their strength in the Donbas despite deciding they weren't going to do a maneuver defense, so their forward defense partially failed.

They were exhausted from the invasion, their mobilization didn't have the time yet to induct, train and equip everyone, and they were basically out of artillery ammo in particular. \n\nThat's almost certainly why Putin telegraphed the Donbas offensive in late March, it was part of his \"Or else\" threat to get Zelensky to negotiate from a position of weakness. Then the West threw in with Ukraine, funding and military aid poured in, and Putin was stuck launching an offensive that would only have worked if the Ukrainians didn't get more aid.",
                        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I didn&#39;t say out of ammo, I said low on ammunition. I specifically mentioned it to forestall this type of thinking:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Not really. As you have yourself repeatedly noted, artillery is the number 1 killer on the Ukrainian battlefield and Ukraine is running desperately low/the balance of fires is very lopsided in Russia&#39;s favor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You&#39;re equating lack of ammo to direct loss of defensive capabilities, which isn&#39;t the case. Yes really, the Russians still don&#39;t have tactical answers to the defensive problems, despite the UAF losses and weaknesses and the much riskier Russian tactical decision making, forward progress is still unreliable and very costly.</p>\n\n<p>Defensive operations always require less ammo than offensive, Ukraine should&#39;ve be shooting anywhere close to what the Russians are unless they&#39;ve got the excess to spend. One of the most critical reasons to voluntarily go on the defensive is to conserve to eventually  go on the offensive. Meaning the Ukrainians should only shoot just enough to succeed in their mission, which is to hold the Russians back. And they&#39;re still able to do that successfully, but not enough to attrit the Russians while avoiding their own irreplaceable losses in the meantime.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It&#39;s genuinely surprising they haven&#39;t been able to exploit their significant advantages in any meaningful way over the past 6 months.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Six months ago was November, the Russians shouldn&#39;t have been able to exploit any major defeat on the Ukrainians at that time, who were still even then performing assaults as a continuation of their summer offensive. The manner of the fighting led us to this, where in the last week many (including all the UA leaders) are saying the UAF are about to break. Part of that is manipulation to get more aid, but it&#39;s also based on the truth. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I&#39;m genuinely not sure why you haven&#39;t railed against Russia for this lack of progress frankly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Territory doesn&#39;t matter in a war of attrition. </p>\n\n<p>Russia doesn&#39;t need to win any ground at the moment to win the war. They just need to sustain themselves while Ukraine can&#39;t. That&#39;s how a war of attrition goes. It&#39;s not about a unit at the tactical level being too weak to hold, or a smart maneuver allowing an exploitation of a gap. It&#39;s where the strategic situation of manpower, equipment and supplies becomes so poor that it creates a negative snowballing effect that can&#39;t be recovered. </p>\n\n<p>Russia doesn&#39;t need to achieve operational level breakthroughs now, they need to break the UAF and THEN they will get the operational level breakthroughs.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s the exact same messaging the UA govt and mil and their supporters were pushing all summer and early fall. They didn&#39;t need to achieve a major tactical breakthrough, they just needed to grind away at the Russians, force them to commit their strategic reserve that they can&#39;t replenish, and then they&#39;d finally achieve a rupture in the Russian lines that would enable a breakthrough. </p>\n\n<p>Picture health bars like an old video game, the Player health moves down a bit when they get hit, while the Boss enemy moves down same. But the Boss character health bar is much longer than Player and theirs keeps recharging too. </p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s exactly how it happens in attritional war where one side can&#39;t sustain itself. The UAF were the Boss in summer-fall 2022, but not in summer fall 2023, the UAF had no ability to exhaust anything of the Russians, they were not nearly as weak as the UAF thought, in fact they were so strong they could take the abuse the UAF gave them and after the UAF exhausted themselves the Russians were able to go on the offensive nonstop, sustain unheard of level of losses, FOR SEVEN MONTHS. With no real end in sight. </p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, we now know for a fact 1) the Ukrainians are suffering major manpower crisis, can&#39;t replace losses 2) foreign aid took a dump 3) they can&#39;t replace AFV and are starting to de-mechanize units 4) morale took a dump. Etc. </p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s why I don&#39;t think the Russians are making a mistake. This is like September 2022, the enemy is brittle, attack attack attack. </p>\n\n<p>Back then, the Russians were brittle because they didn&#39;t take the war seriously then. But they&#39;ve rectified that. They still fight like jackasses a lot of the time, but they aren&#39;t ineffective either. But the Ukrainians are already showing signs they&#39;re tapped out, domestically their people don&#39;t want to fight at the levels needed to even hold defensively, and internationally they don&#39;t have the support they used to. </p>\n\n<p>Yes, this might blow up in Putin&#39;s face if he does irresponsible harm to the Russian armed forces while the UAF can recover themselves without any sort of major Russian strategic gain. But that&#39;s not what seems to be happening now, the evidence is stacked up that the Russians can take this and the Ukrainians can&#39;t. </p>\n\n<p>War is a gamble. So I think the Russian offensive is worth the risk. Though they don&#39;t need to fight as stupidly aggressive as they are. But they are Russians, so...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>That&#39;s certainly plausible, and the UAF is in its weakest state relative to Russia since maybe Summer 2022</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ukraine wasn&#39;t weak then, they were actually stronger than Russia.

Now collapse is a broad term so it will be hard to hold him to that prediction and there are a range of outcomes that could come from these problems anywhere from a long decline/stagnation (probably worse than Japan due to China getting stuck in the middle income and Japan being fully a \"rich\" country when they hit these same issues in the 80s) to a full on \"collapse\".
