Russia went to war with the ideologic and unrealistic assumption that sanctions would not affect them and the west was too weak to do anything anyway. China evaluates its current situation much better and realises that an open war with the west would not be beneficial to them because the economic costs would outweigh the military and political benefits.\n\nBut you can\u2019t conclude from this that China doesn\u2019t want confrontation under any circumstance. If the situation were reversed and the benefits of confrontation would outweigh the costs, China would definitely consider doing it - that\u2019s the downside to their \u00ab\u00a0pragmatism.\u00a0\u00bb\n\nAnd China is actively working towards changing the tradeoff of confrontation with the west in favour of confrontation. Most visibly they\u2019re building up their military capabilities, reducing the military risks of confrontation with the west. But China is also stepping up efforts to insulate its economy - China\u2019s long-stated economic goal is to move away from an export to a consumption model (which tbh they\u2019ve spectacularly failed to do until now). That is of course the natural next step in their economic development, but it would also happen to make China much less dependent on the west - i.e. the Chinese economy would no longer be dependent on western markets to sell its products but could instead sell them to domestic consumers. They\u2019ve also stepped up [efforts to become more self-reliant on food](https://thediplomat.com/2022/02/chinas-focus-on-food-security/) (the Russian equivalent of which has arguably been the cornerstone of their program to insulate themselves from western sanctions - womp womp) or on key manufactured technology, raw materials etc like semiconductors, rare earths, you name it. Again all of this can be seen as just economic policy - but it has the very neat side-effect of insulating China from foreign sanctions over time. China also has a very insulated financial sector for example. \n\nOn the other side of the trade-off, the potential benefits of confrontation with the west for the CCP are huge. The authoritarian playbook in recent times has tended to be the same in most countries - first, the authoritarian government delivers strong growth and through that success establishes its power. Then, growth fades out and the now established government needs a new source of legitimacy. Most impressively in Russia but also in Turkey for example, the answer chosen by the government was nationalism and confrontation, with generally good results. China\u2019s growth is slowing and its government finds itself in the same situation as Putin did ten years ago - and the CCP is consistently showing strong early signs that it will choose the same route. Military buildup, autarky efforts, highly publicised diplomatic confrontation aimed at the domestic audience, youth indoctrination, the gang\u2019s all there. \n\nSo to conclude, China is indeed pragmatic, but they have strong pragmatic reasons to be confrontational towards us. Our answer shouldn\u2019t be diplomatic appeasement, as that will not change any part of the trade-off - rather, our answer should be concrete, pragmatic reasons not to step up confrontation. A military buildup in the region is the best tool to change the calculus in favour of peace by increasing the costs of war, but other things like economic pressure should also be in the toolbox. \n\nEdit: To clarify, that\u2019s what i meant by showing strength towards China - it\u2019s not exactly the same kind of strength as what we should be projecting towards Russia (i think we both agree on what kind the latter should be) but what both countries have in common is that negotiation diplomacy will not affect them. We have to put concrete reasons on the table why confrontation with us is a bad idea, because neither China nor Russia are interested in just peacefully integrating into the west.",

Btw America\u2019s economy had been on a very solid growth path until 2022. \n\n3) China\u2019s problems are much deeper and structural. For one, its non-capital-induced productivity growth has been essentially 0 for years now - this means that advancements in productivity (and thus growth) in China have almost exclusively happened through the introduction of new capital, in the form of things like machinery, infrastructure, etc (note that none of this machinery is new technology, otherwise it would go down as productivity growth due to technology). Due to the nature of the Chinese capital markets, companies have mostly been forced to finance this new capital through bank loans, which brings us to the second point - the Chinese economy, well, has too much debt. China\u2019s [private debt to GDP](http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/CHINA-DEBT-HOUSEHOLD/010030H712Q/index.html) is about 1.5x as high as that of America and the Euro area. This means that the debt burden of Chinese companies has been growing much faster than their earnings recently and has reached a very high point, and as growth slows (\u00ab\u00a0Hate it all you want\u00a0\u00bb, Chinese growth is [slowing](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62343087) at the moment) this debt burden will become [increasingly heavy](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/econographics/slow-growth-exacerbates-chinas-financial-stability-risks/). I don\u2019t want to lean on this example too much as I\u2019m going after structural factors here, but the [financial trouble](https://www.ft.com/content/01f8a2c7-4ed1-487b-aada-ac5e2b5a9932) that real estate developers find themselves in at the moment is a good illustration of the risks of over-leveraging. By the way, the Chinese government\u2019s policy response to the real estate crisis mainly driven by excessive debt has been to increase debt by increasing government borrowing and directing banks to lend more. This is thoroughly unsustainable in the long run. The third and last drag on growth id like to mention is demographics. China\u2019s population is ageing, and the number of retirees will grow exponentially in the next few years, meaning the government and individuals will have to spend more on pensions and elderly care. At the same time the productive population will shrink, thus reducing government revenue - so the government will have to either raise taxes or cut spending a lot. Either of these things will be a drag on growth, in addition to the fact that retirees consume much less than active parts of the population. \n\nSo yeah im pretty sure China will face sustained lower growth rates. I believe its medium-term growth rate will stay above that of eg the US in the medium term, but the key point is that the CCP will no longer be able to use growth as a source of legitimacy because it will be much less spectacular than previously.",

The US naturally likes to tout it's role in ending a crisis they created but at the time, Taiwan itself was as much of a deterrent if not a bigger one than the US' demonstration of their power in the Taiwan strait.\n\nEconomically China was a third rate power at best, one that couldn't even hope to stand up to the likes of Italy, and Taiwan actually had a military budget that significantly *exceeded* China's. Now China is the undeniable 2nd in world affairs and long term they have a shot at establishing a multipolar world. Militarily they outspend Taiwan 20 times over and their economic ties with Taiwan are much stronger than in the past.\n\nAt the time of the third strait crisis, less than 1% of Taiwanese exports were going to China, now the Chinese market is responsible for taking 30% of their total exports. Also in the case of a heavily import reliant island nation like Taiwan, 20% of all their imports come from China. China at the time was also strongly dependant on maintaining good relations with the US, but in today's world it seems inevitable that relations between the two countries will continue to worsen and we see less and less economic partnership between the two as well, this makes the Chinese significantly more prone to escalation in the case of another crisis.\n\nGiven all of this, I have a hard time imagining that the US would even be willing to risk it's carriers in the Taiwan strait today and even if they were willing to do so, Taiwan would probably be pushing hard for the normalization of the situation due to their dependence on China, even if it comes at the cost of the US having to lose face which would make the whole thing rather awkward.\n\nThe US should've stopped thinking about the Taiwanese situation in military terms a while ago, it's a war for influence on the island and China has been playing that game basically uncontested for over two decades, their biggest enemy being their own incompetence.",

There is also speculation that the explosion was set up from the inside.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s a video of Russians telling the film crew &quot;\u0422\u0443\u0434\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0442\u044c&quot; (Don&#39;t film there) when inside the building: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/666_mancer/status/1553032888580542468\">https://twitter.com/666_mancer/status/1553032888580542468</a></p>\n\n<p>Another source is saying that PoWs were moved to the barracks that exploded a few days ago, which makes this look like a planned terrorist attack.

That sounds like a common misconception that GPS devices send their coordinates to the satellite, which they don\u2019t.<br/>\nAnother claim is that fragments demonstrated are rusty, so it can\u2019t be HIMARS. Which is again a very weak argument - metal rusts when exposed to flame.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "I got an observation about the UkraineRusso conflict.\n\nWe're finally starting to see the weapons deployed that were designed to stop a Russian advance. \n\nIf you think about it, the USA/NATO have been war gaming Russia/USSR invading a eastern European country/NATO for pretty much the last 75 years. In that time, they have always known that Russia is likely to use rail for their logistics and would have a hard time supplying their advancing troops. They also knew that Russian doctrine relied heavily on ground vehicles such as tanks, apcs, artillery, and anti-air weapons. They also probably assumed that the airspace would be contested and that Russia/USSR would have better logistics in that they are closer to the battlefield. Additionally, they assumed that Russia/USSR would have a manpower advantage. \n\nHow do you counter an enemy like that?\n\nThere were a lot of options on the table that I know about. I ordered them in complexity, highest complexity first. Here they are:\n\n* SEAD capability, aka, knock out a lot of Russian air defenses in a AO.  then use air power to destroy all ground weapons/logistics. \n* Better use of air resources like the A10, Apache, F117, B2, F22, F15, F16, B1s, B52s, etc in order to counter Russian tanks and/or logistical support. \n* Drone warfare like the predator in order to destroy ground vehicles, high valued targets (ammunition dumps, command centers), and to gain intel (camera and EW). \n* Standoff weapons like cruise missiles or gliding bombs in order to destroy Russian logistical infrastructure\n* Better tanks that would win against Russian counterparts in a head-head battle\n* The use of precision guided ground weapon munitions such as SMART artillery rounds, excalibur, or guided HIMARs munitions in order to give NATO forces an artillery advantage. \n* Strong coordination among ground troops in order to perform combined arms fights\n* Electronic Warfare in order to deny the enemy (Russia) communications and intelligence about the battlefield.\n* Use of MANPADs to deny Russia free use of airspace\n* Use of anti-tank weapons to make up for the fewer tanks\n* Use of behind the lines forces to disrupt Russia's ability to govern, foment dissent, increase the troop requirement for pacification, gather intelligence, and to disrupt logistical support\n* Defensive tactics to give up territory for destruction of Russian fighting forces\n\nIf you look at this list, it seems like we're slowly going up it. We started at the bottom with defensive tactics, then moved to man portable weapons with better intell. We already supplied precision guided ground weapon munitions (HIMARS) and such. As far as I can tell, the USA/NATO will continue to ratchet up the preasure and go higher in this list. The last thing being high quality SEAD capability. SEAD is pretty much the trump card, because if the USA can destroy the majority of Russia's air defense systems, they can destroy all ground forces in an AO and take it very easily. And, AFAIK, it can be performed with F15/16s (with the proper training and equipment and weapons) along with a couple AWACs, EW aircraft, and drone support aircraft. It's very complicated and requires a huge amount of investment to get right.\n\nSomething that I think has NOT been talked about with F15/16 is the standoff weapons. One that peaks my interest is the GBU-39. It seems like it hasn't been used quite heavily (it was initially developed in 2006 - and it didn't seem to see a lot of use in Iraq/Afghanistan), but it offers A HUGE amount of capability. The big capability is that you can have a F15/16 circling 50-100 miles behind enemy lines, well away from enemy anti-air defenses. Then the ground forces advance on an enemy position, when they observer enemy contact, call in air support on the static location, they can drop the bombs and they'll glide in and hit the enemy in about 10-15 minutes. One F15E can carry 16 of these 250lb bombs. Basically enough to destroy just about everything in a 1km grid square. Using this technique, the Ukrainians can advance very easily without taking a lot of casualties (Aside from the initial ambush and following firefight). \n\nWhen looking at the above, now I know why Ukraine is looking to get F15/16s. Dropping those bombs would be devastating to Russian ground forces. After the first couple of incidents, the Russians would completely avoid contact with Ukrainians. \n\nI don't see how Russia wins this war. In a long enough timeline, Ukraine will kick them out of their country with the support of NATO.",

It sounds like they made a conscious decision to push these platforms to their limit.\n\nWhich is a sign of indiscipline, a training issue.  They either didn't know a limit existed in the first place (it does) because they weren't taught it or it wasn't reinforced enough to have been drilled into their heads to remember it under stress, or they knew and ignored it anyway and got away with it because the individuals in positions of authority (section chief/track commander) weren't properly trained to act like leaders to know to stop them from using their equipment improperly, because they would break it.\n\nIf firing an artillery piece in an undisciplined manner causes the piece to break, DON'T DO IT.

In order to replace a broken artillery piece caused by negligence, the busy head of state now has to plead with Germany or another country who has PzH 2000 for more in order to regain capabilities lost because crews couldn't control their rates of fire or do proper maintenance....\n\nThat's very complicated. Here is how we can simplify this: how about junior leadership tells the gun crew to slow their fucking rate of fire and to do proper PMCS, or they will be punished. Then supervise them to make sure they are slowing their rates of fire and doing proper PMCS  And then the president of Ukraine doesn't have to be bothered to unfuck something a sergeant, lieutenant or captain is supposed to be doing?\n\nEvery weapon system has rates of fire peculiar to it, even with rates and time durations to use for emergencies. Same goes for daily maintenance requirements. Violating them comes with a cost. Training was supposed to teach them those rates and routines, the TMs they were provided that were translated into Ukrainian also contain that info, they have no excuse, other than shitty training and shitty leadership. Which is their problem, which is why this issue with equipment not working is not in the slightest bit a surprise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>What kind of poorly trained crew can keep up that rate of fire for days on end?\n\nWhat kind? Poorly trained ones who don't know when to stop. Just because someone knows how to do a very basic task doesn't mean they're well trained.\n\nA toddler learns knows how to put food in their mouths and chew and that's great! But if they haven't also learned when to when to stop so they can avoid choking, getting a belly ache or vomiting, they still have much more to learn.\n\nA toddler learns how to walk and that's great! But if they haven't also learned how to avoid obstacles, walk into a wall, or avoid walking into the street to get plastered by a car, they still have much more to learn.\n\nA soldier is trained how to fire and reload a machine gun and that great!. But if they haven't also been trained not to fire at the cyclic rate for extended periods, to do maintenance, to lubricate their MG properly, they still have much more training to be considered competent.\n\nI can spent a few weeks more writing out more examples, as I have over a decade of experience as both an infantry NCO running training (and fighting in combat), as well being the father of toddlers to know why training/learning is important, but these should be sufficient for anyone to understand.",

            "body": "Demography is not Destiny.\n\nOne needs to actually comprehend this statement and not just read it and assume they've got it. \nDemography as a social science discipline is bottom the barrel in hierarchy. It's lower than Economics.  \nUN World Population projection agency recently revised their Nigeria numbers downwards by a massive 200 Million people in just 2 years. That is not a rounding error amounting to meh. That is insane scale of humanity.\n\nDemographers are flying blind with their nonsensical models which do not plug in the variable of State capacity and Political Will into the equation because they can not do that since they have no way to calculating it, Yet it exists as a very real parameter in real world.\n\nFor China the Demography situation is the latest Collapsist/Doomsday fad, along the long line of China will collapse, there is going to be Hard Landing, Chinese people can't do innovation and so on. \n\nIn reality, it's a manageable challenge which will be dealt with as a low to medium tier difficulty. Things like System Stability, Taiwan, Economic system and Reform trajectory/pivoting, etc are higher tier challenges and far more serious.\n\n*First* and most fundamental to this debate is the Normalization principle. Meaning \"A Thing\" can not be specially damaging when that thing is spread across the peer groups. Meaning this Demography thing would only have been a China issue if it was the only one facing this. It isn't. Further meaning that it doesn't even need to resolve it with a high functioning solution, it just needs to reach near-parity with it's peer and that it can do just fine. It doesn't matter if China will have Japan or S Korean levels of TFR because rest of the world is going to be near similar zone anyway and no Immigration can not overcome this for multiple reason (chief among them being socio-political pressure in these societies. This isn't the 19th century and the West doesn't have unlimited access to planet's resources).\n \nNever before in the history of homo sapiens have our species encountered such a prolonged across the board [Fertility Collapse](https://ourworldindata.org/fertility-rate#the-global-decline-of-the-fertility-rate-since-1950) of this scale. This is not a China thing, this is a [world level thing](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2019-global-fertility-crash/). The worst in this will be those who have diminished capacity to react to the need to adapt or those lacking in resources. China is neither of those. \n\n*Second*, All the talk of 1-2-4 generation dynamic concern-dooming also miss out on the fact that in reality only around 35% of Chinese population was affected by 1 Child Policy (many people just had more than 1 kid anyway. 1 CP also prevented/diminished the Lag-effect seen when a country's TFR is in the middle of decline but growth is only just starting to pick up and hence State resources receive a jolt of excess population to take care of on the tail end).  \nAlso to note it wasn't the 1 Child Policy which fundamentally reduced Chinese population, it was normal Family Planning, which predated the 1 Child Policy by more than a decade. That is what did the super majority of population growth reduction in China, NOT 1 Child Policy.  \n  \nAnd more importantly, there will also be a Inheritance boom since more grandparents means more funneling of wealth. And this effect will be more pronounced in families which have less siblings (the scary picture narrative scenarios some like to trot). China like many other Asian societies has a cultural proclivity of higher savings and this will remain even if & when China became high income society. \n\n*Third* is shift in education level of generational cohorts. The generational cohort that build modern China miracle was the same peer age as Red Guards were. College educated were miniscule proportion from this. The jump in human capital which will and is happening currently is not linear, it's abrupt and out of scale.  \n\nAs part of this another facet which one learns from Japanese experience is (since they are the poster child of ageing state), Productivity GDP per Hour Worked in Japan was similar range to US over the decades, this despite Japan ageing population.  \nMeaning just because population ages, doesn't mean they become lamer or less productive. \n\nPlus China will gradually raise the retirement ages as well. Currently Women in some Public sector domains can retire at like 50-55 years. That's absurd. Even more so when China's life-expectancy metrics are about to hit 80, esp for Women. \n\n15-65 age group is used as a Labor force pool proxy. But this is highly misleading since a person who is 69 years old in today's China or of China of 2040s isn't similar to a 69 year old Chinese from 1970s or something. This fact matters, A Lot and Demography models seem to normalize it harshly and in the narrative argument space this is taken as meh.  \n\nHaving old people is not a net negative. A state barely even has incentives to invest in resources (across domains) to accommodate an older population, Unless that state has enough old people. China has built world class infrastructure to accommodate it's current Demographics, one should not bet on them not investing in creating a society where Old people can have a comfortable living.  \nEsp given it's one of the Asian societies where old-age-bias is real, to the degree it's part of Law framework (even India has this).\n\nThe world has never experienced 400 Million humans in a Polity/Unified Labor force educated to the degree of Chinese which are coming. The Scale effects of this are not Linear, it has no prior precedence.  \nMeanwhile we do have prior precedence of what 400-800 Million if not more in the labor force as poorly educated, barely working (China had this phase for a while and India for even longer). The point being, it was manageable even if not ideal and certainly damaging. If anything the massive Young Millions but not working scale was more dangerous since that is when Wars happen. Old folk are unlikely to go to fight themselves in wars, in comparative terms.\n\n[Credit Suisse Global Wealth Reports](https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us/en/reports-research/global-wealth-report.html) since 2020 have shown that China has overtaken US in the number of people who form the Global Top 10% Wealthy (over 100 Million Chinese vs sub 100 Million Americans).  \n\n[Another aspect on this](https://archive.ph/3pQYE) is Working Age Population is not 1:1 equivalent with Actual Labor Force and for some countries this is a challenge. Like India, which despite having greater gross number of Working Age humans is unlikely to match China's actual Labor Force gross numbers due to lower Literacy rates and other socio-cultural factors (like mobility of women and caste-based drag effects). \n\n*Fourth*, China is not France, UK, or US, etc. It has a socio-cultural legacy of State action of a degree which is not seen in most other places in the world. So yes, IF the Chinese State feels the desperate need to enter the bedrooms of the Chinese people (as the saying goes), it will, because they have prior legacy of having done so.  \nNO Demography model accounts for stuff like this.  \n\nAnd yet, leading to *Fifth* point, China is only just now announcing the non-coercive policies on this front (Common Prosperity has overlap with it).  \nHukou reform is already happening (points based system, different education/skill/work level requirements are being tried by different Cities, thereby creating a market competition for human capital among Cities) and more is coming on that front.   \n\nChinese State is onto this challenge & they are not desperate, they are working on a timetable which they are comfortable with and if there is 1 thing that the last 4 decades should have informed everyone about China, it's that their Capacity to get things done is not trivial or meh level. It's the second most critical factor why China miracle happened (first being Party itself, without which thye would be at best a more successful India economically and even that is a stretch).\n\nDemographers once assumed, TFR reversal is not feasible or unknown how to and then Nordic States proved it wrong in 80s and 90s and so on. Without even special State action, the degree by which it happened organically was higher than degree of deliberate action. Meaning it's possible. \n\nIn just 10 years, which is not that long, [Half the Indian States will have seen their Demographic Dividend stage end](https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/zgCdZ3GrDwtDpQWD95HenO/Opinion--Indias-demographic-dividend-will-play-out-over-a.html). \n\nOnce again, showing categorically, Demography is a junk state level social science. It worse than Economics since at least in Economics one can polish a turd (ideological political position).  \n\nIdeologies get created on Economic Theories because it claims Destiny level profound consequences. \n\nAnyone who imparts Destiny level consequences to Demography can be safely ignored as a lunatic.\n\nStatistics is among THE most powerful sciences humanity has ever invented. The only caveat of it being, your data entry needs to be immaculate and when one doesn't even account for entire Variables no amount of Model sophistry can save that calculation. It will show nonsensical results.",
            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Demography is not Destiny.</p>\n\n<p>One needs to actually comprehend this statement and not just read it and assume they&#39;ve got it. \nDemography as a social science discipline is bottom the barrel in hierarchy. It&#39;s lower than Economics.<br/>\nUN World Population projection agency recently revised their Nigeria numbers downwards by a massive 200 Million people in just 2 years. That is not a rounding error amounting to meh. That is insane scale of humanity.</p>\n\n<p>Demographers are flying blind with their nonsensical models which do not plug in the variable of State capacity and Political Will into the equation because they can not do that since they have no way to calculating it, Yet it exists as a very real parameter in real world.</p>\n\n<p>For China the Demography situation is the latest Collapsist/Doomsday fad, along the long line of China will collapse, there is going to be Hard Landing, Chinese people can&#39;t do innovation and so on. </p>\n\n<p>In reality, it&#39;s a manageable challenge which will be dealt with as a low to medium tier difficulty. Things like System Stability, Taiwan, Economic system and Reform trajectory/pivoting, etc are higher tier challenges and far more serious.</p>\n\n<p><em>First</em> and most fundamental to this debate is the Normalization principle. Meaning &quot;A Thing&quot; can not be specially damaging when that thing is spread across the peer groups. Meaning this Demography thing would only have been a China issue if it was the only one facing this. It isn&#39;t. Further meaning that it doesn&#39;t even need to resolve it with a high functioning solution, it just needs to reach near-parity with it&#39;s peer and that it can do just fine. It doesn&#39;t matter if China will have Japan or S Korean levels of TFR because rest of the world is going to be near similar zone anyway and no Immigration can not overcome this for multiple reason (chief among them being socio-political pressure in these societies. This isn&#39;t the 19th century and the West doesn&#39;t have unlimited access to planet&#39;s resources).</p>\n\n<p>Never before in the history of homo sapiens have our species encountered such a prolonged across the board <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/fertility-rate#the-global-decline-of-the-fertility-rate-since-1950\">Fertility Collapse</a> of this scale. This is not a China thing, this is a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2019-global-fertility-crash/\">world level thing</a>. The worst in this will be those who have diminished capacity to react to the need to adapt or those lacking in resources. China is neither of those. </p>\n\n<p><em>Second</em>, All the talk of 1-2-4 generation dynamic concern-dooming also miss out on the fact that in reality only around 35% of Chinese population was affected by 1 Child Policy (many people just had more than 1 kid anyway. 1 CP also prevented/diminished the Lag-effect seen when a country&#39;s TFR is in the middle of decline but growth is only just starting to pick up and hence State resources receive a jolt of excess population to take care of on the tail end).<br/>\nAlso to note it wasn&#39;t the 1 Child Policy which fundamentally reduced Chinese population, it was normal Family Planning, which predated the 1 Child Policy by more than a decade. That is what did the super majority of population growth reduction in China, NOT 1 Child Policy.  </p>\n\n<p>And more importantly, there will also be a Inheritance boom since more grandparents means more funneling of wealth. And this effect will be more pronounced in families which have less siblings (the scary picture narrative scenarios some like to trot). China like many other Asian societies has a cultural proclivity of higher savings and this will remain even if &amp; when China became high income society. </p>\n\n<p><em>Third</em> is shift in education level of generational cohorts. The generational cohort that build modern China miracle was the same peer age as Red Guards were. College educated were miniscule proportion from this. The jump in human capital which will and is happening currently is not linear, it&#39;s abrupt and out of scale.  </p>\n\n<p>As part of this another facet which one learns from Japanese experience is (since they are the poster child of ageing state), Productivity GDP per Hour Worked in Japan was similar range to US over the decades, this despite Japan ageing population.<br/>\nMeaning just because population ages, doesn&#39;t mean they become lamer or less productive. </p>\n\n<p>Plus China will gradually raise the retirement ages as well. Currently Women in some Public sector domains can retire at like 50-55 years. That&#39;s absurd. Even more so when China&#39;s life-expectancy metrics are about to hit 80, esp for Women. </p>\n\n<p>15-65 age group is used as a Labor force pool proxy. But this is highly misleading since a person who is 69 years old in today&#39;s China or of China of 2040s isn&#39;t similar to a 69 year old Chinese from 1970s or something. This fact matters, A Lot and Demography models seem to normalize it harshly and in the narrative argument space this is taken as meh.  </p>\n\n<p>Having old people is not a net negative. A state barely even has incentives to invest in resources (across domains) to accommodate an older population, Unless that state has enough old people. China has built world class infrastructure to accommodate it&#39;s current Demographics, one should not bet on them not investing in creating a society where Old people can have a comfortable living.<br/>\nEsp given it&#39;s one of the Asian societies where old-age-bias is real, to the degree it&#39;s part of Law framework (even India has this).</p>\n\n<p>The world has never experienced 400 Million humans in a Polity/Unified Labor force educated to the degree of Chinese which are coming. The Scale effects of this are not Linear, it has no prior precedence.<br/>\nMeanwhile we do have prior precedence of what 400-800 Million if not more in the labor force as poorly educated, barely working (China had this phase for a while and India for even longer). The point being, it was manageable even if not ideal and certainly damaging. If anything the massive Young Millions but not working scale was more dangerous since that is when Wars happen. Old folk are unlikely to go to fight themselves in wars, in comparative terms.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us/en/reports-research/global-wealth-report.html\">Credit Suisse Global Wealth Reports</a> since 2020 have shown that China has overtaken US in the number of people who form the Global Top 10% Wealthy (over 100 Million Chinese vs sub 100 Million Americans).  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://archive.ph/3pQYE\">Another aspect on this</a> is Working Age Population is not 1:1 equivalent with Actual Labor Force and for some countries this is a challenge.

So you are right to say they are fallible as humans are. However, computers are exceptional at interpreting data, if they are trained and instructed correctly. Neural networks and other related techniques csn acheive some truly impressive results. Image processing, one of the fundamentally hard problems in the field, is being used at scale in industrial settings to do things such as inspect the quality of weld seams or track packages and people. \n\n\nSo, you're right that computers are only as smart as the people that program them, but the people who do that can often be exceptionally smart, especially so for the people who develop advanced applications that rely on machine learning.

So you are right to say they are fallible as humans are. However, computers are exceptional at interpreting data, if they are trained and instructed correctly. Neural networks and other related techniques csn acheive some truly impressive results. Image processing, one of the fundamentally hard problems in the field, is being used at scale in industrial settings to do things such as inspect the quality of weld seams or track packages and people. </p>\n\n<p>So, you&#39;re right that computers are only as smart as the people that program them, but the people who do that can often be exceptionally smart, especially so for the people who develop advanced applications that rely on machine learning.
