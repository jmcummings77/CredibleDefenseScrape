Any economic pain felt in the short term would just bolster the incentives to get off Russian gas in the long-term.</p>\n</div>",

They buy vitamin drinks, protein cereal bars, cigarettes. Many leave quickly.

It is a rear base for troops who have managed to break Russian defense lines and reconquer several villages - the places and interlocutors are covered by anonymity, the Ukrainian General Staff having officially prohibited journalists from circulating near the battlefield and soldiers from communicating with them.\n\nAfter a week of offensive, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Monday, September 5, that \"the Ukrainian flag is returning to where it should be\", specifying, after a meeting with the staff, that \"the information [is] good\". Moscow announces that the counter-offensive has already failed.\n\nV., an officer of a combat unit who agrees to regularly brief Le Monde on the evolution of the battle, believes that \"the Russians have put a lot of resources, village by village, in the fortification of their defenses\", in a region where they planned to soon organize \"self-determination referendums\" in order to legalize the military occupation. At the same time, or almost, a Kherson official, Kirill Stremoussov, told Russian television that, \"due to the events of the moment\", the organization of such an election would mark \"a pause\". \"In almost every village,\" continues V., \"we face tanks, artillery, minefields.

They are afraid of contact with the infantry, they are afraid to fight with the Kalashnikov, \"he continues.\n\nThe officer believes that the toll is not so bad for the Ukrainian forces. \"Given the Russian firepower, we have a lot of injuries, and the injuries are not beautiful to see. On the other hand, contrary to what Moscow claims, we have few deaths and we have lost few tanks, and weapons recently delivered by the West. We are moving forward cautiously. \u201d\n\nV. smiles. \"I'm not going to pretend, as Moscow has been doing for six months, that \"everything goes according to plan\", because I don't want to be ridiculous, but, frankly, these first days can give us hope that we will achieve serious goals within a few weeks. He immediately specifies \"not to talk about the city of Kherson itself\", his function does not allow him to know the long-term plans of the Ukrainian command.\n\nAnother officer, R., whose combat unit marks a break in the surrounding villages, so fast it has advanced during the first week, is waiting for \"reinforcements\" before considering new conquests. Meanwhile, the infantry and deminers clean the villages. \"When we go back to a village, it sometimes takes two or three days before we can settle there, so much is it mined,\" says J., a special forces soldier.\n\nIf the ambulance ballet is frequent on the roads to Mykola\u00efv and Odessa, there is no indication that Moscow's claims about a Ukrainian defeat are supported by facts. Neither the morgues nor even the hospitals seem overwhelmed, the funeral does not seem to be massive in these garrison cities, and all the soldiers met agree that they appreciate that their officers put the lives of their men before any other consideration. \"Many injured, few dead. Especially in the face of an army such as the Russian army! \"Also indicates K., machine gunner of a combat unit.\n\n\nOn the sixth day of the battle, the rain fell continuously on the front lines, sometimes with heavy showers. The pace is changing. Drones, nerves of war, stop flying and, for the first time, men relax. On the morning of the seventh day, the sun returned, the drones took off again. The enemy tanks and artillery spotted, the clashes start again. It is, V. thinks, \"a long-term battle\".",

Nuclear is going to get a good look for the first time in a long time outside of Germany as well.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Those alternatives are probably less cost effective, which is the main point I&#39;m making. I&#39;m not talking about a collapse, im merely talking about how some countries will have cheaper access to energy, while other countries will have more expensive options.</p>\n</div>",

I want to defuse the atmosphere and put an end to all the talk.  \n> \n> That day I came across a publication which said that I had been in my position for 15 years and that I was a \"long-time resident\" among regional heads. I thought that was a lot, so I decided to ask your opinion. Later I found out that I am not so \"long-lived\" - the previous record, as it turns out, is 27 years. So I'll say more: now I've decided to break the current record. Let's see if I can beat that record.\n> \n> In fact, of course, I do not have the right to just leave. People have entrusted me with the leadership of the region. And to justify that trust is my sacred duty. I can only leave if I ask the people and the President of Russia. So I'll leave talk of an indefinite leave for the future. Right now I will not even take my annual leave. \n> \n> I have said before that at this important time, when our country is fighting global satanism in Donbass, neither the regional authorities nor servicemen of all ranks should take a leave. \n> \n> As a matter of fact, there is already great news coming from the Donetsk direction.

Reasoning, analysis, predictions, speculation. I want to defuse the atmosphere and put an end to all the talk.  </p>\n\n<p>That day I came across a publication which said that I had been in my position for 15 years and that I was a &quot;long-time resident&quot; among regional heads. I thought that was a lot, so I decided to ask your opinion. Later I found out that I am not so &quot;long-lived&quot; - the previous record, as it turns out, is 27 years. So I&#39;ll say more: now I&#39;ve decided to break the current record. Let&#39;s see if I can beat that record.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, of course, I do not have the right to just leave. People have entrusted me with the leadership of the region. And to justify that trust is my sacred duty. I can only leave if I ask the people and the President of Russia. So I&#39;ll leave talk of an indefinite leave for the future. Right now I will not even take my annual leave. </p>\n\n<p>I have said before that at this important time, when our country is fighting global satanism in Donbass, neither the regional authorities nor servicemen of all ranks should take a leave. </p>\n\n<p>As a matter of fact, there is already great news coming from the Donetsk direction. Allied troops in the course of the offensive are crushing the enemy and occupying new territories. I promised you good news, you will get it soon. It won&#39;t be long now. </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, several thousand more determined volunteers and elite fighters are currently being prepared to join the advancing Allied Forces. In addition, new units, consisting of true professionals of military affairs, have been created. These are two regiments and three battalions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

        "body": "Settlement is near. Glory to Russian economy. Thank you putin!\n\nBloomberg published a report on Russia economic situations, prepared for the Kremlin. Forecasts confirmed by Economy Minister Maxim Reshetnikov.\n\nKey quotes for you consideration:\n\n\\- Two of the three scenarios in the report show the contraction accelerating next year, with the economy returning to the prewar level only at the end of the decade or later. The \u201cinertial\u201d one sees the economy bottoming out next year 8.3% below the 2021 level, while the\u201cstress\u201d scenario puts the low in 2024 at 11.9% under last year\u2019s level.\n\n\\- Beyond the restrictions themselves, which cover about a quarter of imports and exports, the report details how Russia now faces a\u201cblockade\u201d that \u201chas affected practically all forms of transport,\u201dfurther cutting off the country\u2019s economy. Technological and financial curbs add to the pressure. The report estimates as many as 200,000 IT specialists may leave the country by 2025, the first official forecast of the widening brain drain.\n\n\\- Over the next year or two, the report warns of \u201creduced production volumes in a range of export-oriented sectors,\u201d from oil and gas to metals, chemicals and wood products. While some rebound is possible later, \u201cthese sectors will cease to be the drivers of the economy.\u201d\n\n**- A full cutoff of gas to Europe, Russia\u2019s main export market, could cost as much as 400 billion rubles ($6.6 billion) a year in lost tax revenues, according to the report. It won\u2019t be possible to fully compensate the lost sales with new export markets even in the medium term.**\n\n\\- \u201cWith diminished access to Western technologies, a wave of foreign corporate divestment and demographic headwinds ahead, the country\u2019s potential growth is set to shrink to 0.5%-1.0% in the next decade.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Settlement is near. Glory to Russian economy. Thank you putin!</p>\n\n<p>Bloomberg published a report on Russia economic situations, prepared for the Kremlin. Forecasts confirmed by Economy Minister Maxim Reshetnikov.</p>\n\n<p>Key quotes for you consideration:</p>\n\n<p>- Two of the three scenarios in the report show the contraction accelerating next year, with the economy returning to the prewar level only at the end of the decade or later. The \u201cinertial\u201d one sees the economy bottoming out next year 8.3% below the 2021 level, while the\u201cstress\u201d scenario puts the low in 2024 at 11.9% under last year\u2019s level.</p>\n\n<p>- Beyond the restrictions themselves, which cover about a quarter of imports and exports, the report details how Russia now faces a\u201cblockade\u201d that \u201chas affected practically all forms of transport,\u201dfurther cutting off the country\u2019s economy. Technological and financial curbs add to the pressure. The report estimates as many as 200,000 IT specialists may leave the country by 2025, the first official forecast of the widening brain drain.</p>\n\n<p>- Over the next year or two, the report warns of \u201creduced production volumes in a range of export-oriented sectors,\u201d from oil and gas to metals, chemicals and wood products. While some rebound is possible later, \u201cthese sectors will cease to be the drivers of the economy.\u201d</p>\n\n<p><strong>- A full cutoff of gas to Europe, Russia\u2019s main export market, could cost as much as 400 billion rubles ($6.6 billion) a year in lost tax revenues, according to the report. It won\u2019t be possible to fully compensate the lost sales with new export markets even in the medium term.</strong></p>\n\n<p>- \u201cWith diminished access to Western technologies, a wave of foreign corporate divestment and demographic headwinds ahead, the country\u2019s potential growth is set to shrink to 0.5%-1.0% in the next decade. Thereafter, it will shrink further still, down to just above zero by 2050. Russia will also be increasingly vulnerable to a decline in global commodity prices, as international reserves no longer provide a buffer.\u201d  Alexander Isakov, Russia economist</p>\n\n<p><strong>- Europe\u2019s plans to stop importing Russian oil products -- about 55% of exports went there last year -- could trigger sharp cuts in production leaving the domestic market short of fuel, as well.  - Europe\u2019s sharp turn away from Russian oil and gas may also hit the Kremlin\u2019s ability to supply its own market,</strong></p>\n\n<p>- Metals producers are losing $5.7 billion a year from the restrictions, the report said.</p>\n\n<p><strong>- If the world economy slips into recession, the report warns, Russia could see exports cut further as it becomes the \u201cswing supplier\u201d on global markets, with demand for its products disappearing first.

Sanction may force Russia to seek more indigenous production and escalate costs. </p>\n\n<p>The USAAF and the RAF managed to dump millions to tons of ordnance on Germany ball bearing manufacturers in WW2 and didn&#39;t stop production. Production actually increased until almost the end of the war.</p>\n</div>",

The policy could cost as much as \u00a3130 billion over the next 18 months, according to policy documents seen by Bloomberg. \n\n>Energy bills in the UK were due to jump 80% from October to \u00a33,548 a year for the average household, forcing many poorer families to choose between heating their homes and other basics. Under the plans drawn up by Truss\u2019s team, that pricing regime will effectively be abolished and the energy regulator Ofgem will be sidelined. Instead, ministers will set a new unit price that households will pay for electricity and gas, the people said.\n\n>Truss is due to travel to Balmoral Castle in Scotland on Tuesday to meet Queen Elizabeth II before officially taking office as the successor to Boris Johnson as British prime minister. She\u2019s under pressure to come up with a solution to surging energy prices that are crushing families and businesses in the UK as Russia shuts off gas supplies to Europe in response to the sanctions imposed following its invasion of Ukraine. \n\n>Under Truss\u2019s plan, energy suppliers will be obliged to charge households a reduced rate for their energy and the government will guarantee financing that will cover the difference with what they would have charged under the previous system, according to documents seen by Bloomberg.\n\n>Jacob Rees-Mogg, who is set to become Business Secretary in Truss\u2019s government, held talks with the chief executives of energy companies Monday to discuss the plans. The companies were receptive to the idea, which means they will avoid a windfall tax and see the shortfall in their revenue covered by the taxpayer, a person present said.\n\n>During the campaign to lead the governing Conservative Party Truss had already pledged to remove a green levy of about \u00a3150 a year from bills while the previous administration had promised another \u00a3400 in government subsidies to help families. Added together with the new aid package, the average household will effectively see their bills frozen, the officials said.\n\n>The price that energy companies are allowed to charge consumers will be set by ministers will likely be reviewed every quarter, the person added.\n\n>As recently as last week, Truss had wanted to extend the existing support package put in place by former chancellor Rishi Sunak from \u00a3400 per household to \u00a31,000.

If you mean by forecasting the exact temps over a week you\u2019re right that they can\u2019t go tell you the exact average on a given week in the middle of December.
