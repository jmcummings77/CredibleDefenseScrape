Besides that, the withdrawal seemed very calm and pre-planned compared to every other withdrawal in this war so far. Almost like it was already set in motion when SD fell, if not before. In fact, evacuation of the willing was also done a long time ago it seems and most non-artillery fighting in Lysychansk was limited to a factory seemingly to delay the Russian's a little bit. Probably to further evacuate either equipment or last few civilians.

Wouldn't be the dumbest idea with their new weapon systems, since they could and have been striking an insane amount of ammunition depots in the Russian rear. Maybe their intention is to have Russia commit its fresh 3rd Batallions and then starve them off ammunition once they're already committed deep in the country. A reverse scorched earth. Instead of burning the earth as you retreat, you burn it through long range precision fires once your enemy has pushed into logistically challenging locations. I will admit that the quick withdrawal from Lysychansk and the ammunition depot strikes could be completely isolated from each other. Causation doesn't equal correlation as they say... But what if? It could totally be a determining factor if that is an intentional honeypot strategy (especially at this stage of the war when the Russian's are on their final-ish push), one that would have a chapter in future history books. Either way we'll probably find out after the war, or at least after the Russian offensive has run out of steam.",

This is extremely difficult and precarious.\n\nI think this argument is pretty solid.\n\n>Zelensky administration downplayed all warnings of invasion and was ill-prepared when the war did really start. \n\nThis one doesn't make much sense to me. Ukraine has been pretty obviously preparing for this invasion since 2014, and Zelensky didn't do anything to make Ukraine less prepared, as their generally solid response to the invasion demonstrated. The two things I imagine you might be talking about are the administration statements that they didn't think Russia would invade right before the invasion, and the collapse of the southern front.\n\nIt seems pretty straightforward to me that the southern front was an issue of Russian infiltration, and Russia tried to do the same thing everywhere - but largely failed, with the with being the only success. The enemy succeeding in one instance isn't really a sign of being ill-prepared.\n\nLikewise, given that Ukraine has been begging for arms for years, and successfully transformed an army that failed in 2014, it doesn't make sense to me to argue that they were ill-prepared because of a few statements.

This is extremely difficult and precarious.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I think this argument is pretty solid.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Zelensky administration downplayed all warnings of invasion and was ill-prepared when the war did really start. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This one doesn&#39;t make much sense to me. Ukraine has been pretty obviously preparing for this invasion since 2014, and Zelensky didn&#39;t do anything to make Ukraine less prepared, as their generally solid response to the invasion demonstrated. The two things I imagine you might be talking about are the administration statements that they didn&#39;t think Russia would invade right before the invasion, and the collapse of the southern front.</p>\n\n<p>It seems pretty straightforward to me that the southern front was an issue of Russian infiltration, and Russia tried to do the same thing everywhere - but largely failed, with the with being the only success. The enemy succeeding in one instance isn&#39;t really a sign of being ill-prepared.</p>\n\n<p>Likewise, given that Ukraine has been begging for arms for years, and successfully transformed an army that failed in 2014, it doesn&#39;t make sense to me to argue that they were ill-prepared because of a few statements. Those statements could demonstrate a misunderstanding of the situation or a mistaken belief in the best way to avoid panic, but calling them ill-prepared seems to be taking things entirely out of proportion.</p>\n</div>",

In the harder cases, explosives of various forms are often used as part of the firefighting process.\n\nAt the extreme end: In 1966, the USSR detonated a small nuclear device 1500m underground to stop a gas well fire that had been burning for 3 years and had resisted other attempt to put it out.\n\nhttps://interestingengineering.com/soviet-engineers-detonated-a-nuke-miles-underground-to-put-out-a-gas-well-fire",

Russia has slowly mobilized, so they went from their initial force of ~200k to probably around 300k total troops mobilized (ignoring all losses). \n\nAlso, Russia has roughly 3x the population of Ukraine, so on paper, Russia *should* be able to mobilize more troops in the long run than Ukraine. At least 3x. \n\nI think this is a wrong assessment. The reason being that Russia not only has to have soldiers, they also have to train and supply their soldiers with their own population. All of the supplies for the Russian military is probably backed up with 2-3x the support staff and probably another 2-3x the manufacturing base. So for one soldier, there is probably 4-6 people working to supply that soldier with the logistics. All of that artillery takes people, and those people are not free. \n\nUkraine, on the other hand, has leveraged the NATO manufacturing base for weapons. That frees up a lot of people to perform logistical support and/or infantry. They just have to take the weapons from Lviv to the front, instead of producing, testing, verifying, and then bringing the weapons from the factory in Russia to the front. \n\nAdditionally, with the NATO manufacturing base, Ukraine can leverage more sophisticated weapons. Weapons that take 10 people to produce and 1 person to deploy. Examples would be NLAWs. One NLAW costs roughly 30-40k. The represents about 1/4 man-year of NATO support. I'm sure each team member on a rocket squad will likely go through a lot more than 4 NLAWs in a year.

Sure, the politics in Russia are an uphill battle, and that's why Russia is fully mobilizing as quickly as they can without upsetting the population. But I actually think there is a practical problem too. \n\nRussia would probably need to mobilize something like a Million soldiers over the course of about 6 months-1 year in order to turn the tide of this war. Additionally, those soldiers would need approximately 3 million people in support staff from truck drivers to kitchen staff. Additionally, they'd need another 3 million people to support the war industry. That's roughly 7 million people. \n\nAnd to train all of those people in a short period of time, you'd need roughly 1/10 experts to teach them what they need to do in a short period of time. That would be 700k people. Experts in every aspect of wartime. First, Russia doesn't have those numbers. Second, those people are being killed off right now. Russia probably only has 20-50k people available for training right now. So the most you can expect to mobilize in a 6 month period is probably on the order of 200-500k soldiers. And that's if Russia had an efficient system, which they probably do not. \n\nYou can embed untrained people within trained units, but that only works if you have a small number of \"replacements\" and they get on the job training. Which is more or less what Russia is doing right now. But that will only replace the people who died with lower quality people. \n\nContrast that with Ukraine and NATO soldiers are basically doing nothing right now other than training. They currently have 1.2 million active personnel. Poland itself has 100k. If you take 1/10th of their best soldiers and focus on training, That's roughly 120k trainers. You are looking at 1.2 million fully training Ukrainians in roughly a year. In all aspects of warfare.  \n\nCurrently, information on Ukrainian soldiers being trained in NATO countries is quite sparse. Also, there will be a major language barrier. But there is already major evidence that this has been effective on two very public events. First, the deployment of M777 artillery and second, HIMARs. Both are indications that NATO training is paying off handsomely and Russia cannot counter that.",

They take a lot of very expensive engineers to develop and build. There are no shortcuts. \n\nNow China does have a cheap labor pool because they basically have death squads for anybody that goes against the state or corporation. But that cheap labor pool is slowly coming to an end as they are going to age out of working age and will retire. And they don't have retirement. So the parents will be supported by their kids. \n\nSo China is basically taking on a major generational debt that they'll be paying in about 10 years when a large portion of their workforce starts to retire. \n\nYou know we the same shit that is happening here in the USA due to boomers retiring causing a shortage of labor. Which was expected to happen for decades. \n\nSo given the above, China is possibly getting cheaper weapons by screwing their own population. That's not a formula developing sophisticated, effective weapons. Because engineering talent would rather leave. To the USA, Canada, Australia, or other free democracies. \n\nNow if we ignore that and say China is about to get the same weapons for half the price, I guarantee it's not the same capability.

But that 10-20% can be the difference between 1-1 kd ratio and a 15-1, especially when it comes to air warfare. Which will be the majority of the critical war between China and the USA. \n\nAll of that said, there is definitely a chance that China can beat the USA in a Taiwan conflict. Not now, but if China gets better capability in the air, it's definitely possible.

Rather many W Europeans, not all but especially on the left, would rather coexist with Russia. They see the path forward being to mellow Russia out through close contact and promoting democracy through soft means. Or they just want Russia to leave them alone and see Eastern Europe as a small price to pay for a happy, quiet Russia. Or, as in Germany, they place their own economic interests above that of resisting Russia. And it makes sense, if the oil and gas embargo last into the fall it\u2019ll be Germans paying for it. There is also a long post-World War Two tradition of pacifism above all else, especially in Germany. World War Two was a bad time for Europe, even the victors, and the Cold War wasn\u2019t much better. Many would rather see Eastern Europe burn before they would risk a confrontation which would end up with Germany divided again, or yet another dictator marching through Paris. \n\nThe US&UK were always the driving force behind the anti-Russia block.

Rather many W Europeans, not all but especially on the left, would rather coexist with Russia. They see the path forward being to mellow Russia out through close contact and promoting democracy through soft means. Or they just want Russia to leave them alone and see Eastern Europe as a small price to pay for a happy, quiet Russia. Or, as in Germany, they place their own economic interests above that of resisting Russia. And it makes sense, if the oil and gas embargo last into the fall it\u2019ll be Germans paying for it. There is also a long post-World War Two tradition of pacifism above all else, especially in Germany. World War Two was a bad time for Europe, even the victors, and the Cold War wasn\u2019t much better. Many would rather see Eastern Europe burn before they would risk a confrontation which would end up with Germany divided again, or yet another dictator marching through Paris. </p>\n\n<p>The US&amp;UK were always the driving force behind the anti-Russia block. They pulled Europe together in the 1940s, and they kept Europe together even when Ostpolitik and De Gaullism threatened to pull it apart.</p>\n</div>",

Their goal is to support division and things that weaken their opponents, especially the US.\n\nSo for example, gun issues divide Americans, so they support the NRA.

And they don't just, or even primarily, fund divisive organizations, they push messages through ads and social media that are specifically calculated to anger the other side. So the next time you find a dumb, infuriating meme on social media, it's worth wondering whether it's organic or created for the purpose of making you hate the other side.

Rumor is Trump planned to leave NATO if he won reelection. Unclear if that's true, but he was clearly hostile to the idea of NATO and multilateral relationships generally, and was driving divisions between the US and Europe, which Russia would see as a positive.\n\nI think your point about Russian aggression under democratic presidents actually cuts against your argument. The general conclusion I see people draw when they bring they up is that Russia is intimidated by strong Republicans and takes advantage of weak Democrats. However, neither Republicans nor Democrats have offered serious resistance to Russian ambitions, as Trump's generally ineffectual actions in Syria demonstrated.\n\nI think the more evidence driven explanation for why Russia generally stayed quieter during Trump's presidency is that you don't get in your enemy's way when they are making a mistake. Trump was pissing off the Europeans and dividing America, the last thing Russia would want to do is be an aggressive external threat that would remind Americans and Europeans that there is a reason they work together. \n\nSo the real question is not whether a president is a republican or a democrat, but whether they are an isolationist or want to project power abroad, whether they are uniting or dividing Russia's enemies (and whether they are effectively accomplishing their goals)",

I'm sorry but you can't win a war begging others to give you everything. Sooner or later the internal support for helping Ukraine will collapse in the Western countries. Ukraine even want other countries to train their own Ukrainian troops. I have never heard of anyone winning a war against an opponent as strong as Russia relying exclusively on foreign support. The Russians have absolutely everything on their side except the potential manpower. They have lots of equipment, they can build new equipment in their own country since their industry is not bombed, they have plenty of resources, they have plenty of money so they can even buy new equipment from other countries. Their population support the war since they are winning right now and their country is not bombed. They are a dictatorship so they can arrest anyone who opposes the war. Their only weakness is the manpower, but that is just temporary since Russia has 3-4 times the population of Ukraine and can easily rectify this problem if they feel like they need more troops. The Russians can lose the war only if other countries enter the war on the Ukrainian side. Maybe a coalition of Ukraine, Poland, Romania, Baltic States, could win the war, but that will never happen. Ukraine is and will remain alone in this war.",
