After all, the mother of all escalations (nuclear warfare) is essentially a promise to credibly *commit suicide* if certain lines are crossed.\n\nInstead escalation is basically a question of signalling *wills* which often leads to decisions which at the time are viewed as *unavoidable* but in the future are viewed as *absolutely disastrous* (Germany's decision to unleash U-boats in WW1, Pearl Harbour, etc.).

Heavy shelling has left the city almost completely destroyed.\n\n>\u201cIt is a brutal and grinding fight,\u201d a senior Western intelligence official said last week, with each side exchanging anywhere from 100-400 meters of land per day and exchanging several thousands of artillery rounds almost daily. \u201c[Bakhmut] is less attractive militarily, in terms of any sort of infrastructure, than it might have been if it had not been this destroyed.\u201d\n\n>Now, ahead of what is widely expected to be a brutal spring of fighting, there is a tactical opening, US and Western officials say. **In recent weeks they have begun suggesting that Ukrainian forces cut their losses in Bakhmut**, which they argue has little strategic significance for Ukraine, and focus instead on planning an offensive in the south.\n\n>That was part of a message delivered by three top Biden officials who traveled to Kyiv last week.\n\n>In a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, deputy national security adviser Jon Finer, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, and Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl, said the US wants to help Ukraine shift away from the sort of pitched battle of attrition playing out in Bakhmut and focus instead on a style of mechanized maneuver warfare that uses rapid, unanticipated movements against Russia, sources familiar with their discussion said.\n\n>The hundreds of armored vehicles the US and European countries have provided to Ukraine in recent weeks, including 14 British tanks, are meant to help Ukraine make that shift, officials said.\n\n>>Convincing Zelensky\n\n>It is not clear, however, that Zelensky feels prepared to abandon Bakhmut.\n\n>People familiar with his thinking tell CNN that **Zelensky does not believe that a Russian victory in Bakhmut is a fait accompli**, and that he remains reluctant to give it up. Holding Bakhmut would give Ukraine a better chance at taking back the entire Donbas region, Zelensky believes, and that if Russia wins, it will give them an opening to advance further to the strategically important eastern cities of Slovyansk and Kramatorsk.\n\n>Bakhmut is also an important symbol of Ukrainian resistance.\n\n>Zelensky visited Bakhmut just before traveling to Washington DC last December, where he told US lawmakers that \u201cevery inch of that land is soaked in blood, roaring guns sound every hour. The fight for Bakhmut will change the tragic story of our war for independence and of freedom.\u201d\n\n>In short, the senior Western official said, Bakhmut \u201cmatters because the Russians have made it matter \u2014 probably more than the terrain does.\u201d A US military official also expressed skepticism that Ukraine will abandon Bakhmut \u2014 not because of its battlefield value, but because its strategic messaging value is so important.\n\n>There are also some benefits to trying to exhaust the Russians in Bakhmut.\n\n>On Monday, a senior US military official told reporters that **Russia has \u201crushed in\u201d tens of thousands of \u201cill-equipped, ill-trained\u201d replacement troops across the front line over the last several months, including to Bakhmut, amid the losses suffered. Despite the large numbers, the new troops have not changed the dynamic of the fight**, the official said.\n\n>But Ukraine is also suffering enormous casualties in the battle and expending tremendous amounts of artillery ammunition daily \u2013 a style of fighting that the **US does not believe is sustainable**. In terms of sheer volume, Russia still has more artillery ammunition and manpower, with the paramilitary organization Wagner Group using thousands of convicts to \u201cthrow bodies\u201d at the battle, the Western intelligence official said.\n\n>US officials are hoping the latest delivery of armored equipment and the newly expanded training for Ukrainian forces in Germany will encourage Ukraine to shift its tactics.\n\n>\u201cDepending on the delivery and training of all of this equipment, I do think it\u2019s very, very possible for the Ukrainians to run a significant tactical or even operational level, offensive operation to liberate as much Ukrainian territory as possible,\u201d Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley told reporters on Friday.\n\n>>Putin\u2019s calculations\n\n>The push for Ukraine to shift its battlefield tactics comes amid signs that Russian President Vladimir Putin is weighing making a big move in the next several weeks to regain the initiative in the war, officials familiar with the intelligence told CNN.\n\n>CIA Director Bill Burns traveled to Kyiv earlier this month **to brief Zelensky on the US assessment of Putin\u2019s plans**, sources familiar with their conversation told CNN.\n\n>**There are also indications that Putin is considering another troop mobilization of as many as 200,000 men**, US and Western officials familiar with the intelligence told CNN.\n\n>The Kremlin has begun to conduct polling domestically to gauge the popularity of another mobilization, two officials said. The next mobilization, some believe, would be quieter compared to the first one, when Putin himself made a televised announcement, calling it a \u201cpartial mobilization.\u201d\n\n>Putin is aware of how unpopular the first mobilization was late last year, when protests erupted and hundreds of thousands of Russian fighting age men fled the country to escape conscription, the officials said, and he has yet to make a decision on another mobilization effort.\n\n>But Russia continues to need bodies to throw at the fight. The first mobilization nearly doubled Russia\u2019s troop presence in Ukraine \u2013 even if it produced fighters that were untrained and undisciplined \u2013 and overall, sources familiar with US and Western intelligence said, Putin\u2019s grip on power remains secure.\n\n>\u201cWe don\u2019t think Putin has yet made up his mind, particularly with regard to when to do it,\u201d the senior Western intelligence official said, \u201cbecause he almost certainly is concerned about societal blowback and negative economic repercussions.\u201d\n\n>>\u2018Nothing but a meat grinder\u2019\n\n>Putin\u2019s intentions for a new offensive became clearer to Western officials earlier this month when he elevated General Valery Gerasimov, chief of the Russian General Staff, to become the overall commander of the war, the officials said.\n\n>Gerasimov, who symbolizes Russia\u2019s early failures in the war, **is eager to prove that he can turn the tide of the conflict**, and is pushing for a fresh offensive to retake territory in the east and south.\n\n>\u201cI have no doubt that Gerasimov feels to the very fiber of his being that he had better launch an offensive in the spring \u2013 so one will come,\u201d the Western intelligence official said.\n\n>Some senior Russian military officials have even been overheard in recent weeks discussing the possibility of trying to capture the northeastern city of Kharkiv, according to people familiar with the conversations intercepted by Western and Ukrainian intelligence.\n\n>But US and Western officials and military analysts told CNN that Kharkiv \u2013 a major city that was held by the Ukrainians last fall following a surprise counteroffensive \u2013 **does not appear to be a remotely achievable target for the Russian military**. As much as Putin would like to try to target Kyiv again, officials say, that too is currently out of his forces\u2019 reach.\n\n>As CNN has reported, Russia\u2019s artillery fire has declined dramatically from its wartime high, in some places by as much as 75%, in a likely sign that the Russians has been forced to ration ammunition.\n\n>That could be a huge problem for Russia if it wants to launch a big new offensive against major cities, noted one military expert.\n\n>It is more likely, officials said, that Russia will continue to focus most of its attention on taking more territory in the Donbas region \u2013 with Bakhmut as a potential springboard \u2013 and in the Zaporizhzhia region, where the Ukrainian military reported on Saturday that Russian forces were already beginning to step up hostilities.\n\n>Russia is intent upon keeping its \u201cland bridge\u201d from its Rostov region to Crimea, officials said, and needs to maintain its southern Ukrainian holdings to do so.\n\n>\u201cA major Ukrainian breakthrough in Zaporizhzhia would seriously challenge the viability of Russia\u2019s \u2018land-bridge\u2019 linking Russia\u2019s Rostov region and Crimea,\u201d the UK Ministry of Defense reported in its regular intelligence update earlier this month.\n\n>**Broadly, though, the US and its allies are skeptical of Russia\u2019s ability to mount a serious offensive.**\n\n>\u201c[I] doubt very much, given what we\u2019ve seen of the Russian ability to mobilize, man, train and equip effectively, that it is going to be anything different than what we\u2019ve already seen,\u201d said the Western intelligence official. \u201cAnd what we\u2019ve already seen is nothing but a meat grinder.\u201d",

As much as Putin would like to try to target Kyiv again, officials say, that too is currently out of his forces\u2019 reach.</p>\n\n<p>As CNN has reported, Russia\u2019s artillery fire has declined dramatically from its wartime high, in some places by as much as 75%, in a likely sign that the Russians has been forced to ration ammunition.</p>\n\n<p>That could be a huge problem for Russia if it wants to launch a big new offensive against major cities, noted one military expert.</p>\n\n<p>It is more likely, officials said, that Russia will continue to focus most of its attention on taking more territory in the Donbas region \u2013 with Bakhmut as a potential springboard \u2013 and in the Zaporizhzhia region, where the Ukrainian military reported on Saturday that Russian forces were already beginning to step up hostilities.</p>\n\n<p>Russia is intent upon keeping its \u201cland bridge\u201d from its Rostov region to Crimea, officials said, and needs to maintain its southern Ukrainian holdings to do so.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cA major Ukrainian breakthrough in Zaporizhzhia would seriously challenge the viability of Russia\u2019s \u2018land-bridge\u2019 linking Russia\u2019s Rostov region and Crimea,\u201d the UK Ministry of Defense reported in its regular intelligence update earlier this month.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Broadly, though, the US and its allies are skeptical of Russia\u2019s ability to mount a serious offensive.</strong></p>\n\n<p>\u201c[I] doubt very much, given what we\u2019ve seen of the Russian ability to mobilize, man, train and equip effectively, that it is going to be anything different than what we\u2019ve already seen,\u201d said the Western intelligence official. \u201cAnd what we\u2019ve already seen is nothing but a meat grinder.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Funnily enough, the person I speak the most with about defense issues is my mom, but this is a function of us engaging too much in political hobbyism for our own good.</p>\n</div>",

A finding that Chinese companies were supporting the invasion would have troubling implications on US policy toward both Russia and China.  \n>  \n>The US strategy over Ukraine rests in part on isolating President Vladimir Putin\u2019s government and seeking to choke off his economy and hinder the war effort. Increased support from China, the world\u2019s second-biggest economy, could significantly undercut that strategy.  \n>  \n>And if Biden and his advisers determined China\u2019s government was involved in or tacitly accepted the actions of those state-owned enterprises, they would be forced to decide how much to push back. That could risk opening a whole new area of dispute at a time when the US has sought to balance its desire for stabilized ties with Beijing against moves to limit Chinese access to high-end mircochips and confront China over what it sees as a more aggressive posture toward Taiwan.  \n>  \n>Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen met Vice Premier Liu He last week and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is set to visit Beijing in February, the first such visit since the Covid-19 outbreak shut down travel in early 2020.  \n>  \n>Russia and China declared a \u201cno limits\u201d relationship before the war and US officials believe that China initially intended to sell lethal weapons to Russia for use in the battlefield. But the administration views China as having scaled back that plan and argues it isn\u2019t doing as much as it could to help Putin\u2019s invasion, the people said.  \n>  \n>The administration believes China\u2019s government wants to help Russia and isn\u2019t neutral as it claims, according to the people. China has also deepened its trade relationship despite US demands that other nations distance themselves from the Russian economy.  \n>  \n>China on principle rejects any sanctions apart from those agreed at the United Nations, and views American calls on other countries to restrict trade as a violation of sovereignty. China\u2019s imports from Russia grew by nearly 50% from a year earlier in 2022, while exports rose 13%.  \n>  \n>There are thousands of state-owned enterprises in China, some directly controlled by the central government with chief executives who rank equal to ministers and others that are subject to less direct supervision.

        "body": "A useful article from *Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung* summarising recent developments in the latest attempt to resolve Serbia-Kosovo relations.\n\n>Germany, France, the USA and the EU are getting serious: Americans and Europeans want to use all their might to resolve the conflict between Serbia and Kosovo. The ulterior motive: while the democratic world of states resists Moscow's war against Ukraine, open flanks are to be closed elsewhere.\n\n>In Europe, threats to stability emanate not least from the ongoing feud between Belgrade and Prishtina, which has flared up at irregular intervals for years. Most recently, in December 2022, a bloody conflict seemed dangerously close. In the dispute over control of northern Kosovo, barricades were erected, soldiers deployed, and troops from NATO countries stationed in Kosovo moved out.\n\n>Although the situation has been defused, the cause of the conflict remains: Supported by Russia and China, Serbia does not recognize Kosovo 's independence, which was proclaimed in 2008, and is blocking the young state's admission to international organizations such as the United Nations. De facto, however, Belgrade no longer controls the majority of Kosovo and can only assert its own claim to power in northern Kosovo, which is almost exclusively populated by Serbs.\n\n>**German-German basic treaty as a model?**\n\n>In the hope of being able to defuse the causes of the conflict, Germany, France and the EU brought a solution into play last year that has been haunting Western foreign offices and government offices in simulation games for many years.\n\n>It is associated with the name of the former top German diplomat and head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger. In October 2007, in an interview with the FAZ, he suggested using the German-German basic treaty of 1972 as a model in order to exclude the unsolvable and still reach agreement. Similar to what the GDR and the Federal Republic did back then, Serbia and Kosovo should not recognize each other de jure, but de facto, in order to remove the basis for conflicts.\n\n>In September 2022, Jens Pl\u00f6tner, foreign policy adviser to Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz, as well as his French counterpart Emmanuel Bonne and Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k, the EU special representative for the dialogue between Belgrade and Prishtina, traveled to the Balkans with this idea. First they presented the concept to Kosovo's Prime Minister Albin Kurti, then to Serbia's President Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107 in Belgrade . They returned on Friday, now accompanied by Joe Biden's Balkan representative, Gabriel Escobar.\n\n>The meetings with Kurti and Vu\u010di\u0107 each lasted more than two hours. In addition to the details of a possible agreement, the intricacies of which should not be underestimated, a fundamental question was at stake: Are Serbia and Kosovo prepared to accept the Western proposal as the basis for a solution? Are they willing and able to make rapid progress? Then Scholz and Emmanuel Macron would also get involved directly in the final phase. Their intermediaries have ambitious ideas. It should not take years, but if possible only months, until an agreement is reached.\n\n>As far as we can learn from Belgrade, Prishtina and other sources, however, anyone who thinks this is achievable must be very confident. Albin Kurti is being asked to allow the formation of a network of Serb communities and enclaves in Kosovo. Although he is even obliged to do so according to a decision by the Kosovan constitutional court, he stubbornly refuses to allow the merger, with various reasons.\n\n>Apparently, Kurti set a precondition for the Western mediators: In order to accept their proposed solution, he needed a guarantee that the five EU states that have not yet recognized Kosovo will do so later. This should be included in the solution plan.\n\n>The quintet from Spain, Greece, Slovakia, Romania and Cyprus does not recognize Kosovo for domestic reasons. In the case of Athens and possibly Madrid as well, a change of course seems conceivable. At the other end of the spectrum is Cyprus.\n\n>From there it is heard that they will not recognize Kosovo in view of the division of their own country even if Serbia does so. But even if this is not the last word, the European mediators cannot speak on behalf of non-recognizers, least of all in the form of guarantees. Kurti was told that one could make every effort to persuade the five states to change their minds.\n\n>**Empty-handed salesmen**\n\n>Its refusal to accept the European proposal with a kiss on the hand is not surprising. In both Prishtina and Belgrade, intermediaries are seen as empty-handed traveling salesmen. They cannot offer the prospect of EU membership - a goal that once unleashed considerable reform energies in the region. The case of North Macedonia is unforgettable in the Balkans. Although the state even changed its name to resolve a dispute with Greece and move forward towards the EU, today it is blocked by Bulgaria.\n\n>The region suspects that there is always some EU state that gives the thumbs-up when it comes to accepting new members. Kosovo experiences this with the comparatively harmless desire for membership in the Council of Europe, where many obstacles are put in the way of the state, which despite all its shortcomings is a functioning democracy with peaceful changes of power and media critical of the government. Assurances that Russia's war has changed everything are not believed in the region.\n\n>Not even in Belgrade. Vu\u010di\u0107 has never renounced the goal of EU membership. He wants to keep the attractive-sounding status of an EU accession candidate that Serbia has held since 2012. However, for years he has repeatedly spoken negatively (and in small circles downright sarcastically) about the realism of the EU enlargement policy. In a speech in Belgrade in October 2018: \u201cDo you really think anyone cares?\u201d he asked a Western audience during an appearance at a regional security conference with a view to the possible opening of new chapters in the EU accession negotiations. \"Even my ministers in the room are laughing about it,\" Vu\u010di\u0107 scoffed. \"Do you really think that's news to the people here? No, that would not be the case. Because nobody knows what happens after that.\u201d\n\n>**The location is convenient for Vu\u010di\u0107**\n\n>The \"European perspective\" is much less attractive in the Balkans than people think in Brussels, since no one really knows what it means beyond a turning point that is only perceived as rhetorical. Kurti is said to have heard from Western mediators: \"It's not enough to be a good person and to be right. You also have to be a good team player.\u201d But he doesn't seem to trust the team. Some want to know that not all five missing recognitions are necessary for Kurti - if Greece and Spain lead the way, that would be enough to show something.\n\n>For Vu\u010di\u0107, the situation is quite comfortable. As long as Kurti is presented as a spoilsport, he can pretend that he agrees with the proposal. But according to Belgrade, Vu\u010di\u0107 will also not invest political capital in a project whose advocates cannot convincingly explain to him what he gains from it.\n\nhttps://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/ausland/wie-die-eu-den-streit-zwischen-dem-kosovo-und-serbien-beilegen-will-18621231.html",

They&#39;re so out numbered !&quot; </p>\n\n<p>Mate, it&#39;s called the vanguard. </p>\n\n<p>As shown by the rest of Ukraine, 10000s of troops are very capable of creating operational control over a vast region including surrounding the capital. Which is what the airport was for. </p>\n\n<p>If necessary; Russia could pour in extra soldiers. </p>\n\n<p>They very clearly demonstrated their ability to pull in the rest of the professional forces in the months following the invasion before resorting to mobilization.</p>\n\n<p>Please go read some sources instead of memes about this. It was incredibly planned out, and while based on faulty assumptions in many cases, that doesn&#39;t mean they didn&#39;t plan it out, or try.</p>\n</div>",

Whoever it is is screwed, those manning the defenses are going to get nailed by artillery in very heavy amounts for extended periods and then have to repel attack after attack, each one getting a better picture of UA defenses, each one weakening it a bit more.  \n\nTDF are basically light infantry and don't even possess organic artillery. Most are poorly trained, their chain of command gets the dregs, their equipment varies at best, etc. They shouldn't be manning any front line positions besides quiet sectors, especially due to lack of organic fires. If they do go into important sectors, it's probably better to break those units up and just attach the infantry companies to other UAF unit types and have them use them as best they can.\n\nI'll divide up \"mid tier infantry\" maneuver units between two types. One lacks IFV (Airborne or Airmobile brigades, National Guard), and thus are unable to perform proper counterattacks, which are absolutely essential for proper defensive operations (counterattack at every opportunity, to not only retake lost ground but to keep the enemy unbalanced). The other types are those of mixed effectiveness, most likely because they took heavy casualties at some point and aren't really that combat effective anymore. \n\nThe mech infantry, air assault, and tank brigades, plus mountain and Jaeger supposedly too, are all mechanized with IFV, though only mech and tank have all self propelled artillery too. Tank brigades are ridiculously heavy with tanks and very light on infantry, so shouldn't hold the main line, but be held back as either an intact reserve or have the battalions detached to support other units. Mech infantry are probably the most versatile units, as they are heavy with mech infantry, have a tank battalion, and lots of self propelled artillery. The same quality that makes them potent offensive tools is the same that applies to defensive ops too, especially when it comes to counterattacks, which are paramount for defensive op. During those, infantry need protected mobility, they need tank support, they need organic artillery that's mobile and protected. And any defense without counterattacks done at every opportunity is a shitty defense. \n\nSo if the UAF really wants to hold ground, they should be using their quality units. \n\nThat said, the benefit of using those units is they're more capable. The negative is they're useful enough that it's wasteful to lose them fighting a meat grinder battle. \n\nThese issues are the repercussions of the UAF's decision to try to defend sectors against the Russians doing set piece fires heavy attacks with no regard for casualties. The pro to the decision is the UAF are causing heavy Russian casualties and either dramatically slowing down their rate of advance or even preventing them. The cons are that it's losing the best Ukrainians to kill some of the worst Russians so it's a shitty trade off and extremely costly, it still often fails and despite the commitment the Ukrainians are losing ground they fully intended to hold until hell froze over, and that's because tactically and operationally it's playing to the Russian strengths. \n\nWhat's an alternative? [This, the mobile defense](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-90/ch10.htm).\n\n>The mobile defense is a type of defensive operation that concentrates on the destruction or defeat of the enemy through a decisive attack by a striking force. It focuses on destroying the attacking force by permitting the enemy to advance into a position that exposes him to counterattack and envelopment. The commander holds the majority of his available combat power in a striking force for his decisive operation, a major counterattack.\n\nI'm not suggesting that isn't without risk, everything has pro and cons. Done incorrectly or just with very bad luck it could be disastrous. And with Russia using bite and hold tactics in the Donbas, they might not even bite at the bait. However, it was promoted by the West especially to use against the Soviet Union, and Russia who still uses the same basic tactics, because NATO couldn't trade losses, they needed to use maneuver as a force multiplier. Considering how badly the Russians can perform maneuver warfare now, they're ripe for it. \n\nUkraine should know this, most of its successes in the war came down to maneuver related victories, either they outmaneuvered the Russians (Kharkiv counteroffensive 1 and 2) or the Russians fucked themselves so badly they nearly outmaneuvered themselves, allowing minimal Ukraine resistance and counterattacks to push them to the brink of collapse (Kyiv-Chernihiv-Sumy late March).",
