You don't really want to go there in peacetime, and there is a point where, if it's not urgent, building a new factory is more cost effective to satisfy increased long-term demand than running your existing factories at the limit of their capacities.\n\nSo you probably only get small benefits in efficiency from buying more in peacetime before you start building more factories. And you have to take into account that ammunition doesn't last forever, and (unless you are Russia or possibly North Korea) you want to keep your stockpile decently fresh. So if you stockpile more during peacetime, you incur costs from having to store the additional ammunition in good condition and replace what gets too old. \n\nI'm not even sure the chosen approach was, overall, less cost efficient than maintaining a larger stockpile in peacetime.

        "body": "An article that gives some production numbers for long range strike drones.  The original source is in Ukrainian.  And the source of the numbers could be pumping up the numbers for propaganda purposes but we see the effects of the strikes.  \n\n[Ukraine Produces as Many Shahed-136 Analogs as Russia: What Quantity is Mentioned? | Defense Express | May 2024](https://en.defence-ua.com/industries/ukraine_produces_as_many_shahed_136_analogs_as_russia_what_quantity_is_mentioned-10444.html)\n\n*Herman Smetanin, CEO of Ukrainian Defense Industry, announced that the Ukrainian defense sector has already caught up with Russia in the production pace of long-range kamikaze drones like Shahed-136, as well as in the production of other strike drones.*\n\n*According to his words, as cited by [ArmyInform](https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/05/08/ukrayina-suttyevo-narostyla-vyrobnycztvo-boyeprypasiv-intervyu-armiyainform-z-gendyrektorom-at-ukroboronprom/), this was achieved through licensed production of drones from private companies at the facilities of state-owned enterprises. And such a mechanism has been implemented not only regarding UAVs but also other types of armament and military equipment.*\n\n*In Russia, Shahed-136 drones are currently being assembled at a rate of 330-350 per month. However, it's worth noting that the discussion does not encompass the entire production cycle, as Russia actively imports a significant portion of components, including engines.*\n\n*It should be noted that currently, two production lines for manufacturing enclosures are operating in Alabuga, in the Republic of Tatarstan. At the same enterprise, they fill them with imported units and aggregates, as well as with some components of Russian production, such as combat parts.

And the source of the numbers could be pumping up the numbers for propaganda purposes but we see the effects of the strikes.  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.defence-ua.com/industries/ukraine_produces_as_many_shahed_136_analogs_as_russia_what_quantity_is_mentioned-10444.html\">Ukraine Produces as Many Shahed-136 Analogs as Russia: What Quantity is Mentioned? | Defense Express | May 2024</a></p>\n\n<p><em>Herman Smetanin, CEO of Ukrainian Defense Industry, announced that the Ukrainian defense sector has already caught up with Russia in the production pace of long-range kamikaze drones like Shahed-136, as well as in the production of other strike drones.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>According to his words, as cited by <a href=\"https://armyinform.com.ua/2024/05/08/ukrayina-suttyevo-narostyla-vyrobnycztvo-boyeprypasiv-intervyu-armiyainform-z-gendyrektorom-at-ukroboronprom/\">ArmyInform</a>, this was achieved through licensed production of drones from private companies at the facilities of state-owned enterprises. And such a mechanism has been implemented not only regarding UAVs but also other types of armament and military equipment.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>In Russia, Shahed-136 drones are currently being assembled at a rate of 330-350 per month. However, it&#39;s worth noting that the discussion does not encompass the entire production cycle, as Russia actively imports a significant portion of components, including engines.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>It should be noted that currently, two production lines for manufacturing enclosures are operating in Alabuga, in the Republic of Tatarstan. At the same enterprise, they fill them with imported units and aggregates, as well as with some components of Russian production, such as combat parts. But the enemy&#39;s plans include fully localizing production by 2026</em></p>\n\n<p><em>There are also unconfirmed reports that in the Alabuga Special Economic Zone (SEZ) aims to achieve a production rate of around 800 Shaheds per month, as evidenced by declared plans for component procurement.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>However, according to the CEO of Ukrainian Defense Industry, Ukraine has achieved more than a significant pace in the production of long-range drones.

If the answer is \"don't go into Gaza\", what would have been the appropriate response from Israel in order to eliminate Hamas as a fighting force, return the hostages, and prevent further security breaches? \n\nKeeping in mind that based on the limited polling we have from within Palestine, Hamas enjoyed widespread support that has only increased in the wake of October 7th, I'm skeptical that even an unrealistically pacifist approach would have enjoyed significantly improved chances of success at defanging Hamas.

Yet, they don't have any kind of local administration to work with to distribute aid, prevent lawlessness, rebuild housing, resettle refugees from other parts of Gaza, etc. In fact, for some reason the US has had to provide food aid to (a heavily depopulated) Northern Gaza despite Israel being responsible by law to provide civilians with basic human necessities in areas that they control. \n\nThere also doesn't seem to be any kind of longterm strategy either. For example, the vast majority of the population of the territory has relocated to Rafah. Israel plans to attack and capture Rafah. So where exactly are the refugees in Rafah supposed to go now that most of the housing in Gaza has been leveled and most of the public infrastructure (sanitation, running water, food distribution) has been destroyed? Why hasn't Israel prepared for a large-scale return of civilians to Northern Gaza?\n\nThe longer the conflict goes on and the more inclined I am to believe that this conflict really is more about ethnic cleansing and punishing Palestinians in general rather than returning the hostages and eliminating the threat posed by Hamas.

Once October 7th was over and the IDF started actually doing it&#39;s job Israel was under minimal actual threat, and I think this is borne out by the fact that they could afford to wait weeks before actually beginning operations in Gaza. I think they certainly could have taken more time plan and conduct their operations in a manor that would have reduced civilian casualties, properly meet their obligations as an occupying force, and actually articulate a coherent position on post-war governance in Gaza.</p>\n</div>",

Even with cluster munitions that don't need precision, the demands for artillery has been WAY more than 100k/mo.\n\nThe question of air superiority is a very different one. Our military superiority complex knows no bounds. F-35 and F-22 are very visible on low-frequency radar from hundreds of miles away. They won't be targeted from that one angle with the tiny radar cross-section, but will be hit with many radars from many angles trying to hit the highest radar returns. We abandoned the YF-23's hidden exhaust style in favor of exposed exhaust, so our planes have massive IR signatures too. There's a reason we've pushed NGAD so hard and it goes beyond repair logistics.\n\nIn any case, if there were a NATO v Russia war, all major air bases and carriers on both sides would be eliminated in the opening salvos as Russia would definitely go straight to tactical nukes and we would retaliate in like kind.\n\nIf we talk about the more likely US v China (where nukes will be reserved until there is a clear loser), our planes don't have the range to take on missions without risking the sinking of our carriers. Meanwhile, our nearby airbases would likely be destroyed by saturation missile barrages.

Nothing that has happened in Gaza has swayed me in the slightest in this regard and I fully support the basic Israeli position, and surprisingly the vast majority of people I know also do so.\n\n- I don\u2019t care if the victory is messy, I don\u2019t believe clean victories are available in 2024\n\n- if Zionism can be isolated and focused for criticism, so can Palestinianism / Islam / Anti-Zionism\n\n- conquering Hamas in every city, to the point of surrender and/or destruction, is the obvious mechanism of victory, with the post-victory plan being a fully separate object\n\nAnd yet I find myself (I am an American Democrat, for context) agreeing with Biden based partially on the following:\n\nImagine you were bibi and you were TRYING to force Biden to break from Israel. How would you? What about the following:\n\n1. Actively interfere in internal American politics against the ruling party (disrupting internal politics of your \u2018ally\u2019 entirely voluntarily)\n\n2. Actively undermine the secondary foreign policy goals of your ally (making US relations with Egypt/SA/Jordan etc easier)\n\n3. Actively spurn your ally in relatively free helpful scenarios (giving authorization to supply Israeli-sold weapons in Europe to Ukraine, signing on to multilateral condemnations or sanctions on enemies)\u2026 (please do not respond to this by suggesting that 50 russian mercenaries in Syria have deterred a country with F-35s and nukes)\n\n4. Draw out war scenarios with seemingly deliberate aims at American election timing\n\n5. Refusing to specify any comprehensive plan, whether true or false or a placeholder, that could be pointed to by Biden as a reasonable plan that he is simply supporting an ally in conducting\n\n6.

Act against illegal Palestinian construction in area C (Israeli civilian control under Oslo accords).\n\n13.

                "body": "Hi P.C., firstly -- I have read your comments every day on here throughout this entire war and I agree with nearly 100% of what you say in them. I find that you and OpenOB add a really valuable Israeli perspective and knowledge base to these threads. I am describing my own opinions here in detail because I think I might be representative of a group that you don't have enough exposure to to understand. It should make you pause at least for a second when you hear that someone who actually agrees with you on so much has a totally different understanding of this new development. That is in fact why I chose to comment on this issue.\n\nTo American democrats it is really disheartening to see that Israeli issues are becoming the perfect wedge issue for Republicans and Trump to get the extra few % of the votes that they would need to win the coming election. It isn't Israel's fault that the democratic coalition isn't united/correct on Israeli policy issues of course. But anyways, democrats really see Trump winning as an incredibly insane/dangerous/harmful outcome. It really dominates a lot of our thinking. I'm sure you are pretty familiar with Trump details but just as a reminder, his winning would mean the wholesale reversal of Ukraine support, the United States becoming at least temporarily part of some odd axis of strongmen-run countries a la Putin/Orban/Erdogan/Modi, a permanent blow to international climate change efforts, etc and this does not even touch on domestic policies which would arguably have even wilder results. So for one thing, any balancing that democrats could do between Israel and winning the election just really leads to a lot of reservations about losing too much political capital on Israeli issues. And any impression that Israel is actively helping Trump win is the kind of thing that should really be considered an unforgivable red line. You may remember that Russia actually did this and it was the focus of democrats for years... I am just describing factors in democrats' feelings here so admittedly not some logical framework but possibly helpful for you to hear. One of the most salient things you have emphasized in your own posts is the domestic political mood in Israel and the trauma and determination of the Israeli people and how that governs their political leaders actions more than any outside forces could.\n\nYou are the only user who actually answered my hypothetical question. I honestly think it is a problem that Americans would have a tough time answering it as well as you did. That partly proves my point. To Americans it really feels like Netanyahu is just dunking on Biden non-stop for no reason and twisting the knife into Biden's election prospects. If you compare Zelensky's treatment of republicans versus Netanyahu's treatment of democrats it really shows the difference. There is no \"Trump heart Wagner\" tweeting coming from Zelensky's administration even though republicans have been 500% more harmful to Ukraine in their war than democrats have been to Israel.\n\nThe individual examples you listed have some validity but it's pretty debatable. Most of those things were non-discretionary or actions in Israel's interest rather than being actual olive branches.\n\nEven while holding my view on this it is hard to say whether Biden's new policy is a good idea or a warranted reaction. But it's almost as though something had to give. And obviously his policy isn't just a reaction to the feelings I've described here.\n\nAnd by the way, I do agree that Israel should continue to destroy Hamas including in Rafah. Biden might also agree, I'm not sure. He is stuck in lose-lose decisions that Netanyahu has not managed to give him much help with.",
