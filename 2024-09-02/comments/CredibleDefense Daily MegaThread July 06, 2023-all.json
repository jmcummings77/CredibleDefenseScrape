If it takes X amount of normal shells to advance on a position, and cluster munitions are 6X more efficient, then you can use X/6 fewer cluster munitions to achieve the same objective... with similar amounts of UXO left over, because you used less in the first place with cluster munitions, but cluster munitions are many times more likely to leave UXO.",

        "body": "[Russia Eyes Chechens and Convicts to Fill Gaps Left by Wagner](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-04/russia-eyes-chechens-and-convicts-to-fill-gaps-left-by-wagner)\n\n> Russia is preparing to send more Chechen fighters and convicts to Ukraine to fill holes left by Wagner mercenaries that were pulled from the battlefield, European intelligence officials believe.\n\n> With Ukraine reporting its counteroffensive advancing toward the eastern city of Bakhmut, Russian units risk being overstretched, according to the officials, who asked not to be identified because the information isn\u2019t public. Russia deployed large numbers of troops to Bakhmut after Wagner announced its withdrawal from the city in late May, leaving shortages in occupied areas of southern Ukraine, the officials said.\n\n> The insurrection by Wagner founder Yevgeny Prigozhin that spiraled into the biggest threat to President Vladimir Putin\u2019s 24-year rule has deprived Russian forces of some of their most battle-hardened troops in Ukraine. The Defense Ministry in Moscow has given no indication so far of how many mercenaries signed contracts to join the military by a July 1 deadline. Prigozhin accused Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu of attempting to \u201cdestroy\u201d Wagner with the demand.\n\n> Ukraine said last week that Wagner forces are unlikely to reappear on the battlefield in any significant numbers. Ukrainian military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov told the Ukrainska Pravda news outlet the group was \u201cthe most efficient Russian unit, which was able to achieve success at any price.\u201d\n\n> Prigozhin said he lost 20,000 troops, including about half recruited from prisons, during months of bitter fighting for Bakhmut, in an interview with a Russian journalist in May.

Russia deployed large numbers of troops to Bakhmut after Wagner announced its withdrawal from the city in late May, leaving shortages in occupied areas of southern Ukraine, the officials said.</p>\n\n<p>The insurrection by Wagner founder Yevgeny Prigozhin that spiraled into the biggest threat to President Vladimir Putin\u2019s 24-year rule has deprived Russian forces of some of their most battle-hardened troops in Ukraine. The Defense Ministry in Moscow has given no indication so far of how many mercenaries signed contracts to join the military by a July 1 deadline. Prigozhin accused Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu of attempting to \u201cdestroy\u201d Wagner with the demand.</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine said last week that Wagner forces are unlikely to reappear on the battlefield in any significant numbers. Ukrainian military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov told the Ukrainska Pravda news outlet the group was \u201cthe most efficient Russian unit, which was able to achieve success at any price.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Prigozhin said he lost 20,000 troops, including about half recruited from prisons, during months of bitter fighting for Bakhmut, in an interview with a Russian journalist in May. He claimed to have deployed 50,000 convicts on the battlefield. </p>\n\n<p>While Wagner\u2019s exit isn\u2019t expected to alter the course of the war in Ukraine, Putin\u2019s determination to avoid full military mobilization means Russia is likely to send more Chechens and convicts to the front line in the coming weeks, the European officials said.</p>\n\n<p>Dmitry Medvedev, the former president who\u2019s now deputy head of Russia\u2019s security council, claimed Tuesday the Defense Ministry had recruited 185,000 new contract soldiers so far this year, including almost 10,000 who had signed up in the past week since the mutiny.

Another option under consideration is for Bulgaria to take a minority share in Ukraine's Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant, where the equipment is to be installed.\n\n>The U.S. Embassy in Sofia didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Energoatom declined to comment.\n\n>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in Sofia on Thursday for his first visit to Bulgaria since Russia's invasion. Discussions are to include the potential deal, officials said.\n\n>The Belene plant has become a major flashpoint in Bulgaria, which is divided between those seeking closer integration with the West and those who want to reinforce cultural and economic links to Russia.\n\n>On Thursday, the Bulgarian parliament passed a decision requiring the government to conduct negotiations with Kyiv for the sale.\n\n>The possible deal, which has been in the works for weeks, was kept secret to prevent pro-Russian politicians in Bulgaria from trying to block it, officials said. It was then rushed through the legislature, prompting criticism by two major pro-Moscow opposition parties.\n\n>Europe's energy landscape has changed beyond recognition since Moscow invaded Ukraine last year, with Russia, once the region's biggest energy supplier, now all but squeezed out of the lucrative market. The EU last year slashed its imports of Russian oil, gas and coal.\n\n>Bulgaria itself relied on Russia for most of its gas supplies before the invasion began in February 2022.\n\n>\"The deal shows how Russia's energy influence in Europe is diminishing fast,\" said Martin Vladimirov, director of the energy and climate program at the Center for the Study of Democracy, a Sofia-based think tank. The deal is also \"part of a larger Western strategy to bring the Ukrainian energy market into the European orbit,\" he said.\n\n>For Ukraine, which is working to complete two power-generating units at its Khmelnytskyi nuclear plant in the country's west, the equipment would fill a gap for its Soviet-designed facility and help Kyiv expand its power exports to Europe. Ukraine restarted those exports this spring after Moscow tried and failed to destroy its energy infrastructure with missile and drone attacks.\n\n>Ukrainian nuclear technicians are already trained to use Russian-made equipment.\n\n>\"After the start of the war in Ukraine, building a power plant with that equipment became [politically] impossible\" in Bulgaria, said Delyan Dobrev, a lawmaker from the center-right GERB party, which supports the government. Ukraine \"needs the equipment that we have. It is a perfect match.\"\n\n>Russia has long used its command of the global nuclear supply chain to increase its influence around the world. Russia provides crucial fuel supplies, including around 46% of global uranium-enrichment capacity, according to the World Nuclear Association. The U.S. is one of Russia's biggest customers of enriched uranium.\n\n>In Bulgaria, the deal would mark the end of a nuclear partnership with Moscow that has shaped its energy policy for decades and tied the country closer to the Kremlin.\n\n>Work on the Belene plant has been stopped and restarted several times since the 1980s. Western governments have criticized it as a technically and commercially flawed project that would bind Bulgaria for decades to Russian energy supplies.\n\n>Bulgaria already has another nuclear power plant with Soviet-built reactors in operation.\n\n>Russian President Vladimir Putin has long sought to exploit divisions in Europe's poorer eastern flank, deploying an arsenal of tools -- including propaganda, economic pressure, hacking and political subterfuge -- to wield influence and discredit the West.\n\n>That strategy found fertile ground in Bulgaria, the EU's poorest member in terms of gross domestic product per capita, which has for centuries shared deep historical and economic ties with Russia, including the Orthodox Christian faith and Slavic culture. Moscow denies exerting undue influence.\n\n>\"The Belene project was a key instrument for entrenching and expanding Russian influence in the Bulgarian political and economic elite,\" Vladimirov said.\n\n>After the invasion, Bulgarian arms manufacturers became major exporters of weapons to Ukraine, usually via intermediaries in Slovakia and Poland. Late last year, the Bulgarian Parliament decided to officially send military support to Kyiv.\n\n>A new government, formed last month, has promised to increase this support.\n\n>But divisions remain. The country has been gripped by a political crisis -- it has seen five inconclusive parliamentary elections in around two years -- and support for Ukraine has been one of the fault lines.\n\n>On Thursday, two pro-Russian parties in parliament, the Socialist Party and the nationalist party Revival, voted against the Belene decision.",

By the time Ukraine\u2019s anticipated offensive is over, *Kyiv may also warm up to the idea of a negotiated settlement, having given its best shot on the battlefield and facing growing constraints on both its own manpower and help from abroad.*\n\n-\n\n> *Regardless of Russia\u2019s response, the West would continue to provide the arms Ukraine needs to defend itself over the long term and make sure that any pause in the fighting did not work to Russia\u2019s advantage.* And if Russia rejected a cease-fire (or accepted one and then violated it), its intransigence would deepen its diplomatic isolation, shore up the sanctions regime, and strengthen support for Ukraine in the United States and Europe.\n\n-\n\n> Even if a cease-fire held and a diplomatic process got underway, *NATO countries should continue to arm Ukraine, removing any doubts in Kyiv that its compliance with a diplomatic roadmap would mean the end of military support*. Moreover, the United States could make clear to Kyiv that if Putin violated the cease-fire while Ukraine honored it, Washington would further step up the flow of arms and waive restrictions on Ukraine\u2019s ability to target military positions inside Russia from which attacks are being launched.\n\n-\n\n> *Ukraine would have little choice but to accede to a policy that gave it the economic and military support needed to secure the territory under its control\u2014the vast majority of the country\u2014while taking off the table the liberation by force of those territories still under Russian occupation.* Moreover, the West would continue to use sanctions and diplomatic leverage to restore Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity\u2014but at the negotiating table, not on the battlefield.\n\nThe West simply needs to stop arming Ukraine after this offensive, but then continue to arm it, but only with the weapons neccesary to defend the land it holds today, not the ones needed for a potential offense. The arms supply also needs to continue indefinitely, in case Russia breaks the cease-fire and to reassure Kiyv. Pretty simple: We just give Ukraine the defensive F16s, tanks, SPGs and ammunition it needs, but not the offensive ones.\n\n**Ukraine\u2019s path forward**\n\n> Kyiv would forgo an attempt to retake these territories by force now, a gambit that would surely be costly but is likely to fail, instead *accepting that the recovery of territorial integrity must await a diplomatic breakthrough*. A breakthrough, in turn, may be possible only after Putin is no longer in power.\n\n-\n>But because Putin would surely reject these demands out of hand, a prolonged diplomatic stalemate would then emerge, effectively *producing a new frozen conflict*. Ideally, the cease-fire would hold, leading to a status quo like the one that prevails on the *Korean Peninsula*, which has remained largely stable without a formal peace pact for 70 years. *Cyprus* has similarly been divided but stable for decades. This is not an ideal outcome, but it is preferable to a high-intensity war that continues for years.\n\n-\n> *This security pact, although it would fall short of an ironclad security guarantee, might resemble Israel\u2019s defense relationship with the United States or the relationship that Finland and Sweden enjoyed with NATO before they decided to join the alliance. The pact might also include a provision similar to Article 4 of the NATO treaty, which calls for consultations when any party judges its territorial integrity, political independence, or security to be threatened.\n\n-\n> It is of course conceivable that Putin would reject a cease-fire\u2014or *accept it only for the purpose of rebuilding his military and making a later run at conquering Ukraine. But little would be lost by testing Moscow\u2019s readiness for compromise.*\n\nSo Ukraine\u2019s option for reunification is a diplomatic breakthrough, even though in the examples they themselves cite, this breakthrough never occured and looks unlikely to. But Ukraine gets another vague security agreement, which it'll certainly love, and even if Ukraine gets reinvaded later, what's to lose? Except lives.\n\nRussia's incentives\n\n> Even if the West steps up its military assistance, *Ukraine is poised to fall well short of vanquishing Russian forces.* It is running out of soldiers and ammunition, and its economy continues to deteriorate. Russian troops are dug in, and fresh recruits are heading to the front.\n\n-\n> Putin seems to believe that *time is on his side*, calculating that he can ride out economic sanctions, which have failed to strangle the Russian economy, and maintain popular support for the war, an operation that, according to polls from the Levada Center, more than 70 percent of Russians still back. *Putin doubts the staying power of Ukraine and its Western supporters, expecting that their resolve will wane.* And *he surely calculates that as his new conscripts enter the fight, Russia should be able to expand its territorial gains,* allowing him to declare that he has substantially expanded Russia\u2019s borders when the fighting stops.\n\n-\n>*Provided that Ukraine makes battlefield gains this summer, it is at least plausible that Putin would view a cease-fire and peace plan as a face-saving off-ramp.*\n\n-\n> In the meantime, Western governments could *promise to fully lift sanctions against Russia and normalize relations* with it only if Moscow *signed a peace agreement that was acceptable to Kyiv*.\n\n-\n>Ukraine would have little choice but to accede to a policy that gave it the economic and military support needed to secure the territory under its control\u2014the vast majority of the country\u2014while taking off the table the liberation by force of those territories still under Russian occupation. Moreover, *the West would continue to use sanctions and diplomatic leverage to restore Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity*\u2014but at the negotiating table, not on the battlefield.\n\nSo Putin, who thinks he can sit out the West and strike back with fresh recruits, will want an off-ramp after the coming offensive, despite it being largely unsuccessful. The West will then lift sanctions and normalize relations to get a peace agreement. It will then use those sanctions, despite having just lifted them, to work towards restoring Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity.",

Pretty simple: We just give Ukraine the defensive F16s, tanks, SPGs and ammunition it needs, but not the offensive ones.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ukraine\u2019s path forward</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Kyiv would forgo an attempt to retake these territories by force now, a gambit that would surely be costly but is likely to fail, instead <em>accepting that the recovery of territorial integrity must await a diplomatic breakthrough</em>. A breakthrough, in turn, may be possible only after Putin is no longer in power.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2></h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>But because Putin would surely reject these demands out of hand, a prolonged diplomatic stalemate would then emerge, effectively <em>producing a new frozen conflict</em>. Ideally, the cease-fire would hold, leading to a status quo like the one that prevails on the <em>Korean Peninsula</em>, which has remained largely stable without a formal peace pact for 70 years. <em>Cyprus</em> has similarly been divided but stable for decades. This is not an ideal outcome, but it is preferable to a high-intensity war that continues for years.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2></h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>*This security pact, although it would fall short of an ironclad security guarantee, might resemble Israel\u2019s defense relationship with the United States or the relationship that Finland and Sweden enjoyed with NATO before they decided to join the alliance. The pact might also include a provision similar to Article 4 of the NATO treaty, which calls for consultations when any party judges its territorial integrity, political independence, or security to be threatened.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2></h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is of course conceivable that Putin would reject a cease-fire\u2014or <em>accept it only for the purpose of rebuilding his military and making a later run at conquering Ukraine. But little would be lost by testing Moscow\u2019s readiness for compromise.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So Ukraine\u2019s option for reunification is a diplomatic breakthrough, even though in the examples they themselves cite, this breakthrough never occured and looks unlikely to. But Ukraine gets another vague security agreement, which it&#39;ll certainly love, and even if Ukraine gets reinvaded later, what&#39;s to lose? Except lives.</p>\n\n<p>Russia&#39;s incentives</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Even if the West steps up its military assistance, <em>Ukraine is poised to fall well short of vanquishing Russian forces.</em> It is running out of soldiers and ammunition, and its economy continues to deteriorate. Russian troops are dug in, and fresh recruits are heading to the front.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2></h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Putin seems to believe that <em>time is on his side</em>, calculating that he can ride out economic sanctions, which have failed to strangle the Russian economy, and maintain popular support for the war, an operation that, according to polls from the Levada Center, more than 70 percent of Russians still back. <em>Putin doubts the staying power of Ukraine and its Western supporters, expecting that their resolve will wane.</em> And <em>he surely calculates that as his new conscripts enter the fight, Russia should be able to expand its territorial gains,</em> allowing him to declare that he has substantially expanded Russia\u2019s borders when the fighting stops.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2></h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Provided that Ukraine makes battlefield gains this summer, it is at least plausible that Putin would view a cease-fire and peace plan as a face-saving off-ramp.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2></h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the meantime, Western governments could <em>promise to fully lift sanctions against Russia and normalize relations</em> with it only if Moscow <em>signed a peace agreement that was acceptable to Kyiv</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2></h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ukraine would have little choice but to accede to a policy that gave it the economic and military support needed to secure the territory under its control\u2014the vast majority of the country\u2014while taking off the table the liberation by force of those territories still under Russian occupation. Moreover, <em>the West would continue to use sanctions and diplomatic leverage to restore Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity</em>\u2014but at the negotiating table, not on the battlefield.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So Putin, who thinks he can sit out the West and strike back with fresh recruits, will want an off-ramp after the coming offensive, despite it being largely unsuccessful. The West will then lift sanctions and normalize relations to get a peace agreement. It will then use those sanctions, despite having just lifted them, to work towards restoring Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity.</p>\n</div>",

This isn\u2019t popular to say round these parts, but the US was never interested in the Ukrainian war effort to the length that they want to have Ukraine winning a decisive victory. You can think otherwise, I invite to ponder over the thousands of tanks, planes and missiles that the US could easily send to defeat one of their 2 great geopolitical rivals. And if you can\u2019t understand why gambling on the outcome of a dissolution of the state sitting on the biggest nuclear arsenal on the planet is not the optimal course of action, I again invite you to ponder if it would be better to have proper far right revanchists take power in Russia after Russia takes a humiliation and isn\u2019t completely destroyed. This has to end in a settlement and not with Ukraine taking Moscow. EU leaders said this a year ago and were booed because western audiences like a bit of blood or it\u2019s not entertaining enough.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><ol>\n<li><p>Lavrov is absolutely in Putin\u2019s inner circle and if you want to express otherwise I\u2019m dying to see some source on that.</p></li>\n<li><p>This isn\u2019t popular to say round these parts, but the US was never interested in the Ukrainian war effort to the length that they want to have Ukraine winning a decisive victory. You can think otherwise, I invite to ponder over the thousands of tanks, planes and missiles that the US could easily send to defeat one of their 2 great geopolitical rivals. And if you can\u2019t understand why gambling on the outcome of a dissolution of the state sitting on the biggest nuclear arsenal on the planet is not the optimal course of action, I again invite you to ponder if it would be better to have proper far right revanchists take power in Russia after Russia takes a humiliation and isn\u2019t completely destroyed. This has to end in a settlement and not with Ukraine taking Moscow. EU leaders said this a year ago and were booed because western audiences like a bit of blood or it\u2019s not entertaining enough. Now the US obviously have attempts ongoing to see this affair to an end that is favorable to them. And apparently people find it surprising that US interest is not the same as Ukrainian interests.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>As a European transnationalist, I wish the continent could learn this lesson eventually, after it has been hammered home again and again and again.</p>\n</div>",

Moreover the bomblets dropped from a cluster munition are not especially powerful. So youre right to ask about efficiency. My guess would be against an antipersonnel mine, especially those  butterfly mines, would be fairly easy to set off with some kind of preliminary bombardment but an emplaced and dug in AT mine would require a pretty near miss. Just as important though are A) the dud rate (you dont want to *re*mine the area, this is an issue with older DPICMs) and B) the ease of replacement for Russia. If were talking about clearing a bunch of scatterable AP mines, the bitch is that it is also even easier to just remine the area.

He also used the talking points of nazis in Ukraine, alleged attacks on civilians in Donbass, NATO threat etc. to justify the war. Would Prigozhin try to paint it as if Putin was lied to so he acted on wrong information? Imho that does not add up, since it would make Putin look incredibly naive.</p>\n</div>",

            "body": "There were massive shipbuilding facilities on the west coast during WWII, but by and large these died away as Congress refocused on the East Coast. A big reason was the overall collapse in US shipbuilding after WWII, combined with the increasingly specialized construction techniques and equipment ships needed. All this parallels developments in the Army and Air Force which at nearly the same time, and for nearly the same reason, moved form 'off the shelf' solutions to very specialized equipment. You cant build a nuclear submarine at just any old shipyard, and for costs reasons its better to build a critical mass of expertise than spread it out. A single large shipyard at Groten, CT or Norfolk, VA is going to be cheaper and more efficient than a bunch of little shipyards scattered across the country. You concentrate experts, you concentrate knowledge, and concentrate resources. Keep in mind too there are a lot of specialized machines that go into building these ships, the crane which lays the keel for US CVNs was for many years the largest in the world. Though I think Chinas got a bigger one now. Its not really feasible to keep two or three 'largest cranes in the world' around, you know? \n\nJust as important is that, since WWII, the USN has *not* emphasized sergable ship construction. They have the same problems that the USAF and USAr do regarding specialty equipment (again you cant just go to Walmart and order two dozen nuclear pressure containment vessels). But the USN's problem is that ships are 1) expensive, 2) slow to build, 3) highly technical and 4) fucking expensive. Shipbuilding is something, IMO, that *cannot* be serged to meet a wartime need. Look at World War Two, the ships that won WWII for the allies were all either in the water or on order, many of them even laid out and under construction, *before* the war began. The 1939 and 1940 shipbuilding programs, which were (for the US) *peacetime* projects won WWII. The Iowas were all ordered in 1939 and 1940, and were commissioned in 1942. The first batch of Essex carriers, that is the famous ones, were ordered in 1940 and in the water by 1943. The first twenty Fletchers were ordered in 1941, laid out in March nine months *before* Pearl. By the end of 1942 the USN was larger than the IJN in every key category, and that was all pre-war ship orders. The lesson is obvious, if it couldn't happen during full mobilization for WWII it wasn't going to happen in the Cold War with the threat of nuclear annihilation hanging over wartime production. And it wont happen with China, given the very likely short, sharp nature of a possible naval war. The time to be building new warships, in particular CVNs and SSNs, is *now*.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>There were massive shipbuilding facilities on the west coast during WWII, but by and large these died away as Congress refocused on the East Coast. A big reason was the overall collapse in US shipbuilding after WWII, combined with the increasingly specialized construction techniques and equipment ships needed. All this parallels developments in the Army and Air Force which at nearly the same time, and for nearly the same reason, moved form &#39;off the shelf&#39; solutions to very specialized equipment. You cant build a nuclear submarine at just any old shipyard, and for costs reasons its better to build a critical mass of expertise than spread it out. A single large shipyard at Groten, CT or Norfolk, VA is going to be cheaper and more efficient than a bunch of little shipyards scattered across the country. You concentrate experts, you concentrate knowledge, and concentrate resources. Keep in mind too there are a lot of specialized machines that go into building these ships, the crane which lays the keel for US CVNs was for many years the largest in the world. Though I think Chinas got a bigger one now. Its not really feasible to keep two or three &#39;largest cranes in the world&#39; around, you know? </p>\n\n<p>Just as important is that, since WWII, the USN has <em>not</em> emphasized sergable ship construction. They have the same problems that the USAF and USAr do regarding specialty equipment (again you cant just go to Walmart and order two dozen nuclear pressure containment vessels). But the USN&#39;s problem is that ships are 1) expensive, 2) slow to build, 3) highly technical and 4) fucking expensive. Shipbuilding is something, IMO, that <em>cannot</em> be serged to meet a wartime need. Look at World War Two, the ships that won WWII for the allies were all either in the water or on order, many of them even laid out and under construction, <em>before</em> the war began. The 1939 and 1940 shipbuilding programs, which were (for the US) <em>peacetime</em> projects won WWII. The Iowas were all ordered in 1939 and 1940, and were commissioned in 1942. The first batch of Essex carriers, that is the famous ones, were ordered in 1940 and in the water by 1943. The first twenty Fletchers were ordered in 1941, laid out in March nine months <em>before</em> Pearl. By the end of 1942 the USN was larger than the IJN in every key category, and that was all pre-war ship orders. The lesson is obvious, if it couldn&#39;t happen during full mobilization for WWII it wasn&#39;t going to happen in the Cold War with the threat of nuclear annihilation hanging over wartime production. And it wont happen with China, given the very likely short, sharp nature of a possible naval war. The time to be building new warships, in particular CVNs and SSNs, is <em>now</em>. Not in five years once a shipyard expansion project has finished when either the crisis is on us or has passed all together. Instead the Navy is pursuing options that can help it not, like tapping into the existing production capacity in allied nations like SK, JPN, and AUS. The docks at Busan are <em>huge</em> and with the proper planning could be used <em>now</em> to build stuff like Burkes and whatever Frigate the Navy decides it wants (and boy wouldn&#39;t Samsung or Hyundai love to sell them on the SKNs existing FF designs).</p>\n</div>",

I decided to refresh myself on how much of a humanitarian he was and the first think that caught by eye on Wikipedia was the EU condemning the way he used rape as a political tool. Most seriously to me if that he did not have the support of his own people, as demonstrated by the way that his regime collapsed with minimal resistance, and it took quite some time for opposition networks to spring up.\n\nSo based on the above, I'm not very unhappy we invaded Iraq. I think on the whole the US and the world are worse for us having invaded given the resulting US loss of credibility that I think contributed to, among other things, emboldening Putin to do things like invading Ukraine, and the justifications for the invasion were complete BS, but I think that Iraq is better now than it was under Hussein and I think that's a good thing. If the people of Iraq had rallied behind Hussein because it turned out this was really a government they supported then I'd think it was much more of an unjust war, but I'm never going to be that upset about replacing a dictator with a democracy.\n\nAs a result, though I have misgivings about the war for the reasons I discussed above, I would still align my sympathies with the US, and I wouldn't want the US to lose the war, which is what being \"ok\" with any sort of weapon being used against US soldiers means to me, that I would actively want them to die and the US to be defeated as a result. I'm not sure what it would take for my sympathies to align against the US, given I live here, but it would probably be something like Biden announcing tomorrow that he had decided to annex Mexico and the army marching south.\n\nNow that said, how upset would I be with the Iraqi army if some of them decided to use chemical weapons against US troops? Not very. The casualty rates in both wars against Iraq were incredibly lopsided in favor of Americans, and I'm not sure how angry I'm supposed to be at someone pushed into an impossible situation who tries to find a way to even the odds a bit.

Might come in handy...\n\nSpirit of the Desert: \u2026Since the Ukrainians show amazing insensitivity to human losses, I consider today's change in tactics of the Ukrainian command as a justified approach in finding the \"key\" to the Russian defense. Classical attacks according to our combat manuals involve the preliminary suppression and destruction of the enemy's defensive positions by artillery and aircraft, as well as the simultaneous destruction of his combat command and control organs to the depth of the defense zone and the prevention of the approaches of his reserves. Since the Ukrainians have practically no aviation and they are significantly inferior to the Russians in the amount of artillery, classical attacks lead to nothing but the mass loss of expensive military equipment on the way to Russian positions, disorganization and demoralization of the attackers, followed by a retreat. Almost three weeks of such attacks failed to break through the Russian security strip, in addition, as G-3 from USAREUR-AF in Stuttgart told me, up to a quarter of our Bradleys were already lost, and they are now forced to urgently send two company \"Bradley\" and many other equipment to replenish and restore the combat readiness of two brigades of the strike force of Ukrainians.\nUnder these conditions, our guys, together with the Ukrainian commanders, developed the tactics of \"mosquito\" advance - continuous attacks on Russian positions by small tactical groups of Ukrainian infantry. The Russians, who are much more sensitive to losses in manpower, try to avoid close (\u201ccontact\u201d) battles and, when the Ukrainians reach their trenches, they retreat, leaving the artillery to destroy the enemy. This usually succeeds - Ukrainians die or retreat. But this tactic has a positive effect. Several of these attacks almost completely destroy the Russian position, moreover, most often with their own fire, after which the Russians are forced to retreat to a new line, where this tactic is repeated. That is how, in two weeks, the Russians were pushed three miles away from the strategically important position of Makarovka. And this tactic is improving all the time. Ours believe that, with the continued pace of such advancement, in two weeks the Ukrainians will be able to overcome the Russian security zone and begin to storm their main line of defense, while maintaining the offensive potential of their strongest brigades. Perhaps this is what our Milli meant when he said yesterday about the ten weeks of the Ukrainian offensive.\nThis tactic has another important effect. To repel such \"mosquito\" attacks, the Russians are forced to spend more artillery shells, the stocks of which they replenish more slowly than they use up. And in two weeks of such battles, they may well approach the depletion of their reserves. Of course, this leads to heavy losses of the Ukrainians, but, as I said at the beginning, they are not very sensitive to the death of their soldiers. In addition, although small, but the advance is the best excuse for their death than unsuccessful attacks. And here, it must be admitted that the Russians today are much closer to the armies of Western countries than the Ukrainians - they take care of their soldiers ...",

It is by far and away the part of this conflict that I focus on the most and has been essentially since the start of the war.   \n\n\nAt this point, it does not appear that any Western weapons shipment is going to make Putin reach for tactical nukes. The red lines simply have not been set clearly. Is there still a risk that they could be the deciding factor? Theoretically, yes. Because Russian messaging as to what exactly constitutes a red line for nuclear use is so vague, weapons shipments could potentially be tipping that threshold. That said, using tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine in response to Western weapons shipments, even of something like F-16s, would be an escalation of massive proportions unequal to what any weapons shipment could provide. It is also unlikely to stop said shipments unless Russia is willing to deploy a significant amount of nuclear weapons in Western Ukraine specifically on civilian targets that serve as logistic hubs. Any use of nuclear weapons is clearly anathema to the entire international community. China has said as much explicitly. Therefore, the downsides of using nuclear weapons are massive. Would F-16s be enough to tip the calculation in favor of taking that massive hit, quite possibly sparking further violence you are not capable of dealing with if NATO launches a kinetic demonstration in response to your actions? The answer is probably not, at least to a rational actor.  \n\n\nOf course, is Putin a rational actor? All signs point to yes. His rhetoric is certainly bombastic and his personal behavior seems somewhat unhinged at times (his paranoia, his sudden public appearances, etc), but nothing Putin has actually done since the start of this conflict has indicated that he is massively irrational. In context, his nuclear threats are an entirely rational move, if irresponsible. Similarly, his handling of the Prigozhin situation demonstrates a rational actor willing to negotiate when faced with existential threats, not a madman bent on death before dishonor. Putin himself seems very dedicated to the idea of not saying he endorses nuclear usage. The fact that \"sources in the Kremlin\" have come out and said nuclear use was gamed out at Putin's request, which led to Putin deeming it unacceptable, is clearly messaging meant to show his restraint/rationality. Of course, we cannot predict Putin's individual behavior. Even if he is rational, I doubt that he is particularly mentally well, but I am not a psychiatrist. At this point, other world leaders (who do indeed have psychiatrists that look at people like Putin in great detail and determine whether he is rational based on the available evidence) seem to treat him normally, so I will assume they are correct.   \n\n\nThe question then becomes, what will push that red line of nuclear use for rational actor Putin? The short answer is, as I alluded to above, we really don't know. But a reasonable estimation of a \"red line\" would be Crimea. That is most often the \"red line\" nuclear experts refer when talking about theoretical thresholds for Russian nuclear use. That's not to say there's consensus as to whether he would use a nuke in a scenario in which Crimea is threatened, it's just that that is the most commonly agreed upon line. The other \"red line\" is the only one Putin has fully articulated: his own interpretation of Russian nuclear doctrine, in which he claims that Russia will use nukes when the existence of the state is threatened. A vague set of terms, clearly calculated to both give the impression of a red line but keep it unclear enough to keep it scary. In my mind, this likely means direct NATO intervention in the conflict. It may also mean something akin to a full-scale Ukrainian invasion of Russia (very unlikely). But I think the former is what Putin is alluding to with these statements. NATO boots on the ground in Ukraine = direct threat to the existence of Russia. However, there is no place for weapons shipments in these red lines. No one weapons system is going to threaten the existence of the Russian state. No one weapons system is going to force Crimea to capitulate.   \n\n\nDoes that all mean the West can send whatever they want whenever they want? Well, no. As I mentioned at the top, it's important to remember that just because we think Putin is rational and we think he doesn't care enough to reach for nukes over weapons shipments, it doesn't mean he actually fits those assessments. Therefore, a cautious approach is required. If it comes to a point where it's obvious that weapons shipments are actually shifting the needle towards Russia nuclear usage, then course corrections can be made in a way that's not possible if everything is being dumped at once.",

Much like previous wonder weapons sent Ukraine's way, their impact will undoubtedly be positive but it won't end the war overnight. I don't see any convincing evidence that cluster munitions would pose enough of a threat to effectively break the will of the majority of Russia military units deployed in Ukraine. Even in the event of a rout (which also seems unlikely in the main, given just how big the front is and the fact that the Russian forces for the most part seem entrenched and not prone to panicking akin to last year's successful counteroffensive), I'm not sure that would necessitate the use of nuclear weapons by Russia or that using nuclear weapons in that scenario would actually be domestically popular or salvage the situation. As it stands, nuclear weapon usage is wildly unpopular among Russians as a whole and unpopular even among the hawks. A very vocal minority support it, as Karaganov and Trenin some what outlandishly demonstrated, but even those two faced significant and widespread pushback for their opinion pieces, far more criticism than support I would say.",

I agree that there was more criticism than support of Karaganov and Trenin, but the fact that there is an open debate - if one doesn't assume that it is all pure signalling, which I think is extremely unlikely - may hint to there also being a pro-nuke fraction behind closed doors, and we can't know who has Putin's ear and how paranoid he would be of Ukraine marching to Moscow. That being said, I agree with your conclusion that these are pretty unlikely events, but they should be accounted for in the decision-making process.",

Simply put, I don't think even Putin really knew where his red lines were at the time the war started, he just wanted to use the stick as a coercive tool and had not thought through the full implications of people balking at the threats.
