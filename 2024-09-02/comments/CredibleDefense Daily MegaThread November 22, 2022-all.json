        "body": ">**EU Set to Soften Russian Oil Price Cap Plan Before Approval**\n\n> The European Union watered down its latest sanctions proposal for a price cap on Russia\u2019s oil exports by delaying its full implementation and softening key shipping provisions.\nThe bloc proposed adding a 45-day transition to the introduction of the cap, according to a document seen by Bloomberg. The proposed grace period would apply to oil loaded before Dec. 5 -- the date oil sanctions are due to kick in -- and unloaded by Jan. 19, aligning the EU to a clause previously announced by the US and the UK.\n\n>EU ambassadors are scheduled to meet on Wednesday with the aim of approving the cap, Bloomberg previously reported. The diplomats are expected to also discuss the price level at the meeting. If they back the proposal, the EU and the Group of Seven could announce the cap as early as that evening.\n\n>The cap would ban companies from providing shipping and services, such as insurance, brokering and financial assistance, needed to transport Russian oil anywhere in the world unless the oil is sold below the agreed threshold.\n\n>The US has pushed its allies in Europe to tweak a package of oil sanctions, which included an outright ban on services, that the bloc originally adopted in June by adding the price cap with two aims: to keep Russian oil on the market to avoid price spikes, while at the same time limiting Moscow\u2019s revenues.\n\n>The cap will be set using historical price data for Russian oil and the current state of the market, according to a senior US Treasury official.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><strong>EU Set to Soften Russian Oil Price Cap Plan Before Approval</strong></p>\n\n<p>The European Union watered down its latest sanctions proposal for a price cap on Russia\u2019s oil exports by delaying its full implementation and softening key shipping provisions.\nThe bloc proposed adding a 45-day transition to the introduction of the cap, according to a document seen by Bloomberg. The proposed grace period would apply to oil loaded before Dec. 5 -- the date oil sanctions are due to kick in -- and unloaded by Jan. 19, aligning the EU to a clause previously announced by the US and the UK.</p>\n\n<p>EU ambassadors are scheduled to meet on Wednesday with the aim of approving the cap, Bloomberg previously reported. The diplomats are expected to also discuss the price level at the meeting. If they back the proposal, the EU and the Group of Seven could announce the cap as early as that evening.</p>\n\n<p>The cap would ban companies from providing shipping and services, such as insurance, brokering and financial assistance, needed to transport Russian oil anywhere in the world unless the oil is sold below the agreed threshold.</p>\n\n<p>The US has pushed its allies in Europe to tweak a package of oil sanctions, which included an outright ban on services, that the bloc originally adopted in June by adding the price cap with two aims: to keep Russian oil on the market to avoid price spikes, while at the same time limiting Moscow\u2019s revenues.</p>\n\n<p>The cap will be set using historical price data for Russian oil and the current state of the market, according to a senior US Treasury official. The official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity Wednesday, said the price could be revisited as frequently as every few months but is expected to remain above the price of production.</p>\n\n<p>Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, which oversees US sanctions policy, issued updated industry guidance Tuesday before the EU decision.

To be clear you particularly saying it isn't what terrifies me, what terrifies me is that there are likely people in NATO governments who are gonna come out of this war saying \"yeah we should have been less tough on Russia\".\n\nAnd yes, I think it's safe to say that's what happened.  We didn't ignore the issue (we physically can't, that's not how it works), but considering Russia up and just annexed part of another nation and ignited a proxy republic in another part, Europe's and America's responses were absolutely mild.  We sanctioned Russia (however, it's now coming to light European defense companies might have not followed the sanctions), but other than that the western powers under the leadership of Obama (I remind you that Obama went into power on a very dovish platform vs Russia compared to Republicans, despite the Georgian thing in 2008), Merkel, and similar parties absolutely treated the whole thing as a fait accompli.  \n\nPartially because the assumption was \"well Russia cares about Ukraine more than we do, it'd be escalatory for us to do much\".  It's why we helped arrange Minsk 1 and 2, it's why we continued tying ourselves economically to Russia, because we fundamentally valued \"normalcy\" more than a real solution.  This is the \"managing as opposed to winning\" that the article advocates, and maybe for some issues it works, but it's completely missed the mark here.\n\nHeck, we wouldn't even give Ukraine stingers, those things we gave the Mujahadeen, until we were sure invasion was inevitable.  I really, truly don't understand how there are still serious geopolitical voices in the west who think we weren't trying to be de-escalatory in the Ukraine question.  But I understand that they do exist, and again, that terrifies me.  Because if they continue to hold as much sway in Europe as they did before, the carnage of this war is only the beginning.  \n\nI've actually talked to you about this before, so I'll leave the link here and move onto the other point (which is actually very interesting):\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/wk1h88/credibledefense_daily_megathread_august_09_2022/ijnjmom/\n\n>Failure for whom, exactly? America is coming out of this particular war rather well. The greatest threat to European security is being demilitarized, economically isolated, and diplomatically annihilated all without the loss of a single American soldier. For Ukraine the butchers bill is high, but let us not pretend American foreign policy exists for the benefit of Ukraine.\n\nHm, now that's an interesting argument.  \n\nI think it's beyond clear that of the outcomes for America post Feb 22, what's happening now is close to the best case scenario, and probably far better than what we could realistically hope for.  \n\nHowever, you're taking it further, suggesting that America's actually **better off** now than they would be if Putin didn't pull the trigger, or performed a more local Donbas-only operation.\n\nI'll be honest, I think I disagree.  I think 6 digits of people dying in a war in Europe is absolutely a failure for NATO/EU.  Few of those people are NATO citizens, but even morality aside, wars are fundamentally destabilizing, particularly proximal or particularly brutal wars even more so, and this one is both.\n\nThere's a new refugee crisis, the war is exacerbating the already brewing recession (especially in Europe), and the conflict is forcing our attention away from the rivalry we were actually preparing for.\n\nSure, we've gotten some benefits.  NATO is politically revitalized, US foreign credibility is somewhat restored from the Afghanistan debacle, a vocal and self-declared enemy of the west is thoroughly humiliated, and yes, a lot of Russian soldiers and tanks are destroyed.  But I'd qualify all that as \"consolation prizes\".  I still think we'd be better off if this war just didn't happen.\n\nBut it's an interesting thought.  I might be biased by the fact that this is too close to home and I can't close my eyes to the humanitarian cost.",

But I understand that they do exist, and again, that terrifies me.  Because if they continue to hold as much sway in Europe as they did before, the carnage of this war is only the beginning.  </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve actually talked to you about this before, so I&#39;ll leave the link here and move onto the other point (which is actually very interesting):</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/wk1h88/credibledefense_daily_megathread_august_09_2022/ijnjmom/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/wk1h88/credibledefense_daily_megathread_august_09_2022/ijnjmom/</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Failure for whom, exactly? America is coming out of this particular war rather well. The greatest threat to European security is being demilitarized, economically isolated, and diplomatically annihilated all without the loss of a single American soldier. For Ukraine the butchers bill is high, but let us not pretend American foreign policy exists for the benefit of Ukraine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hm, now that&#39;s an interesting argument.  </p>\n\n<p>I think it&#39;s beyond clear that of the outcomes for America post Feb 22, what&#39;s happening now is close to the best case scenario, and probably far better than what we could realistically hope for.  </p>\n\n<p>However, you&#39;re taking it further, suggesting that America&#39;s actually <strong>better off</strong> now than they would be if Putin didn&#39;t pull the trigger, or performed a more local Donbas-only operation.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll be honest, I think I disagree.  I think 6 digits of people dying in a war in Europe is absolutely a failure for NATO/EU.  Few of those people are NATO citizens, but even morality aside, wars are fundamentally destabilizing, particularly proximal or particularly brutal wars even more so, and this one is both.</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s a new refugee crisis, the war is exacerbating the already brewing recession (especially in Europe), and the conflict is forcing our attention away from the rivalry we were actually preparing for.</p>\n\n<p>Sure, we&#39;ve gotten some benefits.  NATO is politically revitalized, US foreign credibility is somewhat restored from the Afghanistan debacle, a vocal and self-declared enemy of the west is thoroughly humiliated, and yes, a lot of Russian soldiers and tanks are destroyed.  But I&#39;d qualify all that as &quot;consolation prizes&quot;.  I still think we&#39;d be better off if this war just didn&#39;t happen.</p>\n\n<p>But it&#39;s an interesting thought.  I might be biased by the fact that this is too close to home and I can&#39;t close my eyes to the humanitarian cost.</p>\n</div>",

In 2014 the Ukrainian Army was a *mess* to put it mildly. In fact, one of the major critiques of Putin internally was that in 2014 he didn't go all the way to Kyiv, and instead opted for a negotiated settlement. Add to that a host of other foreign policy preoccupations (Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, to name a few) and domestic concerns, and one wonders where the room was to take on Putin.\n\nFurthermore, what evidence do we have that escalation would have resolved the issue, let alone be politically feasible? We are unwilling to extend a security umbrella over Ukraine *even now,* and there's *still doubts* as to whether they will ever join NATO. Fundamentally Putin knows we will not confront Russia directly over Ukraine out of fears of sparking WW3. Unless that reality changes, there's some hard upper limits on our capacity to escalate. \n\n> It's why we helped arrange Minsk 1 and 2, it's why we continued tying ourselves economically to Russia, because we fundamentally valued \"normalcy\" more than a real solution. This is the \"managing as opposed to winning\" that the article advocates, and maybe for some issues it works, but it's completely missed the mark here.\n\nYes, none of this is a surprise. Biden entered office seeking [predictability](https://www.npr.org/2021/05/21/999196021/biden-wants-a-stable-predictable-relationship-with-russia-thats-complicated) with Russia to focus on China and other domestic concerns - in effect relegating Europe to a secondary theatre. The price of predictability; however, was high and one that Washington now is unwilling to pay. \n\nWhat I think you're ignoring is that over 2020-2021 domestic Ukrainian politics to a turn for the hardline, and Washington offered no compromise to Russia on several key security grievances. Zelensky (who campaigned on a peaceful platform) arrested Medvechuk, passed a discriminatory language law, and shut down Russian media stations, all while pursuing a westward orientation. Meanwhile, the US and EU backed Zelensky with the US affirming they will not change NATOs open door policy (even if they have no intention of admitting Ukraine), will not constrain military cooperation with non-member states, and (perhaps most importantly) will not compel Ukraine to accept some form of neutrality. \n\nIn my view, the big policy failure here was to dangle the prospect of NATO in front of Ukraine, while failing to provide a firm answer on whether or not they would *actually be admitted* until it was too late. \n\n> I really, truly don't understand how there are still serious geopolitical voices in the west who think we weren't trying to be de-escalatory in the Ukraine question.\n\nWar is politics, or so they say. Ultimately we aimed for the best of both worlds - trying to affirm the sovereignty and agency of Ukraine, while being unwilling to broadly welcome Ukraine into our security umbrella; offering the prospect of NATO, while having no intention to fulfill it. This is, frankly, the worst of both worlds: neither de-escalatory, nor escalatory. De-escalation would look like a political settlement between Ukraine, Russia, and the USA (likely favouring Russia), while escalation would be an increased provision of security assistance to Ukraine. Unfortunately we did... neither, and instead opted for the middle route of affirming the unsustainable political status quo, while also offering *no way out* for Russia. \n\n>Because if they continue to hold as much sway in Europe as they did before, the carnage of this war is only the beginning.\n\nUnlike Ukraine, Russia is boxed in by NATO, and all signals from the Kremlin indicate they have no desire to go to war with NATO. \n\nIronically, Mearscheimer wrote a lot about this in the 80s with regards to deterrence theory and political causes for war (back when he was actually credible). Wars occur when problems outgrow the political systems that produce and manage them, and thus one party believes that through the application of violence they can force a settlement. In this particular case, Russia was unwilling to allow Ukraine to exit its orbit and become a platform for American power projection along Russia's border, and the United States was unwilling to renegotiate the security framework of Europe to allow Russia to have a say in where NATOs borders end. Ukraine no longer desires to be a Russian proxy state (and who can blame them?) and chose a west aligned path. \n\nThere's only a few ways out of this particular crisis if you want to avert war: either extend the security umbrella over Ukraine fully, or back down. Earlier escalation likely leads to an attack *sooner* rather than deterrence (again, the political fundamentals haven't changed, and if your adversary is growing stronger relatively, better to attack now). Deescalation was politically untenable to both NATO and Putin, so I'm surprised you think that upholding the 2014-2021 status quo while Ukraine moves further west is \"deescalation.\" Typically such a phrase involves concessions..\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I still think we'd be better off if this war just didn't happen.\n\nNo war is better than war, except... for when it isn't. Broadly speaking war is horrible, particularly long wars of attrition which is why states try not to engage deliberately in them (Mearscheimer again!). Brief wars of limited destruction that achieve maximalist political aims are the dreams of every conquerer.\n\nHowever, it's the conditions with which we achieve \"no war\" that determine whether or not it's better than conflict. Would we say that simply allowing Putin to achieve a quick regime change in Ukraine and reverting the nation back to its traditional \"vassal of Russia\" status would be better than war? Ukraine doesn't seem to think so - in fact, that seems a cause worth dying for. \n\nSimilarly, would we say that we were willing to give up NATO expansion and forego the open door policy and allow *Russia* to have a say in where NATO goes? That's totally untenable for any superpower.\n\nThose are pretty much your only deescalation avenues. \n\nOn the escalation front, as I've said before: **we are not willing to extend the NATO security umbrella over Ukraine.** We *may* after the war is finished, but that was *never on the table prior to February.* \n\nAs a result, our escalation options to war are limited in the form of economic sanctions (which failed in their deterrent capacity pre Feb), and additional security aid. It's not clear to me that arming Ukraine to the teeth would have done anything but accelerate the Russian timetable because it does not change the fundamental political stalemate, nor does it remove the conditions that started the war.",

Russia also left the grain deal, which is understandable if Ukraine somehow used the deal to attack Russian ships. I'm going off of memory so how the tugs could've been related to the grain deal is fuzzy since it's not on the grain export route. Also errors are likely mine and not his.
