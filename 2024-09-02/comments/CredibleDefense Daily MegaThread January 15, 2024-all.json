                    "body": "I agree with your take, but there's an underlying assumption of \"it makes sense that\" type of thinking when approaching subjects like this.\n\nWe could have also rationalized Russia in the autumn of 2021; they *shouldn't* invade Ukraine because Russia's integration into the European economy is too important to risk, the Kremlin was showing signs of disengaging with internal American politics, the COVID recovery had yet to kick in fully, Russia was on the cusp of becoming a fully developed economy and citizens were quite happy with the status quo, Putin would risk being overthrown, and outside of oil Russia's economy isn't particularly strong and anything else can be bought from China/India/Mexico.\n\nYet Russia's calculus was that a \"quick and easy\" invasion of Ukraine would bring in more benefits than problems, and that Russia had enough hard/soft power to wage the war. Obviously the assumptions have proven to play out differently on the ground. Russia's calculus wasn't entirely crazy either; the Kremlin has placated the population and kept the economy afloat albeit very fragile.\n\nThe idea of \"national self-suicide\" is something we are arguably seeing in Gaza. Hamas probably knew that Israel's response would be on an apocalyptic level, and there are concerns for the future of the Palestinean people in Gaza. However, I won't compare DPRK to Hamas directly because their situations are so vastly different.\n\nBottom line, we don't really know what's going on in Pyongyang, and how they approached their next course of action. Pyongyang may be hedging their bets with the Kremlin and Tiananmen because most South Koreans are either apathetic or even hostile to re-unification since the compromises are unattainable for it to be viable. The aggressive language is about as normal as an NFL broadcast inexplicably fawning over Taylor Swift in the stands; expected but vaguely off-putting. As pointed out though, North Korea is diplomatically weaker due to its nonexistent economy crumbling under COVID. It could also be a purely internal move, with the NK government asserting its legitimacy to the people as the \"real\" Korea compared to the \"treacherous, impure\" South and to shore up its diplomatic realignment.",
                    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I agree with your take, but there&#39;s an underlying assumption of &quot;it makes sense that&quot; type of thinking when approaching subjects like this.</p>\n\n<p>We could have also rationalized Russia in the autumn of 2021; they <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> invade Ukraine because Russia&#39;s integration into the European economy is too important to risk, the Kremlin was showing signs of disengaging with internal American politics, the COVID recovery had yet to kick in fully, Russia was on the cusp of becoming a fully developed economy and citizens were quite happy with the status quo, Putin would risk being overthrown, and outside of oil Russia&#39;s economy isn&#39;t particularly strong and anything else can be bought from China/India/Mexico.</p>\n\n<p>Yet Russia&#39;s calculus was that a &quot;quick and easy&quot; invasion of Ukraine would bring in more benefits than problems, and that Russia had enough hard/soft power to wage the war. Obviously the assumptions have proven to play out differently on the ground. Russia&#39;s calculus wasn&#39;t entirely crazy either; the Kremlin has placated the population and kept the economy afloat albeit very fragile.</p>\n\n<p>The idea of &quot;national self-suicide&quot; is something we are arguably seeing in Gaza. Hamas probably knew that Israel&#39;s response would be on an apocalyptic level, and there are concerns for the future of the Palestinean people in Gaza. However, I won&#39;t compare DPRK to Hamas directly because their situations are so vastly different.</p>\n\n<p>Bottom line, we don&#39;t really know what&#39;s going on in Pyongyang, and how they approached their next course of action. Pyongyang may be hedging their bets with the Kremlin and Tiananmen because most South Koreans are either apathetic or even hostile to re-unification since the compromises are unattainable for it to be viable. The aggressive language is about as normal as an NFL broadcast inexplicably fawning over Taylor Swift in the stands; expected but vaguely off-putting.

It could also be a purely internal move, with the NK government asserting its legitimacy to the people as the &quot;real&quot; Korea compared to the &quot;treacherous, impure&quot; South and to shore up its diplomatic realignment.</p>\n</div>",

The only other scenario outside of the 3 I have outlined so far would be a China that feels like its longterm position relative to the west is declining (and thus feels pressured into a conflict) while also believing itself to be incapable of forcing reunification with Taiwan due to the inherent difficulties of an amphibious operation (again assuming they are convinced of US resolve to defend Taiwan militarily).",

It was a ballistic missile, so maybe damage is limited if it hits somewhere on deck instead of in the side? Or does a freighter's sheer size grant it greater resistance?

Ukrainian armoured formations are beginning to meet Russian forces in battle, and they are going to pulverise Russia\u2019s defensive lines  </p>\n\n<p>...  </p>\n\n<p>With Ukrainian canniness, Western intelligence and equipment and a smattering of good fortune, I expect what\u2019s left of the Russian army to be nothing more than a speed bump on the way to liberating Crimea, pushing to the Russian border and chucking Putin\u2019s war criminals out of Ukraine once and for all.  </p>\n\n<p>Much like Adolf Hitler at the end of his war, Putin appears to be holed up in his bunker, being fed lies, making the wrong decisions while the sharks circle. What\u2019s unfolding in Ukraine now could go down in history as one of the great tank actions, alongside Cambrai, Kursk and the Arras counterattack. It will certainly go down as the end of Moscow\u2019s illegal invasion \u2013 and perhaps the beginning of the end of Putin</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

The latest episode is an excellent discussion with topic expert Gregory D Johnson about the Houthi anti-shipping campaign, recorded shortly before, and in anticipation of, the retaliatory air-strike campaign. \n\nThe episode has very little assumed knowledge and I strongly recommend it for folks who want to get up to speed on the Houthis' motivations for their campaign and the major role of domestic Yemeni political dynamics in their actions. To summarise below, here's how I TL;DL'd it for some colleagues:\n\nThe Houthi campaign is more than anything about baiting retaliatory airstrikes to unite their fractious coalition and force dissenting factions into line. The Houthis have been at war in one form or another for 20 years and are not afraid of another air strike campaign, which will almost certainly be ineffective and will likely give them the distraction from their domestic failings that they seek. A more intensive, invasive response would be needed to really do anything about them, and nobody has the stomach for another ground war, and they know it. Now that they have seen how staggeringly effective their campaign has been at disrupting trade and putting them in the global headlines, they are highly likely to maintain and intensify their campaign into the longer term. We should expect this threat to become chronic, because it costs pennies for them to maintain and fortunes to defend against.",

China russia and  others all tried to ban western content and produce their own. Even in the West some countries like France are trying to purposefully prevent Americanization. \nEven Nazis and Soviets tried their best to compete with Hollywood.\n\nA cartoon that you watched as a kid would be a building block of the values that you later applied in your life. If every single cartoon had a positive spin on authoritarianism you would definitely be more likely to consider it as a possibly effective system of governance. Just like more democratic and individualistic cartoons make you more likely to appreciate those systems. Cultural products build discourse which in turn builds our political reality.",
