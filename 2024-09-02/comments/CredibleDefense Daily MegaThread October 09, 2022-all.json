        "body": "At the beginning of the war, there was a lot of discussion (at least on reddit, but I think in the OSINT sphere more generally) about what percentage of casualties a Russian unit could take before being rendered 'combat ineffective'.\n\n[Example 1 - Credible Defense, March 21st](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/tjlix2/when_would_the_russian_force_in_ukraine_be/)\n\n[Example 2 - ELI5, March 22nd](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/tk31t1/eli5_why_are_combat_units_ineffective_after/)\n\n15% casualties was the number bandied about a lot, but I am yet to find out where this number came from.\n\nEven the British MOD made comments declaring some units to be combat ineffective, but did not elaborate as to which units these were, how many casualties they took, or what they meant by ineffective.\n\n[Example 3 - British MOD on twitter, May 2nd](https://twitter.com/DefenceHQ/status/1520987841702080512)\n\nSince May or so, this dicussion seems to have disappeared to an extent. Russian units that suffered huge losses have continued to fight on, even without the units being fully or even mostly replenished.\n\nAs an example, look at the [331st Guards Airborne Regiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/331st_Guards_Airborne_Regiment)\n\n>On 29 June 2022, the BBC reported that the death toll for the Regiment had been verified by local Russian media as 80 since the war began, a higher figure than the 56 soldiers that the Regiment lost during the decade long war in Afghanistan. BBC Newsnight's Mark Urban reported on 29 June 2022 that the actual figure of dead was likely to be far higher than the 80 reported, estimating that the total dead, missing in action, and seriously wounded likely totalled 500; half the pre-war strength of the regiment.\n\nYet by August and September, the 331st were [reported to be on the frontlines in Kherson oblast](https://twitter.com/osinttechnical/status/1565146248683864065). Given the Russian manpower shortages (pre-mobilisation), it seems unlikely that this unit was replenished up to full strength before being redeployed to hold the line in Kherson.\n\nThere are many other examples, almost every unit that was involved in the push on Kyiv was redeployed to the battles in Kharkiv, Luhansk, Donetsk or Kherson oblasts without much time to recover. e.g. The [64th Separate Guards Motor Rifle Brigade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64th_Separate_Guards_Motor_Rifle_Brigade) who fought in Bucha, were immediately redeployed to Izyum and Sloviansk, and have apparently taken enough casualties to 'largely cease to exist'.\n\nUpon further research, I came across this paper released in 1986 - [The Relationship of Battle Damage to Unit Combat Performance](https://professionalwargaming.co.uk/TheRelationshipBetweenBattleDamageAndCombatPerformance.pdf)\n\nIt studies 54 different actions between WW1 and the Falklands, mostly about allied (US/British/French forces) and concludes:\n\n>The effect of heavy battle damage on units has been both variable and unpredictable. There is a relationship between losses and the continued willingness to fight, but it defies precise definition. So long as some men in the formation continue to fight as an organized entity, either in attack or defense, for whatever reason, the formation they represent cannot be termed 'Ineffective'.\n\n[This table summarises the results of the battles in WW1, WW2 and the Korean War, mostly from allied data](https://imgur.com/a/GG6ZI6z)\n\nAdditionally, while reading the paper [Soviet Weapon Acquisition System, 1991](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA241165.pdf), I came across this paragraph about Soviet Doctine:\n\n>Another aspect of Soviet logistics philosophy that differs from the Western approach is that the Soviets do not fill units to strength -with replacements the way the West does. Instead, the Soviets allow the unit's size to shrink as a result of the casualties suffered, with the unit often being reorganized into a smaller structure. In this manner the number of companies in a battalion or the number of battalions in a regiment is reduced. By this process, a regiment can shrink to a battalion and even to a company. While some shifting of officer and speciality personnel occurs, for the most part soldiers in a Soviet unit stay together. Unit cohesiveness is believed to have significant psychological benefit to personnel in combat because troops that have fought together and learned to trust each other develop a sense of camaraderie and unity that has a positive effect on combat effectiveness and morale. The process also eliminates some of the psychological problems caused by feeding in new and (to the unit) untried personnel in a combat environment.\n\n>Soviet doctrine states that at some point, a unit has been so decimated by causalities that it can no longer be an effective fighting force and must be dissolved. The Soviet norms appear to have a set time-versus-casualty criteria for dissolution (somewhere between 40 and 60% of effective combat strength after some classified period of timeprobably 3 weeks or less-at a certain level of combat intensity). At the breakup point, the unit is dissolved and its personnel are sent to the rear where they, along with the components of other dissolved units, reservists, and new recruits, are formed into a new major fighting unit.\n\nGiven Russia's lack of doctrinal changes since 1991, it seems likely that this remains official policy.\n\nAll this evidence suggests that there is not some reliable threshold at which units cease to be effective, and it is not a particularly useful way to talk about the combat effectiveness of a unit. In this war, the casualties taken does not seem to correlate well with how likely a unit is to rout or surrender, and other factors like morale or professionalism seem to be far more important.\n\n\n\nX | Low Casualties | High Casualties\n-- |--------------|---------------\n'Low effectiveness' | Rosgvardia in Kharkiv oblast | 4th Guards Tank Division (failed at Kharkiv in March and April, sent to Russia for refitting, routed in Kharkiv in September), Nearly all LPR/DPR mobilised troops\n'High effectiveness' | Most Russian units operating in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts in the early stage of the war | Azov Battalion in Mariupol, VDV in Kherson since May, 93rd Brigade in Sumy and Kharkiv\n\nObviously we don't actually know for sure the casualties taken by any of these units, nor how many reinforcements they received, but we can take some rough guesses.\n\nFinal Remark: I know this is basically all just semantics, as one can define 'Combat Effectiveness' as anything between:\n\n* Can perform any task they would normally be able to at full strength\n* Can perform most tasks, but struggles in offensive operations\n* Can perform some task (e.g holding a line) without routing/surrendering\n\nbut I still think it's interesting to discuss.\n\nTL;DR: Casualties taken is not a good proxy for combat (in)effectiveness",

This is one of those stories that's part of the oral history of the military analytics community (at this point, sadly, basically just The Dupuy Institute and the people who remembered it/worked with it).  Some bright woman in DoD in 1954 pulled a 100 battalion set of daily casualty reports from the National Archives and crunched the numbers. Her initial ballpark product was 40%, but she explicitly stated that the R^2 was pretty bad and that much more work was needed. DoD being DoD, she left about a year later, 40% instead became gospel (sometimes the insipid 15%, usually 30%), no follow on study was performed, and pretty much every DoD wargame since places breakpoints around the 30% mark. \n\nAs you have highlighted, casualties, as she herself noted were a terrible measure and were only supposed to be a threshold question which set the stage for deeper studies. But those never occurred.\n\nI do WWI and WWII casualty mapping. Basically, I take transcribed genealogical data from the Commonwealth Graves Commission (and the scanned French KIA pension cards from WWI) and I use the unit and date of death to create a spreadsheet which tracks, per day, the dead of each battalion, brigade, and division (and corps-army for the French, long story for why not on the British side). With access to the KIA numbers, I can also roughly extrapolate the WIA numbers, to get a total figure of the actual combat losses before the unit started losing POWs.\n\nCasualties have little to do with when a unit breaks/changes stance/stops following the plan. The only thing that really turns the dial are really either (1) being flanked or (2) being shocked, which is really just a frontal assault causing microflanks to emerge. A unit with covered flanks will keep attacking until it's almost gone. The French 3e Division Coloniale, for example, loses ~7,500 of their 12,000 infantrymen as casualties on September 25th, 1915, and was still good for another 4-5 days of serious fighting to consolidate its gains and repel German counterattacks. By contrast, there are plenty of British brigades which cease their attack after maybe 100 casualties total, because they've been flanked and the men hit the dirt. \n\nThis is particularly true when you look at the long duration. A unit slowly being frittered away will not feel the impact of casualties in the same way as a unit which loses the same amount within a day or two.

If they knew where Ukrainian C2 positions were (and could reliably strike them), then they wouldn't have waited for a bridge to be partially blown up before hitting them. They're doing what they've done since day 0 in the conflict - launch a bunch of missiles into Ukraine's main cities, hitting 90% civilian targets, with one or two probably aimed at a TDF headquarters or something. \n\nThe only reason we've seen it less and less in recent months is because Russia used up huge portions of its missile stocks doing this exact thing in the opening months of the war - there's a reason we're seeing S-300 and AShM used in a ground attack role, and it isn't because Russia has a stockpile of 5000 Kalibrs. If Russia could bomb Ukraine 'back to the stone age' (short of using nukes) then they already would have done so.\n\nI agree that Putin does this because he feels he has to domestically - but that doesn't make it a sound decision. Countless wars have proven that terror bombing doesn't work - certainly not on a relatively small scale like this. A few hundred civilians, at most, will die - which is indefensible and a war crime, but also not something that will in any way change Ukrainian calculations about this war, except to maybe harden resolve even further. \n\nGiving the Ukrainians more reasons to reach no settlement with Russia, as well as reinvigorating Western support with flashy, strategically useless strikes, is nothing other than a strategic blunder. If Russia had only ever focused on the Donbas, and not hit civilian targets in Kyiv or Lviv, then do you think Western support would have been anywhere as sizable? All these stunts do are further prove that terror bombing is a useless tactic, and that Putin fundamentally misunderstands the reactions of both Ukrainians and NATO states to these sorts of tactics.

Six men piled into their two Himars: a driver, targeter and commander in each, accompanied by the battery commander and a security detail in an armored personnel carrier. The commander plugged coordinate data into a tablet computer to determine the safest location for firing.\n\n...\n\n>Within minutes, the two Himars rumbled out from cover under an apricot grove toward the launch spot in a nearby sunflower field. Thirty seconds after arriving, they fired seven missiles in quick succession. Before the projectiles hit their targets, the trucks were returning to base camp.\nTen minutes later came another pair of targets: Soviet-era rocket launchers some 44 miles away. Off rolled the Himars again and fired another barrage of missiles. Soon after, the soldiers were back at camp and finishing their dinner. Some pulled up videos on Telegram showing the fruit of their labor: burning Russian barracks.\n\n...\n\n>The supply chain for Himars units consists of factory-packaged rocket pods stashed at pickup points in the nearby countryside and usually hidden by foliage. A cargo truck deposits the camouflage-green pods\u2014each a little bigger than a single bed\u2014at a string of designated locations, not unlike a commercial delivery route. Himars teams drive to the ammo drop spots, where a waiting three-man loading team removes spent pods and swaps in full ones within five minutes, using a crane integrated into the vehicle.\n\n...\n\n>Ukrainian Himars teams stay lean by spending weeks in the field without returning to a larger base. Lt. Koval\u2019s unit, which received the first Himars in June, has spent the past three months sleeping in tents beside the launchers or inside nearby support vehicles. Mission details arrive as geographic coordinates, with a target description and instructions on whether to use explosive missiles for armored targets or fragment charges for hitting personnel. Targeting tips come from sources including U.S. intelligence and partisans in occupied territories.\n\n...\n\n>The Himars commanders then pick a suitable launch location and guide the vehicles into place. Inside the cab, the vehicle commander sits between the driver and the targeter, who feeds the mission data into a computer. When the vehicle reaches the launch site, the targeter presses one button to angle the missiles skyward and another button to fire. The missiles roar into the night sky with a burst of flame, leaving a cloud of smoke over the field.

                    "body": "Just to a expand a bit, the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System(GMLRS) line of rockets was (originally) designed to do the same thing as the original M26 rockets. A battery of four M270s firing off a full salvo of 48 M26 rockets would deliver 30,912 dual-purpose improved conventional munition (DPICM) sub(cluster)munitions at ranges of less than 20 miles. It wasn't designed for counter-battery as Soviet heavy artillery like the 2S7 outranged it. However the M270 could move in, completely saturate a grid with thousands of cluster munitions capable of defeating armor and soft targets, then displace before counter-battery would be a issue.\n\nThe first of the GMLRS *rockets*, the M30, extended the range to a maximum of 57 miles. It still used a reduced number of DPICM submunitions, 414, and added GPS course correction. The M26 has a fairly complex inertia guidance system, ring-laser if I recall correctly. But as you extend range any deviance becomes amplified the further a object travels, so the M30 added the four small control surfaces on the nose and GPS correction. Cluster munitions aren't considered *cool* anymore, much less the DPICM which has a notorious dud rate. So the M31 *rocket* was created which allowed for precision strikes or anti-infantry/soft targets when fuzed for airburst. The M30A1 was created as part of the Alternative Warheads(AW) program and some(perhaps all, no data is available) of the M30 rockets were upgraded to the M30A1 variant or the newer M30A2 variant with a re-grained motor.

                    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Just to a expand a bit, the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System(GMLRS) line of rockets was (originally) designed to do the same thing as the original M26 rockets. A battery of four M270s firing off a full salvo of 48 M26 rockets would deliver 30,912 dual-purpose improved conventional munition (DPICM) sub(cluster)munitions at ranges of less than 20 miles. It wasn&#39;t designed for counter-battery as Soviet heavy artillery like the 2S7 outranged it. However the M270 could move in, completely saturate a grid with thousands of cluster munitions capable of defeating armor and soft targets, then displace before counter-battery would be a issue.</p>\n\n<p>The first of the GMLRS <em>rockets</em>, the M30, extended the range to a maximum of 57 miles. It still used a reduced number of DPICM submunitions, 414, and added GPS course correction. The M26 has a fairly complex inertia guidance system, ring-laser if I recall correctly. But as you extend range any deviance becomes amplified the further a object travels, so the M30 added the four small control surfaces on the nose and GPS correction. Cluster munitions aren&#39;t considered <em>cool</em> anymore, much less the DPICM which has a notorious dud rate. So the M31 <em>rocket</em> was created which allowed for precision strikes or anti-infantry/soft targets when fuzed for airburst. The M30A1 was created as part of the Alternative Warheads(AW) program and some(perhaps all, no data is available) of the M30 rockets were upgraded to the M30A1 variant or the newer M30A2 variant with a re-grained motor. The M30A2 is still in production for the US, Finland, and I wanna say Saudi Arabia but I&#39;d have to check sources for the last one. The M31A2 is the only other rocket in production, which is the same as the M31A1 with a re-grained motor. The M31A1 added improved fuze over the M31. ER GMLRS is still in development.</p>\n</div>",

The US nor Ukraine is party to the  Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM). The US had internally placed a ban against military munitions with a failure rate higher than 1%, but this was overturned during the Trump administration. As for \"illegal\", you'd have to pick a judicial branch. Typically that'd be the International Criminal Court(ICC), which the US, among a number of other nations, isn't party to. Ukraine isn't either, but since 2014 Ukraine accepts the ICC's jurisdiction in their country. So would anything happen if Ukraine was provided cluster munitions and used them, from a legal stand point? I don't know, but my **guess** is no as the only people who are typically prosecuted for war crimes are the losers of a conflict. It would certainly bring international condemnation, as even at the best given rate of 3% failure that's almost 1,000 duds in said salvo. You're effectively salting the Earth. \n\nOn to a topic that I personally find interesting, the DPICM is a small HEAT munition designed with a secondary fragmentation effect for anti-personal uses. Hitting the roof of armored fighting vehicles(AFVs) with one or more was designed to kill said target. On paper it sounds like a absolutely devastating weapon, and the much talked about ATACMS was designed to do the same thing - to deliver DPICMs at greater ranges.

I'd personally note two things, military contracts quite literally go to the lowest bidder which being as massed produced as the DPICM was might explain the high rates of failure. The other being military weapons are rarely used for their intended purposes. The M270 was built on the M2/M3 Bradley chassis so that it could keep up with the M1 Abrams and M2/M3 Bradleys and delivery devastating effects against large formations of Soviet armor and mechanized infantry. \n\nBut ya, the M30A1/M30A2 that has seen a lot of hype in the social media world regarding this war is just a second-rate replacement for the DPICM.",

My understanding is that the fire was burning for around 3 hours, and did seem to be burning very hot. If it has exceeded the temperature thresholds, it is likely that affected areas of steel are now very weak.</p>\n\n<p>Considering these factors, I think the affected spans of the bridge will need to be replaced, and that it certainly won&#39;t be able to be used to its full load until then, even with the tracks replaced.</p>\n</div>",

For example, bottom rung CIA analysts were convinced the US was going to invade Iraq, but didn't have evidence of chemical weapons.

Ukraine as the internationally recognized owner of Crimea has no requirement to provide residence permits to these immigrants.

So to change a bilateral border, both countries have to agree; to change a trilateral border (like a tripoint/trijunction), all three countries have to agree; etc. And in the case of Crimea post-2014, Kyiv clearly **did not** agree to the change.\n\nWhat annoys Russian elites is that they feel - with some basis - that the West does not apply rules consistently. Kosovo in particular really irks them. Not because they care about the Serbs - they don't, really - but because in their minds, if Kosovo can leave Serbia without Belgrade's consent, then why can't Transnistria leave Moldova? Why can't Abkhazia and South Ossetia leave Georgia? *And why can't Crimea leave Ukraine?*\n\nThe standard Western retort to these questions is to use some combination of the terms \"false equivalency,\" \"whataboutism,\" \"sui generis,\" etc. Thing about the \"rules-based international order\" is that for it to have any real meaning, everybody has to follow the rules. Nobody respects \"do as I say, not as I do.\"",

There's a lot of \"watch events carefully, the wheels are turning\" and so on.\n\nBut the **upshot** of the article is that as the war gets worse:\n\n>...rival [factions will] seek to conserve whatever fighting forces they have, either to protect their own personal interests during an unpredictable time, or to make a play for Moscow.... it will soon seem foolish for everyone involved to have armed forces located in distant Ukraine, or, for that matter, to get them killed there day after day.  Then comes a tipping point. Once some people realize that other people are holding back their men, it will seem senseless to expend (or alienate) one's own. \n\n>At a certain moment, this logic applies to the Russian army itself...  if the army wants to have a role in Russian politics or prestige in Russian society, its commanders have an incentive to pull back while they still have units to command.  And if Putin himself wants to remain in power, neither a discredited nor a demoralized army is in his interest. \n\n>The logic of the situation favors he who realizes this most quickly, and is able to control and redeploy.  Once the cascade begins, it quickly makes no sense for anyone to have any Russian forces in Ukraine at all.  Again, from this it does not necessarily follow that there will be armed clashes in Russia: it is just that, as the instability created by the war in Ukraine comes home, Russian leaders who wish to gain from that instability, or protect themselves from it, will want their power centers close to Moscow. \n\nThe article fingers Prigozhin (Wagner Group) and Kadyrov (\"the de facto dictator of Chechnya\") as two Russian power players who are already conserving their forces for a coming power struggle.\n\nYou might notice the logic of the article is backwards. Yes, **IF** there is a power struggle in Moscow, it makes a lot of sense for Prigozhin to keep elite Wagner troops in Moscow while sending convicts to die in Bakhmut. But this scenario does not answer **HOW** such a power struggle would kick off in the first place.\n\nTo me, the logic of coups is simple. There are 3 ingredients of a coup:\n\nA) **PERFORMANCE** the current leader is doing an existentially bad job\n\nB) **CREDIBILITY** there are one or more figures who would be credible as a replacement commander of the state's forces\n\nC) **TURNAROUND POTENTIAL** A successor could quickly alter policies or make other changes that reduce the population's discontent and salvage the state's geostrategic problems.\n\nTo my eyes, Putin has been doing a good job of keeping B and C from materializing. \n\nOn the B front, Putin may not have an Orwellian control of Russian society & infoscape, but he has prevented the emergence of any credible opposition leader. There is a difference between an opposition figure and a regime critic. Someone like Navalny is firmly the latter. And Snyder's own shortlist of challenges to Putin's power is awfully thin when he can only populate it with 2 figures, both of whom have pledged loyalty to Putin, served his interests and are as likely to fall with him as to succeed him. Snyder rightly doesn't even discuss Shoigu.\n\nOn the C) front, Putin has done a good job of making Russia's position **untenable** for a successor. Blowing up the pipelines & annexing the territories were not good moves for Russia, they were *bad* moves for a Putin successor. No successor could now quickly extricate themselves from Ukraine and renormalize diplomatic & economic relations with Europe.\n\nTo be very clear: without B there's no person who could nucleate a pro-coup force; without C no such person is likely to emerge. Would *you* want the job?\n\nRather than a **\"factional power struggle in Moscow\"** IMO what is far more likely is a disorganized, leaderless, hopeless and quickly crushed eruption of popular protests as the war goes on. More similar to the Hong Kong situation than a coup. \n\nThese kinds of protests are not hard to anticipate or plan for in a country that has a primate city. Russia has two. The entire NYC metro area (including parts of New Jersey) has about 6% of the USA's population, but Moscow has nearly 14% of Russia's people. St Petersburg another 4%. The big protests will happen there, and be crushed there. Plays for autonomy/independence elsewhere in the RF aren't existential threats to Putin and can be dealt with on a much more relaxed timetable.",

So while Wagniks fall outside of the definition of a mercenary under Geneva, there's still two distinct questions to be asked:\n\n1. Are they entitled to POW status under GCIII?\n2. Are they lawful combatants?\n\nThe first answer is plausibly yes, as even civilians who work for the military has a right to POW status. It could appy to Wagner as well, but there is some technicalities to it. As per [GCIII art. 4](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/Article.xsp?action=openDocument&documentId=2F681B08868538C2C12563CD0051AA8D):\n\n>Prisoners of war, in the sense of the present Convention, are persons belonging to one of the following categories, who have fallen into the power of the enemy:  \n>  \n>\\[...\\]  \n>  \n>(4) Persons who accompany the armed forces without actually being members thereof, such as civilian members of military aircraft crews, war correspondents, supply contractors, members of labour units or of services responsible for the welfare of the armed forces, provided that they have received authorization from the armed forces which they accompany, who shall provide them for that purpose with an identity card similar to the annexed model.\n\nAs for the second question; Wagniks are not members of the armed forces of a belingerent nation. They are *empoyees*, or *contractors* of a company, but they're not under it's command any more than the manager is the *commanding officer* of the people working in his store. Wagner evidently lacks a proper mechanism to enforce discipline and compliance to the laws of war. Finally, the Russian state does not to my knowledge admit full control or responsibility over them. Therefore they are not entitled to participate in combat.\n\n[Combatants under art. 43 of Additional  Protocol 1](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/Article.xsp?action=openDocument&documentId=AF64638EB5530E58C12563CD0051DB93)\n\n>1. The armed forces of a Party to a conflict consist of all organized armed forces, groups and units which are under a command responsible to that Party for the conduct of its subordinates, even if that Party is represented by a government or an authority not recognized by an adverse Party. Such armed forces shall be subject to an internal disciplinary system which, ' inter alia ', shall enforce compliance with the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict.   \n>  \n>2. Members of the armed forces of a Party to a conflict (other than medical personnel and chaplains covered by Article 33 \\[ Link \\] of the Third Convention) are combatants, that is to say, they have the right to participate directly in hostilities.\n\nSo what does that entail? POW status isn't a free pass from being punished for crimes one has committed before being captured. While under Protocol 1, privileged combatants can not be punished for following lawful orders. Wagniks have no such right. Actions such as shooting at people with firearms, considered serious crimes in civilian society are for Wagner still just that. Hence they are common criminals and can be tried as such.",

Here's why you are all wrong, with a simple exmaple.\n\nGoing to use arbitrary numbers, but would extend to this case in terms of 'random' cases (as opposed to 'planned' cases, in which of course you detonate a truck next to the train).\n\nSuppose vehicles travel at 90km/h, and trains at 60km/h.

The difference is you see a LOT more head-on trains. In the real example here, it means the chance of seeing a head-on train is a lot higher than seeing an alongside train, since if there's an alongside train there is a good chance you just don't bump into it since its going the same direction over a 24km span.\n\nOF course, academic because this was a same-direction train.

This is all assuming the leading theory is 'truck had a bomb of some sort'. Exploring that theory, I did some back of the envelope math.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n\\- Only trains going into Crimea are highly explosive or combustible (containing fuel, ammo, build materials). Trains going out are likely to have salvage or other things that wont be very explosive. Further, the train showed appears to have been going the same direction.\n\n\\- Trains being used are on average 2 km long. This is not long and not short.\n\n\\- Trains zip along at a safe but fairly quick 60 km/h\n\n\\- A heavily laded truck will drive kind of safely, call it 90 km/h\n\n\\-  The span is 24km. But only about 16km or so of that is really over water I think?\n\n\\- Trains leave hourly headed into Crimea. This is fairly heavy traffic I believe.  It's likely less.  This makes the calculation more generous to an accident thesis.\n\nGoing into that, that means that if you are randomly starting trucks and trains, over a VERY long course:\n\n\\- A truck would pass a train going the same direction about once per 2 hours (30kph of speed difference, and there is 60km distance between trains that leave once hourly at 60km/h.)\n\n\\- The time to pass is quick, 30km/h difference passing 2 km is 4 minutes.\n\n\\- The span is 16km, so at 90km/h, takes .1777 hours to transverse, or 10.66  minutes.\n\n\\- Thus, chance of encountering a same-direction train is about 8.88%. And, of your trip, about 1/4 of the time is alongside the train if you do encounter it. Of course, maybe some of the train is non-flammable. So, maybe halve that again, that the explosion happened to light something up.\n\n**Thus, if this was a truck bomb, the chance of randomly blowing up a flammable train on the back of a bonefide accidental fertilizer truck explosion is GENEROUSLY 1.11%. More likely it's well less than 1%. Given a train was hit, it strongly indicates intentional timing, and not an accident. Furthermore, it implies that the timing was controlled by active intelligence in the form of image intelligence that could allow a controller to detonate when near an explosive part of the train - or - that there was a trigger on the train and it was known they would intercept - which seems hard to believe and is far more prone to failure. The simplest version of this would be the driver suicide bombing. But could be remote too - guessing we will know soon definitively on that point unless we do already, have not kept up with all news today.**\n\nI didn't think it was an accident before that, but this is a further layer of implausibility and it includes a timing element and implies active control and live intel - there were 99 out of 100 other ways it could've blown up and NOT hit a train.\n\nI know the counterargument here is that the train could've been more damaged perhaps. But the probability of even being next to the train is a couple percent max if my assumptions are generally correct.

Sure, Chechnya demonstrates that Putin does not object to leveling cities/towns in a way that hasn\u2019t yet been done to Ukraine (at least not to the major urban areas afaik), but is it possible that there\u2019s at least some desire to preserve basic infrastructure so as to not have to rebuild it in the event of a Russian victory?

I guess I meant \u201cdangerous\u201d more in terms of \u201cwould hamper the Ukrainian war effort if it could be done,\u201d less so that it\u2019s a tool in the toolbox that Russia hasn\u2019t pulled out yet (which I suppose would be more like the hypothetical nuclear/chemical strike).</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m not an engineer by training, so I can\u2019t speak to the specifics, but I\u2019ve heard people talk about the fact that the Ukrainian power grid has been fortified and hooked up to the EU at large, which I assume would make it harder to take it out militarily.</p>\n\n<p>While the idea that \u201cif it were possible/effective, it would have been done already\u201d seems true to me, I wonder if there\u2019s also some merit to the idea that Russia does not want to be ruling over a pile of rubble. Sure, Chechnya demonstrates that Putin does not object to leveling cities/towns in a way that hasn\u2019t yet been done to Ukraine (at least not to the major urban areas afaik), but is it possible that there\u2019s at least some desire to preserve basic infrastructure so as to not have to rebuild it in the event of a Russian victory?

Second, Russia is mostly using its foreign reserves to shore up the ruble. They\u2019ll stop doing that at some point if the situation with the currency doesn\u2019t improve. The current official rate is artificial, and they may let the ruble depreciate closer to reality of/when things get worse. Ukraine has done this, for example. Third, Russia\u2019s imports have plummeted and FX reserves are most important for import cover. Hence, it\u2019s not a significant issue yet. FX reserves are not really a good indicator of the stress on the Russian economy. Four, I wouldn\u2019t trust any official data coming out of Russia, the same way no market participant trusts Chinese official economic and monetary data. Five, wars of choice generally do end because of their economic drain and unpopularity at home, but Russia isn\u2019t anywhere close to that point. A military defeat is still the best way to end this war at this point. Wars of necessity, or at least perceived necessity (North Korea is a good example) can linger on for much longer.",

They certainly want to be the &quot;Good Guys&quot; and generally portray a civilized image, but dropping the Kerch bridge by deliberately sacrificing a civilian might be worth the image-risk for the potential military gain. How many mass graves full of Ukranian civilians would you trade for one unfortunate truck driver? </p>\n\n<p>Regardless, as of now we don&#39;t know enough to dismiss or confirm any possibilities. We may never know for sure what happened because everyone involved has significant incentive to lie and obfuscate the truth. It could be that it wasn&#39;t a truck bomb, and the Ukranian &quot;leak&quot; is just a misdirection designed to play into the Russian narrative. It could be that it was a truck bomb, but the guy was a willing participant. Or maybe the SBU had his kid held at gunpoint and he tearfully went to his death.

        "body": "Many eagle-eyed analysts have reviewed the surveillance footage of the bridge attack frame by frame and have detected the presence of a boat\u2014others have detected a missile.\n\nMany have carefully applied their knowledge of forensic science and have concluded that the explosion could only have come from below\u2014others have concluded that it must have come from above.\n\nLogically, at least one of these factions must be wrong, but how can that be? How can so many of our highly intelligent and not even slightly mentally ill colleagues hallucinate things that aren't there?\n\nLest we accuse any of our esteemed peers of engaging in the same species of crankery that commonly emerge in the wake of spectacular events, allow me to propose a unified framework which harmonizes all these seemingly contradictory observations: the SMVREO, or, the Simultaneous Multi-Vectoral Redundancy-Enhanced Operation.\n\nWhen striking a high-value target in a heavily securitized hostile environment, it only makes sense to deploy redundant operational prongs which can be independently activated even if parallel efforts are intercepted in order to overwhelm enemy detection systems through their mutually diversionary effect. Furthermore, their kinetic intensity can be synergestically multiplied in the event of their simultaneous deployment.

At the minimum, the goal of mobilization would be to find another few hundred thousand such men  among those who, for whatever reason, did not take the initiative of joining the army of their own accord. Reports from mobilization stations seem to suggest that this isn't a difficult task - just as many accounts report logistical difficulties, they also report that most conscripts are 'determined', and honestly that's mostly how the conscripts look in the videos. So I think it's safe to assume that mobilization will give Russia many more men who will be willing to fight just as hard and die for the cause, with the downside being that they will die much more quickly than a trained contract soldier. \n\nIt's a common refrain here that human wave attacks don't work and that the Russians' numerical advantage would matter little on a modern battlefield. But - isn't the situation in Bakhmut a rebuttal of that? The Russians keep throwing wave after wave after wave of bodies at it, losing a bunch of them, but ultimately attriting and exhausting the defenders. What's to keep Russia from doing the same *everywhere* once they have the needed number of willing bodies? And if they start doing that, how could Ukraine and the West realistically counter that?",
