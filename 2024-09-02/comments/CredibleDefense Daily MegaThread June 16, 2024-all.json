Smoothebore artillery would have cheaper barrels, longer lifespans, and boast slightly higher max range due to increased available muzzle velocity.\n\nBut the cost issue is a large one. It's still very difficult to make guided shells. An additional counter argument, is that at least in the counter-battery role, rocket artillery will continue to outrange tube artillery.

In addition to contemporary ground-launched suicide drones, I expect drone-swarm sub-munitions to enter the fray shortly. Instead of DPICM or other sub-munitions, rockets and air dropped bombs will release drone sub-munitions above a target area, with each seeking out targets individually. It is the natural progression from the current BLU-108 and similar sub-munitions. \n\nIn the very near-future, I expect tube artillery may be somewhat overshadowed by suicide drones. However this will revert the moment drone countermeasures mature. It will be a long time until there is no place for an un-jammable heavy explosive shell falling from the sky at speed.",

        "body": "An article that gives an overview of how the U.S. wants to use the development of unmanned systems to protect Taiwan.  It's been dubbed 'Hellscape.' Picking out a quote from Admiral Samuel Paparo, Commander, INDOPACOM gives the most direct understanding of how it would work. *\u201cI want to turn the Taiwan Strait into an unmanned hellscape using a number of classified capabilities so I can make their lives utterly miserable for a month, which buys me the time for the rest of everything.\u201d*\n\n[Breaking Down the U.S. Navy\u2019s \u2018Hellscape\u2019 in Detail: 'Hellscape' is the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command's future asymmetric battlefield. What does it look like and what does it involve? | Naval News | June 2024](https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2024/06/breaking-down-the-u-s-navys-hellscape-in-detail/)\n\n*\u2018Hellscape\u2019 envisions a battlefield filled with tens of thousands of unmanned ships, aircraft, and submarines all working in tandem to engage thousands of targets across the vast span of the West Pacific. Admiral John Aquilino, former commander of the Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM), originally coined the term in August 2023 at the Emerging Technologies for Defense Conference and Exhibition.*\n\n*The concept, at its core, leverages the Department of Defense\u2019s initiative to rapidly procure and field large amounts of unmanned systems, taking critical lessons from the ongoing War in Ukraine that has revolutionized unmanned warfare. Owing to these lessons, Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks announced the Department\u2019s Replicator initiative at the same conference in 2023. Since then, the program has been hard at work developing new capabilities.*\n\n*\u2018Hellscape\u2019 and \u2018Replicator\u2019 are closely related to each other and many of the capabilities set to be delivered in the Replicator program will have direct applications to the Hellscape concept envisioned by INDOPACOM. Replicator itself has sought out to deliver the exact capabilities that the Hellscape concept refers to.*\n\n\n*INDOPACOM\u2019s \u2018Hellscape\u2019 concept will feature unmanned systems in every domain. From High-Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) UAVs like the U.S. Navy\u2019s MQ-4C Triton maritime patrol aircraft, down to one-way attack unmanned surface vessels (USVs) like the Muskie M18 developed by MARTAC. In between will be a myriad of different platforms that provide a number of unique capabilities to the overall \u2018Hellscape\u2019 concept.*\n\n*A major concept being pursued that applies to \u2018Hellscape\u2019 is the U.S. Navy\u2019s \u2018Project Overmatch\u2019; the branch\u2019s contribution to the overall Department of Defense Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2) effort to mesh information flows into one combined picture. EpiSci was recently awarded a follow-on contract to continue their efforts for this program. Project Overmatch, as a concept, fits directly into the \u2018Hellscape\u2019 concept of a networked force of asymmetric systems that can coalesce to deliver solid punches despite being made up of small components of an overall networked force.*\n\n*Most prominent are the various procurements of one-way attack drones like the AeroVironment Switchblade 600 or UVison Hero-120. The U.S. Marine Corps are specifically focused on loitering munitions and one-way attack drones and have issued contracts in 2021 and 2024 for integration and procurement of various unmanned systems. This year, UVision announced that the Hero-120 would be produced in the U.S.\u2013likely due to demand for the system.*\n\n*A mix of these systems, alongside countless other classified capabilities and unmentioned procurement efforts highlight the drive to make \u2018Hellscape\u2019 a reality. The U.S. Marine Corps unveiled a concept last year of Hero-120 loitering munitions installed on a Long-Range Unmanned Surface Vessel (LRUSV), showcasing just what is possible when these systems are integrated together. The LRUSV, based on the U.S. Navy\u2019s \u201940PB\u2019 built by Metal Shark, is yet another example of how \u2018Hellscape\u2019 is already becoming a reality.*\n\n*Concepts developed by firms like Ocean Power Technologies (OPT), a leading organization in maritime power generation, could be used to power this \u2018Hellscape\u2019. All unmanned systems have a limited quantity of power and fuel onboard for sustained operations. OPT\u2019s PB3 PowerBuoy could be deployed by U.S. Navy ships to recharge USVs and UUVs while providing secure data transfer capabilities. OPT has also developed unmanned mine countermeasure craft on their WAM-V USV, a current candidate for \u2018Replicator\u2019.*\n\n*The vision of \u2018Hellscape\u2019 is clear in the Department of Defense and dozens of active programs, some under the Replicator initiatives and others independent of it, are pushing towards the bigger picture of an Indo-Pacific full of unmanned systems in a hypothetical war.*\n\n*\u2018Hellscape\u2019 is fundamentally an asymmetric concept. Designed as a delaying action, the systems that make up \u2018Hellscape\u2019 would be used in massive numbers to impede any attempted invasion force while causing the highest level of damage possible, allowing U.S. and allied forces adequate time to set up necessary logistics and forward-based forces in the West Pacific. This could include the deployment of Marine Littoral Regiments (MLRs), Army Multi-Domain Task Forces (MDTFs), and Navy Carrier Strike Groups (CSGs) dedicated to longer term, high-end operations.*\n\n*Days and weeks prior to conflict, the United States and allies would likely know with high certainty about an impending invasion. This could set in motion a rapid deployment of unmanned systems deployed in-theater beforehand, much like the MQ-9 Reaper UAVs already deployed in the Philippines and recent unmanned surface vessel (USV) deployments to the Pacific last year. These assets are easier to move, carried in standard shipping containers and onboard large transport aircraft that can quickly preposition large numbers of these assets. According to the U.S. Navy, thousands of these systems would be thrown at an invasion force, networked together into one large picture. \u2018Project Overmatch\u2019 would play a large part in this connectivity.*\n\n*Unmanned vehicles can also be delivered by ship and submarine. DARPA recently picked six companies to further their effort in developing ship-launched infrastructure-free unmanned aircraft, and the U.S. Navy already completed tests of an underwater UUV launched from a Virginia-class fast-attack submarine. Various other UUVs are in different stages of development, with many focused on extended-range sensor coverage and battlespace awareness. This combination of land, surface, and undersea delivery methods for a wide variety of unmanned systems will add to the overall weight behind the punch that \u2018Hellscape\u2019 can offer.*\n\n*In practice, this could look like thousands of unmanned systems launched from submarines, surface ships, aircraft, and land-based vehicles dispersed across the West Pacific. across several days and weeks as war breaks out in the Pacific; a grim but honest reality. The goal would be to delay the initial elements of an invading force for a long enough time to allow a major transit of ships, submarines, and aircraft from the United States to bases across the Pacific.*\n\n*The second role of \u2018Hellscape\u2019 could be to gather intelligence and put infrastructure in place to support a GPS and intelligence denied environment. Unmanned systems like Saildrone\u2019s Surveyor SD-3000 and Textron\u2019s Aerosonde UAV can provide intelligence where gaps exist in satellite or manned aircraft overflights, giving allied forces a complete image of the battlefield at all times in early days and weeks of a conflict when real-time intelligence is difficult to collect. Concepts of this network have already been tested by NAVSEA earlier this year.*\n\n*Connected by satellite, HALE UAVs, and other aspects of \u2018Project Overmatch\u2019 that network, drones would engage large amphibious fleets crossing the Taiwan Strait from multiple vectors, coming from islands, undersea, and from drone motherships far outside the first island chain. One-way attack drones would be used to deplete large amounts of surface-to-air missiles carried by fleet escorts, while submarines launch UUVs to silently monitor waters hundreds of miles away. Attritable intelligence gathering USVs, UUVs, and UAVs would also operate on the front lines, dispersed across hundreds of miles to maximize coverage, giving allied forces a single, fused image of the battlespace with the help of \u2018Project Overmatch\u2019.*\n\n*Exact details of how this would look in a real wartime scenario remain classified.*\n\n*\u2018Hellscape\u2019 is by no means the only plan the U.S. has in response to a potential invasion of Taiwan. Officially, the United States does not make a clear-cut policy in regards to this matter. But in the event that the United States does move to defend Taiwan from an invasion, \u2018Hellscape\u2019 will only be the first of many parts of a much larger plan.*",

And, has it been lauded by the US defence circle?\n\nOh, I love this, excellent work. Bravo.\n\nIn the US, we have freedom of speech. We love Freedom of Speech. We love it so much, that we'd rather allow literally hundreds of paid propagandists to post in our social media than ban one person who seeks to speak his mind openly.\n\nFor this reason, reddit, is awash in Chinese nationalist propagandists, particularly in defense subs.\n\nThis shouldn't be surprising to anyone posting here.\n\n[https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/05/19/meet-the-chinese-internet-trolls-pumping-488-million-posts-harvard-stanford-ucsd-research/](https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/05/19/meet-the-chinese-internet-trolls-pumping-488-million-posts-harvard-stanford-ucsd-research/)\n\n[https://www.cfr.org/blog/chinas-internet-trolls-go-global](https://www.cfr.org/blog/chinas-internet-trolls-go-global)\n\n[https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research\\_reports/RR4300/RR4373z3/RAND\\_RR4373z3.pdf](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR4300/RR4373z3/RAND_RR4373z3.pdf)\n\nBut here's the thing, while our values dictate that we must allow large numbers of disinformation pushers on our social media platforms, they certainly don't dictate that we must take their bullshit seriously.\n\nI find it absolutely hilarious that you cite China's own disinformation efforts in reddit subs in support of  your pro-China narrative here. Yes, this and other defense reddits are awash in paid Chinese Nationalist propagandists, and part of their job is to cast doubt on the US's ability to wage war in Taiwan - precisely by attacking reports like the one issued by CSIS.\n\nBut why would anyone take that fact as some kind of evidence that the report itself isn't credible?\n\nIts always worth noting that reddit is banned in China and that China has a relatively small number of fluent English speakers. Despite that many defense reddits read like a PLA PR statement.\n\nYou've already given one completely non-credible claim - the claim that the US cannot operate submarines in the Taiwan strait. Then you make this claim:\n\n>The report also makes very little mention on how the US is even going to be able to get its ISR assets close enough to be able to even target China\u2019s landing vessels.\n\nOh yeah, I love this. How could the US possibly get ISR on the Taiwan strait? That's a tough nut to crack isn't it? Maybe the fact that Taiwan you know... is an ally, and is chock full of highly capable air defenses and anti-ship radars has something to do with it eh? Maybe their land based radars would help... or even... you know... binoculars?\n\nI bet most binoculars are made in China aren't they? No wonder you think the US's ISR over the strait is incapable of targeting a Chinese invasion fleet. How would we get binoculars in a war when China is the one that makes them?\n\nAn RQ-180 could... like... fly around Taiwan, protected by the air defenses provided by Taiwan's numerous anti-air systems. Its stealth, is presumably the good kind of stealth too, not like a J-20. If the B-21 can operate as a Stand-In bomber as stated by US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, surely the most advanced US drones are capable of loitering hundreds of miles away eh?",

We love it so much, that we&#39;d rather allow literally hundreds of paid propagandists to post in our social media than ban one person who seeks to speak his mind openly.</p>\n\n<p>For this reason, reddit, is awash in Chinese nationalist propagandists, particularly in defense subs.</p>\n\n<p>This shouldn&#39;t be surprising to anyone posting here.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/05/19/meet-the-chinese-internet-trolls-pumping-488-million-posts-harvard-stanford-ucsd-research/\">https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/05/19/meet-the-chinese-internet-trolls-pumping-488-million-posts-harvard-stanford-ucsd-research/</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/blog/chinas-internet-trolls-go-global\">https://www.cfr.org/blog/chinas-internet-trolls-go-global</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR4300/RR4373z3/RAND_RR4373z3.pdf\">https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR4300/RR4373z3/RAND_RR4373z3.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>But here&#39;s the thing, while our values dictate that we must allow large numbers of disinformation pushers on our social media platforms, they certainly don&#39;t dictate that we must take their bullshit seriously.</p>\n\n<p>I find it absolutely hilarious that you cite China&#39;s own disinformation efforts in reddit subs in support of  your pro-China narrative here. Yes, this and other defense reddits are awash in paid Chinese Nationalist propagandists, and part of their job is to cast doubt on the US&#39;s ability to wage war in Taiwan - precisely by attacking reports like the one issued by CSIS.</p>\n\n<p>But why would anyone take that fact as some kind of evidence that the report itself isn&#39;t credible?</p>\n\n<p>Its always worth noting that reddit is banned in China and that China has a relatively small number of fluent English speakers. Despite that many defense reddits read like a PLA PR statement.</p>\n\n<p>You&#39;ve already given one completely non-credible claim - the claim that the US cannot operate submarines in the Taiwan strait. Then you make this claim:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The report also makes very little mention on how the US is even going to be able to get its ISR assets close enough to be able to even target China\u2019s landing vessels.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Oh yeah, I love this. How could the US possibly get ISR on the Taiwan strait? That&#39;s a tough nut to crack isn&#39;t it? Maybe the fact that Taiwan you know... is an ally, and is chock full of highly capable air defenses and anti-ship radars has something to do with it eh? Maybe their land based radars would help... or even... you know... binoculars?</p>\n\n<p>I bet most binoculars are made in China aren&#39;t they? No wonder you think the US&#39;s ISR over the strait is incapable of targeting a Chinese invasion fleet. How would we get binoculars in a war when China is the one that makes them?</p>\n\n<p>An RQ-180 could... like... fly around Taiwan, protected by the air defenses provided by Taiwan&#39;s numerous anti-air systems. Its stealth, is presumably the good kind of stealth too, not like a J-20. If the B-21 can operate as a Stand-In bomber as stated by US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, surely the most advanced US drones are capable of loitering hundreds of miles away eh?</p>\n</div>",

Like during the gulf war, Yugoslavia bombings, and ongoing yemen campaign, the iraqis, serbians, and houthis all kept up high degrees of fire for months, with the majority of their arsenal NATO/US failing to take out.

I\u2019m not super familiar with the conditions of Ukrainian prisons though, maybe they also have rampant sexual abuse and a strict hierarchy too.</p>\n</div>",

Nor is it moral imo.\n\nTheir duty is to serve in the IDF and pay taxes. But just like the IDF accommodates vegans, LGBTQ and adjusts for women, so it has to adjust to Ultraorthodox way of life.\n\nThe purpose of the IDF is not reeducation, it's the defense of the state.
