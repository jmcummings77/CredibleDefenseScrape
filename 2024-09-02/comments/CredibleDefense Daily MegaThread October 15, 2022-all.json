        "body": "A lot of people are asking what could Iran possibly gain from supplying Russia with arms. I am going to make an answer from the perspective of the Iranian security establishment.\n\nFirst, let's talk benefits. The obvious one is that Iran gets paid for arms shipments but that is actually the least important benefit. The main goal of these deliveries is to unlock a true strategic relationship with Russia. Despite being called allies, Russia and Iran never were. In Syria, they compete almost as much as they cooperated. Russia took years before agreeing to transfer S-300 batteries to Iran despite receiving payment for them and Russia also approved UN sanctions on Iran in the 2000s. They are also rivals for influence in the Caucasus and Central Asia. Finally, Russia had good relations with Saudi Arabia and Israel and could never be a true Iranian ally.\n\nWith the war everything changes. Now Russia is willing to sell advanced arms and transfer technology to Iran. It agreed to sell 24 Su-35s and launch a satellite into space for Iran and this is just a beginning. These are all areas where Iran lags severely and needs Russian tech.\n\nEconomic benefits: Russia sold Iran [5 millions tons](https://www.reuters.com/article/iran-russia-grains-idAFS8N2UW05O) of wheat reportedly at a preferential rate. Useful when you are facing high inflation and protests. Gazprom will invest in Iran gas industry (second reserves in the world and heavily under capitalized) and help with tech transfers. These are all strategic.\n\nGeopolitical benefits: Russia and Iran have a direct link by the Caspian sea. This link can't be severed by the United States / NATO unless they declare war on Russia because of the Caspian sea convention. This is the single most underrated aspect of the Iran / Russia relationship because it means that if Iran, a US adversary, was fighting a war with the United States, it would have a supply link with another US adversary, Russia, that would be almost impossible to disable kinetically. Just think how Poland is important for western efforts to send arms to Ukraine. Before the war, this came up often in war gaming but was deemed as unimportant as the United States could simply threaten sanctions on Russia but now it is not the case anymore. De facto this greatly increases Iranian deterrence because fighting a war against Iran would most likely morph into a proxy war where Russia and possibly China can supply it via the Caspian Sea. Iranian strategy then centers around replying to limited US strikes with tit-for-tat attacks (like the 2020 missile attack on the Al Asad Airbase in Iraq) knowing escalation towards large scale war is less likely.\n\nSecond, I will cover the costs. Economic sanctions are the biggest risk when any country tries to supplies arms to Russia. The US administration warned China not to supply Russia and threatened sanctions which reportedly worked. This however did not work on Iran since de facto sanction leverage is already [maxed out](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/y4m4ln/comment/isivn0t/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). The Iranian perspective is \"We are under harsher sanctions than Russia and North Korea while we didn't build nukes nor invade a neighbor so we have no incentive to show restraint.\".\n\nThen there are diplomatic and military costs. Iran already has no diplomatic relations with the United States and have bad relations with most of Europe so again the costs are low. Ukraine downgraded relations with Iran as a result of the deliveries but that is an acceptable cost for Iran. Military costs: the United States could launch attacks against Iran drone production / storage facilities but this is highly unlikely. If the US has still not attacked nuclear enrichment facilities, it is unlikely to attack drone facilities.\n\nFor all these reasons the cost / benefit calculus is clear from the Iranian perspective when supplying arms to Russia.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>A lot of people are asking what could Iran possibly gain from supplying Russia with arms. I am going to make an answer from the perspective of the Iranian security establishment.</p>\n\n<p>First, let&#39;s talk benefits. The obvious one is that Iran gets paid for arms shipments but that is actually the least important benefit. The main goal of these deliveries is to unlock a true strategic relationship with Russia. Despite being called allies, Russia and Iran never were. In Syria, they compete almost as much as they cooperated. Russia took years before agreeing to transfer S-300 batteries to Iran despite receiving payment for them and Russia also approved UN sanctions on Iran in the 2000s. They are also rivals for influence in the Caucasus and Central Asia. Finally, Russia had good relations with Saudi Arabia and Israel and could never be a true Iranian ally.</p>\n\n<p>With the war everything changes. Now Russia is willing to sell advanced arms and transfer technology to Iran. It agreed to sell 24 Su-35s and launch a satellite into space for Iran and this is just a beginning. These are all areas where Iran lags severely and needs Russian tech.</p>\n\n<p>Economic benefits: Russia sold Iran <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/iran-russia-grains-idAFS8N2UW05O\">5 millions tons</a> of wheat reportedly at a preferential rate. Useful when you are facing high inflation and protests. Gazprom will invest in Iran gas industry (second reserves in the world and heavily under capitalized) and help with tech transfers. These are all strategic.</p>\n\n<p>Geopolitical benefits: Russia and Iran have a direct link by the Caspian sea. This link can&#39;t be severed by the United States / NATO unless they declare war on Russia because of the Caspian sea convention. This is the single most underrated aspect of the Iran / Russia relationship because it means that if Iran, a US adversary, was fighting a war with the United States, it would have a supply link with another US adversary, Russia, that would be almost impossible to disable kinetically. Just think how Poland is important for western efforts to send arms to Ukraine. Before the war, this came up often in war gaming but was deemed as unimportant as the United States could simply threaten sanctions on Russia but now it is not the case anymore. De facto this greatly increases Iranian deterrence because fighting a war against Iran would most likely morph into a proxy war where Russia and possibly China can supply it via the Caspian Sea. Iranian strategy then centers around replying to limited US strikes with tit-for-tat attacks (like the 2020 missile attack on the Al Asad Airbase in Iraq) knowing escalation towards large scale war is less likely.</p>\n\n<p>Second, I will cover the costs.

Sanctions do inflict economic pain but the initial policy before the invasion, according to the US administration, was deterring Russia from invading. That failed. Then the policy was compelling Russia to stop their invasion. That also failed.\n\nNow the policy is to weaken Russia enough so that they lose the long term attritional war.

The commission said it had uncovered evidence of war crimes, including cases of rape and torture of children, without specifying the number of alleged cases.  \n\n>But Patten was more specific in her comments.\n\n>>\u201cWhen you hear women testify about Russian soldiers equipped with Viagra, it\u2019s clearly a military strategy,\u201d Patten said on Thursday. \n\n>Patten repeated that the age of the sexual violence victims in the cases the UN has investigated ranges **from four to 82-years old.

This is absolutely going to hobble progress in the long-run</p>\n</div>",

Issued a new advisory today for citizens to evacuate Ukraine due to dangerous security situation, not officially announced on Embassy webpage.\n\nKazakhstan: Announced it was planning the evacuation of its embassy staff on the 11th due to dangerous security situation. Is not closing embassy.\n\nTurkmenistan: On the Turkmenistan Embassy website, they posted an announcement on the 12th encouraging all citizens to leave Ukraine. They specifically cited rocket attacks across the country as the reason. No mention of embassy staff.\n\nTajikistan: No evidence that Tajikistan ordered an evacuation recently. Nothing on their embassy website.\n\nUzbekistan: On the 11th, Uzbekistan \"once again\" urged its citizens to leave Ukraine, specifically citing increased rocket and artillery attacks on Ukrainian territory as the reason. No word on evacuating embassy staff.\n\nKyrgyzstan: On the 10th, Kyrgyzstan embassy posted an announcement encouraging (again) all citizens to leave Ukraine. They cited rocket attacks and the damage to energy infrastructure (along with the potential of martial law) as the main reason for their announcement. Specifically stated that embassy staff are to remain and the embassy will continue functioning.\n\nBelarus: Cannot tell really, it doesn't appear that Belarus issued a recent evacuation order, but relations between the two countries have been very strained, so it's hard to say what exactly is happening.\n\nSerbia: The Serbian Embassy appears to have been closed since March 2022. I could find no evidence that they recently issued new warnings for evacuation. It is not listed on the embassy website or the MFA website (which appears to be regularly updated)\n\nEgypt: Egypt appears to have ordered its remaining citizens to leave Ukraine (only a small number have not yet evacuated) after reassessing the security situation in the country as \"unstable\". Initially, Egypt announced an increased security advisory and shelter in place advisory for Egyptians in Ukraine on the 11th. They now appear to have encouraged a complete evacuation. The Embassy appears to still be open.\n\nEdit: Guess who else ordered the evacuation of citizens recently? The US on October 10th. ZOMG DID RUSSIA WARN THEM TOO? No, they cited the sudden increase in rocket attacks, just like many other countries.",

I could find no evidence that they recently issued new warnings for evacuation. It is not listed on the embassy website or the MFA website (which appears to be regularly updated)</p>\n\n<p>Egypt: Egypt appears to have ordered its remaining citizens to leave Ukraine (only a small number have not yet evacuated) after reassessing the security situation in the country as &quot;unstable&quot;. Initially, Egypt announced an increased security advisory and shelter in place advisory for Egyptians in Ukraine on the 11th. They now appear to have encouraged a complete evacuation. The Embassy appears to still be open.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Guess who else ordered the evacuation of citizens recently? The US on October 10th. ZOMG DID RUSSIA WARN THEM TOO? No, they cited the sudden increase in rocket attacks, just like many other countries.</p>\n</div>",
