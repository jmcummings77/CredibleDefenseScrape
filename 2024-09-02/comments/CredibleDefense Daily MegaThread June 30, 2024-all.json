Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

They work because Ukrainian doctrine hasn't adapted to account for them yet. Manning a machine gun position under artillery fire is generally pointless because there's nothing to shoot at anyway. Russian maneuver warfare is not well coordinated, and IFVs/tanks are functionally impervious to machine guns anyway. But as these motorcycle assaults get more common,  that calculus shifts. A reinforced machine gun position might be riskier to man under bombardment, but it can neutralize one of these assaults all by itself. I expect Ukrainians to incorporate heavily reinforced machine gun nests into their trenches, and that will crater the effectiveness of these tactics. More generally, everything is contingent on artillery. Disrupt shellfire and every single Russian assault tactic gets markedly less effective. The various shell production initiatives finally coming online should be a welcome contribution to this effort.\n\nSide note, there was an argument either here or on another forum about whether cavalry or dragoons were most analogous to these bike assaults. This article seems to come down pretty heavily on the side of dragoons, where horses/bikes are being used solely to enhance mobility and soldiers dismount before joining the battle.\n\n>The use of cheap, disposable dirt bikes and buggies helps conserve Russian armored vehicles as the Russian military resorts to drawing on stockpiles of outdated tanks dating to the Cold War.\n\nConfirmation that these assaults are an indication of the depletion of Russian stockpiles.

Don't just place it in front of the firing positions and don't adjust the layout relative to the firing positions.\n\nThe typical way to set up an overwatched obstacle is to set the obstacles about 2/3 the maximum effective range of your weapons from your firing positions. That way, when they slow down to clear the obstacles, your weapons can fire on the people trying to clear it. The obstacles can be anything from wires to dragon's teeth, Czech hedgehogs, mines, to anti-tank ditches. The weapons can be anything from rifles, MGs, ATGM, automatic grenade launchers, all the way to mortars and artillery. \n\nIt works in reverse, however. You spot an obstacle and back off about 2/3 of the way of the enemy known weapons' ranges and there should be a position somewhere. Read a map, look at the terrain and you can quite well guess where the likely positions are. No, the wires won't be right in front of the fire dugouts, but it's not hard to guess.\n\nThe problem is that modern weapons are quite lethal and an observer with a radio can call in all manners of terrible fires. You know that in that treeline, there are perhaps 6 guys there, but you need to get a shell to within 1 m of them to be effective against dug outs with overhead covers.

Russian FPVs are devasting the Ukrainian positions, according to these comments. In other words, very basic stuffs. A good machinegun position in a line expected to be shelled should not be the stereotypical open top, surrounded by sandbags, and with a machinegun. It should be a dugout with overhead cover, and with narrow but interlocking fields of fire. These are generally very difficult to destroy or suppress outside of a direct hit to the opening (and that's why the field of fire should be narrow) or right on top of the position (which should be very small and not larger than 2 x 2 m). This type of positions can be obscured with smoke rounds (the burning white phosphorous or non-burning variants, both are acceptable) to allow the assaulters to close into grenade range.\n\nSome of podcasts with Kofman stated that typically, the last 5-6km of the assault need to be on foot with the troops (including the drone operators) dragging everything with them and crawling through whatever patches of cover and concealment to reach the objective. It's very tiring and requires physical fitness. If you have the option of offloading some of that burden on a machine, why wouldn't you, as long as the vehicles can roughly use the same concealment or patch of trees that you can, as a dismount. The fact that both sides are using assaults centered around dismounts aren't necessarily a reflection of their equipment shortage (or both are facing equipment shortage).

It will be long - having delved into several points.\n\nToretsk sector. June saw the first movements in this sector this year. It all began when, around June 10, several battalions of the 24th Mech Brigade were transferred to Chasiv Yar, relieving several battalions of the 41st Mech Brigade, which were thus transferred to the Toretsk sector. This is confirmed by the posts of Kir Sazonov, a military blogger and servicemen of the 41st Mech Brigade - he personally was moved from Chasiv Yar to Toretsk and states that now his brigade defends both the sectors (probably a battalion of the 41st Brigade may have remained in the Chasiv Yar sector, and a battalion of the 24th Brigade in the Toretsk sector, but the majority of the brigades have taken each other\u2019s positions). Yesterday the Russian MoD, through the spokesman of the Group of Forces \"Centre\u201d, mentioned for the first time the 41st Mech Brigade as being deployed in the Toretsk sector.\n\nhttps://t. me/Kirilovolodimirovich/9601\n\nhttps://t. me/Kirilovolodimirovich/9604\n\nThe Russians were able to intercept these movements and understand that a rotation was underway, and they launched infantry attacks after hitting Ukrainian positions with intense artillery fire. This was despite having limited resources in this sector - according to the Ukrainian observer Mashovets, 11/12 thousand men, 50/60 tanks and 110/120 armored vehicles, although potentially now the number may increase in light of the tactical successes.\n\nThe Russians managed to advance from the former ATO \"Mayorsk\" checkpoint to the built-up area of Pivniche, where they occupied Hill 267 (just east of the town) and then seized the first houses on Kalynova and Zelena Streets. Further north they succeeded in occupying the pumping station of the Donets-Donbas Canal - where the canal no longer flows openly but gets funneled in overground pipes. Shortly thereafter they attacked from the former Penal Colony No. 57 in Horlivka towards Shumy, managing to pass the overground pipes where the Donets-Donbas Canal flows and then occupy what remains of this village, advancing further westwards through forested patches. In this area the Russians are attempting to occupy positions in the forest just east of Pivniche. In both cases they have advanced around 2,5 kms.\n\nThis week, attacking from the former cement factory in Horlivka, the Russians were able to consolidate control over some \"terrikons\" a little to the north-west and then move in the direction of Pivdenne and Zalizne; they occupied the former village entirely and had considerable success, in terms of urban penetration, in the latter small town, advancing into the built-up area for more than 1 km along Lisna Street, up to the border with the municipal area of Pivniche. \n\nA very special feature of this area is that Toretsk and Horlivka form almost a single peri-urbanized conurbation, with Pivniche as the largest town among them. From the current Russian forward positions to the beginning of the municipal area of Toretsk there is only the built-up area of Pivniche in between. We can therefore consider the urban battle in the direction of Toretsk to have begun. Before this month, the Russians had never attacked this area frontally, where Ukrainian fortifications from 2014/15 - which were, in the area affected by the advances, lost - insist. For Mashovets, a potential reason about why the Russians are deciding to try to increase the momentum of their advances is, logically, to get as close as possible to Toretsk directly, given the lack of success in closing the salient both to the north (with the Ukrainian bridgehead on the Donets-Donbas Canal south of Bakhmut still under their control) and to the south, with lack of progress towards Oleksandropil and generally along the H20 Highway. \n\nLet's give a recap of the Russian units in this sector. The main one is the 132nd Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps, which is very large having several smaller units subordinate to it. While elements of this brigade are still active further south, in the direction of Oleksandropil, others are deployed around Horlivka, and the brigade also includes the 101st and 109th Rifle Regiments of the Mobilization Reserve of the 1st Corps. Also in the area there are the 1168th and 1436th Regiments of the Territorial Forces and some separate rifle battalions of the 1st Corps; two battalions of the 110th Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps have recently arrived, according to Mashovets' reports, to keep the momentum. This sector is under the operational command of the GoF \"Centre\u201d. Further north, the 177th Separate Naval Infantry Regiment is active between Kurdyumivka and Ozarianivka (here, however, the jurisdiction belongs to the GoF \"South\"). This area is being attacked by the Russians too, but currently without success - they are also attacking the Ukrainian bridgehead on the Donets-Donbas Canal just above Mayorsk, without success. It\u2019s unclear whether there have been advances along the forest belts in the bridgehead, but along the canal the Ukrainians have a fairly solid defensive line.\n\nSome Ukrainian reinforcements have arrived. In addition to the 41st Mech Brigade which is now the main force in the area (but let\u2019s recall that it had been moved here to have a little rest after the clashes in Chasiv Yar), covering the area between Druzhba and Niu-York, elements of the 28th Mech Brigade (active mainly around Kurdyumivka) have descended to this area; the \"Safari\" Assault Regiment of the \"Lyut\" Brigade of the National Police was rushed in this area from Chasiv Yar. Apparently, that of the Russians was not a well-studied plan but they just seized the right moment to attack. The Ukrainians were caught completely by surprise by these attacks. According to Mashovets, especially in the direction of attack against Pivdnne and Zalizne, the Russians met actually very little resistance. Here there are serious responsibilities for the errors in evaluation and management of the rotation on the part of the OSG \"Khortytsia\u201d - still commanded by Sodol, who was awarding the mayor of Odesa (leaving here his [Wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gennadiy_Trukhanov)) when the mess happened in this sector. At the moment he has been removed from the Joint Forces Command and hopefully soon from the other position, which is even more important \u2013 especially considering in early 2024 this Operational-Strategic Group also took over the Pokrovsk and Kurakhove sectors from the jurisdiction of the OSG \"Tavria\". I expect that Hnatov (the new commander of the JF), highly regarded by Ukrainian observers, to replace him in the coming days as the head of the OSG too.\n\nAt the moment, the next Ukrainian defense line could be, from north to south: the area of the former \"Severnaya\" coal mine in Pivnichne - home to a terrikon that is a dominant height in the town; the high rises of Pivnichne near the border with the municipal territory of Zalizne; the terrikons between Zalizne and Pivdenne. It will all depend on how much the Russians reinforce this direction of attack and how many reinforcements the Ukrainians will be able to send. But now, as I said above, we can already talk about urban battles here. \n\nFurther south, no Russian advances towards Niu-York are recorded at all, despite some opposite Russian rumors. What\u2019s certain is that after the breakthrough the Russians began using numerous KABs in this sector and particularly against Niu-York, as stated by Kir Sazonov. The area between this Ukrainian stronghold and the H20 Highway is covered by the 109th TDF Brigade and attacked, as I wrote above, by the 132nd Motorized Brigade. There is no Russian progress at the moment, thanks to the numerous Ukrainian trenches in the area too. Second part below.",

            "body": "Pokrovsk sector. During the course of this month, a new tactical crisis for the Ukrainians has emerged in this sector. The Russians continue to attack heavily (according to official Ukrainian reports, it\u2019s the sector with the highest number of daily Russian attacks) and the Ukrainian brigades covering this sector, according to Ukrainian reports, are exhausted, as highlighted by the Ukrainian officer \"Alex\u201d.\n\nhttps://t. me/officer_alex33/3105\n\nMashovets was also expressing concerns yesterday about the defensive capabilities of the Ukrainian brigades in the area of responsibility of the GoF \u201cCentre\u201d (i.e. the Toretsk and Pokrovsk sectors). Because of that the brigades often have to fight with \"dowries\u201d, i.e. many separate rifle or TDF battalions that are attached to the main brigades in this sector and end up doing a lot of the infantry fighting. And that creates problems of communication, coordination, etc. And let's add that the command of the OTG \"Donetsk\" is far from being fully satisfactory.\n\nThere is overall a fairly urgent need for new reinforcements in this area in terms of complete, combat-ready brigades. The Russians continue to attack in strength and in multiple directions. This sector is definitely the bloodiest on the entire front for both sides. The Russians suffer tremendous losses, but they are able to make up for them with continuous arrivals of replenishments and constant use of march units. It\u2019s harder for the Ukrainians to keep up in these terms. Fighting in this sector is hell for troops on both sides. It\u2019s where the respective enemies concentrate the plurality of their resources in terms of firepower - artillery, mortars, guided bombs; the skies are constantly filled with surveillance and FPV drones, the attackers\u2019 operational tempo is very rapid.\n\nIt must be said that Russian channels do complain of arrivals of Ukrainian reinforcement and constant counterattacks. Certainly the Ukrainians are clinging to every position and forest belt and offering tenacious resistance against the Russians, as lamented by Motopatriot.\n\nhttps://t. me/motopatriot/24370\n\nhttps://t. me/motopatriot/24374\n\nIt looks like that the 31st Mech Brigade has returned to battle in this sector, presumably replacing most of the 100th Mech Brigade (elements of both the brigades are in Kharkiv Oblast, by the way). This is evidenced by the fact that Zelensky this week met with the commanders of the 110th, 47th and indeed the 31st Mech Brigade, which are defending this section of the Pokrovsk sector. It likely defends the area between Novooleksandrivka and Kalynove. In the area there are also elements of the 23rd Mech Brigade as well as several separate rifle battalions and TDF units, like one battalion each of the 112th and 129th TDF Brigades; possibly elements of the 107th TDF Brigade too, as well as the 2nd \"Galician\" Brigade of the National Guard.\n\nThe 35th Motorized Brigade of the 41st CAA is attacking towards Kalynove, achieving an advance of over 1,5 km during the first half of June, from the area of the ponds to the north-west of Arkhanhelske, occupying several forest belts. Since then the Russian advance in this direction seems to have lost momentum, partly due to the presence of several Ukrainian strongpoints before Kalynove.\n\nThe 30th Motorized Brigade of the 2nd CAA, constantly replenished with men, is active in and around Novooleksandrivka. In the same area in the recent weeks the 55th Mountain Brigade of the 41st CAA came into action (it returned to battle after it had been withdrawn during May), possibly replacing the 137th Motorized Brigade of the 41st CAA (some companies of which have been assigned to the 114th Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps). \n\nThe area between Novooleksandrivka and Yevhenivka is covered by the 110th Mech Brigade, fighting with support of TDF units and several separate rifle battalions, such as the 401st. There may be a battalion of the 95th Air Assault Brigade in the area - we will see if the rest of the brigade, currently deployed in the Lyman sector, will arrive in the future. During June the Russians managed to take the entire built-up area of the settlement; during this week they have managed to occupy almost the entire shore around the small lake formed by the course of the Bychok River, and are trying to advance along the forest belts north of the village. According to my understanding, in early June in Novooleksandrivka subunits of the 111th TDF Brigade (subordinate to the 110th Mech Brigade) withdrew to the center of the village without permission from above, unilaterally setting up a defense line there, but then being attacked by the Russians from both the east and the south, with the result that they had to abandon the village altogether. During June elements of the 1st Tank Brigade arrived in the Novooleksandrivka area in support of the other Ukrainian units.\n\nThis area is very important geographically and hydrographically. I will elaborate on this point. Just south of Avdiivka there is a tripoint where the limits of the hydrographic basins of the Kalmius (Azov Sea), Don (Azov Sea) and Dnipro (Black Sea) intersect. This is near Mineralne, in the heights between Avdiivka and Donetsk. In the area conquered by the Russians in late April north-west of Ocheretyne, i.e. the heights that have in Hill 245 their highest point (which as I had showed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/1cfxbo2/comment/l1t30od/) is the highest height in a radius of more than 20 kms), runs the watershed between the Don and Dnipro basins and numerous streams (fed mainly by precipitations) have their sources in this area, but also several very important rivers. From Andrew Perpetua's map, using OpenTopoMap as a background map, I [highlighted](https://i.imgur.com/G8kZ1PB.png) in dark blue the course of the main rivers in the area, down to the precise point of their source, and highlighted Hill 245. Obviously in their first few kms these rivers are passable on foot, but they are still an obstacle.\n\nUnderstanding hydrography is very important for understanding attack choices in the operational art. By consolidating control of this area, the Russians may have a way to advance from their sources, without the need to force rivers directly. The Vovcha rises near Prohres, later forming the main (and very important) Ukrainian defensive line down to Kurakhove. It\u2019s among the longest rivers in Ukraine and a tributary of the Samara, and consequently of the Dnipro. In Lozuvatske the Kazennyi Torets rises - a tributary of the Siversky Donets and consequently of the Don. This river passes through Kramatorsk and Sloviansk. In Novooleksandrivka the Bychok rises, which forms the Kleban-Byk Reservoir and is a tributary of the Kryvyi Torets, which flows through Kostiantynivka and then flows into the Kazennyi Torets. Just south of Novokalynove the Kalynivka rises - a small river that flows into the Bichok just before the Kleban-Byk Reservoir; the H20 Highway passes along the valley formed by this river.\n\nI think I have explained how important it is to control the hills in the Novooleksandrivka-Prohres-Ocheretyne triangle. By advancing in this area the Russians can move along both banks of the Kazennyi Torets: to the south, aiming at the western bank of the Vovcha, moving around the Ukrainian defenses along the river; to the north, aiming to the direction of Nova Poltavka and of the Highway T0504, in the area of the highway intersection, along the corridor between the Kazennyi Torets and the Bychok. Vozdvyzhenka, currently fully in Ukrainian hands, is the only village between the Russian positions and the T0504, from which it\u2019s 6,5 kms away. \n\nThe Russians have also been successful in the area of the operations of the (new) 27th Motorized Division of the 2nd CAA - the direction of Prohres, along the Avdiivka-Pokrovsk railway. Here its 433rd Motorized Regiment and several battalions of its 506th and 589th Motorized Regiments are involved. For Mashovets other battalions of these regiments have recently arrived in the immediate rear and are ready to be taken into battle. \n\nAfter fierce fighting and Ukrainian counterattacks, the Russians were able to advance a few hundred meters west of Novooleksandrivka and along the Avdiivka-Pokrovsk railway, capturing several Ukrainian strongpoints north and south of the railroad. The Russians have arrived at an important defense line (meaning they still have to take it): the one that starts from the large trenches system to the south of the small lake I mentioned above (where the Bychok flows) and reaches Yevhenivka (another line was digged a few kilometers further back, from Tymofiivka to Prohres). These lines are very important because they are the ones that allow the defense of the area between the Kazennyi Torets and the Vovcha, as there aren\u2019t obstacles placed by waterways.

The Vovcha rises near Prohres, later forming the main (and very important) Ukrainian defensive line down to Kurakhove. It\u2019s among the longest rivers in Ukraine and a tributary of the Samara, and consequently of the Dnipro. In Lozuvatske the Kazennyi Torets rises - a tributary of the Siversky Donets and consequently of the Don. This river passes through Kramatorsk and Sloviansk. In Novooleksandrivka the Bychok rises, which forms the Kleban-Byk Reservoir and is a tributary of the Kryvyi Torets, which flows through Kostiantynivka and then flows into the Kazennyi Torets. Just south of Novokalynove the Kalynivka rises - a small river that flows into the Bichok just before the Kleban-Byk Reservoir; the H20 Highway passes along the valley formed by this river.</p>\n\n<p>I think I have explained how important it is to control the hills in the Novooleksandrivka-Prohres-Ocheretyne triangle. By advancing in this area the Russians can move along both banks of the Kazennyi Torets: to the south, aiming at the western bank of the Vovcha, moving around the Ukrainian defenses along the river; to the north, aiming to the direction of Nova Poltavka and of the Highway T0504, in the area of the highway intersection, along the corridor between the Kazennyi Torets and the Bychok. Vozdvyzhenka, currently fully in Ukrainian hands, is the only village between the Russian positions and the T0504, from which it\u2019s 6,5 kms away. </p>\n\n<p>The Russians have also been successful in the area of the operations of the (new) 27th Motorized Division of the 2nd CAA - the direction of Prohres, along the Avdiivka-Pokrovsk railway. Here its 433rd Motorized Regiment and several battalions of its 506th and 589th Motorized Regiments are involved. For Mashovets other battalions of these regiments have recently arrived in the immediate rear and are ready to be taken into battle. </p>\n\n<p>After fierce fighting and Ukrainian counterattacks, the Russians were able to advance a few hundred meters west of Novooleksandrivka and along the Avdiivka-Pokrovsk railway, capturing several Ukrainian strongpoints north and south of the railroad. The Russians have arrived at an important defense line (meaning they still have to take it): the one that starts from the large trenches system to the south of the small lake I mentioned above (where the Bychok flows) and reaches Yevhenivka (another line was digged a few kilometers further back, from Tymofiivka to Prohres). These lines are very important because they are the ones that allow the defense of the area between the Kazennyi Torets and the Vovcha, as there aren\u2019t obstacles placed by waterways.

                "body": "The 15th Motorized Brigade of the 2nd CAA during this week fully captured Sokil. Firstly they had occupied the large O-shaped trench north of Sokil and then entered the village. In the last few days they have had a further advance, occupying the course of the Balka Samoilova and the eastern part of Yevhenivka; they are currently trying to penetrate the central part of this settlement. According to Russian sources, their stormtroopers had entered Voskhod, proving however unable to consolidate positions inside the village. As of yesterday, again according to Russian sources, the forest belts south of Sokil were still occupied by Ukrainian infantry and it did not appear possible for the Russians to occupy them. \n\nThe 47th Mech Brigade defends the area between Sokil and Novoselivka Persha. Several battalions each from the 142nd and 144th Infantry Brigades are attached to the 47th Brigade, as well as some battalions of the 114th and 120th TDF Brigades. The Bradleys of the 47th Brigade are very active during counterattacks. At the beginning of the month the 228th Motorized Regiment of the 90th Tank Division occupied the entire settlement of Novoprokovske, achieving, in mid-June, a further advance of about 400 meters along the Balka Ocheretyna in the direction of Novoselivka Persha. At the moment the Russians record no further progress in this direction. Elements of the 80th Tank Regiment of the 90th Tank Division are providing armored support in this area.\n\nThe 68th Jager Brigade defends the vast area of the fields and forest belts between Novoselivka Persha and the Durna River; the 420th and 423rd Separate Rifle Battalions are assigned to it. Overall, this brigade is doing a very decent job and is greatly slowing Russian progress towards Novoselivka Persha and the Vovcha. The 74th Motorized Brigade of the 41st CAA is attacking Novoselivka Persha from the south-east, advancing along the forest belts in that sort of salient where the forward Ukrainian positions were - between Novoprokovske and Umanske. This week the Russians advanced almost 2 kms westwards in this area, but it was widely expected - the Ukrainians can only slow down the Russians here, considering that given the advances in the nearby directions, the hold of the eastern bank of the Vovcha is doubtful in the medium-term.\n\nThe 114th Motorized Brigade of 1st Corps is attacking in the direction of Novoselivka Persha from the south - from Umanske, where they had gained some \u201cbridgeheads\u201d beyond the Balka Babaki. They had managed to advance further towards Novoselivka Persha but were subsequently pushed back by the 68th Jager Brigade and forced to return to their original positions. The 114th Brigade, like those of the Central MD, has recently received replenishements in the form of \u201cbatches\u201d of men from the 201st Military Base, which brigade tactical group was deployed in the Serebrianka Forest, although there is no evidence yet that all of it has been moved down here.\n\nThe area between Yasnobrodivka and the Karlivske Resorvoir is being defended by the 25th Airborne Brigade, with the support of the 78th Air Assault Regiment. The 239th Tank Regiment of the 90th Tank Division is attacking Yasnobrodivka together with the regiments of the Territorial Forces attached to the division; after managing to advance west of the Umanske-Netailove Road, the Russians have managed to enter this small settlement. Today Russian channels claimed to have occupied it entirely; I consider that possible, as its hold had become very doubtful since it was in danger of being surrounded by the Russians from the east and the south and with the Durna behind it. According to Mashovets, in the near future elements of the 80th Tank Regiment may come into action here.\n\nThe 1st Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps and the \"Somalia\" Assault Battalion of the 9th Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps (elements of which have been moved to the Kharkiv sector) are attacking Karlivka, on both sides of the southern arm of the reservoir. In the north, an Ukrainian counterattack appears to have driven the Russians out of the built-up area. In the south, according to a geolocation released today, the Russians have managed to pass the Balka Domakha and occupy houses in that area, which is defended by the 11th Motorized Battalion of the 59th Motorized Brigade. \n\nhttps://t. me/DeepStateUA/19803\n\nThis section of the front should not be overlooked \u2013 it\u2019s where the Russians are the closest to the Vovcha. The bulk of the 122nd TDF Brigade appears to have been transferred to the area near Karlivka from Kherson. Elements of the 116th TDF Brigade are also engaged here.\n\nKurakhove sector. The Russians (elements of the 110th Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps) control the southern part of Nevelske, but soldiers of Ukraine\u2019s 59th Motorized Brigade remain in the village, which proves to be a foward outpost thanks to which the Ukrainians can hold the vast area between Karlivka and Krasnohorivka. The southern bank of the Balka Domakha remains in Ukrainian hands. However, the potential loss of Nevelske could greatly complicate the situation for this entire area up to the Vovcha. \n\nFierce urban clashes continue within Krasnohorivka, which is attacked by the 5th Motorized Brigade and elements of the 110th Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps. For the Ukrainian side, over the past month the 9th Motorized Battalion of the 59th Motorized Brigade and the 153rd Battalion of the 117th TDF Brigade have arrived in the town, joining the other units here. However, the Ukrainians' goal seems to be to slow down the Russians as much as possible and \"extinguish the fires\u201d where it\u2019s doable, effectively accepting a future loss of Krasnohorivka. The Ukrainians are indeed succeeding in slowing down the Russians, but the town is a very important stronghold for the entire area around it - the Ukrainians have never sent elite units to prevent further Russian advances or attempt serious counterattacks, after the involvement of subunits of the 3rd Assault Brigade back in late February, that were able to drive out the Russian assault groups that had entered the town.\n\nSince mid-June the Russians have made several further advances in the town: they have completed the occupation of the private sector south of the brick factory; they have occupied the multi-storey buildings to the north of Kirova Street and are currently trying to advance northwards into the single-story houses; they have made progress in the \"Solnechny\" and \"Eastern\" districts (the one of the high rises), advancing north of the intersection of Radyanska Street with Heolohichna Street and capturing several high rises in the area; they are attempting to move towards the Central Hospital by attacking westwards, to the south of the Lozova River.\n\nUnits of the 150th Motorized Division of the 8th CAA have intensified offensive actions against Heorhiivka (defended by the 46th Airmobile Brigade and by a battalion of the 144th Infantry Brigade). Its 103rd Motorized Regiment operates here and over this month its 163rd Tank Regiment has become far more active too. The Russians have managed to consolidate control over the central part of Heorhiivka; there remains a Ukrainian presence in the western end. A BTR-82A, in the first half of the month, had managed to reach Maksymilyanivka but was destroyed - the village is entirely in Ukrainian hands. But let\u2019s recall that it\u2019s the last village before Kurakhove.\n\nIn Pobjeda, the situation is stable after the Russians in early June advanced more than 1 km to the south of the village. Here Ukraine\u2019s 33rd Mech Brigade is facing the 255th Motorized Regiment of the 20th Motorized Division of the 8th CAA, which operates with the support of the \"Immortal Stalingrad\" Volunteer Detachment. It\u2019s likely that in the future the Russians will close that sort of salient between Pobjeda and Paraskoviivka. From the latter village, which the Russians have entirely occupied this month, the 33rd and 242nd Motorized Regiments and the 10th Tank Regiment of the 20th Motorized Division are attacking towards Kostiantynivka, without success at the moment. The latter village is defended by the 79th Air Assault Brigade and by the 214th Special Battalion OPFOR, as well as by elements of the 116th TDF Brigade. There are Russian advances south of the Sukhi Yaly, though - yesterday they managed to occupy a trench along a tree line just before the beginning of the built-up area of Kostiantynivka. We can therefore consider the battle for this last village to have begun. \n\nFurther south, the 39th Motorized Brigade of the 68th Corps and a regimental tactical group from the 18th Machine Gun Artillery Division of the same corps are operating. After mid-June they scored an advance of about 1,5 km, approaching Kostiantynivka from the south-east as well as the Kostiantynivka-Vuhledar Road. Last part below.",

                    "body": "Vuhledar sector. Around mid-June there were serious problems in the Volodymyrivka area. As I understand it, due to the negligence of a battalion commander of the 72nd Mech Brigade. An unidentified TDF unit (I believe it to be the 234th Battalion of the 128th TDF Brigade, according to a MIA notice I found), probably subordinate to the 48th Rifle Battalions of the 72nd Brigade, ran very high risks of finding itself surrounded, as a result of a failure from the command to notify the unit that nearby positions had been lost. This problem was reported by the Ukrainian observer Bohdan Myroshnykov. The unit at risk of being surrounded was then able to withdraw, but not without losses. This happened when the Russians in mid June pushed from both the south and the east into the area near Volodymyrivka. \n\nhttps://t. me/myro_shnykov/5659\n\nhttps://t. me/myro_shnykov/5692\n\nThe 57th Motorized Brigade of the 5th CAA was brought into battle in this area during May, where the 139th Separate Assault Battalion of the 29th CAA is also active. They managed to advance almost 2 kms from the south and 2,5 kms from the east, succeeding in fully occupying the kaolin quarry north-east of Volodymyrivka, \"smoothing out\" the angle that the front forms in that area; at the same time they made progress along the Stepne-Vodiane Road, getting closer to the latter settlement. It must be said that the situation overall is under control and these are tactical gains. However, according to Mashovets, if in the future the Russians manage to improve their lines around Vuhledar by approaching it further, they could launch a large-scale offensive, headed by the formations of the Eastern MD, against the town.\n\nIn the area south of Vuhledar the situation is stable. Here, in addition to the 36th Motorized Brigade of the 29th CAA, the 95th and 116th Rifle Regiments of the 1st Corps and units of the 40th Naval Infantry Brigade are deployed. The 72nd Mech Brigade covers this area too for the Ukrainian side. \n\nVelyka Novosilka sector. The 394th Motorized Regiment and elements of the 218th Tank Regiment of the 127th Motorized Division of the 5th CAA are active in Staromaiorske, while the 60th Motorized Brigade of the 5th CAA in the forest belts to the west of the village. The 143rd Motorized Regiment and elements of the 218th Tank Regiment attack in the directions of Novodarivka and Rivnopil, without success. In both cases with the support of elements of the 34th Mountain Brigade of the 49th CAA, which had arrived here last summer as a reinforcement against the Ukrainian counteroffensive and has not been moved ever since. In the rear of this area there is also the 336th Naval Infantry Brigade, which is a kind of reserve and mainly acts through fire support to other units. This is a peculiar unit in the sense that it has never been involved in serious battles over the last 2 years - unlike the other naval infantry brigades it\u2019s really rare to find MIA notices of servicemen from this brigade. It should be mentioned that the recon battalion of this brigade during the last few months had been detached from the rest of the unit and was active in the Chasiv Yar sector.\n\nStaromaiorske is defended by the 128th TDF Brigade, elements of the 1st Tank Brigade and a grouping of the National Guard: the 21st Brigade and elements of the 11th and 17th Brigades. During June, elements of the 37th Marine Brigade arrived from Kherson, which carried out some counterattacks against forward Russian positions in the village. The Russians control the vast majority of Staromaiorske but have not been able to consolidate control over the northern part, which remains largely a grey area. DeepState criticized the command of the 1st Tank Brigade, which had responsibility over this sector, for the loss of ground west of Staromaiorske that led to the loss of the village. The Rivnopil/Novodarivka area is defended by a grouping of elements of TDF brigades (106th, 123rd, 127th, 129th). \n\nIn the eastern bank of the Mokri Yaly, the Russians continue to attack but are still unable to make serious advances in Urozhaine, although they recorded a small progress in the private sector in the southern part of the village, after having consolidated control in the farms in the southern end of the village; which is defended by the 31st Brigade of the NG, by the 58th Motorized Brigade and by elements of the Separate Presidential Brigade (3rd Mech Battalion and 20th Special Purpose Battalion). Additional elements of the 118th TDF Brigade have recently arrived around Novodonetske. Russia\u2019s 36th CAA (37th Motorized Brigade and 5th Tank Brigade), along with a battalion of the 40th Naval Infantry Brigade, is active in the eastern bank.\n\nHuliaipole sector. Nothing of note. Some \"batches\" of soldiers from the 35th CAA, which covers this sector, have recently been transferred to units of the 5th CAA to replenish their ranks. In early June DeepState corrected the map in this area, recording that to the east of Luhivske the Russian lines were around 1,5 km behind what was previously thought. Beside artillery and counter-battery fire and positional clashes, it\u2019s overall a relatively calm sector, probably the calmest \u2013 barring the state border in Chernihiv/Sumy Oblasts. It\u2019s very rare to find MIA notices of soldiers serving in this sector for both sides (on the Ukrainian side there are mainly the 108th and 102nd TDF Brigades), and it has never been decided to deploy these units in sectors in need of reinforcements. At the same time in these cases there is a positive feedback in which soldiers from a unit that is deployed for a long time in a sector with low attrition levels become very knowledgeable about the terrain and take much better care of the fortifications and of their living spaces, as they know they will have to stay there for a long time.\n\nOrikhiv sector. Attacks by the 42nd Motorized Division and the 136th Motorized Brigade of the 58th CAA continue against the area around Robotyne. The latter attacks from the south-east, the 70th and 71st Motorized Regiments from the south and the 291st Motorized Regiment of the 42nd Division from the west. At the moment the Russians are attempting to advance northwards along the forest belts to the north-east of Robotyne, in the heights of the western bank of the Balka Uspenivska. The current status of the Ukrainian strongpoints in the area of the hazel forest to the east of Robotyne is unknown.\n\nUnits of the 7th VDV Division continued to attack in the area between Verbove and Novopokrovka, from the area of Hill 143, achieving an advance of about 500 meters, towards the valley of the Balka Uspenivska (in this case the eastern bank), which could in the future threaten the hold of the Ukrainian trenches to the south-west, between Robotyne and Verbove.\n\nRussian progress is slow however, thanks to the fact that, despite the relocation of the \u201cSpartan\u201d Brigade of the NG and of the 82nd Air Assault Brigade to Kharkiv, the Ukrainian grouping is still large: counterclockwise in this sector there are the 65th Mech Brigade, 141st Infantry Brigade, 118th and 117th Mech Brigades and the \"Chervona Kalyna\" and \"Kara-Dag\" Brigades of the NG - excluding minor units.\n\nKamyanske sector. Nothing new. Positional clashes continue, but of moderate intensity. Nothing serious followed after the advance recorded by DeepState last month, confirming that it was likely a correction of the lines or at worst a localized and now resolved issue. Rather, I wonder what happened to the 49th Air Assault Brigade of the 58th CAA that had been deployed in this sector in late 2023 - there has been no news about it since the end of the last year (it was stated that the Russians were creating air assault brigades not subordinate to the VDV but to the various CAAs).\n\nKherson sector / Dnipro River. There is still a (very) limited Ukrainian presence in Krinky, in some area of the village (difficult to say where, due to lack of geolocation). The 35th and 38th Marine Brigades still operate in the area, along with the 124th TDF Brigade (which recently joined the Marine Corps, confirming rumors of recent months). Russian channels report of assaults still being carried out against Krynky without success and there are MIA notices for both sides. Units of the 104th VDV Division and the 234th Air Assault Regiment of the 76th VDV Division are involved in the attacks against Krynky and the marshy islands between the Konka and the Dnipro in that area. Most of the 76th VDV Division is likely in the rear of Kherson and Luhansk Oblasts, making it currently the most important Russian formation in reserve among the existing ones.\n\nAccording to reports from a Telegram channel run by paratroopers fighting in the area (highly critical of Teplinsky), reporting the words of relatives of soldiers from the 104th VDV Division, the losses of this formation have been very, very heavy over the course of these months - its units have been the protagonists of the attacks against the Ukrainian bridgehead since late 2023. Potential problems with cholera and intestinal infections are also reported, urging soldiers to wash their hands often and not to come into contact with the waters of the Dnipro. \n\nhttps://t. me/vdv_za_chestnost_spravedlivost/2861\n\nThe 205th Motorized Brigade of the 49th CAA, which had been withdrawn to Crimea for months, returned to action in the area around the M17 Highway. Marines of the 61st Naval Infantry Brigade continue to perform raid in the marshy islands from Bilohrudove to the mouth of the Dnipro, but with no notable successes. That's all!",
                    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Vuhledar sector. Around mid-June there were serious problems in the Volodymyrivka area. As I understand it, due to the negligence of a battalion commander of the 72nd Mech Brigade. An unidentified TDF unit (I believe it to be the 234th Battalion of the 128th TDF Brigade, according to a MIA notice I found), probably subordinate to the 48th Rifle Battalions of the 72nd Brigade, ran very high risks of finding itself surrounded, as a result of a failure from the command to notify the unit that nearby positions had been lost. This problem was reported by the Ukrainian observer Bohdan Myroshnykov. The unit at risk of being surrounded was then able to withdraw, but not without losses. This happened when the Russians in mid June pushed from both the south and the east into the area near Volodymyrivka. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a>. me/myro_shnykov/5659</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a>. me/myro_shnykov/5692</p>\n\n<p>The 57th Motorized Brigade of the 5th CAA was brought into battle in this area during May, where the 139th Separate Assault Battalion of the 29th CAA is also active. They managed to advance almost 2 kms from the south and 2,5 kms from the east, succeeding in fully occupying the kaolin quarry north-east of Volodymyrivka, &quot;smoothing out&quot; the angle that the front forms in that area; at the same time they made progress along the Stepne-Vodiane Road, getting closer to the latter settlement. It must be said that the situation overall is under control and these are tactical gains. However, according to Mashovets, if in the future the Russians manage to improve their lines around Vuhledar by approaching it further, they could launch a large-scale offensive, headed by the formations of the Eastern MD, against the town.</p>\n\n<p>In the area south of Vuhledar the situation is stable. Here, in addition to the 36th Motorized Brigade of the 29th CAA, the 95th and 116th Rifle Regiments of the 1st Corps and units of the 40th Naval Infantry Brigade are deployed. The 72nd Mech Brigade covers this area too for the Ukrainian side. </p>\n\n<p>Velyka Novosilka sector. The 394th Motorized Regiment and elements of the 218th Tank Regiment of the 127th Motorized Division of the 5th CAA are active in Staromaiorske, while the 60th Motorized Brigade of the 5th CAA in the forest belts to the west of the village. The 143rd Motorized Regiment and elements of the 218th Tank Regiment attack in the directions of Novodarivka and Rivnopil, without success. In both cases with the support of elements of the 34th Mountain Brigade of the 49th CAA, which had arrived here last summer as a reinforcement against the Ukrainian counteroffensive and has not been moved ever since. In the rear of this area there is also the 336th Naval Infantry Brigade, which is a kind of reserve and mainly acts through fire support to other units. This is a peculiar unit in the sense that it has never been involved in serious battles over the last 2 years - unlike the other naval infantry brigades it\u2019s really rare to find MIA notices of servicemen from this brigade. It should be mentioned that the recon battalion of this brigade during the last few months had been detached from the rest of the unit and was active in the Chasiv Yar sector.</p>\n\n<p>Staromaiorske is defended by the 128th TDF Brigade, elements of the 1st Tank Brigade and a grouping of the National Guard: the 21st Brigade and elements of the 11th and 17th Brigades. During June, elements of the 37th Marine Brigade arrived from Kherson, which carried out some counterattacks against forward Russian positions in the village. The Russians control the vast majority of Staromaiorske but have not been able to consolidate control over the northern part, which remains largely a grey area. DeepState criticized the command of the 1st Tank Brigade, which had responsibility over this sector, for the loss of ground west of Staromaiorske that led to the loss of the village. The Rivnopil/Novodarivka area is defended by a grouping of elements of TDF brigades (106th, 123rd, 127th, 129th). </p>\n\n<p>In the eastern bank of the Mokri Yaly, the Russians continue to attack but are still unable to make serious advances in Urozhaine, although they recorded a small progress in the private sector in the southern part of the village, after having consolidated control in the farms in the southern end of the village; which is defended by the 31st Brigade of the NG, by the 58th Motorized Brigade and by elements of the Separate Presidential Brigade (3rd Mech Battalion and 20th Special Purpose Battalion). Additional elements of the 118th TDF Brigade have recently arrived around Novodonetske. Russia\u2019s 36th CAA (37th Motorized Brigade and 5th Tank Brigade), along with a battalion of the 40th Naval Infantry Brigade, is active in the eastern bank.</p>\n\n<p>Huliaipole sector. Nothing of note. Some &quot;batches&quot; of soldiers from the 35th CAA, which covers this sector, have recently been transferred to units of the 5th CAA to replenish their ranks. In early June DeepState corrected the map in this area, recording that to the east of Luhivske the Russian lines were around 1,5 km behind what was previously thought. Beside artillery and counter-battery fire and positional clashes, it\u2019s overall a relatively calm sector, probably the calmest \u2013 barring the state border in Chernihiv/Sumy Oblasts. It\u2019s very rare to find MIA notices of soldiers serving in this sector for both sides (on the Ukrainian side there are mainly the 108th and 102nd TDF Brigades), and it has never been decided to deploy these units in sectors in need of reinforcements. At the same time in these cases there is a positive feedback in which soldiers from a unit that is deployed for a long time in a sector with low attrition levels become very knowledgeable about the terrain and take much better care of the fortifications and of their living spaces, as they know they will have to stay there for a long time.</p>\n\n<p>Orikhiv sector. Attacks by the 42nd Motorized Division and the 136th Motorized Brigade of the 58th CAA continue against the area around Robotyne. The latter attacks from the south-east, the 70th and 71st Motorized Regiments from the south and the 291st Motorized Regiment of the 42nd Division from the west. At the moment the Russians are attempting to advance northwards along the forest belts to the north-east of Robotyne, in the heights of the western bank of the Balka Uspenivska. The current status of the Ukrainian strongpoints in the area of the hazel forest to the east of Robotyne is unknown.</p>\n\n<p>Units of the 7th VDV Division continued to attack in the area between Verbove and Novopokrovka, from the area of Hill 143, achieving an advance of about 500 meters, towards the valley of the Balka Uspenivska (in this case the eastern bank), which could in the future threaten the hold of the Ukrainian trenches to the south-west, between Robotyne and Verbove.</p>\n\n<p>Russian progress is slow however, thanks to the fact that, despite the relocation of the \u201cSpartan\u201d Brigade of the NG and of the 82nd Air Assault Brigade to Kharkiv, the Ukrainian grouping is still large: counterclockwise in this sector there are the 65th Mech Brigade, 141st Infantry Brigade, 118th and 117th Mech Brigades and the &quot;Chervona Kalyna&quot; and &quot;Kara-Dag&quot; Brigades of the NG - excluding minor units.</p>\n\n<p>Kamyanske sector. Nothing new. Positional clashes continue, but of moderate intensity. Nothing serious followed after the advance recorded by DeepState last month, confirming that it was likely a correction of the lines or at worst a localized and now resolved issue. Rather, I wonder what happened to the 49th Air Assault Brigade of the 58th CAA that had been deployed in this sector in late 2023 - there has been no news about it since the end of the last year (it was stated that the Russians were creating air assault brigades not subordinate to the VDV but to the various CAAs).</p>\n\n<p>Kherson sector / Dnipro River. There is still a (very) limited Ukrainian presence in Krinky, in some area of the village (difficult to say where, due to lack of geolocation). The 35th and 38th Marine Brigades still operate in the area, along with the 124th TDF Brigade (which recently joined the Marine Corps, confirming rumors of recent months). Russian channels report of assaults still being carried out against Krynky without success and there are MIA notices for both sides.

This is where the civilian casualties are going to be taken and this is the area that\u2019s going to be flattened. It\u2019s still going to result in a mass exodus and billions of dollars of property damage alone.</p>\n</div>",

Against this background, oil companies expect the government to extend the permit for the export of gasoline, the sources of the publication note\n\nThe largest Russian oil companies have completed planned repairs and restoration of installations affected by drone attacks, and in July-August they can increase oil refining at refineries to a record 5.6\u20135.7 million barrels per day this year, Kommersant reported, citing a Kpler report. In June, the country processed 5.25 million barrels per day.\n\nLukoil has restored the primary oil refining unit at the Nizhny Novgorod refinery, damaged in the attack of a Ukrainian drone, which will increase oil refining by 120,000 bpd. Rosneft's Syzran refinery, where the AVT-6 unit, which has been idle since mid-March, was restarted, can increase processing by 125,000 b/s. Kpler also expects the restart of the Tuapse refinery with a capacity of 240,000 b/d in the near future (it was attacked in May 2024) and the commissioning of the third stage of the condensate processing complex with a capacity of 80,000 b/d in the port of Ust-Luga on the Baltic Sea. As a result, refinery utilization in July-August may increase by an additional 400,000-450,000 b/d relative to June.\"\nhttps://www.forbes dot ru/biznes/515764-vosstanovlennye-posle-atak-dronov-npz-k-koncu-leta-vyjdut-na-rekordnuu-pererabotku\n\nGasoline export was restored about a month ago, before that there was a temporary ban.\n\nFull article with more details from Kommersant:\n\"Gasoline is out of repair\nRefining volumes are preparing for records\n\nIn July and August, the largest Russian oil companies will finally have the opportunity to significantly increase refining at refineries that have resumed operation of installations damaged by attacks. Relative to June, oil refining may increase by 8.5%, to a record level of 5.6\u20135.7 million barrels per day (bpd) for this year. The most significant contribution will be provided by the restored installations at the Nizhny Novgorod and Syzran refineries, which were attacked by drones in the spring, as well as the possible restart of the Tuapse refinery. Analysts also expect NOVATEK to launch the third stage of the condensate processing complex in Ust-Luga in the near future.\n\nRussian oil refining in July\u2014August may increase to record levels this year of 5.6\u20135.7 million b/d, according to the Kpler report (Kommersant has a copy). Thus, the volume of processing in the remaining two summer months may grow by 8.5% relative to the June level of 5.25 million b/d.\n\nRussian refineries have faced a number of emergencies this year. So, at the Nizhny Novgorod refinery of LUKOIL, the compressor at the catalytic cracking plant failed at the beginning of the year. And the primary processing plants of several other major refineries suffered due to a series of drone attacks. Coupled with preventive maintenance at refineries in the spring, this did not allow the Russian oil industry to significantly increase refining during the year.\n\nSince July, oil companies have a real chance to significantly increase refining volumes.\n\nThus, LUKOIL has restored the primary oil refining unit at the Nizhny Novgorod refinery, which was damaged by the drone attack, which will increase oil refining by 120 thousand b/d. This plant accounts for about 10% of gasoline production in Russia. An increase in refining by another 125 thousand b/d can be provided by the Syzran refinery of Rosneft, which in mid-June restarted the AVT-6 unit, which has been idle since mid-March, Kpler believes.\n\nIn addition, the analytical company expects in the near future the commissioning of the third stage of the condensate processing complex with a capacity of 80 thousand b/d in the port of Ust-Luga in the Baltic Sea, as well as the restart of the Tuapse refinery with a capacity of about 240 thousand b/d. As a result, the loading of refineries in Russia in July\u2014August may increase by an additional 400-450 thousand b/d relative to the June level of 5.25 million b/d.\n\nA significant increase in oil refining, and as a result, fuel production, is a key factor for the government to extend the permit for gasoline exports. At the end of May, the government suspended until the end of June the embargo on the export of gasoline abroad, which was initially imposed from March to August. The embargo made it possible to avoid fuel shortages and a significant increase in stock prices after a series of attacks on Russian refineries in March.\n\nAccording to Kommersant's interlocutors in the oil industry, it is expected that Russian oil companies will be extended export permits, but so far no decision has been made on the timing.\n\n\"There were some problems related to the attacks. As a result of capacity utilization and rapid recovery, government actions related to the export ban, these risks were eliminated as soon as possible, and we have been working in a stable situation for several months,\" Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said in early June.\n\nNevertheless, against the background of rising demand for gasoline, the exchange price of fuel has been rising for almost the entire month of June. On Thursday, June 27, Ai-92 and Ai-95 on the SPbMTSB stock exchange rose by 1.7% and 1.4%, to 52.1 thousand rubles and 61.5 thousand rubles per ton, respectively.\nWhy is gasoline production lagging behind the plan\n\nThe fuel market expects the return of all affected capacities of the largest Russian refineries this summer, said Viktor Katona of Kpler. \"In normal times, the Nizhny Novgorod refinery produces 10% of Russian gasoline output, so the additional capacity is good news for both consumers and those who potentially want to export\",\u2014 the analyst notes.\n\nThe launch of the third condensate fractionation plant in Ust-Luga, he continues, will significantly increase the excess of naphtha on the Russian market, and NOVATEK's export capabilities will receive an additional boost. According to Mr. Katona, kerosene produced at the Ust-Luga plant is supplied to Turkey for the needs of Istanbul airport, while naphtha is exported to Asian countries.\"\nhttps://www.kommersant dot ru/doc/6792719",
