The original timeline was for the first 30 Gepards from Jordan to be delivered to Ukraine before the end of 2023 with the remaining 30 to be delivered before the end of May 2024.   \n\n\nIt's possible some of these are in better shape than the others, they were only valued at approximately $22M when they were purchased by Jordan from Dutch surplus back in 2013. We haven't really seen much since then and Jordan didn't announce any refurbishment plans or upgrade packages since then. It's possible the delay in potential final delivery end date is to accommodate some level of refurbishment as I can't imagine they're in excellent shape after several decades of relative neglect. They were originally placed in storage back around 2006 after more than a decade of running down due to the fall of the soviet union.   \n\n\nAlso worth noting that these Gepards are a different variant to the ones already in Ukrainian service, they use an X-band radar set which is relatively comparable in terms of effective range and more effective at targeting smaller objects (read drones) as it's far more sensitive than the S-band set used by the ex-Bundeswehr variant. Although this isn't without its downsides, the Dutch variant lacks a laser rangefinder and its X-band radar, whilst a lot more sensitive, is actually a double edged sword. It's prone to clutter and target acquisition and identification were historically issues, I won't pass judgement on these yet though as we have to see how the Ukrainians use them and ultimately more Gepards is better than no Gepards, especially now that the ammunition situation seems to be at long last resolved.",

These rumours both found their way to being further spread by multiple members of congress on twitter during his most recent visit. There are two commonalities with these disinfo operations:\n\n- The rumours originated from vlog-style videos of youtube channels with no other activity than this one video.\n- The video would then be 'reported' on by the website DC Weekly, hosted in Russia and founded by a US Marine now living there.\n\nThe inverted commas around reported are because this DC Weekly site - if it wasn't dodgy enough by now - has many reporters on their team, but it seems the profile pictures of each come from  stock image websites.\n\nIt's a brief overview of the case and I encourage you to read it for yourself. And with Zelensky leaving without securing the aid and the topic of corruption being so widespread recently, it has arguably been a successful disinformation campaign for Moscow. However, I'm not just writing this post to discuss this instance but the many like it.

But I'm concerned that these values are particularly vulnerable to the type of disinfo we're seeing, the lie that is halfway around the world before the truth has it's trousers on. All of this compounded by the bot networks infested in the information ecosystem of socialmedia. Like the strange online battle of Israeli vs Pakistani and UAE bots we've all seen lately.

            "body": "I've mentioned a few things on this previously -\n\nThe only real way to deal with bots in my opinion is to link real identities with online personas. Something like a national ID that you can use as a digital signature - in the vein of Estonia has done with their digital ID https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonian_identity_card. From memory South Korea has required the use of their national ID online for things like games for a few decades.

Since the Russian invasion nearly two years ago, the US imposed hundreds of sanctions on companies and individuals, but until now it had stopped short of penalizing banks and financial institutions for working with sanctioned entities.\n\n> Imposing secondary sanctions is a controversial decision because the potential impact is hard to predict and carries the risk of unintended consequences. Wary of violating rules, banks might abandon entire sectors even if they\u2019re not sanctioned. And even some allied countries consider secondary sanctions to be an overreach of US authority.\n\n> \u201cThis is a huge move, but I think Treasury\u2019s going to have to be very cautious and careful about how it uses this tool because of potential unintended consequences,\u201d said Kim Donovan, a former Treasury official now at the Atlantic Council. \u201cIf you sanction a foreign financial institution or fine a US bank for doing business with them, that can have a lot of ripple effects.\u201d\n\n> ...\n\n> \u201cAll of these companies still have to use the financial system,\u201d Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said in an interview on CNBC Friday. \u201cWhat this executive order gives us the ability to do is to target smaller institutions that may be unwilling to or wittingly trying to get around our sanctions.\u201d\n\n> ...\n\n> There\u2019s good precedent for the latest move. In the 2010s, as part of efforts to rein in Iran\u2019s nuclear program, the US imposed crippling sanctions on the country and threatened secondary sanctions against anyone who did business with it. Policymakers point to the sanctions regime as a key reason Iran\u2019s leaders eventually came to the table and agreed to limits on their nuclear ambitions in 2015.\n\n> ...\n\n> \u201cIf your goal is to really hurt Russia\u2019s economy, there\u2019s no alternative than going after it\u2019s oil revenues,\u201d said Eddie Fishman, a senior research scholar at Columbia University\u2019s Center for Global Energy Policy. \u201cAnd I still don\u2019t see the political will in the US or anywhere else to truly aggressively target Russia\u2019s oil revenues.\u201d\n\nFor the more financially literate ones here - how risky is this strategy exactly?\n\nTo my untrained eye it seems like yet another point that makes Russian financial 'strategists' earn their pay - which is a good thing - and also shifts the responsibility further down the chain - which is a good thing as well, as it makes the entire sanctions evasion more manageable since it removes the 'plausible deniability' angle, and would *mostly* hit those willingly helping Russians evade. \n\nI am severely lacking imagination in the unintended consequences department, though.",

They CANNOT be mass produced, many of the existing ones aren't very talented due to long term culture issues within the Russian Armed Forces, so the good idea are very much scarce (especially because that grade of officers took pretty heavy casualties especially in the first year of the war). Seriously attrit them, it really hurts the Russian ability to conduct successful tactical level operations, especially with any sort of finesse or ease. It's harder now than earlier in the war, they're taking fewer risks and implementing countermeasures  to protect themselves, but keeping them as a top priority target for the short kill chain weapon systems is a good idea. \n\n\n- Electronic Warfare equipment: This specifically relates to the big ticket items like [these](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krasukha), that are in limited supply and hard to replace, at least in comparison to things like tanks or IFV. Those are things their own industry will have issues replacing, and various allies can't or won't help with. \n\n\n- Engineering equipment: Specifically relating to those leading Russian mechanized attacks. Those need to be prioritized to the point they are total losses, not just damaged or disabled and later recovered. They're in more limited supply than tanks and IFV, it's already known they don't have enough already. Without them they have no hope of making armored breakthroughs. Again, that's something that Russia's allies can't or won't replace. \n\n\n- Trained and competent combat arms ground troops: This specifically relates to Spetsnaz, VDV, MP naval infantry, and anyone else that is identified by good intelligence as being effective. If they are known to be operating in an area, the UAF can send special units to find and kill them. They're very hard to replace, especially officers and what long serving NCOs remain, and even the better quality junior enlisted troops are much harder to find to replace than the typical gimps serving in the average motor rifle company. If they're gone, any offensive ops, even bite and hold attacks to take a treeline, are going to be harder. \n\n\nThere are others targets, but the above are just some I thought of that can be found and attacked without too much struggle, that would have good effects.",

Ukrainian Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) Deputy Chief Major General Vadym Skibitskyi stated on December 21 that Russian forces recruit 1,000 to 1,200 new personnel each day to replenish losses in Ukraine and send most of these new recruits immediately to the front.[68] Ukrainian officials previously reported in summer and spring 2023 that Russia was recruiting roughly 20,000 personnel through crypto-mobilization efforts per month.[69] Skibitskyi\u2019s figure suggests that Russia currently generates roughly 30,000 - 37,200 new personnel a month, a number closer to Russian officials\u2019 claims that Russia currently recruits roughly 40,000 new personnel in a month.[70] Skibitskyi stated that Russian forces are trying to maintain manpower levels for its expeditionary force in Ukraine at a level of at least 92 to 95 percent of the current deployed forces\u2018 strength so that Russian forces can maintain the tempo of their ongoing offensive operations.[71] Skibitskyi\u2018s statement suggests that Russian forces are unable to simultaneously generate large reserve forces while maintaining or increasing Russian forces\u2019 operational tempo in Ukraine. The apparent Russian force generation effort to maintain current offensive operations by offsetting high Russian casualties will likely be insufficient to fully replenish and reconstitute existing units in Ukraine if Ukrainian forces continue attriting Russian forces as they have been doing.\n\n> The Russian Federation Council approved a law on December 22 that will permit Rosgvardia to create and manage its own volunteer formations. The new law will significantly bolster Rosgvardia\u2019s force generation capacity and will likely facilitate its apparent efforts to recruit and integrate a wide array of volunteer fighters, including former Wagner Group personnel.[72] The Russian Federation Council also approved a law on criminal liability for discrediting Rosgvardia volunteer formations, indicating that Russian leadership likely intends to grant Rosgvardia volunteer formations the same status, benefits, and protections that existing volunteer formations receive.[73]\n\n> A Ukrainian military observer stated that Russian forces continue to receive assistance from Iran in establishing new capabilities for Shahed-131/136 drones. Ukrainian military observer Kostyantyn Mashovets stated on December 22 that at least 12 Russian specialists will complete training on manufacturing Shahed drones at the Iranian Pardis Technological Development Center in Tehran by the end of 2023.[74] Mashovets stated that the Iranian Air Force recently delivered up to 96 Shahed engines to Russia between December 15 and 16 and that Iran intends to send 40 Shahed launchers to Russia in the next two weeks.[75] Mashovets stated that the Russian command plans to deploy equipment for at least two additional Shahed launch sites on the territory of the 726th Air Defense Training Center in Yeysk, Krasnodar Krai, as well as in Rylsk, Kursk Oblast.[76] ISW cannot confirm Mashovets\u2019 reporting at this time, but it is consistent with an apparent intensification in Russian-Iranian cooperation over recent months[77]\n\n**Russian Technological Adaptations (Russian objective: Introduce technological innovations to optimize systems for use in Ukraine)**\n\n> The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) posted footage on December 22 purporting to show unspecified Russian Airborne (VDV) elements in an unspecified sector of the front using drones to deliver water, food, communications, and ammunition to forward Russian units on the frontline.[78] A Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces only use drones to deliver ammunition and supplies to frontline units when delivery by ground transport is not possible.[79]\n\n**Activities in Russian-occupied areas (Russian objective: Consolidate administrative control of annexed areas; forcibly integrate Ukrainian citizens into Russian sociocultural, economic, military, and governance systems)**\n\n> Kremlin-appointment Commissioner on Children's Rights Maria Lvova-Belova outlined new social support measures meant to further integrate occupied Zaporizhia Oblast into Russia during a working visit to the occupied oblast on December 22. Lvova-Belova met with Zaporizhia Oblast occupation governor Yevgeny Balitsky and discussed support for orphans and children without parental care at the Melitopol Center for Social and Psychological Rehabilitation of Children.[80] Lvova-Belova stated that her administration will provide children with \"vouchers for sanatorium and resort treatment\" as part of the \"Country for Children\" charitable foundation. \"The Country for Children\" foundation operates in occupied areas of Ukraine and is likely meant to generate dependencies on such Russian-controlled foundations for humanitarian aid, medical services, and social support.[81] The foundation also facilitates the deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia using various medical-psychiatric and sociocultural programs that bring Ukrainian children to various camps and resorts in mainly southern Russia.[82]\n\n> Russian occupation authorities are using the education system in occupied Ukraine to instill pro-Russian sentiments in Ukrainian youth. Donetsk People's Republic (DNR) head Denis Pushilin stated that over 50 youth from Donetsk Oblast took part in a discussion on the \"crimes of the Kyiv regime\" as part of the \"Mercury-2023\" youth group format.[83] Pushilin emphasized that it is \"fundamental\" that youth learn about Ukrainian \"neo-Nazism\" so it does not happen again.[84] Luhansk People's Republic (LNR) Head Leonid Pasechnik similarly stated that he participated in the first meeting of the \"Znanie\" educational organization's Luhansk Oblast branch to discuss educational programming for youth in the occupied oblast.[85] Pasechnik emphasized that it is important for children to receive education against the backdrop of the ongoing \"information war\" and Ukraine\u2018s alleged constant distortion of history. Russian occupation heads may be escalating efforts to formalize anti-Ukrainian curricula in occupied schools to accord with the Kremlin's recent escalation of rhetoric meant to strip Ukraine of its sovereignty.[86]\n\n**Russian Information Operations and Narratives**\n\n> Russian officials reiterated vague threats and complaints against Western institutions on December 22 in an attempt to discourage perceived \u201canti-Russian\" policies on the part of these institutions. Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitri Peskov stated that the admission of Ukraine to the European Union (EU) will undermine the EU and lead to its collapse in response to European Council (EC) President Charles Michel\u2019s announcement on December 14 that the EU began negotiations on Ukraine\u2019s and Moldova\u2019s accession.[87] Peskov also stated that the \u201dillegal seizure\u201d of frozen Russian assets would result in unspecified consequences and retaliatory Russian actions.[88] Peskov\u2019s comment was likely a response to recent Western reporting that the G7 may consider using frozen Russian assets to fund aid to Ukraine.[89] Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov additionally stated in an interview on December 22 that NATO is an \u201daggressive bloc\u201d aimed at weakening Russia and eliminating Russia\u2019s role as an independent world power, consistent with frequent comments by Russian officials trying to undermine the NATO alliance.[90]\n\n> Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov attempted to justify Russia\u2019s continued role in the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) on December 22 by claiming that there is no proof that Russia is destroying Ukrainian cultural heritage.[91] Kremlin-appointed Children\u2019s Rights Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova recently also denied Russia\u2019s war crimes and genocidal policies aimed at erasing Ukrainian cultural and historical identity several days before Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree further formalizing avenues for the deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia.[92] ISW continues to assess that the forced deportation and adoption of Ukrainian children likely amounts to a violation of the Convention of the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.[93]\n\n> Russian sources continued to deliberately misrepresent legitimate Ukrainian statements about mobilization on December 21 and 22 in an effort to amplify Ukrainian social tensions. Russian sources fixated on misreported comments by Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov and proposed legislation within the Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada regarding the mobilization of Ukrainian men living abroad.[94] Russian opposition outlet Radio Svoboda reported on December 22 that Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada National Security, Defense, and Intelligence Committee member Vadym Ivchenko clarified that the considered legislation will require Ukrainian men of conscription age living abroad to provide identification for their military record.[95]\n\n**Significant activity in Belarus (Russian efforts to increase its military presence in Belarus and further integrate Belarus into Russian-favorable frameworks and Wagner Group activity in Belarus)**\n\n> The Belarusian Ministry of Defense (MoD) announced on December 22 that elements of the Belarusian 38th Separate Guards Air Assault Brigade participated in combat training in an unspecified location likely in Belarus.[96]",

        "body": "In addition to DGAP, Watling, Bronk, Kofman and a few others in European defense circles, [Massicot](https://carnegieendowment.org/2023/12/18/west-s-inaction-over-ukraine-risks-dangerous-conclusions-in-moscow-pub-91290) has added her own thoughts on what the lack of aid to Ukraine would mean for the future of Europe's security architecture. Excerpts:\n\n>If the United States and EU allow funding to lapse, the consequences could threaten NATO\u2019s core mission.\n\n>Indeed, a Russia that believes it has defeated Ukraine and Western support will become increasingly emboldened and dangerous in the years to come. If Putin is convinced that Western support for Ukraine is petering out, the world will soon have to cope with a bruised, overconfident, and vengeful Russia that believes it has outlasted the will of the West. This outcome could have major consequences for NATO\u2019s core mission of deterring future Russian aggression\u2014a mission that so far has prevented the Kremlin from expanding its military adventurism beyond Ukraine\u2019s borders.\n\n>There is precedent for such behavior. Under Putin\u2019s leadership, each time the Russian government has believed that it has \u201cwon\u201d a conflict\u2014in Georgia in 2008, Ukraine in 2014, Syria in 2015, and Ukraine in 2022\u2014Putin has drawn conclusions about the United States and the West: where the redlines are, what actions they are willing to take, and the credibility of security commitments they are willing or unwilling to make. With each conflict, Russian leaders have gained confidence in their abilities and in their understanding of their enemies. Within a few years from launching one conflict, they have launched progressively bigger and bolder operations. By 2022, they felt confident enough to commit the entirety of their country\u2019s professional landpower forces to an invasion of Ukraine, at tremendous losses for themselves in what became a misjudgment of historical proportions.\n\n>The consequences of the West abandoning Kyiv will go beyond Ukraine. The risk is growing that the Kremlin could soon conclude that it has outlasted Ukraine and seen the limitations of the West\u2019s political will and appetite for supporting a protracted war. If that happens, Putin could conclude that the West\u2019s combined intelligence, military planning, weapons, tactics, and defense production will have been put to the test\u2014and failed to turn the tide of the war in the end.\n\n>If the Kremlin believes that its brute-force methods, ability to absorb staggering losses of equipment and personnel, and defense industrial base can overmatch Western assistance and political will in Ukraine, the outcome would be dangerous for NATO moving forward, and that must not be allowed to happen. It could significantly erode, if not upend, deterrence.\n\n>That would be a faulty conclusion for the Kremlin to make, because Russia is not fighting NATO. Yet the West has little control over what lessons Moscow draws from this and other conflicts. \n\n>If Russia were to snatch victory by exhausting and outlasting Ukraine and the West, Russian strategists will most likely downgrade their assessments about NATO power moving forward on the basis of political cohesion, will to fight, and defense industrial production potential. At the same time, Russian strategists and officials might raise their own scores in some areas, when considering Russian operational performance in Ukraine, despite the serious deficiencies and limitations that have been exposed throughout the war.\n\n>The most important reason to continue to fund security assistance to Ukraine is for Ukraine, which wants to live free from Kremlin subjugation and brutality. The Ukrainian Armed Forces fight hard, and they do not ask anyone to fight for them. In the past two years, they have already destroyed a majority of the pre-2022 professional Russian army.\n\n>Calls from U.S. lawmakers about a revised strategy for Ukraine and a theory of victory with resources available are valid. There are opportunities for Ukraine in 2024 to set conditions on the battlefield, continue to impose high costs on Russia, and build a military force that can deter future Russian aggression. It is in the West\u2019s interest to continue supporting Ukraine, including with an updated strategy in mind.\n\n>Russia will likely be dangerous whether it is defeated in Ukraine or not. The West cannot lose sight of the long-term security problems that Russia will pose as it recovers from the war, regenerates its military power, and\u2014quite probably\u2014seeks revenge. The West is at a critical juncture. The United States and Europe must be prepared for high-intensity warfare in a world with multiple hostile actors. Continued funding for Ukraine is a key pillar of that mission.\n\n\nAm personally skeptical of Russia's ability to meet its now clearly reiterated goals in Ukraine, let alone attack NATO, but also did not believe an invasion was likely and made any rational sense. Having said that, some thoughts. \n\nFirst, it's abundantly clear that the sane voices on the side of aiding Ukraine are about as useless as the much smaller in number but louder isolations are in trying to sabotage it. Ultimately, this issue (in the U.S.) will be horse traded on domestic policy issues as an election year looms. Second, a cynical interpretation that was mentioned (in person) was why are these fears of a future attack on the Balts (as a hypothetical) only coming to the fore now? And the answer of course is that these fears have been vocalized before the invasion, on the [first day](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-russia-estonia-race-and-ethnicity-soviet-union-187f098422b7a3170143de238865b526) of the invasion, and many times since. The better question is why are people just paying attention now? Lastly, believe too many people are going to get stuck in trying to game out where exactly Russia would strike next (if it could), which states would be able to handle a bilateral engagement without NATO support, how China/Taiwan would play into the equation, etc. Think this is probably the worst way to look at this problem. Moldova, which is not a part of NATO, could serve as the next steppingstone. It could be a million other scenarios (absorbing Belarus). It may not have anything to do with recreating the former Russian Empire/Soviet Union. It could be exactly that. The point, I believe, that Massicot and others are making is that the risk parameters for Europe would increase exponentially (and by many means they already have,) which would imply greater spending and preparation in the future relative to whatever pittance is being spent to bulk up the buffer that is Ukraine. Taiwan remains sanguine about its own security problems, as did Ukraine till it was too late. The question is at what level and timeframe will European rearmament result in enough of a deterrence if Ukraine isn't the bulwark anymore?",

If Putin is convinced that Western support for Ukraine is petering out, the world will soon have to cope with a bruised, overconfident, and vengeful Russia that believes it has outlasted the will of the West. This outcome could have major consequences for NATO\u2019s core mission of deterring future Russian aggression\u2014a mission that so far has prevented the Kremlin from expanding its military adventurism beyond Ukraine\u2019s borders.</p>\n\n<p>There is precedent for such behavior. Under Putin\u2019s leadership, each time the Russian government has believed that it has \u201cwon\u201d a conflict\u2014in Georgia in 2008, Ukraine in 2014, Syria in 2015, and Ukraine in 2022\u2014Putin has drawn conclusions about the United States and the West: where the redlines are, what actions they are willing to take, and the credibility of security commitments they are willing or unwilling to make. With each conflict, Russian leaders have gained confidence in their abilities and in their understanding of their enemies. Within a few years from launching one conflict, they have launched progressively bigger and bolder operations. By 2022, they felt confident enough to commit the entirety of their country\u2019s professional landpower forces to an invasion of Ukraine, at tremendous losses for themselves in what became a misjudgment of historical proportions.</p>\n\n<p>The consequences of the West abandoning Kyiv will go beyond Ukraine. The risk is growing that the Kremlin could soon conclude that it has outlasted Ukraine and seen the limitations of the West\u2019s political will and appetite for supporting a protracted war. If that happens, Putin could conclude that the West\u2019s combined intelligence, military planning, weapons, tactics, and defense production will have been put to the test\u2014and failed to turn the tide of the war in the end.</p>\n\n<p>If the Kremlin believes that its brute-force methods, ability to absorb staggering losses of equipment and personnel, and defense industrial base can overmatch Western assistance and political will in Ukraine, the outcome would be dangerous for NATO moving forward, and that must not be allowed to happen. It could significantly erode, if not upend, deterrence.</p>\n\n<p>That would be a faulty conclusion for the Kremlin to make, because Russia is not fighting NATO. Yet the West has little control over what lessons Moscow draws from this and other conflicts. </p>\n\n<p>If Russia were to snatch victory by exhausting and outlasting Ukraine and the West, Russian strategists will most likely downgrade their assessments about NATO power moving forward on the basis of political cohesion, will to fight, and defense industrial production potential. At the same time, Russian strategists and officials might raise their own scores in some areas, when considering Russian operational performance in Ukraine, despite the serious deficiencies and limitations that have been exposed throughout the war.</p>\n\n<p>The most important reason to continue to fund security assistance to Ukraine is for Ukraine, which wants to live free from Kremlin subjugation and brutality. The Ukrainian Armed Forces fight hard, and they do not ask anyone to fight for them. In the past two years, they have already destroyed a majority of the pre-2022 professional Russian army.</p>\n\n<p>Calls from U.S. lawmakers about a revised strategy for Ukraine and a theory of victory with resources available are valid. There are opportunities for Ukraine in 2024 to set conditions on the battlefield, continue to impose high costs on Russia, and build a military force that can deter future Russian aggression. It is in the West\u2019s interest to continue supporting Ukraine, including with an updated strategy in mind.</p>\n\n<p>Russia will likely be dangerous whether it is defeated in Ukraine or not. The West cannot lose sight of the long-term security problems that Russia will pose as it recovers from the war, regenerates its military power, and\u2014quite probably\u2014seeks revenge. The West is at a critical juncture. The United States and Europe must be prepared for high-intensity warfare in a world with multiple hostile actors. Continued funding for Ukraine is a key pillar of that mission.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Am personally skeptical of Russia&#39;s ability to meet its now clearly reiterated goals in Ukraine, let alone attack NATO, but also did not believe an invasion was likely and made any rational sense. Having said that, some thoughts. </p>\n\n<p>First, it&#39;s abundantly clear that the sane voices on the side of aiding Ukraine are about as useless as the much smaller in number but louder isolations are in trying to sabotage it. Ultimately, this issue (in the U.S.) will be horse traded on domestic policy issues as an election year looms. Second, a cynical interpretation that was mentioned (in person) was why are these fears of a future attack on the Balts (as a hypothetical) only coming to the fore now? And the answer of course is that these fears have been vocalized before the invasion, on the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-russia-estonia-race-and-ethnicity-soviet-union-187f098422b7a3170143de238865b526\">first day</a> of the invasion, and many times since. The better question is why are people just paying attention now? Lastly, believe too many people are going to get stuck in trying to game out where exactly Russia would strike next (if it could), which states would be able to handle a bilateral engagement without NATO support, how China/Taiwan would play into the equation, etc. Think this is probably the worst way to look at this problem. Moldova, which is not a part of NATO, could serve as the next steppingstone. It could be a million other scenarios (absorbing Belarus). It may not have anything to do with recreating the former Russian Empire/Soviet Union. It could be exactly that. The point, I believe, that Massicot and others are making is that the risk parameters for Europe would increase exponentially (and by many means they already have,) which would imply greater spending and preparation in the future relative to whatever pittance is being spent to bulk up the buffer that is Ukraine. Taiwan remains sanguine about its own security problems, as did Ukraine till it was too late. The question is at what level and timeframe will European rearmament result in enough of a deterrence if Ukraine isn&#39;t the bulwark anymore?</p>\n</div>",

This is actually distorting the information as compiled by ISW - there's plenty of excluded text there dealing with force generation, here's some of it, as it disagrees with your conclusion:\n\n> Skibitskyi stated that Russian forces are trying to maintain manpower levels for its expeditionary force in Ukraine at a level of at least 92 to 95 percent of the current deployed forces\u2018 strength so that Russian forces can maintain the tempo of their ongoing offensive operations.[71] Skibitskyi\u2018s statement suggests that Russian forces are unable to simultaneously generate large reserve forces while maintaining or increasing Russian forces\u2019 operational tempo in Ukraine. The apparent Russian force generation effort to maintain current offensive operations by offsetting high Russian casualties will likely be insufficient to fully replenish and reconstitute existing units in Ukraine if Ukrainian forces continue attriting Russian forces as they have been doing.\n\nMake of it what you will, but I generally find the conversation better and more fruitful when we're not cherry picking data points we like, especially with the source whose reputation you've already decided is 'tarnished'.",

This is actually distorting the information as compiled by ISW - there&#39;s plenty of excluded text there dealing with force generation, here&#39;s some of it, as it disagrees with your conclusion:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Skibitskyi stated that Russian forces are trying to maintain manpower levels for its expeditionary force in Ukraine at a level of at least 92 to 95 percent of the current deployed forces\u2018 strength so that Russian forces can maintain the tempo of their ongoing offensive operations.[71] Skibitskyi\u2018s statement suggests that Russian forces are unable to simultaneously generate large reserve forces while maintaining or increasing Russian forces\u2019 operational tempo in Ukraine. The apparent Russian force generation effort to maintain current offensive operations by offsetting high Russian casualties will likely be insufficient to fully replenish and reconstitute existing units in Ukraine if Ukrainian forces continue attriting Russian forces as they have been doing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Make of it what you will, but I generally find the conversation better and more fruitful when we&#39;re not cherry picking data points we like, especially with the source whose reputation you&#39;ve already decided is &#39;tarnished&#39;.</p>\n</div>",
