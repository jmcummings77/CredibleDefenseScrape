He also thinks Russian losses are likely much higher than Ukrainian losses on this front, but that Russian losses are probably more easily replaceable (convicts vs trained Ukrainian units).\n- Gives Russia a 50/50 chance of taking Bakhmut in the next few weeks, but said it makes little difference tactically. It's much more important how the battles have impacted both militaries. \n- Also pushed back on arguments that Ukraine shouldn't try so hard to hold Bakhmut, as he thinks the only reason this would make sense is if Ukraine had more defensible positions it could fall back to instead. \n- Kofman thinks Ukraine no longer enjoys manpower advantage after Russian mobilization.\n- Laid out 3 Western strategies to counteract Russian mobilization: 1) provide Ukraine with qualitative advantage in AFVs, 2) provide Ukraine with better combined arms training to help break Russian lines, and 3) provide Ukraine with qualitative advantage in longrange precision fires. \n- Even with Western efforts and Russia conserving ammo, he doesn't think Ukraine will ever achieve a quantitative advantage in longrange fires. \n- Kofman said that the mobiks that haven't been deployed to Ukraine yet are getting 3 months of training. Unfortunately there wasn't any elaboration on this point though, and we've heard contradictory things from him in the past saying that a lot of these troops were being held back because Russia doesn't have capacity to train so many at a time, essentially arguing that theyve been idle for months.\n- He disputed the rumor that Russia would mobilize another 500,000 troops soon, saying he thinks its unlikely they have the capacity to train or support these troops. Also said he thinks rumors of Russian invasion from Belarus are part of influence campaign trying to get Ukraine to hold back troops for an attack that will never come. \n- Thinks Spring and Summer will be pivotal moment in the war. Unlike Kharkiv and Kherson offensives, new Ukrainian offensive (most likely in Zaporizhzhia) would have a huge amount of risk associated with it as Russia would be able to launch counteroffensive of its own. Ukraine also needs to be able to prove it can keep retaking occupied territory (important for continued Western aid) and Russia needs some wins badly. \n- Thinks Gerasimov taking the reins is likely signaling that Russia is going to take a more offensive stance versus what we saw under Surovikin, which he said was seen by Kremlin as losing but more slowly and professionally. \n\nThere was quite a bit more covered, but that's what stood out to me the most. As always, highly recommended listening.",

Oryx' list of aid to Ukraine looks impressive on paper, but it's nowhere near to what I was expecting after a year.\n\n\\-  Western tanks are only being considered now despite Ukraine asking for months now. Ukrainian T-64's were already falling apart in 2014 (\"Either our tanks drive but can't shoot, or they can shoot but cannot drive\" was a common joke among UA tank crews during the Donbas war. Now imagine that quote after a year of intense combat and losses sustained). The western T-72's deliveries are awesome of course, but there are a lot of mothballed M1's sitting around in the desert doing nothing, and the US got the refurbishment line open... Hopefully the latest Ramstein meeting wasn't a total failure on the tank part. 14 Challenger 2's aren't going to do the job i'm afraid. (there was news about UA crews training on leo 2's so hopefully they can get a decent amount of them and not 40 or so if the rumor is true).\n\n\\- A lack of IFV deliveries is understandable because the only ones in large quantities are the Bradley's who thankfully are coming now, but once again after a full year of war. Why wait so long?\n\n\\- I hope artillery and mortar deliveries are limited by the number of ammunition stocks available because it's insane how after a year of war no additional towed Howitzers or mortar tubes were delivered, either newly manufactured or from old stocks.\n\n\\- Lack of Infantry Mobility Vehicles: How on earth are Ukrainian civilians still crowdfunding unarmored pick-ups for Ukrainian soldiers to get around? how hard can it be for the EU to get a fund together to buy Ukraine X amount of armored IMV's? Why is Ukraine still relying on a trickle of donated vehicles?  During the GWOT era when the US started ordering thousands of MRAP's en masse in short order, why can't we do that now?\n\nI can go on but you hopefully you get my point. I was expecting much more despite the billions announced. I'm not gonna rant about fighter jets and air defense etc because it's much more complicated, but the longer this war goes on the costlier it will be for the EU and Ukraine. A lot more could've been done in a year if the political will was really there.\n\nLately Ukrainian twitter is also starting to doompost quite a bit more, and I know it's  just twitter but still. Soldiers posting about being tired and arguing about a lack of equipment, civilians arguing about draft notices etc. I get the feeling that war weariness is starting to become a factor.\n\nThen the Russian defensive lines. Ukraine has to go on the offensive again, but another Kharkiv won't happen since the mobiks arrived, and Kherson won't happen again because Russia isn't trapped behind the Dnipro anymore. Ukraine suffered large losses in both manpower and equipment, and now they have to attempt to smash through Russian defensive lines that have been prepared for months now. I simply don't see it happening. Russia also suffered hugely in equipment and manpower,  but the mobiks are doing their job and a lot of Russian equipment is still being delivered to the front.\n\nIF Russia can go on the offensive again in the spring, on a concentrated part of the front (and not the entirety of Ukraine like last time) I don't see how Ukraine  can stop it now. They got mobiks to pin down the remaining frontline, and a large enough reserve in manpower and equipment to start an offensive on a concentrated part. I hope i'm wrong.\n\n(Also happy birthday)",

I can't imagine anyone anticipated even Wagner managing to churn through this volume of human beings so callously and so rapidly.\n\nThe most recent estimate of total remaining prisoners in the Russian prison system I can find is from [reporting by Mediazone last November](https://zona.media/article/2022/11/18/navoynu) indicating the (male) prison population had drastically fallen to approximately 325,000 after a recruiting drive of roughly 23,000 prisoners. If current recruiting estimates of 40,000-50,000 convicts are accurate, this would leave a very rough estimate of approximately 300,000 prisoners remaining.\n\nI'm not able to find demographic data on the male prison population or \"standards\" by which Wagner recruits.

I do feel confident in saying that signing up with Wagner as a convict appears to be the ultimate gamble that will almost assuredly result in either your death, your maiming, or your escape. This is speculation, but it's possible if 10's of thousands of these convicts have escaped back into Russia, this program may have colossally backfired relative to the gains Russia has made near Bakhmut (but, critically, have not even captured Bakhmut). This may have contributed to Putin's recent shunning of Prigozhin but, I emphasize, that's just speculation. \n\nOther than the wanton rape and murder of Ukrainian civilians by Russian soldiers, Russia's consistent inhumane wanton disregard for its own lowest strata of its society feels like the most ghoulish aspect of this war.",

That announcement conceding the war coincided with the Afghan Surge of 30,000 US troops over the next 18 months, which was to be immediately followed with major drawdowns, with Operation Enduring Freedom ending in 2014, replaced by a token presence of US forces doing advising, logical support, air support, etc, plus SOF and EOD support.

Some of the training takes place in the eerily quiet town of Pripyat, deserted since the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986.\n\n>As the troops are put through their paces, Lieutenant General Serhiy Naiev takes delivery of a dozen pick-up trucks armed with heavy machine guns and anti-aircraft guns, a crowd-funded initiative to help Ukraine repel Iranian-made Shahed drones, which have caused so much damage to Ukraine\u2019s power infrastructure.\n\n>But Naiev, a stocky and affable commander, believes the next phase of this war will be about tanks. And that means not his ancient T-72s but more modern machines such as German Leopard 2s and British Challengers. Ukrainian officials say they need several hundred main battle tanks \u2013 not only to defend their present positions but also to take the fight to the enemy in the coming months.\n\n>>\u201cOf course, we need a large number of Western tanks. They are much better than the Soviet models and can help us advance,\u201d Naiev said. \u201cWe are creating new military units. And our next actions will depend on their combat readiness. Therefore, Western assistance is extremely important.\u201d\n\n>Chief among their requests is the Leopard 2, which is relatively easy to maintain and operate, and in service with many NATO nations. Both the military and political leadership in Ukraine were hoping that the Ramstein meeting of Ukraine\u2019s partners on Friday would greenlight their delivery, but Germany held back.\n\n>Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov, speaking after the meeting, said he and German counterpart Boris Pistorius \u201chad a frank discussion on Leopard 2s \u2026 to be continued.\u201d\n\n>Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine\u2019s Presidential Administration, told CNN Friday: \u201cWe are disappointed. We understand that some countries have inhibitions. But the slower this goes the more of our soldiers and civilians are killed.\n\n>>\u201cIt would be significant if Germany took a leadership position here.\u201d\n\n>He contends that \u201c300 to 400 of these tanks, in fact, would outdo 2,000 to 3,000 Soviet-era tanks\u2026It would sharply accelerate the tempo of the war and initiate the closing stages.\u201d\n\n>In the meantime, Ukrainian officials say they are running out of spare parts for their existing Soviet-era tanks, even as they scour other former Soviet bloc states for supplies.\n\n>The Ukrainians fear that a second Russian offensive may begin within two months. By the spring, 150,000 Russians drafted last autumn will have been trained and probably incorporated into battle-ready units. For the Ukrainians, it\u2019s a race against time. But they are essentially converting a military based on Soviet hardware to one using advanced western weapons at warp speed.\n\n>They won\u2019t be getting M1 Abrams main battle tanks, which are powerful but difficult to maintain. Colin Kahl, the Pentagon\u2019s top policy adviser, said of the M1 that it\u2019s \u201cexpensive. It\u2019s hard to train on. It has a jet engine.\u201d\n\n>Experts also believe the German tanks could make a real difference. \u201cLeopard 2 is a modern, well-protected main battle tank with good sensors,\u201d Jack Watling, Senior Research Fellow in Land Warfare at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), told CNN.\n\n>>\u201cIt was originally designed to be maintained by conscripts and is therefore simpler to keep in the fight than some other NATO designs like the Challenger 2. There is also an existing production line to keep Leopard 2s supplied with spare parts.\u201d\n\n>But other weapons continue to flow in \u2013 Stryker armored vehicles and Bradley infantry fighting vehicles from the US, howitzers from Finland, the advanced ARCHER artillery system and anti-tank guns from Sweden.\n\n>The Ukrainian military has to train units on the new equipment and integrate it into its existing formations.\n\n>\u201cThe whole unit should be equipped with the same vehicle, so a whole battalion is equipped with Bradley, if we get it, or with Leopards,\u201d Lieutenant-General Naiev told CNN.\n\n>Several senior Ukrainian officials have said that Ukraine wants to go on the front foot before Russia reinforces its lines and its battalion tactical groups. The front lines \u2013 all the way from the Russian border in the northeast to the Black Sea \u2013 have moved little since Ukrainian advances in Kharkiv and Kherson in the autumn.\n\n>Podolyak said rapid deliveries of modern tanks would localize the war. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t spread, but remain on the occupied territories and be decided with tank warfare.\u201d\n\n>Ukraine needs tanks to clear occupied land quickly, but also longer-range missiles, Podolyak said. He expects the Russians are \u201cgoing to bring in a lot more troops, a lot of old Soviet equipment, everything, according to our estimates, that they have left.\u201d\n\n>The Russians appear to be trying to reduce the vulnerability of their ammunition stocks and troops concentrations by placing them further away from the frontlines, perhaps even beyond the range of US HIMARS systems that Ukraine has used effectively against such targets.\n\n>The list of hardware that the Ukrainians want seems ever-expanding, but Podolyak responds: \u201cOur guys aren\u2019t leaving the battlefield, even if they aren\u2019t provided with new weaponry.

Further, with Russia tied down in Ukraine, and with no further immediate threats, Sweden has less of a need for NATO than it did it in Feb 2022. This might seem shortsighted, but does anyone think Russia will be capable of pulling off a Baltic naval invasion in Sweden in the next decade, much less the current one?\n\nTurkey gets to not have yet another diplomatic spat with Russia. The two nations require very close relations to manage and maintain the Syria-to-Iran axis they both share as spheres of influence. If Turkey does agree eventually to Sweden joining, it will surely displease Moscow.\n\nNATO also gets to avoid a diplomatic bump with Russia down the line. When the peace treaty is being drafted, Sweden being in NATO will be a point of contention, no matter how unserious the contention is--don't forget, potential Ukrainian membership in NATO was one of the many reasons Russia claimed it was going to war. They may view Swedish membership in less of that light, but it would still cause concern.\n\nAnd of course: America benefits by not having to bring the Swedish Armed Forces and their various bases up to full compliance with NATO standards. The cost saved in dollars is tiny (mere billions) but in personnel is huge: we're already in a bit of a manpower crunch, what with Ukraine and the potential war in the Pacific. And like I said: the Swedish front in a potential Russian-NATO war will be secondary if not tertiary.\n\nRussia and Ukraine also both benefit. Ukraine: because NATO won't be distracted by enrolling a new nation into its ranks. And Russia: well, obviously, they will claim victory--but it is a hollow, meaningless one. They know any suicidal incursion across the Baltics would run afoul of NATO's de facto security blanket and would cause immediate war with the rest of the alliance. Still, they'll likely feel better about themselves--and in a world such as ours, sometimes that is enough.\n\nOf course, this is all to say that this is not great news, hence why I called it silver linings at the start--seeing lines of silver among a mountain of dung. It's not great that Sweden has radicals burning religious texts as if it were the 1630s again. It's not great that Turkey--our ally--is bloodthirsty for Erdogan's political dissidents. It's not great that the alliance agreed in principle to a Swedish membership and then has dawdled and failed after nearly a year.

There are a lot of multi use technologies involved in nuclear arms production; the bottleneck seems to be acquiring nuclear material in the first place, hence why I suggested that they would need to be supplied with that material. While I'm certainly no expert in counterespionage, it seems at least plausible that Taiwan might be able to have some heavily compartmentalised program without the CCP necessarily finding out about it until Taiwan told them. \n\nAs for the delivery systems issue, however, you're right; I don't see a way around that. I had assumed that Taiwan had at least some medium range ballistic missiles as part of their \"porcupine\" strategy, but I should have checked rather than assuming. \n\nI suppose that I had envisaged that Taiwan, had they possessed several units of such missiles, might conceivably spread the nuclear warheads out among them without the CCP being able to determine which units were so armed. However it seems implausible that Taiwan could produce a significant number of longer range, Iskander-like missiles capable of being armed with conventional or nuclear warheads without the CCP cottoning on to the strategy.\n\nAs to your last point, I'm not convinced that China - if the leadership knew that Taiwan had nuclear weapons and was resolved to use them to deter an invasion - would go ahead with the invasion regardless and use nuclear weapons against the island, *even if* they were confident that they could hit all the launch sites prior to Taiwan's own missiles launching. If they did so, the chance of the US refraining from using tactical nuclear weapons in the ensuing air/sea war would be absolutely zero. This would throw everyone's carefully mapped out war simulations into turmoil - and when you're fighting a tactical nuclear war between *their* ships and *your* mainland, who stands to suffer the most? - Furthermore, the reputational/economic damage suffered by China would be immense, and so on and so forth. It would obviously be the wiser choice to go on keeping the secret, to pivot away from war plans towards subversion and political interference, and to make everyone (especially your own populace) think that this was your choice and your intention, rather than something forced on you by your opponent.\n\nNot that any of that last paragraph *matters*, since I can't see a way around your point about the lack of delivery systems. \n\nThanks for your informative response.",

I had assumed that Taiwan had at least some medium range ballistic missiles as part of their &quot;porcupine&quot; strategy, but I should have checked rather than assuming. </p>\n\n<p>I suppose that I had envisaged that Taiwan, had they possessed several units of such missiles, might conceivably spread the nuclear warheads out among them without the CCP being able to determine which units were so armed. However it seems implausible that Taiwan could produce a significant number of longer range, Iskander-like missiles capable of being armed with conventional or nuclear warheads without the CCP cottoning on to the strategy.</p>\n\n<p>As to your last point, I&#39;m not convinced that China - if the leadership knew that Taiwan had nuclear weapons and was resolved to use them to deter an invasion - would go ahead with the invasion regardless and use nuclear weapons against the island, <em>even if</em> they were confident that they could hit all the launch sites prior to Taiwan&#39;s own missiles launching. If they did so, the chance of the US refraining from using tactical nuclear weapons in the ensuing air/sea war would be absolutely zero. This would throw everyone&#39;s carefully mapped out war simulations into turmoil - and when you&#39;re fighting a tactical nuclear war between <em>their</em> ships and <em>your</em> mainland, who stands to suffer the most? - Furthermore, the reputational/economic damage suffered by China would be immense, and so on and so forth. It would obviously be the wiser choice to go on keeping the secret, to pivot away from war plans towards subversion and political interference, and to make everyone (especially your own populace) think that this was your choice and your intention, rather than something forced on you by your opponent.</p>\n\n<p>Not that any of that last paragraph <em>matters</em>, since I can&#39;t see a way around your point about the lack of delivery systems. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks for your informative response.</p>\n</div>",
