FY 2023Base Procurement dollars in the amount of $58.685 million supports the procurement of 69,953 rounds.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor 2019 (page 269):\n\n>FY 2019 Total BASE dollars in the amount of $211.442 million supports the procurement of 244,402 projectiles and 15,000 recapitalized projectiles.FY 2019 Total Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding in the amount of $79.400 million supports the procurement of 59,502 projectiles.  \n>  \n>...  \n>  \n>This is a war reserve item used in combat. FY 2019 request builds a war reserve inventory in accordance with Army's procurement goals. FY 2019 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $124.476 millionsupports the procurement of 88,785 projectiles. FY 2019 OCO includes $79.400 million to support the COCOM requirement for unit equipment sets to deter potential adversaries and support the EuropeanDeterrence Initiative (EDI) of 59,502 155MM HE, M795 projectiles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn both cases we have about 70-80k rounds (in 2019 140k were training projectiles) a year of M795.\n\nThey say M107 shells are used for training (replaced by the 140k mentioned before).\n\nSo that would put the annual production at less than 100k rounds some years in total, and surely less than 100k rounds for HE shells.\n\nGoing back (2008) we can see even numbers approaching 200k for M107 shells, going down to zero as they're replace by M795. They were probably expended for training in not negligible quantities in the last decade or more.\n\nIf I'm reading this numbers well and not doing everything wrong, we could say that at best there are several hundreds of thousands of M795 shells in US inventories + M107 that could be sent to ukraine anyway even if US army doesn't use them anymore for combat.\n\nLikely, in total there were maybe few millions rounds of HE (1.5, 2.5, 3?). Certainly at the current production rate they can't be replaced fast enough. They could be replaced fast without increasing production only in the vast majority of shells sent to ukraine were M107s.\n\nObv I'm not taking into account smoke or other types of rounds, but it seems to me that while stories of \"us running out of ammo omg\" are fake, their stockpile is not bottomless.",

The FY 2023 request supports annual training and builds a war reserve inventory in accordance with the Army&#39;s procurement goals. FY 2023Base Procurement dollars in the amount of $58.685 million supports the procurement of 69,953 rounds.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>For 2019 (page 269):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>FY 2019 Total BASE dollars in the amount of $211.442 million supports the procurement of 244,402 projectiles and 15,000 recapitalized projectiles.FY 2019 Total Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding in the amount of $79.400 million supports the procurement of 59,502 projectiles.  </p>\n\n<p>...  </p>\n\n<p>This is a war reserve item used in combat. FY 2019 request builds a war reserve inventory in accordance with Army&#39;s procurement goals. FY 2019 Base procurement dollars in the amount of $124.476 millionsupports the procurement of 88,785 projectiles. FY 2019 OCO includes $79.400 million to support the COCOM requirement for unit equipment sets to deter potential adversaries and support the EuropeanDeterrence Initiative (EDI) of 59,502 155MM HE, M795 projectiles.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>In both cases we have about 70-80k rounds (in 2019 140k were training projectiles) a year of M795.</p>\n\n<p>They say M107 shells are used for training (replaced by the 140k mentioned before).</p>\n\n<p>So that would put the annual production at less than 100k rounds some years in total, and surely less than 100k rounds for HE shells.</p>\n\n<p>Going back (2008) we can see even numbers approaching 200k for M107 shells, going down to zero as they&#39;re replace by M795. They were probably expended for training in not negligible quantities in the last decade or more.</p>\n\n<p>If I&#39;m reading this numbers well and not doing everything wrong, we could say that at best there are several hundreds of thousands of M795 shells in US inventories + M107 that could be sent to ukraine anyway even if US army doesn&#39;t use them anymore for combat.</p>\n\n<p>Likely, in total there were maybe few millions rounds of HE (1.5, 2.5, 3?). Certainly at the current production rate they can&#39;t be replaced fast enough. They could be replaced fast without increasing production only in the vast majority of shells sent to ukraine were M107s.</p>\n\n<p>Obv I&#39;m not taking into account smoke or other types of rounds, but it seems to me that while stories of &quot;us running out of ammo omg&quot; are fake, their stockpile is not bottomless.</p>\n</div>",

            "body": "It's not completely clear who's done which of the shelling incidents. But obvious rationales are:\n\n* Russia is using it as a firing position or supply depot, and Ukraine is aggressive enough to shell these despite proximity to the reactor buildings.\n* Ukraine is shelling the power connections in an attempt to deny Russia use of the station's output. There've been stories about Russia disconnecting and reconnecting the grid connections, and I'm unclear on what the current state is.\n* Russians are engaging in a false flag as an attempt to spook EU/NATO politicians. As conspiracy theory as this is, after Russias absurd antics with that stupid barge it's a possibility we actually have to take seriously.\n* Some combination of the above spread across the multiple incidents.\n\nPersonally from my armchair I'm skeptical it's Ukraine shelling. It's definitely a losing move politically. In particular one of the shelling incidents appears timed to discourage the IAEA inspectors.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>It&#39;s not completely clear who&#39;s done which of the shelling incidents. But obvious rationales are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Russia is using it as a firing position or supply depot, and Ukraine is aggressive enough to shell these despite proximity to the reactor buildings.</li>\n<li>Ukraine is shelling the power connections in an attempt to deny Russia use of the station&#39;s output. There&#39;ve been stories about Russia disconnecting and reconnecting the grid connections, and I&#39;m unclear on what the current state is.</li>\n<li>Russians are engaging in a false flag as an attempt to spook EU/NATO politicians. As conspiracy theory as this is, after Russias absurd antics with that stupid barge it&#39;s a possibility we actually have to take seriously.</li>\n<li>Some combination of the above spread across the multiple incidents.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Personally from my armchair I&#39;m skeptical it&#39;s Ukraine shelling. It&#39;s definitely a losing move politically. In particular one of the shelling incidents appears timed to discourage the IAEA inspectors.

That would follow Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s recent meetings with President Joe Biden and, separately, Vice President Kamala Harris, who remains in the region. \n\n>\u201cSecretary Austin has frequently expressed the importance of keeping lines of communication open between the U.S. and China and welcomes the opportunity to meet with his PRC counterpart in Cambodia,\u201d Ryder said in a statement, adding that there was nothing formal to announce \u201cat this time.\u201d\n\n>A flurry of high-level US-China talks has helped ease pessimism about a relationship that plunged to its lowest point in a generation over issues including Taiwan, human rights in Xinjiang and US restrictions on tech exports to China. While all those issues remain intractable, the lack of communication between the two sides had fueled concerns that new disagreements or an accident could quickly spiral out of control.\n\n>Biden officials have repeatedly called for \u201cguardrails\u201d to prevent tensions between the world\u2019s two largest economies from getting out of hand. In his encounter Saturday with Harris in Bangkok, Xi emphasized his view that more communication is needed. \n\n>>**\u201cI hope both sides will step up mutual understanding, reduce misunderstanding and misjudgment, and together push for Sino-US relations to return to a healthy and stable track,\u201d** Xi said. \n\n>Austin arrives in Cambodia on Monday night for the Asean defense ministers\u2019 gathering after meeting with Indonesia\u2019s defense minister in Jakarta. The Pentagon chief is scheduled to sit down with his counterparts from the Philippines, Vietnam and Cambodia.\n\n>Wei and Austin last spoke in June in Singapore, when the bulk of the conversation between the two defense chiefs was on Taiwan. Wei condemned American moves to sell arms to the democratically-run island.\n\n>That was just before Pelosi visited Taipei, prompting China to conduct its biggest ever air and sea exercises near the island, including firing a missile that reportedly flew over Taipei.\n\n>Biden, who returned to the US Thursday after visiting Egypt and Indonesia, has said several times that US troops would defend Taiwan from an unprovoked attack.\n\n>With tensions high, U.S. officials have warned that China has become more aggressive with \u201cdangerous intercepts\u201d against American military aircraft and ships, as well as those of Japan, Canada and Australia in the South China Sea region. China claims a huge swath of the waterway, home of some of the world\u2019s busiest commercial shipping lanes.\n\n>While Xi has sought to build stronger ties with Pacific nations such as Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, his government has also charged the US with trying to build a NATO-style bloc of allies in the region. The Chinese leader warned last week that \u201cthe Asia-Pacific is no one\u2019s backyard and should not become an arena for big power contest.\u201d\n\n>Harris is continuing her travel through Southeast Asia this week, and is scheduled to visit the Philippines province of Palawan, on the edge of the South China Sea after meeting with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in Manila. **The US-Philippine relationship has been improving quickly under the new president.**  \n\n>During the meeting with Marcos, the two sides agreed to open talks on a deal for the Philippines to build nuclear power plans with American technology. Harris also reaffirmed the US\u2019s \u201cunwavering\u201d commitment to defend the Philippines in case of armed attack in the sea.\n\n>The Chinese Foreign Ministry offered a muted response Monday when asked about Harris\u2019s planned visit to Palawan. \u201cWe do not oppose the US\u2019s exchanges with regional countries, but such exchanges should be conducive to regional stability and should not harm any other country\u2019s interests,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told a regular news briefing in Beijing. \n\n>In Jakarta on Monday, **Austin praised Indonesia\u2019s government for hosting a \u201csuper\u201d version of regular military exercises with the US and 12 other nations known as Garuda Shield**. He also thanked Indonesia for voting to condemn Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine -- something Washington would like to see from India and China as well.\n\n>On Saturday, Austin warned that one consequence of the Russian war on Ukraine could be \u201ca dangerous spiral of nuclear proliferation\u201d by Russia\u2019s allies.\n\n>>\u201cPutin\u2019s fellow autocrats are watching.
