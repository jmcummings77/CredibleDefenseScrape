Russia's war aims were to drive on Kyiv from multiple directions, with several CAAs driving at the city from the North, Northeast, and Northwest, while other CAAs captured the South, and 1-2 CAAs were aiming for Dnipro with the goal of effectively encircling most of the Ukrainian army along the pre-war lines opposite of Donetsk and Luhansk.

The article makes clear that Ukraine was \"returning to Russia\" but that it would continue to exist as a state in some form or another, possibly as another \"Union State\" similar to Belarus, though it's borders would be different from it's pre-war layout. Also worth noting is that the article refers to the Ukrainians as \"little Russians\" and asserts that they (Ukrainians and Russians) are one people, which means they likely would've ratcheted up their efforts to stamp out Ukrainian identity.

            "body": "This is something I have been thinking about quite a bit recently. (**TL;DR: Yes one is coming, it will improve their position, but there will be large challenges**) For one, I believe that the Russians will conduct another mobilization sometime in the coming months. I have a hunch that they may wait to see how the American elections go, but they'll want to do it anyways. I do believe that as soon as the offensive actions in Donetsk culminate (sometime in the next two months probably) another mobilization is extremely likely.\n\nMy rationale: \n\n1. Russian units involved in offensive actions over the past 10 months have taken a lot of casualties. Following culmination, many will be rotated off the line to be rebuilt. \n\n2. The Kursk offensive has proven that Russia needs units in place that can react to Ukrainian incursions and push them out. The Russians may also consider new border adventures of their own. The recent announcement of three military groupings (Belgorod, Bryansk, Kursk) gives credence to the idea that new units will be stood up here.\n\n**What can mobilization do well?**\n\nRussian mobilization will come at a time where units exhausted by a year of constant offensive action will need to replace a lot of attrition, both due to battlefield losses as well as contracts expiring. Though monetary incentives acting as a stoploss are increasing, the fact that they are rising along with sign up bonuses indicates that the results of recruiting kontractniki may be running into problems. Meanwhile, the rising bonuses may actually be creating an perverse incentive to hold off on signing, as the longer one waits, the more money they stand to gain. A mobilization, or the mere threat of it, will likely result in many of these holdouts signing on now instead of waiting to be mobilized and seeing the contract incentives potentially disappear. The Russian military this winter will likely be in a period of reconstitution. Meaning that people will have less fear of being worthlessly thrown into assaults. This may lessen the political blow. The Russians stand to see a large boon in manpower both from another mobilization wave as well as contracts being signed.\n\n**What problems will it face?**\n\nThe Russian military this winter and into spring will likely be in a state of reconstitution. While the Ukrainians will be pressing, it is unlikely that Kursk will be repeated. At the same time, the Kursk offensive, though definitely not over, is unlikely to progress to a point where Russian cities are threatened (though that is not guaranteed). That said, Russia faces a severe bottleneck with expanding its forces, that being equipment. Over the past two and a half years, Russia has removed the vast majority of their ready equipment. The remaining stocks need to be refurbished, at increasingly expanding times, for increasingly higher prices. The mobilization of hundreds of thousands of men in the period of a few months would see largely motorized formations while troops wait for Russian repair+refurbishment depots to give them their vehicles. While BMP-3 and BTR-82 production is reported to be high and there is still plenty of artillery, there is simply not enough armor to properly equip these formations. A mobilization will struggle to create maneuver brigades, at least unless Russia decides it is willing to halt offensive actions for a significant portion of next year, or they are able to procure large amounts of armor from allies (both of these are possible!).\n\nPolitically, the Russian state does have the capital to conduct a mobilization, especially with the Kursk incursion. Indeed, Russian milbloggers were already calling for one before the attack, these calls have only become louder. However, the Russian government knows that a mobilization results in more manpower losses than just from those who are recruited. There are many millions of men who are unwilling to fight. While the Russian middle and upper class has seen a large exodus, there are many more who have stayed behind in the hopes that another draft wave would not occur. If one comes, those with wealth will know that they are not immune and many will flee. Increasingly, the mobilization will pull manpower from labor important to the economy, such as factory workers. This will hurt domestic manufacturing and lower quality of life. The Russians have tried to hold off from another mobilization for as long as possible for a reason. It is sensitive and leads to more people fleeing the country than being inducted into the military. \n\nI think that in tandem with another mobilization, the Russians will also increase efforts to find less politically impactful manpower sources, such as foreigners. The groundwork is being laid already in Africa and the Middle East to take in foreign volunteers that the Russians can essentially pay nothing, and thousands of foreigners have already fought amongst or been employed by the Russian Ground Forces.

Kursk, like the Kharkiv offensive, took advantage of Russian weakness. The Kursk offensive is also unique because of its vicinity to Ukrainian supply hubs. It can\u2019t be repeated everywhere. Though there are a few areas I do think that the Ukrainians may be able to tear off some Russian territory still.\n\nThe Russians *will* have more troops available for defense once their offensive efforts culminate and a mobilization occurs. My expectation is that happens this Autumn.\n\nThe war is approaching an interesting point. Next year is going to be very important.

Pilots must be near the FLOT to maximize the range of their drones, even with re-transmitter drones. This puts them within heavy ISR coverage and well within artillery range. \n\nOne example scenario: Electromagnetic reconnaissance locates the source of the drone control signals and then an ISR drone is tasked to investigate the location. Likely they just find a tree with an antenna stuffed in it or something similar but the drone team must be nearby. The ISR drone then loiters in the area looking for some sign of the pilots. The drone is waiting for the team to attempt to exfil or to launch another mission, both of which draws them out of the dugouts. If the drone successfully locates the pilot team it can then call in fires. Dugouts are generally resistant to all but direct hits from artillery shells but something like an Orlan 30 can guide a Krasnopol shell quite accurately if one is available. The drone can also wait for the the pilot team to attempt to exfil and catch them in the open with a strike drone or regular artillery.",

I've now had time to watch it all, and I can't pretend to be able to summarise six hours of high quality commentary but will provide some basics for anyone interested: \n\n- The premise of the video is a discussion of Australia's strategic situation in 2024 and its plans for the future out to 2040-50, explained by looking at the modern history of Australian strategic doctrine and procurement. A key document here is the Australian  Defence Force's landmark [Defence Strategic Review 2023](https://www.defence.gov.au/about/reviews-inquiries/defence-strategic-review), which marked a pivot in defence doctrine in all branches of the ADF. \n\n- H3 argues that Australia is facing a period of strategic vulnerability not seen since WWII due to the meteoric expansion of Chinese military power in the Pacific. Australia will play a key supporting role in any conflict between China and the US over Taiwan. It is far from any realistic risk of invasion, but would play host to critical (its own and US) naval, aviation and ISR assets, and would therefore be a priority target for the Chinese military in any conflict. China increasingly possesses a naval, cruise missile, and airborne strike capability capable of devastating Australia's navy, and its airforce and ISR facilities in northern Australia.  \n\n- Australian military doctrine is therefore, fundamentally, pivoting to ensure that it can prevent China's military from getting close enough to those assets to target them. \n\n- Australia's air-naval defence is currently vulnerable due to years of doctrinal focus on wars of occupation in the Middle-East. This has been greatly exacerbated by what H3 argues are profound failures in Australian naval defence procurement from 2010 onwards, most critically the abortive Arafura-class project and an entire wasted decade in Australian submarine procurement. These procurement crises have been brought to a close with new ship procurement plans and the AUKUS submarine deal. H3 strongly supports the new procurement policies but considers them far too late in coming, in that the unfit-for-purpose Arafura ships and aged Collins Class submarines will remain in service into the 2040s under the proposed timeline. The Royal Australian Navy will be profoundly vulnerable for the next 6-10 years under current models, and will then steadily build up into one of the more capable blue water navies on Earth, rivalling the French navy in hulls and capabilities by the 2040s. \n\n- The 2023 Australian Defence Strategic Review lays out what H3 considers a competent and comprehensive model to pivot the Australian Defence Force into a focused posture of Anti-Access Area Denial aimed at stifling China's influence as part of the multi-lateral US-led alliance in the Pacific. This approach assumes US leadership, naturally, and largely assume to be fighting engagements on the \"home soil\" of Australia's advanced radar and surveillance detection coverage of the Sea Air Gap stretching northwards to Indonesia. The new paradigm will focus on submarines, airpower, ISR and cruise missile capabilities to supplement the alliance and prevent China projecting naval and air power far enough south to threaten airbases and radar facilities on Australian soil. As these facilities will likely be key to any conventional war in the Pacific, they will almost certainly be a Chinese strategic target. \n\nIn summary, Australia has begun a fundamental strategic reorientation and rearmament effort to address, arguably irresponsibly too late, key vulnerabilities caused by the growing threat of Chinese power in the Pacific. H3 considers the new doctrine sound and prudent if well implemented, but judges that Australia is likely to be under-prepared for war with China for at least 10-15 years, particularly on the sea.",

Here is another dishonest statement to CNN from unnamed officials in the Biden administration: \"The US also remains reluctant to allow Ukraine to use long-range, US-provided weapons inside Kursk, multiple officials said\u2014not because of the risk of escalation, but because the US only has a limited supply of the long-range missiles, known as ATACMS, to provide to Ukraine and thinks they would be better used to continue targeting Russian-occupied Crimea, officials said.\": [https://edition.cnn.com/2024/08/15/politics/russia-has-diverted-several-thousand-troops-from-occupied-ukraine-to-counter-kursk-offensive-us-officials-say/index.html](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/08/15/politics/russia-has-diverted-several-thousand-troops-from-occupied-ukraine-to-counter-kursk-offensive-us-officials-say/index.html) . Obviously that's a lie.\n\nI can think of six explanations for why USA and in turn other Western allies will not allow the use of Western missiles in Russia (I think the main question is why the US won't allow it, as I think countries like France and the UK, though not Germany, surely would allow such strikes the moment there was a change of policy from the White House). Naturally, they are all quite speculative. Note also, that many of them are not mutually exclusive:\n\n1) They are afraid that the missiles might be so effective that it could pave the way for a Russian collapse of the front, creating a situation where Russia might be tempted to use tactical nukes. In favor of this explanation: Officials from the Biden administration have said that they believe Russia came close close to using tactical nukes after the Kharkiv counter-offensive. Against this explanation: It does not seem plausible that the missiles would have *that* large of an impact.\n\n2) They believe that Russia will only agree to peace once they have occupied the entire Donbas, and therefore don't want to slow down this process too much. In favor: It is certainly a central war goal of Russia to occupy the entire Donbas. Against: I don't believe the Biden administration would betray Ukraine like that. It is also not clear how a durable peace can be created, if Russia can interpret the result of the war as some sort of victory.\n\n3) They believe that Ukraine would use the missiles for political targets in Russia, which might create some sort of Russian escalation. Against: If USA really did not trust Ukraine to not use their ATACM's on illegitimate targets or targets they don't allow them to use them on, they would not have given Ukraine those missiles in the first place. This explanation does not make much sense, and I regard it as highly implausible.\n\n4) Russia has spies high in the political system in USA who are working against allowing the use of missiles in Russia. Against: I don't find it plausible that Russia has spies that high in the Biden administration.\n\n5) The Biden administration is afraid that Russia might take revenge against such a policy change by attempting to interfere with the Presidential election. I don't really know what to think about this one, maybe it's one of the more plausible ones, as we know Russia has previously tried to influence Western elections, but on the other hand it's quite speculative. What goes against it also is that the no-missiles in Russia policy could have been changed a long time ago, when the election was far away and that Russia might want to try to interfere with the election in any case.\n\n6) The Biden administration is afraid that the policy change might lead to immediate Russian escalation of the war as an answer. I guess the only way Russia can really escalate at this point is by using weapons of mass destruction against Ukraine or by a kinetic attack on NATO countries, so this would be what the Biden administration feared. In favor: We have seen this pattern time and time again where US officials are against crossing some perceived Russian red line but then ends up doing it slowly. This pattern might suggest that they are concerned about Russian escalation as an immediate response to their actions. The \"we're afraid of Russian escalation\"-explanation is also one of the various official \"explanations\" that the administration has given for why Ukraine can't use US missiles in Russia. Against: The Biden administration seems unusually stubborn regarding this policy change, maybe suggesting that it does not fit in with the usual 'slow boiling the frog'-pattern; of course the administration might have intelligence suggesting that this time Russia actually is dead serious about their red line, but this is also pure speculation. The strongest argument against this explanation of course is that we have seen Russia reacting in a completely toothless manner once their red lines have been crossed time and time again. At this point Ukraine has invaded Russia with US American weapons and is barraging Russia with drones every night without Russia having escalated the way the Biden administration claims it fears that Russia might do. Of course the Biden administration must be aware of this. For this reason I don't regard this explanation as particularly plausible.\n\nI understand if some of these explanations seem quite implausible, but I suppose a perplexing question will usually not have a mundane explanation. Of these 1) is the one I find most plausible (note that I have not ranked them by plausibility otherwise), but I don't really find any of them too convincing. What do you guys think? Do you have any clue why they continue this policy of not allowing Ukraine to use their missiles in Russia?",

That is what USA is doing right now: Asking Ukraine not to use ATACM's in Russia, and as a result, Ukraine is not using ATACM's in Russia.

I don't find it particularly plausible, but as I have already said, I can't really find any plausible explanation at all. What speaks against the suggestion is the following: Ukraine using missiles on military targets in Russia is certainly morally justified. Mainstream just war theory would certainly agree with this, and so long as one rejects pascifism as the correct view on war ethics, I doubt that one would really be able to find any position disagreeing that Ukrainian attacks on military targets in Russia would be justified. The Ukraine war is about a good of an example of a just war as you're going to get.

But true number is easily over 100K if you account for indirect deaths.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2024/08/middleeast/gaza-israel-hamas-battalions-invs-intl/\">https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2024/08/middleeast/gaza-israel-hamas-battalions-invs-intl/</a></p>\n</div>",

            "body": ">What do you think are the current goals in this conflict from the point of view of Putin and those close to him?\n\nThe proximal and *most important goal*, though occasionally not well-discussed, of *any* political leader starting or sustaining a war since, forever, has been to remain politically solvent, i.e. they remain in power and not suffering a coup d'\u00e9tat, especially a palace coup. In one or two interviews, Col. Lawrence Wilkerson, former CoS of Colin Powell mentioned that the greatest fear of GW Bush after 9/11 was that the American people would be so angry at his administration for letting 9/11 occurred under their watch that they would be thrown out. The administration had to start a war and they did, twice. We can point and jeer at the twin wars all we want *now*, but Bush was a two-term President. Trump started no war, \"lost\" against COVID and failed to hold China *that* much accountable, and he was not reelected. Biden \"lost\" Afghanistan and you can see his approval ratings slid down from that point. People like seeing their country win, or at least not losing, wars, including unpopular wars.\n\nSo, imagine tomorrow, Mr. Putin tells Russians that \"ooops, I made a mistake of attacking Ukraine, leading to hundreds of thousands of Russian losses and us being invaded. Sorry, my bad, let's sign a peace treaty\". That is instantly handing a reasonable cause for someone to remove him, and installing themselves as the new \"defender of Russia\". The propaganda writes itself: \"we aren't fighting Ukraine, we are actually fighting the West itself. Just like with Napoleon and the Great Patriotic War, we sometimes suffered setbacks, we were invaded, Moscow could be taken, but we would eventually win\". To avoid handing a cause for a palace coup to any conspirator, Putin only needs to continue the war, so he does. Simple as that.\n\nRemember that the zero line can be at the 1991 border (well, now both sides are taking chunks out of the other) and the war doesn't have to end. Russia could still continue launching missile attacks at Ukraine and ensure, for example, no new economic project can ever be built and no investor would invest in Ukraine. Well, Ukraine's credit rating right now is \"[pretty bad](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/sovereigns/fitch-downgrades-ukraine-to-rd-13-08-2024)\"\n\n>\u00a0instead of digging in as much as possible in hopes of freezing the conflict?\n\nA frozen conflict isn't actually preferrable to *either side*.  Ukraine's economy is, to be blunt, a basket case. It chugs on solely due to foreign aid. A frozen conflict means some of that money may evaporate but without the ability to get new investors or bond buyers (You want to invest in an economy whose electricity grid may just be destroyed tomorrow? Or a building that may just be bombed?). Zelensky is in the same boat as Putin with regards to negotiation: a negotiated end now a rightful cause for palace coup. Historically, the only reason people negotiate is that they have no capacity to fight anymore. They ran out the political will or the money to fight the war, or they started scrapping the barrels in terms of manpower. When money was gold and silver, running out of gold and silver usually meant the end to the war. With Central Banks, you can't run out of money but you do run out of wills and manpower. In a regretful way, the only way forward towards a negotiated end of the war, is for one or both sides of this war to run out of recruitable manpower or political wills and we can only get there by intensive fighting. Attrition works to end the war, if only by utterly destroying both sides.\n\nBy \"running out of recruitable manpower\", I meant it can include how it happened to the US during the Vietnam War and the US Army recruiting the \"McNamara's morons\" or Forrest Gumps. The US scrapped the barrels then (yes, that formed a chapter of a [book of that name](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x02qd)). Technically the US still had then a lot of manpower but it couldn't recruit those. You may argue that it ran out of political wills (\"Stabbed in the back by US Congress, Vietnam War edition), instead or as well, but it doesn't matter. It is feasible that Russia may reach that point some time in the future where it doesn't have enough volunteers to fight anymore and drafts just aren't possible (It hasn't been possible).\n\nNow put yourself into Zelensky's shoes. If he agrees to a negotiated end now and trade Ukraine land for an end to the war, he's out of the office in half an hour. How would he convince Ukrainians to accept a negotiated end? By asking everyone who disagree that they should negotiate and/or threaten to remove him to go forward to the front. After everyone like that is dead, they can negotiate.",

People like seeing their country win, or at least not losing, wars, including unpopular wars.</p>\n\n<p>So, imagine tomorrow, Mr. Putin tells Russians that &quot;ooops, I made a mistake of attacking Ukraine, leading to hundreds of thousands of Russian losses and us being invaded. Sorry, my bad, let&#39;s sign a peace treaty&quot;. That is instantly handing a reasonable cause for someone to remove him, and installing themselves as the new &quot;defender of Russia&quot;. The propaganda writes itself: &quot;we aren&#39;t fighting Ukraine, we are actually fighting the West itself. Just like with Napoleon and the Great Patriotic War, we sometimes suffered setbacks, we were invaded, Moscow could be taken, but we would eventually win&quot;. To avoid handing a cause for a palace coup to any conspirator, Putin only needs to continue the war, so he does. Simple as that.</p>\n\n<p>Remember that the zero line can be at the 1991 border (well, now both sides are taking chunks out of the other) and the war doesn&#39;t have to end. Russia could still continue launching missile attacks at Ukraine and ensure, for example, no new economic project can ever be built and no investor would invest in Ukraine. Well, Ukraine&#39;s credit rating right now is &quot;<a href=\"https://www.fitchratings.com/research/sovereigns/fitch-downgrades-ukraine-to-rd-13-08-2024\">pretty bad</a>&quot;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u00a0instead of digging in as much as possible in hopes of freezing the conflict?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A frozen conflict isn&#39;t actually preferrable to <em>either side</em>.  Ukraine&#39;s economy is, to be blunt, a basket case. It chugs on solely due to foreign aid. A frozen conflict means some of that money may evaporate but without the ability to get new investors or bond buyers (You want to invest in an economy whose electricity grid may just be destroyed tomorrow? Or a building that may just be bombed?). Zelensky is in the same boat as Putin with regards to negotiation: a negotiated end now a rightful cause for palace coup. Historically, the only reason people negotiate is that they have no capacity to fight anymore. They ran out the political will or the money to fight the war, or they started scrapping the barrels in terms of manpower. When money was gold and silver, running out of gold and silver usually meant the end to the war. With Central Banks, you can&#39;t run out of money but you do run out of wills and manpower. In a regretful way, the only way forward towards a negotiated end of the war, is for one or both sides of this war to run out of recruitable manpower or political wills and we can only get there by intensive fighting. Attrition works to end the war, if only by utterly destroying both sides.</p>\n\n<p>By &quot;running out of recruitable manpower&quot;, I meant it can include how it happened to the US during the Vietnam War and the US Army recruiting the &quot;McNamara&#39;s morons&quot; or Forrest Gumps. The US scrapped the barrels then (yes, that formed a chapter of a <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x02qd\">book of that name</a>). Technically the US still had then a lot of manpower but it couldn&#39;t recruit those. You may argue that it ran out of political wills (&quot;Stabbed in the back by US Congress, Vietnam War edition), instead or as well, but it doesn&#39;t matter. It is feasible that Russia may reach that point some time in the future where it doesn&#39;t have enough volunteers to fight anymore and drafts just aren&#39;t possible (It hasn&#39;t been possible).</p>\n\n<p>Now put yourself into Zelensky&#39;s shoes. If he agrees to a negotiated end now and trade Ukraine land for an end to the war, he&#39;s out of the office in half an hour. How would he convince Ukrainians to accept a negotiated end? By asking everyone who disagree that they should negotiate and/or threaten to remove him to go forward to the front. After everyone like that is dead, they can negotiate.</p>\n</div>",
