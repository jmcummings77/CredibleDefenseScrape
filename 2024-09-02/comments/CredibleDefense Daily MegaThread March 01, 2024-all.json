        "body": "A few updates on the issue of mobilization in Ukraine.\n\nThe second reading of the mobilization law [has been delayed](https://censor.net/en/news/3476214/vr_will_be_able_to_consider_draft_law_on_mobilization_not_earlier_than_second_half_of_march_peoples) due to a very high number of amendments submitted (4195!), which are going to be debated in the Defense Committee of the Verkhovna Rada. The law will come to a final vote no earlier than the second half of March.\n\nAs had been reported, the disabled Ukrainian men belonging to the third group (the lowest category) will not be mobilized, contrary to some initial rumors, but anyone who has received a disability certification of the second and the third groups since 2022 [will have to undergo a re-examination](https://censor.net/en/news/3476304/everyone_who_has_received_disability_since_2022_must_undergo_reexamination_committee_decision), to unearth the large number of those who seem to have obtained it abusively, often with the help of crooked doctors.\n\nThe issue of mobilization of convicts (on a voluntary basis) is being increasingly debated. The Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights (Ombudsman) has visited several penal colonies around the country and testified that many convicts ask to be allowed to fight. However, there is a lack of legislation for amnesty or similar measures for those who fight: this, too, will be the responsibility of parliament. As far as I have read, there are currently 26 thousand inmates inside Ukrainian jails (15 years ago there were about 150 thousand!), including 25 thousand men. For some unknown reason, however, even the former convicts who are today free are exempt from mobilization, and we are talking about dozens of thousands of men. Numerous officers are in favor, while the voice most opposed to that was Zaluzhny. In any case, despite Ukraine being in an existential war, it seems that many decisions are slowed by bureaucracy and adherence to standard procedures, unlike in Russia.\n\nWhile the decisions of the parliament are awaited, one of Syrsky's first measures as Commander-in-Chief is to get infantrymen from the roles in the rear, within the existing manpower. It has been determined that: vehicle drivers must be people with disabilities and limited physical fitness; 50% of RMZ and MPZ personnel will be placed in combat roles; and 30% of anti-aircraft defense personnel will be cut. \n\nhttps://t. me/khimikdavid4308/3146\n\nLet's give an explanation to these acts: as for drivers, it means that those who drive vehicles (don't know if that includes armored vehicles, but definitely for logistic ones) will have to be men unfit for service as infantrymen. In regards to the personnel of RMZ and MPZ, it means the moral and psychological support personnel of the UAF, made up of military men, whose equivalents in the Russian Army are those responsible for political and military work. These roles will not disappear: according to a reform proposed a few weeks ago, the system will be changed and those responsible for maintaining morale within the units will be the sergeants, while there will be involvement of civilians (I guess female psychologists) regarding psychological support. Anti-air defense personnel doesn't mean Patriot crews, but those in mobile anti-aircraft defense units, that is, those operating the heavy machine guns mounted on e.g. pickup trucks that are employed to shoot down Shaheds or other Russian drones. It's said that these positions will not be left unstaffed: either some of these units were identified as being overstaffed or the tasks will be assigned by people not suited for frontline roles. Let's recall that in January several anti-aircraft machine gun battalions [were created](https://militaryland.net/news/the-command-forms-new-air-defense-units/) under the Ground Forces, manned by personnel with disabilities or wounded veterans. So I believe that from now on, no able-bodied man will be mobilized in mobile anti-aircraft defense units, as was the case until now. For example, in January I had read the case of a 27-year-old illiterate shepherd from Transcarpathia who was mobilized and sent to a mobile anti-aircraft defense unit of the National Guard in the rear. \n\nAccording to preliminary sources, more than 10 thousand men from these categories have been identified so far and are going to become infantrymen. Within the issues regarding manpower, a separate chapter should be opened for infantry. It's the category of which there is an actual shortage of. When we read about artillerymen or ATGM operators being forced to become infantrymen by brigade commanders, it's of course a consequence of the infantrymen shortage. While these cases are relatively rare and limited to brigades that have taken a serious hit, for specialized infantry roles such as snipers and scouts it's almost becoming the norm in many units to have to become \"regular\" infantrymen and defend positions, as far as I know. In Ukraine, to attract people into the army, they often invite people to look at open positions within the brigades and go volunteer without waiting to be called to the local Territorial Recruiting Center, with no choice of either unit or specialty. This in itself is a very smart thing to do, but the downside is that it accentuates the \"skills-mismatch\" between physical fitness and the chosen specialty.\n\nExample of open positions: https://t. me/lobbyxArmy/1739\n\nFrom the interviews with officers of various Ukrainian brigades that I have read, they invite people to join their unit saying that they have open positions in numerous fields, but they emphasize that the category they really need are stormtroopers (which in Ukrainian/Russian jargon is sometimes used to define infantry in a broader sense). Today many young people volunteer to become UAV operators or artillerymen, if not for semi-civilian roles such as IT developer or for the press service, while, for example, older people volunteer to become drivers, mechanics, to work in logistics etc; whereas the positions for which there is the greatest demand and need are: rifleman, machine gunner, grenade launcher, etc. The result is that the \"niche\" positions get entirely filled and when the mobilized people show up at the TRC, almost of all them automatically become stormtroopers, even if, as is often the case, they are over 40 year-old and with some health issues. Which in turn worsens people's perception of TRCs and the fear towards mobilization. At the moment a buffer solution to find young infantrymen for the best brigades with the highest recruiting standards (except instances such as the 3rd Assault Brigade which still manage to get enough volunteers) seems to be transfers from the Territorial Defense Forces: it was reportedly ordered that their servicemen under 35 year-old will have to join the Air Assault Forces (and possibly the Ground Forces or the Marine Corps).\n\nPersonally I think that during this year the priority to curb these issues and find new infantrymen is to have courage to approve what has already been proposed: mobilization of a part of the policemen and of the personnel of the State Emergency Service (at least the younger ones), decreasing the minimum age for mobilization (at least to 25 as was already approved last year, which Zelensky never signed - certain officers are calling for it to be lowered to 22 as they are the best soldiers) and enlistment of the convicts, firstly the former ones. At the same time, and rightly so, the phenomenon of fake disabilities should be addressed (as there are plans to do) and mobilization shoud be made fairer on a territorial basis, intensifying efforts on the territories that have contributed the least. For example, I was reading a few weeks ago on the Ukrainian Twitter that there are serious problems with mobilization in the Carpathian valleys, particularly in Transcarpathia, but not only. In some communities in Kosiv Raion, only 1% of the population has been mobilized, which is half the average of the Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast (of which such raion is part), and much less than elsewhere - the best perfoming communities of the Zhytomyr Oblast reach 5%. Moreover, I have also read the issue (I don't know if that's actually the case or not), that in some of the former communities, men from other parts of Ukraine (e.g. who have relocated because of the war) are disproportionately summoned, in order to meet the mobilization target.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>A few updates on the issue of mobilization in Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>The second reading of the mobilization law <a href=\"https://censor.net/en/news/3476214/vr_will_be_able_to_consider_draft_law_on_mobilization_not_earlier_than_second_half_of_march_peoples\">has been delayed</a> due to a very high number of amendments submitted (4195!), which are going to be debated in the Defense Committee of the Verkhovna Rada. The law will come to a final vote no earlier than the second half of March.</p>\n\n<p>As had been reported, the disabled Ukrainian men belonging to the third group (the lowest category) will not be mobilized, contrary to some initial rumors, but anyone who has received a disability certification of the second and the third groups since 2022 <a href=\"https://censor.net/en/news/3476304/everyone_who_has_received_disability_since_2022_must_undergo_reexamination_committee_decision\">will have to undergo a re-examination</a>, to unearth the large number of those who seem to have obtained it abusively, often with the help of crooked doctors.</p>\n\n<p>The issue of mobilization of convicts (on a voluntary basis) is being increasingly debated. The Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights (Ombudsman) has visited several penal colonies around the country and testified that many convicts ask to be allowed to fight. However, there is a lack of legislation for amnesty or similar measures for those who fight: this, too, will be the responsibility of parliament. As far as I have read, there are currently 26 thousand inmates inside Ukrainian jails (15 years ago there were about 150 thousand!), including 25 thousand men. For some unknown reason, however, even the former convicts who are today free are exempt from mobilization, and we are talking about dozens of thousands of men. Numerous officers are in favor, while the voice most opposed to that was Zaluzhny. In any case, despite Ukraine being in an existential war, it seems that many decisions are slowed by bureaucracy and adherence to standard procedures, unlike in Russia.</p>\n\n<p>While the decisions of the parliament are awaited, one of Syrsky&#39;s first measures as Commander-in-Chief is to get infantrymen from the roles in the rear, within the existing manpower. It has been determined that: vehicle drivers must be people with disabilities and limited physical fitness; 50% of RMZ and MPZ personnel will be placed in combat roles; and 30% of anti-aircraft defense personnel will be cut. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a>. me/khimikdavid4308/3146</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s give an explanation to these acts: as for drivers, it means that those who drive vehicles (don&#39;t know if that includes armored vehicles, but definitely for logistic ones) will have to be men unfit for service as infantrymen. In regards to the personnel of RMZ and MPZ, it means the moral and psychological support personnel of the UAF, made up of military men, whose equivalents in the Russian Army are those responsible for political and military work. These roles will not disappear: according to a reform proposed a few weeks ago, the system will be changed and those responsible for maintaining morale within the units will be the sergeants, while there will be involvement of civilians (I guess female psychologists) regarding psychological support. Anti-air defense personnel doesn&#39;t mean Patriot crews, but those in mobile anti-aircraft defense units, that is, those operating the heavy machine guns mounted on e.g. pickup trucks that are employed to shoot down Shaheds or other Russian drones. It&#39;s said that these positions will not be left unstaffed: either some of these units were identified as being overstaffed or the tasks will be assigned by people not suited for frontline roles. Let&#39;s recall that in January several anti-aircraft machine gun battalions <a href=\"https://militaryland.net/news/the-command-forms-new-air-defense-units/\">were created</a> under the Ground Forces, manned by personnel with disabilities or wounded veterans.

The first P-8A for Canada is expected to deliver in 2026.*\n\n*Following the initial procurement of five P-8 aircraft in June 2021, Germany added three additional aircraft to bring the total number of P-8s for the German Navy to eight. The first aircraft will be delivered in 2025, to replace the country\u2019s fleet of P-3 Orions.*\n\n*Last year, Boeing and CAE signed teaming agreements to expand multi-mission platform collaboration in Canada, Germany and Norway. These agreements use the complementary capabilities of each company to provide superior management, technical and cost-effective training solutions for the P-8A Poseidon program.*\n\n[Poland Buys $2.5-Billion US Battle Command System | Defense Post | February 2024](https://www.thedefensepost.com/2024/02/29/poland-us-battle-command/)\n\n*Warsaw currently spends more than 4% of GDP on defense, the highest rate among NATO members.*\n\n*\u201cThe Polish army is acquiring an operational brain for air and missile defense systems,\u201d Polish Defence Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said alongside the US ambassador to Warsaw. \u201cPoland will be the second country, after the United States, to have the world\u2019s most modern integrated command system,\u201d he added.*\n\n*Poland will receive the battle command system by 2031, according to the deal.*\n\n[Raytheon, Rafael Start Tamir Missile Factory Construction in Arkansas | Defense Post | February 2024](https://www.thedefensepost.com/2024/02/27/us-tamir-missile-factory-arkansas/)\n\n*Raytheon and Rafael joint venture R2S has begun constructing a Tamir missile manufacturing facility in East Camden, Arkansas, to support US and Israeli requirements.*\n\n*The Tamir is an interceptor commonly deployed by Tel Aviv\u2019s Iron Dome Weapon System against other missiles and short-range artillery launched from 4 to 70 kilometers (2 to 43 miles) away. It is fired through a guided radar and command datalink and uses a blast warhead to neutralize threats, especially against those deployed above urban areas.*\n\n*Rafael said the hub will be built from Raytheon\u2019s existing production capacity in Highland Industrial Park. Once operational, the site is expected to create up to 60 new jobs in the state. Alongside the Tamir missiles, the R2S center will develop the US SkyHunter variant for American forces and its allied partners.*",

The first P-8A for Canada is expected to deliver in 2026.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Following the initial procurement of five P-8 aircraft in June 2021, Germany added three additional aircraft to bring the total number of P-8s for the German Navy to eight. The first aircraft will be delivered in 2025, to replace the country\u2019s fleet of P-3 Orions.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Last year, Boeing and CAE signed teaming agreements to expand multi-mission platform collaboration in Canada, Germany and Norway. These agreements use the complementary capabilities of each company to provide superior management, technical and cost-effective training solutions for the P-8A Poseidon program.</em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thedefensepost.com/2024/02/29/poland-us-battle-command/\">Poland Buys $2.5-Billion US Battle Command System | Defense Post | February 2024</a></p>\n\n<p><em>Warsaw currently spends more than 4% of GDP on defense, the highest rate among NATO members.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>\u201cThe Polish army is acquiring an operational brain for air and missile defense systems,\u201d Polish Defence Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said alongside the US ambassador to Warsaw. \u201cPoland will be the second country, after the United States, to have the world\u2019s most modern integrated command system,\u201d he added.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Poland will receive the battle command system by 2031, according to the deal.</em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thedefensepost.com/2024/02/27/us-tamir-missile-factory-arkansas/\">Raytheon, Rafael Start Tamir Missile Factory Construction in Arkansas | Defense Post | February 2024</a></p>\n\n<p><em>Raytheon and Rafael joint venture R2S has begun constructing a Tamir missile manufacturing facility in East Camden, Arkansas, to support US and Israeli requirements.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The Tamir is an interceptor commonly deployed by Tel Aviv\u2019s Iron Dome Weapon System against other missiles and short-range artillery launched from 4 to 70 kilometers (2 to 43 miles) away. It is fired through a guided radar and command datalink and uses a blast warhead to neutralize threats, especially against those deployed above urban areas.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Rafael said the hub will be built from Raytheon\u2019s existing production capacity in Highland Industrial Park. Once operational, the site is expected to create up to 60 new jobs in the state.

But the fact remains is that signing a discharge petition, for ANYTHING, is an act of insubordination to the Speaker of the House. Regardless of the bill it is attached to. So it very much stands to reason that if a Republican Representative is willing to sign a discharge petition for one particular Ukraine aid bill, he/she would be likely to sign such a petition for another bill, such as the Senate bill.  That Senate bill got 23 Republican votes in the Senate, so it can rightly be called bipartisan.\n\nIt will soon be clear that it's the Senate bill or nothing as far as Ukraine aid.

                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>Fitzpatrick&#39;s version is going nowhere.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes, I know. But the fact remains is that signing a discharge petition, for ANYTHING, is an act of insubordination to the Speaker of the House. Regardless of the bill it is attached to. So it very much stands to reason that if a Republican Representative is willing to sign a discharge petition for one particular Ukraine aid bill, he/she would be likely to sign such a petition for another bill, such as the Senate bill.  That Senate bill got 23 Republican votes in the Senate, so it can rightly be called bipartisan.</p>\n\n<p>It will soon be clear that it&#39;s the Senate bill or nothing as far as Ukraine aid. Democrats won&#39;t support anything else, and half the Republicans won&#39;t support any form of Ukraine aid. The Senate bill should get all but a few Democratic Representatives to sign a discharge petition, which means that maybe 8 Republicans is all that will be required.

Excerpts:\n\n>[How Russia war-gamed a Chinese invasion](https://www.ft.com/content/758ff1ca-6ac1-4188-9b61-c514638447b1)\n\n>>Leaked military documents lay bare Moscow\u2019s long-standing fears about Beijing\n\n>Angry mobs clashing with police in eastern cities. Networks of saboteurs smuggling arms across the border for attacks on police stations and military barracks. A resentful nuclear power boosting defence production as it accuses its neighbour of ethnic cleansing.\n\n>These all sound like Russia\u2019s playbook when it first invaded Ukraine in 2014, then launched a full-scale war in 2022. But the storylines are all from Russian military training exercises based on a hypothetical Chinese invasion of its far east.\n\n>The war games, which were written by Russian officers between 2008 and 2014 and leaked to the Financial Times, offer an extraordinary window on the army\u2019s long-standing fears about Beijing\u2019s real intentions, according to experts who reviewed the files.\n\n>As well as offering unprecedented detail on Russia\u2019s nuclear doctrine, they recount years of exercises rehearsing a possible Chinese invasion, revealing the military establishment\u2019s deep suspicion of Beijing even as leaders Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping began forging a \u201cno limits\u201d partnership.\n\n>Though the prospect of war between China and Russia may seem far-fetched today, the scenarios give granular insight into how Moscow\u2019s military thought about threats from China \u2014 as well as the tactics it deployed to wage war in Ukraine.\n\n>In one war game scenario, China pays fake protesters to clash with police in Russia\u2019s far east, then sends saboteurs to covertly attack Russian security infrastructure. Once tensions reach a boiling point, China increases defence production and ominously deploys army units at the border as it accuses Russia of \u201cgenocide\u201d.\n\n>Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center in Berlin, said Russia regularly practised such war games during the 2008-2014 period against a China that \u201cwas obviously seen as a threat\u201d.\n\n>\u201cMany new weapons systems were deployed to the far east first, even though Russia always said Nato was the main threat and China was a partner.\u201d\n\n>One document from a 2014 exercise describes relations spiralling towards conflict following the rise to power of \u201ca new generation of nationalist leaders\u201d in Dasinia, the fictional name for a country with China\u2019s precise geography.\n\n>Initially, Dasinia is said to want to deepen its ties with the Northern Federation, the alias for Russia. But the deeply cynical Dasinians seek to exploit any tensions between the North and western countries.\n\n>Soon Dasinia is demanding \u201csharp increases of raw hydrocarbon materials at extremely disadvantageous conditions\u201d from the North to power its overheated economy. Dasinia begins preparing for war after the North says no.\n\n>Some documents suggest concern that China might mount offensives via Kazakhstan \u2014 possibly leading to strikes on western Siberia and even the Urals. But in several exercises dating back as far as 2008, the invasion force\u2019s ultimate goal is to take over the Russian far east.\n\n>The plots highlight Russian fears about the Chinese diaspora within Russia, who are depicted as an explicit foreign policy tool of Beijing. The population, however, is small \u2014 with fewer than 29,000 officially recorded in the 2010 census.\n\n>One of several exercises focused on an invasion of Kazakhstan and western Siberia, dated July 2014, says China wants to find more \u201cliving space\u201d for its population there, turning the countries into \u201cresource colonies\u201d.\n\n>Michael Kofman, a senior fellow at Carnegie, cautioned that the \u201croad to war\u201d in military exercises are often \u201ccontrived, designed to test the force, and set up the exercise\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019re not necessarily reflective of what is assessed as the likeliest or most realistic threat.\u201d\n\n>Indeed in recent years Russia\u2019s military has appeared to lower its guard with China. Large-scale Vostok drills held by Moscow\u2019s forces in 2018 and 2022 in the far east included some limited Chinese participation, while Beijing has acquired some advanced Russian weaponry such as the S-400 missile defence system. The two countries held their largest joint naval and air exercise on Japan\u2019s doorstep last year.\n\n>But William Alberque, a director at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said the military co-operation had still largely been limited to \u201cphoto opportunities and parades\u201d rather than areas of particular sensitivity, such as joint operations, planning or dynamic targeting.\n\n>Experts say current Russian exercises with nuclear-capable missile systems near the Chinese border, held as recently as November, indicate the Russian military is still training for a possible conflict \u2014 one that could potentially involve tactical nuclear weapons.\n\n>Spheres of competition between Russia and China remain, particularly in Central Asia. Russia\u2019s focus on Kazakhstan in the documents indicates how Moscow saw the challenge from Beijing in Central Asia coming through military diplomacy, said Jack Watling, senior fellow at the Royal United Services Institute.\n\n>\u201cKazakh personnel were being invited to Chinese staff colleges [for military education] at a scale that began to outmatch Russia\u2019s,\u201d he said. \u201cMany traditional Russian partners in the \u2018near abroad\u2019 were having to hedge between Moscow and Beijing.\u201d\n\nThere have been arrests of senior Russian military officials and scientists involved in their hypersonic weapons program, who were charged with treason for selling secrets to China (along with to the U.S., but that's par for the course), so things aren't completely simpatico. As a digression, [Rand](https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2024/01/china-evaluates-russias-use-of-hypersonic-daggers-in.html) also published this paper recently discussing a Chinese paper discussing Russia's use of the Su-34 and Kinzhals.",

At the minimum, there is the green-blue camp divide that goes back to the martial law era regarding whether Taiwan should remain the seat for the Republic of China or establish itself as a separate and distinct entity from that.\n\nChina's position on Taiwan remains clear: \n\n- Agree with the 1992 Consensus that there is one China of which Taiwan is a part of, and that both the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China have their own different interpretation of what \"China\" means.\n\nBut domestically, Taiwan's own population views it differently. As a reminder, Taiwan's current government is a ***continuation*** of the Republic of China as established by Sun Yat-Sen, and there has been zero legal action to dissolve that polity within Taiwan.\n\nHowever, under successive pan-green governments--first under Chen (2000-2008), and much more aggressively under Tsai in the last 8 years (2016-2024)--Taiwan has been conducting their own version of \"salami slicing\" towards dissolving their status as the Republic of China.\n\nNoteworthy instances:\n\n- 2016: In Tsai's inauguration speech, Tsai [cast questions on the 1992 consensus](https://english.president.gov.tw/News/4893), arguing that breaking with her predecessors, including Chen, who acknowledged it. In response, [China suspended diplomatic contact with Taiwan](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/26/world/asia/china-suspends-diplomatic-contact-with-taiwan.html), claiming that it was because Taiwan did not recognize the 1992 consensus.\n- 2019: Tsai [explicitly rejects the 1992 Consensus](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/05/world/asia/taiwan-xi-jinping-tsai-ing-wen.html). This has since become an official DPP policy, with her successor (and then VP) Lai Ching-te saying the same during his presidential bid.\n- 2020: [Officially dropped the word \"China\" from the English passport cover](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN25T0J9/) but still retains Republic of China in Chinese.\n- 2020: began publishing ADIZ incursion data\n- 2023: [Removed ROC state emblem and name from National Day celebration](https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2023/10/05/2003807239)\n- 2023: Taiwan moves to [reduce classical Chinese from school curriculum](https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2023/12/10/2003810422)\n\n[I've written about how the DPP has moved to redefine the status quo](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/1b1ba4b/credibledefense_daily_megathread_february_27_2024/ksfewzv/), which gives them more latitude to act in a way that technically bucks the status quo while claiming that they are abiding by it.\n\nIt's vitally important that we recognize Taiwan *has* agency in acting to raise or lower the temperature in cross-strait relations. \n\nFor example, under the Ma administration between 2008 and 2016, relations between China and Taiwan reached its zenith - with free travel and trade being the primary drivers of cultural and social exchanges. \n\nThe Ma administration also overlaps with the first four years of the Xi administration, maintaining friendly relations even as Xi launched his wide-reaching corruption trials that targeted prominent CCP rivals like Bo Xilai.\n\nIt wouldn't be until the election of Tsai, who campaigned on the local issue of Taiwan sovereignty and rejecting further socioeconomic integration with the mainland, that saw the deterioration of relations between China and Taiwan.\n\n------\n\nWith that said, here is my disagreement with Ben's claims:\n\n> Taiwan\u2019s response has been inconsistent and lacks transparency, which may further embolden Beijing. \n\nThe above context indicates that Taiwan's response has not only been consistent, but it is nakedly transparent: the eventual goal by the DPP pan-green coalition, who seem to be in a position that they cannot be dislodged by the KMT's pan-blue coalition, is to slowly chip away at the *identity* of Taiwan as the Republic of China until a Republic of Taiwan is officially established in all but name.\n\nAgain, as Ben himself notes in the article: China didn't start this military pressure *until* Tsai began to seriously pursue that stated aim by first rejecting the 1992 Consensus.\n\n> China has tested Taiwan\u2019s policy by sending at least 27 balloons into the island\u2019s territorial airspace since the start of this year\n\nGiven the weather patterns in the Taiwan Strait, it's not uncommon for weather balloons to be sent up in order to collect data in the region. And a Newsweek article [clarifies that those balloons are weather balloons](https://www.newsweek.com/china-taiwan-weather-balloon-map-airspace-violation-political-military-pressure-1864165).\n\nTaiwan also did not publish any data about balloon overflight until after the balloon incident took place over the US. But in the format of MOD ADIZ incursion releases under Tsai, balloons flying OVER the island look a lot more threatening than aircrafts flying around it. *It is my opinion* that this was a deliberate choice by Taipei to play up the threat to what is otherwise a fairly mundane activity.\n\n> Voters in Taiwan made their desires clear last month when they chose Lai Ching-te, who is committed to the island\u2019s sovereignty, as their next president. \n\nLai--a self branded political worker for Taiwan independence--received only 40% of the votes, and most critically, he received only 63,900 more votes than the KMT candidate Han Kuo-yu in 2020 against a VERY popular Tsai. [Official polls within Taiwan](https://esc.nccu.edu.tw/eng/PageDoc?fid=7801) show that the majority position is maintain the status quo (however vaguely defined) indefinitely.\n\nIn other words, 60% of the voters chose to vote AGAINST Lai. His victory was more opportunistic than an actual majority mandate. \n\nLai's rule is also frustrated by the fact that the DPP continues to lose seats in the Legislative Yuan, which makes it MUCH harder for Lai to enact any policies the DPP wants to put forth AND satisfy the deep green pro-independence side of the Pan-Green alliance.\n\n> The United States must make clear to China that its military activities could spark a war and are no longer acceptable. Washington should also coordinate with Taipei on more effective ways to deter Chinese provocations, such as through increased information sharing, air patrol exercises and ensuring that the island is fully equipped and prepared to defend its sovereignty.\n\nDeterring a cross-strait war is a full spectrum effort encompassing economic, political, *and* military aspects. The proposed increase in military capabilities for Taiwan serves as an impetus for the PRC to increase their own military capabilities in order to deter Taiwan seeking de jure independence from the ROC.\n\nAnd this is what I mean when I say that this article ignores Taiwan's own agency in the issue. The last 8 years alone has seen a deterioration of cross-strait relations driven by a cycle of action-reaction from Taipei to Beijing, with Taipei often firing the first shot. But the article makes it seem as if China is the only one acting against the status quo while Taiwan does nothing.\n\nTaipei feels encouraged to make these decisions *because* they believe that US policy towards Taiwan has changed from Strategic Ambiguity to Strategic Clarity. \n\nDuring the Cold War and even after Chiang Kai-shek's death, we deliberately made it difficult for Taipei to ascertain whether we'd intervene if *they* were the ones to act first by pursuing de jure Taiwanese independence.\n\n**This policy is what has largely kept Taiwan from pursuing actions that can be *interpreted* by China as salami slicing towards independence.**\n\nBut the last 8 years have seen us gravitate towards the idea that we will intervene no matter what Taiwan does. Under this particular mindset, Taiwanese politicians--especially pro-independence DPP ones--feel MUCH more emboldened to enact policies that would have antagonized China in prior years, even as the PLA of today grows more modernized, gains deeper familiarity with their new equipment, and becomes a pacing threat to American military dominance.",

In the worst case you could see macroeconomic struggles, but even below this level you could imagine that eg. the Chinese drone industry would be hurt badly if sanctions bit into it in a real way. The CCP could subsidize these losses for sure, but then thats just another thing they have to prop up in a currently weak economy.</p>\n</div>",

Firms panicked by worsening relations across the Pacific are pursuing \u201cChina plus one\u201d strategies, keeping some production in the world\u2019s second-largest economy, while moving the rest to countries, such as Vietnam, that are friendlier to Uncle Sam. Yet American demand for final products from allies also boosts demand for Chinese intermediate inputs, and produces incentives for Chinese firms to operate and export from alternative places. Although Apple, the world\u2019s largest company by market capitalisation, has moved production outside China in recent years, this comes with a caveat: much of the production still relies on Chinese companies.\n\nThe problem hasn't gotten better with time. It's gotten worse.\n\n> Last year The Economist argued that lots of the supposed decoupling between America and China is in fact illusory. Look closer, we wrote, and the two countries\u2019 economic relationship is holding strong, even if this fact is masked by tricks on both sides. Since then a growing body of evidence confirms, and strengthens, our original findings. The economies of America and China are not coming apart. Indeed, some changes to supply chains may be binding the two countries even closer together.\n\nAt the end of the day, the macroeconomic explanation is very simple. China produces stuff. The US needs stuff. All the tariffs and regulations and bans and barriers in the world only makes the path from A to B more convoluted. As much as the US government might hate it, there is simply an enormous financial incentive for companies and people to work around each and every obstacle they throw up, which is why it keeps happening.

They even have a lot of pro russian tag themselves as pro Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>Every couple of weeks they let a big pro Ukraine post rise to the top (Navalny, Moskva, etc) because it would be more embarrassing not to have a post about it.</p>\n\n<p>To give an example of the fake pro ukraine posters on that sub, this is literally the first &quot;pro ukraine&quot; tagged comment on the sub currently:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>On a serious note, it truly is obvious and clear now how hateful the world (or their leaders to be precise) is/was towards Russia, even with the clean slate after the collapse of the Soviet Union. It really is a situation of self-fulfilling prophecies. Biased people create their reality through their erroneous ways, thoughts, and actions. Russia/Putin is no saint, but in the history of this conflict and this arena they&#39;ve been far more forthcoming and tried to be earnest far more than the West, who only dropped their mask after the war started, and God how ugly that was, and now you&#39;ve got poor Ukraine stuck in the middle getting torn to pieces.
