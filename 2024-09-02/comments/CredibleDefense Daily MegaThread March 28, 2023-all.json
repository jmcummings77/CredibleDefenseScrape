Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

However, a lot of people simply took it for granted that there would be no hard choices to make from trading with China.</p>\n</div>",

Employees of the firm, Airborne Technologies, which specialized in designing and equipping small aircraft with wireless surveillance platforms, had been ordered to work that weekend because one of the company\u2019s investors was scheduled to inspect their latest project.\n>     \n> For four months, Airborne\u2019s team had worked nearly nonstop to modify an American-made Thrush 510G crop duster to the exact specifications of an unnamed client. Everything about the project was cloaked in secrecy. The company\u2019s executives would refer to the client only as \u201cEcho Papa,\u201d and instructed employees to use code words to discuss certain modifications made to the plane.\n>     \n> The secrecy and strange modification requests of the past four months began to make sense. In addition to surveillance and laser-targeting equipment, Airborne had outfitted the plane with bulletproof cockpit windows, an armored engine block, anti-explosive mesh for the fuel tank, and specialized wiring that could control rockets and bombs.

Employees of the firm, Airborne Technologies, which specialized in designing and equipping small aircraft with wireless surveillance platforms, had been ordered to work that weekend because one of the company\u2019s investors was scheduled to inspect their latest project.</p>\n\n<p>For four months, Airborne\u2019s team had worked nearly nonstop to modify an American-made Thrush 510G crop duster to the exact specifications of an unnamed client. Everything about the project was cloaked in secrecy. The company\u2019s executives would refer to the client only as \u201cEcho Papa,\u201d and instructed employees to use code words to discuss certain modifications made to the plane.</p>\n\n<p>The secrecy and strange modification requests of the past four months began to make sense. In addition to surveillance and laser-targeting equipment, Airborne had outfitted the plane with bulletproof cockpit windows, an armored engine block, anti-explosive mesh for the fuel tank, and specialized wiring that could control rockets and bombs. The company also installed pods for mounting two high-powered 23 mm machine guns. By this point, the engineers and mechanics were concerned that they had broken several Austrian laws but were advised that everything would be fine as long as they all kept the secret.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

To be fair, this graph [comes from here](https://index.minfin.com.ua/en/russian-invading/casualties/) and the data is based on Ukrainian MOD figures, which are circumspect, but I had noticed a similar trend in the Oryx losses listed recently myself. \n\nSecond, I wanted to share [another thread from user Suyi](https://twitter.com/partizan_oleg/status/1640602591980830721?t=z7sRi-TLlIkNgdgpRSTvFg&s=19) that took a look at Russian tank losses to arrive at an estimate of remaining active duty Russian tanks. They arrive at an [estimate of around 2000 Russian active duty tanks](https://twitter.com/partizan_oleg/status/1640602626776760321?t=ZNFI5phJUJ1jFUNTpeVn_w&s=19) a decrease of around 1000 from Feb 24, 2022. He also suggests that T-80BVs are likely to become the workhorse of the Russian military if it hasn't already. He provides his methodology in the thread which is helpful and fairly well-reasoned imo (with the usual caveats that data available to the public is obviously limited).\n\nFinally, I wanted to share the [headline takeaways from the IISS Military Balance 2023 for both Russia](https://twitter.com/M0nstas/status/1639936956057387008?t=V67f0VsGmweieajFxbCnZQ&s=19) and [Ukraine](https://twitter.com/M0nstas/status/1639947470904913921?t=DYbRdF6Z3nsPAwMTul5Y5g&s=19). Interestingly IISS also found that the active duty Russian MBT force dropped by about 1,000 like Suyi had. They also estimate that the Russian MBT available in storage dropped from 10k to 5k, and that IFVs and APCs in storage were also halved, while they both had about 1000 fewer of each in active service as well. \n\nFor Ukraine, IISS estimates that its number of active duty AFVs increased across the board, but at the cost of most of their armored reserves. It raises concerns about the medium to longterm sustainability of Ukrainian AFVs without more Western support.",

If captured, it has no strategic meaning whatsoever from the view of Western observers, and they deem this ongoing bloody battle and not withdraw from Bakhmut as a futile and costly decision.\n\nBut what doesn't compute from my perspective in this narrative why Ukraine is pressing back as hard as the Russian army is trying to capture it. If it is of no strategic value as it is claimed by many, why engage the Russians there and waste precious (experienced) manpower, ammunition and weapons platforms? Why not slowly fall back and attrit the Russians that way and suffer less casualties? Each newly established Ukrainian entrenched front needs costly Russian probing attacks and seems to be a better way of weakening Russians capabilities if that is the current decision to keep fighting in Bakhmut. And perhaps where better than in urban terrain, even when the city is virtually encircled.\n\nOr perhaps there is a real threat, once Bakhmut falls, to the cities of Slovyansk and Kramatorsk. Perhaps it might have farther reaching consequences to the Donetsk front which most Western observers are not able to foresee. We have seen the bigger gains, albeit tiny in the grand scheme of things, the Russians have made were not in urban terrain, but in open, farmland terrain. And not much lies between Bakhmut and Slovyansk & Kramatorsk in regards to urban terrain. So that might be a good reason to try to keep Bakhmut as a hardpoint in the current front. Why Ukrainian Army allowed the flanks of Bakhmit collapse and not reconquer them is equally a mystery to me as it makes defending Bakhmut ten times harder.\n\nWe don't know the casualty rate for both sides, but we have all seen the countless death-from-above videos where Russian soldiers are getting mauled to death. They are taking a hefty toll in their relentless attack on Bakhmut.\n\nOn Ukraine side it is said it is a bloody battle as well. To what ratio, I think neither sides really know, except Ukrainian High Command deems it worthy as is. They really want to make it as difficult as possible for the Russians to capture Bakhmut.\n\nThere might be a political perspective to it were losing ground is not an option anymore to the Ukrainian political leadership. But as far as I am aware from interviews with Zelensky I've seen: he lets the military decisions to the Ukrainian military High Command.\n\nSo basically, it is all one big guessing show and armchair generals here can't find common ground on this, as you will undoubtedly see in the coming comments on this one or be following this daily thread for a week or two.\n\nEdit: typos and some rewording.",

However, each country sent enough tanks for at least one company each. Each tank company will normally have its own mechanics.

Some other company will be doing the same for the Challenger 2s.\n\nIf a tank gets so damaged or broken that the company mechanics can't handle it, the tank will probably just get shipped across the Polish border and NATO mechanics will handle it (or trade it out). Which isn't all that different to what would happen even if they were all the same model of NATO tank.\n\nAs for \"why don't other countries just reimburse one country?\" The amount of tanks being sent is larger than most European armies' total number of tanks. Convincing a country to voluntarily strip their army of tanks is going to be tricky. And tanks aren't produced all that quickly. It would take the donor country years to catch back up in practical terms, even if they were financially reimbursed.\n\nAlternately, the donor country would find themselves in the same position Ukraine, the proud owners of a mixed fleet of whatever their allies had to spare.\n\nWe have seen some movement along the lines of \"donate and back fill\" last year.
