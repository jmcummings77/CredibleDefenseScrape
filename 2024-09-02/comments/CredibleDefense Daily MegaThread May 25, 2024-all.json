So I want to completely pre-empt any assumptions that this is some imminent implementation.</p>\n\n<p>But I am posting it 1: because I know someone else <em>will</em>, likely <em>without</em> that highly relevant bit of context that this is coming from a party staring down a defeat that would be the worst in it\u2019s history and thus completely non credible (hence, pre-empting), and 2: it is a bit of defence policy news, after all. I\u2019m sure there can be some interesting discussions about the theoretical repercussions for the British military if this actually had the slightest chance of going into place. Potential costs of implementation, effects on the British Army as a whole, changes in procurement that could accompany such a move, how this theoretical conscription-boosted army might look, etc.</p>\n</div>",
