Not only will it keep a large reserve in Ukraine so that it can counter anything unexpected but it will also keep a large reserve in Russia, basically there is a world outside Ukraine and Russia cannot afford to have no resources to deal with it. I'm not an artillery man, I don't know exactly how big this reserve needs to be, but it will be significant, possibly as much as 5 million shells (around 100 days worth of high intensity conflict). If that is true then the actual number of 'good' shells available was 10 million. Going off the estimates in the tweet Russia could have fired 8 million of those already. That only gives them 2 million left before Russia starts having to make serious decisions about it's usage. The point is, if the numbers in this tweet are right, Russia is running low on 'good' shells.\n\nThis brings us to the soviet era shells, of which there are a claimed 108 million. Obviously that number is debatable; these shells are over 30 years old, Russia is not famous for looking after old kit and lots of stuff went missing in post soviet Russia, but there may be a very large number of these shells which theoretically makes the short supply of 'good' shells irrelevant. The is one detail in the tweet that makes me question whether these shells are even available. In tweet 4 the author says that Russia can manufacture 1million shells a year and 'restore 0.5m old Soviet Shells'. This implies that these 108million aren't ready to be sent to Ukraine, that work needs to be done to prepare them for use and that that process is slow. \n\nI may have misunderstood the author (and he may simply be wrong) but he suggests that Russia have burnt through 80% of their pre-war supply and will either have to start heavily restricting their use of Artillery or start eating into their strategic reserve very soon.\n\nNote- please feel free to challenge my assumptions, they are just that.",

One truck driver on her street corner even left the engine running as he popped to the shop for a beer.\n\nThat all changed at 6am on Monday morning.\n\nA series of huge explosions woke up everyone in Azovske, shaking the windows of her home.\n\u201cFor the first few minutes I couldn\u2019t understand what it was: I thought someone was shelling us,\u201d she told The Telegraph.\n\n\u201cThen we realised it was the ammunition dump.\u201d\n\nCrimea hit by number of mystery attacks\n\nCrimea, once Russia\u2019s most fortified outpost, has been hit by a series of mystery attacks in recent weeks and is now consumed with talk of special forces operating deep behind enemy lines.\n\nOn Friday, explosions were reported near an airbase in Belbek, on the peninsula's southwest coast, while Moscow said its air defence systems had shot at targets over the Kerch bridge to Russia.\n\nLocals described to The Telegraph how ill-disciplined Russian soldiers transiting between the mainland and the frontlines have been dumping powerful weaponry at makeshift storage sites.\n\nMuch of the movement witnessed by Svetlana - who asked to be identified under a false name for security reasons - began around the time Ukraine started hitting Russian ammunition dumps with long-range Himars missile launchers supplied by the US.\n\nSome analysts say Russia has been moving its ammunition and equipment back into Crimea to protect it ahead of a possible counter offensive from Ukraine.\n\nSvetlana said Russian soldiers swarmed the countryside about two months ago, bringing the ammunition to the pig-farm in both trains and trucks.\n\n\u201cThis is when the whole village felt the war got so close to us.\u201d\nThe military settled in at the farm in Mayske on the other side of the railway tracks from Azovske, transporting long-range missiles in front of the whole village.\n\n\u201cThe way they handled it - it all appeared so careless. They did everything in the open and didn\u2019t bother to make any secret of it,\u201d Svetlana said.\n\nShe saw a lorry filled with ammunition for the Grad multiple grenade launcher parked near the village shop:\n\u201cThe guy went into the shop to get beer, and no one was guarding it.\u201d\n\nA video released by the Ukrainian armed forces and shot from a train window purportedly at the edge of Mayske\u2019s depot before the attack showed crates of ammunition dumped on the dry ground with missile rocket launchers parked nearby.\n\nWhen the dump finally blew up on Monday, Svetlana's father, wearing only shorts, jumped into the car and drove the family a dozen kilometres away. Behind them, ammunition kept detonating for the next three hours.\nKremlin officials used to warn that attacking Vladimir Putin\u2019s prized conquest would cross a red line, provoking a \u201cdoomsday\u201d response.\n\nYet Russia played down the first massive explosion that rocked Crimea on August 8.\n\nThe military blamed \u201cviolations of fire safety\u201d for the blast on an airbase that destroyed a dozen Russian aircraft and sent plumes of smoke over a local beach full of tourists from the mainland.\n\nUkraine, for its part, suggested that special forces carried out the strike with the help of local partisans - although the account has yet to be verified.\n\n\u201cThe goal is to show the occupiers that they are not at home, that they should not settle in, that they should not sleep comfortably,\u201d one partisan with the callsign Svarog, after a pagan Slavic god of fire, told the New York Times.\n\nHe said he joined a programme run by Ukrainian paramilitaries to train civilians in resistance. Ukrainian special forces, meanwhile, have been running parallel courses on sabotage.\n\nOn one mission, Svarog said he was directed to destroy a storage shed with crates of high explosives, detonators, Kalashnikov rifles, a grenade launcher and two pistols equipped with silencers.\n\nLocals inside Crimea recounted stories of flagrant negligence by Russian soldiers that would make any such attack surprisingly easy to pull off.\n\n\u201cI often see drunk soldiers walking around,\u201d Anna, who works at a holiday resort and asked her identity to be concealed for fear of repercussions, said.\n\n\u201cDo you think it\u2019s difficult to trade a bottle of vodka for a grenade from them?\u201d\n\nTourists have grown used to hearing fighter jets whizzing over the beach, and locals entertain themselves on long car rides by counting lorries with Russians soldiers.\n\nWhen war broke out in February Crimea was splashed with billboards showing Vladimir Putin alongside his slogans: \u201cWe were left with no other choice\u201d and \u201cRussia doesn\u2019t start wars. It finishes them.\"\n\nPro-Russians in Crimea have 'gone quiet'\n\nA few months ago, the mood changed dramatically, and the billboards gave way to sombre portraits of killed Russian soldiers with the words: \u201cGlory to heroes of Russia!\u201d\n\nThe initial expectation that the war would be over in a few months, if not weeks, has planted doubt in many pro-Kremlin Crimeans. Some grumble about mounting casualties. Others complain about not being able to see their families in Ukraine.\n\nNow and then a stray missile, fired from Crimea against targets in mainland Ukraine, would land in somebody\u2019s backyard but it was only after the recent series of explosions that Crimeans began to worry.\n\n\u201cThose who were pro-Russian have all gone quiet. They don\u2019t argue any more,\" says Anna.\n\nWhen her elderly neighbour, a Putin supporter who binge-watches Russian state TV, recently had a grandson to stay, they went through their options of which part of Russia to flee to in case of war.\n\nTourism supplies the main source of income for many Crimeans. But hotel owners have in recent weeks reported a 50 per cent drop in bookings and sales. Some of the most popular hotels were fully booked as recently as mid-July when hostilities in Ukraine seemed to have stalled.\n\n\u201cTourists are scared of going to Crimea: they know hostilities might break out here, and what if the Crimean bridge blows up?\u201d a hotel employee in Alushta on Crimea\u2019s southern coast told The Telegraph.\n\nThe highly controversial bridge, built by Russia over the Strait of Kerch in 2018 to link Crimea with the Russian mainland, was once hailed as a symbol of the Kremlin\u2019s iron grip on the annexed peninsula. It was through this bridge that Moscow managed to bring in large amounts of heavy weaponry that rolled into the Kherson region in February.\n\nThese days, the \u00a33 billion bridge is the only way to escape Crimea to safety but many think it might be too late.\n\u201cA lot of people left after [the explosion] in Novofedorivka last week, saying \u2018let\u2019s get out of here while the bridge still stands\u2019,\u201d Svetlana said.\n\nAs well as the unexplained explosions in Crimea, the peninsula has fallen prey to psy-ops.\n\nAt the peak of the summer the phone began to ring at a major resort in Saky, near the site of the first explosion.\n\nOn the end of the line was an official issuing orders for immediate evacuation. Guests were notified and began moving to a safe place when the manager called the local ministry to double check provisions were in place. There was no order.\n\nThe incident was reported by Oleg Tsaryov, a former Ukrainian lawmaker turned separatist official, who said that same resort and other places have also been targeted by bomb threats.\n\n\u201c[The Ukrainians\u2019] task is not only to carry out terrorist attacks and sabotage but also sow panic among visitors and residents of Crimea,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Crimeans are bracing themselves for the worst: the residents interviewed by The Telegraph interviewed said they have grab bags packed just in case.\n\nSvetlana, whose family has lived in Crimea for generations, said her relatives do not want to leave the peninsula and are now busy stocking food in the basement of their house.\n\nPro-Ukrainian Crimeans, whose views could land them in jail if made public, whisper among themselves about a much-anticipated Ukrainian counter-offensive.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere. Who\u2019s going to open the gate to greet our guys when they come back?\u201d she said.",

Ukrainian special forces, meanwhile, have been running parallel courses on sabotage.</p>\n\n<p>On one mission, Svarog said he was directed to destroy a storage shed with crates of high explosives, detonators, Kalashnikov rifles, a grenade launcher and two pistols equipped with silencers.</p>\n\n<p>Locals inside Crimea recounted stories of flagrant negligence by Russian soldiers that would make any such attack surprisingly easy to pull off.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI often see drunk soldiers walking around,\u201d Anna, who works at a holiday resort and asked her identity to be concealed for fear of repercussions, said.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDo you think it\u2019s difficult to trade a bottle of vodka for a grenade from them?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Tourists have grown used to hearing fighter jets whizzing over the beach, and locals entertain themselves on long car rides by counting lorries with Russians soldiers.</p>\n\n<p>When war broke out in February Crimea was splashed with billboards showing Vladimir Putin alongside his slogans: \u201cWe were left with no other choice\u201d and \u201cRussia doesn\u2019t start wars. It finishes them.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Pro-Russians in Crimea have &#39;gone quiet&#39;</p>\n\n<p>A few months ago, the mood changed dramatically, and the billboards gave way to sombre portraits of killed Russian soldiers with the words: \u201cGlory to heroes of Russia!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The initial expectation that the war would be over in a few months, if not weeks, has planted doubt in many pro-Kremlin Crimeans. Some grumble about mounting casualties. Others complain about not being able to see their families in Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>Now and then a stray missile, fired from Crimea against targets in mainland Ukraine, would land in somebody\u2019s backyard but it was only after the recent series of explosions that Crimeans began to worry.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThose who were pro-Russian have all gone quiet. They don\u2019t argue any more,&quot; says Anna.</p>\n\n<p>When her elderly neighbour, a Putin supporter who binge-watches Russian state TV, recently had a grandson to stay, they went through their options of which part of Russia to flee to in case of war.</p>\n\n<p>Tourism supplies the main source of income for many Crimeans. But hotel owners have in recent weeks reported a 50 per cent drop in bookings and sales. Some of the most popular hotels were fully booked as recently as mid-July when hostilities in Ukraine seemed to have stalled.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cTourists are scared of going to Crimea: they know hostilities might break out here, and what if the Crimean bridge blows up?\u201d a hotel employee in Alushta on Crimea\u2019s southern coast told The Telegraph.</p>\n\n<p>The highly controversial bridge, built by Russia over the Strait of Kerch in 2018 to link Crimea with the Russian mainland, was once hailed as a symbol of the Kremlin\u2019s iron grip on the annexed peninsula. It was through this bridge that Moscow managed to bring in large amounts of heavy weaponry that rolled into the Kherson region in February.</p>\n\n<p>These days, the \u00a33 billion bridge is the only way to escape Crimea to safety but many think it might be too late.\n\u201cA lot of people left after [the explosion] in Novofedorivka last week, saying \u2018let\u2019s get out of here while the bridge still stands\u2019,\u201d Svetlana said.</p>\n\n<p>As well as the unexplained explosions in Crimea, the peninsula has fallen prey to psy-ops.</p>\n\n<p>At the peak of the summer the phone began to ring at a major resort in Saky, near the site of the first explosion.</p>\n\n<p>On the end of the line was an official issuing orders for immediate evacuation. Guests were notified and began moving to a safe place when the manager called the local ministry to double check provisions were in place. There was no order.</p>\n\n<p>The incident was reported by Oleg Tsaryov, a former Ukrainian lawmaker turned separatist official, who said that same resort and other places have also been targeted by bomb threats.</p>\n\n<p>\u201c[The Ukrainians\u2019] task is not only to carry out terrorist attacks and sabotage but also sow panic among visitors and residents of Crimea,&quot; he said.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Crimeans are bracing themselves for the worst: the residents interviewed by The Telegraph interviewed said they have grab bags packed just in case.</p>\n\n<p>Svetlana, whose family has lived in Crimea for generations, said her relatives do not want to leave the peninsula and are now busy stocking food in the basement of their house.</p>\n\n<p>Pro-Ukrainian Crimeans, whose views could land them in jail if made public, whisper among themselves about a much-anticipated Ukrainian counter-offensive.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere. Who\u2019s going to open the gate to greet our guys when they come back?\u201d she said.</p>\n</div>",

            "body": "Russia claims that Relikt is twice as effective as Kontakt-5, and that it's more capable against low velocity munitions like HEAT. But your question isn't answerable. Where was the hit, what's the tank, what's the munition, hell even the temperature. Way too many variables, not enough data.\n\nAs far as the US - M1 Abrams, Germany - Leo 2, Israel - Merkava, UK - Challenger II, Italy - C1 Ariete, they all use composite or non-explosive reactive armor(NERA). Plates of various materials are left with a air gap and set at angle so that incoming ordnance doesn't hit at 90 degrees. [Here is a damaged M1A1 showing a section of NERA](https://i.imgur.com/Jco8nfa.png). Soviet tanks since the T-72A(and the T-64B) have used a composite armor as well, but not nearly to the same extent for protection against HEAT munitions. This is composite called 'textolite', there is no air gap and it's layered between steel on the turret face and and upper glacis. This made for a light weight and compact armor, in comparison to the NERA arrays on the M1 which take up more volume and weight.\n\nDoctrine wise the Soviets went with autoloaders to eliminate a crew member, a light weight tank to support existing infrastructure, and as small as possible to make the tank hard to hit. This is very evident in a silhouette of a [M60A1 against a T-72](https://i.imgur.com/al1HMYZ.jpeg), or a [M1 against a T-72](https://i.redd.it/mtwtamct1t821.jpg). As built the T-72A(and T-64B) had extremely effective frontal armor, enough the point where it forced NATO to switch from 105mm guns. So when it was time to up armor the T-64/72/80 ERA made a excellent choice. It's light weight, relatively easy to install, repair, and manufacture. Not so great for any infantry that might be around the tank when it goes off. In the case of the M1 Abrams the existing NERA arrays have been removed and upgraded, along with entirely new turrets. \n\nThat isn't to say Western tanks don't use ERA, the M1 Tank Urban Survival Kit(TUSK) has ERA added to the side skirts, the Merkava IV has ERA up armoring, the Turks put ERA on their Leo 2A4s.",

In addition, the Baron Korf communications battalion is being formed in Khabarovsk Region.  </p>\n\n<p>...  </p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou can easily earn around R1 mln this summer!\u201d beckon posters in Tatarstan. The average monthly salary in the region, according to Rosstat, was R45.9k in February, below the national average of R57.3k. In many regions outside the Far North, the average salary is even lower: R41.3k in Bashkortostan, R40.9k in Voronezh Region, R38.7k in Kursk, R35.2k in Ulyanovsk, R34.2k in Mordovia. Also consider that in the current deepening crisis, people often lose both their jobs and the opportunity to receive a guaranteed full salary.  </p>\n\n<p>...  </p>\n\n<p>Overall, this long-term project of regularly replenishing the army fighting in Ukraine testifies not only to the serious problems faced by the Kremlin due to large losses in manpower, but also to the fact that the authorities are considering the prospect of a long-term positional war. It is Russia\u2019s answer to the Ukrainian Territorial Defense Forces.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",
