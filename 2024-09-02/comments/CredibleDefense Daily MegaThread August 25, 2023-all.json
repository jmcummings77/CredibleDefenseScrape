As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

The fields north of Robotyne were the first line of defense because Russia expended resources to place vast minefields littered with truly excessive numbers of mines.

Plenty of trenches were dug there and had to be overcome. I can show you proof on satellite if you'd like, or just show Brady's red dots. Another extensive trench system is south of Robotyne, and another one west of Robotyne.\n\nThere's nothing special about the dragons teeth line that it is the first *real* line of defense. It undersells the tremendous amount of resources and effort Russia expended to prevent Ukraine's advance so far, and vastly undersells the amount of work Ukraine had to put in to take it. Likewise, it vastly overestimates the potential effectiveness of the dragons teeth and antitank ditch. Finally, it ignores terrain elevation: Robotyne was high ground. There are a few areas with higher ground, like one hill I've seen nicknamed as \"Hill 166\" given its 166 m elevation. But the main struggle with taking Robotyne was that AFU had to fight uphill with clear fields of fire. Now they don't. Terrain is often the best line of defense.

But I can say that RAF and USAF Rivet Joint aircraft (electronic intelligence) are very often in the region as are E-3 AWACs, P3 Poseidon and a host of other intelligence gathering aircraft. There is very likely a very intense battle in the electromagnetic spectrum. Everything they turn on is being mapped and fed back to the Ukrainians. Maybe not just mapping, certainly the UK and US would not mind a bit of their own jamming. \n\nThere are 6 KH-11 Kennan currently on orbit. Plus at least 100 lower resolution commercial satellites. That means likely twice a day every Russian airbase in European Russia is getting looked at by the most powerful cameras in space not called James Webb Telescope. (Hubble was derived form the KH-11)\n\nSo Ukraine and European Russia is probably under a degree of scrutiny that is an order of magnitude greater than any other state in history.

Being super generous they might be able to carry half the mass as their railways. Tokmak specifically may not be receiving trains, but its a major truck road.  Rail is actually pretty easy to repair and the Russians are good at it, but having a loaded train park up that close to where it might be observed is likely a non starter. But they do use rail further back. \n\nTheir \"motor pool\" or trucks are horrible, outdated and to few for the size of the army deployed. They are apparently using civilian trucks to carry good, so the sort of HGV/semi you will see on the road. But they need a smooth road to run on. So the ability to constantly crater the road means everything will have to be in 4\\*4 or 6\\*6 off road trucks that can get around damage. \n\nIf you look at a railway map you can see there are 3 routes in. \n\n[https://reliefweb.int/map/ukraine/ukraine-complex-map-railways-ukraine-5-mar-2022](https://reliefweb.int/map/ukraine/ukraine-complex-map-railways-ukraine-5-mar-2022)\n\n2 coming out of Crimea and one through Tokmak. One of the routes from Crimea get routine visits from Storm Shadow (Chonhar), the other swings close to Kherson. The one on the north is in GMRLS range but not artillery. I doubt its in use but it is easy to repair railways so might be for small freight trains. \n\nThe Chonhar line is only reachable by Storm Shadow and can be used to build big supply dumps outside of GMLRS range, this is what Storm Shadow hit in Rykove. This means they cannot have big dumps to sustain operations if they lose access to Crimea. \n\n[https://liveuamap.com/](https://liveuamap.com/)\n\nThis will show the roads, the main road of concern is that from Mariupol to Melitopol. This is the one they are trying to bring into GMLRS range. This is the one they can use large civilian trucks to move heavy equipment for logistics hubs before being broken down into smaller 4\\*4 trucks that can handle the off road diversions closer to the front. \n\nSo hitting the road near the Black Sea will mean they have to use their small fleet of off road capable trucks, taking them from a large number of other tasks. And having Tokmak under artillery means you can really smash up the roads there making it slower and harder to keep supplies flowing through and perhaps causing traffic jams that can be targeted.\n\nThis will risk making everything east of Tokmak and north of Crimea into a \"pocket\" where troops are not really able to be adequately supplied. \n\nObviously for this to play out Ukraine will need to make more advances.

        "body": "Since it\u2019s first comment for the morning, I thought I\u2019d go out on a limb with a few fact based opinions regarding how the offensive is going.\n\nFirst, news sources, I\u2019m looking at yo CNN NYT and WaPo vetting sources. There\u2019s a lot of officers and analysts who haven\u2019t supported Ukraine from the first, a lot in CYA mode because their analysis didn\u2019t work out and a lot of guys willing to have strong opinions about matters for which they are only lightly briefed. If you guys can\u2019t break yourself of the anonymous source habit, you need to at least publicly. Vet that the source is qualified to discuss matters authoritatively.\n\nSecond, I\u2019m curious where all the Mech brigades have gone. There should be an entire third corps ready to swing into the offensive.  The 21st with its Swedish gear, the 88th, the new trained 41st, 42nd , 43rd and 44th , are all showing as deployed in defense in the north, a role much better suited to the TDBs backed up by Tank Brigades and big artillery groups. I suspect they are only half engaged, \u2018see the elephant\u2019 engaged and are really still in deep training.  Fully rested and rearmed TDF Brigades will soon be available to rotate in, at which point I would expect them to reform to the south as a 3rd mechanized waive for the offensive.\n\nThird, I did a drill down on the TDF, as they didn\u2019t seem to be pulling their weight for an \u2018all hands in\u2019 type offensive push. By my count, 15 brigades are off the line, 12 of which haven\u2019t been engaged even lightly all spring. Reading through public sources, it seems that the Nabobs committed to greater training and equipment for the TDF and a process that should have wrapped in the spring drags on.  The good news I\u2019d that they have a lot more oomph to them now. Automatic grenade launchers, HMGs and smaller mortars are now in place down to company level, better comms and medivac are in place, battalions now have heavy mortars more consistently and protected transport is now in place. Most had a mech company on paper and now have one for real ( a few have small battalions) as well as the artillery their TOS said they had. \n\nFourth, a word about the Air Assault Forces. I\u2019m surprised they remain disbursed and in several cases in defensive roles they are totally unsuited for. They are elite trained brigades, but small, and medium armored. But put them all together, give them a tank brigade and an artillery brigade for contingencies and the whole is worth more than the sum of the parts. Just saying. \n\nFifth, I\u2019m as baffled by the Interior Ministry\u2019s contribution as ever.  The offensive guard appears to have been little more than rebranding for the National Guard, the new Assault Brigades are scattered all over the place, some don\u2019t even look employed, and they certainly aren\u2019t being used for assault.  I wouldn\u2019t suggest they be given a sector of their own, like the marines have and the AABs should- They would fight better with a dedicated corps command in somewhere like Bakmut or Kreminna. \n\nSixth I still have no idea where the 13th Jaeger has gotten to. Kind of my white whale. All I can figure is that they are still in intensive training to cross the Dnipro up in the drained reservoir- waiting for the weeds to grow enough to provide some cover and the water levels to settle in. I hope their being kept in reserve to storm a Nuke plant.  They have the right training, their vehicles are mostly amphibious, they\u2019ve trained in boats and helos and Idont want to see a nuke plant intentionally blasted, so my copium is showing.\n\nFinally, the Kherson front. I'm still not convinced it's more than SOFs being SOFs, with the limited goal of holding down as many Russian units as possible.  If it's more, we're going to need to see either two more beach heads to spread them out further, or a further major draw down of forces to the main front before any balloons go up.",

He says that those early assaults showed inability of command teams to handle friction (delays resulted in break downs of combined arms) and to function at scale (the fights never got above the company level it seems). Again I don't know if this is an issue with those units, with UAF in general, or with the very aggressive forward defense by the Russians.",

            "body": "Thanks for the updates!\n\nI wonder if some of the Territorial Defence brigades could be used as a pool to recruit men for the new \"regular\" brigades and thus left undermanned. When it comes to several TD brigades that had suffered very heavy losses in the past, such as the 119th TD Brigade around Soledar, I've heard nothing about whether they would be reorganizing or not. Other TD brigades on the other hand would have received mechanized platoons with BTR-70s as far as I could see; the 110th TD Brigade has gotten a handful of captured T-62s if I recall correctly. Some of the TD brigades are fighting and growing well (I'm thinking of the 127th) and may deserve to become motorized or mechanized brigades.\n\nDo you have any updates on the 88th Mech? I never knew if their deployment around Kupyansk had been confirmed or not. The 13th Jager Brigade, on the other hand, posted a video on their FB page a couple of weeks ago in which they wrote they were in the \"northern operational zone\". Perhaps on the border with Belgorod Oblast? This is the first news about them in months. \n\nI absolutely agree with the need to group the Air Assault Forces into one sector, along the lines of the Marine Corps in the Velyka Novosilka sector - we are partly starting to witness this in the direction of Tokmak (82nd and 46th Airmobile Brigades, elements of the 71st Jager Brigades with probably support from the 78th Air Assault Regiment). The Air Assault Forces have good command structure and officers, it makes sense to try to concentrate them in as few areas as possible that are deemed as particularly important. Seeing the 81st Airmobile Brigade in Bilohorivka since October and the 79th Air Assault Brigade in Marinka since last September feels almost a waste. Especially now that Russian efforts in Marinka have thinned out with them moving part of the 150th MRD to Bakhmut.\n\nI wonder if the new Reserve Rifle Brigades being formed will be used to relieve brigades deployed in hot sectors but without major territorial changes, such as Avdiivka (as has already happened with the 142nd Rifle Brigade, whose deployment allowed the 35th and 36th Marine Brigades to be moved to Velyka Novosilka) or Marinka. In my opinion, the purpose of these new brigades will be to make the role of the TDF more efficient and free up veteran brigades for other areas.",

The crew is said to have been in Ukraine before and after the sabotage.**  \n>  \n>There are growing indications that the perpetrators behind the attacks on the Nord Stream pipelines could have connections to Ukraine. Officially, the Federal Prosecutor's Office continues to investigate unknown persons. However, according to information from ZDF frontal and \"Spiegel,\" people familiar with the investigation consider the leads to Ukraine to be particularly convincing. There is no reliable evidence of suspects from Russia.  \n>  \n>The investigators' findings so far point clearly in the direction of Ukraine, they said. The investigators continue to focus on a six-man commando on board the sailing yacht \"Andromeda\". Before and after the explosions in the Baltic Sea, the group is said to have been in Ukraine. This was indicated by technical data, which the investigators were able to evaluate. This is what \"Spiegel\" and ZDF learned from security circles.  \n>  \n>It is also possible that video recordings of the alleged perpetrators from the Polish port of Kolberg - where the \"Andromeda\" stopped - exist.  \n>  \n>The Chancellor's Office is also monitoring the case closely. Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) had discussed several times with advisors how the German government could deal politically with possible Ukrainian perpetrators.\u202f\u202f  \n>  \n>A turning point was the publication of the \"New York Times\", the \"Zeit\" and the RBB at the beginning of March. In the same month, Jens Pl\u00f6tner - Scholz's foreign policy advisor - spoke on the phone with Zelensky's confidant Andriy Yermak and also discussed Nord Stream, according to the report. Yermak had stressed that the Ukrainian government was not behind the attack. After the phone call, Chancellor Scholz continued to see no alternative to Germany's support for Kiev, despite the explosive evidence.  \n>  \n>Another explosive intelligence report points to Ukraine. Months before the attacks, the Dutch military intelligence service received a warning: six people wanted to dive from a small boat to the Nord Stream pipes and blow them up - they were Ukrainians, according to the information. The source also specified the time period: mid-June 2022, during a NATO exercise on the Baltic Sea.\u202f  \n>  \n>The Dutch also forwarded the explosive message to the U.S. intelligence service CIA, which informed the German intelligence service BND in June 2022. This was first reported by the Washington Post.\u202f  \n>  \n>Because the time window mentioned by the informant passed without an attack occurring, Germany did not take any further protective measures for the pipeline in 2022, ZDF and \"Spiegel\" learned. The U.S. had also already informally contacted Kiev and strongly advised against possible attack plans, as reported by \"Zeit\" and ARD.  \n>  \n>The \"Washington Post\" also reported that the sabotage plans at the time took place without the Ukrainian president's complicity, but under the command of the Ukrainian commander-in-chief, General Valery Zaluzhnyi. Kiev rejects this. The Ukrainian embassy did not respond to a ZDF inquiry about the new allegations.  \n>  \n>On September 26, 2022, the pipelines did explode, just as the Dutch source had predicted back in June 2022. Shortly after the attacks, the Dutch gave the Germans another clue. Afterwards, a sailing boat was searched for - only in this way did the authorities find the charter yacht \"Andromeda\".  \n>  \n>In January, the Federal Criminal Police Office then had the 15-meter boat searched. Investigators found traces of explosives on the table below deck. Remnants of the same explosive were also found in the tubes on the seabed. The explosive in question is HMX, also known as octogen.\u202f\u202f  \n>  \n>Marine expert G\u00f6ran Swistek estimates that 40 kilograms of it were needed for each explosion site. But where did the HMX come from? Swistek told ZDF frontal:  \n>  \n>\"In that amount of explosives, I assume that it would not have gone undetected. Therefore, I am more inclined to the variant that it probably came from state sources, from military stocks, which were then made available for this operation.\"  \n>  \n>From the \"Andromeda\", divers could have planted the explosives on the seabed, as confirmed by experts commissioned by the Attorney General. Ex-Bundeswehr combat swimmer Jens H\u00f6ner also believes this is feasible. He explained to Frontal that he would use a so-called shotline - a long rope with a weight attached to it. The weight would then land at the bottom on or directly next to the pipeline.  \n>  \n>\"The diver holds on to the shotline, then dives down, places the explosive charge next to the pipeline, goes back to the bottom rope and then does his decompression and goes back on board,\" H\u00f6ner describes a possible procedure.  \n>  \n>The explosive remnants on the table of the yacht are also plausible for H\u00f6ner.

I think we can safely say that Russian polling orginization operating in Russia interviewing Russians is going to have much, much bigger problems.\n\nPolling is not so \"incredibly sophisticated\" that it can magic it's way around people's rational fear of the state, nor is this polling agency protected from the state itself.  Seeing as how this is a nation where you can't call the Ukraine war a war, no one is being paranoid for thinking that this polling agency will not post negative polling data in the current political climate.\n\nPutin certainly has support from a part of the population.  We just have no clue how big that part of the population is, nor how quickly it will happily flip positions if the time came.\n\nGranted, it isn't like any of this matters.  The opinion of the Russian people doesn't matter as long as they have the political agency of a medieval serf.

Its a very high skillset job where most of those applying do not get through. You have a $50 million machine so you need the best 80kg of meat in the seat to make the most of what we pay for. \n\nFor the Ukraine situation you have an area that is covered with Europes best and second best air defence networks. This denies Europes biggest air force (Russia) the capacity to operate with any real freedom. So you have to be able to manage that threat when flying you will be operating at altitudes commensurate with the threat so often close to the ground. Part of your brain has to manage flying at about 550mph in the very choppy air close to the ground and the changing terrain. Part of your brain has to be managing the constant changing electronic emissions threat and part of your brain has to be working on where possible kinetic threats can come from or already be coming from. \n\nThat  is you flying alone, now to be good at air war, you would need to be flying with multiple groups of aircraft each focussing on different tasks in help surpress the air defences and engage with opposition fighters i.e. clear them and obtain some localised air superiority temporarily to allow your attack aircraft to carry out a mission. \n\nStealth would help a lot as it reduces the range the SAMs and airborne radars can see you. It means you can do more closer to the front, be higher thus have more range with radars and missiles and it would to a small degree reduce the cognitive load on your brain. \n\nBetter missiles are a must, something like Meteor the Russians sit high over the Black Sea firing off RM-37s. This means they get to sit pretty away from SAM threats and can see Ukrainian jets in the far distance and fire a missile at them that can outrun their Fulcrums. So having something similar will push back that threat. \n\nAnd a lot of Patriot batteries. They help build nogo areas for Russian air craft that will help to establish local air superiority. \n\nElectronic warfare pods, they will need a good number of modern EW kit to help manage the electromagnetic war. \n\nAnd a big magazine full of anti radiation missiles.",

To call Mexico a narco state is like calling Italy a mafia state and Japan a yakuza state - it\u2019s name calling without meaning. \n\nThe government (which government? Much like the US, Mexico has many layers of government) is not controlled by narcos, and I think saying AMLO and his presidential staff are in the pockets of the gangs is not just false but a dangerous presumption when it comes to viewing Mexican-American relations. \n\nAm I saying narcos are not a problem? Not at all, they are a huge problem for the country. But it\u2019s an oversimplification to say they control the state or even part of the state. There\u2019s significant regional variance in the level of gang control, with states like Michoac\u00e1n or Coahuila significantly worse off than say Oaxaca or Yucat\u00e1n. Even in the most affected states, they certainly do not control parliament or the governor\u2019s house.\n\nAdded to this, political control by cartels is actually decreasing, not increasing. The past decade and a half has seen many of the powerful cartels shatter into smaller fractions leading to more intra-gang fighting, and unfortunately, civilian deaths. The fact that there is more violence is not an indication of political control, I\u2019d be more tempted to say the cartels in the 80s and 90s, prior to the military crackdown, were more politically powerful than they are now.\n\nSo to answer the question, the basic premise is wrong, meaning the question as to whether there is a need for intervention becomes moot. If certain parts of Mexico do fully come under cartel control, without the federal government able to intervene, I could see Mexico perhaps requesting troops and air support to deal with that localised conflict, but there wouldn\u2019t be much appetite for it by the US, I would imagine.",
