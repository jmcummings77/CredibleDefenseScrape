        "body": "This morning the Ukrainian military observer Mashovets published the most recent estimate, by Ukrainian military intelligence, of the Russian grouping deployed in Ukraine. I will also include the latest estimates for a comparison.\n\n\nTime period | Personnel | MBTs | IFVs, APCs & IMVs | Artillery guns \u2265 100mm | MLRS\n:-------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:---------:\nLate April 2023 | 396'000 | 1'764 | 4'289  |  2'994 | 870\nEarly September 2023 | 420'000 | 2'260 | 5'260 | 3'050 | 920\nEarly October 2023 | 429'000 | 2'347 | 5'653 | 3'186 | 974\nLate October 2023 | 441'700 | 2'324 | 5'661 | 3'148 | 982\nEarly February 2024 | 469'800 | 2'797 | 7'218 | 4'843 | 1'142\n\nTo this we must add 48 operational-tactical missile launchers. 120mm mortars, which play an increasingly important role in Russian fires (as a surrogate for 122mm artillery) are included, to my knowledge, as well as 100mm MT-12s. \n\nAs we see, equipment is growing much more than men. This is consistent with the current Russian strategy, with the notable exception of the first part of the Avdiivka offensive, of reducing the use of armored vehicles in large mechanized assaults in favor of Wagner-style infantry attacks, often as reconnaissance in force, where armored vehicles are not always present or mostly play an infantry support role. It\u2019s also consistent with the recent creation of new tank units (as well as artillery ones), while the share of Russian troops within regiments of the Territorial Forces, which are de facto rifle regiments, is gradually declining as a share of total troops deployed.\n\nThe numbers don\u2019t include tactical, operational and strategic reserves (60/62 thousand men), which are also made up of units in R&R and new units being trained in the rear (part of the training of many new units takes place on Ukrainian territory). They don\u2019t include the Rosgvardia grouping deployed in Ukraine, which has grown, according to Mashovets' latest publication, from 28 to 34 thousand men, thanks to the deployment (in the interior of Donetsk Oblast) of the 116th Special Purpose Brigade, the first Rosgvardia\u2019s unit to include a tank unit (likely a company of T-80BVs seized from Wagner Group in the summer). The Rosgvardia also includes Kadyrovites from the 141st Motorized Regiment and Chechen OMON/SOBR units, which are active in the rear. They are not to be confused with members of the \"Akhmat\" detachments, which are under the command of the Ground Forces and made up of contract soldiers from all over Russia.\n\nMoreover, they don\u2019t include the 30k Russian troops deployed along the state border in Bryansk, Kursk and Belgorod Oblasts. Adding them all up, we almost arrive at the figure of 617k troops provided by Putin recently, which also seems to include troops deployed along the state border. There is, however, also a flip-side to Putin's claims: doing some \u201cnapkin\u201d math, if we count the initial invasion force, the reinforcements that arrived in the following months, the D/LPR Armies and their huge number of mobilized men during 2022, the volunteers and PMC members who arrived in 2022, the prisoners from Wagner and then Storm Z/V units, the Russian mobiks and the contract soldiers and volunteers in 2023, I find it very difficult that less than 1,2 if not 1,3 million men have been involved in hostilities for the Russian side over the last two years. The more Medvedev's assertion about half a million contract soldiers during 2023 is true, the greater the implicit Russian losses are, although the figure should include the legalization of former PMC fighters, convicts signing contracts with the MoD and in some cases renewal of contracts of contract soldiers. According to the legal provisions of the partial mobilization law of September 2022, contracts are renewed indefinitely until the end of \"SMO\", but I am aware, for example, that it is possible to sign a 4-months contract in the \"Akhmat\" units, with 1/2-week training (probably for people with minimum military experience). This could be an exception, since when it comes to recruitment Akhmat is still out of MoD management. \n\nIn any case, with an estimate of at least 1,2 million men who fought for Russia and the estimate of about 600k men currently involved, it makes it clear that Russia's \u201cirretrievable\u201d losses are heavy, including dead, wounded who permanently lost combat capabilities, and POWs. In this difference, however, we must add in those who had signed a fixed-term contract and then returned home, PMC fighters who did not sign with the MoD and returned home, Wagner and Storm Z convicts who survived until the end of their terms and were released, new contract soldiers who are currently training in Russia, those who were released for medical and family reasons, some wounded who will be able to regain combat capability but are in rehabilitation, deserters, etc. In any case, to my knowledge the last mobilized (except retired officers) were called up in March 2023, and since then the flow of Russian recruits is driven by contract soldiers, thanks to rising wages and especially financial bonuses, as well as convicts. \n\nThe flow so far has been largely satisfactory from the Russian point of view, and Ukrainian sources estimate the new Russian recruits at 30k men per month over the recent months, more than enough to make up for the losses and also for the creation of the new units. There are indications, however, from both Ukrainian and Russian sources, that the flow of convicts going volunteers has drastically decreased, for obvious reasons. Adding up those recruited by Wagner and the MoD, a significant % of the male prisoners has already gone, and among those who remain there are those who have no intention at all of going, either out of fear or contempt of state authorities. The Russian prisoner population is large, however, and some flow will still be there, but certainly not at the levels of 2023. Let\u2019s recall that in February the contracts of the last wave of convicts recruited by Storm-Z units in August will expire. These contracts used to last 6 months and then convicts would be released. Since then, the convicts are being recruited into Storm-V units whose contracts last until the end of \"SMO\", but the volunteers are much fewer than in the past. This means that many Russian assaults in the recent weeks, whether at Avdiivka, Kupyansk, Kreminna, etc., are carried out mainly by contract soldiers, usually framed in Storm battalions, and the convicts from Storm-Z/V units are employed progressively less - unlike, for example, in the summer, when the Russians on the \u201czero\u201d line in Bakhmut, Kreminna, etc., were overwhelmingly convicts. Today, contract soldiers are the basis for everything: they are used to staff new units, to replenish losses in existing ones, and to fullfil the tasks of mobilized and convicts who become casualties. It\u2019s clear that if during 2024 the flow of contract personnel is no longer sufficient, there could be a new major mobilization wave. \n\nI will now make a focus on the new formations and units created and about to be created by Russia in 2023 and 2024.

This is consistent with the current Russian strategy, with the notable exception of the first part of the Avdiivka offensive, of reducing the use of armored vehicles in large mechanized assaults in favor of Wagner-style infantry attacks, often as reconnaissance in force, where armored vehicles are not always present or mostly play an infantry support role. It\u2019s also consistent with the recent creation of new tank units (as well as artillery ones), while the share of Russian troops within regiments of the Territorial Forces, which are de facto rifle regiments, is gradually declining as a share of total troops deployed.</p>\n\n<p>The numbers don\u2019t include tactical, operational and strategic reserves (60/62 thousand men), which are also made up of units in R&amp;R and new units being trained in the rear (part of the training of many new units takes place on Ukrainian territory). They don\u2019t include the Rosgvardia grouping deployed in Ukraine, which has grown, according to Mashovets&#39; latest publication, from 28 to 34 thousand men, thanks to the deployment (in the interior of Donetsk Oblast) of the 116th Special Purpose Brigade, the first Rosgvardia\u2019s unit to include a tank unit (likely a company of T-80BVs seized from Wagner Group in the summer). The Rosgvardia also includes Kadyrovites from the 141st Motorized Regiment and Chechen OMON/SOBR units, which are active in the rear. They are not to be confused with members of the &quot;Akhmat&quot; detachments, which are under the command of the Ground Forces and made up of contract soldiers from all over Russia.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, they don\u2019t include the 30k Russian troops deployed along the state border in Bryansk, Kursk and Belgorod Oblasts. Adding them all up, we almost arrive at the figure of 617k troops provided by Putin recently, which also seems to include troops deployed along the state border. There is, however, also a flip-side to Putin&#39;s claims: doing some \u201cnapkin\u201d math, if we count the initial invasion force, the reinforcements that arrived in the following months, the D/LPR Armies and their huge number of mobilized men during 2022, the volunteers and PMC members who arrived in 2022, the prisoners from Wagner and then Storm Z/V units, the Russian mobiks and the contract soldiers and volunteers in 2023, I find it very difficult that less than 1,2 if not 1,3 million men have been involved in hostilities for the Russian side over the last two years. The more Medvedev&#39;s assertion about half a million contract soldiers during 2023 is true, the greater the implicit Russian losses are, although the figure should include the legalization of former PMC fighters, convicts signing contracts with the MoD and in some cases renewal of contracts of contract soldiers. According to the legal provisions of the partial mobilization law of September 2022, contracts are renewed indefinitely until the end of &quot;SMO&quot;, but I am aware, for example, that it is possible to sign a 4-months contract in the &quot;Akhmat&quot; units, with 1/2-week training (probably for people with minimum military experience). This could be an exception, since when it comes to recruitment Akhmat is still out of MoD management. </p>\n\n<p>In any case, with an estimate of at least 1,2 million men who fought for Russia and the estimate of about 600k men currently involved, it makes it clear that Russia&#39;s \u201cirretrievable\u201d losses are heavy, including dead, wounded who permanently lost combat capabilities, and POWs. In this difference, however, we must add in those who had signed a fixed-term contract and then returned home, PMC fighters who did not sign with the MoD and returned home, Wagner and Storm Z convicts who survived until the end of their terms and were released, new contract soldiers who are currently training in Russia, those who were released for medical and family reasons, some wounded who will be able to regain combat capability but are in rehabilitation, deserters, etc. In any case, to my knowledge the last mobilized (except retired officers) were called up in March 2023, and since then the flow of Russian recruits is driven by contract soldiers, thanks to rising wages and especially financial bonuses, as well as convicts. </p>\n\n<p>The flow so far has been largely satisfactory from the Russian point of view, and Ukrainian sources estimate the new Russian recruits at 30k men per month over the recent months, more than enough to make up for the losses and also for the creation of the new units. There are indications, however, from both Ukrainian and Russian sources, that the flow of convicts going volunteers has drastically decreased, for obvious reasons. Adding up those recruited by Wagner and the MoD, a significant % of the male prisoners has already gone, and among those who remain there are those who have no intention at all of going, either out of fear or contempt of state authorities. The Russian prisoner population is large, however, and some flow will still be there, but certainly not at the levels of 2023. Let\u2019s recall that in February the contracts of the last wave of convicts recruited by Storm-Z units in August will expire. These contracts used to last 6 months and then convicts would be released. Since then, the convicts are being recruited into Storm-V units whose contracts last until the end of &quot;SMO&quot;, but the volunteers are much fewer than in the past. This means that many Russian assaults in the recent weeks, whether at Avdiivka, Kupyansk, Kreminna, etc., are carried out mainly by contract soldiers, usually framed in Storm battalions, and the convicts from Storm-Z/V units are employed progressively less - unlike, for example, in the summer, when the Russians on the \u201czero\u201d line in Bakhmut, Kreminna, etc., were overwhelmingly convicts. Today, contract soldiers are the basis for everything: they are used to staff new units, to replenish losses in existing ones, and to fullfil the tasks of mobilized and convicts who become casualties. It\u2019s clear that if during 2024 the flow of contract personnel is no longer sufficient, there could be a new major mobilization wave. </p>\n\n<p>I will now make a focus on the new formations and units created and about to be created by Russia in 2023 and 2024.

            "body": "First, as of January 2023, the DPR and LPR Armies became, respectively, the 1st and 2nd Corps of the 8th Army of the Southern Military District, under which they were already subordinate since the 2014/15 Donbas War. The units were rebranded as part of the Russian Army. To give just one example of many cases, the 11th Motorized Regiment of the DPR became the 114th Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps. The 3rd Corps, consisting of the 72nd Motorized Brigade, the 6th Motorized Division, the 17th High Power Artillery Brigade and other supporting units had already been created in the second half of 2022. Its 6th Division should still be incomplete, but it should have integrated within its ranks the 1307th Regiment of the Territorial Forces. This corps should be part of the 20th Army of the WMD, although Russian sources this summer gave it under the SMD, under which command it has always been, both around Bakhmut and Avdiivka. \n\nIt had been announced that the Western Military District would be divided between Moscow MD and Leningrad MD (St. Petersburg). This process should be nearing completion. \n\nWithin the 1st Tank Army of the WMD (soon to be MMD), during 2023 the 47th Tank Division (in 2022 composed only of the 26th Tank Regiment, i.e. the former 6th Tank Brigade from which it was raised in 2021) received the new 245th and 272nd Motorized Regiments as well as the 153rd Tank Regiment. Let\u2019s note the peculiar composition (2 MRRs + 2 TRs), the same as the 150th Division (8th Army, SMD) which, however, is classified as motorized (in Russian jargon, motorized / motor rifle = mechanized).\n\nWithin the 20th Army of the WMD (soon to be MMD), the 362nd Motorized Regiment of the 3rd Motorized Division and the 283rd Motorized Regiment of the 144th Motorized Division were created in 2023, bringing these divisions to the classic 3 MRRs + 1 TR scheme. The 362nd MRR appears to have been created from men of the 1444th Regiment of the Territorial Forces, a battalion of which suffered huge fatalities during the GMLRS attack on Makiivka on New Year's Eve 2022. \n\nShoigu had announced that each CAA would receive an additional reserve rifle regiment, and this seems to be confirmed by Ukrainian sources. Such a regiment has been created in both the 20th Army and the 6th Army of the WMD (soon to be LMD). \n\nWithin the Leningrad MD, Russian intentions are to reform the 11th Corps of the Baltic Fleet and the 14th Corps of the Arctic Fleet into Combined Arms Armies, with the reform of existing brigades into divisions, creation of artillery brigades, etc. Recently, within this framework, coastal troops, i.e. those belonging to the corps of the various fleets, have been taken out of Navy\u2019s command and placed under the Army. This project is more advanced with regard to the 14th Corps, which has already created the 104th Artillery Brigade (which could be soon deployed around Bakhmut). Also, in the LMD, there are plans to establish the 68th and 69th Motorized Divisions, which would already be forming motorized and self-propelled artillery regiments.\n\nMashovets also mentioned the new 44th Corps. This is likely the corps Shoigu was talking about when he announced the creation of a new corps in Karelia and I imagine it will be part of the LMD's new \"Arctic\" CAA. The new 72nd Motorized Division of this corps would be creating its tank regiment. \n\nWithin the Moscow MD, the 34th Artillery Division, the first artillery division of the Russian Army, will be created. It will be made up of the 273rd and 303rd Artillery Brigades. The 42nd Control Brigade and 119th Signal Brigade will also be created, as well as other non-maneuver units such as logistics battalions. \n\nMashovets recently mentioned that along the state border in Belgorod Oblast the new 263rd Motorized Brigade has arrived, in all likelihood part of one of the two MDs created on the basis of the the Western MD.\n\nAs for the Southern Military District, in 2023, the 18th Army was created. This includes the 22nd Corps of the Black Sea Fleet, the 40th Corps, the 70th Motorized Division and the 74th Artillery Brigade (which has yet to be deployed). The 22nd Corps already existed and includes the 126th Coastal Defense Brigade and the 127th Reconnaissance Brigade. The 70th Motorized Division has already been fully deployed in Kherson since August. It consists of the 24th, 26th and 28th Motorized Regiments, the 17th Tank Regiment and the 81st Artillery Regiment. The new 40th Corps is formed by the 144th Motorized Brigade, already in action around Kherson for months, and the 47th Motorized Division, which is being formed in Crimea. Also in Crimea the new 46th Motorized Division and the new 26th Motorized Brigade are being created. These two aforementioned divisions at the moment would have established a motorized regiment.\n\nThe 49th Army has received a reserve rifle regiment. The 19th and 20th Motorized Divisions of, respectively, the 58th and 8th Armies are both creating a separate tank battalion. The latter division in 2023 has also formed the 242nd Motorized Regiment. The 58th Army would have very recently received the 49th Air Assault Brigade. This is a new type of formation, not when it comes to its structure, which I think is comparable to a VDV brigade, but due to the fact that it\u2019s subordinate to a CAA and a military district and not to the VDV, whose formations are much more autonomous and answer directly to the VDV\u2019s command. In my opinion this reflects power struggles within the Russian Armed Forces\u2019 structure and the desire of Shoigu, Gerasimov, Salyukov, Lapin, etc. to limit Teplinsky's power and thus the autonomy of the VDV. Until the end of the Soviet Union, there were air assault brigades under the command of the Ground Forces.\n\nAs for the VDV, the 119th Air Assault Regiment of the 106th VDV Division and the 299th Air Assault Regiment of the 98th VDV Division were created and deployed in 2023. Contrary to initial rumors, these new regiments have mechanized capabilities, being equipped with BMD-2/4s. The 98th and 106th Divisions also received a separate tank battalion and thus became \"heavy\" air assault divisions along the lines of the 76th and 7th VDV Divisions, made up of three AARs + a TB. The 31st VDV Brigade was reformed into the 104th VDV Division, consisting of the 328th, 337th and 345th Air Assault Regiments, the 134th Tank Battalion and the 1180th Artillery Regiment. The VDV also created the 52nd Artillery Brigade, a separate brigade attached directly to the Airborne Forces HQ. It would already have been deployed to Kherson, where the entire new 104th Division is also active. During last summer Russian sources had also written about the creation of five new air assault brigades, but at this point I consider likely that the Ground Forces took over this project and these brigades will be created under the subordination of CAAs. There was no update on the 44th Airborne Division, which was to be formed by units such as the 387th Regiment of the Territorial Forces, which had been trained in the VDV training center in Ryazan. This division probably does not exist, and for that matter has never been mentioned by sources associated with the VDV. The 387th Regiment has always been subordinate to the 7th VDV Division.\n\nWithin the Central MD, the 25th Army was created in 2023. Its subordination to the CMD has never been made official as far as I know, but Ukrainian sources give it under the CMD and for that matter it fights under the Group \"Centre\" in the Kreminna sector, although some sources during the summer gave it under the EMD, in addition to the fact that it received senior and junior officers from the 36th Army of the EMD. It comprises the 67th Motorized Division, the 164th and 169th Motorized Brigades, the 11th Tank Brigade and the 75th Artillery Brigade (the latter has yet to be deployed), as well as other support units. Its 67th Division would be almost entirely deployed around Kreminna and is made up of the 31st, 36th and 37th Motorized Regiments and the 19th Tank Regiment. This CAA represented the largest Russian effort to create new formations during the past year.\n\nThe 2nd Army of the CMD received a reserve rifle regiment. Moreover, there are plans to create the new 27th Motorized Division within this CAA. The 433rd Motorized Regiment of this division would already be in the process of creation. Also, the 137th Motorized Brigade, linked to the CMD and built on the basis of the \"Ural\" Volunteer Battalion (formed in the summer of 2022 in Yekaterinburg) has been deployed in Kreminna. However, it would be under-strength (e.g. it would not have tanks among its equipment).\n\nWithin Eastern MD, the 89th and 94th Motorized Brigades of the 5th Army would be in the stage of formation, in the Russian Far East.\n\nThe 155th Naval Infantry Brigade of the Pacific Fleet has been reformed into the 55th Naval Infantry Division. It would, however, also have been created on the basis of the 336th Naval Infantry Brigade of the Baltic Fleet. I doubt that brigades from different fleets were merged, so perhaps Mashovets meant that officers and NCOs also came from that brigade. Russian sources report that the 177th Regiment of the Caspian Flotilla will be reformed into a brigade. This is not clear to me, because in the Russian order of battle a regiment is roughly equivalent to a brigade. I guess they will probably form 1/2 additional battalions. Final part below.",

                "body": "The composition of the \"Cossack Volunteer Assault Corps\" has been clarified. It\u2019s formed by the union of volunteer units, former PMCs and BARS detachments. It consists of two divisions, which include the so-called \"assault and reconnaissance brigades\u201d, a new type of Russian unit. These brigades are generally reinforced battalions and the battalions that constitute them are reinforced companies, but the total corps size should still be several tens of thousands of men. The former PMCs from which it\u2019s formed come largely from the PMC Redut galaxy and recruitment into them is still done through Redut. \n\nThe first division consists of such assault and reconnaissance brigades: \"Terek\", \"Siberia\", \"Don\u201d, \"Dnepr\u201d, \"Wolves\u201d and \"Convoy\u201d. The last was raised by reforming Rogozin's \"Tsar's Wolves\" Battalion. The second division has such brigades: \"St. George\", \"Nevsky\u201d, \"Veterans\", \"Hispaniola\", \"Sever-V\"; as well as some separate battalions such as \"Storm Ossetia\u201d, \"Alania\", \"Lynx\u201d, \"Torch\u201d, \"Tigers\u201d, \"Borz\u201d, and BARS-8 and BARS-16 detachments. The corps includes the \"Volga\" Artillery Brigade and the \"Oskol\" separate recon battalion. PMC Redut would continue to be active as a brigade-sized unit under the dependencies of this corps. BARS detachments are also part of the brigades - for example, the first and second motorized battalions of the \"Convoy\" Brigade are the former BARS-1 and BARS-11 detachments. The units of this corps are generally motorized with MT-LBs, they also have Tigr MRAPs and BMP-2s. The tank battalions (that some of these brigades have) field tanks such as T-80BV(M)s and these brigades also have tube artillery and rocket artillery battalions within them. Some of such brigades are forming new motorized, rifle and tank battalions. The quality of soldiers is heterogeneous: there are skilled volunteers and former Wagnerites as well as far-right football hooligans, BARS reservists, and ultra-nationalist people who volunteered. In general, the average age of soldiers in the corps is quite high. \n\nSmall focus on Territorial Forces. During the huge wave of mobilization in autumn 2022, Russia had neither the management structures nor the equipment to form new regular divisions and brigades. As a result, the mobiks, in addition to restaffing existing units, were framed into dozens of regiments  of the \"Territorial Forces\", generally of the 3xx-th or 1xxx-th series. These are marked by scarce mechanized capabilities (generally MT-LBs), lack of tank units and often of heavy artillery. They are in fact rifle regiments suitable for defensive purposes and are employed to reinforce the brigades or the divisions to which they are attached. These regiments can be disbanded and cannibalized without problems, unlike regular units. Some of those originally created today no longer exist and have merged into other regiments of the Territorial Forces or regular formations. Some of them have been a basis for creating new regular units too. They are also used as marching units to replenish losses elsewhere. There is evidence that the brigades of the Central Military District deployed around Avdiivka received soldiers from the 1308th Regiment to replenish losses; the 2nd Motorized Division of the 1st Tank Army recently received thousands of soldiers, largely from the 346th Regiment; several motorized brigades of the 2nd Corps have included battalions from the Territorial Forces into their organic structure. Some of these regiments will certainly be retained, as rifle units and/or to include assault troops. For example, the 1307th Regiment replenished the very heavy losses it suffered around Bakhmut with contract soldiers; the 1008th Regiment is looking for contract personnel as stormtroopers; the 1429th and 1430th Regiments, employed in the defense of Robotyne during the summer (where they had very heavy losses), received \"Guards\" status, which suggests that they will be retained and rebuilt. \n\nIn general, Russia is forming many new formations and units. However, one must apply a veil of skepticism to their plans, even if they are confirmed by Ukrainian sources. If forming new brigades has proved relatively easy for them, forming new divisions, particularly from scratch and in the very considerable amount I wrote about above, is by no means a trivial task, even for a country like Russia. For example, the 46th and 47th Motorized Divisions have been in the process of formation since the summer and there has been no update on their progress, according to Mashovets they still have raised only a regiment each. The mobilization support centers (charged with providing weapons and equipment to the new units) are working at full capacity, but there are large bottlenecks. The deadline for the formation of the new units of the Moscow and Leningrad MDs was set for February 29 but for Mashovets it has likely been postponed to May 31, because of the difficulties encountered in establishing them. As far as equipment is concerned, it varies: some new motorized units field BMP-3s, others MT-LBs, and a considerable number of BTR-70s were pulled out of storage. The new tank units often have different tanks: it seems the norm is to have a mix of T-90Ms and T-62Ms, with the bulk of the tanks being made up of the various T-72 modifications, while the availability of T-80s seems to have dropped considerably compared to a year ago, when a large number of T-80BVs were reactivated and given to units in each military district to make up for losses and equip new units.",

But this was a process that really began during the Cold War and reflected German thinking on this idea. Brigade-centric operations focus on battalion task forces as the key unit of maneuver. Battalion task forces can be fast, are easy to command, and are more manpower efficient (you can theoretically get more done with fewer men). But they are also fragile, heavy casualties in even one constituent company can make the organization not work, and they can be equipment intensive as you need more elements in each battalion. In practice the end result is that either you have anemic battalions which will struggle against a resolute enemy to get the job done OR you have Brigades which are basically demi-Divisions and are packed to the gills with equipment, to ensure the battalions do their job right. Conversely divisional structures make the brigade/regiment a key unit of maneuver, battalions are less important. This moves the burden up to a higher ranking (perhaps better trained) officer, makes the unit less casualty sensitive, and concentrates firepower and technology to create more overwhelming fires. But it also is more manpower intensive and typically requires more divisions to cover an area than in a brigade-based structure, where again a brigade acts as almost a light division. In practice divisions almost inevitably also have a ton more firepower and assets they can deploy than a brigade, meaning you can bring more boom to bare IF you have time to get it there. \n\nI think what Ukraine is showing most militaries is that sustainment is more important in peer warfare than mobility. That is, its worth considering how well a division will fight on D+30 or D+90 rather than worrying about winning the war on D+1 or D+2. In the US this tracks well with how the reserve system is integrated as well, with D+90 being the ARNG's focus. In a hypothetical war with say the DPRK the US would deploy most active reserves by D+15 or +30, the next major wave of forces would be the +90 reservists heading over. If you havn't won the war by D+30, very likely forces in the field will need to survive to +90 or +120 to consider a larger operational victory. Which thus means you need a combat org that can go the distance, rather than fall apart after a few dozen casualties.",

The key to successful military operations is to try to mass forces to give yourself the best chance when it comes to force ratios, but we were likely never going to come close to matching the Russians, especially if they launched an invasion without significant prep. The big worry was a limited war where Russia invaded towards the Suwalki Gap, cuts off the Baltics before the US can reinforce Europe and the rest of EU countries in NATO can mobilize, then digs in and tries to end the war as a fat accompli. The NATO forces that were on high readiness were stationed very close to the border, as a deterrence, but the worry was they'd get overrun quickly. \n\nAgain, I didn't create that scenario. I didn't even believe it was legitimate because I'm of the belief that the biggest deterrent stopping a Russian invasion of NATO Europe isn't armored related, it's nukes.

We barely had enough tactical air too, especially the USAF who had closed most of their bases in the 1990s and 2000s and didn&#39;t have a large presence in Europe. </p>\n\n<p>All told we expected to be grossly outnumbered by the Russians if we didn&#39;t have about half a year of warning for an invasion. The key to successful military operations is to try to mass forces to give yourself the best chance when it comes to force ratios, but we were likely never going to come close to matching the Russians, especially if they launched an invasion without significant prep. The big worry was a limited war where Russia invaded towards the Suwalki Gap, cuts off the Baltics before the US can reinforce Europe and the rest of EU countries in NATO can mobilize, then digs in and tries to end the war as a fat accompli. The NATO forces that were on high readiness were stationed very close to the border, as a deterrence, but the worry was they&#39;d get overrun quickly. </p>\n\n<p>Again, I didn&#39;t create that scenario. I didn&#39;t even believe it was legitimate because I&#39;m of the belief that the biggest deterrent stopping a Russian invasion of NATO Europe isn&#39;t armored related, it&#39;s nukes. But that&#39;s the scenario much of NATO, especially those in ground warfare specialties were stressing about before the Russo Ukraine War started.</p>\n</div>",

                "body": "Russia is 100% not getting stronger. It is extremely atypical for an Army, once locked into a war, to get stronger over time. Really that only happens in mass mobilization periods, which Russia is not doing. Instead, the war between the two can be thought of like a wrestling or boxing match. Both combatants are slowly wearing themselves out. Taking blows, losing men, losing equipment. Eventually one side or another will hit the bottom of the barrel and either break or quit. What were seeing now is the Russia is not tiring as quickly as western analysts predicted, and is rather able to maintain and sustain a high level of effective commitment to the front. This comes at a cost, and wont last forever. An example of this is the Storm-Z/V units, which were initially a good source of manpower but one that has now seem to have been exhausted. Russia can keep mining for more men, just as UKR changes and expands its own conscription scheme. Eventually both will run out of willing and able young men to go, but the question is whose society can better bare that burden. Ditto, for example, with equipment. Russia's tank numbers are increasing, and its rate of production on tanks is much higher than expected. But some number of those vehicles are going to be stuff like the MTLBs with naval guns and T-62 obr. 2022s. These are obvious downgrades vs. T-80s and T-72B3s. But Ukraine is also going through its own downgrade, as T-72s and -64s are swapped for things like Leo 1s and older model import Soviet tanks. Within the perspective of the war, were looking at how these changes create relative imbalance between the two forces. But within a larger context, only a fucking idiot would send a battalion of T-62 obr. 2022s against an Abrams battalion. The US does not have shell hunger, its not running low on Patriot missiles, its Air Force is intact, its fresh. Russia has not degraded in Ukraine as we expected, but the west and NATO has not been fighting at all and is thus in a much better material state. Thus Russia very well likely may need a number of years before it can, say, replace its T-62s with T-90s and -14s. Or upgrade its IFV fleet to the BMP-3 standard.

                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Russia is 100% not getting stronger. It is extremely atypical for an Army, once locked into a war, to get stronger over time. Really that only happens in mass mobilization periods, which Russia is not doing. Instead, the war between the two can be thought of like a wrestling or boxing match. Both combatants are slowly wearing themselves out. Taking blows, losing men, losing equipment. Eventually one side or another will hit the bottom of the barrel and either break or quit. What were seeing now is the Russia is not tiring as quickly as western analysts predicted, and is rather able to maintain and sustain a high level of effective commitment to the front. This comes at a cost, and wont last forever. An example of this is the Storm-Z/V units, which were initially a good source of manpower but one that has now seem to have been exhausted. Russia can keep mining for more men, just as UKR changes and expands its own conscription scheme. Eventually both will run out of willing and able young men to go, but the question is whose society can better bare that burden. Ditto, for example, with equipment. Russia&#39;s tank numbers are increasing, and its rate of production on tanks is much higher than expected. But some number of those vehicles are going to be stuff like the MTLBs with naval guns and T-62 obr. 2022s. These are obvious downgrades vs. T-80s and T-72B3s. But Ukraine is also going through its own downgrade, as T-72s and -64s are swapped for things like Leo 1s and older model import Soviet tanks. Within the perspective of the war, were looking at how these changes create relative imbalance between the two forces. But within a larger context, only a fucking idiot would send a battalion of T-62 obr. 2022s against an Abrams battalion. The US does not have shell hunger, its not running low on Patriot missiles, its Air Force is intact, its fresh. Russia has not degraded in Ukraine as we expected, but the west and NATO has not been fighting at all and is thus in a much better material state. Thus Russia very well likely may need a number of years before it can, say, replace its T-62s with T-90s and -14s. Or upgrade its IFV fleet to the BMP-3 standard. Or replace its missile stockpile for theater level strikes. Just like you wouldn&#39;t pit an exhausted Muhammad Ali against a fresh Mike Tyson, you cant expect an exhausted Russian army to credibly threaten NATO until its had time to regenerate seriously.</p>\n</div>",

Democrat voters are in fact far less critical and far more accommodating than Republican voters. American voters, in general, are so easy to placate with wedge issues and &quot;look at the other guy&quot; that you need decades of misconduct before they start refusing to vote.\u00a0</p>\n</div>",

Especially when they already feel like their opinion doesn&#39;t matter.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The young vote might be historically fickle, and yet it&#39;s when it does turn out that Democrats win - without the young vote, Biden has no path to victory.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>There are a lot of Jewish voters in the US, yes. There are more people between the ages of 18-34 though, and not every Jew in the US is a zionist single-issue voter - its a fact that many voted for Obama, despite him being far more hostile to Israel in his campaign than any other president in a long while. The biggest zionist voter block isn&#39;t the Jewish block, it&#39;s the Evangelicals.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, there is also the Arab/Muslim American vote. There are about 5 million Americans which are either Arab, or come from another majority Muslim country. These are going to also be strongly anti zionist, and must be balanced against the Jewish demographic when looking at the vote. On the balance, the democratic base simply isn&#39;t Zionist. The numbers just don&#39;t add to be argue that Democrats would lose votes by being less pro-Israel.</p>\n</div>",

The US kept changing its mind about whether it wanted a high-flying bomber while others wanted a fast low-flying supersonic bomber.  This was due to new developments such as SAMs capable of reaching high altitudes, ICBMs, and needing something that could be fast to use terrain masking (something the XB-70 couldn't do) and have great range as a bomber (something the F-111 couldn't do).  \n\nThen once again the discovery of the Mig31's look-down radar made detection at low altitudes highly probable essentially making the B1B nearly as survivable as a B52.  With a series of political whiplashes of funding and cancellations, the development of cruise missiles, even longer-range AA missiles like the Axehead fired from the Mig31, the Bone was considered the cheapest program to cover a gap in capability between the B52's effectiveness sunset, and the stealth bomber program on mission readiness.  \n\nThus became the Bone after a final redesign to try to adapt it to the current mission set.  So think of the B-1B as an adapted and modified platform as a response to many years of changes in the threat space and predicted battlefield outcomes, rather than a \"wasn't this designed for x\" frame of mind.\n\nWhy the Bone would be used over other platforms has a few possible reasons.  \n\n* One, there would be very little early warning of these strikes from aircraft taking off and flying to the Middle East compared to sorties of fighter aircraft in the region (whether land or sea-based).  Despite talk around \"did they know they were going to be hit\", ultimately you can't really know where it might be coming from if a couple of planes fly in from overseas compared to radars and visible observers seeing sorties being flow many times for the level of strikes conducted.\n\n* Two, if you have tons of fighter aircraft launching these strikes, should something happen you have fewer aircraft that can respond quickly.\n\n* Three, threat to lives the more aircraft involved the more pilots are at risk, and fewer aircraft, fewer pilots and airframes could be lost.\n\n* Four, mission training, this is exactly the sort of mission training the B-1B's pilots are trained for and it isn't to say F/A-18 pilots don't train for this.  However, the fewer mission sets you to train for mean you are more capable in those ones you do.  For example, despite the Air Force saying the F35's capability could provide CAS, to date no F35 pilots are doing CAS training.  A-10 pilots trained specifically for that (and I think Search and Rescue) are always going to be better at CAS even if F35 pilots started training for it, regardless of platform differences.\n\n* Five, given the above points you have 3 aircraft to generally choose from, the B2, B52, and B-1B.  The B2 has twice the operational cost of the B52 and the B1-B is another 13% savings over the B52 while being more capable for this mission.",

            "body": "Urban terrain is more of a defenders advantage. That is, it is an advantage to whoever is not moving. Units, infantry or armor, advancing through urban terrain have narrow sight lines, confront unique geography nearly every block, and have a multidimensional threat to deal with. That is, snipers on roofs, infantry in buildings, ambushers on street level, and even teams in the sewers if theyre big enough. The attacker does have some advantages, and can turn the tables if theyre clever. But overwhelmingly the advantage goes to the static side.

It is unclear if the October 7th attacks were supposed to be the starting gun for such a multi-front attack. I tend to believe yes, if consider the initial statements by Hamas leaders about the Arab world rising up.

The same al-Radwan Force that has been releasing training videos for infiltrations that mimic what Hamas had been releasing before their attack. Before Israel considered that Hezbollah was also deterred. Now they have to consider that instead of occasionally trading missiles, Hezbollah could launch an all-out-assault with their thousands of missiles and infiltrate the Israeli border to commit massacres. In such a scenario, likely tens of thousands of Israelis would perish. This is not acceptable. \n\nRegardless of what happens, Hezbollah will be pushed off the border either diplomatically or militarily. If there is a ceasefire, I am not convinced Israel will launch such an assault. I think they will wait until after the American elections even if the diplomatic route fails, but it is a matter of when and not if in such a case.",

The same al-Radwan Force that has been releasing training videos for infiltrations that mimic what Hamas had been releasing before their attack. Before Israel considered that Hezbollah was also deterred. Now they have to consider that instead of occasionally trading missiles, Hezbollah could launch an all-out-assault with their thousands of missiles and infiltrate the Israeli border to commit massacres. In such a scenario, likely tens of thousands of Israelis would perish. This is not acceptable. </p>\n\n<p>Regardless of what happens, Hezbollah will be pushed off the border either diplomatically or militarily. If there is a ceasefire, I am not convinced Israel will launch such an assault. I think they will wait until after the American elections even if the diplomatic route fails, but it is a matter of when and not if in such a case.</p>\n</div>",

The paper is obviously focused on defence and not broader British and Irish politics, so I understand why it doesn\u2019t go into a whole load of detail about means to convince the people of Northern Ireland that they\u2019re better off with the UK. But you can\u2019t just say \u201cthe question should be taken off the table\u201d without at least elaborating some vague sense of how that could be achieved, since it\u2019s a bit of a load bearing statement. Like, at least say \u201cwe need to find ways to convince people to not want to leave the UK\u201d, in which case: good luck solving the central question of the unionist movement here for the last few decades! </p>\n\n<p>I can\u2019t really pick holes at the paper and I\u2019m not interested in doing that, but I think it\u2019s really just gliding past the gigantic sword of Damocles that will hang over literally any attempt to build new bases and infrastructure in NI, which is that everyone will ask \u201cwhy are we doing this if the base <em>could</em> be Irish in a few years time\u201d.</p>\n</div>",
