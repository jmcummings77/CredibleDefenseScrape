      "selftext": "The r/CredibleDefense daily megathread is for asking questions and posting submissions that would not fit the criteria of our post submissions. As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster. Don't abuse it though! If something is not obviously against the rules but you still feel that it should be reviewed, leave a short but descriptive comment while filing the report.",

However, I always try to double-check my facts, and this time it was challenging due to various claims being made.

I looked into it and was able to gather the following information from official primary sources:\r  \n\r  \nOn April 16th, drones were launched, which was confirmed by Ukraine's border guard who posted a downed drone on their Telegram channel. The next day, explosions were reported in Slovyansk, and later the city's military administration confirmed that Shahed drones were used in the attack on Telegram. However, neither of these attacks was reported by the Air Force of Ukraine.\r  \n\r  \nOn April 19th, two different strikes were launched.

        "body": "Hi! I don't really know anything about defense, so sorry if this is all stupid for some obvious reason, but I was genuinely curious to hear from people who know more.\n\nLast month I saw a number of stories about how the US is trying to fit AIM-120 missiles to Mig-29s (this came from Department of Defense sources). On paper, it seems like this would help solve a lot of Ukraine's problems, but comes with issues (mostly that it probably isn't feasible). I've not seen a lot of discussion over this following the recent leaks about air defense shortages, and was curious to see if people had more information on feasibility. Here are the benefits as I understand:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Ukraine has a decent number of Mig-29s (whatever is left of the original fleet, plus about 20 being delivered from Poland, plus 13 from Slovakia)\n* Ukraine already has the capabilities in terms of pilot training, airport facilities, etc. They've been operating Mig-29s for over a year now, which suggests the Russians are not that good at destroying them on the ground\n* AIM-120 has a range of 50-160 km depending on the variant, and a speed of around Mach 4. At the lower end that seems enough to operate within Ukraine and safely target cruise missiles (I remember a while ago a Ukrainian Mig-29 crashed because it had to use a short range missile to lock onto a cruise missile, and the debris damaged the engine). At the higher end that could be enough to start contesting the border area with Russian aircraft?\n* Ukrainian pilots keep complaining that they don't have any longer range air to air missiles, which limits their ability to intercept cruise missiles. They're trying to do it anyway ([https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-europe-63465297](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-europe-63465297)), and this would significantly boost their capabilities\n* There is a large number of AIM-120 produced. It's not cutting edge as we are replacing it with AIM-260, and we've already given the Ukrainians AIM-120 for NASSAMS. So technology secrecy shouldn't be much of an issue?\n* Delivering more AIM-120s won't generate much news, whereas an eventual decision over the transfer of F-16s or other Western fighters also entails political and diplomatic considerations\n* The issues I can see: a) Aim-120 on a Mig-29 won't intercept a ballistic missile, and b) the future supply of Mig-29s to Ukraine after the Poland/Slovakia transfer will be very limited (not many friendly operators left). I don't think a) matters that much, as a lot of Ukraine's existing air defense can't handle ballistic missiles either- by providing an additional platform to take out cruise missiles, Aim-120 relieves pressure on those that can (e.g. PAC-3). b) Seems a big concern, but I don't know what the loss rate of Mig-29s is/how long the new Mig-29s are expected to last\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI read ([https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/arming-ukrainian-fighters-with-aim-120-missiles-is-a-complex-proposition](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/arming-ukrainian-fighters-with-aim-120-missiles-is-a-complex-proposition)), which emphasizes a lot of the technical issues in actually doing this- basically the Mig-29s do not have good enough radar to guide the missile for a long distance lock, and they are also not set up to communicate with Western missiles.\n\nThe article mentions two possible workarounds:\n\n1. Replace the Mig-29 radars with a Western one. The article says, 'This would require a new cockpit display and interface and wiring, but it could be done. Time would be a major factor here, but if Ukraine is years away from a western fighter, then this may be a prudent move.' Is this correct? It seems like this would be a very major overhaul of the Mig-29s, which would not be of use any time soon?\n2. Use third-party data, e.g. guidance from NASSAMs radar, while using the Mig-29 just as the launch platform. The article argues, 'Still, this seems highly unlikely to be the case and a significant interface would still need to exist in the cockpit. Also, this would include more technologically sensitive versions of the AMRAAM.' What I don't understand is why would the AIM-120s be more technologically sensitive if this was done? And how major would changes to the cockpit of the Mig-29 have to be?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWould it be feasible for the Mig-29s to just carry the missile to the right location, and everything else (apart from the physical launch) to be done from the ground?\n\nOh and final question- do we know if either the Polish and Slovakian Mig-29s were ever upgraded in any way that would make compatibility with AIM-120 easier?\n\nIt does seem like it's a challenging modification, but HARMS on Soviet jet were also considered unlikely for a while",

The article argues, &#39;Still, this seems highly unlikely to be the case and a significant interface would still need to exist in the cockpit. Also, this would include more technologically sensitive versions of the AMRAAM.&#39; What I don&#39;t understand is why would the AIM-120s be more technologically sensitive if this was done? And how major would changes to the cockpit of the Mig-29 have to be?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Would it be feasible for the Mig-29s to just carry the missile to the right location, and everything else (apart from the physical launch) to be done from the ground?</p>\n\n<p>Oh and final question- do we know if either the Polish and Slovakian Mig-29s were ever upgraded in any way that would make compatibility with AIM-120 easier?</p>\n\n<p>It does seem like it&#39;s a challenging modification, but HARMS on Soviet jet were also considered unlikely for a while</p>\n</div>",

US infantry Combined Arms Battalions in ABCTs have two or three mechanized rifle companies in IFVs (maybe two when deployed OCONUS, not sure what the on-the-ground reality for this is anymore, since the US hasn't really deployed mechanized infantry en masse in a while, but in any case Australia has three rifle companies per mechanized battalion), each of which has approximately 15 IFVs. That's 12 Brads as part of the primary maneuver platoons plus HQ and support elements that may use Brad variants (e.g. M3 for scout platoons) or M113s (e.g., medevac, now being replaced by the AMPV in the US). The M113 is the system the Australians are seeking to replace, so seems fair to include in the total count alongside the Bradleys. So that's 45 IFVs for the maneuver companies in the battalion. Plus there's the battalion HQ company and often a weapons company, although at least in the US Army I don't think the weapons companies typically are equipped with IFVs. But the HQ elements in a US ABCT infantry CAB have around 24 IFVs.\n\nSo that's 69 IFVs total per battalion. Meaning 129 would not quite be sufficient for two battalions.

            "body": "IMO hopes for de-dollarization were dashed at the outbreak of the war, and Russia & China have been seething about it ever since.\n\nPrior to the outbreak of the war, de-dollarization was different than how it's presented now; it effectively came down to replacing the dollar with the Euro. While the Euro is not as strong as a currency as the USD, it was the best alternative, and at least blunts US actions aimed at weaponizing the dollar. [Before the war, Russia-China settlements were quickly switching to the Euro.](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/econographics/russia-and-china-partners-in-dedollarization/) IMO, it was part of a wider scheme by both China and Russia to widen a transatlantic schism and/or utilitize Europe's relative dovishness to insulate them from harm.\n\nThe problem with this is that Russia then basically demanded eastern Europe to become its sphere of influence once again, and then invaded Ukraine.
