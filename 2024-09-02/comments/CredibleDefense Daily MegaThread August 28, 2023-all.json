Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

        "body": "u/Health-Vacation-306 [asked a question in the MegaThread yesterday about the Air Force pilot shortage](https://old.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/162okwr/credibledefense_daily_megathread_august_27_2023/jy1mgff/) and I didn't get a chance to respond there, but this is a much bigger issue than is being let on (as it is [a Navy](https://aviationweek.com/defense-space/light-attack-advanced-training/us-services-overhaul-pilot-training-long-term-problems) and [Marine Corps](https://taskandpurpose.com/news/marine-corps-pilot-retention/) issue) as well, so I thought it would be worth discussing this in the new daily thread\n\nHis original post wrote:\n\n>Can someone explain to me what the U.S. Air Force's pilot shortage is actually about? I keep hearing it's a huge problem but it doesn't seem to be?\n\n>https://www.airforcetimes.com/news/your-air-force/2023/06/08/can-this-internal-review-help-shrink-the-air-forces-pilot-shortage/\n\n>>At the start of fiscal 2023 last October, the Air Force stood around 700 pilots short of its 13,000-person active duty goal, and around 1,200 pilots short of the 8,000 it needed across the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve.\n\n>>Overall, the Air Force\u2019s pilot workforce is around 91% staffed. While combat flying units have all the aviators they need, Brown said, three in 10 policy jobs sit empty because the service doesn\u2019t have enough pilots to fill them.\n\n>>In some cases, it\u2019s because having a pilot in the seat has become the norm.\n\n>>\u201cYou had a pilot come into that job, you liked it, and you said, \u2018From here on out, I need to have that,\u2019\u201d Brown said. \u201cThat\u2019s not necessarily the case.\u201d\n\n>700 pilots out of 13,000 seems to not be very many, and the gaps all being policy positions seems even less urgent? Like it's suboptimal, but I keep hearing people saying the Air Force needs to do this or that drastic change to QoL to retain pilots and it doesn't seem entirely necessary, especially when the gap is significantly higher in the Guard and Reserves, where the QoL issues are much, much smaller. I also don't really get why having x number of O-5 or O-6 pilots is so important to begin with. What am I missing?\n\nFull disclaimer: I am in this field and know lots of pilots across all 3 branches. The retention issue is a massive problem that has gotten worse in recent years\n\nFirst of all, look at those Navy numbers: they said they were short about 100 fighter pilots. The big key a lot of people miss is WHERE they were short - is that 100 fighter pilots short of the ~500 operational pilots required for operational/deploying forces? Now THAT is a big difference. [The Navy as a whole was already short 1,242 aviators in 2018 with retention rates worse than the historical 10-year average](https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2020/march/sound-leadership-can-help-solve-naval-aviations-retention-crisis) and while COVID reversed the retention problem for a couple years, it has come right back.\n\nThe Air Force is a bit more open about where its billets are gapped (in staff jobs), but all the branches are doing the same thing: they are prioritizing operational billets at the expense of all the other billets that make the branches work, resulting in increased burnout (and thus decreasing retention rates) and a loss of soon-to-be senior leadership/experience\n\nFor instance, that USNI article was written by a Naval Aviator, and he sums it up perfectly from a JO's perspective:\n\n>The strike fighter community has been especially affected by low retention rates among midgrade officers and, as a result, the Navy has been forced to reduce the number of screened department head billets for each of its F/A-18E squadrons by 25 percent. This is especially problematic when coupled with other manning shortfalls. For example, more than 1 of every 4 first-tour strike fighter pilot billets is unfilled, according to a recent Government Accountability Office report. These have combined to put the readiness of operational squadrons at risk and fatigued a highly specialized yet limited workforce. \n\nTo give everyone more of a background, for all 3 branches, you start your career as a pilot in flight school. Air Force UPT takes about 1 year then has a 10-year commitment post wings. Navy/Marine Corps flight school takes on average 1.5-3 years (faster if helos/big wing, longer if jets) with an 8-year commitment.\n\nAs a result, everyone roughly faces a career crossroads around the 10-11 year mark: right as you put on O-4 and right as you are ready to take on increased responsibilities in operational forces. \n\nAll the branches work on a similar career model: post winging, you are expected to go to your B-Course/fleet replacement squadron to learn the fundamentals of flying your operational airframe. That can take 4-12 months. Then you are expected to do an operational/deployable tour in an operational fleet squadron. Historically, the norm was about 3 years there.\n\nThen you get rotated to some sort of training/production gig. Could be flight school, go be as an IP at a replacement squadron, get a weapons school patch and go be a tactics instructor, etc. You basically are training the people that will be replacing you in the fleet in a few years, or will be the senior O-3s in your operational squadrons when you return.\n\nThat's also supposed to be your tour that you get to spend more time at home since you are in a non-deployable squadron. You don't go on the road for work-ups for deployments, don't deploy, etc. In theory, your hours are much more relaxed as you don't need to face operational necessity.\n\nThe key to note here is that this is almost always a flying tour (you're paying back for the training and experience the branches gave you) unless you royally fucked up or are medically DQ'd or something.\n\nTowards the last 2-4 years of your commitment, depending on timing and other factors, you might get rotated back to another deployable tour as a senior O-3/about to be O-4. Navy/Marines/Air Force differ a lot here on what they do, an this is also where your first non-flying tours might start showing up (e.g., General's Exec for AF, Catapult Officer for Navy, FAC for Marines, etc.)\n\nNow, what is the retention problem causing?\n\nYou'll note that in Gen. Brown's comments, he said operational billets are filled. The gaps are primarily coming in policy/staff gigs.\n\nAnd if you read the articles above about Navy retention, you'll see similar trends: they're short on pilots, so they fill deploying squadrons via various means like temporarily moving existing pilots around from non-deployed squadrons to deploying squadrons, rotate people back out of training commands faster to the fleet to fill mid-level roles before they get out, etc.\n\nEnd result? Your operational forces are filled (as Gen. Brown hinted at), but you start losing pilots in production jobs and those future policy/staff tours lose bodies, which Gen. Brown mentioned 3/10 are unfilled. The Air Force, like the Navy/Marines, are prioritizing production over staff/policy tours because you need to keep producing pilots or else you have no one to fill your jobs in the future.\n\nSee where the problem is? Retention of those pilots, which is in part perpetuated by the fact that pilots are rotated back/kept in operational billets longer/more frequently which burns them out and has them headed for flying the friendly skies.\n\nAs an example of this, a family friend of mine who also went into the business in recent years did 2 deployments in his 4-year operational tour (he was extended due to shortage of incoming pilots) totaling over 16 months away from home. Before each deployment, he totaled about 7 months away from home due to workups. All told, he calculated he was away from home 30 months - 2.5 total years - out of his 4 years. \n\nHe was also single, so not the end of the world, but for guys/gals with families? Young kids? \n\nNow, he then went to a production tour afterwards at a fleet replacement squadron, and they were in a crunch/transition period, and were being asked to make up for production losses by working longer hours and go on more training detachments (i.e., time away from home). His senior IPs at his squadron were being pulled within 2 years back to the fleet to fill operational billets because not enough aviators were sticking around for their O-4 tours - meaning more time away from home, again.\n\nSee how the problem starts snowballing?

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"/u/Health-Vacation-306\">u/Health-Vacation-306</a> <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/162okwr/credibledefense_daily_megathread_august_27_2023/jy1mgff/\">asked a question in the MegaThread yesterday about the Air Force pilot shortage</a> and I didn&#39;t get a chance to respond there, but this is a much bigger issue than is being let on (as it is <a href=\"https://aviationweek.com/defense-space/light-attack-advanced-training/us-services-overhaul-pilot-training-long-term-problems\">a Navy</a> and <a href=\"https://taskandpurpose.com/news/marine-corps-pilot-retention/\">Marine Corps</a> issue) as well, so I thought it would be worth discussing this in the new daily thread</p>\n\n<p>His original post wrote:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Can someone explain to me what the U.S. Air Force&#39;s pilot shortage is actually about? I keep hearing it&#39;s a huge problem but it doesn&#39;t seem to be?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.airforcetimes.com/news/your-air-force/2023/06/08/can-this-internal-review-help-shrink-the-air-forces-pilot-shortage/\">https://www.airforcetimes.com/news/your-air-force/2023/06/08/can-this-internal-review-help-shrink-the-air-forces-pilot-shortage/</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>At the start of fiscal 2023 last October, the Air Force stood around 700 pilots short of its 13,000-person active duty goal, and around 1,200 pilots short of the 8,000 it needed across the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, the Air Force\u2019s pilot workforce is around 91% staffed. While combat flying units have all the aviators they need, Brown said, three in 10 policy jobs sit empty because the service doesn\u2019t have enough pilots to fill them.</p>\n\n<p>In some cases, it\u2019s because having a pilot in the seat has become the norm.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYou had a pilot come into that job, you liked it, and you said, \u2018From here on out, I need to have that,\u2019\u201d Brown said. \u201cThat\u2019s not necessarily the case.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>700 pilots out of 13,000 seems to not be very many, and the gaps all being policy positions seems even less urgent? Like it&#39;s suboptimal, but I keep hearing people saying the Air Force needs to do this or that drastic change to QoL to retain pilots and it doesn&#39;t seem entirely necessary, especially when the gap is significantly higher in the Guard and Reserves, where the QoL issues are much, much smaller. I also don&#39;t really get why having x number of O-5 or O-6 pilots is so important to begin with. What am I missing?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Full disclaimer: I am in this field and know lots of pilots across all 3 branches. The retention issue is a massive problem that has gotten worse in recent years</p>\n\n<p>First of all, look at those Navy numbers: they said they were short about 100 fighter pilots. The big key a lot of people miss is WHERE they were short - is that 100 fighter pilots short of the ~500 operational pilots required for operational/deploying forces? Now THAT is a big difference. <a href=\"https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2020/march/sound-leadership-can-help-solve-naval-aviations-retention-crisis\">The Navy as a whole was already short 1,242 aviators in 2018 with retention rates worse than the historical 10-year average</a> and while COVID reversed the retention problem for a couple years, it has come right back.</p>\n\n<p>The Air Force is a bit more open about where its billets are gapped (in staff jobs), but all the branches are doing the same thing: they are prioritizing operational billets at the expense of all the other billets that make the branches work, resulting in increased burnout (and thus decreasing retention rates) and a loss of soon-to-be senior leadership/experience</p>\n\n<p>For instance, that USNI article was written by a Naval Aviator, and he sums it up perfectly from a JO&#39;s perspective:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The strike fighter community has been especially affected by low retention rates among midgrade officers and, as a result, the Navy has been forced to reduce the number of screened department head billets for each of its F/A-18E squadrons by 25 percent. This is especially problematic when coupled with other manning shortfalls. For example, more than 1 of every 4 first-tour strike fighter pilot billets is unfilled, according to a recent Government Accountability Office report. These have combined to put the readiness of operational squadrons at risk and fatigued a highly specialized yet limited workforce. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To give everyone more of a background, for all 3 branches, you start your career as a pilot in flight school. Air Force UPT takes about 1 year then has a 10-year commitment post wings. Navy/Marine Corps flight school takes on average 1.5-3 years (faster if helos/big wing, longer if jets) with an 8-year commitment.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, everyone roughly faces a career crossroads around the 10-11 year mark: right as you put on O-4 and right as you are ready to take on increased responsibilities in operational forces. </p>\n\n<p>All the branches work on a similar career model: post winging, you are expected to go to your B-Course/fleet replacement squadron to learn the fundamentals of flying your operational airframe. That can take 4-12 months. Then you are expected to do an operational/deployable tour in an operational fleet squadron. Historically, the norm was about 3 years there.</p>\n\n<p>Then you get rotated to some sort of training/production gig. Could be flight school, go be as an IP at a replacement squadron, get a weapons school patch and go be a tactics instructor, etc. You basically are training the people that will be replacing you in the fleet in a few years, or will be the senior O-3s in your operational squadrons when you return.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s also supposed to be your tour that you get to spend more time at home since you are in a non-deployable squadron. You don&#39;t go on the road for work-ups for deployments, don&#39;t deploy, etc. In theory, your hours are much more relaxed as you don&#39;t need to face operational necessity.</p>\n\n<p>The key to note here is that this is almost always a flying tour (you&#39;re paying back for the training and experience the branches gave you) unless you royally fucked up or are medically DQ&#39;d or something.</p>\n\n<p>Towards the last 2-4 years of your commitment, depending on timing and other factors, you might get rotated back to another deployable tour as a senior O-3/about to be O-4. Navy/Marines/Air Force differ a lot here on what they do, an this is also where your first non-flying tours might start showing up (e.g., General&#39;s Exec for AF, Catapult Officer for Navy, FAC for Marines, etc.)</p>\n\n<p>Now, what is the retention problem causing?</p>\n\n<p>You&#39;ll note that in Gen. Brown&#39;s comments, he said operational billets are filled. The gaps are primarily coming in policy/staff gigs.</p>\n\n<p>And if you read the articles above about Navy retention, you&#39;ll see similar trends: they&#39;re short on pilots, so they fill deploying squadrons via various means like temporarily moving existing pilots around from non-deployed squadrons to deploying squadrons, rotate people back out of training commands faster to the fleet to fill mid-level roles before they get out, etc.</p>\n\n<p>End result? Your operational forces are filled (as Gen. Brown hinted at), but you start losing pilots in production jobs and those future policy/staff tours lose bodies, which Gen. Brown mentioned 3/10 are unfilled. The Air Force, like the Navy/Marines, are prioritizing production over staff/policy tours because you need to keep producing pilots or else you have no one to fill your jobs in the future.</p>\n\n<p>See where the problem is? Retention of those pilots, which is in part perpetuated by the fact that pilots are rotated back/kept in operational billets longer/more frequently which burns them out and has them headed for flying the friendly skies.</p>\n\n<p>As an example of this, a family friend of mine who also went into the business in recent years did 2 deployments in his 4-year operational tour (he was extended due to shortage of incoming pilots) totaling over 16 months away from home. Before each deployment, he totaled about 7 months away from home due to workups. All told, he calculated he was away from home 30 months - 2.5 total years - out of his 4 years. </p>\n\n<p>He was also single, so not the end of the world, but for guys/gals with families? Young kids? </p>\n\n<p>Now, he then went to a production tour afterwards at a fleet replacement squadron, and they were in a crunch/transition period, and were being asked to make up for production losses by working longer hours and go on more training detachments (i.e., time away from home). His senior IPs at his squadron were being pulled within 2 years back to the fleet to fill operational billets because not enough aviators were sticking around for their O-4 tours - meaning more time away from home, again.</p>\n\n<p>See how the problem starts snowballing?

Coupled with recent production problems, and the problem is going to get worse as you have fewer bodies even eligible to fill those jobs going forward.\n\nDon't get me wrong - you will always have people get out. You will never retain 100% of your pilots. The airlines can and will always offer you more money than your O-4/O-5/O-6 salaries + all the Congressionally-authorized bonuses will be able to compete with. And airlines will never see you deploy to bum-fuck-istan or some boat for most of a year.\n\nBut let's talk about what the DOD is losing:\n\n* Experience, money, and time that can never be recovered. Those 3+ years in an operational tour, plus the 1-3 years of flight school training, and the upwards of a year of replacement squadron training, is years of effort (and over a thousand flight hours, and millions of dollars) that will not be usable by the DOD again. During your operational tour, you are as proficient as you will ever be in your airfame, getting all of your quals. All that goes away when someone elects to get out.\n* That experience loss means less experience at the mid-level and senior pilot level within operational squadrons. These are the guys training your FNGs and getting them their quals. These are your guys providing mentorship/leadership on your O-2 and O-3s. These are your examples your junior officers follow. On a practical level too, your O-4s and above are supposed to get your more advanced quals, like Strike Leads/Strike Mission commanders - you know, how we'd actually fight a major war. \n* That experience issue then propagates to loss of future experience at the O-4 and above level. You need bodies that have lots of experience to do a post O-4 or O-5 operational tour in production/training, or go to staff gigs to help do policy, acquisitions, or even tactical development. For instance, there are O-4 and even O-5 positions on Top Gun's staff, which is considered a shore tour (non deployable job). When people, even Top Gun grads, are getting out, you start losing dudes whose jobs it is to develop future tactics. Those guys are already overtasked as is, and falling numbers just drive more to the door and it means less frequent or less quality of products can get put out.\n* Those staff gigs - like on a COCOM staff - means you have fewer aviators advising the combatant commanders, who may not be aviators. Ideally, your air component commander covers that, but that's not always sufficient to get the right/aviator-focused knowledge to the right decision makers. An example of this is that in the Air Force, the pilot shortage is primarily impacting the fighter communities. Fewer pointy-nosed guys in staff gigs means fewer fighter voices which can lead to a lot of erroneous assumptions on what fighters can do/need when it comes time to writing an Air Tasking Order for the day for a COCOM. That all impacts operational deployed forces. Being a pilot doesn't mean you have the same background, and as they start running into problems manning staff/billet jobs, they're going to inevitably put people in a position where they may be very well intentioned and hardworking but won't have the breadth or depth of experience required due to slim pickings.\n* The loss of large quantities of qualified people also means you get survivorship bias, and those who stick around are those who want to stick around. Leadership starts getting worse because it's less about competition on who is really a better leader for a leadership job, and more about who is remaining. This becomes a problem then as retention starts hurting too, because people distrust/don't like/hate poor leadership. See how the snowball rapidly grows as it rolls downhill?\n* All fields feel this hit. Fewer aviators in acquisitions tours means you have fewer aircrew helping decide what gets procured. Imagine an engineer with minimal aviation experience writing the requirements on the next generation fighter. Oof. Those staff/policy pilots get ignored at long-term peril.\n* Hell, the Marines had announced in the past [Master Aviation Plans](https://www.aviation.marines.mil/Portals/11/Documents/Aviation%20Plan/2022%20Marine%20Aviation%20Plan%20FINAL%20April%202022.pdf) even reduced the 16 PAA of F-35B squadrons (16 jets assigned, in otherwords) to 10 per squadron, in part due to pilot production/retention woes. So you're literally not filling jobs and instead of saying you have a retention problem, you just change what you say is required.\n\nThe feedback loop is key here: more deployments/less time at home, poor acquisitions, bad leadership, etc. all end up feeding burnout and a general loss of trust/faith in leadership and the institution, which means people are more keen to get out after their initial commitment, which then breeds all of the above.\n\nYou'll note that a lot of the articles/public pieces talk about production shortfalls. The branches not doing anything about QoL, OPTEMPO, etc. is a big sign to a lot of people of their lack of commitment in the investment they've made, hence retention problems. And they always talk about producing more pilots to get us out of this problem (which only feeds to the burnout of dudes working harder on their shore tours than their operational tours) and shortening training syllabi - which introduces its own problems, like guys getting wings that shouldn't be. The possibility of a lower quality of product coming out (and a bad pilot isn't just a risk to themselves, but everyone around them) is not helping the retention argument either.\n\nThis topic can go on and on - hell, it gets brought up damn near every day in every ready room across the branches.

            "body": ">those future policy/staff tours lose bodies\n\nI just wanted to add a little more on this, something I brought up yesterday but really fits well with what youre saying here. Staff tours arn't just time at home to fuck off, its not make work for officers. Its serious business. You have in the second comment a line about advising Combatant Commanders and that is absolutely true. But it can be spun into so many different things as well. What is the balance of the JCS staff and who exactly is advising/supporting the JCS? Can you trust an Army guy to understand fixed wing needs properly? Can you trust a USAF/USN air arm guy to have the best interests of their rival service at heart? There are a ton of smaller joint level commands with staffs that do all kinds of policy planning, war planning, acquisitions, R&D, what have you where a pilot may well be *needed* to provide accurate feedback, advice, and support on the command's mission. Another example, doctrine writing. Should the USAF let guys without wings be writing their doctrine? Obviously not. \n\nThe compounding issue which hurts retention even more is Goldwater-Nichols. A component of that legislation was that the services all agreed to reorient their promotion structure from work within the services to work within joint staffs. For an officer to see higher promotion, especially if that officer dreams of general/admiral stars, staff work has always been an important requirement for promotion. Nobody likes to do it, which is why it had to be a requirement, but it opens a ton of doors for mid-career officers who are at that decision point and are trying to think about the 10 year question (where will I be in 10 years?) at 10 years in. GN says that joint staff service takes precedence and is an *important* requirement to hitting the O-5 & -6 ranks. And of course if you think you have what it takes to become O-7, that aint happening without staff work. All this was done in the 1980s because the US Navy at that time basically refused to send officers to joint staffs, and joint staff work was considered in USN promotion evaluations to be a career killer. It mean you were not good enough to be on an internal Navy planning or doctrine writing staff. Because of this, GN has made the reverse true. You miss joint staff service, you well may miss other things. \n\nThe important takeaway here is that the lack of staff service is yet another blow for the career officer. They may *want* to fly, but to maximize time with operational units you have to check the boxes. But if manning levels are too low and youre forced into operational units without checking the right things, your flying career may well be dramatically shortened, your chance at promotion and the silver chicken dramatically less. So if youre an O-4 and realizing you may not get O-6, why stay in at all? Why not bounce out into one of the other professions. If, as an O-4, you hop over into commercial you may well get to the top of the paychart, again as you have said above. \n\nAll three branches are really struggling with retention rates right now, and have been for damn near the past ten years. I read articles in Proceedings from 2015 about retention problems in the USN and its only getting worse. The services have been really slow about shifting, IMO, to the needs of younger millennials and Gen Z. Combined with demographic issues, you have fewer people going in, fewer people staying in, and too many officers at mid and senior grades making choices out of institutional momentum and driving officers out. Anecdotally, I follow a few Army guys who make funny Tik Toks about military life in their cars. #1 complaint always seems to be officers, not the work, because officers are setting up toxic work cultures that push people out. There needs to be a culture shift around having healthier workplaces, renewed focus on getting the mission done, rather than building a toxic bro culture.",

A component of that legislation was that the services all agreed to reorient their promotion structure from work within the services to work within joint staffs. For an officer to see higher promotion, especially if that officer dreams of general/admiral stars, staff work has always been an important requirement for promotion. Nobody likes to do it, which is why it had to be a requirement, but it opens a ton of doors for mid-career officers who are at that decision point and are trying to think about the 10 year question (where will I be in 10 years?) at 10 years in. GN says that joint staff service takes precedence and is an <em>important</em> requirement to hitting the O-5 &amp; -6 ranks. And of course if you think you have what it takes to become O-7, that aint happening without staff work. All this was done in the 1980s because the US Navy at that time basically refused to send officers to joint staffs, and joint staff work was considered in USN promotion evaluations to be a career killer. It mean you were not good enough to be on an internal Navy planning or doctrine writing staff. Because of this, GN has made the reverse true. You miss joint staff service, you well may miss other things. </p>\n\n<p>The important takeaway here is that the lack of staff service is yet another blow for the career officer. They may <em>want</em> to fly, but to maximize time with operational units you have to check the boxes. But if manning levels are too low and youre forced into operational units without checking the right things, your flying career may well be dramatically shortened, your chance at promotion and the silver chicken dramatically less. So if youre an O-4 and realizing you may not get O-6, why stay in at all? Why not bounce out into one of the other professions. If, as an O-4, you hop over into commercial you may well get to the top of the paychart, again as you have said above. </p>\n\n<p>All three branches are really struggling with retention rates right now, and have been for damn near the past ten years. I read articles in Proceedings from 2015 about retention problems in the USN and its only getting worse. The services have been really slow about shifting, IMO, to the needs of younger millennials and Gen Z. Combined with demographic issues, you have fewer people going in, fewer people staying in, and too many officers at mid and senior grades making choices out of institutional momentum and driving officers out. Anecdotally, I follow a few Army guys who make funny Tik Toks about military life in their cars. #1 complaint always seems to be officers, not the work, because officers are setting up toxic work cultures that push people out. There needs to be a culture shift around having healthier workplaces, renewed focus on getting the mission done, rather than building a toxic bro culture.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "Ukrainian military observer Mashovets this morning confirmed that the 104th Regiment of the 76th VDV Division has been deployed to the south-east of Novoprokopivka, which by the way seems to be the most critical area in the sector right now. The 234th and 237th, the 76th Division's other two maneuver regiments, would also be in the rear according to him.\n\nThe Russians have reportedly moved quite a few units into the sector during the last week, like two regiments of the 2nd Corps (part of the 8th Army - former LPR Corps), one of which is holding the ridgelines where the \"Height 166\" is located, probably the purpose of their deployment is to use them as cannon fodder, considering the attrition of the Russian territorial forces' regiments and of the BARS detachments already deployed in the sector... Also, at a least a battalion of the 503rd Motorized Regiment of the 19th MRD (this regiment covers the hitherto fairly quiet area between Kamyanske and Robotyne) would have been transferred from Nesterianka to Kopani, where the Ukrainians have been doing some probes to try to widen the flanks of their advance towards the South. This regiment is still fairly fresh afaik. Elements of the 4th Military Base (58th Army) would also have been moved near Novoprokopivka from the Kamyanske sector. By now we are talking about lateral transfers, as the Russians are imho approaching the \"minimum limit\" of formations they have to hold along the Dnipro, except for a few units perhaps,  at least until the new formations they are creating will be able to be moved there. The one thing they could do at this point, like they are starting to do, is to ask for reinforcements from the 8th Army from the eastern front, since the Russians don't seem to be eager to touch the brigades (all of them still quite fresh) of the 35th Army in Polohy... Let's recall that in the Tokmak sector there are still most of the 42nd MRD, the 100th Reconnaissance Brigade as well as the 22nd Brigade and elements of the 45th Brigade (both are Spetsnaz GRU), which usually provide reconnaissance activities, Lancet operators, snipers, but are also used for some local counterattacks. Plus there are at least two battalions of the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade, one of which was brought in from near Kamyanske. I imagine that the deployment of VDV units in the area could be explained by the fact that this brigade which has often been used to face Ukrainian attacks (the notorious debacle of a Company tactical group from the 118th Mech Brigade in late July was the work of a battalion of the 810th NIB, as far as I read) and also for counterattacks, may begin to be losing combat effectiveness.\n\nPersonally, I was a little skeptical about the relocation of 76th VDV Division, but it seems to be confirmed, as I wrote above. Kofman too wrote that he has indications that the 76th has been moved. Probably the bulk of this formation arrived in Berdyansk and is getting ready to be deployed in the Tokmak sector. I was skeptical because the Russians sent two regiments of the 7th VDV Division (56th and 108th - the 247th has been in the Velyka Novosilka sector for almost two months) to the Tokmak sector in the first half of this month... And they are already sending new reinforcements. This is not to imply that units of the 7th Division have had huge losses - they have still been involved quite marginally as far as I know, but it does make it clear that the Russians are seeing an high potential risk there if they are moving so many elite units into that sector in such a short time. It appears that in the coming weeks the bulk of the fighting will be between VDV units against elements of the Ukrainian Air Assault Forces, which began getting seriously committed during last week, between Robotyne and Verbove. Russia continues to use the elite + \"expendable\" mobilized/BARS units combo to hold the lines.\n\nFor instance, two battalions of the 336th Naval Infantry Brigade, still fresh and among the best formations they have in the South, are reported to have been deployed in the flanks around Staromlynivka to support formations that are either battered like the 60th MRB or have quite disappointed like the 37th MRB. VDV and the Naval Infantry are also often, according to the Ukrainians, used as \"fire fighters\": i.e., a part of these units don't hold a given frontline, but are in the tactical reserve ready to be employed in the hottest area of a given sector to support other units. It's for this reason that in Urozhaine the marines of the 155th Brigade covered the retreat of the other units together with their colleagues from the 40th NIB, despite the fact that the 155th NIB is attached to the 29th Army which is deployed in Vuhledar. \n\nIf the 7th VDV Division was practically fresh after the long recovery from the Kherson campaign (it always remained on the other side of the Dnipro), let's remember that the 76th VDV Division cannot be properly considered a Russian strategic reserve (like I've read these days), as it was fully active in the Kreminna sector, specifically mainly in the Serebrianka Forest. It had been deployed there since November when the Russians withdrew from Kherson and managed to block Ukrainian efforts along the Zherebets and in the aforementioned forest. It's considered the best VDV formation both because of its military tradition and because along with the 7th Division it's the largest and the best equipped - it also fields a tank battalion for example.\n\nAs we know the 217th Regiment of the 98th VDV Division was transferred to the Dubovo-Vasylivka salient in the second half of June. If the transfer of the entire 76th VDV Division were confirmed, it would mean that only the 331st Regiment of the 98th Division is remaining in the Kreminna sector, which until Wagner's withdrawal from Bakhmut represented the largest VDV grouping in Ukraine. Hence now the overwhelming majority of the Russians deployed there are likely from the 41st Army with its three brigades + the 90th Tank Division, which is a much less competent formation than the VDV. This would be good news for the Ukrainians deployed in the area - Kreminna has undoubtedly been among the bloodiest sectors for the Ukrainians in the past 9 months and since June the Ukrainians have sent several additional brigades there; on the other hand this could reflect that the 76th VDV Division that had been leading the Russian efforts in the Kreminna sector is unlikely to be at 100% of its capabilities.\n\nThe 51st Regiment of the 106th VDV Division would have been transferred from the northern flank to the southern flank of Bakhmut, near Kurdyumivka, according to the Centre for Defence Strategies. This Division is entirely deployed around Bakhmut. I had read a few weeks ago from a Telegram channel close to it that some elements of the 106th had been transferred near Kreminna for a short period during June to support VDV efforts there, but now it's definitely entirely back in Bakhmut. \n\nThe 31st VDV Brigade as far as I know had been withdrawn about a month ago from the first line in Bakhmut after considerable losses... This is the first formation that arrived in the first half of May in Bakhmut (along with the 72nd Brigade of the 3rd Corps and the 200th Brigade of the Arctic Fleet) after Wagner's withdrawal. I remember that Twitter page (@KilledInUkraine) that keeps track of the obituaries of Russian officers fallen in action, had published quite a few fallen officers from this brigade during June or so. The 83rd VDV Brigade is the reason why the Ukrainians have not fully liberated Klishchiivka yet but is still suffering major losses. The 11th VDV Brigade is in the area too and is the most fresh air assault formation they have in Bakhmut. On the southern flank of Bakhmut the 8th Army has sent two regiments of the 150th MRD from Marinka, in addition to several units of the 2nd Corps, which is overwhelmingly concentrated between Bilohorivka and Klishchiivka.\n\nThe Bakhmut affair, although Ukrainian progress is not fast, is very useful as it's creating considerable attriction in Russian units without the Ukrainians having to deploy their strategic reserves in the area. According to the Centre for Defence Strategies, elements of the 18th Motorized Division (11th Corps, WMD) were reportedly transferred to the Dubovo-Vasylivka salient recently. Let's await further confirmation - until now this division was the Russian operational reserve in the Kupyansk sector. In the latter sector I read that Russian efforts have slowed down and despite some minor positional successes, Synkivka is still firmly in Ukrainian hands, partly due to a quite large influx of reserves. The brigades of the 2nd Army of the Central MD have reportedly resumed attacks towards Novojehorivka (Svatove sector) but at the moment without success, as far as I can see.",

The limit Russia prefers to have is not to mix units from different Military Districts for command, control, and coordination reasons, although in certain difficult areas such as Bakhmut this is no longer possible. It's often difficult to find a formation that can be entirely send to a sector, so they fix this by having one unit sent from this formation, another from a different one, etc. A case in point is the 5th Army of the Eastern MD, which covers the western bank of the Mokri Yaly River up to near Marfopil but \"lost\" its 57th MRB which they had to send to Andriivka near Bakhmut and so this brigade was probably temporarily put under the command of the 8th Army of the SMD. As a result, the 127th MRD of the 5th Army had to be reinforced by the 71st Motorized Regiment of the 42nd MRD, which should have been in the Orikhiv sector instead.\n\nUkraine is a specialist in this actually, there are brigades that have their battalions dozens and dozens of kilometers apart in completely different areas.

It&#39;s often difficult to find a formation that can be entirely send to a sector, so they fix this by having one unit sent from this formation, another from a different one, etc. A case in point is the 5th Army of the Eastern MD, which covers the western bank of the Mokri Yaly River up to near Marfopil but &quot;lost&quot; its 57th MRB which they had to send to Andriivka near Bakhmut and so this brigade was probably temporarily put under the command of the 8th Army of the SMD. As a result, the 127th MRD of the 5th Army had to be reinforced by the 71st Motorized Regiment of the 42nd MRD, which should have been in the Orikhiv sector instead.</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine is a specialist in this actually, there are brigades that have their battalions dozens and dozens of kilometers apart in completely different areas. Because maybe one sector needed reinforcements, and a given brigade was in a position to send a battalion of theirs. Although it must be said that the Ukrainian structure is completely different compared to the Russian one and very (perhaps too much) simplified.</p>\n</div>",

                "body": "> What's going on with Russia deploying parts of a formation all over the place instead keeping a given unit concentrated? \n\nThere are a few factors contributing to this practice. First, the Russians only really half reformed their military during the 2010s, leading to wide variance in the organization, staffing, and capabilities of units that nominally share the same echelonment. Variations between different military districts were apparently especially acute, because they were and are run as entirely independent commands, with no shared resources or units between them and little coordination, never mind standardization of their practices. So a pre-war regiment in the WMD might look more like brigade in the EMD, which might look more like a CMD divsion, and so on (to be clear, that's a made up example to illustrate the point, not a real description of their echelonment).\n\nThey attempted to address some of these issues with the Battalion Tactical Group concept. BTGs were meant to be essentially temporary combined arms formations with detached elements from various parent units combined into a single maneuver element that could be customized by adding or removing elements to match the specific mission requirements while remaining theoretically capable of fighting independently of any supporting command, albeit for relatively short periods of time because of limited organic logistics. The inconsistency of the BTG arrangements probably contributed to many of the Russians' early difficulties in the war, especially in terms of coordinating independent war fighting functions and logistics, and they have since apparently abandoned the concept and reverted to fighting mostly as traditional battalions, regiments/brigades, divisions, and Combined Arms Armies.\n\nIn the meantime, they have suffered incredible attrition across their armed forces, leading them to smash bits and pieces of decimated units together into new Frankenstein formations. They've also mobilized something north of 400k soldiers in that time, and allocated them mostly to larger formations such as motorized rifle divisions while keeping many smaller veteran units separate (including some Frankenstein units).\n\nThe larger, mobik-heavy units are largely being allocated toward positional defense at the front line, holding trenches. Meanwhile, the Russians are transferring those smaller units around laterally between hot spots, where they are providing the reserve for an active defense to back up the mobiks manning the first line trenches. In other words, the Russians are using more elite or veteran regiments and brigades how they previously used BTGs, but without the coordination issues of ad hoc combinations pulled from multiple parent units. And with attrition, many of those brigades and divisions could very well be in reality battalion-sized, so using them like BTGs would be a relatively intuitive tactic for a Russian general to adopt.\n\n> Does this dispersion of a division (or brigade) not hamper command & control, both of the unit itself AND of the frontline in question? \n\nProbably, although it is hard to tell what's general incompetence versus c2 frictions from inefficient allocation of forces looking in from the outside. In general, the brigade and below lateral transfers are happening largely within individual military districts where c2 can be maintained because there is a shared chain of command. The SMD is in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia up to the Donetsk Oblast border, the EMD covers from there up toward Kreminna, and the WMD controls the Svatove-Kreminna line. Transfers between each district's AOR seem to consist primarily of division-sized units, particularly VDV divisions, which should be able to operate entirely independently, so transferring them cross-district likely mitigates some of the c2 fragmentation you might get from transferring around battalion-sized or below units.  \n\nThe result of all of this is... chaotic. \n\n> Why are they doing this?\n\nDesperation. They have no strategic reserves, so if they need reserves in one area, they must transfer units from one part of the line to another instead. Units deployed to the lines are typically needed where they are deployed, though. So often the Russians can't just pull an entire division off the line, and instead they pull whatever part of the division can be spared.",

Our long term models have improved significantly the last decade or so. They pretty much perfectly predicted the winter weather last year. It all comes down to pretty basic physics. We just needed the super computers to run millions of model iterations to really do it consistently well.  \n\n\nBut of course I'm talking about regional outlooks.

Ukraine has lost 60 tanks (39 destroyed) to Russia's 78 (61 destroyed), 21 MLRS/artillery (14 destroyed) to Russia's 66 (58 destroyed), 6 trucks to Russia's 58, and 2 ADS to Russia's 12.

A T-72 might pop its turret and suffer a complete loss from a hit where a western tank might instead just bend a torsion rod or something relatively minor like that. The Ukrainian losses among tanks haven't been that bad if you take that into account. Notably that 60 destroyed tanks figure quoted above includes both western and legacy T- variants.

There have been substantially fewer challenges getting and maintaining access to IFVs in general than has been the case for MBTs. Plus they are cheaper and Ukraine has acquired them from a broader coalition than MBTs (and so the risk of losing support from any given ally is less of a threat to the overall pipeline of replacement equipment).

More importantly, they are clearly not able to maintain ammunition supplies at the front. Without ammo it doesn't matter how many guns they have. They've lost about half of their military trucks too, so they may even struggle to source ruggedized vehicles capable of towing the weapons off road near the front under combat conditions. \n\n> Will the West donate any more 155s?\n\nYes, absolutely. There are already a number of committed donations that are in production as we speak. Many of which will be dramatically better in quality than the somewhat outdated M109s which have suffered the most losses of any western SPG in Ukraine. Those donations are almost certain to go forward because the money is already allocated, most artillery systems are uncontroversial, and the donations are relatively inexpensive when compared to the higher end systems like F-16s. In any case, the Ukrainians haven't been suffering tremendously high loss rates with their western SPGs either, something like 12% of the 415+ SPGs delivered so far. Those rates have especially dropped over the past month as Russian counterbattery fires have dwindled to almost nothing.\n\nAs Russia's SPG supplies dwindles, if they do backfill with their stored 152mm towed artillery, the west could afford to provide Ukraine with equivalent capabilities just by rooting around in their couch cushions for some extra change, so it is unlikely to be politically controversial.

This is based on Volnovakha (on the far other end of the line) theoretically being within Ukrainian 155 range. \n\nThis is founded on numerous poor assumptions. A train can be unloaded in the span of an hour or two. Train lines are difficult to damage with artillery, and are easily repaired within hours. Ukraine does not have eyes on the Tokmak rail station and cannot reliably attack trains as they arrive, especially if they pass through the station to another town. If they did attack a train with long-range Excaliburs and similar, the chances of hitting a target worth a fire mission is low. The effects would be minimal unless the train engine were successfully destroyed or a very large ammo cache were hit.\n\nRussia has also refrained from attacking train logistical hubs throughout Ukraine. The logic is the same: You would not achieve results worth the cost unless you can continuously attack the line with low-cost dumb shells. This isn't the case even in Volnovakha: It is roughly 25 km from the Volnovakha train station to the nearest point I would consider reasonable for Ukrainian artillery to set up for a high-risk fires mission (around 4 km from Russian forward observers, which would be high risk indeed). Needless to say, Ukraine isn't going to risk their 155s on the off-chance they hit something juicy at Volnovakha's train station.\n\nSame is true of Tokmak. Only way to interdict rail supplies through Tokmak is to put it in range of Ukrainian M795 shells (around 22 km max range) at a reasonably safe distance.

They can't run rail from northern Donetsk and Luhansk to the southern front without rerouting all the way through Crimea. Ukraine's objective is to logistically choke everything east of Tokmak by interdicting the train line there. Supplies would be forced to run along Ukraine's Azov coast highway via truck.

        "body": "**Inside Ukraine\u2019s drone war against Putin**\n\n*New types of drone are striking deep inside Russia, but scaling up is hard*\n\nEarly in the morning of August 25th, a group of drone developers headed to a launch point in southern Ukraine for one of the most daring aerial missions over Russian-controlled territory to date: an attack on a military base deep in Crimea. It was described as a test launch, with many of the prototypes in the drone swarm experimental. But some of them did the job.\n\nThere were explosions inside the base and several dead, with wounded soldiers seen streaming into the local hospital, according to local sources. That capped a miserable week for the Kremlin, already struggling to explain more than a dozen drones striking the heart of Moscow, repeated shutdowns of major airports and unexplained explosions at arms factories, airfields, fuel depots and railways.\n\nA source close to the developers of Morok (\u201cdark spirit\u201d), one of the prototype drones used in the Crimean operation, says Ukraine\u2019s new aerial strike capacity is the result of \u201cseeds sown many months ago\u201d. Morok\u2019s development had been a \u201cmiraculous\u201d journey: after one risky test launch a few kilometres from the Russian border, its developers escaped incoming Russian rockets by minutes. Now they aim to step up serial production.\n\nFast and capable of carrying a heavy payload over several hundred kilometres, Morok is among the more promising fixed-wing kamikaze designs being considered by Ukraine. It has come this far largely without government funding, relying on hard work and a few friendly benefactors. But like other developers, Morok\u2019s team now faces a difficult task getting the resources to scale up.\n\nUkraine\u2019s drone programme is driven by necessity. Russia, a missile superpower, began the war with a clear superiority in long-range strike capacity. It later began buying cheap, effective Shahed kamikaze drones from Iran. Ukraine, on the other hand, has not been allowed to use Western-donated weapons in Russia itself, and so has been looking for other ways to hit back.\n\nPart of the answer has been developing new missiles, or repurposing old ones: the vintage s-200 surface-to-air missile is now used in surface-to-surface mode. The modernised s-200s have been responsible for some of the recent attacks in Russian-controlled areas. Meanwhile, a network of volunteers and government groups has been racing to develop better domestically made drones.\n\nThe drone campaign is being stepped up now for a number of reasons. The headline-making strikes on Moscow are intended to have a psychological impact, bringing ordinary Russians closer to the reality of war. But Ukrainian military insiders say most of their operations directly support the three-month-old counter-offensive.\n\nMuch of this is too prosaic to make news. Drones target \u201cfuel depots, logistics, ammunition dumps and delivery routes\u201d, says Detective, the pseudonym of a drone co-ordinator in Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence. \u201cWe respond to appeals from our brigades. They tell us they know where Russian arms are being stored, but have no way of hitting them, and they plead with us to help.\u201d Detective says much of his recent work has been focused on airfields near Ukraine\u2019s borders. This \u201cmight\u201d have included a recent strike that hit a Tu-22m strategic bomber based near Novgorod, he adds with a wink.\n\nRussia\u2019s extensive air-defence and electronic-warfare capacity means that any Ukrainian attack requires meticulous planning. Ukraine has developed algorithms that appear to work. Operators launch in the early morning (when defenders\u2019 concentration might be lapsing) and use an order of attack designed to keep air defences busy. They gather intelligence (often from Western partners) about radars, electronic warfare and air-defence assets. Russia cannot lock down the entirety of its vast territory. \u201cIf you can scuttle past 60km of jamming stations on the border, you are in the Russian hinterlands and it\u2019s game on,\u201d says the Morok source. About 35-40% of drones make it through to the general vicinity of the target. Feedback about a strike\u2019s success is compiled from satellites, tracking devices, social-media reports and local agents.\n\nUnusually, Ukraine\u2019s drone programme has no single command or procurement structure. Several state organisations, including all the intelligence agencies, have their own drone programmes. Freelance developers are also in the mix. These components are organised in cells that do not communicate with each other. This helps security and competition, but can make optimisation and mass production difficult. The central government, especially the Ministry of Digital Transformation, has tried to streamline financing and remove red tape. But bureaucracy, corruption and vested interests in the Ukrainian arms industry continue to act as a drag on development. Some of the operations targeting Moscow appear to be pr projects designed to bring a prototype to the attention of procurement bosses, rather than having military value.\n\nFinance is not the only barrier to scaling up. Cheap components and electronics are hard to find. So are aviation specialists. Russia is doing better on this front: though slow to get going, it has now geared up mass production. With unlimited budgets, Russian state enterprises have prioritised the war\u2019s most effective weapons. These include versatile Kh-101 cruise missiles; wings to convert free-fall bombs into glide bombs; Lancet strike drones, capable of taking out Ukrainian armour and air defence; and Iranian Shaheds, which are now reportedly being produced in a new factory in Tatarstan. A senior Ukrainian intelligence source said Russia was likely to be stockpiling ahead of a renewed campaign on energy infrastructure this coming winter.\n\nOn the frontlines, Russia has erased Ukraine\u2019s initial three-to-one advantage in tactical drones. The two sides are now at parity, a source close to Ukraine\u2019s commander-in-chief says. New electronic-warfare jamming boxes, fitted on tanks and other high-value assets, are meanwhile reducing the ability of Ukraine\u2019s first-person-view drones to guide payloads into the most vulnerable sections of a target.\n\nA source in Ukraine\u2019s general staff suggests any technological advantage his country once enjoyed was necessarily temporary. Both sides are learning from the other, he says, and reverse engineering is getting quicker: \u201cWe had the experience of defending against Russian drones, and we got better quickly. They will too.\u201d Ukraine will need to think of new asymmetric ways to use drones, including using artificial intelligence to improve accuracy. The government has dedicated a new budget line of 40bn hryvnia ($1.1bn) for drones, a huge sum for Ukraine.\n\nDetective says he regularly receives calls from the frontlines, thanking him for his latest successful strike. \u201cThey tell how they have enjoyed two or three days without Russian bombs,\u201d he says. \u201cCalls like that make the difficulties of the job worth it.\u201d \n\nhttps://www.economist.com/europe/2023/08/27/inside-ukraines-drone-war-against-putin",

With a drone you get to ***choose*** your angle.  If we're talking quadcopters, then you can pan tilt zoom and maneuver the drone into almost any position imaginable and hold it there.

They might literally only be able to advance down one treeline wheras the drone has full 3D space to work with.  And the enemy position is probably designed specifically to be minimally visible and maximally deadly towards whichever directions the reconnaissance team may want to advance from.

It's in Russian, so I recommend using DeepL to translate.\n\n[Russian NPOs raised 113 billion rubles in support of the military in 2022](https://holod.media/2023/08/28/nko-sbori/)\n\nA few highlights from the article and its cited study:\n\n\n* 113 billion rubles is about 1.2 billion USD. A billion and two hundred million US dollars. That feels like a lot, especially in a country where $400 a month is considered a decent income and most people don't make that much.\n* Compared to 2021 military donations grew by 28%\n* The study only looked at donation through the Vkontakte social network, and only by looking at four popular z-patriotic hashtags. So the real scope of the donations is bigger, possibly by a lot.\n* While government organizations make up the majority of implicated NPOs, for every one NPO there are apparently two individuals fundraising to help the Russian war effort.\n* This increase also comes on the heels of a dramatic drop in charity donations in other spheres as 80% of Russian NPOs have been forced to downsize. People are donating much more to the war effort and much less to other causes. \n* A number of NPOs originally supported other causes such as helping orphanages or ill children, but have now shifted to supporting the war.\n* People don't just donate money, but labor as well - volunteers make camouflage nets and... uh... candles? This hits close to home for me because I personally know several women who have volunteered to make camouflage nets.\n\nI hope this article helps push people out of the \"Russians are apathetic\" myth.",

It&#39;s in Russian, so I recommend using DeepL to translate.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://holod.media/2023/08/28/nko-sbori/\">Russian NPOs raised 113 billion rubles in support of the military in 2022</a></p>\n\n<p>A few highlights from the article and its cited study:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>113 billion rubles is about 1.2 billion USD. A billion and two hundred million US dollars. That feels like a lot, especially in a country where $400 a month is considered a decent income and most people don&#39;t make that much.</li>\n<li>Compared to 2021 military donations grew by 28%</li>\n<li>The study only looked at donation through the Vkontakte social network, and only by looking at four popular z-patriotic hashtags. So the real scope of the donations is bigger, possibly by a lot.</li>\n<li>While government organizations make up the majority of implicated NPOs, for every one NPO there are apparently two individuals fundraising to help the Russian war effort.</li>\n<li>This increase also comes on the heels of a dramatic drop in charity donations in other spheres as 80% of Russian NPOs have been forced to downsize. People are donating much more to the war effort and much less to other causes. </li>\n<li>A number of NPOs originally supported other causes such as helping orphanages or ill children, but have now shifted to supporting the war.</li>\n<li>People don&#39;t just donate money, but labor as well - volunteers make camouflage nets and... uh... candles? This hits close to home for me because I personally know several women who have volunteered to make camouflage nets.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I hope this article helps push people out of the &quot;Russians are apathetic&quot; myth.</p>\n</div>",

Russia offered (by russian standards) pretty high financial incentives\n\n*Was* there a lack of volunteers? Do we have those numbers? Do you? And do we have context for them - is there data on similar wars that can tell us how many volunteers there are expected to be in a similar situation? And did Russia really fall very short of those numbers?\n\nAnd then I would argue back that there wasn't a deluge of volunteers exactly because of poor incentives. Here's one huge glaring deterrent to people volunteering: **in order to sign up you need to permanently quit your regular job**. Anecdotal again, but quite a few people I knew wanted to serve but didn't want to lose their job, which was exactly why they welcomed the mobilization - mobiks keeps their jobs. On top of that signing a contract with the MOD is not something everyone can do - one needs to have completed regular conscription service and there are strict fitness requirements. \n\nSo, before mobilization your average Russian volunteer fighting on the frontline would have been someone with previous military experience, very fit and skilled and either so wealthy or so zealous that they aren't bothered by the risk of being unable to provide for their families should they struggle to find a job later or die in action. Just how large would the pool of such people even be? Is there a reason to think that the number of volunteers in March-August 2023 was small when compared to that pool?",
