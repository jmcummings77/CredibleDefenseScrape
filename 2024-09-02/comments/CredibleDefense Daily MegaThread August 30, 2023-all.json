Accordingly, I will not have to give in to the wishes of my friends to the detriment of the Russian economy.  </p></li>\n<li><p>Vladimir Vladimirovich is a highly moral person, always true to his word and firmly fulfilling the promises given to those who brought him to power in the late nineties. I have promised nothing to anyone and can therefore ignore all the personal guarantees of all the presidents of the Russian Federation from 1991 to the present, if I consider that this is useful for the people and the state.  </p></li>\n<li><p>I am not as athletic and healthy as Vladimir Vladimirovich was at my age, therefore, I will not be able to bother you, dear voters, purely physically for more than 20 years, even if I suddenly have a desire to mess with you after the military crisis is overcome and its most severe consequences.  </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I.I.

        "body": "New piece by Julia Ioffe on the reaction of Russian elites to the decapitation of Wagner.\n\nhttps://archive.li/tKmhB\n\n> ## Wagner After Prigozhin & the Next Putsch Attempt\n\n> On the day of Yevgeny Prigozhin\u2019s funeral, journalists spotted his hearse at the Manege of the First Cadet Corps, a classical, Easter-yellow building on one of St. Petersburg\u2019s famous embankments. The gate was blocked by a refrigerator of a man in a black leather jacket and black sunglasses. The building was closed, according to the security detail, \u201cfor a private event.\u201d The details of when and where Prigozhin would be buried had been hard to find. The Kremlin was unsurprisingly tight-lipped except to say that Vladimir Putin would not be attending.\n\n> By Monday, journalists in St. Petersburg discovered that metal detectors had been installed at the Serafimovskoe Cemetery, where Putin\u2019s parents were buried, and everyone thought that this would be the site of Prigozhin\u2019s interment. Until Tuesday, when three hearses that looked just like the one at the Manege were spotted at a different St. Petersburg cemetery, the Beloostrovsky. They were there with a black BMW bearing the same license plate as a similar car the mercenary boss had used back in the day. But then another BMW, with the same license plate, was spotted at River Palace, the luxury hotel associated with Prigozhin.\n\n> Meanwhile, mourners, some bearing Wagner insignia, streamed into a third cemetery\u2014Severnoe\u2014where the national guard was working the perimeter. Someone spotted Prigozhin\u2019s bodyguard, who had somehow not been onboard the doomed Embraer jet. A coffin arrived, but it turned out to bear the remains of Valery Chekalov, one of the Wagner commanders who was with Prigozhin at the time of the crash. Back at Serafimovskoe, TV cameras and a drone flying overhead watched as K9 units patrolled the area and a Wagner hearse pulled in, rumored to be carrying Prigozhin\u2019s body.\n\n> Then came the announcement, from Prigozhin\u2019s press service. \u201cYevgeny Vikotorovich\u2019s funeral took place in a private setting,\u201d it read. \u201cThose who wish to say goodbye can visit Porokhovskoye Cemetery.\u201d While everyone had been chasing hearses around St. Petersburg, Prigozhin had already been buried\u2014next to his father, surrounded by a few dozen friends and family members. It was a fitting end for a man who had a dozen aliases and lived his life on the run\n\n> Though Prigozhin had been a Hero of Russia, the country\u2019s highest military honor, there was no honor guard, no military salute. State television largely skipped over his burial. All he got was police, some bearing anti-drone rifles, densely stationed around the cemetery\u2019s perimeter, blocking anyone who would dare to enter. Among the red roses on the fresh mound of Prigozhin\u2019s grave, someone had left the poem of another son of St. Petersburg, the Soviet dissident Joseph Brodsky, about the Virgin Mary trying to understand if Jesus had been her son or her god, if he was dead or alive. \u201cDead or alive, woman,\u201d it read, \u201cit\u2019s all the same.\n\n> Nearly a week has passed since Prigozhin fell out of the sky and the Moscow elites are still reckoning with what it means for them. Some of them, as I wrote last week, understood the message from Putin quite clearly: If you betray me, I will punish you. \u201cThey will all be nullified,\u201d one Moscow friend explained, using the Wagner term for killing someone, \u201cregardless of their closeness [to Putin] or level of trust.\n\n> But the Russian elite is not monolithic. As this friend put it, \u201cThe old elite has long ago stuck their tongues in their asses,\u201d using the Russian slang for shutting up. \u201cThe siloviki, who are actually in charge, are getting ready to steal all their assets in the coming chaos.\u201d\n\n> The old elite are the ones that were called liberals. That is, within the Putinist structure, they were relatively liberal politically: they believed in changing the system from the inside, were classically liberal in terms of economic policy, and oriented toward integration with the West. Naturally, they have been gradually sidelined since the initial invasion of Ukraine, in 2014. After the full-scale war began, they became irrelevant in terms of decision-making power and live in constant fear. Earlier this year, I asked one prominent member of this elite for an interview and this person said that, because they and their family still live in Moscow, \u201cI will not talk to you about anything, not even the weather.\u201d\n\n> When I called another member of this old elite, now on vacation in the West, they were scathing in their assessment of Putin\u2019s \u201ccrumbling czardom\u201d\u2014a disaster and embarrassment whose end, they hope, is nigh. And they know that many of their friends and acquaintances feel the same, though it\u2019s hard to tell exactly how many. \u201cMany are scared, others are protecting their relatives and themselves,\u201d the source said, \u201cso it\u2019s hard to say how widespread it is.\u201d\n\n> \u201cThere are lots of conversations but they won\u2019t lead to anything because if you come out and say \u2018Ah,\u2019 you know what will happen to you,\u201d this former Kremlin liberal told me. \u201cIt won\u2019t be as extreme as what they did to Navalny, but you understand. No one wants to end up under the steamroller. Only kamikazes want to do that.\u201d I asked this source if they thought Putin blasting Prigozhin out of the sky was a lesson to the elite. \u201cIt\u2019s not a lesson,\u201d the liberal said. \u201cNo one was scared of this, because everyone is already scared.\u201d\n\n> **Another member of the elite told me that, despite their personal preferences, there was even some satisfaction in Prigozhin\u2019s demise. It was reassurance that, as the Kremlin liberal put it, \u201cthe machine still works.\u201d**\n\n> **\u201cIf you\u2019re talking about the foreign policy elite, their opinion of [Prigozhin] is highly negative for reasons you understand,\u201d said another source, a Moscow insider. \u201cNeither his style nor his methods appealed to them, these people who are liberally inclined\u2014not in the sense of wanting to give in to the collective West, but in the sense of wanting institutes and brakes. What I don\u2019t hear is that this makes Putin look bad. Why was Prigozhin flying around on his private jet and showing up at the summit of African leaders? It created the wrong impression of Russian power.**\n\n> **This person continued at length: \u201cThe idea that Prigozhin acted the way he did\u2014that he played such an active and externally notable role\u2014it was important to do something with him, especially since it was seen abroad as weakness and a crisis of power. Many people around me say that if he had behaved himself a little more modestly, then it\u2019s possible he wouldn\u2019t have had any problems. But he behaved provocatively\u2014especially after the mutiny. He put Putin in a very uncomfortable position, he put the government in a very uncomfortable position, he put the military and General Staff in a very uncomfortable position.\u201d**\n\n> This source, whom I\u2019ve known for years, was uncharacteristically circumspect, even hesitant in speaking about Prigozhin\u2019s death\u2014who was behind it, how it happened, and so forth. They crab-walked into every answer, sprinkling in scores of caveats and disclaimers. But they did manage to distill Putin\u2019s conundrum. \u201cPeople are asking, does this benefit the Kremlin?

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>New piece by Julia Ioffe on the reaction of Russian elites to the decapitation of Wagner.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://archive.li/tKmhB\">https://archive.li/tKmhB</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Wagner After Prigozhin &amp; the Next Putsch Attempt</h2>\n\n<p>On the day of Yevgeny Prigozhin\u2019s funeral, journalists spotted his hearse at the Manege of the First Cadet Corps, a classical, Easter-yellow building on one of St. Petersburg\u2019s famous embankments. The gate was blocked by a refrigerator of a man in a black leather jacket and black sunglasses. The building was closed, according to the security detail, \u201cfor a private event.\u201d The details of when and where Prigozhin would be buried had been hard to find. The Kremlin was unsurprisingly tight-lipped except to say that Vladimir Putin would not be attending.</p>\n\n<p>By Monday, journalists in St. Petersburg discovered that metal detectors had been installed at the Serafimovskoe Cemetery, where Putin\u2019s parents were buried, and everyone thought that this would be the site of Prigozhin\u2019s interment. Until Tuesday, when three hearses that looked just like the one at the Manege were spotted at a different St. Petersburg cemetery, the Beloostrovsky. They were there with a black BMW bearing the same license plate as a similar car the mercenary boss had used back in the day. But then another BMW, with the same license plate, was spotted at River Palace, the luxury hotel associated with Prigozhin.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, mourners, some bearing Wagner insignia, streamed into a third cemetery\u2014Severnoe\u2014where the national guard was working the perimeter. Someone spotted Prigozhin\u2019s bodyguard, who had somehow not been onboard the doomed Embraer jet. A coffin arrived, but it turned out to bear the remains of Valery Chekalov, one of the Wagner commanders who was with Prigozhin at the time of the crash. Back at Serafimovskoe, TV cameras and a drone flying overhead watched as K9 units patrolled the area and a Wagner hearse pulled in, rumored to be carrying Prigozhin\u2019s body.</p>\n\n<p>Then came the announcement, from Prigozhin\u2019s press service. \u201cYevgeny Vikotorovich\u2019s funeral took place in a private setting,\u201d it read. \u201cThose who wish to say goodbye can visit Porokhovskoye Cemetery.\u201d While everyone had been chasing hearses around St. Petersburg, Prigozhin had already been buried\u2014next to his father, surrounded by a few dozen friends and family members. It was a fitting end for a man who had a dozen aliases and lived his life on the run</p>\n\n<p>Though Prigozhin had been a Hero of Russia, the country\u2019s highest military honor, there was no honor guard, no military salute. State television largely skipped over his burial. All he got was police, some bearing anti-drone rifles, densely stationed around the cemetery\u2019s perimeter, blocking anyone who would dare to enter. Among the red roses on the fresh mound of Prigozhin\u2019s grave, someone had left the poem of another son of St. Petersburg, the Soviet dissident Joseph Brodsky, about the Virgin Mary trying to understand if Jesus had been her son or her god, if he was dead or alive. \u201cDead or alive, woman,\u201d it read, \u201cit\u2019s all the same.</p>\n\n<p>Nearly a week has passed since Prigozhin fell out of the sky and the Moscow elites are still reckoning with what it means for them. Some of them, as I wrote last week, understood the message from Putin quite clearly: If you betray me, I will punish you. \u201cThey will all be nullified,\u201d one Moscow friend explained, using the Wagner term for killing someone, \u201cregardless of their closeness [to Putin] or level of trust.</p>\n\n<p>But the Russian elite is not monolithic. As this friend put it, \u201cThe old elite has long ago stuck their tongues in their asses,\u201d using the Russian slang for shutting up. \u201cThe siloviki, who are actually in charge, are getting ready to steal all their assets in the coming chaos.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The old elite are the ones that were called liberals. That is, within the Putinist structure, they were relatively liberal politically: they believed in changing the system from the inside, were classically liberal in terms of economic policy, and oriented toward integration with the West. Naturally, they have been gradually sidelined since the initial invasion of Ukraine, in 2014. After the full-scale war began, they became irrelevant in terms of decision-making power and live in constant fear. Earlier this year, I asked one prominent member of this elite for an interview and this person said that, because they and their family still live in Moscow, \u201cI will not talk to you about anything, not even the weather.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>When I called another member of this old elite, now on vacation in the West, they were scathing in their assessment of Putin\u2019s \u201ccrumbling czardom\u201d\u2014a disaster and embarrassment whose end, they hope, is nigh. And they know that many of their friends and acquaintances feel the same, though it\u2019s hard to tell exactly how many. \u201cMany are scared, others are protecting their relatives and themselves,\u201d the source said, \u201cso it\u2019s hard to say how widespread it is.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThere are lots of conversations but they won\u2019t lead to anything because if you come out and say \u2018Ah,\u2019 you know what will happen to you,\u201d this former Kremlin liberal told me. \u201cIt won\u2019t be as extreme as what they did to Navalny, but you understand. No one wants to end up under the steamroller. Only kamikazes want to do that.\u201d I asked this source if they thought Putin blasting Prigozhin out of the sky was a lesson to the elite. \u201cIt\u2019s not a lesson,\u201d the liberal said. \u201cNo one was scared of this, because everyone is already scared.\u201d</p>\n\n<p><strong>Another member of the elite told me that, despite their personal preferences, there was even some satisfaction in Prigozhin\u2019s demise. It was reassurance that, as the Kremlin liberal put it, \u201cthe machine still works.\u201d</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>\u201cIf you\u2019re talking about the foreign policy elite, their opinion of [Prigozhin] is highly negative for reasons you understand,\u201d said another source, a Moscow insider. \u201cNeither his style nor his methods appealed to them, these people who are liberally inclined\u2014not in the sense of wanting to give in to the collective West, but in the sense of wanting institutes and brakes. What I don\u2019t hear is that this makes Putin look bad. Why was Prigozhin flying around on his private jet and showing up at the summit of African leaders? It created the wrong impression of Russian power.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>This person continued at length: \u201cThe idea that Prigozhin acted the way he did\u2014that he played such an active and externally notable role\u2014it was important to do something with him, especially since it was seen abroad as weakness and a crisis of power. Many people around me say that if he had behaved himself a little more modestly, then it\u2019s possible he wouldn\u2019t have had any problems. But he behaved provocatively\u2014especially after the mutiny. He put Putin in a very uncomfortable position, he put the government in a very uncomfortable position, he put the military and General Staff in a very uncomfortable position.\u201d</strong></p>\n\n<p>This source, whom I\u2019ve known for years, was uncharacteristically circumspect, even hesitant in speaking about Prigozhin\u2019s death\u2014who was behind it, how it happened, and so forth. They crab-walked into every answer, sprinkling in scores of caveats and disclaimers. But they did manage to distill Putin\u2019s conundrum. \u201cPeople are asking, does this benefit the Kremlin? No one thinks the Kremlin wants to shoot people in a plane down on their own territory,\u201d the insider said, using the cui bono analysis so endemic to Russian thinking. \u201cBut sometimes, there are no good options, and you have to do what you have to do.</p>\n\n<p>Others, like Christo Grozev of Bellingcat, believe that any future mutiny will be one led by the siloviki, possibly in cooperation with the oligarchs. \u201cThe takeaway is that the next putsch cannot be half-baked and reactive,\u201d Grozev said. \u201cThe next person who does it must have planned it all the way to the offices of the Kremlin, because they know otherwise they will be dead.\u201d And because Grozev accurately predicted, here in Puck, when the Wagner mutiny would take place, I asked him when we could expect the next one. \u201cI expect some major confrontation to come in October, November,\u201d he said. \u201cThe elites fear they can be next, they feel they need to act now.

                            "body": "Not why *all* voters rejected Corbyn, but many of his, um, less savoury convictions rallied all sorts of voters against him.\n\nHe was quite widely perceived as an anti-semite (see e.g. [this poll](https://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/more-than-85-per-cent-of-british-jews-think-jeremy-corbyn-is-antisemitic-1.469654)) and that reflected very badly on his party as well, which had come under fire for anti-semitism for about a decade by the time they lost the 2019 elections. His stance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict absolutely didn't help with this perception.\n\nHis stance on NATO (he favoured Britain leaving NATO, having NATO disbanded as it was an anachronistic institution which should've been disbanded when the Soviet Union fell, insisted that the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014 was provoked by American-led NATO expansionism, and later refused to give a definitive answer when asked if Britain would defend its NATO allies) was also extremely unpopular by association. Many of the leaders who made similar points, with similar arguments, were extremely unpopular among Labour voters. Not all Labour voters hold NATO in particularly high regard but it was very disconcerting to see a Labour leader making the same arguments and holding the same views as people that they viewed as their political archenemies.\n\nSome groups tried to paint him as a tankie or a Russian stooge and IMHO that wasn't a fair assessment. However, he was unable to do something that, unpalatable though it may be, high-level political leaders in democratic countries need to do: he was unable to acommodate different views within his own party (which certainly didn't help with the tankie stooge perception).\n\nHe was always one of the more pro-peace voices in the Labour camp (he was one of the few Labour MPs who opposed NATO intervention in Kosovo, for instance). But he never managed to make the transition from being the backbencher who represented his own particular niche of voters to being an energetic, mobilising Labour leader who gave equal voice to the concerns of all his voters, and gave all of them a chance to have their views and aspirations fought for. His ideas were representative of only a small part of Labour voters, and he not just stubbornly refused to campaign for the other ones, which I guess is a given for all political leaders, but sharply criticised them, and refused to disavow not only ideas that were obviously unpopular, but ideas that were borderline bonkers and shared by lots of unsavoury characters on *both* far sides of the political spectrum. So in the end only a small part of Labour voters ended up voting his way.\n\nThe ideas mentioned in the parent post are kind of in line with this. It's not *specifically* what alienated so many voters but it's definitely part of it. (Ninja edit:) I.e. he was similarly unable to reconcile views on internal policies, and on other aspects of foreign relations, especially Brexit. Ultimately, this alienated a lot of Labour voters, who felt completely unrepresented.

                            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Not why <em>all</em> voters rejected Corbyn, but many of his, um, less savoury convictions rallied all sorts of voters against him.</p>\n\n<p>He was quite widely perceived as an anti-semite (see e.g. <a href=\"https://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/more-than-85-per-cent-of-british-jews-think-jeremy-corbyn-is-antisemitic-1.469654\">this poll</a>) and that reflected very badly on his party as well, which had come under fire for anti-semitism for about a decade by the time they lost the 2019 elections. His stance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict absolutely didn&#39;t help with this perception.</p>\n\n<p>His stance on NATO (he favoured Britain leaving NATO, having NATO disbanded as it was an anachronistic institution which should&#39;ve been disbanded when the Soviet Union fell, insisted that the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014 was provoked by American-led NATO expansionism, and later refused to give a definitive answer when asked if Britain would defend its NATO allies) was also extremely unpopular by association. Many of the leaders who made similar points, with similar arguments, were extremely unpopular among Labour voters. Not all Labour voters hold NATO in particularly high regard but it was very disconcerting to see a Labour leader making the same arguments and holding the same views as people that they viewed as their political archenemies.</p>\n\n<p>Some groups tried to paint him as a tankie or a Russian stooge and IMHO that wasn&#39;t a fair assessment.

Instead, the influence operations are focused on developing a network of young leaders who the Kremlin hopes will support Russia or spread pro-Russia messages in their home countries, efforts not unlike the Soviet Union\u2019s spy agency\u2019s work to develop ideological allies and informants around the world.\n\n>A U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the newly released material described a group of so-called co-optees, who claim to be acting independently but in fact have been used by Russian intelligence agents to conduct influence operations against the United States. These operations include programs designed to build support for Russia among Americans and Europeans along with blunter efforts like fake grass-roots protests. The newly released material focuses on four Russians who have worked with Russian intelligence, including Natalia Burlinova, who was named in a Justice Department indictment that was unsealed this year.\n\n>[Russia uses social media channels to exploit Niger coup](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/27/russia-uses-social-media-channels-to-exploit-niger-coup)\n>>Moscow aiming to increase influence in Africa, winning lucrative contracts and gaining access to key resources\n\n>Content about Niger across 45 Russian Telegram channels affiliated with the Russian state or Wagner increased by 6,645% in the month after the coup, suggesting a keen interest in Moscow in exploiting the upheaval.\n\n>Logically detected only 11 pieces of content relating to Niger in the month before the coup, and 742 pieces of content since. The company identified a significant increase in the amount of content pushing anti-French narratives on these accounts, though it found that negative sentiments towards Paris in Niger, a former French colony, were already widespread before the coup.\n\n>The research will reinforce fears that Russia will seek to win influence, lucrative contracts and access to key resources in Niger after the overthrow of Bazoum.\n\n\n>[Meta says it has disrupted a massive disinformation campaign linked to Chinese law enforcement](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/29/meta-disrupts-chinese-misinformation-network-linked-to-law-enforcement-.html)\n\n>* Meta identified a Chinese disinformation campaign on several social media platforms that generated positive news about China and criticized journalists, activists and the U.S.\n>* Meta has disrupted the network on its own platforms and described it as the largest known operation of its kind in the world.\n>* The network was linked to Chinese law enforcement by Meta researchers.\n\n>\u201cTaken together, we assess Spamouflage to be the largest known cross-platform covert influence operation to date,\u201d Meta said in its quarterly threat report. \u201cAlthough the people behind this activity tried to conceal their identities and coordination, our investigation found links to individuals associated with Chinese law enforcement.\u201d\n\n>Meta also identified and disrupted other operations and published a more detailed analysis of a Russian disinformation campaign it identified shortly after the beginning of the 2022 war in Ukraine.\n\n>The disruptions come ahead of what will likely be a contentious election cycle.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>A few recent articles on increased disinformation attempts (some excerpts):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/25/us/politics/russia-intelligence-propaganda.html\">Russia Pushes Long-Term Influence Operations Aimed at the U.S. and Europe</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>A newly declassified American intelligence analysis says Russian spy agencies are using influence laundering techniques to hide the Kremlin\u2019s involvement in cultivating pro-Russia and anti-Ukraine messages.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But the information released by the United States on Friday is designed to show how much deeper Russian influence operations are than those efforts to sow dissent on the internet. Instead, the influence operations are focused on developing a network of young leaders who the Kremlin hopes will support Russia or spread pro-Russia messages in their home countries, efforts not unlike the Soviet Union\u2019s spy agency\u2019s work to develop ideological allies and informants around the world.</p>\n\n<p>A U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the newly released material described a group of so-called co-optees, who claim to be acting independently but in fact have been used by Russian intelligence agents to conduct influence operations against the United States. These operations include programs designed to build support for Russia among Americans and Europeans along with blunter efforts like fake grass-roots protests. The newly released material focuses on four Russians who have worked with Russian intelligence, including Natalia Burlinova, who was named in a Justice Department indictment that was unsealed this year.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/27/russia-uses-social-media-channels-to-exploit-niger-coup\">Russia uses social media channels to exploit Niger coup</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Moscow aiming to increase influence in Africa, winning lucrative contracts and gaining access to key resources</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Content about Niger across 45 Russian Telegram channels affiliated with the Russian state or Wagner increased by 6,645% in the month after the coup, suggesting a keen interest in Moscow in exploiting the upheaval.</p>\n\n<p>Logically detected only 11 pieces of content relating to Niger in the month before the coup, and 742 pieces of content since. The company identified a significant increase in the amount of content pushing anti-French narratives on these accounts, though it found that negative sentiments towards Paris in Niger, a former French colony, were already widespread before the coup.</p>\n\n<p>The research will reinforce fears that Russia will seek to win influence, lucrative contracts and access to key resources in Niger after the overthrow of Bazoum.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/29/meta-disrupts-chinese-misinformation-network-linked-to-law-enforcement-.html\">Meta says it has disrupted a massive disinformation campaign linked to Chinese law enforcement</a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Meta identified a Chinese disinformation campaign on several social media platforms that generated positive news about China and criticized journalists, activists and the U.S.</li>\n<li>Meta has disrupted the network on its own platforms and described it as the largest known operation of its kind in the world.</li>\n<li>The network was linked to Chinese law enforcement by Meta researchers.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\u201cTaken together, we assess Spamouflage to be the largest known cross-platform covert influence operation to date,\u201d Meta said in its quarterly threat report. \u201cAlthough the people behind this activity tried to conceal their identities and coordination, our investigation found links to individuals associated with Chinese law enforcement.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Meta also identified and disrupted other operations and published a more detailed analysis of a Russian disinformation campaign it identified shortly after the beginning of the 2022 war in Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>The disruptions come ahead of what will likely be a contentious election cycle. Concerns over the role of influence campaigns in past elections led social media platforms, including Meta, to institute stricter guidelines on both the kind of political content allowed and the labels it adds to that content.</p>\n\n<p>Influence campaigns have affected Meta users in the past, notably a Russia-backed campaign to inflame popular sentiment around the 2016 U.S. presidential election.</p>\n\n<p>But this disinformation network, while prolific, was not effective, Meta cybersecurity executives said on a briefing call.

My question is, do they plan to continue going in a straight line all the way to the Azov Sea?

And won't it only get worse as Ukraine goes further south? The more land they liberate in this narrow straight line, the more harassment there will be as the lines expand. And it would be very concentrated harassment as well considering the line is so narrow. \n\nThat's why I'm wondering if it would be a good idea to penetrate like a dozen or so kilometers south on the frontline, then turn around and liberate as many areas to the east and west of the penetration as they can to establish a buffer zone for the spearhead heading south. Then, they continue going south for a dozen kilometers, and then do the same thing again. Rinse and repeat until they reach the Azov Sea.\n\nAgain, I'm no military strategist but that sounds safer to me than simply going in a straight narrow line all the way to the sea.",

It may be a good idea for them to keep heading east/southeast after Verbove, towards Berdyansk, there is a high point, then its all downhill from there. But they will have to go whichever way they can. Beggars can't be choosers.   \n\n\nMap: [https://en-gb.topographic-map.com/map-4d9jnh/The-World/?center=47.24754%2C35.96924&zoom=9](https://en-gb.topographic-map.com/map-4d9jnh/The-World/?center=47.24754%2C35.96924&zoom=9)",

They are so much closer to Krimena and Savato, a combined push from the 9th and 10th corp in my opinion would of be a lot more devastating and in my opinion would of been more successful, capturing any of these two towns would of cut Russian GLOC's and would of forced they to retreat much further into Donetsk, it would of lead to the Russians abandoning Siverierdonesk/Lyschansk and would likely to lead to a brake through and set up future counter offensives to capture luhansk city and region.
