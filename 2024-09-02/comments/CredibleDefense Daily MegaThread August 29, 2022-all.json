Although it\u2019s a cool photo, what\u2019s interesting is the donated Dutch YPR-765\u2019s, seen in the photo. These were donated months ago, however they hadn\u2019t been seen in any frontline footage up until now. They had been seen in videos of Ukrainian units training behind the front line, but scarcely elsewhere. Also, it seems like this unit might be one of the newly formed brigades that Ukraine stood up after the invasion. Since the units operating the YPR\u2019s also had Polish donated tanks and some of the British supplied tracked vehicles, which also haven\u2019t been seen very much on the front. Which, is why I believe that some of the units taking part in this counter offensive may be the newly formed brigades we have been hearing about.\n\nHope to see more footage from the Ukrainian side in Kherson so we can come to a better conclusion.",

The report also states that the 24th needed 300 replacements to bring the brigade back to full strength, about 10% of muster.

However, even here the enemy carried out an attack not from the bridgehead itself (from where it was expected), but from behind the Ingulets River on a newly erected pontoon bridge in the Andreevka area by forces of at least one motorized battalion with a company of tanks and a group of infantry fighting vehicles. \n\n>Having quickly broken through the front, the enemy divided his striking forces: the first group cut the highway to Blagodatovka and tried to  break into the village itself but was repulsed. \n\n>The second - went into a breakthrough on Sukhyi Stavok (which, according to available data, managed to capture immediately) and then - to cover Davydov Ford in the area of the village of Bruskinskoe. At the same time, the enemy tried to create a bridgehead near the village of Malaya Alexandrovka in order to launch a counter strike from there, covering Davydov Ford from the east. \n\n>His attacks in this area as of 14 o'clock were repelled with heavy losses in manpower and equipment. Malaya Alexandrovka is in our hands. Thus, the enemy managed to \"inflate a bubble\" on the southern bank of the Ingult, but failed to significantly expand its bridgehead in the eastern and western directions, which gives good opportunities for its defeat by our tightened reserves. \n\n>Currently, the advancing units of the Ukrov are engaged in aviation and artillery.

However, even here the enemy carried out an attack not from the bridgehead itself (from where it was expected), but from behind the Ingulets River on a newly erected pontoon bridge in the Andreevka area by forces of at least one motorized battalion with a company of tanks and a group of infantry fighting vehicles. </p>\n\n<p>Having quickly broken through the front, the enemy divided his striking forces: the first group cut the highway to Blagodatovka and tried to  break into the village itself but was repulsed. </p>\n\n<p>The second - went into a breakthrough on Sukhyi Stavok (which, according to available data, managed to capture immediately) and then - to cover Davydov Ford in the area of the village of Bruskinskoe. At the same time, the enemy tried to create a bridgehead near the village of Malaya Alexandrovka in order to launch a counter strike from there, covering Davydov Ford from the east. </p>\n\n<p>His attacks in this area as of 14 o&#39;clock were repelled with heavy losses in manpower and equipment. Malaya Alexandrovka is in our hands. Thus, the enemy managed to &quot;inflate a bubble&quot; on the southern bank of the Ingult, but failed to significantly expand its bridgehead in the eastern and western directions, which gives good opportunities for its defeat by our tightened reserves. </p>\n\n<p>Currently, the advancing units of the Ukrov are engaged in aviation and artillery. However, the battle has only just begun and the enemy is unlikely to limit itself to the blows already inflicted..</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Bad translation </p>\n\n<p>https://.me/strelkovii/3150</p>\n\n<p>t before .me</p>\n</div>",

Because all of my understanding on WW2 involves the US increasing military production by ridiculous amounts over the course of 2-3 years. It's practically a paragon of switching civilian production to military on a short notice. Like how Amercian auto industries ended up producing military equipment because the government sold contracts to whoever could spend the factories and production lines. Granted I'm not well researched in this area, so I'm definitely willing to reconsider, but that's an extraordinary claim on your part.\n\n\nAt any rate, speaking as a non-industrial engineer, the hardest part of setting up any process, material or otherwise, is figuring out what to do. That is to say, the initial R&D. After that, it's a matter of repeating the same process while also assuring quality. So, if you have two production lines for shells, adding two more is just a matter of repeating an existing process. And I would have a hard time believing that there aren't already plans being enacted to scale production to meet demand.

Because all of my understanding on WW2 involves the US increasing military production by ridiculous amounts over the course of 2-3 years. It&#39;s practically a paragon of switching civilian production to military on a short notice. Like how Amercian auto industries ended up producing military equipment because the government sold contracts to whoever could spend the factories and production lines. Granted I&#39;m not well researched in this area, so I&#39;m definitely willing to reconsider, but that&#39;s an extraordinary claim on your part.</p>\n\n<p>At any rate, speaking as a non-industrial engineer, the hardest part of setting up any process, material or otherwise, is figuring out what to do. That is to say, the initial R&amp;D. After that, it&#39;s a matter of repeating the same process while also assuring quality. So, if you have two production lines for shells, adding two more is just a matter of repeating an existing process. And I would have a hard time believing that there aren&#39;t already plans being enacted to scale production to meet demand. Ammunition is an old business that surely has figured this problem out decades ago.</p>\n</div>",

The biggest reason that no big, serious counteroffensive ever developed against the US in Iraq and Afghanistan is that it would be disrupted before it started, partly because of aerial superiority.

So officially after Minsk 2 it was regular army, although some 'volunteers' continued to be active in the ATO.\n\nSince Minsk 2 Ukraine has rotated different combat units through the trenches, to give them some combat experience. So most soldiers had at least 1 deployment in the trenches before 24 feb. These rotations were pretty long though (Around 6 months I believe Cossackgundi said).\n\nAn issue they had however is that in the last couple of years the Ukrainian army had a pretty big retention issue (More than ~~100 000~~  77000  UA soldiers not resigning another contract between 2018-2020). These were often the more experienced and 'specialized' soldiers. For this reason Ukrainian commanders who were gonna get their unit deployed in the ATO had to call around to ask former soldiers to sign short term contracts to fill gaps in their own units. (These were often specialized soldiers: Radio operators, snipers, medics, sappers etc). When deployed in the ATO Ukrainian soldiers made a lot of money, so these short term contracts were lucrative.\n\nI'll see if I can find the article about it, but it's kinda hard with the recent invasion drowning out 'old' news. \n\nEDIT:\n\n[77k UA soldiers resigning](https://jamestown.org/program/while-zelenskyy-promises-peace-ukraines-army-faces-serious-challenges/)",

Big Russian victory, smashing it and preventing Ukraine from taking significant territory. If this happens, I think the losses would be non-catastrophic for Ukraine, but would shape the war to be attrition for the foreseeable future as Ukraine would abandon offensive operations until something really changes\n2. Some sort of stalemate. I think this would just be massively intensified attrition for both sides with non significant amounts of territory shifting. In this case, I think we will just see a continuation of the norm and an another attempt some point in the future with more equipment and prep work. Probably the most likely outcome and in many cases it probably wouldn't be outwardly different to us than scenario one. \n3. Most hopeful outcome but probably least likely? Big Ukrainian victory. This ranges from forcing the Russians out of Kherson with minimal personal losses on both side but big equipment losses, to successfully eliminating a large chunk of the Kherson garrison. In this scenario, the effect would be great for propaganda, tactics, etc. Of course; if Russia withdrew in good order, then they will pass it off as some kind of wise decision, etc. Probably non catastrophic to the war but clearly shows that the stalement is not inevitable. The absolute worst case scenario for Russia would be Ukraine cutting off most of the Russian garrison in Kherson and forcing a surrender. I regard this outcome as very far fetched, but if this does happen, it would be a very significant development as it would prevent Russia from spinning the defeat as any form of intentional withdrawal. The result may be most profound because depending on how this outcome unfolds, it may redouble western resolve, back Putin into a corner, and generally just represent a generally unacceptable Russian defeat and loss of military strength. Again, not likely, but obviously the most explosive result that would likely trigger a whole new course to the war. \n\nThoughts?",

USSR/Russia is generally more hated by its former colonies and doesn&#39;t have a regimental army anyways; France, Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands seemingly didn&#39;t create as deeply rooted foreign regiments. Sweden had loyal units from Finland, some of which could have conceivably outlived a peaceful dissolution, but Russia took over in 1812.</p>\n</div>",
