        "body": ">[In Ukraine\u2019s capital, Putin\u2019s attacks don\u2019t dim the resolve to fight Russia](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/12/01/kyiv-mood-airstrikes-war-ukraine/)\n\n>War and winter have brought new misery to Kyiv after a long summer lull. Russia's missile campaign to destroy Ukraine's energy infrastructure has revived fears that had abated after Ukrainian forces drove Russian troops away from the capital in the spring.\n\n>The first snowfall of the season has brought subzero temperatures to a city plunged into darkness and cold by the attacks.\n\n>But if Russian President Vladimir Putin's goal is to demoralize the population to the point of accepting compromises with Russia, he isn't succeeding. The danger and discomfort appear only to be hardening attitudes, deepening the resolve to keep fighting, according to interviews with Kyiv residents.\n\n>>\"Emotionally it's very challenging when you are at home with no electricity and you can hear the air raid sirens,\" said drama student Anastacia Osmolovska, 20. \"It's like being in a deep black hole.\"\n\n>>\"But as long as Russia is firing missiles at our cities there's no way of negotiating with them,\" Osmolovska said. \"We have to keep the fear inside and carry on.\"\n\n>Missile monotony\n\n>Most Kyiv residents have become at least somewhat inured to the threat posed by the missiles. The wail of the sirens no longer triggers a rush for the shelters. People move away from the windows into corridors or interior rooms, then wait to see if there are explosions before deciding whether to move underground, Maria Birtec, 35, said as she sipped coffee with a friend in central Kyiv.\n\n>At the beginning of the war, her son, Max, now 4, trembled and cried at the sound of explosions, she recalled.\n\n>Now he has taken to shouting \"Kill Putin in his bunker\" when the sirens go off and shows no sign of fear. \"He's pretty chill,\" Birtec said.\n\n>For some, however, the attacks are an ongoing source of anxiety. Liliia Bolbat's twin teenage daughters were traumatized by a rocket strike on their apartment building in the eastern city of Mariupol during the 2014-2015 conflict. They live in Kyiv now, and the recent attacks have revived distressing memories.\n\n>On Oct. 10, a date all Kyivians have inscribed to memory because the missiles that rained down on the capital marked the launch of the new Russian campaign, \"the girls were so stressed they vomited and had fever,\" Bolbat said. \"They spent 12 hours in the basement.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/12/01/kyiv-mood-airstrikes-war-ukraine/\">In Ukraine\u2019s capital, Putin\u2019s attacks don\u2019t dim the resolve to fight Russia</a></p>\n\n<p>War and winter have brought new misery to Kyiv after a long summer lull. Russia&#39;s missile campaign to destroy Ukraine&#39;s energy infrastructure has revived fears that had abated after Ukrainian forces drove Russian troops away from the capital in the spring.</p>\n\n<p>The first snowfall of the season has brought subzero temperatures to a city plunged into darkness and cold by the attacks.</p>\n\n<p>But if Russian President Vladimir Putin&#39;s goal is to demoralize the population to the point of accepting compromises with Russia, he isn&#39;t succeeding. The danger and discomfort appear only to be hardening attitudes, deepening the resolve to keep fighting, according to interviews with Kyiv residents.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Emotionally it&#39;s very challenging when you are at home with no electricity and you can hear the air raid sirens,&quot; said drama student Anastacia Osmolovska, 20. &quot;It&#39;s like being in a deep black hole.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;But as long as Russia is firing missiles at our cities there&#39;s no way of negotiating with them,&quot; Osmolovska said. &quot;We have to keep the fear inside and carry on.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Missile monotony</p>\n\n<p>Most Kyiv residents have become at least somewhat inured to the threat posed by the missiles. The wail of the sirens no longer triggers a rush for the shelters. People move away from the windows into corridors or interior rooms, then wait to see if there are explosions before deciding whether to move underground, Maria Birtec, 35, said as she sipped coffee with a friend in central Kyiv.</p>\n\n<p>At the beginning of the war, her son, Max, now 4, trembled and cried at the sound of explosions, she recalled.</p>\n\n<p>Now he has taken to shouting &quot;Kill Putin in his bunker&quot; when the sirens go off and shows no sign of fear. &quot;He&#39;s pretty chill,&quot; Birtec said.</p>\n\n<p>For some, however, the attacks are an ongoing source of anxiety. Liliia Bolbat&#39;s twin teenage daughters were traumatized by a rocket strike on their apartment building in the eastern city of Mariupol during the 2014-2015 conflict. They live in Kyiv now, and the recent attacks have revived distressing memories.</p>\n\n<p>On Oct. 10, a date all Kyivians have inscribed to memory because the missiles that rained down on the capital marked the launch of the new Russian campaign, &quot;the girls were so stressed they vomited and had fever,&quot; Bolbat said. &quot;They spent 12 hours in the basement. I had to give them sedatives.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Since then, they have regularly slept in the corridor of their apartment in case of missile strikes. They keep flashlights, blankets and chocolate bars at the ready.</p>\n\n<p>But the girls said they would rather endure their fear than make concessions to Russia.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;How could we possibly negotiate with them when they destroyed our native city?&quot; Anhelina, one of the twins, said, referring to the badly bombed and now Russian-occupied city of Mariupol, where they were born.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;They do not deserve any mercy from our side,&quot; her sister, Karolina, said, clenching her jaw.</p>\n\n<p>The electricity cuts, meanwhile, add new challenges to life in the time of war.

                    "body": "The theological reasons has to do with the belief of bishopric authority, and organization of the church. \n\nIf you're catholic, it's easy, the Pope overrides everyone. \n\nIf you're Anglican, it's easy. You just make your own branch (looking at you Episcopalians)\n\nIf you're orthodox, it's complicated. Part of rejecting papal authority was a general rejection of the ability of bishops to regulate other bishops. Bishops being those who control a territory, like a city. You CANNOT ignore bishops in orthodoxy. The clergy is the source of sacraments, and required for a functional church (shared with Anglicans and Catholics). Removing the priests essentially means that there is NO church at all. However, in orthodoxy, there is still a general principle of \"delegated territory.\" That is, a bishop can delegate some of their territory to another bishop, and so there is a primate bishop who is in charge of everything in an area. The patriarch of Moscow is that person for Russia.\n\nHere's where the dispute begins. \nThe bishop of Constantinople, the biggest bishop in the orthodox world since they said goodbye to the pope, was the original primate of the Russian territory back in Roman days. \n\nWhen Russia got big, and needed an actual on duty primate, the bishop of Constantinople created the primate of Russia. At that time, it included Ukraine. \n\nNow that Ukraine is independent, there's a big issue.  You have 3 branches of orthodoxy, + 1 catholic. \n\n1. The Orthodox Church of Ukraine. Constantinople granted these bishops in 2019 independence from Moscow on the basis that it's still Constantinople's territory. Russia rejected this. Greek orthodoxy and Russian orthodoxy are now in schism (like Catholics and orthodox) due to this. \n\n2. The Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine. These were Ukrainian churches who vowed to be a part of the primate of Moscow, rather than be under the authority of Kyiv. The reason before 2019 was due to culture, etc (there was a Ukrainian subdivision in the russian Orthodox Church and an informal rebellion of Ukrainian bishops that group 1 primarily belonged to.) The reason after is because they did not recognize the authority of Constantinople to grant independence to the Ukrainian church. They declared independence from Moscow in 2022 because of the war. \n\n3. The remainder? People in branch 2 who still reject that Ukrainian churches have any authority to leave the Moscow branch of the church. People in this group make a passionate case that the bishop of Constantinople shouldn't be orthodox's version of the pope, and that him acting like one, or bishops acting in rebellion, is essentially Catholicism in disguise with a different pope. It's very clear how this can be sincere if you consider that the arguments used by group 1 and 2 could be used to support why the Pope should be in charge of orthodox churches, which obviously they disagree with.\n\n4. The catholic branch doesn't care about these issues because the pope long ago revoked bishopric authority to orthodox bishops (in the catholic perspective) and gave it over to eastern catholic primates; these primates are not the Catholics you may know. They act, look, and in every outward regard seem orthodox. The difference is that they respect the authority of the pope.

You just make your own branch (looking at you Episcopalians)</p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re orthodox, it&#39;s complicated. Part of rejecting papal authority was a general rejection of the ability of bishops to regulate other bishops. Bishops being those who control a territory, like a city. You CANNOT ignore bishops in orthodoxy. The clergy is the source of sacraments, and required for a functional church (shared with Anglicans and Catholics). Removing the priests essentially means that there is NO church at all. However, in orthodoxy, there is still a general principle of &quot;delegated territory.&quot; That is, a bishop can delegate some of their territory to another bishop, and so there is a primate bishop who is in charge of everything in an area. The patriarch of Moscow is that person for Russia.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s where the dispute begins. \nThe bishop of Constantinople, the biggest bishop in the orthodox world since they said goodbye to the pope, was the original primate of the Russian territory back in Roman days. </p>\n\n<p>When Russia got big, and needed an actual on duty primate, the bishop of Constantinople created the primate of Russia. At that time, it included Ukraine. </p>\n\n<p>Now that Ukraine is independent, there&#39;s a big issue.  You have 3 branches of orthodoxy, + 1 catholic. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The Orthodox Church of Ukraine. Constantinople granted these bishops in 2019 independence from Moscow on the basis that it&#39;s still Constantinople&#39;s territory. Russia rejected this. Greek orthodoxy and Russian orthodoxy are now in schism (like Catholics and orthodox) due to this. </p></li>\n<li><p>The Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine. These were Ukrainian churches who vowed to be a part of the primate of Moscow, rather than be under the authority of Kyiv. The reason before 2019 was due to culture, etc (there was a Ukrainian subdivision in the russian Orthodox Church and an informal rebellion of Ukrainian bishops that group 1 primarily belonged to.) The reason after is because they did not recognize the authority of Constantinople to grant independence to the Ukrainian church. They declared independence from Moscow in 2022 because of the war. </p></li>\n<li><p>The remainder? People in branch 2 who still reject that Ukrainian churches have any authority to leave the Moscow branch of the church. People in this group make a passionate case that the bishop of Constantinople shouldn&#39;t be orthodox&#39;s version of the pope, and that him acting like one, or bishops acting in rebellion, is essentially Catholicism in disguise with a different pope. It&#39;s very clear how this can be sincere if you consider that the arguments used by group 1 and 2 could be used to support why the Pope should be in charge of orthodox churches, which obviously they disagree with.</p></li>\n<li><p>The catholic branch doesn&#39;t care about these issues because the pope long ago revoked bishopric authority to orthodox bishops (in the catholic perspective) and gave it over to eastern catholic primates; these primates are not the Catholics you may know. They act, look, and in every outward regard seem orthodox. The difference is that they respect the authority of the pope. They have no issues with any of this because they never recognized the power of Moscow over them, and they believe in the absolute authority of the pope to organize the church with unlimited discretion. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It&#39;s unclear to me if zelensky is going after group 3 alone or also group 2, believing it to be too corrupt.</p>\n\n<p>Hope that helps.</p>\n</div>",

Ukraine's base load generators, like the nuclear power plants, coal plants, and hydroelectric plants, generate a relatively inflexible amount of power. In order to transmit this power efficiently it needs to be done at very high voltage to reduce transmission loss, and reduce the amount of conductor required. So high voltage lines need to be erected, and protected at termination points by specialized circuit breakers. Like ones Ukraine is specifically requesting, which are very specific types. The high voltage transmission lines run to transmission and larger distribution substations, at the distribution substations the voltage is stepped down to medium voltage. In some places like a large industrial complex this may be the end of the line, but for most uses these distribution stations will feed smaller substations where voltage is further stepped down. From there most of it feed into distribution transformers located closer to the end user which provide the last mile.",

But theyve also struggled with, for example, giving Marders. Not only have they resisted handing those systems over, but they blocked Rheinmetall from giving a few specimens they had as well. Germany has not been a strong or consistent supporter of Ukraine militarily, and has followed the rest of Europe rather than led. Also there is the diplomatic issue between Kyiv and Berlin, with the former ambassador to Kyiv being pretty petulant. Moreover in the case of the weapons they have given, there have been some serious issues with PZH2000's reliability, for example. One article linked here a couple days ago suggested that up to 30% of the given platforms have already gone down to maintenance issues, including both powerplant problems and barrel wear. This should be expected, even American barrels wear out. The issue is that despite the proximity to the factories which built the things, German industry is unable to rapidly refurbish or restore them nor apparently provide the spare parts to keep them in service. And this is a perennial issue with the Bundeswehr, which used 'just in time' logistics as an excuse not to buy spare parts. So even when there is the political will to transfer weapons, the logistics tail hasn't been there to keep them fighting. \n\nMeanwhile both the US and SK seem to have that part figured out, at least for now. With the US you wont have the same political issue, and American industry is more capable of walking and chewing gum. SK hasn't proven itself that way yet, but there they've maintained a large standing army for so long their industrial infrastructure is plausibly beyond that of Germany. \n\nAnd add one more wrinkle: German weapons had by and large not been tested before this war. Unlike American examples, there isn't a sterling reputation to trade on like with ie the Abrams. Even if you excuse the other two issues, if Ukraine is having trouble with German weapons in their first major outing, that is not good for the future of German arms sales.

More than 200 convicts will be employed at the state-run tank maker Uralvagonzavod.\n\n>**A third of companies lost some employees to the call-up, with nearly a fifth saying they haven\u2019t yet been able to replace them**, a November survey showed.

There are physically not enough people left!\u201d\n\n>The elderly, alongside women and teenagers, are also becoming an important source of workers, according to Danina. Migrants account for up to 10% of the local labor market, with Russia growing more reliant on them to expand the pool of low-skill labor.\n\n>Migration outflows have meanwhile continued since the start of the year, according to official data published Wednesday, with the number of those leaving Russia in the first nine months more than doubling and rising by more than 323,000.\n\n>Labor shortages may become a major vulnerability as Russia heads for a downturn likely to extend well into next year, especially as other parts of the economy come under pressure from sanctions imposed by the US and its allies.

It crossed into Russia and turned north across the Belgorod region, where Russia bases equipment to support its war in eastern Ukraine.\n\n>The drone spotted a base for Moscow's own unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), according to overhead images captured by the Ukrainians that were later reviewed by The Washington Post.\n\n>In one frame, a Russian Orlan-10, with a trademark propeller on its nose, could be seen sitting in the field beside a house. Then in an \"after\" photo, the house had a hole in its roof, and an ambulance could be seen driving up. A Ukrainian attack drone had followed the same route as the reconnaissance drone \u2014 and delivered a strike on the fleet of enemy \"eyes.\"\n\n>The attack, which has not been previously reported, dealt a blow to the Russian forces' ability to see the Ukrainian offensive coming and to counterattack.\n\n> Meanwhile, the Ukrainians deployed reconnaissance UAVs to mark the coordinates of Russian command posts, artillery batteries, electronic warfare systems and ammunition depots. Then, as Western-provided multiple-launch rocket systems fired on those targets, drones were flying again, redirecting the rocket fire in real time or confirming that it hit the mark. At times, combat drones delivered the blow themselves.\n\n>The Ukrainian strikes weakened the Russians and set the stage for Ukrainian soldiers to advance. When they did, drones were again hovering, allowing the operation's commander to monitor the troops' progress on a live stream. \"We had the full picture of the fight,\" said Col. Gen. Oleksandr Syrsky, commander of the Ukrainian ground forces.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n> Every Ukrainian soldier has had a scary encounter with a Russian Orlan-10 \u2014 Russia's premier reconnaissance drone, which also has electronic-warfare capabilities.\n\n>For Lt. Oleksandr Sosovskyy, a deputy battalion commander in Ukraine's 93rd Mechanized Brigade, his occurred in late April, while traveling with four soldiers to a village near the front line in the Kharkiv region. After parking their car between two houses, he heard an eerie buzzing overhead. They couldn't see their enemy, but the enemy could see them.\n\n>For the next several hours, shelling followed wherever they went. The soldiers tried to split up, moving around the village and ducking for cover. But the Orlan helped the Russians correct their fire. It was relentless and accurate. \"They were trying to destroy the car and obviously destroy us,\" Sosovskyy said.\n\n>In recent months, however, Sosovskyy has noticed there are fewer Orlans to fear. Before, the Russians would often have two flying at once \u2014 one for reconnaissance and one to correct artillery strikes. By summertime, hearing or seeing one, much less two, became rarer.\n\n>With the use of unmanned aircraft expanding, Ukraine and Russia are trying to ramp up domestic manufacturing of all types of drones. But a noticeable decline in Orlans has highlighted the challenges for Moscow on the production front.\n\n>The Orlan-10 is the Russian military's workhorse in the sky, but it's unclear how many are left. Many have been shot down, and there is little available data on production rates.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n> They heard the threat before they saw it.\n\n>As the rumbling drew closer, Ukrainian law enforcement officers in downtown Kyiv steeled themselves and raised their guns skyward, looking for the noise. When they spotted the white triangle through the clouds, they opened fire.\n\n>The Iranian-made Shahed drone, with an explosive warhead at its nose, \"is a moped in the sky,\" moving slowly and loudly before diving into its target, said Solovey, the head of air defense for Ukrainian ground forces.\n\n>The Shahed is Russia's solution to its domestic production woes \u2014 a powerful drone bought from another country ostracized by the West. Ukrainian officials said Moscow has recently ordered more from Tehran.\n\n>Kyiv and its Western allies say that Russia has bought hundreds of the Shahed-136 drones and that Iranian trainers have traveled to Ukraine to help operate them. The Shaheds debuted in Ukraine on Sept. 20 and initially were used to terrorize southern Ukraine.\n\n>The drones have since wreaked havoc all over the country.\n\n>When the Kyiv police officers fired their guns into the sky on Oct. 17, one drone was shot down, but four others struck near a power station. One hit a residential building, which split in half and collapsed. Five people were killed.\n\n>The Shahed has few metallic parts and flies low, making it difficult to detect. Expensive surface-to-air missile systems, such as an S-300 or Buk, can take them out, but doing so wastes resources that Kyiv would rather use against Moscow's high-precision missiles. Lately, Ukraine has scrambled fighter jets to shoot down Shaheds.\n\n>This frustrating choice is partly the point, said Aksenov, the Russian military expert \u2014 to exhaust Kyiv's resources while conserving Russia's own arsenal.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n> Homegrown drones range from miniature planes that can fly nearly 30 miles and drop a five-pound missile \u2014 such as the Punisher drone preferred by Ukraine's special forces \u2014 to reconnaissance gliders. The goal is to produce 2,000 small combat drones in Ukraine per month by year's end, said Fedorov, the digital minister.\n\n>Russia's failures, however, are not just due to lack of hardware. Its experience highlights how drone warfare requires not just advanced equipment but a modern mind-set for decision-making.\n\n>Russia's rigid chain of command requires soldiers on the ground to seek senior approval for strikes, said Pavel Aksenov, a military expert and reporter with the BBC's Russian service. So even when a Russian reconnaissance drone spots a target, by the time the go-ahead comes through, the target often has moved.",

I would suggest that Russia was planning to subsume Ukraine since at least the 2000s but it planned to do so through soft power/manipulating their government not through an invasion. Just think about what happened with Yanukovych when he tried to suddenly abandon the trade agreement with the EU in favor of stronger ties to Russia. \n\nI think the 2014 revolution forced Putin's hand though, and so he scrambled to find a way to take as much of Ukraine as possible. Seeing how weak Ukraine was in 2014, he began planning for a full scale invasion, but Russia's economy really took a hard hit after 2014 so he probably needed time to properly prepare for a full scale invasion. When he finally did invade, it was poorly planned because it was assuming Ukraine was just as weak as it was in 2014 and that collaborators in the Ukrainian government would help to bring down Ukraine within days, which obviously didn't work out.",

If Bakhmut was being done only for a stupid ass reason I don&#39;t think he&#39;d let that continue, he&#39;d shut that shit down. But it&#39;s performing a function, so he allows it.</p>\n</div>",

                        "body": "Which human wave assaults are you referring to? That term is turning into a meme to describe any failed dismounted infantry attack where more than three guys can be seen in drone footage getting schwacked by artillery. I'm not saying it hasn't happened, but it's not SOP.\n\nAnd why would any of the dozen or so brigades that belong to OC-S that were used in the Kherson bridgehead campaign be moved to reinforce Bakhmut? That's a strategic level redeployment and that's not what I was talking about, which are transfers within the Donbas front, within OC-E and corps equivalent ad hoc commands in that sector immediate operational area.\n\nFor instance, a few weeks ago (maybe a month?) the 93rd Mech Infantry brigade was sent to reinforce Bakhmut, and that is a top level mechanized unit that was used in the Kharkiv counteroffensive, before that was used on at least two previous counterattacks against Izyum, and before that was involved in counterattacks in Sumy during the first phase. IE, extremely capable at offensive ops. And now it's pulling defensive duties in a meat grinder battle, an environment that will help hurt it's offensive capabilities due to manpower and equipment losses doing static defense. But somebody with stars decided Bakhmut was worth that brigade doing that versus using its offensive skills against Svatove, Kreminna, or other locations.\n\nAnd that's just maneuver units. Who gets the limited number of artillery brigades in OC-E (which apparently are the ones using nearly all the western artillery pieces)? Who gets priority fires with tactical use of HIMARS in that area? Who gets priority resupply for artillery ammo? If Bakhmut becomes a political imperative to hold at all costs, by direction of Kyiv, it could become the main effort over other ongoing or planned operations going on in OC-E. Right now Russia's priority is defensive in Luhansk, one way to try to achieve that is conducting some supporting operations, such as a fixing operation or feint, to take attention away from their weakness.\n\nI'm not suggesting it'll work, UA has to bite at the bait. They've done so a little bit (shift the 93rd) but there is no evidence yet they have gone all in enough to screw with current or future ops. This isn't a legit emergency, social media won't shut up about it but it's actually not a big deal. \n\nIt's a cost ratio analysis. Is Russia taking heavy casualties in Bakhmut more detrimental to their war effort than if they didn't attack and that area turned into a quiet sector allowing the UAF to perform an economy of force defense to mass more troops elsewhere? Is the possibility they can use it as a diversion to limit the success of UAF offensive operations in the front? \n\nConsidering how utterly ruthless the Russian brass are, I think they'll make this sacrifice in a heartbeat if they think it even has an inkling of success, especially if it turns out it is legitimately Wagner mercenaries taking most of the casualties.",
                        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Which human wave assaults are you referring to? That term is turning into a meme to describe any failed dismounted infantry attack where more than three guys can be seen in drone footage getting schwacked by artillery. I&#39;m not saying it hasn&#39;t happened, but it&#39;s not SOP.</p>\n\n<p>And why would any of the dozen or so brigades that belong to OC-S that were used in the Kherson bridgehead campaign be moved to reinforce Bakhmut? That&#39;s a strategic level redeployment and that&#39;s not what I was talking about, which are transfers within the Donbas front, within OC-E and corps equivalent ad hoc commands in that sector immediate operational area.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, a few weeks ago (maybe a month?) the 93rd Mech Infantry brigade was sent to reinforce Bakhmut, and that is a top level mechanized unit that was used in the Kharkiv counteroffensive, before that was used on at least two previous counterattacks against Izyum, and before that was involved in counterattacks in Sumy during the first phase. IE, extremely capable at offensive ops. And now it&#39;s pulling defensive duties in a meat grinder battle, an environment that will help hurt it&#39;s offensive capabilities due to manpower and equipment losses doing static defense. But somebody with stars decided Bakhmut was worth that brigade doing that versus using its offensive skills against Svatove, Kreminna, or other locations.</p>\n\n<p>And that&#39;s just maneuver units. Who gets the limited number of artillery brigades in OC-E (which apparently are the ones using nearly all the western artillery pieces)? Who gets priority fires with tactical use of HIMARS in that area? Who gets priority resupply for artillery ammo? If Bakhmut becomes a political imperative to hold at all costs, by direction of Kyiv, it could become the main effort over other ongoing or planned operations going on in OC-E. Right now Russia&#39;s priority is defensive in Luhansk, one way to try to achieve that is conducting some supporting operations, such as a fixing operation or feint, to take attention away from their weakness.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not suggesting it&#39;ll work, UA has to bite at the bait. They&#39;ve done so a little bit (shift the 93rd) but there is no evidence yet they have gone all in enough to screw with current or future ops. This isn&#39;t a legit emergency, social media won&#39;t shut up about it but it&#39;s actually not a big deal. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s a cost ratio analysis.

If you remove the non combat losses from the KIA figures, then you also need to remove the non combat injuries' from the WIA figure - which still gives you a less than 10:1 ratio - unless you want to ague that ~20% of all KIA is non combat but less that 5% of WIA is non combat.  \n\n> Ukraine is fighting on their home turf - they are rarely outside an hour of a decently equipped hospital.\n\nNo, this is simply not true.  The distance from Snigurovka to the nearest hospital is 60KM, you think you can get to a WIA, load them (a very difficult process under fire, where often just getting to the person - much less moving them can be an incredible challenge) then move 60KM though an area with damaged roads, multiple checkpoints, and many blown and damaged bridges takes less than an hour?\n\nOr how about Svatove - where is your level 2 or 3 trauma center within an hour - without airlift?

(In short order because all else being equal Russian visually confirmed equipment losses are 3-4x of Ukrainian ones, Russian army historically suffers disproportionate losses compared to enemies that are tactically more adept/have a higher morale and because a ratio closer to 1 would favor Russia to an extent that would have made Ukrainian offensive battlefield success since September unlikely).\n\nAs a side note it seems that Ukrainian casualties roughly follow a 1-1-3 ratio.

It is possible that Russian losses are more of a 1-1-2 ratio due to allegedly worse battlefield medicine situation.\n\nI guesstimate 40-60 thousand Ukrainian permanent losses (20-30k KIA) and 80-180 thousand Russian permanent losses (40-90k KIA). The high-end estimate for Russian permanent losses would mean that after the summer recruitment drive (50k?), Wagner additions (10-20k), DNR/LNR scrapings (30k?) and roughly 80k mobiks in Ukraine, that Russian total manpower in Ukraine is on par or lower than it was at the moment of invasion.

Too much economic interdependence, too many personal ties, no truly convincing reasons to fight. \n\nEven many Russian military accounts have this general feeling in the runup to February 24- this was a bluff and a real war was impossible. When their artillery batteries started firing, they were almost as shocked as the people they were shelling.\n\nImo, this was in large part a side effect of Putin's desire to keep every part of his Ukrainian adventure short and low-key, like an expanded version of Crimea 2014. I read Russian news through translate before it all kicked off, and (as Girkin complained about often) there was almost no effort at all to prepare the Russian people for a real war. Certainly nothing like what we had in the US regarding Iraq in 2002, or during the runup to ODS in 1990. Easy to think that it wouldn't really happen if the entire Russian information establishment wasn't obviously preparing the people for it and even attacking people who said it would happen.

A lot of people, even ones who should&#39;ve known better, thought that big nation state war in Europe had become impossible for more concrete reasons, too. Too much economic interdependence, too many personal ties, no truly convincing reasons to fight. </p>\n\n<p>Even many Russian military accounts have this general feeling in the runup to February 24- this was a bluff and a real war was impossible. When their artillery batteries started firing, they were almost as shocked as the people they were shelling.</p>\n\n<p>Imo, this was in large part a side effect of Putin&#39;s desire to keep every part of his Ukrainian adventure short and low-key, like an expanded version of Crimea 2014. I read Russian news through translate before it all kicked off, and (as Girkin complained about often) there was almost no effort at all to prepare the Russian people for a real war. Certainly nothing like what we had in the US regarding Iraq in 2002, or during the runup to ODS in 1990. Easy to think that it wouldn&#39;t really happen if the entire Russian information establishment wasn&#39;t obviously preparing the people for it and even attacking people who said it would happen. Crazy thing to do in the runup to a big war, but brilliant if you want to surprise the world with a quick and almost bloodless operation.</p>\n</div>",
