If we take him at his word, that Ukraine must be Russia once more, the correct tactical decision is and has been to deploy nuclear weapons, the only thing that can balance the scales in favor of Russia once more. But the correct strategic decision, knowing such an action could destroy not only him but Russia and the human world, would be to accept defeat and begin a phased withdrawal from occupied territories.

        "body": "There was a comment last night/this morning that essentially talked about us trimming our optimistic views, and that we are somehow likely to head towards a frozen conflict. I would like to counter this view. \n\nFrozen conflicts are an abnormal state of war that is analogous to an unofficial (or sometimes official) stalemate where neither side has forsaken their claims and settle for a practical ceasefire. The vast majority of warfare in history is high intensity short duration conflicts. The minority is high intensity long duration conflicts. There's insurgences as well, but its clear that's not what this war is. The oddity is low intensity long term conflicts that are not partisan attacks in nature. The comment made seemingly (and pardon my simplification) the argument that offenses are going to be harder, mobilization is going to shore up defenses, and therefore we should expect to head to a frozen conflict where Russia will get an off ramp. This is a poor analysis because the tendency of conflicts is to transfer to long duration intense warfare. Ukraine understands if they don't keep pushing, they lose those territories. Russia hasn't accomplished its war goals. Neither side is willing to stalemate. If there is a stagnation, the conflict will transform to a world war 1 western front scenario, not a Donbas 2017 scenario. These two outcomes are on opposites of the spectrum.  \n\nThe comment kind of blended long term intensity conflicts with frozen conflicts, but they are not at all interchangeable. The key distinction is sustainability. No country can sustain a long term high intensity for a very long time, while frozen conflicts are very sustainable. This war is not sustainable long term for Russia for 3 crucial reasons:\n\n1. The most important is equipment. I made a comment on this a few weeks ago, but the summary is that cheap mass production of equipment is not a reality anymore like it was in world war 2. You either have quality equipment, or mass made equipment, and due to things such as NLAWs, the latter is far less useful than 70 years ago. It's likely Russia cannot produce much of either, but the key here is realizing that mobilization is not a silver bullet because while you can flood the field with 300,000 men, you cannot make even 300 more T-90s on short notice. Like the knights and horse archers of the medieval period, equipment is largely prohibitively expensive, and losing it in the amounts Russia has means they will not be able to replenish it during this war. This bodes poorly for a long term intensity conflict. \n\n\n2. Affordability and logistics: the Russian economy is declining more, and more everyday, and the war is increasingly bringing a larger toll on it. A war economy historically has worked because the assumption is that there will be an opportunity to rebuild after the conflict. There is no such opportunity for russia. There cannot be a long term intensity conflict that russia survives well-off in economically, and even if it slows in intensity, the likelihood is that the Russian economy is going to continue on its decline. This is not sustainable. The Russian approach has been to put off the visible pain as long as possible, but as time goes on, it will be felt, and felt severely.\n\n\n3. For Ukraine, as long as western support continues which admittingly is a big if, the war is sustainable both from an equipment and economic standpoint. For the west, the war is sustainable. 10% of NATO's GDP is far more than the entire Russian economy. \n\nIn short, a long term intensity conflict favors Ukraine. This is ever the more reason to not allow this conflict to freeze. \n\nShould we expect a Russian rout before next summer? No. But the alternative is not a frozen conflict, the alternative is a long term conflict with high intensity that favors Ukraine.",

A war economy historically has worked because the assumption is that there will be an opportunity to rebuild after the conflict. There is no such opportunity for russia. There cannot be a long term intensity conflict that russia survives well-off in economically, and even if it slows in intensity, the likelihood is that the Russian economy is going to continue on its decline. This is not sustainable. The Russian approach has been to put off the visible pain as long as possible, but as time goes on, it will be felt, and felt severely.</p></li>\n<li><p>For Ukraine, as long as western support continues which admittingly is a big if, the war is sustainable both from an equipment and economic standpoint. For the west, the war is sustainable. 10% of NATO&#39;s GDP is far more than the entire Russian economy. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In short, a long term intensity conflict favors Ukraine. This is ever the more reason to not allow this conflict to freeze. </p>\n\n<p>Should we expect a Russian rout before next summer? No. But the alternative is not a frozen conflict, the alternative is a long term conflict with high intensity that favors Ukraine.</p>\n</div>",

Don't believe me? Try teaching yourself to do both and tell me how long it took you to master both. It won't take you long to realize the incredible difficulty to do one over the other, and then ask yourself what if everyone in town had to get burger meat vs king shrimp and special rice that only that one Italian store sells?

Examples of this for this drone are their slow speed, the loudness of engine, the dependency on command drones, etc. Once a counter is made against any of those, then mass producing them is very cost inefficient due to ease of destruction, while countering counters is cost prohibitive because it destroys your ability to mass produce. \n\n\nYour last comment shows your lack of knowledge on recent modern history. In the iran Iraq war, you saw what you describe, which is an absolute slog where things began to descend to lower quality besides by resupply. However, in the gulf war, you saw that the tech difference between American and Iraqi forces was not a difference of a 20% improvement, or 10% loss reduction, but rather complete blowouts of Iraqi military. The difference when American and Soviet equipment was very near peer (Korea and Vietnam) vs when American tech took a gigantic lead during Soviet stagnation (gulf war onwards) has been night and day. The Iraqi military, which operated on only slightly outdated Soviet tech, was effectively annihilated for almost no American losses. In a modern American and Russian conventional war, the difference wouldn't be 1000 abram losses and 2000 Russian tank losses, it would be about 10 Abrams, and the entire Russian military decimated.",

It was absolutely decimated and to show you tech differences, I will highlight 2 areas for you as Americans decimated contemporary Soviet equipment. \n\n1. The air and precision munitions campaign gave allies air supremacy, a fact that would become a crushing blow throughout the battle. the complexity, precision, and attacks of American aircraft was eons ahead of Russia's capability in 2022. This video really shows you the difference, and you only need to think of what happened in February to realize the incredible difference of stealth and precision munitions. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zxRgfBXn6Mg\n\n2. Abrams weren't just better than Soviet tanks, they crushed them categorically. Read this article for an in-depth analysis https://www.gao.gov/assets/nsiad-92-94.pdf\n\nThere's a lot more I can give you, but if you seriously consider just these two, then you will see the world of difference that extends to every aspect of the military. \n\nYou spout something out about \"morale\" but it's not a morale issue when your tank is totally incapable of destroying an Abrams. It causes terrible morale, but you have the causes reversed. Abrams effectively sniped contemporary soviet tanks, and survived damage. It wasn't a case of 90 abrams lost to 110 t-72, it was a case of 1 abrams damaged to 400 Iraqi tanks lost. You can pump 1000 t-72s out, but if that's the ratio, you just lose.  \n\nDo I think if the US invaded that they would crush Ukraine? Yes. Why? \n1. Massive air campaign which is systemic to American doctrine would crush Ukrainian defenses. \n2. Intel means that any valuable equipment, such as mass tank formations, would be systemically hunted down. \n3. American armored divisions would be effectively unstoppable. \n\nIt's not a mere morale issue when your army gets dunked on by precision munitions, unparalleled intel, and essentially unstoppable enemy attacks. \n\nYour last comment has no basis in reality and instead relies on an assumption that wars will just simply work like world war 2 does. We are trying to explain to you why that can't be the case. The reason why is because we've seen second class equipment get destroyed by the thousands by first class equipment for virtually 0 losses, and that things that previously were an issue (think of how the USAF never gained supremacy in Vietnam while 20 years later they decimated Iraq) are no longer. I would be surprised if you could name any so-called big long wars that fit your example except the Second World War which I've gone over multiple times. \n\nIn short, you have no basis for your claim about somehow being able to simplify mainline equipment and mass produce it except from a war from 80 years ago, where they did not simplify equipment because the best equipment was very simple.\n\nAlso, drones aren't niche, but Shahed drones are. They are literally incredible loud, slow moving, and depend on external factors for their highest levels of precision. You haven't taken the time to read up on them if you didn't realize that they are incredibly slow and loud, two factors that you can't just \"simplify away\" (you'd need to make it considerably more complex to get rid of that) and that those two factors alone could easily provide the basis for destroying very large numbers of them for cheap (literally well places aerial microphones and literal world war 2 spitfires would be able to detect and destroy them). It's their small number that makes the required investment unreasonable. If you're talking about putting an industry behind it, you'll quickly see them have a 90% fail rate for targets like Odesa. \n\nAlso, one last time, the American military budget is literally 66% of Russia's GDP. Even if we followed your most optimistic assumptions, the west needs to scale production to 2/10 to match Russia's 11/10. And even then, 20% of the western economy would be about 5.4 times greater than 100% of the russian economy. There's simply no way for Russia to win an attritional equipment war if the west doesn't want them to.\n\nAnd seriously, do you really think that the US willingly spends so much on its military so it's only slightly better?\n\nGDP figures are real.",

Since military ones are probably likely to be targeted (and carry tanks and other heavy equipment) they will likely be on the lighter end of things. lets say 100 cars for the sake of argument. and for the sake of this argument lets say 40% are carrying 2 T64's and another 20% are carrying BTR 80's then we have another 20% carrying 2000 Tons of ammo and the final 20% is 1000 Tons of diesel fuel for the vehicles.\n\nTo keep this simple we will assume each car weighs 125 tons at dead weight (Without cargo). so doing the math gets all those cars and their cargo weighing around 16,584 tons + the average weight of a cargo train engine (120-225 Tons we will use the heavier since its pulling alot of cargo)\n\nThat comes out to 16,809 Tons for the whole train. So if you then do the math I talked about for safe loads you would get:\n\n1/16th cargo removed: 15,758.4375 Tons\n\n1/8th cargo removed: 14,707.875 Tons\n\n1/2 cargo removed: 8,409.5 Tons\n\nTake all of this with a grain of salt though I did this just for the sake of answering the question somehow.

Since military ones are probably likely to be targeted (and carry tanks and other heavy equipment) they will likely be on the lighter end of things. lets say 100 cars for the sake of argument. and for the sake of this argument lets say 40% are carrying 2 T64&#39;s and another 20% are carrying BTR 80&#39;s then we have another 20% carrying 2000 Tons of ammo and the final 20% is 1000 Tons of diesel fuel for the vehicles.</p>\n\n<p>To keep this simple we will assume each car weighs 125 tons at dead weight (Without cargo). so doing the math gets all those cars and their cargo weighing around 16,584 tons + the average weight of a cargo train engine (120-225 Tons we will use the heavier since its pulling alot of cargo)</p>\n\n<p>That comes out to 16,809 Tons for the whole train. So if you then do the math I talked about for safe loads you would get:</p>\n\n<p>1/16th cargo removed: 15,758.4375 Tons</p>\n\n<p>1/8th cargo removed: 14,707.875 Tons</p>\n\n<p>1/2 cargo removed: 8,409.5 Tons</p>\n\n<p>Take all of this with a grain of salt though I did this just for the sake of answering the question somehow. In hindsight maybe the math wasn&#39;t worth it...</p>\n</div>",

Good thing he blew his cover quite early by claiming that the \"US invaded Korea\".\n\nWhere do these guys come from? The other day, I got downvoted heavily for stating an obvious fact that \"China is an imperial power\".\n\nEdit: u/sponsoredcommenter apparently thinks that the CCP wasn't in power when the Chinese overran Korea, including Seoul. Or that Truman was in power when Beijing invaded Vietnam in the 70s.

And why the ruling party hasn't changed since 1948?

Surovikin has been in command of the southern Army Group since June. Some notes on Surovikin:\n\n\\- During the 1991 August Coup, Surovikin was the captain of the 1st Rifle Battalion of  2nd Guards Tamanskaya Motor Rifle Division. He infamously followed an order to lead his troops into a demonstrators' barricade in a tunnel on Moscow's B Ring road, resulting in the death of several protestors. He was arrested at the conclusion of the clue but Boris Yeltsin had him released because he was following orders.\n\n\\- Surovikin has been involved in at least two different incidents with fellow officers. In 2004 he was accused of beating up Lieutenant Colonel Viktor Chibizov over a political disagreement. A month later Colonel Andrei Shtakal shot himself in the same room as Surovikin and another officer after Surovikin criticized him. In neither case was Surovikin found guilty of anything.\n\n\\- Surovikin served in command in Syria, from March 2017 to November 2017, after which he was made a Hero of the ~~Soviet Union~~ Russian Federation and Commander of the Russian Aerospace Forces. In January 2019, Surovikin took command again until April 2019. Both his tenures in command were considered successful, especially his initial stretch, when Russian media credited him with turning the war around.\n\n\\- In 2021, Surovikin was made a General of the Army, a high and exclusive rank, and it was speculated among Russia watchers and Russian media that he would be an eventual successor to Chief of the General Staff Gerasimov.\n\n\\- Since June 2022, Surovikin has commanded the souther army group of the Russian SMO. (He was added to the European Union sanction list in February).\n\n\\- ISW notes that Surovikin's appointment has been met with excitement among milbloggers and by Prigozhin, who considers him a true Russian man of action. Kadyrov also considers him a good choice.\n\n\\- In his most recent podcast with Dmitri Aleprovitch, Michael Kofman describes Surovikin as a \"Ruthless hothead, known for having a temper, and known for being a very stern officer... he is also seen as competent.\"",

A single F-35 can carry 8 SDBs internally, and those have a range of 110 km. If it carries bombs externally as well (if air defense is suppressed and air superiority is available, as part of a strike package with jamming support, or by dumping all the bombs, dumping them quickly, and fleeing), it can carry 32 SDBs, giving it the ability to deliver as much firepower as 5 HIMARs, and I think fighters typically sortie twice a day.

Rail connection + Road connection, and easily defensible for Ukraine in the future. It will serve an excellent jumping off point for future operations.\n\nI really think that their operations in the North are a waste of time post Kupansk, and they need to be shifting to a strategic defense and making their main effort Zaporizhzhia. \n\nMy reasoning is follows: \n\n1. They need to start pushing back towards the coast, incase the conflict ends prematurely. \n2. They need to try and reclaim that area to put additional pressure on Kherson.\n3. There is lots of villages and terrain to dig in at if they need to go defensive. Especially if you establish  your main defensive line on the Velyka Bilozerka River.\n4. Putting Tokmak in the crosshairs also allows for future operations west towards Enerhodar and Mykhailivka. The rivers and terrain will serve as a good defensive line. With a view of a follow on operation to recapture and set a defensive position on the Rohachyk river. \n5. Getting a foothold across the Molochna River will help for future operations against Melitopol.\n6. Increases strain on Kherson and puts Russian LOC's at risk.\n7.

Pushing the Russians back to the Crimean border is also the best bet, as they can be bottled up there a lot easier. \n\nIf they can capture a line from Tokmak / Melitopol / Nova Kakhova /Kherson (Ideally having cleared back to Crimea), while maintaining a defensive posture along all fronts, they should be able to better prepare for more major offensives next summer, with a view to recapture Berdyans'k /Mariupol, and a more broad front operation to generally move back to the Feb Borders.\n\nThat's my, appreciation of the situation.",

I don&#39;t know. </p>\n\n<p>But on the other side of this, the group that carried out the bombing probably wanted to knock the rail line out of service if possible--since that is the most significant military part of the brigde. Maybe it wasn&#39;t possible and they went ahead with the attack for its psychological impact. Or maybe they thought they could knock it out of service for an extended time and failed. </p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t know, but I&#39;m getting very different assessments from people who claim to know what they are talking about.</p>\n</div>",

A senior Ukrainian official corroborated Russian reports that Ukraine was behind the attack. The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of a government ban on discussing the blast, added that Ukrainian\u2019s intelligence services had orchestrated the explosion, using a bomb loaded onto a truck being driven across the bridge.\n\n>For President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who presided over the bridge\u2019s opening in 2018, the explosion was a highly personal affront, underscoring his failure to get a handle on a relentless series of Ukrainian attacks.\n\n>The explosion is emblematic of a Russian military in disarray. Russian forces were unable to protect the bridge, despite its centrality to the war effort, its personal importance to Mr. Putin and its potent symbolism as the literal connection between Russia and Crimea.\n\n>Hours after the explosion, the Kremlin appointed Gen. Sergei Surovikin, yet another new commander, to oversee its forces in Ukraine. Previous leadership shake-ups have done little to right the military\u2019s floundering performance.\n\n>The full extent of the damage was not immediately clear. The bridge has sections for train and automobile traffic. By Saturday evening, the railroad section of the bridge had undergone repairs and a train with 15 cars had successfully crossed the span, according to a Russian state news agency, Tass. Car traffic had also resumed on the undamaged side of the bridge, the head of Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, said in a post on Telegram.\n\n>Even so, Russian officials and hard-line military bloggers were already calling for revenge, with one member of Crimea\u2019s Parliament warning that anything less than an \u201cextremely harsh\u201d response would show weakness.\n\n>Any serious impediment to traffic on the bridge could have a profound effect on Russia\u2019s ability to wage war in southern Ukraine, where Ukrainian forces have been fighting an increasingly effective counteroffensive. The bridge is the primary military supply route linking Russia with the Crimean Peninsula. Without it, analysts said, the Russian military will be severely limited in its ability to bring fuel, equipment and ammunition to Russian units fighting in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, two of the four Ukrainian provinces that Mr. Putin announced Russia had annexed on Sept. 30.\n\n>Russia\u2019s National Anti-Terrorism Committee said in a statement that a truck had exploded on the automobile side of the bridge, igniting seven fuel cisterns being pulled by a train on a parallel rail line headed in the direction of Crimea.\n\n>It was unclear if the driver of the truck, who died in the blast, was aware there were explosives inside. In video captured by a surveillance camera on the bridge, a huge fireball is seen, seeming to consume several vehicles. A small sedan and a tractor-trailer truck driving side by side appear at the epicenter of the blast. The explosion caused two sections of the bridge to partly collapse.\n\n>For the Ukrainians, the explosion \u201cis not necessarily a decisive victory, but the balance of war often turns on an accumulation of lesser victories,\u201d said Ben Barry, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a research group based in London. \u201cIt is another ratchet of the pressure on President Putin.\u201d\n\n>While there were no official claims of responsibility, Ukrainian officials, who in the past have said the bridge would be a legitimate target for a strike, indicated that the explosion was no accident and made no secret of their satisfaction.\n\n>\u201cCrimea, the bridge, the beginning,\u201d Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine\u2019s president, wrote in a Twitter post on Saturday. \u201cEverything illegal, must be destroyed. Everything stolen returned to Ukraine. All Russian occupiers expelled.\u201d\n\n>Ukraine\u2019s domestic intelligence agency, the Security Service of Ukraine, known by its Ukrainian acronym S.B.U., issued a statement rephrasing a stanza of a poem by Ukraine\u2019s national poet, Taras Shevchenko. \u201cDawn, the bridge is burning beautifully,\u201d the agency posted on Twitter. \u201cA nightingale in Crimea meets the S.B.U.\u201d\n\n>President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine seemed to allude to the attack when he noted in his nightly address that Saturday \u201cwas a good and mostly sunny day\u201d in Ukrainian territory. \u201cUnfortunately, it was cloudy in Crimea,\u201d he said.\n\n>The Kremlin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, referred to the episode as an \u201cemergency\u201d in a statement on Saturday. He said that Mr. Putin, who had celebrated his 70th birthday on Friday, had been briefed.\n\n>\u201cThe president directed the prime minister to form a government commission to find out the causes of the incident and eliminate the consequences as soon as possible,\u201d Mr. Peskov said, according to Russian state media.\n\n>Occupation officials in Crimea left little doubt about who they thought was responsible.\n\n>\u201cUkrainian vandals were able to reach the Crimean bridge with their bloody hands,\u201d said Vladimir Konstantinov, the head of Crimea\u2019s Kremlin-installed Parliament.\n\n>In recent weeks, military traffic heading across the bridge into Crimea has increased, as Russia has raced tanks and artillery equipment to the front lines in the Kherson region, a fertile slice of southern Ukraine that the Kremlin\u2019s forces occupied in the first weeks of the war.\n\n>Ukrainian forces have stepped up their counteroffensive in the region, recapturing significant amounts of land in an effort to drive Russian forces east across the Dnipro River and liberate the city of Kherson, the only regional Ukrainian capital that Russian forces control.\n\n>Without the Kerch Strait Bridge, particularly the railroad section, the Kremlin would have few good options for supplying these troops with fuel and military equipment from their stocks in Russia, analysts said. Ferrying supplies by ship or plane to Crimea would be much more cumbersome, experts said. And a possible alternative overland supply route using southern Ukrainian territory seized by Russian forces would be vulnerable to Ukrainian attack and require the use of trucks, as there are no functioning rail lines.\n\n>\u201cEssentially all heavy military traffic passed through the bridge, tanks, artillery and so on,\u201d said Konrad Muzyka, a military analyst with Roshan Consulting.\n\n>In a statement, Russia\u2019s defense ministry said troops in southern Ukraine would be supplied \u201cfully and without interruption\u201d by ground and sea, though it did not explain how this might be accomplished.\n\n>Ukraine\u2019s monthlong blitz to retake territory from retreating Russian forces in the northeast of the country continued on Saturday, and Russia stepped up its bombardments of civilian infrastructure from the air.\n\n>Almost at the same time, Russian shelling also damaged the last line connecting the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to Ukrainian energy systems, cutting it off from the power grid that is used to cool its reactors. The plant, Europe\u2019s largest, has been disconnected from external power at least twice before, forcing it to rely on diesel generators to power safety equipment.\n\n\n>Whether or not Ukraine takes responsibility for the bridge blast, the episode is redolent of other attacks carried out by Ukrainian forces against targets that were highly symbolic and showcased Ukraine\u2019s military ingenuity in the face of a much stronger, more heavily armed Russian military.\n\n>In April, two Ukrainian-made Neptune cruise missiles, a weapon system that had never before been used in battle, slammed into the hull of the Moskva, the flagship of Russia\u2019s Black Sea fleet. The strike set off a series of explosions that eventually caused the cruiser to sink, killing an unknown number of sailors, including possibly the ship\u2019s captain.\n\n>The bridge allowed easier access to Crimea not only for Russian tourists, but also for Russia\u2019s military, which transported weapons and equipment into the peninsula in the years before February\u2019s invasion.\n\n>It was from Crimea that Russian forces attacked southern Ukraine, quickly gobbling up large swaths of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions in the Kremlin\u2019s most successful operation in the war to date.\n\n>But, as the attack on the bridge underscored, that success seems increasingly imperiled.\n\n>After the explosion, Russian officials, along with the country\u2019s increasingly bellicose military bloggers, did not wait for confirmation that Ukraine was responsible, calling for a swift and devastating response.\n\n>\u201cIf this time, we do not respond or do not respond just so, it will show definitively that we are weak,\u201d said Sergei Mironov, the leader of a pro-Kremlin political party. \u201cThis extreme audacity requires an extremely harsh response.\u201d",

The strike set off a series of explosions that eventually caused the cruiser to sink, killing an unknown number of sailors, including possibly the ship\u2019s captain.</p>\n\n<p>The bridge allowed easier access to Crimea not only for Russian tourists, but also for Russia\u2019s military, which transported weapons and equipment into the peninsula in the years before February\u2019s invasion.</p>\n\n<p>It was from Crimea that Russian forces attacked southern Ukraine, quickly gobbling up large swaths of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions in the Kremlin\u2019s most successful operation in the war to date.</p>\n\n<p>But, as the attack on the bridge underscored, that success seems increasingly imperiled.</p>\n\n<p>After the explosion, Russian officials, along with the country\u2019s increasingly bellicose military bloggers, did not wait for confirmation that Ukraine was responsible, calling for a swift and devastating response.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf this time, we do not respond or do not respond just so, it will show definitively that we are weak,\u201d said Sergei Mironov, the leader of a pro-Kremlin political party. \u201cThis extreme audacity requires an extremely harsh response.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Nor do I believe Putin is restraining himself out of good will if anything I think he wont do it since it emboldens NATO to provide more material support.\n\nHowever that reasoning has not stopped these attacks before. We've seen Russians doing (in my opinion) many things that are counter productive throughout this war.\n\nUsing weapons on non military targets of no importance or on occasion simply motivating the enemy more.

However, this ammunition is also considerably heavier, adding to the modern soldier's already heavy load and limiting their ability to carry other kinds of useful equipment.\n\nWhat if instead of upgrading all riflemen to a full cartridge, we instead unify the intermediate carbine and pistol cartridges with something similar to 5.7x28? You can increase the pressure, use a slightly wider telescoped polymer casing, and achieve similar performance to 5.56 out of a round which could fit in a handgun while also being significantly lighter than 5.56. It may not be effective at piercing high-tier plate armor, but realistically given the scarcity of tungsten (plus its China-centric production) and the political infeasability of using depleted uranium, you would not expect most of your riflemen to even be issued AP ammunition anyways.\n\nAnother factor in the NGSW's choice is based developments in optics, since >6x magnification is now viable for mass issue you can plausibly have every rifleman able to make use of the increased range. However, it is also the case that the vast, vast majority of combat encounters will still be decided by artillery, PGMs, and IFVs, all of which are still going to well outrange and outgun any infantry. Since the primary role of the infantryman has shifted towards spotting targets and relying on support from combined arms, it may be more prudent to instead give them something merely sufficient for close quarters engagements and prioritize weight. The weight savings, if not passed onto their spines and knees, can allow them to have access to more specialized ordinance like portable drones, ATGMs, or MANPADS which would make them less reliant on support, if the situation requires it.\n\nWould this approach be viable? If so, why do you think that the NGSW program hasn't entertained it? The cynic in me sees the program as a reincarnation of the 1960s Ordinance Board's obsession with the M14 over the AR15, this time as a manifestation of not corruption but rather the \"rifleman\" culture embedded in senior Army cadre, but maybe I'm just salty because I didn't even get marksman last time I qualified.",

The automatic rifleman _already_ runs 5.56 same as the riflemen, whether it's through an M27 or an M249.

The USMC already has \"every rifleman a marksman\" with the M27 (5.56) and a scope; the Army doesn't formally have marksmen at squad level, though most riflemen have an ACOG, and the NGSW is likely moving them closer to the USMC's IAR model. DMRs at squad level, when issued, have historically often been M16s (5.56). When they've been 7.62, there haven't really been any indications that ammo is a major problem - good marksmen don't burn through ammo the way a machinegunner does. All branches continue to accept new 7.62 DMRs.\n\nInstead, the move to the heavier round was partly inspired by a desire to improve performance at long range (Afghanistan) and against peer plate armour (Russia, in theory, and China). Keeping a 5.56ish round doesn't really help with that.\n\nThey also want to keep a unified rifle/squad MG round. The logistics burden of SAW ammo is far greater than that of pistol ammo, especially given that most soldiers who have pistols never even use them. No one is going to be interested in going _down_ from 5.56 for a SAW, but they still want to have commonality with the rifle supplies, a lot more than they want commonality with relatively limited and low-priority pistol supplies. So the primary requirements here are \"more bang\" and \"same round for rifle and MG\", which doesn't really leave a lot of room for a smaller round that no one is going to want to put in their MG.",

At the very least 7.62 is a common MG calibre so it&#39;s used for all your platoon MGs and vehicle MGs etc as well.)</p>\n\n<p>Pistol ammo is proportionally peanuts - each guy carries maybe 2 15-17rd mags each, if at all, and probably never shoots any. Logistically speaking, unifying the pistol calibre is worthless. It occupies a tiny fraction of overall logistics resources and if push came to shove, you could pretty safely drop it completely. The drawbacks you would take on by bringing rifles down to something that fits in a pistol are just not worth it for the miniscule gain.</p>\n</div>",

Both use both ammo types - 7.62 and 5.56, as well as 40mm grenades, disposable and reusable AT launchers, both group verrrrrrry similar, except two of those carry sustained fire kits for their GPMGs to allow for indirect fire. For the sake of argument, we're going to talk dismounted only for a moment. \n\nEach rifle, around 300 rounds of 5.56, in a mix of cartons and magazines. Dumping a few additional boxes doesn't add too much either, even if you went to 450 rounds.\n\nWith a C9/M249/Minimi, you're going to load your gunner with.......4 boxes of ammo ish. Two of these per the remaining 6 people - for 8 boxes of 200 rounds (1600 rds), 6 people remaining. Each person carries an additional 2 boxes of ammo and you're at 1200 rounds to redistribute, let's give your commander and 2nd in command a third box, and you have 1600 more rounds.\n\nCouple in your M240/C6/GPMG, Gunner carries the gun, and 200 rounds, the loader carries the tripod, spare barrel and an additional 600 rounds. This leaves you with.......800 rounds. 400 rounds per section (to be dumped with the Platoon Sergeant/Warrant), gives you 800 rounds for 1600. Give the Sergeant/Warrant an additional 400 rounds and you're at 2000 rounds.\n\nSame with Carl Gustav. Gunner and loader, Gunner carries the launcher + rifle, loader carries 2 rounds. Add in another 4-6 spread through the platoon and you're at 8 rounds. Switch Carl G for MILAN/SPIKE/Javelin (Although I see Javelin used more as a section weapon) if you like, the same principle applies. \n\nSo each section would have to carry:\n\n2-4 Rockets/ATGM  \n1200 rounds of LMG ammo  \n400 rounds of GPMG ammo  \nIndividual load of Small arms ammunition/ grenades / pyro.  \nN Spare radio batteries.\n\nIf you need, more than that, as a line infantry platoon, then obviously, you dump it forward (The fabled double combat load?), or you're in it deep. If you're mounted, you should have additional ammunition on your transport for immediate replenishment. \n\nConsolidation is a battle drill, where you should be reporting ammunition requirements, in order to have the ammo pushed forward from the company level, to be replaced either as a part of the daily replenishment, or as an urgent replenishment of ammo.\n\nLet's also remember, that you're looking at 3-6 tonnes total of ammunition/day for a Battalion, across all types for small arms, which is tiny in comparison to cannon ammunition (.50 cal and up) to artillery rounds and defensive stores.",

From the perspective of someone with more experience in artillery/ordinance, would you say that these types of drones are likely to become an important part of infantry operations? If so, is it simply expected that there will be a low-flying C2 aircraft for them to route through or will they be expected to operate more autonomously?",
