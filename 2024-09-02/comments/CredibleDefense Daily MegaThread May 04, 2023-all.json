I was having trouble confirming that the brigades transferred from the National Guard are fully mechanized, but even that has fallen into place: The 1st Special Purpose Brigade certainly has tanks https://militaryland.net/ukraine/armed-forces/1st-special-purpose-brigade/  and artillery, and is fully mechanized. The Special Presidential Brigade took more digging, but the individual battalions are referred to as mechanized in their own literature. \n https://www.facebook.com/Prezydentska.Bryhada\n(Digression: The Special Presidential is an interesting rabbit hole to go down- It has 6 infantry battalions (though the Guards battalion may be detached) A full special forces battalion, but may not have armor- can't confirm or deny.  Here's a video I haven't seen elsewhere of them from the Vuhledar trenches https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJCW6qw0NI8)\n\nThe only exceptions I have to the heavy infantry commonality is the 142nd Rifle Brigade, which is new formed, so I lack info, but their unique name implies a difference of some kind, and of course the individual separate battalions may not be fully mechanized. The total number of individual battalions varies as units are added and removed from the list - Militaryland's list currently stands at 23 but  needs updating as several of the listed are components of the new brigades; still, many are still out there, seeing the elephant and soaking up all that veteran experience. The 6th,7th and 50th Independent battalions are currently fighting in or around Bakmut.\n\nAs for new unit formation, I have confirmation that the 78th AAB has joined the airborne corps, as it now has a page at Militaryland and a puff piece on the 82nd airborne references that the AAF has grown to ten brigades https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2023/05/03/ukraines-82nd-air-assault-brigade-is-ridiculously-powerful-and-could-lead-the-coming-counteroffensive/\n\n(Digression: The puff piece is an interesting read, though somewhat breathless in its adoration of the 82nd. It makes some claims about being the toughest brigade in the land, when all the AABs, even this one, are small and underequipped when compared to the veteran Mech Brigades. The article does have what I suspect is a typo, stating that the brigade has 2000 troops, which would be surprisingly small , particularly for a 4 infantry battalion brigade. I will seek clarification).\n\nI have seen some indication that two new mechanized brigades have been authorized, and commencing organization and training - The 42nd OMB and the 43rd OMB.  News so new I can't even confirm it.  \n\nFinally, a note on tank battalions. All the new brigades are authorized tank battalions, but I haven't confirmed such on several of the newer brigades as yet, though I have been able to confirm that the \"motorized\" brigades have them now. Tank battalion formation is its own little world, doled out by the Chernihiv Tank School, but they seem to have a steady supply. Most of the new battalions have a 'second hand rose' feel to them, a lot of patched together T-64s and T-72As- The tank brigades have quietly been re-outfitting this winter, as PT-91s, T-72M(improved) and T-72EAs have been delivered or enough captured T-80s are returned by the various 'Pimp my Ride' services now online in Eastern Nato countries.  But  even an old tank battalion is a tank battalion- The buffed up T-64s may lack the thermal optics, reactive armor and next gen electronics, but their role is to provide infantry support, and in that role, a tank is a tank is a tank.",

The total number of individual battalions varies as units are added and removed from the list - Militaryland&#39;s list currently stands at 23 but  needs updating as several of the listed are components of the new brigades; still, many are still out there, seeing the elephant and soaking up all that veteran experience. The 6th,7th and 50th Independent battalions are currently fighting in or around Bakmut.</p>\n\n<p>As for new unit formation, I have confirmation that the 78th AAB has joined the airborne corps, as it now has a page at Militaryland and a puff piece on the 82nd airborne references that the AAF has grown to ten brigades <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2023/05/03/ukraines-82nd-air-assault-brigade-is-ridiculously-powerful-and-could-lead-the-coming-counteroffensive/\">https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2023/05/03/ukraines-82nd-air-assault-brigade-is-ridiculously-powerful-and-could-lead-the-coming-counteroffensive/</a></p>\n\n<p>(Digression: The puff piece is an interesting read, though somewhat breathless in its adoration of the 82nd. It makes some claims about being the toughest brigade in the land, when all the AABs, even this one, are small and underequipped when compared to the veteran Mech Brigades. The article does have what I suspect is a typo, stating that the brigade has 2000 troops, which would be surprisingly small , particularly for a 4 infantry battalion brigade. I will seek clarification).</p>\n\n<p>I have seen some indication that two new mechanized brigades have been authorized, and commencing organization and training - The 42nd OMB and the 43rd OMB.  News so new I can&#39;t even confirm it.  </p>\n\n<p>Finally, a note on tank battalions. All the new brigades are authorized tank battalions, but I haven&#39;t confirmed such on several of the newer brigades as yet, though I have been able to confirm that the &quot;motorized&quot; brigades have them now. Tank battalion formation is its own little world, doled out by the Chernihiv Tank School, but they seem to have a steady supply. Most of the new battalions have a &#39;second hand rose&#39; feel to them, a lot of patched together T-64s and T-72As- The tank brigades have quietly been re-outfitting this winter, as PT-91s, T-72M(improved) and T-72EAs have been delivered or enough captured T-80s are returned by the various &#39;Pimp my Ride&#39; services now online in Eastern Nato countries.  But  even an old tank battalion is a tank battalion- The buffed up T-64s may lack the thermal optics, reactive armor and next gen electronics, but their role is to provide infantry support, and in that role, a tank is a tank is a tank.</p>\n</div>",

Under the plan, NT$23.65 billion (US$771.6 million) has been allotted over five years from 2022-2026 to produce and build various types of missiles, mobile missile launchers, and military facilities, Liberty Times reported.\n\n>The rate of progress for missile procurement is at 100%, with 800 total missiles produced in 2022, the MND said. Meanwhile, the rate of progress for mobile missile launcher procurement is at 95%...\n\n>The defense ministry expects 1000 missiles to be made domestically this year. NCSIST currently has 16 production lines for the mass production of various missiles, including the Chien Hsiang suicide drone, Wan Chien missile, Hsiung Sheng missile, Sky Bow III missile, ground-launched and ship-launched Sky Sword II missiles, extended range air-launched Sky Sword II missiles, as well as Hsiung Feng III and extended range Hsiung Feng III missiles.\n\n>On Wednesday, reports said delivery of Taiwan\u2019s newly purchased F-16V fighter jets would be postponed from the fourth quarter of 2023 until the third quarter of 2024. However, delivery of the 66 new jets would still be completed in 2026.\n\nI don't follow Taiwanese procurement particularly closely, but it seems their domestic military production is ramping up just fine following some new funding in recent years. ~1000 anti-air missiles per year is pretty solid, assuming their existing stockpiles are substantial.

That means \u201cthe risk of making a wrong decision will become much higher.\u201d  \n\n>Surging tensions over Taiwan have driven a spate of diplomacy across the Indo-Pacific by both Beijing and Washington. Xi\u2019s government accuses the US of building alliances to encircle China, while the US says Beijing\u2019s vast claims to the South China Sea and its military buildup aimed at Taiwan undermine security in the region.  \n\n>Working with other partners who have key intelligence to share is critical, Tsai said.\n\n>\u201cWe do share some information with our international friends,\u201d Tsai, who isn\u2019t related to Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, told Bloomberg before his presentation to lawmakers. \u201cThey also share information with us.

One of the big concerns is Ukraine not having the runways to support F-16 and Russia could missile strike anything that did get set up. Could Ukraine operate out of NATO airfields? The combat range of F-16 is 800km and the distance from Turkey to Crimea is only 300km, Romania to Kherson is 400km if you want to avoid the Russia navy in the black sea. We even know NATO flies sorties in international airspace like that for intel so they must have airbases in the area.\n\nWe know Russia has used Belarus airspace and airbases and we don't consider belarus to be at war with Ukraine. I realise that it would be better to have planes in Ukraine for quick scramble but that's not really an option for the F-16. Would it be too much to have NATO planes flying from NATO airbases with likely ex-NATO pilots?",

            "body": "I... doubt it could be done in a way that doesn't compromise NATO uninvolvement, even in theory.\n\nThe first concern would obviously be in terms of involvement, i.e. would that make NATO countries direct participants in the war. I'm not sure how international law works in this regard but I think it would push things past the limits of recent precedents.\n\nDuring the 1999 bombing campaign in Serbia, both Romania and Bulgaria, which were not NATO members and were not otherwise involved in operation Allied Force, allowed NATO to use their airspace for bombing missions. The FRY didn't claim that would make them cobelligerent and while it didn't exactly work wonders for their relations with their neighbours, it didn't irevocably wreck them, either. However, there's a long way from \"using airspace\" to \"using airfields\", and the FRY was not really in a position to do much, or to strain relations with its neighbors at the time.\n\nIn the early days of this war, a damaged Ukrainian Su-27 did cross the Romanian border, and the pilot asked for assistance. He landed safely and got shipped back to Ukraine but there's also a long way between landing an airplane damaged after a combat mission to using airfields to fly combat missions.\n\nBoth of these precedents are a long way from using airfields though. And precedent aside, there are two major complications.\n\nFirst, most nations have laws about stationing foreign troops on their territory. If it's a small military delegation, that's straightforward, but stationing large numbers of troops that conduct actual operations is a whole other story. Some exceptions are carved by NATO members for other NATO members, often through separate legislation, but usually it's not something that requires just inter-government and military cooperation, it needs parliamentary approval. While some countries in the region do have a wide political consensus on who to back (e.g. Poland, the Baltics, Romania to some degree), others don't (Bulgaria), and some of those that do (e.g. Hungary) don't have a consensus that would be particularly friendly to this. Even where a wide and favourable political consensus exists, it would be a risky move. So it would be hard to pull off such a thing both at a national level *and* at an international level (e.g. a NATO-wide decision would likely be blocked by some members).\n\nSecond, there's the problem of legitimacy of military targets. Operating an air base is a lot more than just getting planes up and down. In order for NATO countries to claim something resembling neutrality they'd have to pretty much lend their airfields to the Ukrainian military, remove any NATO military personnel from the airfields, keep them away from all supply chains and so on. That's probably impossible. More importantly, it wouldn't be very easy to argue that supply convoys heading for them, as well as the airfields themselves, aren't legitimate military targets (as far as anything is a legitimate military target in a war of aggression, in any case). Possibly legitimate non-NATO military targets on the territory of NATO countries would be extremely risky.\n\nSure, NATO operates intelligence flights out of Eastern flank countries, but they operate in NATO airspace or in international airspace (IIRC they aren't flying in Ukrainian airspace, or at least not openly?). Flying *combat* missions out of NATO airfields however would be a whole other story, and I'm not sure there's any way to do it without making NATO countries cobelligerents.",

(This is assuming that the US detected the troop movements months beforehand). So that\u2019s what - 6-8 carrier strike groups alone blockading China? They\u2019ll serve to blockade any trades and fuel coming in by ship to China. Draining their economy that\u2019s already tanked by hypothetical world sanctions in place. \n\nNow place the rest of the USN fleets (non-carriers) assisting in the blockade. The USN SSN submarines are levels apart from anything the Chinese and they would also play a huge part in it. \n\nThis is just the USN by the way. If the US really commits we\u2019re talking coalition forces consisting of the Japanese, Koreans, Australians, British, etc. that also have capable ships and aircrafts to combat the Chinese.\n\nNow.

If they land, there\u2019s probably no chance the Taiwanese actually can fight them off. Their army is considerably smaller and weaker than the PLA. The job therefore, for the USN and USAF is to prevent them from reaching the shore while defending their positions at sea and eliminating any PLAN or PLA aircrafts (doable but costly).\n\nAt the end of the day, it\u2019s all about how much the America wants this. The Chinese probably will end up sinking a carrier or two in a head to head. That\u2019s couple thousand lives there alone and billions of dollars - is that worth it? Maybe.\n\nI\u2019m not even gonna mention what a ground war in Taiwan would look like if the US decided to get boots on the ground and deployed the Marines.
