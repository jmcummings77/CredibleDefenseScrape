It&#39;s hard to overstate the significance of this petition for Ukraine since it&#39;s the only bill supported by Democratic leadership and thus likely the only hope for Ukraine aid.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://clerk.house.gov/DischargePetition/2024031209?CongressNum=118\">https://clerk.house.gov/DischargePetition/2024031209?CongressNum=118</a></p>\n\n<p>This article estimates a &quot;dozen or more&quot; Republican signatures will be needed:</p>\n\n<p>THE DISCHARGE CHARGE: The discharge petition that would force the Senate\u2019s foreign aid bill will officially start collecting signatures of House members today \u2014 a big moment for backers of Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, though the fate of the bill is uncertain. With some progressive Democrats likely to oppose the bill, the discharge petition would have to rustle up probably a dozen Republicans or more. House Minority Leader HAKEEM JEFFRIES today told his caucus they should sign on today before leaving town, per WaPo\u2019s Leigh Ann Caldwell.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook-pm/2024/03/12/no-ones-with-hur-00132333?nname=playbook-pm&amp;nid=0000015a-dd3e-d536-a37b-dd7fd8af0000&amp;nrid=0000014e-f0ed-dd93-ad7f-f8edad790000&amp;nlid=964328\">https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook-pm/2024/03/12/no-ones-with-hur-00132333?nname=playbook-pm&amp;nid=0000015a-dd3e-d536-a37b-dd7fd8af0000&amp;nrid=0000014e-f0ed-dd93-ad7f-f8edad790000&amp;nlid=964328</a></p>\n</div>",

            "body": "The fundamental mistake Biden is making right now is that he is making the issue of Rafah a public fight of the wills between him and Netanyahu.\n\nObama did the same thing and it ended with Netanyahu holding a speech in front of congress (and ruling for another 8 years). \n\nSo now Biden is in a position where he has defined a red line but also dared Netanyahu to cross the line. At the same time there is universal support to \"finish the operation\" in Israel. Gantz, Netanyahus biggest opponent, is on board with the operation and so is Gallant. This gives Netanyahu all the power to deploy the: \"Biden is against Israel!\" talking point, which he is doing. It could also force the opposition to adopt a harsher rhetoric because they don't want to look like Bidens useful pawns. \n\nI also have a problem with the idea that Israel needs to stop or will stop the Gaza campaign if the US tries to play hardball. If it's on the horizon that for the next 4 (Biden) years or even longer the US support for Israel will be limited then that's a reason to invade Rafah and finish off Hamas in Gaza, not to withdraw and allow it to rebuild.

At the same time there is universal support to &quot;finish the operation&quot; in Israel. Gantz, Netanyahus biggest opponent, is on board with the operation and so is Gallant. This gives Netanyahu all the power to deploy the: &quot;Biden is against Israel!&quot; talking point, which he is doing.

Israel warned that it was a bad thing because extreme Islamist regimes would handily win the elections and that is exactly what happened. Egypt flipped from an Israeli ally to a hostile state overnight and thus Obama had to backpedal and support al-Sisi tossing Morsi out. Of course a coup d'\u00e9tat is never a clean thing.

I think that&#39;s dumb, personally, but it also speaks to the power that they think they have, that they believe they can just deal with it if the US is hostile to them whenever Democrats are in power. Maybe they&#39;re wrong about that but I think it also speaks to the fact that they aren&#39;t as weak or reliant on the US as a lot of people here seem to believe.</p>\n</div>",

Not just lobbying but also perception management. In the past, Israel's public relations campaigns were extremely successful at influencing older Americans into thinking of it as a modern, secular Democracy that was generally the good guy compared to their neighbors. \n\nThose attitudes stuck with older people. In 2022 69% of Americans 65 and older still had positive views of Israel. However, that was already trending downward significantly among younger people who had been exposed to a different view of Israel. By the time you get to the 18-29 year old age group it was already 56% *unfavorable* towards Israel in 2022.\n\nThere are probably multiple reasons for this but one obvious reason is that Israel's government has been drifting \"right\" for a long time and publicly engaging in certain behaviors that aren't considered acceptable by the moral standards of a modern progressive liberal democracy. However, until recently this wasn't widely broadcast outside of academia and certain left wing publications.\n\nAt first, Israel had a lot of sympathy after the attack on October 7th. However, that sympathy was undermined as Netanyahu responded in a way that needlessly and publicly killed thousands of civilians. Because of the way this war was conducted, it ended up causing great harm to Israel's public image, even though they started out as the victim!\n\nThis suits Netanyahu and the Israeli far right just fine and it could lead to a long term transformation of Israeli society in a way that is favorable to them.\n\nBut Israel's long term security is still dependent on other countries and it may find that the previous approach was more effective than the current approach. In the past, Israeli had overwhelming bipartisan support and criticism was largely off limits. There was very little public scrutiny of anything questionable that Israel might need to do to protect itself.\n\nNow that Netanyahu is taking the mask off, attitudes are going to be less overwhelmingly positive, criticism of Israel's behavior is going to be more present in society and there will be more scrutiny on what is being done with the aid they receive. That won't necessarily lead to negative security consequences like a loss of aid immediately, but over time it might.\n\nBiden probably can't stop Netanyahu, but he's correct to publicly distance himself from Netanyahu and warn that the consequences of this war will be overall negative for Israel's security, because they failed to behave in a responsible way towards civilians.",

They also lost a tank in mint condition by driving over a mine. If my memory serves me right, it was the first time they committed  tanks to a border raid.</p>\n</div>",
