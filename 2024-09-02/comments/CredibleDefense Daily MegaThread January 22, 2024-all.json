        "body": "A large Ukrainian Telegram channel wrote about the reason, according to their informations, for the Russian breakthrough in the area of the former restaurant \"Tsarska Ohota\". Basically, in the area just south of the Avdiivka-Yasynuvata railway (near the Skotovata ditch), the Russians allegedly discovered a \"pipe\" (I guess a sewer pipe?), wide 80 centimeters in diameter and over 2 kilometers long, which comes out at the beginning of the private sector near Soborna Street. 150 Russian assault troops reportedly passed through this pipe and popped up near the houses on Soborna, Sportyvna and Chernyshevskoho Streets, infiltrated into them and surprised the Ukrainian positions in Tsarska Ohota from behind. While this sounds like something at the peak of the non-credibility, it may indeed explain the fall of Tsarska Ohota, towards which there had been zero progress since October despite constant attacks, with the Russians, at the end of that month, even having to retreat from the flyover over the railroad they had occupied in the very first days of the offensive. \n\nhttps://t. me/operatyvnii/17683\n\nAt the moment it looks like not only have the Russians captured the former restaurant, but they are also in the houses along the three streets listed above. The situation is fluid and the Ukrainians could have counterattacked - I think only from the next days we will know what the situation is like in the southern part of the city. The Russian units involved seem to be the Assault and Reconnaissance Brigade \"Veterans\", former PMC made up of skilled people compared to the average: they are the same perpetrators of the breakthrough of Ukrainian positions in the industrial zone (known as \"Promka\") in November, and where as well there had been an instance of a tunnel (another sewer pipe?) - which they had filled with explosives and detonated in the point below the Ukrainian positions. They are supported by elements of the 55th Mountain Brigade of the 41st Army and of the 1st Motorized Brigade of the 1st Corps, as well as the BARS-11 detachment, which according to Ukrainian sources became a battalion of the Assault and Reconnaissance Brigade \"Convoy\", another former PMC. \n\nOnce the positions were occupied, the Russians also sent mechanized reinforcements through the road which passes just to the side of Tsarska Ohota and that then becomes Soborna Street, in the direction of the city's private sector, but it appears that the Ukrainians were able to neutralize the column: the Russians lost three tanks and two BMP-2s there. In contrast, the area between the former restaurant and the small quarry west of the vineyard should still be controlled by the Ukrainians. The units active in the southern part of the city should be, as far as I know, the 1st and 2nd Mechanized Battalions of the 110th Mechanized Brigade, the 6th Separate Rifle Battalion and the \"Kyiv\" Police Regiment.\n\nRumors swirled this afternoon about the fall of the former anti-aircraft missile regiment base, known as \"Zenith\", north-west of Spartak and beyond the unfinished Donetsk ring road. The evidence would be a video depicting stormtroopers from the 80th Tank Regiment of the 90th Tank Division (41st Army, CMD) with a handful of Ukrainian POWs from the Separate Presidential Brigade. Russian sources have geolocated it in the area of the former base, but as far as I have seen, the geolocation is... a bit dubious. We'll see. This is the first time, as far as I know, that this regiment is mentioned as being present in Avdiivka - it would be the second regiment of the division deployed in the sector, after the 239th Tank Regiment active in the north-east flank of Avdiivka. At the moment we have no indications to confirm or deny the fall of Zenith. The problem is that the viability of supplies to Ukrainian positions in that area has deteriorated considerably with the loss of Tsarska Ohota and particularly of the forested area west of it. There is no news about \"Cheburashka\" (i.e. the junction between T-05-05 Road and the ring road), another Ukrainian stronghold, just north-east of the former military base.\n\nIn recent days there has also been activity in the \"Promka\" area. The \"Pyatnashka\" Battalion (an \"elite\" unit of the 1st Corps), with support from elements of the 10th Tank Regiment of the 6th Motorized Division of the 3rd Corps and the 87th Motorized Regiment of the 1st Corps, has been assaulting the Ukrainian trenches in the forested area north-west of the intersection of Yasynovskyi Lane with the H20 Road. These positions are instrumental in defending both the Donetsk Filtration Station and the high ground still in Ukrainian hands to the south-east of the Kamianka creek's valley. The attack appears to have been largely unsuccessful, and the deputy commander of \"Pyatnashka\" Battalion fell in action.",

        "body": "Tensions between at least 25 of the E.U.'s 27 member states and Hungary, continue to escalate. Excerpts:\n\n>[EU Ready to Play Hardball With Hungary Over Blocked Ukraine Aid](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-22/hungary-opposes-revamping-eu-fund-for-ukraine-weapons-deliveries?srnd=politics-vp)\n\n>* Budapest opposes revamping EU fund for Ukraine weapons aid\n>* Rest of the EU could push ahead and toughen stance on Hungary\n\n>European Union leaders are ready to play hardball with Hungary if Prime Minister Viktor Orban should continue to block a \u20ac50 billion ($54.5 billion) support package for Ukraine at an extraordinary summit next week, people familiar with the preparations said.\n\n>Hungary on Monday opposed a bid within the bloc to create a new fund to ensure a more reliable way of delivering crucial military aid to Ukraine. The move comes after Orban torpedoed a joint European decision on the four-year financial package for Ukraine in mid-December.\n\n>Member states are poised to pass the Ukraine package at the Brussels summit on Feb. 1 regardless of Hungary\u2019s backing, said the people, speaking on condition of anonymity because the discussions are private.\n\n>If Orban continues to block the support package, there will be a decision of the remaining EU 26 to pass it and preparations for such a scenario are well advanced, the officials added.\n\n>A potential back-up option that has been floated is having the remaining member states funnel money to Kyiv outside of the EU budget process. The proposal would involve national guarantees to raise funding in the markets if Hungary continued to bloc a joint decision.\n\n>Should Orban decide to go down this road, an escalation is possible \u2014 including the EU launching the next stage of penalty measures against Budapest that could lead to the withdrawal of its voting rights as a member state, the officials said.\n\n>Szijjarto said the issue will be discussed when he meets his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba on Jan. 29. Budapest will consider lifting its blockage if Ukraine offers \u201cguarantees\u201d that Hungarian companies won\u2019t be added to its list of international war sponsors.\n\nIt's difficult to believe that a facility that would help to subsidize arms production across Europe at a time when it's desperately needed, and stimulate economic expansion, would be vetoed on the grounds that Szijjarto claims. It's much more likely that Hungary will continue playing hardball until it can render more concessions out of the EU on completely unrelated issues.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Tensions between at least 25 of the E.U.&#39;s 27 member states and Hungary, continue to escalate. Excerpts:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-22/hungary-opposes-revamping-eu-fund-for-ukraine-weapons-deliveries?srnd=politics-vp\">EU Ready to Play Hardball With Hungary Over Blocked Ukraine Aid</a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Budapest opposes revamping EU fund for Ukraine weapons aid</li>\n<li>Rest of the EU could push ahead and toughen stance on Hungary</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>European Union leaders are ready to play hardball with Hungary if Prime Minister Viktor Orban should continue to block a \u20ac50 billion ($54.5 billion) support package for Ukraine at an extraordinary summit next week, people familiar with the preparations said.</p>\n\n<p>Hungary on Monday opposed a bid within the bloc to create a new fund to ensure a more reliable way of delivering crucial military aid to Ukraine. The move comes after Orban torpedoed a joint European decision on the four-year financial package for Ukraine in mid-December.</p>\n\n<p>Member states are poised to pass the Ukraine package at the Brussels summit on Feb. 1 regardless of Hungary\u2019s backing, said the people, speaking on condition of anonymity because the discussions are private.</p>\n\n<p>If Orban continues to block the support package, there will be a decision of the remaining EU 26 to pass it and preparations for such a scenario are well advanced, the officials added.</p>\n\n<p>A potential back-up option that has been floated is having the remaining member states funnel money to Kyiv outside of the EU budget process. The proposal would involve national guarantees to raise funding in the markets if Hungary continued to bloc a joint decision.</p>\n\n<p>Should Orban decide to go down this road, an escalation is possible \u2014 including the EU launching the next stage of penalty measures against Budapest that could lead to the withdrawal of its voting rights as a member state, the officials said.</p>\n\n<p>Szijjarto said the issue will be discussed when he meets his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba on Jan. 29. Budapest will consider lifting its blockage if Ukraine offers \u201cguarantees\u201d that Hungarian companies won\u2019t be added to its list of international war sponsors.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It&#39;s difficult to believe that a facility that would help to subsidize arms production across Europe at a time when it&#39;s desperately needed, and stimulate economic expansion, would be vetoed on the grounds that Szijjarto claims. It&#39;s much more likely that Hungary will continue playing hardball until it can render more concessions out of the EU on completely unrelated issues. Sweden&#39;s accession to NATO, unfortunately, could also become a victim of that ploy, though without Erdogan running interference and providing political cover, Orban could at least fold on that issue. </p>\n\n<p>Elsewhere, there are mild signs of <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-22/germany-and-france-point-fingers-over-ukraine-weapons-deliveries?srnd=politics-vp\">discord</a> about who is carrying their weight in supplying Ukraine with military aid.

You have to provide detection and guidance for the interceptor drone.  \n\nThe technology of choice today would be radar, which can be made of solid state components and thus durable.  But then you run into aperture size problem.  For higher detection range (or sensitivity) and positional accuracy, you need large physical size for your radar.  This means a large drone.  Let's say, you separate detection function into a large spotter drone, which which means interceptor drone doesn't have to carry a large aperture radar.\n\nFor guidance, you will have to either go radar or optical imaging, since drones typically do not generate much heat so IR does not work.  In radar guidance, you either need to put a small radar onto the interceptor or just detector on the interceptor with illumination coming from the spotter drone.  \n\nIn optical guidance, you'd have to be able to spot the target in video image once interceptor drone arrives at location provided by spotter drone.  This means the target coordinate generated by spotter drone's radar has to be accurate enough  that the target image can be acquired in interceptor's video camera.  My hunch is that you will need both radar and optical guidance, given drones are pretty small and hard to spot.\n\nSo, to sum up, you need the following:\n- Spotter drone (few) with a large aperture radar that can run both scan and track capability\n- Interceptor drone (numerous) with radar detector and video camera for terminal guidance\n- Spotter and interceptor need secure data communication for attack coordination and telemetry\n- Both spotter and interceptor need endurance for loitering\n\nThere are some new components that need R&D:\n- Radar system for detection/illumination\n- Guidance system that integrates radar detector and video camera\n- Control software for spotter and interceptor\n\nFor radar system and guidance system, you're looking at developing/designing some logic chips, mixed logic/analog chips, RF chips, integrated system testing, etc.  Some firmware need to be written for systems.  Lots of software needed to program spotter/interceptor team behaviors.  Building flight hardware could probably be done with just off-the-shelf components.\n\nMy rough estimate for R&D is probably 200-300 million dollars over 3-4 years with access to multiple chip foundries, with talents ranging from chip processing to integrated software stack development.  I'm not sure if Ukraine can do this.\n\nEDIT: after posting, I was scratching my head if this could be done by hacking together existing components.  (Like, somehow networking commercial WiFi transceiver chips to build phased array radar). I cannot say it cannot be done, so if I were in charge of R&D program, I may budget few million dollars to fund start-ups to see there is a path in parallel to the main R&D program.",

I'd reckon that they'd keep launch numbers low to preserve the threat they face rather than try to launch a ton in a strike that'd probably still result in light damage. \n\nTBMs are a far bigger interception problem for commercial traffic defense than cruise missiles or UAVs since they can only be intercepted in a relatively small radius around the defending ship, which would necessitate dedicated escorts firing SM-3s or SM-6s. UAV/ASHMs can be intercepted anywhere from the launch site to the target vessel by systems like a fighter's AIM-9s and AIM-120, a ships' SM-2/SM-6s, ESSM, RIM-116 RAM, ship's cannons, CIWS, and even a MANPAD launched from the deck of a cargo ship. They also fly slower and are easier to organize an interception for, especially with the airborne observation by E-2Ds and fighters removing most of the benefit from sea-skimming. \n\nMy prediction was wrong and a one-way UAS did hit a cargo ship after the start of air operations, though. I wonder how that happened. Yemeni airspace is not open and they could organize air defense efforts to disrupt aviation operations over the coast. It could have been fired in a roundabout way over Saudi, other airspace, or from another vessel. Or it was just plain missed by aerial patrols! \n\nhttps://www.centcom.mil/MEDIA/PRESS-RELEASES/Press-Release-View/Article/3648157/houthis-attack-us-owned-and-operated-bulk-carrier/",

        "body": "An interesting interview with a Russian gunner who has been serving since the first day of the war. Plenty of personal observations and combat experiences, but I will just quote excerpts that have to do with their pre-war training and improvements in doctrine.\n\nIn short - the training prepared the artillery battalion for extremely dense deployment and driving in tight columns. The communication was done through field phones (model 1957), wire and a few radios. In the first months of the war fires were opened blind, at geographic coordinates, with no observation. They expended 300-400 shells per day.\n\nAfter two years of war, they have switched to deploying their guns over areas measuring kilometres, with solid communications (thanks to donations). The fire direction centre has dozens of UAV live feeds. The shell expenditure has dropped to several dozen per day, but they can observe the impact they have.\n\n[https://telegra](https://telegra). ph/Intervyu-uchastnika-SVO-1-CHast-01-20\n\n[https://telegra](https://telegra). ph/Intervyu-uchastnika-SVO-2-CHast-01-22\n\n...\n\n>I will briefly tell you the specifics of the division's combat work BEFORE the war. All live-fire exercises usually took place the same way from year to year. Same. We go to the fields for a couple of months, where we put up tents, go to fire training, do random bullshit (water-firewood-shit)... The exercises themselves take 3-4 days out of all this. Reconnaissance officers drive to the control point, from where they spot targets and adjust our shooting where we are hitting... Usually this is a huge field and 5-7 km from the control point, the targets are mounds and sometimes we put together two -by-two shields... We are still there 3 km from the checkpoint with guns.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>An interesting interview with a Russian gunner who has been serving since the first day of the war. Plenty of personal observations and combat experiences, but I will just quote excerpts that have to do with their pre-war training and improvements in doctrine.</p>\n\n<p>In short - the training prepared the artillery battalion for extremely dense deployment and driving in tight columns. The communication was done through field phones (model 1957), wire and a few radios. In the first months of the war fires were opened blind, at geographic coordinates, with no observation. They expended 300-400 shells per day.</p>\n\n<p>After two years of war, they have switched to deploying their guns over areas measuring kilometres, with solid communications (thanks to donations). The fire direction centre has dozens of UAV live feeds. The shell expenditure has dropped to several dozen per day, but they can observe the impact they have.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://telegra\">https://telegra</a>. ph/Intervyu-uchastnika-SVO-1-CHast-01-20</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://telegra\">https://telegra</a>. ph/Intervyu-uchastnika-SVO-2-CHast-01-22</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I will briefly tell you the specifics of the division&#39;s combat work BEFORE the war. All live-fire exercises usually took place the same way from year to year. Same. We go to the fields for a couple of months, where we put up tents, go to fire training, do random bullshit (water-firewood-shit)... The exercises themselves take 3-4 days out of all this. Reconnaissance officers drive to the control point, from where they spot targets and adjust our shooting where we are hitting... Usually this is a huge field and 5-7 km from the control point, the targets are mounds and sometimes we put together two -by-two shields... We are still there 3 km from the checkpoint with guns. I receive targets from reconnaissance by radio, the coordinates are calculated, the firing settings are transmitted via wire (as it was determined by someone that guns are always connected only via wire) to the guns, they are already aimed and firing... Everything is like during the Second World War. The only difference is that the radio stations are newer and reconnaissance also has something in addition to binoculars...
