Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

And the USA knew this, which is why oil was initially excluded from the Export Control Act.\n\nAdditionally, the USA never actually explicitly banned Japan from purchasing oil. On 26 July 1941, the Roosevelt administration froze all Japanese assets in the USA, which stopped them from buying oil or doing anything else with those assets.

On 26 July 1941, the Roosevelt administration froze all Japanese assets in the USA, which stopped them from buying oil or doing anything else with those assets.

Though gradually the communist elements take over the alliance and it becomes communist party of Vietnam. The name, Vietminh, is short for Vietnam Doc Lap Dong Minh Hoi aka The Alliance for the Independence of Vietnam.\n\n\nBefore becoming an alliance they already acted as nationalists groups formed by Vietnamese intellectuals that oppose French indochina administration, but they were clamped down hard by French intelligence agencies, the S\u00fbret\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9ral indochinoise. But when France mainland quickly lost to Germany in Europe and Indochina occupied by Imperial Japan, HCM unified these groups, exploiting the advantages of the chaotic situation and apply communist insurgency doctrine to expand the support base for Vietminh. They still lay low during WW2 but applied various methods, for example: infiltrate mines, factories and teaching the workers about the ideology, go to countryside to convince to peasants to rise up against the elites, forming secret societies in the cities. It was very effective since the nature of Vietnam society at the time: the French administrate the cities but in the countryside they still keep the old imperial government bureaucrats, only care about taxes quota. So these local governments officials and village elites freely oppress and exploit the lowly peasants to rich themselves. While in the cities there are educated city folks who see the unfair treatment of the colonial administration and want independence. They getting more sympathizers because the French administration increased taxes to support the mainland during WW1 and after, then got worse when the Japanese came, more aggressively exploit the resources to support their war effort. The Vietminh formed centralized and local military groups, like the National salvation front or Vanguard youth, teaching people, especially in countryside where 98% are illiterate, forcibly take land from landlords to distribute to peasants, abolished corvee( mandatory labor taxes by old Vietnamese imperial court upon able bodied males every years to build the emperor second wife' uncle palace or something). These activities are widely supported by the majority of population, baring the minority elite class that their land and property is taken away. That's not to mention the Vietminh during the WW2 opposed the imperial Japanese force so they get support from Allies forces like Americans OSS giving weapons and intelligence in exchange Vietminh carry out assassination, sabotage Japan war efforts and rescue Americans pilots \n\n\nSo you can see before the WW2 Vietminh was in the first phase, it evolved into the second phase during the WW2. By the time near the end of WW2, the aggressive exploitation of imperial Japanese leading to mass starvation, resulted 1,5-2 millions death in the north Vietnam. After Japan surrendered to the Allies, Vietminh seize the chance, rallying the starving population and launch a revolt country wide to take the rice storage then take  over the government from the low morale Japanese occupation forces.

And \"resort\" is the right word there, because any force strong enough to fight conventionally will avoid insurgency at all costs, because it surrenders the population to brutal occupation and reprisals. The fact that Ukraine is fighting a conventional war puts them in a *better* position against Russia than Afghans were against the US, and it's bizarre that you're acting like there's nothing we can learn in that comparison. If the Ukrainian army collapses tomorrow, *Russia will still have to win a counter insurgency campaign*.\n\nThe reason people have struggled to come up with a perfect answer for your hypothetical is because you've set your boundaries ridiculously narrow. \"Name a time that a small country won a war against a significantly stronger country, but didn't resort to insurgency, and did it without winning too quickly\" is a lot of conditions, and it's even narrower if you want to restrict yourself to the modern era (since, in theory, you want this to be applicable to a modern war). I actually might have a decent answer (the continental portion of the Seven Years War, from Prussia's perspective), but does that, ya know, tell us anything? I'm not really thinking so, since industrial production has changed a lot since the 1700s (though I guess Russia's leader unexpectedly dying and the diplomatic scene suddenly changing radically might be relevant).\n\nIt's fairly rich for you to lecture others for not knowing anything without war, when you don't seem to recognize the most basic fact about it - wars are contests of wills, not contests of who can make the most shells. The US didn't lose Vietnam because they were beaten on the battlefield, they lost because they decided (probably later than they should have) that nothing they could win on the battlefield was worth what it cost. They *could have kept fighting*, but they *didn't*, even though they had the money and industrial base to keep going. If the US population and US policy makers had been convinced that winning in Vietnam was critical to the survival of America, they would have decided differently! The fight in Ukraine hinges on the same thing - how far will Moscow go before it decides that nothing they can win in Ukraine is worth the cost? From a purely rational perspective, we're already far, far beyond that point, so the conclusion of this war is clearly determined by fundamentally irrational factors. Unfortunately, that makes it hard to predict accurately! But that cuts both ways - fundamentally, no one knows how long this war will last for, who will win, or what winning might look like.

At this point I can&#39;t help feeling that it&#39;s indeed valuable to assume that the Russians, both the people and the state, are driven primary by ideology and to consider what that ideology is and how it can help predict their actions. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>anyone&#39;s who promotes the idea of NATO expansion being a big issue</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The big issue is not the expansion of NATO, but the existence of NATO. The Russians believe they are not safe as long as NATO, and by extension the entire &quot;West&quot; exists.</p>\n</div>",

What that response is is up for debate, but the point is that Russia has deterred NATO from intervening to date, and a dumb excuse to intervene does not change the equation, Russia will not say \"ah, we can't actually retaliate they have a justified reason to invade Ukraine and take it themselves\". So the perceived deterrence from Russia will remain in place.\n\nConversely, if Ukraine decides to declare war on Poland without telling anyone first, NATO won't just go \"haha article 5\" and invade, as article 5 is not an insta-declare-war mechanism. If a country decided they wanted to invoke it, this would be discussed in the North Atlantic Council, where they would also decide on the measures to take. Another important consideration is that Article 5 is very slightly ambiguous to leave the door open to assisting the attacked party by means other than armed force:\n\n> \u201cThe Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognized by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, **including the use of armed force**, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area. \n\nThis essentially means that through Article 5, a proportional response will be given. A large scale military invasion will be met by the military forces of all of NATO, but a small incident, or a simple war declaration will not. It's the same reason that a Russian missile veering off course and landing in Poland cannot realistically be used to trigger Article 5 and start a war against Russia.\n\n[NATO's website explains article 5 pretty well](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_110496.htm), I recommend giving it a read.",
