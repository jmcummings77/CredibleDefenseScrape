I mean Russian one is dumb too but I can see how dumb people would buy into it, Chinese one is instead cartoon villain type silliness.\n\nI was watching a video about upcoming Chinese shuttle, which isn\u2019t scheduled to fly until sometime in 2030s but the presenter was talking like it\u2019s already happening (shit you not they were playing KSP videos as demonstration). They were talking about how advanced it is and how it is much better than American Space Shuttle, and of course the most famous ones being Chllenger and Columbia which blew up! Just absolutely casually throwing it in there. And then she went on like 4 minute segment talking about how the space shuttle could be also used as a vehicle to drop nuclear bombs on America and how America will have no defense against it because it will be maneuvering at hypersonic speeds!

I mean Russian one is dumb too but I can see how dumb people would buy into it, Chinese one is instead cartoon villain type silliness.</p>\n\n<p>I was watching a video about upcoming Chinese shuttle, which isn\u2019t scheduled to fly until sometime in 2030s but the presenter was talking like it\u2019s already happening (shit you not they were playing KSP videos as demonstration). They were talking about how advanced it is and how it is much better than American Space Shuttle, and of course the most famous ones being Chllenger and Columbia which blew up! Just absolutely casually throwing it in there. And then she went on like 4 minute segment talking about how the space shuttle could be also used as a vehicle to drop nuclear bombs on America and how America will have no defense against it because it will be maneuvering at hypersonic speeds!

However, Poland failed to conclude long-term gas contracts with Norway for gas supply through the pipeline, with Polish PM Morawiecki at one point saying the prices Norway was asking for were too high, and due to technical difficulties the beginning of exploitation of the Tyra 2 gas field will be delayed from Autumn 2022 until the start of 2023. According to analysts from the largest Polish bank PKO BP, Poland is facing a supply gap of 5.6 billion cubic meters this winter (according to [data](https://www.statista.com/statistics/703670/natural-gas-consumption-poland/) from Statista this represents a little under a quarter of Poland\u2019s total yearly gas consumption).

Each line should be held by units staged in depth using the classic \"two up, one back\" set up. There were supposedly up to three defensive lines built outside of Kherson, each based on specific terrain features, natural obstacles, mine fields, assembled fixed fortifications (including reinforced concrete bunkers), etc. \n\nEither the Russians have the manning (extra reinforcements sent weeks ago) to defend in depth and have different units already in reserve manning those other lines, or else they'll require the same units holding the first line to fall back intact to man subsequent lines. If that's the case they definitely can't allow themselves to become decisively engaged; basically, the defenders can fire a quick and violent volley at UAF attackers, call in arty to cover their retreat, and then pull back to their next position. But if they do have the strength, then the leading Russian defenders can be sacrificial to some extent and can seriously contest the ground they're defending before they fall back. Though that assumes the Russians are able or willing to follow their own doctrine. \n\nWhat likely happened yesterday was the UAF launched numerous combined arms battalion sized attacks using PGMs against the Russian outposts and maybe also the first line defenses.\n\nThat said, to fully breach a defensive line isn't just a matter of blowing shit up with HIMARS and 155mm arty then driving APCs and tanks through the gap. It means a legit breach, specifically dealing with large mine fields, which take time to clear pathways through them, especially without dedicated engineering vehicles and skilled combat engineers. While the UAF are doing that, fires need to be conducted in depth against known second line defenses, while UAF attackers set up a hasty defense to beat back any Russian counterattacks, all while doing resupply, rest plan, prepping for subsequent operations, possible passage of lines of a second echelon force dedicated to the second line of Russian defenses.",

In recent weeks, Ukraine has also been using US-supplied Himars precision rocket systems to target makeshift Russian pontoon bridges, as well as command posts and ammunition depots.\n\n>This is widely seen as part of a targeted effort to cut off Russian troops on the right (western) bank of the river, making it virtually impossible to send troops and weapons resupplies.\n\n>However, **officials in Kyiv have been cautioning against any expectations of a quick win**, describing the offensive as a slow grinding down of the enemy.\n\n>Several military experts interviewed by the BBC seem to agree with this.\n\n>**\"The long-term trend is the gradual weakening of the Russian military capability and the gradual strengthening of the Ukrainian capability with Western help,\"** said Sir Alex Younger, a former head of Britain's MI6 Secret Intelligence Service.\n\n>He said the Kherson counter-offensive was \"all about the urge of Ukraine to demonstrate they can get on the front foot and in turn underpin the resolve of Ukraine and its backers into what is going to be a difficult winter\".\n\n>Justin Bronk, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) defence think tank, told the BBC he believed Ukraine would continue with strikes using Himars as they were proving so successful at cutting off Russian supply lines.\n\n>Moving forward, though, Mr Bronk said he expected to see more of an \"attritional strategy\" by Ukraine, \"pushing [Russia] on a broad front, trying to force Russian morale to break and inflict casualties\".\n\n>Meanwhile, Ukrainian military expert Mykhaylo Zhyrokhov told the BBC: **\"We shouldn't be expecting a cavalry attack, because the general staff of Ukraine's armed forces doesn't want street fighting [in the Kherson city] - that would result in heavy casualties.\"**\n\n>\"The Ukrainian strategy is to squeeze the enemy out,\" he said, warning that this \"won't happen quickly\".\n\n>**\"It's like a situation with a cornered rat that needs to be offered a way out.

In recent weeks, Ukraine has also been using US-supplied Himars precision rocket systems to target makeshift Russian pontoon bridges, as well as command posts and ammunition depots.</p>\n\n<p>This is widely seen as part of a targeted effort to cut off Russian troops on the right (western) bank of the river, making it virtually impossible to send troops and weapons resupplies.</p>\n\n<p>However, <strong>officials in Kyiv have been cautioning against any expectations of a quick win</strong>, describing the offensive as a slow grinding down of the enemy.</p>\n\n<p>Several military experts interviewed by the BBC seem to agree with this.</p>\n\n<p><strong>&quot;The long-term trend is the gradual weakening of the Russian military capability and the gradual strengthening of the Ukrainian capability with Western help,&quot;</strong> said Sir Alex Younger, a former head of Britain&#39;s MI6 Secret Intelligence Service.</p>\n\n<p>He said the Kherson counter-offensive was &quot;all about the urge of Ukraine to demonstrate they can get on the front foot and in turn underpin the resolve of Ukraine and its backers into what is going to be a difficult winter&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Justin Bronk, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) defence think tank, told the BBC he believed Ukraine would continue with strikes using Himars as they were proving so successful at cutting off Russian supply lines.</p>\n\n<p>Moving forward, though, Mr Bronk said he expected to see more of an &quot;attritional strategy&quot; by Ukraine, &quot;pushing [Russia] on a broad front, trying to force Russian morale to break and inflict casualties&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Ukrainian military expert Mykhaylo Zhyrokhov told the BBC: <strong>&quot;We shouldn&#39;t be expecting a cavalry attack, because the general staff of Ukraine&#39;s armed forces doesn&#39;t want street fighting [in the Kherson city] - that would result in heavy casualties.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&quot;The Ukrainian strategy is to squeeze the enemy out,&quot; he said, warning that this &quot;won&#39;t happen quickly&quot;.</p>\n\n<p><strong>&quot;It&#39;s like a situation with a cornered rat that needs to be offered a way out. Ukraine&#39;s military should aim to provide the Russian troops with such a withdrawal route, otherwise [the Russians troops] would be fighting until the last soldier.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>&quot;The window of opportunity is until mid-October because after that the mainly field roads in the region will become impassable&quot;</strong> because of mud and slush, Mr Zhyrokhov said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

I've been eagerly observing this conflict even before the war since the 2014 annexation and especially during the tense weeks leading up to the current active war, as far back as late January, I don't recall a single account by any source that actually managed to capture the reality of what later turned into the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nI don't think there was much focus on Putin's plans beyond the discussions about whether he will annex and integrate Ukraine or simply replace the leadership and leave a Belarus style puppet, they simply didn't matter much when so many were expecting Kyiv, shortly followed by the rest of the country, to [fall to Russia](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-24/western-allies-see-kyiv-falling-to-russian-forces-within-hours) sooner rather than later.\n\nIt was all speculation to begin with, but it's rather recent and after-the-fact type of speculation to top it off as well, as Putin's plans only really became important once it has become clear that Phase One (a term coined by Russia, possibly to separate the disasterous opening months from the rest of the campaign) of the 'special operation' was for the most part, a failure that resulted in serious losses.

Ultimately it doesn't really give too much attention to certain rather popular points of speculation, like ones that involve Putin's Covid isolation and how he relied too much on the FSB to plan a supposed Czechoslovakia invasion type coup in Ukraine, instead of letting the GRU and the Army take charge for the most part with the intent of waging an actual war, but I have never read a solid article that really put emphasis on those theories even though I'm rather fond of them myself so I can't help with that.\n\n[This](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/interactive/2022/ukraine-road-to-war/) very comprehensive and detailed article by The Washington Post is one of the best articles I've read so far that while of course, sometimes slanted, it manages to almost perfectly recapture the lead-up to this war which gives us more knowledge to properly speculate about Putin's pre-invasion plans and intentions.

Russian arty tactical groups can be disseminated down to the battalion tactical group, which means they might have ASPs at that level and up, at brigade, division, CAA/tank army/army corps, military district, or \"Operational Group of Russian Forces\" (an operational level command structure Jomini of the West routinely mentions). At each level they have likely dispersed the ASPs as a countermeasure against the PGM strikes, so there are more of them and of smaller size, creating a scenario where there are more to find and destroy but that each destroyed is of less value because they're smaller size.

Clear propaganda statements don't count. This narrative seems to be assumed, but the general official line in this conflict seems to be maintaining a free and independent democratic Ukraine. Even the closest statement we have to the above position from US SecDef Austin does not specifically call for eliminating Russia as a great power. He said, \"\u201cWe want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can\u2019t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine.\" Nowhere does this indicate the need to remove Russia as a great power (which in and of itself is a nebulous term). Even then, Austin's statement was not championed as the hallmark policy of the US support for Ukraine. It was not really parroted by the administration in serious terms. The focus is clearly on keeping Ukraine free, which necessarily entails weakening Russia, and punishing Russia for its egregious violation of the international order and its various norms, which necessarily entails weakening Russia. Obviously this benefits the West, but it's far from outright pursuing a course to destroy Russia. In fact, the idea of a complete collapse of Russia is something that I see most serious policymakers and experts balk at, if only because the resulting aftermath would cause so many problems. Furthermore, if Russia is losing its great power status, it's far more to do with the poor political, economic, and social decision making of its ruling class and its incredibly poor decision to engage in an egotistical war of hateful conquest than it is Western machinations. Ukraine is, at its heart, an entirely self-inflicted wound.  \n\n\n>But many people believe that a decisive, major victory is inevitable.

If anything, Western analysts have been struggling to explain why Ukraine has done so well, much less trumpeting the idea that Ukraine will inevitably secure a major victory.

            "body": "The F-16 is a rather versatile platform and a relatively cheaper option. The upfront cost per plane for the F-16 C/D Block 50 is around $33.3 million adjusted for today\u2019s inflation, somewhere between $50 and $60 million for a Block 60 and for the Block 70/72 it is around $64 million. Of course, that excludes cost of maintenance, training, and upgrades. \n\nAnd yes, the F-16 is vulnerable to SAMs however, it does have countermeasures. It can carry an ECM pod, ECM standing for Electronic Countermeasures, which can jam enemy search and tracking radars, hindering the enemy SAM\u2019s capability to acquire and lock on the target. However, the bigger picture has to do with SEAD, Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses. Yes, other fighters can perform SEAD with anti-radiation missile like those modified MiGs but there are only a few out there. So, if Ukraine gets more of these planes that can perform SEAD, they can potentially gain air superiority on a local scale at least. However, SEAD sorties are dangerous  hence why the US Air Force and Navy places a lot of emphasis on extensively training pilots on how to conduct SEAD without getting splashed. What Ukraine needs isn\u2019t just more planes, they also need well trained pilots to pilot those planes. \n\nHowever, suppose that Ukraine is able to gain air superiority over Kherson. That opens a lot of options to strike where artillery systems like HIMAR can\u2019t strike and for aircraft to assume the role of compromising Russian lines of communication while the artillery focus on supporting the infantry on the frontline. Of course, this hinges on gaining air superiority in the region.\n\nIn short, the F-16 with well-trained pilots would be theoretically be able to conduct SEAD with HARMs or standoff munitions, allowing for opportunities to perform air-to-ground strikes against Russian lines of communication which would allow artillery to focus on supporting the infantry on the frontlines. Note that I kept the mission scope rather limited. That is due to my assumption that the United States would only grant Ukraine a small amount of F-16s if they are granted at all.\n\nOn the other hand, we probably won\u2019t be seeing F-16s over Ukraine for some time if at all. Although some Ukrainians claim that they can learn how to fly a F-16 in a relatively short period of time, as I said before, Ukraine needs well trained pilots otherwise the F-16s might as well be useless. MiGs modified to be able to fire NATO armaments would be a better investment of time and money as having a whole new plane requires a whole new logistics chain to operate them. Ukrainian logistics are taxed as is. We don\u2019t want to compound the issue. \n\nBut that is just my take on things.\n\nEdit: \nThere is also other factors that help. The F-16 has more modern sensors than their Russian counterparts, being able to detect and acquire radar signatures from further away. There is also data link to consider which allows the pilot to see what another plane has detected with its sensors. The AMRAAM is also important as it is an active radar guided missile (Fox 3), meaning it is for the most part fire-and-forget. What the Ukrainians have now is a R-27, a semi-active-radar-guided missile (Fox 1). This means you have to point the aircraft\u2019s nose towards the radar signature continuously until it hopefully hits the target. What the AMRAAM allows is the ability to defend. Consider a BVR fight. The side that is able to detect the other from further away has the advantage. They fire off their Fox 3s and then often, maneuver to defeat the enemy missile that might\u2019ve been launched. That what I mean by \u201cdefend\u201d. Although as a note, there is a mid-course update option for the AMRAAM which allows the AMRAAM to update its course based off corrections from the aircraft that launched it. All you need to do here is keep the tango on your radar. The R-27 can\u2019t do that. From launch to impact, you are forced to keep your nose pointed at the target in order to \u201cilluminate\u201d it via a continuous-wave radar. The radar only illuminates radar signatures in a narrow \u201ccone\u201d right in front of the plane. Your plane\u2019s radar acts as the missile\u2019s guidance system meaning that the missile will become unguided if radar contact is broken. If the enemy already has their missiles launched and defending. If all you have are Fox 1s, you will always be the reactive side.   Trying to defend while still keeping the Fox 1 on target is a pain. If you don\u2019t get out of the way of that Fox 3 you will get splashed. If you maneuver, you lost another chance to fire your Fox 1. Meanwhile the tango probably has another Fox 3 out. There\u2019s a reason why the AIM-7 Sparrow gets no love. It\u2019s completely outclassed by the AIM-120 AMRAAM in air-to-air combat. (The calculus does change when it is a SAM though.) The Ukrainians only have Fox 1s. The Russians have Fox 3s although Fox 1s are still in use. Do the math and it doesn\u2019t look good for the Ukrainians. Against a competent Russian pilot with a well maintained fighter has the ability to gain and retain the initiative in a BVR fight against a comparable Ukrainian pilot. That said, no guarantees that the Russians have well maintained aircraft with competent pilots. \n\nA F-16 with AMRAAMs changes the calculus. They\u2019re simply better at BVR than whatever Ukraine  has now. In other words, it levels the playing field. Albeit, when it comes to BVR and dogfights, who wins is mostly dependent on the pilots\u2019 skills and ability. For example, a F-16 pilot in a dogfight would do well to force the enemy pilot into a 2 circle fight on the deck where the F-16 can leverage its high thrust to weight ratio, while making sure that their own aircraft doesn\u2019t lose too much speed. The Flanker pilot would do well to leverage the aircraft\u2019s supermaneuverability to either get out of a sticky situation or to produce one for the opponent.\n\nThe reason why I neglected to mention this is due to the prevalence of SAMs. That said the potential for air to air combat is something I can\u2019t pass judgement here. All I know is that there are a lot more planes that were shot down by SAMs than those shot down by another plane. \n\nAnother user mentioned a recce pod. I\u2019ll quickly go over the AN/ASQ-236 Dragon\u2019s Eye Radar Pod. What it allows is surveillance and target detection in all-weather conditions. It can precisely geo-locate fixed, moving and maritime targets as well as assess the damage done by bombs. No need to fly over to check if the target is dead or not, the radar will do that for you. There are also the optical ones although, they aren\u2019t exactly game changing with drones being able to do the same. \n\nBut once again, what Ukraine needs is well trained pilots. F-16s are nice and all but they might as well be useless in the wrong hands. Trying to rush training would be a bad idea. On-site training while sufficient for other occupations is not so suitable when \u201con-site training\u201d means being sent to an active war zone littered with SAMs and MANPADs.",

Disloyalty to your country is grounds for revoking citizenship internationally. This case is a UK government issue and in this case the UK government has decided that she does not meet the condition of citizenship. The people of the UK also agree beyond a supermajority.

Since this war has started, Ukraine has already launched counteroffensives in Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Kherson already. Every month since May, like clockwork, they've launched a brigade plus sized counterattack against the western side of Izyum. \n\nA paper strength UAF brigade has the exact same amount of arty as a paper strength Russian brigade.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/92nd_Mechanized_Brigade_(Ukraine)\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/74th_Separate_Guards_Motor_Rifle_Brigade\n\nEach has two battalions of cannon arty, one battalion of rocket arty, and one battalion of antitank arty. \n\nThe only way the UAF lags in arty is if the Russians masses more units in a location where the UAF haven't massed enough, if the UAF are relying on TDF brigades who are the only brigade type who don't have organic arty, if the UAF brigades arty strength is much lower than paper through attrition while the Russian arty haven't suffered heavy attrition, the UAF can't resupply ammo so they're limited in daily ammo consumption making tube count inside invalid, or through EW jamming they can't find targets to hit with drones or radars while the Russians can. \n\nEvery one of those was why the Russians outgunned the UAF in the Donbas. If they are a problem in Kherson, it's because the UA govt telegraphed for two months that they were going to conduct an offensive there so the Russians could mass more forces there to defend it. Even then, being on the offensive the UAF should have the initiative to pick the location and time for attacks, so they can still localize an extremely heavy force concentration of arty to drastically outgun the Russians.\n\nPGMs are not needed for counterbattery, it's been done since the Napoleonic era using direct fire with unguided projectiles and since WW1 using various techniques to perform counterbattery using indirect fire with unguided projectiles.",

Every month since May, like clockwork, they&#39;ve launched a brigade plus sized counterattack against the western side of Izyum. </p>\n\n<p>A paper strength UAF brigade has the exact same amount of arty as a paper strength Russian brigade.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/92nd_Mechanized_Brigade_(Ukraine)\">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/92nd_Mechanized_Brigade_(Ukraine)</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/74th_Separate_Guards_Motor_Rifle_Brigade\">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/74th_Separate_Guards_Motor_Rifle_Brigade</a></p>\n\n<p>Each has two battalions of cannon arty, one battalion of rocket arty, and one battalion of antitank arty. </p>\n\n<p>The only way the UAF lags in arty is if the Russians masses more units in a location where the UAF haven&#39;t massed enough, if the UAF are relying on TDF brigades who are the only brigade type who don&#39;t have organic arty, if the UAF brigades arty strength is much lower than paper through attrition while the Russian arty haven&#39;t suffered heavy attrition, the UAF can&#39;t resupply ammo so they&#39;re limited in daily ammo consumption making tube count inside invalid, or through EW jamming they can&#39;t find targets to hit with drones or radars while the Russians can. </p>\n\n<p>Every one of those was why the Russians outgunned the UAF in the Donbas. If they are a problem in Kherson, it&#39;s because the UA govt telegraphed for two months that they were going to conduct an offensive there so the Russians could mass more forces there to defend it. Even then, being on the offensive the UAF should have the initiative to pick the location and time for attacks, so they can still localize an extremely heavy force concentration of arty to drastically outgun the Russians.</p>\n\n<p>PGMs are not needed for counterbattery, it&#39;s been done since the Napoleonic era using direct fire with unguided projectiles and since WW1 using various techniques to perform counterbattery using indirect fire with unguided projectiles.</p>\n</div>",

Does the ferry sit at one end for 3 hours waiting for 10 trucks or does it cross when 3 trucks arrive? \n\nIdeally, you'd want the 10 trucks to show up right when the ferry is unloaded so the ferry remains mobile the maximum amount of time. How do you organize that with supplies coming from 50 miles away?
