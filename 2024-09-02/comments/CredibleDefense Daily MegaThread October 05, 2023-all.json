High explosive explosions can get way more complicated to model indeed.</p>\n\n<p>The properties of explosions by general purpose bombs are fairly simple and are well characterized by the pressure after a given amount of expansion (and heat).</p>\n</div>",

In mid-June, after surviving weeks of gunfire and rockets directed at the Masalit, a black African ethnic group, she fled el-Geneina, the capital of the state of West Darfur in Sudan. Hoisting her 23-month-old baby boy, Sabir, onto her back she started walking towards Chad. Yet fighters wearing the uniforms of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) soon surrounded them.\n\n> They dragged men to the side of the road and told the women to run. Before she could do so, a gunman wrenched open the shawl on her back that covered Sabir. \u201cNo men can escape to Chad,\u201d he shouted. Then he shot her baby in the head.\n\n>In Chad a humanitarian worker identifies four other mothers who tell of similar horrors. One says she was stopped at a roadblock where Arab militiamen murdered the men in her group. When they saw her 15-month-old son strapped to her, they shot him dead as he clung to her. The bullet burst through his tiny body and into hers, where it remains lodged. \u201cIf that isn\u2019t a genocidal act, I don\u2019t know what is,\u201d says Mukesh Kapila, a former UN chief in Sudan who blew the whistle on massacres in Darfur 20 years ago.\n\n>Back in 2003, armed groups from black African tribes in Darfur rebelled against the Arab-dominated government in Khartoum, the capital. The government responded by arming Arab militias known as the Janjaweed (\u201cdevils on horseback\u201d). They indiscriminately attacked villages inhabited by black Africans, not just rebels, torching houses and shooting residents. They also seized land, access to which is a continuing source of tension. In roughly the two years that followed, millions fled and perhaps 170,000 died, about 80% of them from hunger and disease.\n\n>America and several NGOs said that this amounted to genocide, though others disagreed. A report to the UN Security Council argued that \u201cthe crucial element of genocidal intent appears to be missing.\u201d In 2007 the UN and the African Union deployed a joint peacekeeping mission. \n\n>Intermittent violence continued, but hopes rose of a durable peace in 2019 after the toppling of Sudan\u2019s longtime dictator, Omar al-Bashir. Few people were held accountable for the earlier war crimes and the peacekeepers were withdrawn in 2021.\n\n>In April this year war broke out between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the RSF, a paramilitary formed by the government from the Janjaweed. The fighting has pulverised much of Khartoum. In Darfur it has triggered attacks on the Masalit by Arab militias and rsf fighters. This time the targeting of the Masalit is clear, says Kholood Khair of Confluence Advisory, a Sudanese think-tank. \u201cGenocidal intent this time is much more explicit.\u201d\n\n>Ali Yagoub Idris recounts how from a hiding place he saw rsf fighters force eight people to lie down while shouting: \u201cYou are Masalit, you are not allowed in this town.\u201d Then they shot all eight of them. \n\n>Elsewhere people lied about their ethnicity to survive. But speaking with a Masalait accent could mean death. un data appear to back up allegations that men are being singled out and shot when they try to leave, as only one adult man reaches Chad from el-Geneina for roughly every two adult women who do so. Arab militias also tried to hunt down particular Masalit leaders such as Hatim Abdallah El Fadil, a vocal civil-society activist. \u201cI was on a list,\u201d he says.\n\n>Zahara Adam Khamis, a women\u2019s rights activist, weeps as she recounts how a 27-year-old university student she knows was gang-raped by five militiamen in front of her mother. \u201dThe baby will be Arab,\u201d they said as they finished.\n\n>The fighting in West Darfur also appears more one-sided than in 2003, when the conflict began with rebel attacks. This time, after skirmishes between the RSF and the SAF in el-Geneina in April, government forces quickly retreated as the RSF, aided by Arab militias, attacked Masalit neighbourhoods. Some Masalit descended on a police-weapons depot where policemen allowed the crowd to grab Kalashnikov rifles. Yet the Masalit were outgunned. No one knows exactly how many were killed, but the un has credible reports of at least 13 mass graves. On June 14th the governor of West Darfur, a Masalit, publicly accused the RSF of genocide. Hours later he was gruesomely killed, reportedly by RSF forces, a charge they deny.\n\n>Even after people fled from towns they faced murder and ambush on the way to Chad. Bodies littered the road. One man, call him Khalid as he asked that we not use his real name, fled to Chad in 2003 without facing violence on the way. This time he tried to reach Chad safely by taking a route far to the south at night with a group of about a hundred people. Yet as they neared the border, headlights lit them up. Seconds later the firing started, killing around 20.\n\n>Today the RSF wields not just Kalashnikov rifles but also rocket-launchers and machineguns. The difference is grimly evident at a hospital in the Chadian town of Adr\u00e9, close to the border with Sudan. Before Abdul Samad was hit by a rocket he hoped to be an electrician. Now the 19-year-old sits looking at the stump of his right leg and the mangled clump of burnt flesh that is all that remains of his left foot.\n\n>The RSF has heavier weapons thanks to foreign backers. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is understood still to be shipping weapons to the rsf through Chad. A $1.5bn loan from the UAE to Chad seemingly smoothed the way. Evidence for this traffic is \u201cpretty clear\u201d, says a Western diplomat. The New York Times reported that weapons are being shipped under the guise of an aid mission. The UAE has said its operation is purely humanitarian.\n\n>In parts of West Darfur there has been a lull in violence since the terrible peaks of June. That is partly because in some places fully 70% of the population has fled. More than 420,000 went to Chad. The mud of the rainy season also makes it difficult for the RSF to mount large attacks on other towns and villages. But the rains are ending and the chances of calm are fading, both in Darfur and between the RAF and SAF \u201cWe will see a very distinct uptick in the level of violence,\u201d predicts Ms Khair. Many also fear there will be more air strikes by the SAF which last month bombed a market in Nyala, the capital of South Darfur.\n\n>Some among the Masalit, meanwhile, are said to be training to fight and are trying to arm themselves in Chad. Ismat Adam Abdallah is a soft-spoken English teacher. But after 18 members of his extended family were killed, he has changed. \u201cWe will take it back by force,\u201d he says of their lost land. \u201cWe need weapons, we need vehicles.\u201d Would he fight? \u201cYes,\u201d he avers vigorously, \u201cbecause I lost everything.\u201d",

It was always a little iffy for issues polling like this, but it used to be pretty good for elections polling. \n\nOne major kink in the system is the methodology. In decades past, culture was such that calling someone out of the blue was perfectly acceptable. People would pick up, hear that a pollster wanted their opinion, and were happy to give it. Now, especially with the younger generations, who answers the phone for a random number? Could be a bill collector or spammer. Could be your mom you went NC with. Could be anyone, so why bother answering.\n\nPeople also used to exclusively have landlines instead of cell phones. Pollers often couldn't handle cell phones well for a variety of reasons. Many pollsters use robo-polling to be cheap, for instance, and these were banned in some states (Indiana comes to mind, but I know others are the same). It is also much more difficult to get a list of numbers that actually live in the district or state you're polling. For example, I've had my current number for like fifteen years now. I haven't lived in the area I got it for almost ten years. Cell phones are a major hindrance to polling methodology.\n\nTo make up for these problems, pollsters started using online polling. This is fraught with all kinds of issues. Who's taking the poll? How do you know they're actually Americans? Who gets selected? Who tends to answer online polls (millennial and gen X, educated, people with high institutional trust, etc) versus who would answer a landline poll (old, traditional, probably far from a cell tower, etc).\n\nFinally, trust in media has fallen off a cliff, and they're the ones who tend to do polls. NYT-Sienna either was or is a big name in the polling business. If you're a Trump voter and you hear the NYT is calling, are you likely to pick up for their \"fake News poll from the Failing New York Times\"? If you're a Biden voter and you hear Fox News call, are you likely to pick up for a \"conservative propaganda poll that literally causes violence to marginalized peoples of identity\"? In short, unintentional sampling bias is overwhelmingly to blame for the reduction in polling accuracy. There's absolutely nothing we can do about it short of remaking American culture.\n\nHonestly, I wish I had an easy answer to give. I followed political polling and analysis to an unhealthy degree ever since the 2012 election. To see the state it's in now has made me incredibly jaded towards political science. I think we just need to accept that we're unable to accurately predict political sentiments anymore. I guess if I were to offer an answer, I'd say systematic focus group polling that tested *messaging* rather than current sentiments. One thing that jumped out to me about this poll is that a quarter of respondents simply weren't sure about Ukraine aid. How would they react to isolationist messaging versus interventionist messaging? That would probably clue me in on whether there's strong baseline support or opposition, or whether Americans are more apathetic. For example, can you think of an issue that doesn't matter much to you? In my case, I'd say capital gains taxes don't matter much to me. Would I say \"yes\" to a poll that asked me if capital gains should be taxed at a higher rate? Sure. Tax 'em. Would I vote based on that? Not really.",

Because again - for the cheap seats - in Iraq and Afghanistan AMERICANS died on a regular basis. People came home in coffins. With PTSD. With missing arms and legs. And that was on the nightly news.\n\nIn fact in [a poll from 2007](https://web.archive.org/web/20170214093020/http://pollingreport.com/iraq3.htm), only 32% of American respondents said the war was worth the continued American casualties. \n\nAdd to that that the Iraq war was in part based on a lie that WMDs had been present, and you have an entirely disanalogous situation.",

You can&#39;t draw the conclusion that because the media you personally consume don&#39;t propagate Russian talking points, therefore they are not pervasive in the media landscape elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>Have a look at Fox News, OANNN, Newsmaxx etc.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The point is in the aggregate pro-Ukraine voices in the US far outnumber any pro-Putin/Russia voices, so the notion that US public support for Ukraine is sagging because of &quot;Russian propaganda&quot; is simply not credible</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You drawing a conclusion based on no evidence. You&#39;ve decided that &quot;pro-Ukraine voices in the US far outnumber any pro-Putin/Russia voices&quot; but you&#39;ve not shown that.  You understand that Tucker Carlson had the highest rated show on cable news until his ouster a few months ago, right? So if the highest rated &#39;news&#39; show is spouting pro-Putin propaganda, how exactly is not credible that that is affecting public support significantly?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>More credible explanation is general public aversion to endless wars and failure of Ukraine to make meaningful advances. It&#39;s interesting you mention Iraq and Afghanistan because I think the US public&#39;s experiences of those wars affect their disposition to Russo-Ukraine war. In both Iraq and Afghanistan, US public support turned sour after events on the ground showed the US was bogged down in a quagmire and what they were told (Mission Accomplished, Iraqis will welcome US troops with flowers, etc.) did not match realities on the ground.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>No. That is absolutely not more credible. Because again - for the cheap seats - in Iraq and Afghanistan AMERICANS died on a regular basis. People came home in coffins. With PTSD. With missing arms and legs. And that was on the nightly news.</p>\n\n<p>In fact in <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20170214093020/http://pollingreport.com/iraq3.htm\">a poll from 2007</a>, only 32% of American respondents said the war was worth the continued American casualties. </p>\n\n<p>Add to that that the Iraq war was in part based on a lie that WMDs had been present, and you have an entirely disanalogous situation.</p>\n</div>",

As I said, I find the distinction too academic, and a decent chunk of the existing literature agrees: it matters little whether you're being oppressed by a *colonial* or *imperial* power. Indeed, a Russian in the 19th century would claim to be a \"colonial\" power - what's interesting; however, is that a Brit or Frenchmen might actually *disagree* and say that Russians aren't quite *good enough* at colonialism to qualify. \n\nAgain, it's an academic distinction. My personal opinion is that it *really doesn't matter* in the 21st century if you're colonial or imperial - both things have fallen out of vogue. What matters is the extent to which we believe the remnants of imperial or colonial conquest should be independent and much of history tells us that this is where the distinction matters: colonial powers must give up their conquest, but imperial powers? not so much.",

                            "body": "Here's a handy map https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Territorial_Expansion_of_Russia.svg\n\nSo basically, everything from Krasnoyarsk west was settled from the mid-18th century on, so roughly in line with French and British colonial conquests in the Americas, and only slightly after the Russian conquest of the Baltics and slightly earlier than their conquest of Kyiv. Their 19th century expansion was primarily into Central Asia, the Caucuses, and a little in the far west around Manchuria. During which time the British and French were expanding their footprint in India, China, and Africa. The vast overwhelming majority of which colonies the Brits and French have now given up control over, in many cases willingly or at least in enforced cooperation with local governments such as in India for the British or Indo-China for the French. Russia unwillingly lost control over the Baltics, Ukraine, Central Asia, and the Caucuses during the break up of the Soviet Union, but has otherwise never parted with its colonial holdings, willingly or unwillingly. Barring perhaps the sale of Alaska, although Russian control there was never more than nominal. \n\nThe primary difference between the trajectories of the western European colonial empires and the Russian empire is likely in large part attributable to their relationship with the United States. The US, for all its faults, fought hard to restrain the colonial impulses of its allies, including after WW1, during WW2, and during the Cold War.  Wilson's anti-colonialism was a source of tension at the Paris Peace Conference, as were both Roosevelt's and Truman's during trilateral negotiations with Churchill and Stalin. (As an aside, I am often baffled by (typically liberal, which I say as a liberal myself) American criticism of US foreign policy as imperialist and colonialist when the history of American foreign policy from the Spanish-American War onward demonstrates an incredibly strong and consistent opposition to colonialism in general, with perhaps the notable exception of the Native Americans in the continental US, although I'd argue that genie couldn't be put back in the bottle after 1850 or so. I'd swear none of those people have ever even read a history book at all.).\n\nAmerican anti-colonialism has always been an enormous sticking point in its relationship especially with France, which continues to prioritize \"strategic autonomy\" from American decision-making to this day almost entirely because of historical disagreements about France's empire in the post-war era (e.g., over Indo-China, leading eventually to America's reluctant involvement in Vietnam), which has been one of the few enduring disagreements between the two nations during their long history of alliance and cooperation. Britain by contrast decolonized much more willingly than France during that period. At least following Harold MacMillan's famous \"Winds of Change\" speech in 1960, so post-Suez Canal Crisis, but still relatively early on in the Cold War. Which in turn helped smooth over the last major political difference inhibiting the \"Special Relationship.\" Without pressure from the US, the British and French empires may not have come to such a dramatic end during the post-war era. It's difficult to imagine Apartheid ending without economic pressure from the US and other countries, as one very concrete example (and assuming that Apartheid was a colonial institution held over after nominal decolonization of South Africa).  \n\nRussia, by contrast, was the big dog in its own sphere of influence, and did not need to cave to pressure from the US or any other country. Moreover, as part of the Soviet Union, it could lay claim to a universalist anti-colonial ideology in the form of communism/Stalinist-Leninism, at least in theory. In practice, Moscow's relentless centralization and autocratic leanings prevented and continues to prevent the local self-determination that true decolonization provides. In the modern era, however, Russia lacks any universalist ideology to provide even a fig leaf of justification for Moscow's domination of its former colonies, which makes the possibility of Balkanization that much more pressing and threatening.

                            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Here&#39;s a handy map <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Territorial_Expansion_of_Russia.svg\">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Territorial_Expansion_of_Russia.svg</a></p>\n\n<p>So basically, everything from Krasnoyarsk west was settled from the mid-18th century on, so roughly in line with French and British colonial conquests in the Americas, and only slightly after the Russian conquest of the Baltics and slightly earlier than their conquest of Kyiv. Their 19th century expansion was primarily into Central Asia, the Caucuses, and a little in the far west around Manchuria. During which time the British and French were expanding their footprint in India, China, and Africa. The vast overwhelming majority of which colonies the Brits and French have now given up control over, in many cases willingly or at least in enforced cooperation with local governments such as in India for the British or Indo-China for the French. Russia unwillingly lost control over the Baltics, Ukraine, Central Asia, and the Caucuses during the break up of the Soviet Union, but has otherwise never parted with its colonial holdings, willingly or unwillingly. Barring perhaps the sale of Alaska, although Russian control there was never more than nominal. </p>\n\n<p>The primary difference between the trajectories of the western European colonial empires and the Russian empire is likely in large part attributable to their relationship with the United States. The US, for all its faults, fought hard to restrain the colonial impulses of its allies, including after WW1, during WW2, and during the Cold War.  Wilson&#39;s anti-colonialism was a source of tension at the Paris Peace Conference, as were both Roosevelt&#39;s and Truman&#39;s during trilateral negotiations with Churchill and Stalin. (As an aside, I am often baffled by (typically liberal, which I say as a liberal myself) American criticism of US foreign policy as imperialist and colonialist when the history of American foreign policy from the Spanish-American War onward demonstrates an incredibly strong and consistent opposition to colonialism in general, with perhaps the notable exception of the Native Americans in the continental US, although I&#39;d argue that genie couldn&#39;t be put back in the bottle after 1850 or so. I&#39;d swear none of those people have ever even read a history book at all.).</p>\n\n<p>American anti-colonialism has always been an enormous sticking point in its relationship especially with France, which continues to prioritize &quot;strategic autonomy&quot; from American decision-making to this day almost entirely because of historical disagreements about France&#39;s empire in the post-war era (e.g., over Indo-China, leading eventually to America&#39;s reluctant involvement in Vietnam), which has been one of the few enduring disagreements between the two nations during their long history of alliance and cooperation. Britain by contrast decolonized much more willingly than France during that period. At least following Harold MacMillan&#39;s famous &quot;Winds of Change&quot; speech in 1960, so post-Suez Canal Crisis, but still relatively early on in the Cold War. Which in turn helped smooth over the last major political difference inhibiting the &quot;Special Relationship.&quot; Without pressure from the US, the British and French empires may not have come to such a dramatic end during the post-war era. It&#39;s difficult to imagine Apartheid ending without economic pressure from the US and other countries, as one very concrete example (and assuming that Apartheid was a colonial institution held over after nominal decolonization of South Africa).  </p>\n\n<p>Russia, by contrast, was the big dog in its own sphere of influence, and did not need to cave to pressure from the US or any other country. Moreover, as part of the Soviet Union, it could lay claim to a universalist anti-colonial ideology in the form of communism/Stalinist-Leninism, at least in theory. In practice, Moscow&#39;s relentless centralization and autocratic leanings prevented and continues to prevent the local self-determination that true decolonization provides. In the modern era, however, Russia lacks any universalist ideology to provide even a fig leaf of justification for Moscow&#39;s domination of its former colonies, which makes the possibility of Balkanization that much more pressing and threatening.

It will never be perfect, but the system strives for that. \n\nI believe it was Hans Kelsen (someone I never loved) who once posited that the ground rule of any system is the preservation of said system. If there's such a thing as a base law for any system, is that the system must resits to its eradication by all means, including the exercise of the monopoly of force, and that should be the cornerstone of the whole system.\n\nThis is also why Hans Kelsen theories were misused in the 20th century (you can probably guess by whom). \n\nBut he's not wrong, and even after WWII that theory was kind of what underpinned the strange friendships made during the cold war. Realpolitik is often used as the go-to explanation, but you have to ask yourself why Realpolitik as a thing even existed - and the explanation is offered by Hans Kelsen's General Theory of Law and the State, but now applied on an international dimension (arguably personified in Public International Law).

It's not even comparable to the USSR - we are talking about a post-ideological state that basically grabs all that's useful from the USSR, the free market, fascism, and national-conservativism. It's a chimera, as most fascist states are, because as Umberto Eco once pointed out, unlike in far left politics, there really isn't much of a playbook for the far right - everything goes. \n\nYou could talk to the USSR. Many countries did. You can't really talk to Putin - you're not talking to a Soviet statesmen, just like when you're talking to Kim you're not talking to a statesman, you're talking to a cult leader.

For example, they could have been collecting these videos for months and are now releasing them all at once to give the impression that there is an uptick in strikes to compensate for a reduction in traditional artillery strikes resulting from ammunition shortages, whereas in reality they have been conducting far rear area strikes with Tornado-S at a consistent rate throughout the war. It's worth noting that no one other than the Russians is likely to possess significant footage of rear area strikes because unlike a frontline area, the Ukrainians are not also flying drones gathering their own footage nor would they be routinely recording random activities like unloading ammo from a train or infantry gathering in the open for training or similar rear area activities that might become targets for Tornado-S. Which means that the Russians have total freedom to release footage when and how they want without worrying about someone else releasing similar video at a different time or in contradiction to the narrative they are trying to shape.\n\nBottom line: I would first consider the likely intended propaganda effect of these releases before attempting to read more into their actual strategic, operational, or tactical significance. In this case, my instinct is to consider it an effort to counter growing criticism of their inability to provide sufficient artillery ammunition and counterbattery capabilities to the frontlines, especially in western Zaporizhzhia. I would venture a guess that the Russians have been husbanding these videos to release at a time when they lack other good news to promote a positive narrative, and so we are not seeing any significant change in the quantity of Tornado-S strikes. Until we hear the Ukrainians also reporting that Tornado-S strikes are causing them significant difficulty and that they require specific additional assistance to counter the threat, I would assume that the strikes are merely an occasional irritant but not sufficiently intense, frequent, or well-targeted enough to matter much for the overall strategic and operational picture. \n\nEdit: And I say I would wait until we hear the Ukrainians reporting difficulty because that is what has happened with every other major Russian threat during the war.

            "body": "IMHO it's one of those \"yes, but\" things, as the transactional/non-transactional dichotomy is largely based on competing foreign and regional interests, whereas the Russia-Belarus relation has a significant domestic policy component.\n\nStrictly speaking, yes, absolutely. Russia and Belarus have compatible regional interests and share the same external threats. Theirs is an alliance that can work just fine in the absence of detailed and perpetual cost-benefit analysis. I'm not sure if it counts as the *only* one. Most other countries with compatible regional interests and a history of good relations with Russia are either not formally allied at this point (India) or have seen mutual relations sour to some degree (Azerbaijan), but it's a murkier discussion if we're also talking about remoter nominal allies, like South Africa.\n\nThe \"yes, but\" part is that the transactional/non-transactional distinction implicitly assumes a high degree of free agency in working out regional interests, but it's hard to say how much of that Belarus actually has. Geographically, Belarus could swing either way, and it has strong cultural ties, and historically good infrastructure connecting it with, its Baltic neighbours and Ukraine. Even a moderate realignment, which could make Belarus a major transit hub between the Black Sea and the Baltic, or at least a bigger Baltic transit hub, might be an attractive economic option, but it won't happen because Lukashenko's regime depends on Russian guarantees and the EU won't have him.\n\nThe non-transactional status of the Russia-Belarus alliance masks the *very* transactional status of the relationship between the two governments. Lukashenko's government is conceding a lot of the autonomy that it's technically entitled to as the government of a sovereign regime in exchange for both the \"hard\" security guarantees that keep its regime in power and the \"soft\" economic benefits that allow Belarus to sacrifice the tighter economic ties with its other neighbours, which it would benefit from enormously. Both of these go directly against the fundamental interests of any state:  conceding national sovereignty and economic agency, even to a nominal ally, is not exactly how these things should work. But it's not a relationship that can easily fit the transactional model.\n\nTreating their alliance as non-transactional is correct IMHO, but it needs the addenda that it may have a more temporary status than a glance at the map would imply, and that it's carved out in the context of a high degree of political subordination in some areas (e.g. foreign affairs, economic integration etc.)",

[Just look at any maritime traffic monitoring service like MarineTraffic](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/home/centerx:35.9/centery:44.4/zoom:6), and you'll note that there is an enormous amount of civilian traffic in and out of Rostov and Novorossysk.\n\nThis exact moment represents a bit of a departure from the historical norms over the course of the war, in that there is about as much traffic in and out of Ukrainian ports on the Danube as there is into Russian ports. However, the Ukrainian traffic is a seasonal spike because of the grain harvest, and on an annual basis the amount of shipping into Russian ports on the Black Sea far exceeds the traffic into Ukrainian ports. Which was true in peacetime, too, but the trend has been significantly exaggerated by the near destruction of the Ukrainian economy during the war. No one, for example, is shipping megatons of steel out of Azovstal anymore, whereas Rostov remains as much if not even more important to the Russian economy as it was before the war.\n\nUltimately, this means that the Russians have substantially more civilian shipping that can be held at risk in the Black Sea than the Ukrainians do, and so any unrestricted warfare will open the Russians to more harm than they can conceivably hope to cause to the Ukrainians. I suspect one of the main reasons the Ukrainians targeted an oil tanker with their USVs a few weeks ago was to highlight this asymmetry to the Russians.

If the Russians cannot ship oil out of Rostov anymore, that will cost them far more in revenue than the Ukrainians not being able to ship grain out of the Danube ports would cost them.</p>\n</div>",
