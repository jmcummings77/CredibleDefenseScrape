[Here](https://x.com/nicholas6284/status/1743197461446004887?s=20) is footage. It appears they have taken the area without a fight.

Nearly 2,000 soldiers were given safe passage but had to eave their weapons behind. We should see the loot in the next day or two. It will be a lot.\n\nMeanwhile at Lashio, Junta forces have [blown bridges](https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/burma/surrounded-myanmar-junta-troops-shell-civilians-blow-bridges-in-lashio.html) in an attempt to halt TNLA advances. Artillery fire is hitting surrounding villages and forest areas.\n\nExpect Lashio to see fighting in the next weeks.

On this date, Ukraine took control back of Sumy.\n\nIt seems like a week of many announcements for new weapons comes in this week. The Russian retreat from Kyiv prompted many western governments to suddenly begin lifting restrictions on what could be sent. These links only form an excerpt as many other articles at the time discuss new shipments, new pledges, or 'discussion' on military aid. But it seems like April 7 was a pivotal day in the sequence of events, Ukraine doesn't abandon negotiations but there seems to be some kind of developing impasse over Ukrainian demands.\n\nApril 9: [Boris meets with Zelensky](https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/09/europe/ukraine-uk-boris-johnson-intl-gbr/index.html) and announces military aid directly after.\n\nApril 10: [Zelensky CBS interview](https://nypost.com/2022/04/10/zelensky-60-minutes-interview-reiterates-requests-for-arms-no-fly-zone/) in which Zelensky says he is not interested in diplomacy, but expresses skepticism that US will provide enough aid. Though this interview may have been April 9. [Jake Sullivan issues statements that US will send more weapons](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-will-supply-ukraine-with-the-weapons-it-needs-against-russia-2022-04-10/). New polling reveals massive public support for military aid.\n\nApril 11: Biden calls Russian war a genocide for first time, Zelensky reiterates need for tanks and other heavy weapons\n\nApril 12: Supposedly the last day of negotiations\n\nApril 13: [Putin publicly says negotiations are over](https://www.ft.com/content/6f6f74ae-56bd-45e7-ad40-51a87775f1a6)\n\nSo, it seems to me that there's not really any clear single cause of why the negotiations failed. Rather, it was a series of culminating events. Kyiv's negotiating stance was already hardening against outright capitulation as early as the 7th, after being bolstered by the beginning of deliveries of tanks and artillery. Johnson's promise of more military support likely further emboldened Zelensky not to negotiate. Russia calling its own massacres a Ukrainian provocation likely further upsets Kyiv.\n\nJohnson might have been the straw that broke the camel's back, but multiple things happened on the 9th, and the days before it.",

But it seems like April 7 was a pivotal day in the sequence of events, Ukraine doesn&#39;t abandon negotiations but there seems to be some kind of developing impasse over Ukrainian demands.</p>\n\n<p>April 9: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/09/europe/ukraine-uk-boris-johnson-intl-gbr/index.html\">Boris meets with Zelensky</a> and announces military aid directly after.</p>\n\n<p>April 10: <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2022/04/10/zelensky-60-minutes-interview-reiterates-requests-for-arms-no-fly-zone/\">Zelensky CBS interview</a> in which Zelensky says he is not interested in diplomacy, but expresses skepticism that US will provide enough aid. Though this interview may have been April 9. <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-will-supply-ukraine-with-the-weapons-it-needs-against-russia-2022-04-10/\">Jake Sullivan issues statements that US will send more weapons</a>. New polling reveals massive public support for military aid.</p>\n\n<p>April 11: Biden calls Russian war a genocide for first time, Zelensky reiterates need for tanks and other heavy weapons</p>\n\n<p>April 12: Supposedly the last day of negotiations</p>\n\n<p>April 13: <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6f6f74ae-56bd-45e7-ad40-51a87775f1a6\">Putin publicly says negotiations are over</a></p>\n\n<p>So, it seems to me that there&#39;s not really any clear single cause of why the negotiations failed. Rather, it was a series of culminating events. Kyiv&#39;s negotiating stance was already hardening against outright capitulation as early as the 7th, after being bolstered by the beginning of deliveries of tanks and artillery. Johnson&#39;s promise of more military support likely further emboldened Zelensky not to negotiate. Russia calling its own massacres a Ukrainian provocation likely further upsets Kyiv.</p>\n\n<p>Johnson might have been the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back, but multiple things happened on the 9th, and the days before it.</p>\n</div>",

Rather, it was a series of culminating events.\n\nYour links suggest pretty clearly that Russia wasn't going to budge from demands that it's hard to see Ukraine ever agreeing to. For instance:\n\n> April 6: [Ukrainian negotiators allegedly agree to a peace proposal with Russia](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-says-ukraine-presented-unacceptable-draft-peace-deal-2022-04-07/), Ukraine Lend Lease act is passed in US Senate\n\nClick on the article, and you get this:\n\n> Ukraine's new draft, according to Lavrov, said the status of Crimea, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014, should be raised at a meeting between the two countries' presidents.\n\n> It also said Ukraine could hold military drills with foreign countries without receiving Russia's permission, something Moscow disagrees with.\n\n> \"Such inability to agree once again highlights Kyiv's true intentions, its position of drawing out and even undermining the talks by moving away from the understandings reached,\" Lavrov said, adding that the proposals were \"unacceptable\".\n\nSo Russia wanted Ukraine to cede Crimea even before they'd let Zelesnky meet with Putin, and even the idea that Zelensky would talk about it with Putin was \"unacceptable.\" If you read my other links, you'll see that Lavrov was similarly demanding that Ukraine agree to cede the Donbas before Putin would meet with him.\n\nThe Russians claimed that Ukraine deviated from previous proposals. But if we look at the proposals that were made in the weeks before, that doesn't seem to be the case. For instance, [this is from March 29](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/29/world/europe/peace-talks-russia-ukraine.html):\n\n> Ukraine also signaled readiness to consider concessions related to the parts of its territory already occupied by Russia. It proposed a 15-year negotiating process for Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula seized by Russia in 2014, and said it was ready to rule out trying to retake it by force. Questions surrounding the eastern Donbas region, Ukrainian officials said, could be discussed at a possible meeting between Mr. Putin and Mr. Zelensky.\n\nRussia pretty clearly stated that they were demanding nothing less than Ukraine ceding Crimea and the Donbas, and also giving Russia suzerainty over the country. They said it was unacceptable for Zelensky to even _meet_ with Putin to discuss these things in person - Ukraine's only options were to acquiesce to the demands, or face more war. When Ukraine didn't acquiesce, the Russians pulled out of the negotiations.\n\nAgain, this isn't speculation, this is what the Russians specifically said at the time. The only part that's open for debate is Russia's claim that the Ukrainians had agreed to acquiesce to all their demands and then changed their minds. But looking at all of the articles about negotiations from the time, this doesn't seem to be the case at all (it's also hard to see how Zelensky could have politically survived such a total surrender, the Russian demands were pretty extreme).",

After 90 days of war, we have the first real murmurings of a (alleged) \"day after\" plan for Gaza from the Israeli government. Critical point 1. No resettlements. Critical point 2. No PA. \n\nHere's The Plan:\n\n>The defense minister\u2019s plan, which has already been presented to the US administration and discussed with other allies, has four \u201cpillars\u201d for civil rule in post-war Gaza.\n\n>First, Israel will coordinate and plan an oversight role in civil governance, and be responsible for inspecting incoming goods.\n\n>Second, a multinational task force, led by the US in partnership with European and moderate Arab nations, will take responsibility for running civil affairs and the economic rehabilitation of the Strip.\n\n>Third, Egypt, which is noted as a \u201cmajor actor\u201d in the plan, will take responsibility for the main civilian border crossing into the Gaza Strip, in coordination with Israel.\n\n>Fourth, existing Palestinian administrative mechanisms will be maintained, provided that the relevant officials are not affiliated with Hamas. Local authorities that currently deal with sewage, electricity, water and humanitarian aid distribution will continue to operate, in collaboration with the multinational task force.\n\n>It is understood that Gallant envisages the transfer of relief and welfare responsibilities away from UNRWA, which Israel regards as \u201chostile,\u201d but that this would take time.\n\nThe Issue Of The Palestinian Authority:\n\n>In the press briefing, Gallant said that the question of possible Palestinian Authority involvement in post-war Gaza was not relevant at this stage, as it has not gone through necessary reforms.\n\n>However, the allies tapped for the multinational task force have repeatedly made clear that their support for the reconstruction of Gaza is conditioned on the PA being the governing body that reunites the Strip with the West Bank and that the process be part of a broader initiative aimed at an eventual two-state solution.\n\n>US and Israeli officials have told The Times of Israel that Netanyahu\u2019s aides have privately expressed their support for an \u201cRPA\u201d or \u201creformed PA,\u201d eventually governing Gaza,while the premier himself has not spoken publicly about this idea amid fears of alienating far-right ministers Smotrich and Itamar Ben Gvir.\n\nOn paper this seems like an acceptable temporary solution to the Israel-Gaza conflict. Yet the model of Israeli security oversight and Palestinian civil administration is largely seen as problematic in the west bank, in that it ultimately does not resolve the conflict long term.\n\nThe difficult part will be getting enough international partners on-board to make it work.

Is it the US-Europe-moderate Arab nations task force or is that more limited to bureaucratic matters, economic rehabilitation and trying to prevent mass starvation and disease?  Will it be the hoped for Reformed to Israeli satisfaction PA?  Someone else?</p>\n</div>",

            "body": ">While interesting, I don't think it is the way forward, as the production of hundreds of radars and sensor suits necessary would stall the procurement process.\n\nI'm not sure it would make much of a difference procurement wise. Any newer vehicle or piece of kit is going to go through the same design process, testing process, military trial/testing and other hurdles that more definitively new designs go through. Equipment that is closer to active production is likely to have more of a near term impact for front line units than anything that has still yet to pass many of the initial hurdles and for what it's worth the relative cost, at least financially, of upgrading some older Zu-23's is going to be far more palatable than the cost of designing and deploying an entirely new system at breakneck speed and that's assuming a newer system can be made available in a timely manner which doesn't rely on radar to avoid the possible procurement issues that you mentioned.   \n\n\nThe 2S38 Derivatsiya-PVO for example (Not saying you suggested this, just using it as an example of the procurement process) has had a six year (give or take a year depending on how you look at it) procurement process which isn't unusual for an entirely new SPAAG design. Now to say a new vehicle or custom hardware during war time would take a similar amount of time would be a bit silly, Russia have opened up the taps and military investment is through the roof, any design or production process is going to be greatly accelerated, but there's a certain amount of hard time that is inescapable.  \n\n\nThen we would also have to look at what this new vehicle would *\\*cost\\**, the Derivatsiya for example is based on a BMP-3 hull, that's a BMP that can no longer be delivered to front line infantry units. There's an opportunity cost to producing a new SPAAG, particularly if it relies upon an existing hull design for production synergy. (To be clear this is a wise move from a procurement standpoint, but it does pose an opportunity cost during war time when deliveries are relied upon to replace losses).  \n\n\nCompared to any new designs or new vehicles, the Zu-23 (Technically the Zu-23-M) is already in active service, it's already being upgraded and there are likely a very large number still available in storage (albeit of the un-upgraded Zu-23-2 variant). On top of this there are a great many exported to various countries around the world including Iran who have a domestically produced variant that already integrates radar tracking. (a direct export or licensed production source which would potentially greatly speed up the adoption and delivery of these upgrades although the link you provided shows what looks like a domestic Russian radar set so it's unlikely they're pursuing this option).   \n\n\nRussia also already has active production (although we don't know much about total capacity here) of their newer Zu-23-ZOM1 variant which includes remote fire and updated manpads integration. Scaling this production and upgrading the design is likely far more time efficient than any new equipment Russia might plan to develop to counter these newer threats.   \n\n\nRegardless I do agree with you about this not being the way forward however. The new threat posed by drones is going to require a multi-faceted approach with no single silver bullet, much less a AA gun from the 60s regardless of how many upgrades are bolted and duct-taped on. That being said it would be a welcome addition in the near term for frontline units that are struggling to track and engage smaller and medium sized drones. Even if they can't deliver very many of the upgraded versions, it would be a step at least in the right direction without putting too much pressure on other programs and suppliers.",
