Today the bonus offered by the city of Moscow has already reached... [2,245,000 Rubles](https://i.imgur.com/afqejXl.png).

Everything else I had written yesterday applies. Contracts are signable by any Russian citizen, with travel and lodging expenses needed to reach the city where the contract must be signed fully reimbursed. The poorer federal subjects, although they are gradually raising bonuses to adapt, cannot afford certain amounts at all and therefore their residents usually go to the richer regions/cities to sign contracts. For example, the contract signing bonus [offered by Khabarovsk Krai](https://i.imgur.com/ivemYyQ.png) is still only 595 thousand Rubles with no monthly addition to the salary, albeit it grants the right to some promotions as well as housing support.

If not, what are we doing here and what is the goal\". Instead the overall prevailing thought seems to be that if we just wait X more months some degree of support will enable Ukraine or Russia will just randomly break. But that seems like awful analysis to me. \n\nUkraine has no manpower, 1/5th the population of Russia, 100% reliant on foreign states for all equipment/intel needs, has not advanced anywhere in 10 months, and *still* somehow has no western fighter jets or adequate artillery (exactly like Finland in the Winter War).

It covers how Sudan got it's freedom , how thanks the nationalist movement being weak a lot of political actions where malleable and divorced from the majority of the people and how attempts to find solid ground floundered for example leaders in the South wanted actually to become apart of Egyptian union feeling otherwise they would be marginalised overtime and how the Southern independence movement came into being as well it's various incarnations survived the changing political like how the TPLF came into power nearly killed it. How the Islamist revolution ironically was both top/bottom lead with Sudan's secular Junta head who ended the first civil war tended to pivot to the right wing made the situation worse alienating compromising Southern figures as well giving Islamists groups more power over the government to the point a clique of Islamist bankers, tribal leaders as general population overthrew his rule leading Sudan's revolutionary government taking power. \n\n I would also   recommend  Revolutionary Sudan: Hasan Al-Turabi and the Islamist State, 1989-2000 for a understanding of Sudan's government began developing afterwards as well as it's foreign policy as Sudan while not now used to have a pretty impactful one. You can find both of these on libgen.\n\nThough on the situation in Darfur it's actually a very mixed place ethnically, a lot of the groups there actually are Arabs who say intermarried with non Arab people. The RSF are composed largely of Baggara Arabs though for the ''right'' Arab for them is a nomadic pastoralist one that tends to between Chad and elsewhere.\n\n The government in the 80s began supporting groups in Darfur to use to fight in the South, they did but also used their newfound equipment against rivals overtime  as conditions changed and things got worse in terms of resources and rebels spread into Darfur  the government and these groups to emphasis around how a ''real'' Muslim needs to be a Arab to justify oppressing and massacring the other people there.

The Root Causes of Sudan&#39;s Civil Wars: Old Wars and New Wars [Expanded 3rd Edition] (African Issues, 38). It covers how Sudan got it&#39;s freedom , how thanks the nationalist movement being weak a lot of political actions where malleable and divorced from the majority of the people and how attempts to find solid ground floundered for example leaders in the South wanted actually to become apart of Egyptian union feeling otherwise they would be marginalised overtime and how the Southern independence movement came into being as well it&#39;s various incarnations survived the changing political like how the TPLF came into power nearly killed it. How the Islamist revolution ironically was both top/bottom lead with Sudan&#39;s secular Junta head who ended the first civil war tended to pivot to the right wing made the situation worse alienating compromising Southern figures as well giving Islamists groups more power over the government to the point a clique of Islamist bankers, tribal leaders as general population overthrew his rule leading Sudan&#39;s revolutionary government taking power. </p>\n\n<p>I would also   recommend  Revolutionary Sudan: Hasan Al-Turabi and the Islamist State, 1989-2000 for a understanding of Sudan&#39;s government began developing afterwards as well as it&#39;s foreign policy as Sudan while not now used to have a pretty impactful one. You can find both of these on libgen.</p>\n\n<p>Though on the situation in Darfur it&#39;s actually a very mixed place ethnically, a lot of the groups there actually are Arabs who say intermarried with non Arab people. The RSF are composed largely of Baggara Arabs though for the &#39;&#39;right&#39;&#39; Arab for them is a nomadic pastoralist one that tends to between Chad and elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>The government in the 80s began supporting groups in Darfur to use to fight in the South, they did but also used their newfound equipment against rivals overtime  as conditions changed and things got worse in terms of resources and rebels spread into Darfur  the government and these groups to emphasis around how a &#39;&#39;real&#39;&#39; Muslim needs to be a Arab to justify oppressing and massacring the other people there.

None are thrilled about the presence of Russian mercenaries in Mali, Sudan or in Syria, but the opposition forces are frequently islamist-aligned (sometimes true with the Chechens as well), and so if this is true it could be argued that Ukrainian activity may sometimes be to the benefit of islamist groups while at the same time hurting Russia.  Do we have any insight into how this is looked upon?</p>\n</div>",

                "body": "Unfortunately, I don't have a proper answer to your questions, but based on what I remember from reporting by top tier analysts (Kofman, Lee, Musyka, RUSI, et al), most Russian \"elite\" pre-war formations were used to poor effect early in the conflict. \n\nKeep in mind the pre-war Russian military was a partial mobilization force, meaning that units were only partially manned at peace time, with the remainder of the unit filled by conscripts in time of war. Notably, those conscripts were supposed to make up a large part of more simple tasks like logistics, transportation, infantry, etc. But Russia invaded Ukriane at peacetime manning levels, so their units *started out* dangerously undermanned and lacking in infantry to begin with. It wasn't uncommon to see Russian BMPs bringing just 2 dismounts into battle, which, as you can imagine, wasn't very effective. \n\nRussian \"elite\" formations also acted as the tip of the spear in the early war, launching deep attacks into the Ukrainian rear in the North and East of the country. But they also weren't expecting much resistance, and suffered serious losses as a result (the video of Spetsnaz rolling into Kharkiv in Tigr IMVs in the first days of the war just to get bushwhacked comes to mind). Ukrainian artillery in particular devastated many Russian formations in the early days due to poor spacing and poor communications between different units. Also worth noting that the VDV in particular suffered serious losses due to being equipped with BMDs that had garbage armor and were super flammable. There's a reason why they're equipped more like regular mechanized formations these days. \n\nAfter the Russian \"good will gesture\" to pull out of the North and East, Russian manpower issues quickly became critical during the Summer. They made up for this lack of manpower by using their absolutely overwhelming fires advantage (the mismatch between Russian and Ukrainian fires peaked during this time period and has slowly moved closer to parity over time) and their elite formations (as well as disposable LDPR conscript infantry) to eke out what gains they could, suffering serious losses in the process. Notably, Spetsnaz units were being used as light infantry during this time period, which is a really good way to get effectively irreplaceable servicemen killed for minimal gains on maps. Despite serious losses in the first year of the war, something like 30,000 troops, mostly VDV, were able to hold back Ukrainian forces in Kherson until the end of 2022 and escaped back across the Dnipro mostly intact. \n\nMy understanding is that Russia lost much of, if not most of, its pre-war army since the invasion began. Their elite formations suffered serious losses early on, but have since been heavily reinforced with contract servicemen. As such force quality has dropped, but they're now more properly manned than they were at the start of the war and these formations are some of the best Russia has remainint, used to hold key terrain, act as \"firefighters\" going wherever fighting is the heaviest to prevent breakthroughs on defense and exploit Ukrainian weaknesses on offense, and launching assaults on key parts of the Ukrainian line. \n\nSo in some ways they're not nearly the fighting force they were pre-war and they are often using lower quality equipment than they were in early 2023, but they're also chock full of combat veterans and are fielding new capabilities too. Overall I think its something of a mixed bag, some units have performed exceptionally well all war, while others *cough* 1st Guards Tank Army *cough* have underperformed time and time again despite still fielding some of the best equipment Russia has to offer. It seems to me that the VDV have proven themselves the best fighting forces of the \"elite\" formations Russia has available to them, routinely performing exceptionally well, while the Naval Infantry and Guards mechanized and armored formations have largely underperformed.\n\nI think u/Larelli might have more helpful info for you though.",

It wasn&#39;t uncommon to see Russian BMPs bringing just 2 dismounts into battle, which, as you can imagine, wasn&#39;t very effective. </p>\n\n<p>Russian &quot;elite&quot; formations also acted as the tip of the spear in the early war, launching deep attacks into the Ukrainian rear in the North and East of the country. But they also weren&#39;t expecting much resistance, and suffered serious losses as a result (the video of Spetsnaz rolling into Kharkiv in Tigr IMVs in the first days of the war just to get bushwhacked comes to mind). Ukrainian artillery in particular devastated many Russian formations in the early days due to poor spacing and poor communications between different units. Also worth noting that the VDV in particular suffered serious losses due to being equipped with BMDs that had garbage armor and were super flammable. There&#39;s a reason why they&#39;re equipped more like regular mechanized formations these days. </p>\n\n<p>After the Russian &quot;good will gesture&quot; to pull out of the North and East, Russian manpower issues quickly became critical during the Summer. They made up for this lack of manpower by using their absolutely overwhelming fires advantage (the mismatch between Russian and Ukrainian fires peaked during this time period and has slowly moved closer to parity over time) and their elite formations (as well as disposable LDPR conscript infantry) to eke out what gains they could, suffering serious losses in the process. Notably, Spetsnaz units were being used as light infantry during this time period, which is a really good way to get effectively irreplaceable servicemen killed for minimal gains on maps. Despite serious losses in the first year of the war, something like 30,000 troops, mostly VDV, were able to hold back Ukrainian forces in Kherson until the end of 2022 and escaped back across the Dnipro mostly intact. </p>\n\n<p>My understanding is that Russia lost much of, if not most of, its pre-war army since the invasion began. Their elite formations suffered serious losses early on, but have since been heavily reinforced with contract servicemen. As such force quality has dropped, but they&#39;re now more properly manned than they were at the start of the war and these formations are some of the best Russia has remainint, used to hold key terrain, act as &quot;firefighters&quot; going wherever fighting is the heaviest to prevent breakthroughs on defense and exploit Ukrainian weaknesses on offense, and launching assaults on key parts of the Ukrainian line. </p>\n\n<p>So in some ways they&#39;re not nearly the fighting force they were pre-war and they are often using lower quality equipment than they were in early 2023, but they&#39;re also chock full of combat veterans and are fielding new capabilities too. Overall I think its something of a mixed bag, some units have performed exceptionally well all war, while others <em>cough</em> 1st Guards Tank Army <em>cough</em> have underperformed time and time again despite still fielding some of the best equipment Russia has to offer. It seems to me that the VDV have proven themselves the best fighting forces of the &quot;elite&quot; formations Russia has available to them, routinely performing exceptionally well, while the Naval Infantry and Guards mechanized and armored formations have largely underperformed.</p>\n\n<p>I think <a href=\"/u/Larelli\">u/Larelli</a> might have more helpful info for you though.</p>\n</div>",

Can someone translate the meaning of the name?

On 28 July, the Russian unit \u201cStalin\u2019s Falcons\u201d released a video showing a \u201cGerbera\u201d UAV developed by OKB Gastello. The drone is reported to be used for reconnaissance, utilized as a kamikaze drone, or as a decoy for air defense systems.*\n\n*Based on earlier photos from Kyiv region, the drone found on 24 July was missing its warhead, suggesting it was performing a reconnaissance or other non-combat role. The video footage indicates that the strike version of the \u201cGerbera\u201d uses a television camera for manual targeting, similar to those installed on FPV drones.*\n\n*The precision of the strike depends on the operator\u2019s skill, as evidenced by the propaganda video where the drone did not hit the target directly but exploded nearby.*\n\n*The drone\u2019s operational range with a warhead appears limited. However, it might also use another drone with a relay for guidance, similar to Russia\u2019s use of the \u201cLancet\u201d loitering munition. The downed or suppressed drone in the Kyiv region contained two 3/4G antennas and a modem with a SIM card, which could provide a more stable communication channel for transmitting video to the operator\u2019s control unit via the Ukrainian mobile network.*\n\nEdit:\n\nAlso Russia has announced production of a new drone.  A mini Baba Yaga.\n\n[Russia Announces Serial Production of MiS-35: What Kind of Weapon is This? | Defense Express | July 2024](https://en.defence-ua.com/industries/russia_announces_serial_production_of_mis_35_what_kind_of_weapon_is_this-11331.html)\n\n*The Russian defense industry has started mass production of one of its new developments, the MiS-35 strike-reconnaissance hexacopter, which the enemy positions as a \"mini 'Baba Yaga'\" (referring to the Ukrainian strike hexacopter).*\n\n*As reported by enemy propaganda media, it is designed to conduct both strike and reconnaissance missions.*\n\n*The MiS design bureau states, \"The device utilizes our developed guidance system, which ensures the drone's safe return to its point of departure even if communication with the operator is completely lost. This system relies on inertial navigation principles and operates independently of GPS, making it a valuable asset in enhancing drone performance in electronic warfare scenarios. The guidance system navigates the drone out of the electronic warfare area until communication with the operator is reestablished.\"*\n\n*\"The MiS-35 UAV is designed based on the hexacopter configuration, featuring six propeller-driven units and a foldable transportation system. It boasts a payload capacity of up to 4.5 kg, a maximum flight speed of 63 km/h, and a maximum flight time of 32 minutes when carrying a load. Additionally, the drone comes equipped with a cargo drop mechanism, an analog camera with six-fold zoom capability, a communication channel resistant to interference, and the option to install a thermal imager,\" the report added.*",

On 28 July, the Russian unit \u201cStalin\u2019s Falcons\u201d released a video showing a \u201cGerbera\u201d UAV developed by OKB Gastello. The drone is reported to be used for reconnaissance, utilized as a kamikaze drone, or as a decoy for air defense systems.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Based on earlier photos from Kyiv region, the drone found on 24 July was missing its warhead, suggesting it was performing a reconnaissance or other non-combat role. The video footage indicates that the strike version of the \u201cGerbera\u201d uses a television camera for manual targeting, similar to those installed on FPV drones.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The precision of the strike depends on the operator\u2019s skill, as evidenced by the propaganda video where the drone did not hit the target directly but exploded nearby.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The drone\u2019s operational range with a warhead appears limited. However, it might also use another drone with a relay for guidance, similar to Russia\u2019s use of the \u201cLancet\u201d loitering munition. The downed or suppressed drone in the Kyiv region contained two 3/4G antennas and a modem with a SIM card, which could provide a more stable communication channel for transmitting video to the operator\u2019s control unit via the Ukrainian mobile network.</em></p>\n\n<p>Edit:</p>\n\n<p>Also Russia has announced production of a new drone.  A mini Baba Yaga.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.defence-ua.com/industries/russia_announces_serial_production_of_mis_35_what_kind_of_weapon_is_this-11331.html\">Russia Announces Serial Production of MiS-35: What Kind of Weapon is This? | Defense Express | July 2024</a></p>\n\n<p><em>The Russian defense industry has started mass production of one of its new developments, the MiS-35 strike-reconnaissance hexacopter, which the enemy positions as a &quot;mini &#39;Baba Yaga&#39;&quot; (referring to the Ukrainian strike hexacopter).</em></p>\n\n<p><em>As reported by enemy propaganda media, it is designed to conduct both strike and reconnaissance missions.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>The MiS design bureau states, &quot;The device utilizes our developed guidance system, which ensures the drone&#39;s safe return to its point of departure even if communication with the operator is completely lost. This system relies on inertial navigation principles and operates independently of GPS, making it a valuable asset in enhancing drone performance in electronic warfare scenarios. The guidance system navigates the drone out of the electronic warfare area until communication with the operator is reestablished.&quot;</em></p>\n\n<p><em>&quot;The MiS-35 UAV is designed based on the hexacopter configuration, featuring six propeller-driven units and a foldable transportation system. It boasts a payload capacity of up to 4.5 kg, a maximum flight speed of 63 km/h, and a maximum flight time of 32 minutes when carrying a load. Additionally, the drone comes equipped with a cargo drop mechanism, an analog camera with six-fold zoom capability, a communication channel resistant to interference, and the option to install a thermal imager,&quot; the report added.</em></p>\n</div>",

They are also allied and arguably subservient to Mr Ayatollah over in Tehran- which likewise has ideological and strategic reasons to be hostile to Israel.\n\nAnother reason for the hostility is the gradually escalating domestic pressure to do something about Israel.
