It left a concern for the future: \"Ukraine's best chance is now\"\n\n An experienced military analyst went east to see the war with his own eyes.  It left him both hopeful and worried.  A Ukrainian counter-offensive has a real chance in the coming months, he assesses.  But the chance is short-lived and may not come again.\n\n Most military analysts observe war from a distance.\n\n So did Rob Lee, until he realized it wasn't enough.\n\n \"There is a lot that you cannot understand at all when you are sitting far away,\" he says in an interview with Berlingske.\n\n Therefore, a few months ago, the American military researcher took matters into his own hands.\n\n As part of a small delegation, he traveled east to the hottest part of the front, the town of Bakhmut, which Russian forces have been unsuccessfully trying to capture for more than eight months.\n\n He met Ukrainian soldiers whose positions were under relentless Russian fire.  And he heard reports of a shortage of ammunition to respond with.\n\n \"The area is admittedly not representative of the entire front line,\" says Rob Lee in a telephone interview.\n\n \"But it was rough for these people.  It was very rough,' he says of the soldiers in Bakhmut.\n\n He mentions it now because the situation there says something about what many are impatiently waiting for these weeks: Ukraine's long-announced counter-offensive.\n\n If you want to understand how decisive it will be, you have to realize how the scarcity of ammunition risks limiting Ukraine's options in the slightly longer term.\n\n \"Therefore, Ukraine's best chance is now,\" says Rob Lee.\n\n Winter War failed\n Rob Lee is himself a former Marine, now a senior researcher at the US Foreign Policy Research Institute.\n\n When the war broke out, he had studied Russian defense policy for a number of years.  Since then, he has analyzed the Russian invasion so closely that he has amassed over 600,000 followers on Twitter.\n\n Right now he is watching for signs that the offensive is starting.  Because in many ways the time is favorable for Ukraine:\n\n First, it is clear that Russia's winter offensive has failed.\n\n The Russian generals stand with minimal gains in exchange for catastrophic losses of soldiers at still untaken cities such as Vuhledar and Bakhmut.\n\n \"The offensive potential of the Russians is quite degraded.  Even if they take Bakhmut, we know that the Ukrainians are holding back resources for the offensive.  It is the one that will be decisive,' says Rob Lee.\n\n At the same time, Ukraine has spent the winter and spring building new units.\n\n For the first time, several brigades are made up predominantly of soldiers who have been trained to use Western weapons, from armor to artillery.\n\n \"This means that Ukraine has built up enough combat power for them to succeed.  They will be able to break through the Russian lines,\u201d predicts Rob Lee.\n\n The question is how far they can go.\n\nRivals behind Russian lines\n Rob Lee points to the hundreds of kilometers of minefields, trenches and artillery positions that the Russians have built along the current front line.\n\n \"We must not underestimate how difficult it is to cross minefields and defensive lines.  I think they will make progress, but I don't know how big that progress will be,' he says.\n\n One of the biggest unknowns in the equation is what the Russian generals have learned from their previous setbacks.\n\n In the autumn, the Russian lines collapsed outside Kharkiv in the north, and shortly afterwards the Russians had to make a humiliating retreat from the city of Kherson in the south.\n\n \"We know that they have built stronger defensive lines, but the decisive factor will be whether they are also able to make decisions in real time if Ukraine exploits their weak points,\" says Rob Lee.\n\n Unlike in the autumn, it is now the Russian defense chief, Valeriy Gerasimov, who is at the head of the invasion in Ukraine.\n\n But the Russians are struggling with internal rivalries and poor communication between the mercenaries of the Wagner group and the regular Russian troops.\n\n \"Much will depend on the ability of the Russian forces to coordinate between the various units in the south.  I wouldn't be surprised if they run into big problems here,' he says.\n\n The time is now\n Thus, the coming weeks and months may prove to be the Ukrainians' best chance to recapture occupied territories.  This is not least due to access to ammunition.\n\n The US has delivered around 1.5 million 155mm artillery shells to Ukraine, while EU countries have promised one million.  But the consumption is also enormous, just to maintain the current lines.\n\n Ukrainian politicians have previously said that the country's forces fire between 6,000 and 8,000 artillery shells a day, equivalent to almost a quarter of a million a month.\n\n The need during the offensive may be much greater, and already now the stocks in many western countries are running low.\n\n \"These deliveries will not continue at the same level later in the year.  Several countries have started new production, but we will not see results until 2024 and 2025,' says Rob Lee.\n\n Ukrainian top officials have also made no secret of the fact that in recent months they have been saving on grenades in order to build up a critical mass for the offensive.\n\n Also in the frontline town of Bakhmut.\n\n \"In February-March, forces were withheld and artillery shells were withheld, so the soldiers holding the positions were in a very difficult situation,\" says Rob Lee.\n\n It also means that the supply of ammunition is unlikely to be more advantageous for Ukraine than it is now.\n\n \"It is Ukraine's best chance to make significant progress in the near future as we look to 2024 and perhaps beyond.\"\n\n The bitter end\n Meanwhile, the advantage risks shifting to the Russian side, which is one of the reasons why Rob Lee sees minimal opportunities for a cease-fire and peace talks.\n\n \"Putin may even be pleasantly surprised that there have not been major domestic protests despite the catastrophic losses in the war,\" says Rob Lee.\n\n \"Putin will fight this war to the bitter end.  I don't see him negotiating.  He is convinced that he can endure the war longer than Ukraine and the West,' he says\n\n As a former soldier, meeting the Ukrainian front-line soldiers made an impression on him.\n\n \"When I was in Afghanistan, we had a time to return home.  We operated in a period of time whose extremes were known,' says Rob Lee:\n\n \"Many of these soldiers have been fighting since February 24, there is no end date in sight, and yet there was a tenacity that I have rarely seen.\"",

It was very rough,&#39; he says of the soldiers in Bakhmut.</p>\n\n<p>He mentions it now because the situation there says something about what many are impatiently waiting for these weeks: Ukraine&#39;s long-announced counter-offensive.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to understand how decisive it will be, you have to realize how the scarcity of ammunition risks limiting Ukraine&#39;s options in the slightly longer term.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Therefore, Ukraine&#39;s best chance is now,&quot; says Rob Lee.</p>\n\n<p>Winter War failed\n Rob Lee is himself a former Marine, now a senior researcher at the US Foreign Policy Research Institute.</p>\n\n<p>When the war broke out, he had studied Russian defense policy for a number of years.  Since then, he has analyzed the Russian invasion so closely that he has amassed over 600,000 followers on Twitter.</p>\n\n<p>Right now he is watching for signs that the offensive is starting.  Because in many ways the time is favorable for Ukraine:</p>\n\n<p>First, it is clear that Russia&#39;s winter offensive has failed.</p>\n\n<p>The Russian generals stand with minimal gains in exchange for catastrophic losses of soldiers at still untaken cities such as Vuhledar and Bakhmut.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;The offensive potential of the Russians is quite degraded.  Even if they take Bakhmut, we know that the Ukrainians are holding back resources for the offensive.  It is the one that will be decisive,&#39; says Rob Lee.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, Ukraine has spent the winter and spring building new units.</p>\n\n<p>For the first time, several brigades are made up predominantly of soldiers who have been trained to use Western weapons, from armor to artillery.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;This means that Ukraine has built up enough combat power for them to succeed.  They will be able to break through the Russian lines,\u201d predicts Rob Lee.</p>\n\n<p>The question is how far they can go.</p>\n\n<p>Rivals behind Russian lines\n Rob Lee points to the hundreds of kilometers of minefields, trenches and artillery positions that the Russians have built along the current front line.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We must not underestimate how difficult it is to cross minefields and defensive lines.  I think they will make progress, but I don&#39;t know how big that progress will be,&#39; he says.</p>\n\n<p>One of the biggest unknowns in the equation is what the Russian generals have learned from their previous setbacks.</p>\n\n<p>In the autumn, the Russian lines collapsed outside Kharkiv in the north, and shortly afterwards the Russians had to make a humiliating retreat from the city of Kherson in the south.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We know that they have built stronger defensive lines, but the decisive factor will be whether they are also able to make decisions in real time if Ukraine exploits their weak points,&quot; says Rob Lee.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike in the autumn, it is now the Russian defense chief, Valeriy Gerasimov, who is at the head of the invasion in Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>But the Russians are struggling with internal rivalries and poor communication between the mercenaries of the Wagner group and the regular Russian troops.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Much will depend on the ability of the Russian forces to coordinate between the various units in the south.  I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they run into big problems here,&#39; he says.</p>\n\n<p>The time is now\n Thus, the coming weeks and months may prove to be the Ukrainians&#39; best chance to recapture occupied territories.  This is not least due to access to ammunition.</p>\n\n<p>The US has delivered around 1.5 million 155mm artillery shells to Ukraine, while EU countries have promised one million.  But the consumption is also enormous, just to maintain the current lines.</p>\n\n<p>Ukrainian politicians have previously said that the country&#39;s forces fire between 6,000 and 8,000 artillery shells a day, equivalent to almost a quarter of a million a month.</p>\n\n<p>The need during the offensive may be much greater, and already now the stocks in many western countries are running low.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;These deliveries will not continue at the same level later in the year.  Several countries have started new production, but we will not see results until 2024 and 2025,&#39; says Rob Lee.</p>\n\n<p>Ukrainian top officials have also made no secret of the fact that in recent months they have been saving on grenades in order to build up a critical mass for the offensive.</p>\n\n<p>Also in the frontline town of Bakhmut.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;In February-March, forces were withheld and artillery shells were withheld, so the soldiers holding the positions were in a very difficult situation,&quot; says Rob Lee.</p>\n\n<p>It also means that the supply of ammunition is unlikely to be more advantageous for Ukraine than it is now.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;It is Ukraine&#39;s best chance to make significant progress in the near future as we look to 2024 and perhaps beyond.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The bitter end\n Meanwhile, the advantage risks shifting to the Russian side, which is one of the reasons why Rob Lee sees minimal opportunities for a cease-fire and peace talks.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Putin may even be pleasantly surprised that there have not been major domestic protests despite the catastrophic losses in the war,&quot; says Rob Lee.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Putin will fight this war to the bitter end.  I don&#39;t see him negotiating.  He is convinced that he can endure the war longer than Ukraine and the West,&#39; he says</p>\n\n<p>As a former soldier, meeting the Ukrainian front-line soldiers made an impression on him.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;When I was in Afghanistan, we had a time to return home.  We operated in a period of time whose extremes were known,&#39; says Rob Lee:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Many of these soldiers have been fighting since February 24, there is no end date in sight, and yet there was a tenacity that I have rarely seen.&quot;</p>\n</div>",

Since the invasion, thousands of anti-Kremlin activists, journalists and other professionals have left the country. Many others, including lawyers, have been arrested and prosecuted. But some have stayed and continued their work despite the risks.\n\nMore than 6,500 Russians have been penalized for \u201cdiscrediting\u201d the Russian Army since the law was passed by the Russian Parliament eight days after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, the lawyers said. People found to have broken the law are fined first, but being convicted of a repeat offense within a year can result in up to five years in prison.\n\nLast month, the Russian authorities arrested a Wall Street Journal reporter, Evan Gershkovich, and charged him with espionage, in what U.S. officials say appears to signal an even more severe Kremlin crackdown. The United States has designated Mr. Gershkovich as wrongfully detained, meaning he is seen as the equivalent of a political hostage.\n\nThe complaint filed on Tuesday was made on behalf of more than 20 Russians who were fined for criticizing the invasion. One of them, Maksim Filippov, was fined $650 for holding a poster in central Moscow that said, \u201cGive peace a chance.\u201d Others were fined for holding posters saying, \u201cPacifism is not a crime,\u201d and for antiwar activities, including likes or reposts of other content on social media, and even in private conversations or messages.\n\nThe lawyers have already exhausted all other legal means to repeal the legislation and hope that the filing will at least draw attention to the issue. In their complaint, the lawyers argue that the law violates constitutional rights of freedom of speech and assembly and that it also discriminates against critics of the war.\n\nThe court must respond to the filing, which typically takes several months, though it could also issue an outright dismissal.\n\nThe lawyers say they also plan to file similar complaints over other measures imposed by the Kremlin after the invasion, including the criminalization of spreading what the law calls \u201cfake news\u201d about the conflict.\n\n\u201cI want people who have been prosecuted for their antiwar position in Russia to know that they are not alone, and we are ready to fight for their rights,\u201d said Ms. Fitsner, 27. \u201cDespite all the repression and intimidation from the state.\u201d\n\nIn January, more than 200 Russian doctors signed a letter petitioning the Kremlin to provide medical support to Aleksei A. Navalny, a prominent critic of President Vladimir V. Putin. More than 50 Russian municipal and local lawmakers signed a similar letter, as well as more than 100 lawyers.

Also Greece only owns the S-300s specifically because that was how they resolved the Cypriot S-300 crisis, so they never stockpiled missiles the way a country for whom the S-300 systems form an integral part of their national air defense like Egypt would.\n\nThat said, the Egyptian deal is somewhat more recent and it's not clear to me from open source data how many batteries Egypt actually has received, nor if they have received everything they have paid for (and would therefore be willing to burn Russia, although the artillery deal makes that seem more probable). Most of the articles I've seen imply they've ordered at least a single Antey-2500 battery which has been delivered, and potentially there have been subsequent orders. The quoted $1bn purchase price seems excessive for a single system, though. The S-300VM/Antey-2500 by default only comes with two launchers and two reloaders carrying a total of 44 missiles. And at most would have six launchers capable of launching 60 missiles with six reloaders carrying 72 missiles. Plus however many reloads they might want to keep in storage. But overall it likely would not be dramatically different from the numbers the Greeks have, but perhaps with the promise of a less politically charged and complicated context around their acquisition.",
