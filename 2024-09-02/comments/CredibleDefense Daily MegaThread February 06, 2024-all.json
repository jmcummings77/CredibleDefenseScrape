Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

These included:\n\n>The lack of Infantry Fighting Vehicle once Warrior is replaced by Boxer (which is an Armoured Personnel Carrier);\n\n>The lack of funding for new and upgraded systems with resources only available to procure 1,016 Boxer APCs out of a requirement for 1,305 and 61 Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS) of a requirement for 75, plus only eight recovery vehicles out of a requirement for 10;\n    \n>The reduction in the fleet of Challenger tanks as they are upgraded to Challenger 3s and ammunition shortages for the Challenger 2\u2019s 120mm rifled main gun;\n    \n>The delay in the delivery of the Ajax Armoured Fighting Vehicle;\n    \n\n>The readiness of the AS-90 self-propelled artillery fleet which has been reduced by the (necessary) donation of 30 vehicles to Ukraine. The announcement that the UK will purchase 14 Archer artillery systems is not a full recapitalisation;\n    \n>Inadequate domestic air and missile defence capabilities. The British Army holds responsibility for the majority of UK ground-based surface-to-air missile unit but only one medium-range and one short-range SAM regular regiments, plus one short-range Army Reserve regiment, are in existence. Ballistic missile defences are absent. Electromagnetic and laser defence systems are largely still in development;\n    \n>The bottleneck in procurement and delivery of the replacements for the roughly 6,000 NLAW anti-tank systems and 155mm artillery ammunition which have been vital in the Ukrainian Armed Forces fight against Russia. Replacements will only begin to be delivered at scale during 2024;\n    \n>An absence of regular Army close support artillery, engineering, REME and logistics support within the 4th Light Brigade Combat Team, with only Army Reserve units in these roles attached. This leaves the brigade unusable at short notice;\n    \n>A lack of air transport (chiefly sourced from the RAF) to support the \u2018Persistent Engagement\u2019 strategy.74 The forward deployment of Special Forces, elements of the Army Special Operations Brigade and Security Forces Assistance Brigade will require extensive fixed and rotary winged air transport support. This lack of air transport capacity appears to have led the MoD to outsource parachute training to the private sector, with a contract opportunity of up to eight years running from Q1 2025 having been recently published;\n    \n>3 Commando Brigade, historically the lead UK northern flank land formation, is no longer able to deploy at brigade strength. The Army has made some advances in this area but more can still be done to ensure an adequate capacity to operate in this increasingly important region. The MoD\u2019s 2022 Arctic defence strategy document, The UK\u2019s Defence Contribution in the High North, outlines current departmental efforts but is short on quantifiable specifics.75\n\nConcerning the Royal Navy:\n\n>Dr Rowan Allport of the Human Security Centre produced a detailed list of what he perceived to be Royal Navy readiness gaps and capability shortfalls which included:\n\n>Delays to the Type 26 frigate programme which have resulted in the Type 23 frigate force being run on far past its expected lifespan, meaning sustainment of the platform had become increasingly difficult and expensive.\n \n>The reliance on RFA Fort Victoria as the only RFA solid stores ship is compounded by the fact that it is at reduced readiness due to personnel shortages. The replacement Fleet Solid Support Ships are (currently) due to enter service from 2028 onwards\u2014meaning that RFA Fort Victoria will more than likely be required for the Carrier Strike Group deployment when it travels to the Indo-Pacific in 2025.\n\n>The availability of SSNs has dropped as a result of delays in the Astute-class attack submarine building programme. Even once all seven Astutes are in service, it is questionable whether the force will be able to sustain their current tasks and the additional deployments to Australia and wider region from 2026 onwards.\n\n>Delays to the Power Improvement Project (PIP) upgrade on the Type 45s to replace the two existing diesel generators with three more powerful models have impacted availability of the vessels.\n\n>The Littoral Response Group (South), which will operate in the Indo-Pacific, will be led by RFA Argus\u2014the ship \u201cis now 42 years old and will inevitably be increasingly prone to mechanical and other issues as time passes\u201d.\n\n>The Royal Navy\u2019s Merlin HM2 fleet has only 30 aircraft but is over-tasked, responsible for both most Navy airborne anti-submarine warfare missions92 and Airborne Surveillance and Control taskings.93\n \n>Both the Type 31 frigate94 and the Type 2695 will receive the Mk.41 vertical launching system but will therefore require significant additional procurement of munitions for their utility to be fully realised.\n \n>Delays to the Dreadnought-class ballistic missile submarine programme have resulted in the Vanguard-class having to continue in service beyond their design life. While the material state of the vessels is publicly unknown, there are reasons to believe they will require additional servicing and maintenance as they significantly exceed their lifespan.96\n \n>The reduction in numbers of Royal Marines and the move \u201ctowards a forward-based littoral model utilising small units supported by advanced technology\u201d97 raises questions about their resilience in hostile environments.98\n\nAnd concerning the Royal Air Force:\n\n>A shortfall in combat aircraft numbers. The retirement of 30 Tranche 1 Typhoon aircraft in 2025 (with the majority of their airframe lives remaining) will leave only 107 Typhoons in service. 48 F-35B aircraft should be delivered by the end of 2025,115 but these will be jointly operated by the Royal Navy and will have a commitment to carrier operations.\n\n>There is also a shortfall in fixed-wing transport aircraft numbers and capabilities caused by the retirement of the C-130J Hercules116 with plans to procure greater numbers of the A400M judged by the National Audit Office to be unaffordable.\n \n>Delays in the procurement of 14 new model Chinook helicopters with extended ranges have occurred due to budget shortfalls. The new Chinooks are intended to replace older model Chinooks but the new model\u2019s increased range could help cover some tasks previously assigned to the C-130J fleet and in supporting the Persistent Engagement strategy.\n\n>There has been a lack of a dedicated Suppression of Enemy Air Defence/Destruction of Enemy Air Defence (SEAD/DEAD) capability since the RAF retired the Air-Launched Anti-Radiation Missile (ALARM) in 2013. The planned introduction by the UK of the SPEAR 3 missile with a multi-mode seeker and a range of around 80 miles could\u2014particularly if used in conjunction with the F-35B\u2019s electronic warfare system\u2014provide a new SEAD/DEAD capability.\n    \n>Failures in the pilot training system have led to shortfalls in pilot numbers.\n \n>There are insufficient numbers of Maritime Patrol Aircraft and Wedgetail AEW1 airborne early warning and control aircraft.\n  \n>There is a lack of air-to-air refuelling capacity for the Poseidon MRA1, Wedgetail AEW1, RC-135W Rivet Joint and C-17 Globemaster aircraft as they all lack an in-flight refuelling probe to make them compatible with the RAF Voyager tanker fleet.117\n>The RAF does not have kinetic ground-based air defence systems or an anti-ballistic missile capability.118",

The EU also tries to play a role, with joint purchase of ammunition (whatever one thinks of it, the end goal of the EU is to become a new state). More integration through NATO is also taking place.

Additionally, this person said, the base, known as Tower 22, was not outfitted with weapons that can \"kill\" aerial threats like drones, and instead relied on electronic warfare systems designed to disable them or disrupt their path to a target.\n\n>A common strategy among drone operators and other pilots seeking to minimize or evade radar detection is to fly low to the ground.

Both officials, like some others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive and ongoing investigation. Defense officials have stressed that assessments can change as investigators learn more.\n\n> Although Tower 22 was outfitted with \"multiple\" electronic warfare systems capable of taking drones offline, it had limited means to protect itself. The defense official with direct knowledge of the military's early assessment said the outpost was deemed a relatively low-threat environment. \"This was based on the vast majority of the threats and 99 percent of the [Iranian-proxy] attacks being against facilities in Iraq and Syria,\" the official told The Post.\n\n>The base's defensive posture has changed in the attack's aftermath, the official said, but declined to elaborate.\n\n>\"We are not waiting for the investigation to be complete to implement changes from lessons learned in the tragic attack on Tower 22,\" the official said.",

Additionally, this person said, the base, known as Tower 22, was not outfitted with weapons that can &quot;kill&quot; aerial threats like drones, and instead relied on electronic warfare systems designed to disable them or disrupt their path to a target.</p>\n\n<p>A common strategy among drone operators and other pilots seeking to minimize or evade radar detection is to fly low to the ground. Another U.S. official affirmed the military&#39;s belief that the drone flew too low to be detected. Both officials, like some others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive and ongoing investigation. Defense officials have stressed that assessments can change as investigators learn more.</p>\n\n<p>Although Tower 22 was outfitted with &quot;multiple&quot; electronic warfare systems capable of taking drones offline, it had limited means to protect itself. The defense official with direct knowledge of the military&#39;s early assessment said the outpost was deemed a relatively low-threat environment. &quot;This was based on the vast majority of the threats and 99 percent of the [Iranian-proxy] attacks being against facilities in Iraq and Syria,&quot; the official told The Post.</p>\n\n<p>The base&#39;s defensive posture has changed in the attack&#39;s aftermath, the official said, but declined to elaborate.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;We are not waiting for the investigation to be complete to implement changes from lessons learned in the tragic attack on Tower 22,&quot; the official said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

            "body": ">What systems are playing the largest role in creating this outcome\n\nIntelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) drones are a staple of this war. They are a mix of 1) top end military grade versions, that often fly at high altitude, have long range/loiter time, top notch cameras including thermal/FLIR, laser designators, GPS capable so they can know where they are and can pull grids from what they can lase, with secure comms that are \"hardened\" against electronic warfare, 2) Commercial drones that are cheap and more plentiful, but more easily jammed, limited in range, usually mid to poor cameras, etc.  \n\nThe better capable military grade drones can also do Intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance (ISTAR), which specifically relates to being tied into specific precision guided munitions, like laser guided munitions, or getting accurate grids for GPS guided munitions. \n\nThe drone feeds are displayed in the tactical level HQs at ever level from at least battalion and especially brigade for the UAF and regiment and division with the Russians. Think a large room filled with tables that have laptops all over and flat screen TVs and computer monitors all over the walls, some with digital maps tied to networked C4I systems (the UA or RU versions of [Blue Force Tracker](https://media.defense.gov/2008/Jan/12/2000413867/-1/-1/0/080109-F-0000K-001.JPG)), with most of them displaying live drone feed provided direct from the drone operators located elsewhere. There, tactical commanders are using the drone feed, some watching their own territory, some directly monitoring the forward line of enemy troops, some in the enemy's tactical rear areas especially known supply lines, known or suspected assembly areas, looking for artillery, looking for HQs, etc. With some of the better drones especially able to see quite far back, up to 20 km or even more (Russian drones supposedly have much longer range into the UAF tactical and operational rear areas using drones). \n\nWhen they spot a target, the unit commander or duty officer with staff are immediately able to vector in accurate and very responsive fires. That ranges from satellite guided GMLRS, extended range precision tube artillery, satellite guided glide bombs (likely isn't very responsive), dumb MLRS tube arty or mortars, quadcopter munition dropping drones, and FPV drones\\*. Extremely short kill chains are possible. \n\nThe Russians and Ukrainians call that Reconnaissance Fires Complex. \n\nSo what is happening is, because the attacking side for whatever reason can't deny the enemy the ability to see with drones, when they conduct company sized armor attacks they are spotted at some point either gathering at the assembly area (can be up to \\~10-15 km from the front lines), during the approach march, during the breaching attempt, during the attack, during the consolidation phase following a successful attack. \n\nThe ways they might be able to negate ISR/ISTAR drones in their rear is through EW, obscuration (smoke or operating at night), and/or Counter-Unmanned Aerial Systems (C-UAS), which is air defenses specifically meant to counter flying drones. \n\nBecause armored vehicles are hard to hide a company or more of them, and because they are most often moving in column formation along known routes that are usually patrolled by drones, because there are limited avenues of approach to reach friendly targets, because they're big, with bright heat signatures, moving around a lot, belching smoke, etc, they are easy to spot by drones when they are airborne. \n\nIf they are spotted, they can be targeted by something, and there is a good chance it'll be accurate because there are a plethora of guided weapons and because the lines are so static the indirect fire is pretty accurate too.  If nothing else, real time info is spread out to the defending units (\"Enemy forces crossing check point 4 heading to your position, now at 550 meters, get ready to use your ATGMs.\" or something to that effect. \n\nSmall unit mechanized attacks (1-4 tanks or IFV) can be more successful hidden as they can be infiltrated forward at night and hidden in treelines or other hide sites, and then launched for short range attacks that have a good chance of not being observed instantly by enemy drones, and potentially retreating and returning to their hide site before they can be engaged. \n\nSmall unit (platoon or smaller) dismounted infantry-engineer attacks can be launched from very close to the front lines (short jump off), they have greater option for routes because they are not as constrained by terrain (requiring more drones overwatching random areas to catch them), they are smaller targets that more easily blend in with their surrounding areas (harder to see them), they have smaller heat signatures (harder to see them), they can more easily attack at night (harder to see them), etc. If they are spotted, they're usually screwed when engaged by fires. \n\n \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>and how many of them are only available to Ukraine via western aid?\n\nUkraine already has them. They are very very good at Recon Fires Complex, it's their strong suit. Same with Russia, both sides are really good at RFC, but suck at most other things, and have no way to counter RFC that works for them (likely because to deny RFC to the enemy means denying it to themselves). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>but are these drones heavy enough to do significant damage to armor as to deter a massed assault\n\nThey've worked so far. The average FPV drone uses a 93mm RPG round, sufficient to destroy a tank if it hits something not covered by explosive reactive armor or cage armor. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>or is the actual factor limiting these assaults something else such as the organizational capabilities of the Russian military?\n\nVery much organization capabilities limiting success. A mechanized combined arms breach and assault, that is a company sized force or larger getting through minefields and other obstacles to successfully overrun a prepared, alert defensive position, is an extremely complex mission, one of the hardest. Its like an orchestra, not only do all the musicians need to know how to play their own instruments, they need to know how to play together perfectly or it sounds like shit. The Russians are a very bad orchestra. \n\nAdditionally, the Russians and Ukrainians both have no way of denying observation to the drones. There are techniques, but either they screw them up (like the few attempts they've tried to lay smoke screens), or can't do them large enough because they have technical limitations or are worried about fratricide (mostly relating to electronic warfare). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*FPV drones is the nickname for commercial type kamikaze strike drones, but it should also describe dedicated military grade types like Lancets or Switchblades, as they do the exact same thing.",

Within the last year, the Russians haven't moved that far, it took them basically a year to go from [this a year ago](https://militaryland.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/day_344_Avdiivka-Front.jpg) to what is currently happening. Assuming the Ukrainians have fall back defenders, even hasty, it'll be a tough, slow, and costly advance for the Russians to make it another kilometer west, etc. \n\n>In your opinion/speculation, is that what's Kofman is doing now?\n\nHe and a few other analysts mentioned in the counteroffensive after action episode of his podcast that they have to be very careful how they discuss the war openly due to issues related to feedback. Apparently there is a large group of them that are on a WhatsApp group together and that's the only place they're actually candid. Even when they mention talking points that are very popular inside Ukraine especially inside the UAF (like the defense of Bakhmut), those are much more taboo over here than over there because the Thought Police are ready to pounce on anyone too pessimistic. Kofman and Rob Lee took a lot of abuse and they weren't saying anything that half a million Ukrainian troops probably weren't saying either. But if they go too far they very well can destroy their careers, and Kofman mentioned that too. \n\nI do envy their access to get info and the real scoop. I'd LOVE to go on fact finding trips to the front line and then write about them. But nobody is going to ask me or want me to go, guys like Kofman and others get access to top officials, generals, touring brigade TOCs at the front lines, are given guides and interpreters not because the Ukrainians are generous but because they help them get foreign support. They know that, so they have to toe the line to keep that access going, which means as long as this war is active they can't go overboard.\n\nAfter the war, it'll probably be a different story. I can see lots of them writing some decent books or at least contributing to some with decent revelations that will need to suffice until enough time passes for the actual players involved, the military men and govt officials on all sides, to talk, show their papers, open their archives, etc. But I doubt I'll be alive by the time that happens.",

I don&#39;t know how many might cross the line to do it, but there&#39;s plenty not running for reelection next year that could be targeted. </p>\n\n<p>I think the only somewhat face saving way for the Republicans is to attach it to the May 8th budget. It gives enough cover to Republican hawks and takes care of the necessary items for the year so if Johnson gets hit with a Motion to Vacate, it doesn&#39;t threaten anything until next year.</p>\n</div>",

Avdiivka has been a poor tactical position that it warranted a retreat for some time. I'm not saying the whole salient needed to be evacuated, but there is no point in holding onto the city anymore, not if they can fall back to straighter, shorter, more secure lines, freeing up forces to go into the reserve, etc. \n\nTheir failure to do that already, or to reinforce the units already there is indicative of a half ass approach that's defined the war effort. They want to hold at all costs because if they lose it, then it's bad political optics. But they still won't commit what's necessary to do that, because either they don't have it or it'll be a bad call just to hold a city of no real value. As they no doubt bicker about what to do, they only commit the bare minimum to stave off short term catastrophe, while still hemorrhaging manpower equipment and supplies they can't afford to lose.\n\nAre they attriting the Russians? Yes. So what? In most of those battles, Ukraine has to take losses we know they can't sustain in order to cause heavier losses to Russia in the hope, without proof, that maybe somehow they can't sustain them either. That's a high risk gamble that has no reason it'll work. \n\nBut at Avdiivka, they hold. Same with other places. Still sending UAF Marines and TDF across the Dnieper as bait to draw the Russians to attack Krynky. Etc. That's business as usual for Ukraine unfortunately but it's the opposite of what many called for in 2024, going on the strategic defensive, or active defense. \n\nThat means economy of force everywhere possible. It means Ukraine picking and choosing fights only where it really suits them, it means keeping as much of the force in reserve as possible to build up size and quality, while those on the line should be rotated in and out often and fight from well built fixed defensive positions with secure supply lines. Use as little ammo as possible to stockpile for the future, with the occasional limited scale raids and attacks where they have a tactical advantage to start, otherwise waiting until 2025 to go on the offensive, when hopefully the US/EU arty production maxes out and they'll potentially be able to fire 9k shells per day without going in the hole.\n\nThat's not just Good Idea Fairy plans at this point, doing that is literally the only strategy that'll allow them to even survive 2024, but I'm not seeing proof it's being followed. \n\nMore so, they still haven't addressed their mobilization problems.  Despite saying in mid November that he wanted a solution in a week, now in February Zelensky is still deliberately kicking the can down the road to avoid making a decision. \n\nSo right now, I'm pretty depressed about Ukrainian chances. The only positive i have is maybe when GLSDB being fielded shortly might have a major effects to halt the current Russian offensive, but that's likely not going to be the case. It'll have positive effects, but not enough to really charge anything.",

The existing stockpiles of the US and most of the EU are dangerously low already. So it means someone else giving.

Chinese invasion is finally happening and you&#39;re about to fire ATACMS to the mainland, then suddenly you receive a call from the Americans telling you to don&#39;t fire it at the mainland because that&#39;s an escalation.</p>\n</div>",

Today they're firing about 2,000 and even that level of rationing might be unsustainable. The Ukrainians should have ended their offensive months before they did, but even if it was say 6 weeks earlier, that would be more than 200k extra shells if we use the low end figure of 5k/day. 200k extra rounds would go a long way on the defensive, much further than they did on the offensive. \n\n>The attempted offensive was not multi-million shells endeavor, nor did it lose Ukrainians hundreds of thousands of men\n\nCorrect, because they didn't have those resources to lose. They did however expend somewhere around 1 million rounds and lost much of their infantry, especially their skilled assault infantry. Those losses aren't going to be easy to replace, and as far as ammunition goes, without US support Ukraine is going to be desperate for ammunition for many months to come since the Europeans were so absurdly slow in ramping up production despite the fact that their stockpiles were practically empty when the war began. \n\n>As for major losses, Russians tried massive Avdivka armored offensive (on the city that had been already in semi cauldron for more than a year at that time) on 4th of October (I think?).

Not sure if it is \"major losses\".  \n\nThe biggest thrust of the battle came at the beginning, when Ukraine still did have a small amount of manpower and ammunition to spare. The recent advances are specifically due to Ukraine's lack of both and are likely to continue since Ukraine is only going to be increasingly short of both in the coming months.

If they use them at A to do B, then they can&#39;t use them at X to do Y. </p>\n\n<p>Maybe if they&#39;d have halted the Orikhiv axis thrust then they could have massed units and supplies to push back the flanks at Avdiivka. Because that was an option too. Those flanks have only been there since last spring, there was no reason the Ukrainians couldn&#39;t try to push them back to the original JFO line except they didn&#39;t have the manpower, equipment and supplies, because they were being elsewhere.</p>\n</div>",
