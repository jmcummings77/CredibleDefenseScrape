As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

It's basically a hedge against Iran.\n\nIt's really just basic geopolitics, US stopping aid to Israel essentially gives more leeway to Iran and also leads to less US influence in the region. The cost of established base of operations(present Israel) is just trivial compared to a situation where the balance of power is against your interests and you have to fund guerillas, proxies, etc. to try to get control back. \n\nPeople then sometimes counter why Taiwan for example doesn't get same level of funding, but the balance is completely different. Israel is powerful enough to actually keep Iran down by itself; you could also argue it has more regional influence than Iran. Taiwan on the other hand is at best a nuisance for China that only serves as an ideological issue for the CCP. So from this perspective, if you wanted Taiwan to have a similar role to Israel you'd have to literally send hundreds of billions of dollars of aid; and that would just trigger a war; so the calculus is terrible. Supporting Israel on the other hand is very safe/easy, there is close to no blowback(aside from having some influence on domestic politics).\n\nSame goes for Ukraine, Ukraine is more like Taiwan than it is Israel for US interests. If it folds, it's bad but it's just a setback; it doesn't change the fundamentals much. That's why in relative terms Ukraine actually gets very little aid in comparison to Israel; when you compare the needs of the country, its population size, its level of conflict, etc. \n\nAll these other arguments in the thread seem to completely miss the point, the \"Israel lobby\", the ideological foundations of US support for Israel, etc. all of that is a top layer reason for support; those things are in place because of the fundamentals, and while they definitely enhance the support they are not the fundamental reason for that support.",

The USAF gets F15s  with better electronics, USN F18s, a better bomb dubbed the 'stormbreaker\" & Bahrain is about to get an F16 with a significant upgrade in capabilities.  \n\n[Air Force to get F-15E jet with fresh electronic warfare tech in summer | Defense News | April 2024](https://www.defensenews.com/air/2024/04/12/air-force-to-get-f-15e-jet-with-fresh-electronic-warfare-tech-in-summer/)  \n\n*The U.S. Air Force expects to receive its first operational F-15E Strike Eagle upgraded with an advanced electronic warfare system this summer. In a statement to Defense News on Thursday, Air Force spokesperson Maj. Alli Stormer said eight Boeing-made F-15E jets are undergoing modifications with the Eagle Passive Active Warning Survivability System, or EPAWSS. The work is taking place at the company\u2019s facility in San Antonio, Texas, the service said.*\n\n*EPAWSS will come standard on F-15EX Eagle II fighters, also made by Boeing, and will be added to some F-15Es. BAE Systems, which makes EPAWSS, said the technology will allow those F-15s to monitor, jam and deceive threats in highly contested environments as well as provide radar warning, geolocation, situational awareness and self-defense capabilities with an array of sensors, electronic countermeasures and algorithms.*\n\n*The delivery of the first F-15Es with upgraded electronic warfare capabilities would mark a major step forward in the Air Force\u2019s effort to modernize these fourth-generation aircraft and prepare them for a possible war against an advanced adversary, such as China.*\n\n*Boeing started installing the EPAWSS on operational F-15Es in San Antonio in July 2022, the Air Force said in a previous statement that year. Boeing also awarded BAE a contract in September 2022 to produce the second EPAWSS lot for new F-15EXs and as many as 43 F-15Es there were already operational. The Air Force now has roughly 218 F-15E jets.*\n\n*The Air Force also said EPAWSS\u2019 engineering and manufacturing development phase is nearly finished, and the service expects to have final production-representative hardware modules delivered this fiscal year. The Air Force expects to award a contract for full-rate production on EPAWSS by the end of 2024.*\n\n[U.S. Navy to Deploy SDB-II Smart Weapon Aboard F/A-18 Aircraft | Naval News | April 2024](https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2024/04/u-s-navy-to-deploy-sdb-ii-smart-weapon-aboard-f-a-18-aircraft/)\n\n*The F/A-18E/F is the Navy\u2019s first platform to carry the SDB-II, giving the aircraft the capability to hit moving targets in harsh weather and address targets in dynamic scenarios.*\n\n*\u201cThe Navy and Air Force team, along with the test community and fleet stakeholders, worked relentlessly to expedite the fielding of this weapon,\u201d said Tyler Alt, Navy SDB-II program manager. \u201cThis weapon will give our warfighters a much-needed capability and provide the basis for future network enabled weapons.\u201d*\n\n*SDB-II, or Ground Bomb Unit-53B (GBU-53B) \u201cStormBreaker,\u201d is an air-launched, precision-strike standoff weapon that enables the warfighter to defeat moving and fixed targets. It can operate in adverse weather conditions through its tri-mode seeker that employs infrared and millimeter wave radar to see through fog, smoke and rain.*\n\n*The weapon has the capability to receive updated target coordinates mid-flight via two-way datalink communications. Using these network options, SDB-II allows airborne or ground controllers the ability to send in-flight target updates.*\n\n*SDB-II is a Joint-Interest, Air Force-led program and is fielded on the Air Force\u2019s F-15E aircraft. SDB-II will also be compatible and fielded on F-16C/D and F-35 aircraft.*\n\n[Our First Look At An Armed-Up Block 70 F-16 Viper | The Warzone | April 2024](https://www.twz.com/air/our-first-look-at-an-armed-up-block-70-f-16-viper)\n\n*A little over a month after some of the first Block 70 F-16C/D Viper fighters left the United States for their new home in Bahrain, we now have our first look at how these jets might look when armed up for an actual combat mission. The Royal Bahrani Air Force is the first operator of Block 70 Vipers and two of its jets are at Edwards Air Force Base in California where U.S. Air Force pilots have been flying them as part of an ongoing testing and evaluation work. This is a routine part of the U.S. Foreign Military Sales process.*\n\n*In the pictures, the Bahraini Block 70 Viper is seen loaded with a pair of AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) on its wing tips, as well as an AIM-9X Sidewinder and a test pod on its left and right outboard underwing stations, respectively. Moving inboard, there are two 500-pound-class Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) precision-guided bombs on dual bomb racks and a drop tank under each wing. The JDAMs are a mix of two standard GBU-38/B types and a pair of dual-mode GBU-54/B Laser JDAMs (LJDAM). All the weapons are inert training rounds. The aircraft also has an AN/AAQ-33 Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod on the right intake \"chin\" station. All of the munitions look to be inert.*\n\n*The loadout is one of many that could be seen on Bahraini Vipers during any future combat operations. In 2019, the U.S. government approved the potential sale of a slew of aerial weapons to the country to go along with these jets. This included AIM-120 AMRAAMs, AIM-9X Sidewinders, AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles, AGM-88 High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missiles (HARM), AGM-154 Joint Stand-off Weapon (JSOW) glide bombs, 250-pound-class GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bombs (SDB), and a wide variety of 500 and 2,000-pound class JDAM-series (including LJDAMs) and Paveway-series precision-guided bombs.*\n\n*Regardless of what loadouts they might fly with, the Block 70 F-16C/Ds will provide a significant boost to the Royal Bahrani Air Force's capabilities. Bahrain was the first Gulf State to operate F-16s of any kind, but its new Vipers are far more capable than the Block 40 versions it acquired in the 1990s. The most significant new feature found on Block 70 jets is the AN/APG-83 SABR active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar. The latest-generation Vipers, with their 12,000-hour airframe life, also come with a host of other major upgrades over older F-16s, such as cockpits with wide-panel digital displays, conformal fuel tanks, improved mission computers that give the jets a new 'digital backbone,\" and more, as you can read about in detail [here](https://www.twz.com/flying-the-block-70-f-16-ultimate-viper-according-to-its-test-pilot).*",

The head of this Kievan Metropolis started getting called Moscow Patriarch as a result of the giving of patriarchal status to that church. Then in the Ukrainian lands under the Polish-Lithuanian kingdom, there was a new Kiev Metropolis that was created. This Metropolis was then taken over by the Moscow Patriarchy as a result of the conquest of these lands and should not be counted as legitimate way of changing its jurisdiction.\n\nThe argument that the Ecumenical patriarchy used is that the Kiev Metropolis was never transferred from the jurisdiction of the Constantinople Patriarchy to the jurisdiction of the Moscow Patriarchy, however, the Kiev Metropolis had different borders and these borders were different from the ones of the current Ukrainian state. At the same time, Moscow Patriarchy\u2019s jurisdiction, when it was given the patriarchal status, covered the lands of Russia but Russia had different and way smaller borders back then (1589). The Constantinople Patriarchy had no clear border Northwest and Northeast as far as I am aware and I know of cases in the 9-10th centuries pf both Roman and Constantinople priests operating in Central Europe, for example. \n\nOne question is what is the basis on which the Ecumenical Patriarchy asserts that it has jurisdiction over all of Ukraine considering it uses the Kiev Metropolis that had different borders not covering all of Ukraine.\n\nThis also implies that the Moscow patriarchy does not have authority over territories outside of the Tzardom but at the same time you can still argue that, because they extended the jurisdiction for Ukraine, Russia can extend its jurisdiction too over the far East, for example. But why not extend over parts of Ukraine, too, like Odessa which is a city created by the Russian empire that supposedly had a Muslim population initially and was not a part of the Kiev Metropolis.\n\nIn general, I think that it is true that the Kiev Metropolis was not officially transferred to the Patriarchate of Moscow, however, the situation with places like Odessa are questionable considering what I mentioned plus the fact that the Ecumenical Patriarchate cannot interfere in the deeds of other patriarchs. This is not canonical.\n\nTo be clear, what I say does not automatically make the Moscow Patriarchy correct or right because, to my knowledge, they are doing something similar in Africa now which should be under the jurisdiction of the Alexandrian patriarchate, however, you can make the same argument that when the status was given to the Alexandrian patriarchy, Africa as its borders meant what the Romans thought of it and not necessarily the whole of it since the continent was unexplored at that time.\n\nIn short, my opinion is that both the Moscow and the Ecumenical patriarchs are not acting in accordance to my meagre understanding of the Orthodox canon but I am no expert so so might be totally mistaken.",

            "body": "I was going to write about this tomorrow and I've been gathering some information on this in the recent days so I'll take the opportunity to summarize all here. \n\nThe Right Sector (Pravy Sektor) has always been a very hot potato to deal with politically and institutionally. They are really far-right and Ukrainian ultra-nationalists as well as followers of Bandera's thought. That is the difference with the Azov galaxy, which while having a far-right base has a very high Russian-speaking presence: Kharkiv and Dnipro are very important cities for the history of Azov, not by chance. While the voting basin for PS and the recruiting one for the Ukrainian Volunteer Corps (DUK) is, for the very vast majority, Western Ukraine.\n\nThe very creation of the 67th Mechanized Brigade was a kind of implicit \"pact\" between Zelensky, Zaluzhny and Stempitsky (the commander of the DUK back then). A regular and institutionalized unit and under the command of the Ground Forces where they would incorporate all the units of the Ukrainian Volunteer Corps, i.e. the military branch of Right Sector, as long as they maintained a certain autonomy and identity compared to the other brigades. Whereas the Azov units weren't confined in a single unit, have thrived and expanded.\n\nThey have generally shown themselves to be a capable unit in their combat history: primarily it's to their sacrifice that Ukraine owes the defense of the northern flank of the salient of Bakhmut (the area north-west of Khromove) in March/April 2023 - where Dmytro Kotsiubailo, known as \"Da Vinci\" (a battalion commander), fell in action. And besides, they were always sent to catch fire in the hottest sectors of the front, both because of the great courage and determination of their soldiers and because of the inconvenience  the existence of their unit brings.\n\nThe biggest problem is that the reverse side of the coin is that they are really hot-heads and it has always been difficult for them to be under the jurisdiction of the UAF. In the past there have been several coordination issues with both the command and the neighboring units because of the habit by the command and the servicemen of the 67th Brigade of doing as they please. And political disagreements, especially against Zelensky, have never been hidden.\n\n\nIn January two companies (\"Honor\" and \"Ulf\") had left the 1st Assault Battalion \"Da Vinci\" of the brigade and recreated their unit in the 59th Motorized Brigade as the 108th Mechanized Battalion. This plan was led by Alina Mykhailova (the fianc\u00e9e of the fallen Kotsiubailo) and other key figures of the unit close to Kotsiubailo and had already created tensions within the DUK. There were internal political disagreements within the 67th Brigade, also related to the proximity of the outcasts to the mayor of Lviv and the management of both the legacy and the inheritance of Kotsiubailo. \n\nWith Zaluzhny (coincidentally, from Western Ukraine), a personal friend of Stempitsky, a harmony had ensued in which the 67th Brigade retained a particular decision-making autonomy. But Syrsky (a Russian speaker, incidentally - like Zelensky, for that matter), has no patience or tolerance for the demands for autonomy by his subordinates: for better or worse, that's his personality. \n\nIn Ukrainian socials there is a very, very heated debate on this issue. DUK and PS have wide support in part of the population, particularly in Western Ukraine, and these people espouse the conspiracy theory that this is part of a Zelensky's plot against the Ukrainian military (which is something that runs deep in the Ukrainian debate, think of the Wagnergate case and the others, about which much could be written - and it got worse when Zaluzhny was fired). Other parts of the population, on the other hand, have never had much sympathy for PS in first place and for their overly extremist instances. \n\nWhat would have happened is that the 67th Brigade arrived in the second half of March in the Bakhmut sector following a rotation (I will write more about on the details at the tactical level another time) and was expected to defend several key positions without many issues, and therefore preventing the Russians from approaching Chasiv Yar, but that did not happen. There were serious problems with the brigade's battalion commanders that allowed the Russians to record tactical successes, with the loss of some key fortifications east of Chasiv Yar.\n\nAccording to several sources, including yours, the mobilized servicemen who are part of this brigade are viewed with some disdain by those from PS/DUK (who are all volunteers), and used for expendable purposes, like there were two different units in the same unit. This has severely exacerbated the problems and has been among the main causes for the loss of the positions, despite the fact that this brigade had been amply supplied in the past months with mobilized personnel and equipment.\n\nThe brigade is being heavily scrutinized by inspectors from the MoD and it now appears that the 67th Brigade will be entirely cleansed of any person with ties to PS/DUK (both the commanders and the soldiers). Syrsky took the opportunity to put the nail in the coffin on the issue. They have already made a new FB page removing references to the two latter organizations and will probably change their logo in the future. So it will become a \"normal\" brigade like the others. While those with links to PS/DUK will be scattered into the other brigades. In fact, as those in the Ukrainian Volunteer Corps itself have denounced, it's a total and forced dismantling of their organization. Let's note that there are Ukrainians very much in favor of this, who instead say that not enough people have been removed from the brigade! Proof of the mixed feelings the DUK generates.",

They were the ones who were able to grind out decent tactical, even operational victories south of Bakhmut last summer. Can't be overstated how much retaking Klishchiivka helped to improve their defensive position, which in hindsight is what the offensive should've been focused on.

The same leaks however also stated that the price could be lowered to $50k using the new purpose built manufacturing facilities in Russia.\n\nJust thinking about the basic microeconomics here, the price isn't driven solely by the cost, but also by the demand. It's entirely possible (practically certain, actually) that Russia paid hefty premiums for rapid delivery, the early in-theater training and technical support from Iranian personnel, and/or as part of a larger technology transfer deal. So even if the costs were in that $10k-20k range, Russia may have accepted a much higher price.\n\nAlso I suspect the early cost estimates that emerged shortly after the first deployment of Shaheds to Ukraine were based on Iran's pre-war cost structure, which may be suffering the effects of heightened sanctions enforcement and inflation, which I expect is more acute for sanctioned dual purpose goods. Not only because of the sanctions, but also because of the massively increased global demand for arms following the full scale invasion, with Russia itself, Ukraine, and many other re-arming countries competing to purchase the same industrial inputs for their domestic arms industries that Iran needs for Shaheds. Tightening the screws on Russian imports of dual purpose products following 2/2022 almost certainly had the incidental effect of closing holes in the western sanctions regime that Iran had also been exploiting to source parts.
