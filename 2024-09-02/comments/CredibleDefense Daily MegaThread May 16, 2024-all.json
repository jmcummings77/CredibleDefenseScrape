        "body": "A quick update to what [I wrote](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/1csj2h8/comment/l488c17/) yesterday - then I'll post the analysis from DeepState about the beginning of the events in the Kharkiv sector and another from an Ukrainian Telegram channel on the problems of how the construction work of fortifications is carried and managed.\n\nThe day before yesterday, servicemen of the 92nd Assault Brigade (as I had written, its 1st Assault Battalion and its 22nd Motorized Battalion should be in the sector) together with operators of the 8th SOF Regiment took several Russian POWs in the northern part of the area of the dachas to the east of the Travyanske Reservoir, between Hlyboke and Lyptsi. The POWs belong to the 11th Tank Regiment of the 18th Motorized Division of the 11th Corps. This should also confirm Ukrainian control over the vast majority of the area of the dachas, at the moment.\n\nhttps://t. me/WarArchive_ua/14908\n\nRegarding the 18th Motorized Division, yesterday, reporting what the Ukrainian observer Mashovets stated, I wrote that there were four of its motorized regiments (9th, 79th, 275th, 280th) in the sector, along with its tank regiment. This division has always been quite mysterious and I was a bit amazed that it has five organic maneuver regiments. I investigated thoroughly  on Russian social media and while the 275th and 280th Motorized Regiments were actually created in 2021, these two units were never mentioned during the \u201cSMO\u201d and there is no military unit code associated with them. Mashovets is very reliable, but I am inclined to think that these two regiments don't exist (not even as regiments of the Territorial Forces) and the 18th Motorized Division is formed by the 9th and 79th Motorized Regiments along with the 11th Tank Regiment, which makes more sense.\n\nThis morning the \u201cKhartiia\u201d Brigade of the National Guard released a video showing the repelling of a Russian assault/reconnaissance group, which arrived at the gates of Lyptsi from the north-east (attacking from Lukyantsi), with an advance of about 3 kms from the initial positions. Elements of the \u201cKhartiia\u201d Brigade had recently arrived in the sector, along with elements of the \u201cRubizh\u201d Brigade of the National Guard.\n\nhttps://t. me/motopatriot/23010\n\nhttps://t. me/WarArchive_ua/14929\n\nThis geolocation shows another Russian advance from Lukyantsi in the direction of Lyptsi, near the course of the Lypets River.\n\nhttps://t. me/EjShahidenko/2683\n\nIn this area, the Russians' objective is to enter Lyptsi and seize the dam in the southern shore of the Travyanske Reservoir, which would force the Ukrainians out of the area of the dachas.\n\nThere is still a Ukrainian presence north of the Starytsia River: operational units of the HUR have engaged in clashes against the Russians on the road between Starytsia and Buhruvatka; the Russians should still have no control over the road bridge over the Siversky Donets, between Buhruvatka and Prylipka.\n\nhttps://t. me/EjShahidenko/2672\n\nThe Russians are unable to force the Vovcha either from the east (in north-eastern outskirts of Vovchansk) or from the west of Vovchansk (from Hatyshche to the pine forest south of the river), which is why they are continuing to attack Vovchansk frontally, with a tough urban battle going on.\n\nIn the town, the Russians have achieved clear advances: between yesterday and this morning they occupied the Vovchansk Central District Hospital and are approaching the Vovchansk Aggregates Plant; there is fighting in the area of the high rises in the central part of the half of Vovchansk to the north of the Vovcha River.\n\nhttps://t. me/creamy_caprice/5541\n\nhttps://t. me/motopatriot/23002\n\nThe current status of the eastern part of the town (the one to the north of the Vovcha River), is unclear - the Russians had occupied positions in the north-eastern outskirts of the town and are currently moving towards the cemetery from the west too. In any case, even if the Russians were to occupy the entire half of Vovchansk north of the Vovcha River, the river itself may be a line of defense.\n\nAccording to this Russian Telegram channel, which reports news about the Group of Forces \u201cNorth\u201d (I discovered it because it was reposted by a channel close to VDV and critical of Teplinsky which I follow), on May 14 the units of the GoF \u201cNorth\u201d had 76 KIAs and 203 WIAs (also claiming to have lost 36 units of equipment, 17 of them irreparably - in this case I guess since the beginning of the offensive); the 41st Motorized Regiment of the 72nd Motorized Division of 44th Corps in particular reportedly had relevant losses inside Vovchansk, so reinforcements from 44th Corps should arrive in the future: additional subunits from the 30th Motorized Regiment of the 72nd Motorized Division; by the end of the month the full deployment of the 128th Motorized Brigade is expected. For the Ukrainian observer Mashovets, the assault groups of the 18th Motorized Division of the 11th Corps are losing offensive capabilities, and his assessments confirm what I had mentioned yesterday: at the moment Russia has meager reserves in the area, with the 44th Corps still having to finish its formation and at least until more units arrive from other sectors.\n\nhttps://t. me/severnnyi/1034\n\nhttps://t. me/severnnyi/1031\n\nThe other channel I mentioned complains that operators from a detachment of the 322nd GRU Training Center which is involved in the operations in Kharkiv are sent to assault fortified areas, resulting in many wounded and some dead.\n\nhttps://t. me/vdv_za_chestnost_spravedlivost/2412\n\nA Russian POW from the 138th Motorized Brigade of the 6th CAA was taken inside Vovchansk: at least one battalion of the brigade is involved in the actions. The POW states that his brigade and the 25th Motorized Brigade (6th CAA) were tasked to capture Vovchansk in two days. There is no evidence to confirm that the 25th Motorized Brigade is in the area; as far as we know, it is currently doing what it has been doing since the summer: attacking Synkivka in the Kupyansk sector. Mashovets stated that it might be moved to Kharkiv in the future, though. Along with the POW of the 138th Motorized Brigade, a POW of the 7th Military Base (49th CAA) was taken, but this unit has never been spotted in the sector (it's currently in the southern flank of Bakhmut), so we don't know if there has been a transfer of troops between units or elements of the 7th Military Base had been deployed along the state border and got involved in the actions.\n\nhttps://t. me/poisk_in_ua/58996\n\nhttps://t. me/ButusovPlus/10322\n\nRussian Lancets are very active in the sector, which is a big problem for Ukrainian heavy equipment. As for artillery, in general, the arrival of US aid has greatly [improved](https://www.rferl.org/amp/ukraine-chasiv-yar-donbas-defenses-struggles-russia/32941305.html) the situation for 105mm artillery, which guns had been mostly silent during the winter. In contrast, the situation is still very bad for 152mm artillery. According to Ukrainian reports, the Russian Krasnopol shells are a serious and growing problem; however, it's reported that the Ukrainian Air Force has significantly increased precision air strikes - according to this Ukrainian officer, it looks like France is supplying much more than 50 AASM bombs per month.\n\nhttps://t. me/officer_alex33/2758\n\nhttps://t. me/officer_alex33/2741\n\nIn the Svatove sector, according to the update published this morning by DeepState (and confirmed by geolocations), the Russians (elements of the 2nd Motorized Division of the 1st GTA) recorded an advance of 2 kms, approaching Berestove (attacking from Krokhmalne), against the positions of the 77th Airmobile Brigade. Elements of the 110th TDF Brigade recently arrived in Berestove as reinforcements.\n\nhttps://t. me/WarArchive_ua/14927\n\nIn the post below I will publish DeepState's report which was released this morning. Translated via DeepL. My additions are between [square brackets].",

The POW states that his brigade and the 25th Motorized Brigade (6th CAA) were tasked to capture Vovchansk in two days. There is no evidence to confirm that the 25th Motorized Brigade is in the area; as far as we know, it is currently doing what it has been doing since the summer: attacking Synkivka in the Kupyansk sector. Mashovets stated that it might be moved to Kharkiv in the future, though. Along with the POW of the 138th Motorized Brigade, a POW of the 7th Military Base (49th CAA) was taken, but this unit has never been spotted in the sector (it&#39;s currently in the southern flank of Bakhmut), so we don&#39;t know if there has been a transfer of troops between units or elements of the 7th Military Base had been deployed along the state border and got involved in the actions.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a>. me/poisk_in_ua/58996</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a>. me/ButusovPlus/10322</p>\n\n<p>Russian Lancets are very active in the sector, which is a big problem for Ukrainian heavy equipment. As for artillery, in general, the arrival of US aid has greatly <a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/amp/ukraine-chasiv-yar-donbas-defenses-struggles-russia/32941305.html\">improved</a> the situation for 105mm artillery, which guns had been mostly silent during the winter. In contrast, the situation is still very bad for 152mm artillery. According to Ukrainian reports, the Russian Krasnopol shells are a serious and growing problem; however, it&#39;s reported that the Ukrainian Air Force has significantly increased precision air strikes - according to this Ukrainian officer, it looks like France is supplying much more than 50 AASM bombs per month.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a>. me/officer_alex33/2758</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a>. me/officer_alex33/2741</p>\n\n<p>In the Svatove sector, according to the update published this morning by DeepState (and confirmed by geolocations), the Russians (elements of the 2nd Motorized Division of the 1st GTA) recorded an advance of 2 kms, approaching Berestove (attacking from Krokhmalne), against the positions of the 77th Airmobile Brigade. Elements of the 110th TDF Brigade recently arrived in Berestove as reinforcements.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://t\">https://t</a>. me/WarArchive_ua/14927</p>\n\n<p>In the post below I will publish DeepState&#39;s report which was released this morning.

We will be talking exclusively about the fighters who directly took part in the fighting in this area and are still taking part in it.\n\n>\ud83d\udcc6 The 125th entered this area last summer and until January this year, the area was extremely quiet. Even the enemy artillery was extremely quiet, and the gray zone was up to 5 km in both directions. But in January, the Katsaps [Russians] began to hit the equipment and places of its concentration.\n\n>\ud83d\udea9 Regarding the IFS [engineering and fortification structures]: according to the fighters, it was difficult to mine at zero [first line] because the enemy was monitoring the border. Some of the trenches were covered with sand and not lined with wood. Yes, there are a lot of concrete pillboxes, but they are not covered and not closed. There were no concrete dugouts in Lukyantsi. There was not a single trench completely covered with wood. Although the fighters made improvements on their own, starting to sheathe it with wood.\n\n>\ud83e\uddf1 In recent months, the Katsaps have begun to actively occupy the gray zone - digging in, creating entire ROPs [company-strongholds]. Immediately, the fighters began to inform the brigade's leadership that something had to be done about it, because the enemy should not be allowed to build up its forces. Unfortunately, the neighboring artillery was not properly engaged. In early May, the enemy began amassing troops in Solntsevka [RU]. At that time, the enemy's positions were already behind the village, but they began to actively amass in the village. The accumulation was repeatedly reported to the top.\n\n>\ud83d\ude80There were cases when our artillery missed by a few hundred meters, but the brigade upstairs reported it as a hit. Thus, the illusion was created that the guns were firing.\n\n>\ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddfa On May 7, the Katsaps began to be spotted directly in Pylna [UA] itself. At that time, the brigade ignored the targeting of the village and continued to hit checkpoints on the territory of the so-called Russian Federation. On May 8, the first contact battle took place in that area, resulting in the loss of a SP [observation outposts] and 2 soldiers of the SOU [Defense Forces] were killed. After that, the artillery finally started working, but because the enemy was hiding in the plantations in the immediate vicinity of our positions, the effectiveness was so-so.\n\n>\ud83c\udfda On May 8-9, the Katsaps are actively quartering in Pylyna. On the approaches, accumulations of troops, LATs [I think it's vehicles] and weapons are recorded. But due to the uncoordinated actions of the brigade, the artillery could not be sufficiently effective. At the same time, the enemy began firing at the brigade's positions with rockets and missiles.\n\n>\u2694\ufe0f On May 10, the enemy offensive began. The first attacks were partially repelled by the 125th Brigade's soldiers. However, one of the 400th [of the 4xx-th series] rifle battalions (the idea of their creation, training and equipment will become one of the biggest mysteries of this war) was stationed near the village of Strilecha, and was forced to leave the position due to the enemy's superiority in manpower and lack of support from neighboring forces. On May 11, the Katsaps attacked Lukyantsi, and the guys from the HUR came to support the TRO [TDF], and the resistance became more effective, although due to the enemy's superiority and the actual encirclement of the positions in the village, the Defense Forces had to withdraw from it. At the same time, another battalion of the 125th was repelling attacks in the area of Zelene. This fact became known only later, and at first it was believed that the village was lost.\n\n>\ud83d\uded1To summarize. Indeed, there were facts of the withdrawal of certain units - OSBs [separate rifle battalions] and reserve companies, which were on paper BGs [combat-ready], but in fact filled with limitedly fit and retired people. At the same time, the main forces of the 125th Separate Territorial Defense Brigade continue to resist. The soldiers held out and waited for the reserve units to approach, preventing the front from collapsing. We're not talking about brigade command now, let the OTU [Operational-Tactical Group] deal with it, but the infantry of the 125th did everything in their power in the face of a superior enemy. It is worth noting other units that entered the battle from the wheels and helped to hold on.\n\n>\ud83e\udee1 We believe that the military and political leadership will appreciate the contribution of each soldier, and that there will be strict responsibility for negligence.\n\nhttps://t. me/DeepStateUA/19501\n\nOn a related note, I will now publish the other post I mentioned at the beginning, which is very interesting. I would just add that as much as there may have been problems with corruption, negligence in the construction of fortifications, etc, we should remember the construction workers who paid with their lives for the fortification works near the border with Russia in Kharkiv Oblast. Here is an example (NSFL) of what it means to work so close to the border: https://t. me/cossacksss/3211\n\n>Say a word about good trenches.\n\n>Or about the sore point about fortification.\n\n>Fortification, as you know, is one of the most ancient elements of military science; it is incredibly relevant to this day since the times of the Roman Empire. After all, as soon as the legions entered some new lands, it all began with the arrangement of field bases and defensive fortifications.\n\n>But this is a small lyrical digression.\n\n>The Defence Forces' engineering support system in all branches of the military, as a rule, consists of the department of a brigade / battalion assigned to the zone and area of \u200b\u200bdefense. As we all know, according to the BS [military regulations, likely], the depth of defense of a mechanized brigade is approximately 12 km in depth and up to 25 km along the front. Naturally, these figures are not any dogma and they may differ for one reason or another (for example, one of the battalions was transferred from the brigade to the operational subordination of the TGr [Tactical Group] or other temporary formation, weakening the defensive and offensive capabilities of the brigade in its defense zone)\n\n>Let's start small.\n\n>A battalion usually consists of 3-4 mechanized (or motorized infantry, rifle) companies, a mortar battery, a fire support company + separate platoons and a battalion first aid post. Its standards include a BRO [battalion defense area] area of \u200b\u200bup to 5 km along the front and up to 3 km in depth.\n\n>The battalion commander, the deputy battalion commander for combat training, and the engineer platoon commander are directly responsible for engineering support in the battalion. Also, company commanders at their company-strongholds with platoon commanders are responsible for the condition of the positions and their equipment (improvement) in engineering terms.\n\n>That is, on average, at 2-3 km along the front and 2-3 km in depth, an entire engineering platoon is responsible for the condition of mine-explosive and non-explosive engineering obstacles! Is it a lot or a little? Surely those who have encountered the issue of organizing engineering support know that this is not only not enough, it is critically insufficient. The WIS [engineer sapper battalion] is constantly used to check blasting lines, the condition of engineering barriers, etc, so they simply may not have time to equip designated areas.\n\n>In most cases, weak official control on the part of officials leads to the fact that they simply \u201cneglect\u201d their duties and work.\n\n>Now to something more interesting: sometimes it happens that some positions are changed by 2-3 units in a couple of months, which, knowing the frequency of these changes and rotations, do not properly equip certain positions in the defense area.\n\n>The situation is interesting, isn't it? Go ahead.\n\n>What a brigade has: as a rule, it is an engineer company and people from individual platoons, companies or support battalions brought in to help them. The brigade has (often) large resources and facilities, such as engineering equipment, engineering equipment, etc, which significantly expands operational capabilities.\n\n>But as was written above, it happens that from \u201cnon-dangerous\u201d directions, engineers are urgently seconded from these same brigades to other \u201cdangerous\u201d directions, and in the \u201cnon-dangerous\u201d directions nothing is dug at all, or they are dug with extremely low intensity.\n\n>As for the OMV [Operational Group], OTU [Operational-Tactical Group], OSUV [Operational-Strategic Group], they do not have their own separate engineering departments. There are people seconded from some brigades.\n\n>Regarding the state of the engineering barriers in Kharkiv: everything that I described above happened. There are indeed engineering barriers, fortifications, etc, but they are equipped extremely heterogeneously and disunitedly. In some places it is really good, in others it is very bad. (no specifics on directions).\n\n>As long as the OMV/OTU is responsible for engineering support, this will happen.\nUntil the full responsibility for fortification falls on the shoulders of the brigades, this will continue to happen.\n\nhttps://t. me/ukr_sisu/115\n\nhttps://t. me/ukr_sisu/116",

If they sound optimistic about the improvement on the first two fronts - they say that fortifications have been built since spring - they criticize the mobilization strategy of the Ukrainian government. \"Ukraine has not ran out of men\", but they argue that the delayed mobilization is now costing Ukraine's army the capacity to rotate and to give necessary rest to their elite units, while the army is skewing older (40 on average). At this point, an effective mobilization campaign is key, they argue. Personally I can't help but think that Zelenskyy wants to have the cake and eat it too by staying in power, remaining popular, and somehow win the war. Unfortunately both the West and Ukraine's policy have sensibly killed Ukrainians' willingness to voluntarily enroll in the army, one by denying aid at a critical time, the other by dismissing the popular CinC and showing disregard for soldiers' wellbeing (that some of them have not rested since the war started is insane). \n\nOn the Russian side, they argue that quantity has a quality of its own, and that they can create a headache for Ukrainians with this maneuver in the north to attain their primary war aims in the south-east. At the same time, while Russians manage to conscript about 30k people a month, they are also on the older side, and they are burning through equipment by using stocks that would take years to rebuild. \n\nThe article shares the common idea that if Ukraine survives 2024, they may, in the best case scenario, even reconstitute offensive potential. However, a lot is at stake in the coming months. \n\nThe article does not touch on the potential material support of China to the invasion, a scary consequence of this summit that could change the balance, nor on the consequences of the 2024 US elections.",

Then we have war production, and while war contracts are bid on by nominally private/ish companies, they aren't affected by the CB rate either, bc war contracts are paid in full up front, so no borrowing is required.   So, who pays the 16%+ market borrowing rate?  Regular businesses and civilians for small loans (civilians have subsidized loans available for buying real estate).  This is a relatively tiny portion of the economy, and from the gvt perspective, quite wasteful bc they eat up precious foreign currency by consuming imports.  And all things considered, the consumer sector has been pretty resilient, bc a whole lot of defense related cash is trickling down.  Sign up bonuses and death/injury benefits are absolutely staggering - folks making 5-20 times their previous earnings.  This creates a knock - on effect where private sector now has to compete for labor (unemployment rate is effectively zero) by raising their salaries. So there's a lot of money sloshing around the consumer sector, and CB is hoping to use the funds rate to keep the inflation pressure down.   However, considering that the bulk of the economy is insulated from borrowing rates, and those sectors are the source of all this helicopter money, while CB may be pulling the rate lever, I suspect it's attached to nothing.   Hence the steady classification of more and more economic data, bc if you can't achieve low inflation, cook the books and say you did anyway.  As is the Putin way.",

The Ukrainians were getting butchered by the Mi-28 and Ka-52 launching long-range ATGMs from beyond effective SAM range. \n\nIt also helps slow down Russian air force operational tempo a great deal. They'll have to fly an extra 500 km or so each and every mission. That's more wear on the engines and will force them to do more maintenance. We've also seen ATACMS striking fuel and ammunition depots. It's not as spectacular this time as M31 rockets were originally, because the Russians do grudgingly learn, but it's imposing more and more strain on Russian logistical systems, which again impacts optempo. Imagine now when a tank break down, now you have to truck it 300 km to a repair depot that's out of range, or you have to decentralize maintenance operations. \n\nIf the Ukrainians want to try and do something spectacular when they get their F-16s, ATACMS will also be very important for SEAD. That's afterall one of its primary reasons to exist.\n\nIn terms of, \"everything has a dollar cost,\" that's not really true. For one, the F-16s aren't being provided by the USA. Second, NATO is giving what it feels comfortable giving. There isn't 10 billion worth of land mines sitting in a warehouse in the US Southwest. Ukraine is getting F-16s because they're being replaced with F-35s, and they're getting ATACMS (now) because it's being replaced by PrSM.

                    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I don&#39;t agree at all. ATACMS pushes Russian rotary-wing aviation well back to the point they probably either have to sacrifice combat load or loiter time. The Ukrainians were getting butchered by the Mi-28 and Ka-52 launching long-range ATGMs from beyond effective SAM range. </p>\n\n<p>It also helps slow down Russian air force operational tempo a great deal. They&#39;ll have to fly an extra 500 km or so each and every mission. That&#39;s more wear on the engines and will force them to do more maintenance. We&#39;ve also seen ATACMS striking fuel and ammunition depots. It&#39;s not as spectacular this time as M31 rockets were originally, because the Russians do grudgingly learn, but it&#39;s imposing more and more strain on Russian logistical systems, which again impacts optempo. Imagine now when a tank break down, now you have to truck it 300 km to a repair depot that&#39;s out of range, or you have to decentralize maintenance operations. </p>\n\n<p>If the Ukrainians want to try and do something spectacular when they get their F-16s, ATACMS will also be very important for SEAD. That&#39;s afterall one of its primary reasons to exist.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of, &quot;everything has a dollar cost,&quot; that&#39;s not really true. For one, the F-16s aren&#39;t being provided by the USA. Second, NATO is giving what it feels comfortable giving. There isn&#39;t 10 billion worth of land mines sitting in a warehouse in the US Southwest. Ukraine is getting F-16s because they&#39;re being replaced with F-35s, and they&#39;re getting ATACMS (now) because it&#39;s being replaced by PrSM.

                "body": "The strategy is not \"bombing Palestinians into submission until they turn on Hamas\". If that were the case there wouldn't be a [civilian to combatant ratio of around 1.2](https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-says-tensions-with-us-make-it-harder-to-get-hostages-out/) despite Hamas constantly hiding behind civilians in an environment that has been engineered for decades to create the maximum amount of human shielding.\n\nThe actual Netanyahu strategy is to attack Hamas at every opportunity until it doesn't have the weaponry or organizational structure to threaten Israel. This would be a gradual process of course - for example, Hamas must have arms caches all over the place, but these can gradually be found and destroyed.\n\nThe problem with this approach in isolation, a problem that many other Israeli politicians and generals are articulating, is that the IDF can't be everywhere at all times (at least not for an affordable price in money and lives), and the resulting power vacuum will be (and is) filled by the best armed group remaining, i.e. Hamas. So, these other Israeli figures as well as Biden are saying, Israel should set up some group like the Palestinian Authority to govern Gaza. As the government, it would presumably desire a monopoly on force, which would be achieved by suppressing independent displays of Hamas force. Israel has long promoted the rule of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank for similar reasons.\n\nTo this Netanyahu has replied that it is not realistic to introduce an alternative government right now, when there are still heavily armed Hamas forces in Rafah and the central strip. If Israel were to completely withdraw, the alternative government would quickly be overwhelmed by Hamas just as it was in 2007. So he wants to delay this until the remaining organized Hamas forces are wiped out. \n\nTo this the obvious reply is that the alternative government should be planned now so that there is no unnecessary delay in establishing it later. And moreover, it might even be possible to established it now in Gaza City where Hamas is weak, and its authority extended to the rest of the strip later.\n\nNetanyahu probably has another argument (although I have not heard him say it) which is that Hamas is so overwhelmingly popular now, and will remain so indefinitely (as no Arab army since 1948 has matched their achievement of invading Israel and taking territory even temporarily), that it will probably tolerate or even openly support Hamas, rather than suppressing it. To this the counterargument is presumably that such a situation is no worse and possibly better than Hamas running things outright. And while the weapons provided to this government might sometimes be turned on Israel, these would be light weapons and their strategic threat miniscule compared to the threat of a Gaza run by Hamas.\n\nI think it is important to see the elements of truth in both sides of this argument. Yes there needs to be a Palestinian-run government at some point, and Netanyahu has been delaying the work in that direction for bad reasons. But it is also true that such a government needs to be given an environment in which it can succeed, and that requires further destruction of Hamas forces in Rafah and central Gaza, as well as Israeli control over the Egypt border to prevent the smuggling which creates a large part of Hamas's power (both weapons and money) in the strip.",
                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>The strategy is not &quot;bombing Palestinians into submission until they turn on Hamas&quot;. If that were the case there wouldn&#39;t be a <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-says-tensions-with-us-make-it-harder-to-get-hostages-out/\">civilian to combatant ratio of around 1.2</a> despite Hamas constantly hiding behind civilians in an environment that has been engineered for decades to create the maximum amount of human shielding.</p>\n\n<p>The actual Netanyahu strategy is to attack Hamas at every opportunity until it doesn&#39;t have the weaponry or organizational structure to threaten Israel. This would be a gradual process of course - for example, Hamas must have arms caches all over the place, but these can gradually be found and destroyed.</p>\n\n<p>The problem with this approach in isolation, a problem that many other Israeli politicians and generals are articulating, is that the IDF can&#39;t be everywhere at all times (at least not for an affordable price in money and lives), and the resulting power vacuum will be (and is) filled by the best armed group remaining, i.e. Hamas. So, these other Israeli figures as well as Biden are saying, Israel should set up some group like the Palestinian Authority to govern Gaza. As the government, it would presumably desire a monopoly on force, which would be achieved by suppressing independent displays of Hamas force. Israel has long promoted the rule of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank for similar reasons.</p>\n\n<p>To this Netanyahu has replied that it is not realistic to introduce an alternative government right now, when there are still heavily armed Hamas forces in Rafah and the central strip. If Israel were to completely withdraw, the alternative government would quickly be overwhelmed by Hamas just as it was in 2007. So he wants to delay this until the remaining organized Hamas forces are wiped out. </p>\n\n<p>To this the obvious reply is that the alternative government should be planned now so that there is no unnecessary delay in establishing it later. And moreover, it might even be possible to established it now in Gaza City where Hamas is weak, and its authority extended to the rest of the strip later.</p>\n\n<p>Netanyahu probably has another argument (although I have not heard him say it) which is that Hamas is so overwhelmingly popular now, and will remain so indefinitely (as no Arab army since 1948 has matched their achievement of invading Israel and taking territory even temporarily), that it will probably tolerate or even openly support Hamas, rather than suppressing it. To this the counterargument is presumably that such a situation is no worse and possibly better than Hamas running things outright. And while the weapons provided to this government might sometimes be turned on Israel, these would be light weapons and their strategic threat miniscule compared to the threat of a Gaza run by Hamas.</p>\n\n<p>I think it is important to see the elements of truth in both sides of this argument.

            "body": "The key issue for Ukraine is the need to simultaneously develop a high level of deterrence that is also sustainable with their relatively limited financial resources. On a ground forces side this means they need to pursue a mobilization strategy similar to Finland. Where they push all men through a conscription and training period when they are ~18. This gives them a massive pool of trained reservists to call up in time of war; training for these forces should focus primarily on basic proficiency and defense. Back this with a relatively small professional military and you now have the ability to deploy a large force well equipped for defensive operations. That small scale force should be your mobile forces capable of offensive operations. This would give Ukraine e at least some means of conducting counter attacks. At the moment this is a serious lack of capability for Ukraine as any Russian gains cannot be reversed. \n\nThis focus of effective defense needs to be matched in the air. Primarily this should come from ground based air defenses, they are far cheaper than maintaining a large Air Force and as proved in Ukraine can effectively stop most enemies air ops. This might be an area where Ukraine should focus their domestic industry. As what Ukraine primarily needs is relatively short range low cost interceptors; Ukraine has proven that they have a good rocketry industry that might be up to this task. The higher end ballistic missile defense and long range air defense can be left for foreign supplied systems. For the actual Air Force this will largely be relegated to foreign donations. Ukraine doesn\u2019t have the financial means to acquire hundreds of aircraft. But they likely could leverage their low cost of labor to maintain them. Such a capability would be critical going forward. \n\nIn the naval realm Ukraine shouldn\u2019t wast time or money developing a traditional navy. The geographic constraints of the Black Sea means drone boats and shore based /air launches cruise missiles can deny the entire area to enemy ships. If Ukraine continues developing this capability that would be a significant deterrent against Russian aggression. Ukraine should however focus on procuring mine sweeping capabilities as this is something russia has been willing to use so far and could be used as part of a future hybrid warfare strategy. \n\nThe main offensive deterrent Ukraine can feasibly afford is in long range strike drones. These could be further developed to make them largely autonomous and thus immune from most electronic warfare.

However building their defenses like this will maximize the chances that they survive long enough for foreign aid to arrive and that foreign powers are confident their aid will not be wasted on a lost cause.",
            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>The key issue for Ukraine is the need to simultaneously develop a high level of deterrence that is also sustainable with their relatively limited financial resources. On a ground forces side this means they need to pursue a mobilization strategy similar to Finland. Where they push all men through a conscription and training period when they are ~18. This gives them a massive pool of trained reservists to call up in time of war; training for these forces should focus primarily on basic proficiency and defense. Back this with a relatively small professional military and you now have the ability to deploy a large force well equipped for defensive operations. That small scale force should be your mobile forces capable of offensive operations. This would give Ukraine e at least some means of conducting counter attacks. At the moment this is a serious lack of capability for Ukraine as any Russian gains cannot be reversed. </p>\n\n<p>This focus of effective defense needs to be matched in the air. Primarily this should come from ground based air defenses, they are far cheaper than maintaining a large Air Force and as proved in Ukraine can effectively stop most enemies air ops. This might be an area where Ukraine should focus their domestic industry. As what Ukraine primarily needs is relatively short range low cost interceptors; Ukraine has proven that they have a good rocketry industry that might be up to this task. The higher end ballistic missile defense and long range air defense can be left for foreign supplied systems. For the actual Air Force this will largely be relegated to foreign donations. Ukraine doesn\u2019t have the financial means to acquire hundreds of aircraft. But they likely could leverage their low cost of labor to maintain them. Such a capability would be critical going forward. </p>\n\n<p>In the naval realm Ukraine shouldn\u2019t wast time or money developing a traditional navy. The geographic constraints of the Black Sea means drone boats and shore based /air launches cruise missiles can deny the entire area to enemy ships. If Ukraine continues developing this capability that would be a significant deterrent against Russian aggression. Ukraine should however focus on procuring mine sweeping capabilities as this is something russia has been willing to use so far and could be used as part of a future hybrid warfare strategy. </p>\n\n<p>The main offensive deterrent Ukraine can feasibly afford is in long range strike drones. These could be further developed to make them largely autonomous and thus immune from most electronic warfare. They could also be fielded in mass and combined with Ukraines domestically produced cruise missiles to help overcome air defenses. Such a strike capability would significantly deter Russian aggression as the moment a conflict arises Russia will need to face thousands of strike drones hitting their domestic military and dual use industries. </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately Ukraine will likely always be dependent on foreign powers for their truly high end and most large scale capabilities (such as massed artillery fires).

With a few dozen accounts, you can effectively influence a subreddit into one direction or another and over time you can achieve the \"desired state\" as the Airforce research paper puts it.\n\nSince online content (and the views it reinforces) spreads exponentially, all you have to do is get a thread or comment off the ground. Go around searching for new posts that fit your desired state and use your couple dozen accounts to get that post from +0 to +25. It's now dramatically more likely to show up on the front page with thousands of votes. Do it long enough and it becomes self-reinforcing. Humans rely on social proof and are incredibly sensitive to the views of who we consider our ideologically similar peers. The paper goes more into depth about this, I have the full PDF if you don't have academic access. \n\nImagine an inverse logarithmic function. The closer the similarity in perceived views, the stronger the reinforcement. But very quickly it reaches an asymptote where the influence is minimal when we perceive the person or content as opposed to our views.\n\nThe evidence would be very hard to find, even through careful statistical analysis. 25 votes out 5000 is a half percent. You'd be looking for very small fluctuations and it's not hard to obfuscate this type of interference and make it harder to find. And any difference can be plausibly explained away \"when people talk about politics, they are more intense and polarized therefore that's why voting patterns are different\"\n\nLet me take a step back and ask a more general question. Do you believe that the US government manipulates social media sites or not? \n\nI personally believe there is enough circumstantial evidence for this to be likely true. \n\nThen if you do agree that they probably are, why would they not want to influence reddit, one of the largest sites on the internet?\n\nI've been on this website since its inception. I remember in 2016 there was a subreddit I used to frequent, a noam chomsky sub. During the 2016 election cycle, I noticed a change in the voting patterns in the sub. The whole personality of the sub shifted as if overnight. \n\nI decided to do some statistical analysis. Back then reddit had an API that made this fairly simple with a couple of Python libraries. I would scan the sub, get the most recent threads, take a history of the comments at specific time intervals, and then look at the voting patterns as well as stats about the posters of threads & the highest scoring comments.\n\nThe shift was dramatic from one month to another - comments that ended up with the highest votes got there quicker and the age of accounts posting threads was dramatically younger.\n\nThe sub went from a place to talk about Chomsky's work - including his model of propaganda, his political beliefs, his linguistic work, etc and then it transformed into a center-left leaning sub sort of like the main politics default sub.
