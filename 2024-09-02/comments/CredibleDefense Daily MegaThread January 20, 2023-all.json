The Stockholm Agreement is denounced, the ships will NOT be inspected.\n\n- Roads between the territories controlled by the parties will be opened in accordance with what the technical committees have agreed.\n\n- Sanaa Airport will open for flights to several destinations, including the Persian Gulf countries, Arab countries, Africa and Asia.\n\n2) Economic issues:\n\n- Saudi Arabia will pay ALL SALARIES to employees of the state apparatus and state employees in provinces under the control of the Houthi government, including security personnel and military personnel).\n\n- The Houthis allow the export of Yemeni oil in exchange.\n\n- The funds will be deposited in the united Central Bank. Oman will monitor the payments.\n\n- The mechanism of payment of wages is still the subject of disputes (full payment - in hard currency or in Yemeni rials). They are trying to negotiate, the Houthis demand dollars, the Saudis want in rials (it is clear why).\n\n3) Military issues:\n\n- The comprehensive withdrawal of coalition forces from Yemen will begin as soon as negotiations on a final peace in Yemen begin.\n\n- There remain major disagreements between the two sides over the creation of a military buffer zone on the borders with Yemen. Riyadh wants the buffer zone to be 20 kilometers wide, and the Houthis insist that the buffer zone remain within the terms of the Taif Agreement of 1943 (from 6 to 12 km).\n\n- The Saudis want all the armed forces in Sanaa, Aden and Marib to be united under the auspices of the common Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Internal Affairs after the formation of the new government of Yemen. The Houthis formally agree, but most likely this issue will be put on the brakes.\n\n4) Political issues:\n\n- A truce will be concluded between all the intra-Yemeni factions.\n\n- Riyadh wants to get promises from Sana'a to expel the Saudi opposition from Yemen. The Houthis are thinking.\n\n- Riyadh needs security guarantees, as well as stability and good relations with Yemen in the future. The Houthis are thinking.\n\n5) The issue of reparations and restoration of the destroyed:\n\n- Riyadh offered to transfer $70 billion \"for reconstruction\", and the Houthis demand more than 200 billion.\n\n- The creation of a financial fund has been agreed, to which Riyadh, Abu Dhabi and Manama will make the main contribution. The Foundation will be responsible for the restoration of what was destroyed during the war.",

And to outflank Bakhmut from the west would require the Russians to totally punch through those uphill defenses, which are unlikely. So the H20 highway to Kostyantynivka won't be cut and unless the NE Russian axis from Soledar can travel around 110 degrees across the northern and western outskirts of the city, it can't be encircled. That means the only hope to take it is by direct urban assault, which will likely take months if they try and will make everything they've done so far seem like the easy part. \n\nIt was a bit troubling that the UAF lost Soledar and probably the salt mines too, but the terrain looks like the next defensive line behind it would be based on the village of Krasna Hora, and that'll protect the northern flank of Bakhmut for the time being.\n\nI think the UAF best prospects are actually a counterattack near Yakovlivka to the SW towards Pidhorodne along the T1302 highway. It's a drive of ~16 km. If it's successful, the entire Wagner force retreats or is encircled. Even if it only makes minor success it'll force the Russians to commit major resources to stop it. \n\nHowever, if they do that, they'll use up resources they might be husbanding for an offensive somewhere outside of that immediate area, so they might be content just by holding defensively. Though it's pretty crazy how many artillery brigades are in direct support of the Bakhmut sector, it might very well be the most during any point of the war, making it the new strategic main effort by default.",

But I'd be very interested to see how it's being done universally. Are they learning from spring-summer to create deeper and stouter fortifications? Are they devising TTPs to resist attackers without easily giving up their positions, such as much better camouflage, strict fire discipline, more snipers, heavier use of mortars of IDF with grenade launchers? Are they using a maneuver defense tactically below the brigade level, regularly retreating and counter-attacking? How deep are their defenses, in terms of number of lines? How is their EW? Are they actually losing the artillery fight? Stuff like that. They've probably gotten better.\n\nStrategically, it seems they've been following the \"hold at all cost\" policy pretty much since day 1. Early on there were claims by some that the deep penetrations by the Russians were purposeful, a deliberate strategy by the UAF done to cause the Russians to become overextended, especially their supply lines. But that turned out to be untrue, the Ukrainians were unprepared for the start of the war and simply couldn't stop the Russians. When they could, they held firm, like at Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, etc. But in other places they had to retreat because they couldn't organize a defense, got pushed out, took too many casualties, or from the threat of envelopment, like in Kherson or Zaporizhzhia oblasts. Once they got their shit together it was less frequent that they needed to retreat over time, but by and large they don't retreat unless the position becomes untenable, not able to be held anymore. And that continued on into the Donbas campaign and until now. \n\nWhen it's being done everywhere all the time it means it's strategic level, either top military brass or more likely political leadership made the call, since historically it's politicians that are the ones who usually come up with the reasons why retreats can't be allowed. Militarily, there are good reasons to allow retreats as necessary, especially at the tactical and operational level, and the RUSI prelim lessons report said the UAF wanted to perform a maneuver defense but were denied for political reasons. \n\nA maneuver defense is deliberately retreating without being decisively engaged. Perform the defense using maneuver warfare, ambushes while going backwards with constant counterattacks forwards, culminating in a massive counteroffensive when the enemy finally reaches their culmination point. It still uses attrition but it's not reliant on fighting positionally to achieve it, no need or desire for each side to dig in. The Russians are a prime example as to why to do it, an army really only fit to conduct set piece, highly planned positional battles, who have little tactical flexibility, a rigid command structure, poor comms, shoddy logistics, leadership issues, etc, all of which means they can't be good at maneuver warfare, will be better at positional warfare.

There is going to be an extended bureaucratic process to go through, especially in Germany, for any decision.

So we then start getting into hypotheticals of how to employ them.

The tanks will add to those battle groups. 50 Bradleys operating with 14 Challanger 2s will be formidable vs anything short of concentrated mass of very up to date Russian tanks like the T-72B3M or T-90Ms. And I question of those late models are available in numbers and distrubution for form armoured mass.",

And depending on the exact make can be much much harder to penetrate than a Russian tank of the same age.</p>\n\n<p>As for numbers, well its an open question and a political one.</p>\n\n<p>Russian tanks have allegedly been largely pulled back from the front so direct tank on tank would be a bit rarer. So we then start getting into hypotheticals of how to employ them. Most likely the large number of IFVs arriving will dominate the battle space and tanks will work as the big swingers attached to IFV batallions.</p>\n\n<p>The 150 Bradleys and CV90s , together with any Strykers with cannons will have a massive impact. The tanks will add to those battle groups. 50 Bradleys operating with 14 Challanger 2s will be formidable vs anything short of concentrated mass of very up to date Russian tanks like the T-72B3M or T-90Ms. And I question of those late models are available in numbers and distrubution for form armoured mass.</p>\n</div>",

Sending them to Poland for repair doesn't seem feasible if they are in an intense offensive.\n\nAlso does anyone know the US stance on exporting tanks to Ukraine with DU inserts? I know they were willing to give it to Aus, but are they willing for it possibly end up in Russian hands? Because domestic Abrams have had DU inserts for quite a while, refitting with other armour might be unfeasible. \n\nAlso are Americans willing to give DU APFSDS or if they potentially do give Abrams will those have Tungsten rods?",

I don't doubt (especially since this was in Reuters) that some version of US officials warning Ukraine not too waste much men and material defending Bakhmut happened.\n\nUkraine is also indeed taking heavy casualties (up to 3 digits daily according to this: https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jan/20/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-expecting-strong-decisions-as-kyivs-allies-meet-in-germany?CMP=share_btn_tw&page=with%3Ablock-63ca931e8f08475f7d94bf4b#block-63ca931e8f08475f7d94bf4b) holding the city, so this isn't bad advice America is giving. \n\nSo should Ukraine retreat?\n\nIf you look at a map of the frontlines, Bakhmut is almost this isolated salient, far from the twin fortresses of Slovyansk and Kramatorsk, where most of its current supplies transit through. Between the cities are a few roads, open fields, and small villages--hardly anything someone could say is defensible or indeed--worth extensive blood and treasure holding. On the flanks are the highly defensible Kostyantynivka to the left and Siversk to the right. And every soldier that doesn't die in Bakhmut is other soldier that can used for the offensive.\n\nSo I concur with the US official: Ukraine should pull out. All that's left is the timing and the doing. I wouldn't be surprised if Ukraine said fiercely 'no, never, we will never surrender' but then quietly pull out one night. Orderly retreats can quickly turn into anything but.\n\nOf course, we don't know what Ukraine has planned. Maybe there's some secret plan, some other purpose for staying in Bakhmut. Or, maybe there's the obvious reason: every inch of Ukrainian soil lost hurts everyone's moral, and the cost of blood is worth it for the land and chance to hold it.

From there you subtract losses, which come in two types: casualties and stop losses. Perhaps 100K+ casualties of the type where they haven't returned to the fight (dead and many of the wounded). Stop losses only apply to contract soldiers and Wagner; up until the mobilization was started, they were technically allowed to quit, and ostensibly many did despite pressure otherwise.

Then there are also those that were rotated out for whatever reason, probably a similar number, that also need to be subtracted.\n\nIn total I'd say it's probably around 300K, with wide error margins, and this would probably be close to parity with comparable frontline units in the Ukrainian armed forces (locally outnumbering them in some places, locally outnumbered in others). In the beginning it was easy to count the active brigades or BTGs and consider their usual combat ready manpower, but now it's much harder since the units have become way less standardized. Apparently they pretty much stopped using the BTG structure altogether. And I've heard of brigades attaching so many battalions that it would effectively make them divisions, and battalions that have taken so many losses that it would effectively make them companies; these units sort of lose their usual meaning as they take losses and reconstitute using ad hoc solutions.

And I&#39;ve heard of brigades attaching so many battalions that it would effectively make them divisions, and battalions that have taken so many losses that it would effectively make them companies; these units sort of lose their usual meaning as they take losses and reconstitute using ad hoc solutions. The traditional military hierarchies can get really messed up when they get cut up and sown back together like that.</p>\n</div>",

In the latter case, the process might very well be written into the peace agreement and enforced by Ukraine's international partners.\n\nThere's three main points.\n\n1) Many Russians will leave voluntarily. And Ukraine should facilitate that. If Russians want to live in Russia, well let them go to Russia then.\n\n2) Those who were residents of Crimea prior to 2014 should be given and are expected to be given permanent residency in Crimea. Or rather the legal situation be a continuation of pre-2014 situation.\n\n3) Those that arrived after 2014 are considered illegal immigrants.
