A lot of countries don't stockpile a realistic amount of ammo (esp. but not only precision guided ammo) for a major war.  At the rate claimed for Russian ammo use Russia will have problems sooner or later, the US and China would likely have problems as well.  \n\nI haven't seen any significant indication of a large amount of Ukrainian 152mm ammo being destroyed.  I have heard that a factory producing it was hit.  I don't know the results of that attack.  Whether production was bought back online or how much other production Ukraine might have.  Apparently Romania restarted production of 152mm to supply Ukraine, but I don't know their production level either. Ukraine won't run out of 152mm but they probably won't have enough to keep all their guns firing at a good steady rate.  That's why they have to transition to 155mm.  Hell of a time to do it.  Much better to change during peace time, but its not like Putin is going to give Ukraine that option.",

A lot of countries don&#39;t stockpile a realistic amount of ammo (esp. but not only precision guided ammo) for a major war.  At the rate claimed for Russian ammo use Russia will have problems sooner or later, the US and China would likely have problems as well.  </p>\n\n<p>I haven&#39;t seen any significant indication of a large amount of Ukrainian 152mm ammo being destroyed.  I have heard that a factory producing it was hit.  I don&#39;t know the results of that attack.  Whether production was bought back online or how much other production Ukraine might have.  Apparently Romania restarted production of 152mm to supply Ukraine, but I don&#39;t know their production level either. Ukraine won&#39;t run out of 152mm but they probably won&#39;t have enough to keep all their guns firing at a good steady rate.  That&#39;s why they have to transition to 155mm.  Hell of a time to do it.  Much better to change during peace time, but its not like Putin is going to give Ukraine that option.</p>\n</div>",

As far as the first point goes, they're mostly citing Girkin and another mil blogger, both of whom have been pretty staunchly \"make it a war\", I don't necessarily see a dramatic change in that rhetoric? Nor has Putin seemed to acknowledge or shift based on their insistence. Girkin, for example, is basically the apex grumbler in Russia right now when it comes to Ukraine and has been for some time and it doesn't appear that policy is influenced at all.  \n\n\nI'm curious about the annexation claims. It comes from US intelligence apparently, so that lends it weight, but Russia has been incredibly coy about Kherson in particular when it comes to annexation in the future. If I recall correctly, there have been players in Kherson calling for annexation from pretty much the moment Russia took the city, but Moscow has basically ignored them. I think it's very likely Luhansk and Donetsk are annexed come September, assuming the elections go off, but I have doubts about Kherson in particular because it is just too contested to ensure proper annexation.  \n\n\nRe: the nukes point, that's a theory the ISW expounded about two months ago I think (or somebody else did). That Russia would annex the territories in eastern Ukraine and use nukes as a threat to stave off counterattacks. All the counter-arguments against nuclear use you made stand. The truth of the matter is I think we'd only be talking about one territory, which is Kherson, really being at threat of reconquest. I doubt that Ukraine, even with Western backing, can muster the forces necessary to retake both Donetsk and Luhansk, the fighting would be atrociously costly.",

When the Popasna-Mykolaivka axis met up with the Nyzhnje-Toshkivka axis, that caused the Zolote encirclement, which not only unhinged the entire UAF defensive sector south of Lysychansk, it also cut the primary supply line to Lysychansk and threatened it with encirclement. That forced them to abandon all other positions east of Siversk and north of Lysychansk too as the loss of Lysychansk meant all their supply lines would be cut.\n\nSince Lysychansk fell and with the loss of half the total area of the Donbas salient within a week, it meant the Russian forces who had been manning the line from Siversk all the way around to Bakhmut had to move westwards, with some having to move between 30-50 kilometers, depending on where there were in the line. Not only did the maneuver units have to move, but their supply lines had to move too, as well as artillery, which are positioned between 8-15 km of the front lines (based on RUSI reports). Their newly taken supply lines are a mess too, because they must cross the Donets despite most bridges at this point having been destroyed or heavily damaged. Without artillery or supplies the maneuver units can't attack, so they took an operational pause.\n\nHowever, that only accounts for half the Russian forces involved in this campaign. Everyone on the north side of the salient from the Izyum axis to Siversk didn't move because the UAF didn't retreat there. Likewise on the southern side of the salient from Avdiivka to Bakhmut, they didn't move either. Also, neither relied on a supply line that needed to be moved, nor did their artillery need to move.Which is why for the last couple weeks they've still been attacking using the same small scale ground probing TTPs they've been doing for months that have been working well, despite being slow.\n\nC2 strikes will need to be repeated to all brigade, division, corps, CAAs, and military districts to cause an operational pause. That will degrade performance and hurt morale but it's unlikely to outright cause a large campaign to pause unless a major hit occurred that wiped out most of the command and staff.\n\nIt's a different story losing large amounts of artillery shells stored in ammo supply points (ASP) that are being hit by a dedicated UAF campaign, which can cause tactical pauses especially and even smaller scale operational pauses too. While the rear area strikes being hyped are in all of Ukraine and not just in the Donbas, they have definitely affected the Donbas areas. With large artillery ASP being situated down to the brigade level, if those get hit then the unit who relied on them are either out of ammo temporarily or limited, depending on how much ammo was lost. So if a brigade was planning an attack, they might have to delay or cancel it until they get more ammo. Similarly for division level as well as the ASP in the operational rear that belong to corps, CAAs, and military districts. If those are hit, planned operations their subunits were slated to perform might need to be delayed or cancelled until they get the ammo they need. Or the plans are rewritten with fewer arty rounds allocated.\n\nWhich is great news for the UAF, Russian troops have suffered serious degradation of their tactical ground combat abilities, without lots of artillery support they will have incredible difficulties conducting successful attacks if the UAF goes out of their way to hold ground as fiercely as they have been.",

SMH.\n\nThis is such a disappointing post. First, the primary point of my post was that Ukraine is not stable, which captures your issues here, especially the corruption one. But no, you take issue with the term promising, which specifically describes situations where the present is disappointing but there is reason to believe the future will be better. And then you utterly fail to address whether or not the future will be better, instead looking entirely to the past.\n\nAnd the Revolution of Dignity complaint is such a joke. Here's Ukraine, with a history of suffering under Russian colonialism. They're ruled by a Russian puppet. They get rid of the Russian puppet, who promptly eliminates all doubt he was a Russian puppet by fleeing to Russia, who promptly invades, and has kept him sitting around all this time waiting for a chance to restore him to power.\n\nIn the meantime, Ukraine has been on a steady trajectory towards more democracy and more expression of the will of the people. Zelenskyy's election is a great example of that - he was the soft on Russia alternative. He was out of step with the folks who took power immediately after the revolution. His election and the peaceful transfer of power demonstrates the legitimacy of the Ukrainian government, and that they aren't holding sham elections or appointing figureheads from the shadows. We should expect to see more diversity of opinions from future Ukrainian leaders, because that's what democracy looks like.\n\nAnd I would hope the fake opposition parties get banned. Imagine complaining about banning Russian infiltrators from the government. The real opposition parties, like Solidarity, are of course doing just fine.",

The US&#39;s actions in Chile (I am not denying they were destabilizing the country, I just deny their involvement specifically in Pinochet&#39;s coup) we&#39;re completely negligible compared to the grave destabilization of the political, economic, legal, and social order of Chile that was committed by Allende in his attacks on the constitution, the rule of law, and the separation of powers.</p>\n</div>",
