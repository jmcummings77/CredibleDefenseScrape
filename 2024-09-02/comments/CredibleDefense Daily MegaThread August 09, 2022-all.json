The strike today on Crimea was doubtless important militarily (we'll have a better idea of that aspect when get an actual reliable estimation of destroyed aircraft/casualties), but I think the most important aspect was the propaganda value and Ukraine knows it. Photos of two giant plumes of smoke rising up over a Russian holiday beach are tailor-made for propaganda purposes and it wouldn't surprise me if the target was picked partly because of that potential proximity. It demonstrates to the Russian people that their government cannot guarantee their safety in supposedly safe areas, it shows the Ukrainian people that its government is taking revenge/fighting back in a big way, and it shows the rest of the world that Ukraine is not cowed and has some serious bite left. It's far more sellable than grinding attrition along the front, the occasional bridge strike near Kherson, or some drone footage. Just look at the sheer amount of buzz this Crimea strike has generated on social media both in the West and in Russia itself. Zelensky immediately following up with statements about retaking Crimea just adds to the frenzy. I think it goes on a list with two other big propaganda strikes: The Belgorod helicopter raid and turning the Moskva into a sea-floor research vessel. None of these attacks have been some sort of knock-out blow, arguably they have not shifted the course of the war in a meaningful way, and they have never been repeated, but the propaganda value is massive. Among Western audiences, the pro-Ukrainian discourse they generate alone is worth it. I am genuinely curious what the next propaganda strike will be and where it will fall.",

That might be weeks later. Then another platoon or company sized probe is sent forward, rinse and repeat.\n\nBecause the drones and arty are doing most of the work, the ground troops can suck, they only need to be good enough to draw enemy fire and retreat afterwards. Because they're typically not actually hoping to overrun the enemy with an aggressive assault, they can move very cautiously and still do their jobs without heavy losses (though its likely they lose an AFV every probe). \n\nOverall, RUK is very slow and extremely costly in artillery ammunition, but if they have very secure supply lines and their drones can operate, it can work pretty well.",

        "body": "[The latest ISW update](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-august-9) seems enthused about a possible Ukrainian counteroffensive toward Izyum:\n\n> * **Western media has reported that a Ukrainian counteroffensive is underway near Izyum, but the Ukrainian General Staff was notably completely silent about the area in its evening report.**\n* **Russian sources suggested that recently-formed volunteer battalions are responsible for much of the Izyum sector.**\n\nFrom what I have read, [here](https://twitter.com/DefMon3/status/1555513448506736640) and elsewhere, the Russians have concentrated the bulk of their operational reserves in the stretch of the Crimean land bridge east of the Dnieper and west of Melitopol, where they are under reasonably heavy attack by Ukrainian MLRS and PGMs, Grads and HIMARS mostly. [FIRMS fire data seems to lend credence to that assessment, given the region has the largest concentration of thermal anomalies over the past few weeks](https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/map/#t:adv;d:2022-08-04..2022-08-10;l:noaa20-viirs,viirs,modis_a,modis_t,countries;@35.2,46.1,8z). \n\nI suspect the number of BTGs concentrated there can partially be attributed to a good, old-fashioned traffic jam as the Russians try pushing reinforcements across the Dnieper to Northern Kherson Oblast, in what I like to think of as *Kyiv Convoy 2: HydroElectric Boogaloo, HIMARSway to Hell Edition*. Then presumably there are some units resting and refitting, and others ready to be cycled into combat, and others irresponsibly piling weaponry up around nuclear power plants and other such classic Russian shenanigans. But the farther east and north you go, the Russians start to look spread pretty thin. That's probably why most of the their offensive operations reported today consisted of limited reconnaissance or scouting missions that were apparently easy to repel. \n\nIf ISW's assessment is accurate, there is now a counteroffensive aimed directly at a bunch of green recruits (dare I say, the new `little green men`?) dangling on the Russian flank far away from reinforcements. Meaning Russia is probably going to have to shift reserves from somewhere, assuming the Ukrainians are able to make at least some progress. If the Russians do have to shift reserves, [they are at an extreme positional disadvatange](https://twitter.com/DefMon3/status/1555530076061573121/photo/1).  It's a long damn way from Melitopol to Izyum, especially having to travel so close to the front, within HIMARS and Russian cigarette range. \n\nThat suggests to me that the next phase of the war will feature Ukrainian counteroffensives pivoting back and forth between the south to the north, biting off little chunks at a time. The Russians will be forced to shift their reserves back and forth in turn, but along a much longer set of GLOCs. GLOCs which are increasingly subject to uncontested interdiction by Ukrainian artillery, PGMs, and possibly even aviation, if the Ukrainians continue their recent progress targeting Russian SAM units and graciously allowing the Russians to blow up their own airbases with misplaced tobacco products. Coincidentally, this strategy will literally force the Russians to run around in a rough U shape. Just a little bonus humiliation, I guess. \n\nEventually that will wear the Russians down, and those little chunks Ukraine bites off will turn into bigger and bigger chunks. I struggle to see what options the Russians have left to reverse that trajectory, beyond extreme escalation or delaying tactics that won't even buy them enough time to put Europe through a tough winter to test western support. They're rapidly losing their limited air superiority, their artillery is finally outranged and outclassed, and starting to starve for ammo. The entirety of their GLOCs over Ukrainian territory are now under threat of attack, except perhaps some parts of eastern Crimea. They have limited remaining operational tanks, which have only been deployed with dubious effectiveness thus far anyway, even under far more favorable battlefield conditions. In no small part due to their never ending dearth of combat ready infantry. Their most useful weapons are their rapidly dwindling stocks of PGMs, which they can't produce at anywhere near their current expenditure rates, even under the most wildly optimistic set of assumptions and without considering the effectiveness of sanctions on disrupting their supply of western components. \n\nAnd their increasingly desperate tactics seem to reflect that reality. There's no other way to characterize using a nuclear power plant as a shield. It's not the move you make when you have a dozen cards up your sleeve. It's more of an \"escaped convict cornered by police takes a hostage because a murder-suicide-by-cop is better than going back up the river\" type of move. I just hope they don't kill the hostage.",

Because the Izyum western flank would otherwise be a quiet area (it&#39;s outside of the salient) it&#39;s garrisoned by weak forces who hold an extended line, which is why the UAF keeps throwing mech infantry brigades at it, they&#39;re attacking a weak point. When it reinforces, they back off, wait a little bit for Russians to move the reserves away, and then they do it again. And again. And again.</p>\n</div>",

            "body": "Eh, this is a real big split frankly across the defence and policy community. If you've spent any time in Washington you'll see a real reluctance to acknowledge how American actions could be perceived as provocative or escalatory - in general I'd even go so far to say as some on this sub will never acknowledge how American behaviour may explain an adversaries response - that response is always grounded in some cultural or ideological predilection for dominance or predatory behaviour or something of the sort.\n\nOn the flipside, you have a real group of people who view everything China does as a justified \"response\" and everything we do as a \"provocation\" even if it's *the exact same action.* \n\n*Now,* let me be clear: not all escalations are bad and not all provocations are unjustified depending on the goals and objectives of an escalation (e.g., are you escalating to de-escalate? Provoking to probe an enemy response? Escalating to establish strategic clarity over a previously ambiguous relationship?). \n\nThe Quincy Institute (not my favourite group) had an interesting report on this exact subject re: Taiwan and the broader Asian strategy, namely:\n\n>Efforts by the United States to restore military dominance in the region through offensive strategies of control are unlikely to succeed. Not only would such efforts prove financially unsustainable; they could also backfire by exacerbating the risk of crises, conflict, and rapid escalation in a war.\n\n[link](https://quincyinst.org/report/active-denial-a-roadmap-to-a-more-effective-stabilizing-and-sustainable-u-s-defense-strategy-in-asia/).\n\nThis is becoming tangential but fundamentally it comes down to a reluctance to acknowledge that the West has interests in Ukraine and Taiwan that are real and entrenched, and so do Russia and China (respectively). How do we resolve that security dilemma? That's the more interesting conversation. I often tell my students to ask themselves to \"game-it-out\" from the adversaries perspective, and then at the end of the exercise to ask themselves \"was anything my team did unjustified? Did I do anything that was needlessly provocative or escalatory that did not achieve an outcome? Which unintended outcomes did you not predict?\" Great way to teach game theory, terrible way to make friends.",

If you&#39;ve spent any time in Washington you&#39;ll see a real reluctance to acknowledge how American actions could be perceived as provocative or escalatory - in general I&#39;d even go so far to say as some on this sub will never acknowledge how American behaviour may explain an adversaries response - that response is always grounded in some cultural or ideological predilection for dominance or predatory behaviour or something of the sort.</p>\n\n<p>On the flipside, you have a real group of people who view everything China does as a justified &quot;response&quot; and everything we do as a &quot;provocation&quot; even if it&#39;s <em>the exact same action.</em> </p>\n\n<p><em>Now,</em> let me be clear: not all escalations are bad and not all provocations are unjustified depending on the goals and objectives of an escalation (e.g., are you escalating to de-escalate? Provoking to probe an enemy response? Escalating to establish strategic clarity over a previously ambiguous relationship?). </p>\n\n<p>The Quincy Institute (not my favourite group) had an interesting report on this exact subject re: Taiwan and the broader Asian strategy, namely:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Efforts by the United States to restore military dominance in the region through offensive strategies of control are unlikely to succeed. Not only would such efforts prove financially unsustainable; they could also backfire by exacerbating the risk of crises, conflict, and rapid escalation in a war.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://quincyinst.org/report/active-denial-a-roadmap-to-a-more-effective-stabilizing-and-sustainable-u-s-defense-strategy-in-asia/\">link</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This is becoming tangential but fundamentally it comes down to a reluctance to acknowledge that the West has interests in Ukraine and Taiwan that are real and entrenched, and so do Russia and China (respectively). How do we resolve that security dilemma? That&#39;s the more interesting conversation. I often tell my students to ask themselves to &quot;game-it-out&quot; from the adversaries perspective, and then at the end of the exercise to ask themselves &quot;was anything my team did unjustified? Did I do anything that was needlessly provocative or escalatory that did not achieve an outcome? Which unintended outcomes did you not predict?&quot; Great way to teach game theory, terrible way to make friends.</p>\n</div>",

Surely I don't contend to argue that Putin is the expression of the will of his nation, nor that what he is doing is within Russia's self-interest (although I have seen this argument made based on a narrow reading of Russia's interests). \n\nWhat I am trying to say is that nations often find that a great many things can be justified on a moral basis regardless of our own perspective or understanding (which I suppose is just a way of saying that morality is subjective). To conduct an analysis therefore that says \"a nation shouldn't do X because we think X is morally wrong\" is little more than a values statement even if we hold those values to be true and correct. \n\nI am not arguing that morals play no role in international affairs. What I'm saying is that the level oof morality practiced by nation states is *much much lower* than the level of morality practiced by individuals interacting between each other. The standard of moral behaviour between nations is so much lower than the standard of moral behaviour between peoples that it becomes a poor predictive and analytical tool to help explain *why* a nation might undertake a variety of actions and so it's more helpful to defer to sets of \"national interests.\" \n\nI agree that this war is *not turning out to be in Russia's best interests* but that has much to do with the uncertainty of outcomes in war and its relative unpredictability. For example, had Putin's plan somehow worked and the Zelensky government folded and Ukraine been absorbed or turned into some form of Russian puppet for relatively low marginal cost (in both lives and additional sanctions) I think you would see numerous headlines in the Western press talking about how Putin has \"won a victory for himself and Russia.\" \n\nA final point; however, is that we are often very *bad* at determining what, exactly is in another nations best interests because (frankly) we don't live there. Your post basically says that Russia should just become any other European country with a liberal democratic system of governance and modern economy. Perhaps this is true (after all, these systems have the highest quality of life by any conceivable metric). But let us take another example, perhaps the Sentinelese? Surely they would be \"better off\" with a liberal system of governance, modern healthcare, modern education, and something beyond a hunter-gatherer economy? I think most would view that as a form of cultural imperialism (and rightly so). The road to interest is more fraught than you might think.",

For example, had Putin&#39;s plan somehow worked and the Zelensky government folded and Ukraine been absorbed or turned into some form of Russian puppet for relatively low marginal cost (in both lives and additional sanctions) I think you would see numerous headlines in the Western press talking about how Putin has &quot;won a victory for himself and Russia.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>A final point; however, is that we are often very <em>bad</em> at determining what, exactly is in another nations best interests because (frankly) we don&#39;t live there. Your post basically says that Russia should just become any other European country with a liberal democratic system of governance and modern economy. Perhaps this is true (after all, these systems have the highest quality of life by any conceivable metric). But let us take another example, perhaps the Sentinelese? Surely they would be &quot;better off&quot; with a liberal system of governance, modern healthcare, modern education, and something beyond a hunter-gatherer economy? I think most would view that as a form of cultural imperialism (and rightly so). The road to interest is more fraught than you might think.</p>\n</div>",

            "body": "I'll probably be slammed, but let me give you my honest perspective. Perhaps it will let you understand some people better (others are just trolls of course).\n\nI absolutely hate Putin. I hate that he attacked Ukraine. I wish the best for people there. But same as I'm more concerned about myself than say conflict in Yemen, I'm also more concerned about myself than anything else here. \n\nNot from an economic point of view, I'm not that selfish. But I'm very afraid of escalation. I had a very hard time in March not thinking about the possibility of the nuclear war all the time. Now it's better, but still, I'm worried of anything that feels like it brings such a possibility closer. \n\nInitially, I knew if Russia will conquer Ukraine, it will not stop there, so I knew we must support Ukraine militarily or else the conflict will just move elsewhere. I still believe we should support it, but to be completely honest, with Russian army now devastated and incapable of using its power elsewhere, I'd prefer this fight to stop with some sort of stalemate. Not because I wouldn't prefer a scenario were Ukraine wins completely, but because I'm afraid such a scenario (where for instance Crimea would become a battlefield) could bring nuclear war closer.

Perhaps it will let you understand some people better (others are just trolls of course).</p>\n\n<p>I absolutely hate Putin. I hate that he attacked Ukraine. I wish the best for people there.

        "body": "**Summary of Arestovych and Feygin broadcast from yesterday. Everything with a grain of salt, Arestovych isn't there to be completely honest or thorough.**\n\nKhakhiv was shelled once again. To the north west of the city the Russians attempt attacks, unsuccessful.\n\nOn the Izyum direction, the Russians attempted to attack Husarivka, again unsuccessful. According to some reports, the Ukrainians have liberated Dovhen\u2019ke. The Ukrainians are advancing on Izyum. A tactical encirclement of Russian troops is possible. Russian counterattacks yesterday failed. Arestovych highlights the importance of these offensive operations\n\nOn the Sviersk direction, continued unsuccessful Russian advances towards Serebrianka.\n\nBakhmut direction: Russians slowly closing in on Bakhmuts\u2019ke. Pokrovs\u2019ke has been captured by Russian troops. Advances towards Zaitseve. Difficult situation for us in this area around Kodema; a salient is forming and the enemy has advanced.\n\nAvdiivka to Mar\u2019inka direction: nearly no Russian troops in this area, only so-called DPR troops. Attacks north and south of Avdiivka in an attempt to surround the town. Attempted attacks on Pisky. Situation is Pisky constantly swinging back and forth. Large concentration of artillery in that area from both sides. No Russian advance. Arestovych remarks that the Russian \u201cglorious battle for Ukraine\u201d has been reduced to a battle for a cow farm on the outskirts of Pisky. Russian attempt to advance on Mari\u2019nka unsuccessful. Unsuccessful Russian counterattacks on the Vuhledar direction. Kherson direction\n\nMelitopol hit yesterday: 100+ Russian casualties, some officers.\n\nKherson direction: 3-4 BTGs of Russian VDV attempted an advance west of Snihurivka. We cannot say yet whether this is the main thrust of a Russian offensive or just a distraction. Arestovych believes that this is either a distraction or a probing attack. Attacks on Novohryhorivka, Russians are attempting to take the shortest route to Mykolaiv. Several BTGs brought over the river as reinforcements.\n\nAt least 4 S-300 and 2 Pantsir Russian AA systems have been destroyed by the Ukrainian air force in Kherson oblast using newly supplied missiles. Antonovsky bridge was hit during the night and is now heavy vehicles cannot use the bridge. Several storage depots have been destroyed in Davydiv Brid, Beryslav, Oleshky and so on.\n\nZaporizhzhia nuclear power station: Arestovych remarks that the country who lived through Chernobyl would not shell a nuclear power station on their own territory. Arestovych believes that the Russian threat to blow up the power station is a Russian blackmail attempt to force the Ukrainians to negotiate. Ukraine will not negotiate. Arestovych believes that the Russians will not blow up the power station. Some sanctions may be imposed on Russia in the nuclear sector in response to these threats. Other\n\nZaporozhzhia referendum: Arestovych believes this is another blackmail attempt. Russians fear a Ukrainian offensive in Zaporozhzhia more than one in Kherson.\n\nWeapons package: Arestovych implies that NASAMS systems are already in Ukraine. Ukraine will continue to receive shipments of anti radiation missiles. A billion dollars \\[the value of the weapons shipment\\] is a lot, this will undoubtedly have an effect on the battlefield.\n\nRussian casualties: Feygin brings up Pentagon 70-80k Russian casualties figure and comments that this appears to make AFU claims of 40k Russians killed credible. Arestovych notes that the Russians have an unusually high killed:wounded ratio as a result of poor medical assistance. He also says that L/DPR and Wagner casualties are not counted here. Russian units are reinforced with L/DPR conscripts.\n\nAnother wave of mobilisation has taken place in the L/DPR. People have been executed for refusing mobilisation. Arestovych says this is a tragic situation because Putin is forcing Ukrainians to go kill other Ukrainians.\n\nErdogan-Putin summit Kadyrov was not included in the meeting despite Putin\u2019s wishes. Arestovych says that many in the west are unhappy with Turkiye\u2019s  politics because of their undermining of NATO\u2019s united front against Russia. Arestovych says there will be consequences for Turkiye. Perhaps these actions will take place behind closed doors. So far Turkiye is the main beneficiary from this situation \\[the war\\].",

Arestovych remarks that the Russian \u201cglorious battle for Ukraine\u201d has been reduced to a battle for a cow farm on the outskirts of Pisky. Russian attempt to advance on Mari\u2019nka unsuccessful. Unsuccessful Russian counterattacks on the Vuhledar direction. Kherson direction</p>\n\n<p>Melitopol hit yesterday: 100+ Russian casualties, some officers.</p>\n\n<p>Kherson direction: 3-4 BTGs of Russian VDV attempted an advance west of Snihurivka. We cannot say yet whether this is the main thrust of a Russian offensive or just a distraction. Arestovych believes that this is either a distraction or a probing attack. Attacks on Novohryhorivka, Russians are attempting to take the shortest route to Mykolaiv. Several BTGs brought over the river as reinforcements.</p>\n\n<p>At least 4 S-300 and 2 Pantsir Russian AA systems have been destroyed by the Ukrainian air force in Kherson oblast using newly supplied missiles. Antonovsky bridge was hit during the night and is now heavy vehicles cannot use the bridge. Several storage depots have been destroyed in Davydiv Brid, Beryslav, Oleshky and so on.</p>\n\n<p>Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station: Arestovych remarks that the country who lived through Chernobyl would not shell a nuclear power station on their own territory. Arestovych believes that the Russian threat to blow up the power station is a Russian blackmail attempt to force the Ukrainians to negotiate. Ukraine will not negotiate. Arestovych believes that the Russians will not blow up the power station. Some sanctions may be imposed on Russia in the nuclear sector in response to these threats. Other</p>\n\n<p>Zaporozhzhia referendum: Arestovych believes this is another blackmail attempt. Russians fear a Ukrainian offensive in Zaporozhzhia more than one in Kherson.</p>\n\n<p>Weapons package: Arestovych implies that NASAMS systems are already in Ukraine. Ukraine will continue to receive shipments of anti radiation missiles. A billion dollars [the value of the weapons shipment] is a lot, this will undoubtedly have an effect on the battlefield.</p>\n\n<p>Russian casualties: Feygin brings up Pentagon 70-80k Russian casualties figure and comments that this appears to make AFU claims of 40k Russians killed credible. Arestovych notes that the Russians have an unusually high killed:wounded ratio as a result of poor medical assistance. He also says that L/DPR and Wagner casualties are not counted here. Russian units are reinforced with L/DPR conscripts.</p>\n\n<p>Another wave of mobilisation has taken place in the L/DPR. People have been executed for refusing mobilisation. Arestovych says this is a tragic situation because Putin is forcing Ukrainians to go kill other Ukrainians.</p>\n\n<p>Erdogan-Putin summit Kadyrov was not included in the meeting despite Putin\u2019s wishes. Arestovych says that many in the west are unhappy with Turkiye\u2019s  politics because of their undermining of NATO\u2019s united front against Russia. Arestovych says there will be consequences for Turkiye. Perhaps these actions will take place behind closed doors. So far Turkiye is the main beneficiary from this situation [the war].</p>\n</div>",

European intelligence officials who tracked the Sparta II say it carried military vehicles to bolster President\u00a0Vladimir Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine.\n\n> The ship\u2019s journey to the Black Sea port of Novorossiysk underlines the Kremlin\u2019s efforts to tap resources for the invasion that\u2019s now in its sixth month, as supply lines strain under the pressure of Europe\u2019s largest military campaign since World War II.\u00a0\n\n> While Ukraine has received billions of dollars of weapons from the US and Europe to help defend itself, Russia must rely on its own resources to support frontline forces amid reports of extensive losses. Tens of thousands of Russian troops have been killed or wounded and thousands of armored vehicles destroyed, according to US estimates.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> An official familiar with the matter said the US government believed Russia has been using merchant vessels to move military cargo to the Black Sea, echoing the European intelligence reports. The official asked not to be identified discussing confidential matters.\n\n> The Sparta II almost certainly brought military vehicles from Syria\u2019s Tartus port that\u2019s used by Russia, according to the intelligence officials and July 17-25 satellite imagery seen by Bloomberg. They said the exact nature of the vehicles was unclear. The ship was seen in Syria with vehicles in its hold, spotted crossing the Bosphorus Strait and later identified in Novorossiysk with at least 11 vehicles it was likely offloading.\u00a0\n\n> Maritime tracking data show the ship owned by a company the US sanctioned in May that\u2019s controlled by the Russian Defense Ministry\u00a0made the journey on those dates, apparently unhindered by NATO member Turkey.\u00a0\n\n> Ankara invoked the Montreux Convention to close the strait to warships soon after Putin\u2019s Feb. 24 invasion, though commercial shipping can pass through. Russia used cargo ships from the company, Oboronlogistika OOO, on the same route on other occasions this year, according to the people. It has ferried military cargo multiple times from Russia to Syria in the past.\n\n> A US State Department spokesperson referred queries on the matter to the Turkish government.\u00a0A Turkish official familiar with the issue said a merchant\u00a0ship\u00a0would\u00a0only be examined\u00a0if there was a tip-off or suspicion of wrongdoing. A White House spokesperson declined to comment on whether the US has\u00a0spoken with Turkish officials about the situation. The Kremlin and Oboronlogistika didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests to\u00a0comment.\n\n> To be sure, Russia built up massive stockpiles of armaments during a decade-long modernization program overseen by Putin, and Kremlin officials deny any resupply problems. Still, US and European officials\u00a0say the loss of\u00a0large numbers\u00a0of tanks and armored personnel carriers is forcing Moscow to dip into stocks of older equipment, including decades-old T-62 tanks.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n> Like Russia, Ukraine hasn\u2019t disclosed the scale of its military losses though it has faced logistical challenges against a much larger foe, particularly earlier\u00a0in the war. President\u00a0Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u00a0said in a July 22\u00a0interview\u00a0with the Wall Street Journal that battlefield casualties had fallen to about 30 per day from a high of 100-200 daily in May-June.\n\n> Russian shipments from Syria are likely feeding into its overall logistics as Novorossiysk is used to resupply bases in neighboring Crimea that Putin annexed in 2014, and from there to occupied Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in southern Ukraine, one of the European intelligence officials said. Russia has recently redeployed forces and equipment to the area as Ukraine threatens a counteroffensive in the Kherson region.\n\n> Russia moved a significant number of troops to Crimea in preparation for deployment in southern Ukraine and at least eight battalion tactical groups that comprise 800 to 1,000 soldiers were\u00a0moved from the eastern Donbas region, adding to pressure on its logistical supply routes, the person said.\u00a0\n\n> **Rather than a large-scale offensive, Ukraine may be seeking to lure Russian forces to the Kherson area where they\u2019ll be more vulnerable to attack**, Phillips O\u2019Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, said Aug. 7 on Twitter. \u201cMoreover, the supply issue for the Russians is far trickier with rivers where bridges can be severed and only a few heavy rail lines,\u201d he said.\n\nEdit: not sure why things aren\u2019t posting here in completion, but here\u2019s the full article:\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-09/russia-is-shopping-around-the-world-for-military-weapons-for-its-war-in-ukraine",

First of all, according to the [FT article](https://www.ft.com/content/8ed4ccdb-522a-4003-8010-1a786af18bbc), the Russian explanation goes as follows:\n\n> According to Transneft, Ukraine cut off the flow after a payment for transit fees was blocked because of problems related to the implementation of EU sanctions.\n\nSo according to Russia this isn\u2019t due to deliberate Russian action but rather to Ukraine shutting the pipeline down after not receiving payment, supposedly due to EU sanctions. \n\nNow, the question this brings up immediately is: why weren\u2019t these payments affected by EU sanctions before? I think there\u2019s actually a plausible explanation, namely that the payments were previously effected by Sberbank or one of the other banks that were only targeted in the [sixth round of sanctions](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_22_2802). Whether it would be possible for Russia to effectuate these payments through another bank is up for speculation (i believe it would be but again that\u2019s just speculation - it also depends on whether European banks are willing to touch Russian money even if it\u2019s technically legal) - so Russia could still be ultimately responsible for the cutoff.\n\nThis opens up other explanations. Them naming sanctions as the final technical reasons for the cutoff is probably aimed at undermining support for sanctions in the affected countries (this is plausible no matter whether or not sanctions are indeed responsible). Targeting Hungary (while naming sanctions as the reason instead of Russian malice) makes sense within this context because Hungary is the weak link within the European bloc - and contrary to popular belief, the sanctions are actually temporary and need regular [renewal](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/01/13/russia-eu-renews-economic-sanctions-over-the-situation-in-ukraine-for-further-six-months/) with unanimous approval from all heads of member states every six months. If Russia managed to turn Hungary against the sanctions, they would be gone by February. Similarly for example if the next Italian government, which will very likely be led by the post-fascist Brothers of Italy Party (I\u2018m not kidding they\u2019re legit the [successor party of Mussolini\u2018s fascist party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brothers_of_Italy) - although the line of succession is not as direct as it could be) opposes sanctions due to economic trouble Hungary could feel emboldened to oppose sanctions as well. Essentially it\u2019s the same rationale why Russia is cutting off gas supplies, the Russians rightfully hope they will benefit from the ensuing political chaos. \n\nBut that the Russians are now having to use oil to pressure Europe shows they\u2019re reaching the bottom of their leverage toolbox. Oil supply is very easy to substitute for European countries - like the FT article suggests, most of the Druzhba supply can be directly replaced by supply from other sources. The Russians in contrast will likely find it much more difficult to re-route the oil volumes they were previously exporting through the pipelines to other buyers. First off, the oil would very likely have to pass through ports and tankers, and this mode of transport is essentially already at capacity for Russia. Additionally, China and India are now absorbing lower quantities of oil than a few months ago because their storage and refinery facilities are at or near capacity, so Russia will have a hard time finding new buyers. \n\nAll in all i ultimately wouldn\u2019t worry too much about this though, gas is much more important.",

I think the answer is that Russia saw an advantage in helping Assad out militarily.

            "body": "Since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, Taiwan has received growing international attention as well, mostly because its situation between the U.S. and China is in some respects like that of Ukraine between the U.S. and Russia, and moreover, China\u2019s military threat against Taiwan is also in certain sense similar to Russia\u2019s threat against Ukraine. China has been striving for peaceful unification with Taiwan but will use force under the conditions specified by the Anti-Secession Law. While China\u2019s foreign policy, including its Taiwan policy, has become increasingly assertive with its rapidly rising economic and military power and popular nationalism, systematic studies of Chinese public support for armed unification with Taiwan have been lacking. Who are more likely to support armed unification? What factors and mechanisms contribute to their support? Answers to these basic empirical questions will benefit both academic and policy circles. In the following sections, we first briefly review Beijing\u2019s armed unification policy, present a novel survey question to find two types of support for armed unification, and introduce the 2019 nine-city cell phone survey; then we review relevant literature, based on which three types of possible contributing factors are proposed to develop hypotheses about which groups are more pro-armed unification. In the statistical analysis sections, the bivariate analysis of the survey data shows that generally the politically, economically, and socially privileged groups and those with stronger national pride and more understanding of Taiwan were more supportive of armed unification, while residents of the two coastal cities, Xiamen and Guangzhou, were less supportive; the multivariate analysis indicates education and unfavorable view of the Taiwanese government were the two most powerful factors contributing to the support. Possible contributing mechanisms might include both top-down mechanisms, such as political indoctrination and propaganda through education and media, and bottom-up ones, such as individuals\u2019 interest and identity considerations influenced by their city\u2019s geographic, economic, cultural and social distance to Taiwan. Finally, we discuss some implications of these findings.\n\nArmed Unification in Beijing\u2019s Taiwan Policy\nShortly before and after the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) in 1949, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) tried to unify Taiwan by force. Armed unification was thus the starting point of Beijing\u2019s Taiwan policy. In 1955, Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai proposed that \u201cthere are two possible ways for the Chinese people to solve the Taiwan issue, namely, war or peace; the Chinese people are willing to strive for a peaceful solution under possible conditions\u2019.1 However, the two decades or so that followed were marked by military conflicts between the two sides. China\u2019s shelling of Kinmen continued from 1958 till December 1978 when China and the United States issued a communiqu\u00e9 establishing diplomatic relations.\n\nAfter China kickstarted its reform and opening up, Taiwan\u2019s capital, talents and technologies entered China in large numbers, making important contributions to China\u2019s economic development. On the other hand, a rapidly rising China is working towards locking Taiwan in economic dependence to influence Taiwanese society and politics in the direction that is favourable to unification. Economic factors have thus played the most important role in cross-strait relations since the 1980s, favouring the economic development of China on the one hand and enabling China to achieve certain influence on Taiwanese society and politics on the other. The more than 40 years of reform have greatly transformed China\u2019s economy to become the second largest in the world. Economic success has greatly enhanced the confidence and pride of mainland Chinese. However, it is not enough to bring Taiwanese closer to China as increasingly more Taiwanese consider themselves as Taiwanese rather than Chinese and are hence more inclined to support Taiwan independence.\n\nTherefore, Beijing has never promised to abandon armed unification because peaceful unification does not seem guaranteed. Armed unification highlights Beijing\u2019s determination for unification, and from Beijing\u2019s perspective, is the ultimate guarantee that unification will eventually be achieved. Moreover, Beijing believes that without armed unification as a clear bottom line in its Taiwan policy, peaceful unification is even less likely to happen. Indeed, polls in Taiwan have indicated that support for Taiwan independence would greatly increase if China does not attack Taiwan after it declares independence.2 In Beijing\u2019s discourse on armed unification, force will be directed against the pro-independence Taiwanese minority and not against Taiwan compatriots who Beijing believes make up the majority. It will be implemented only under certain extreme conditions as specified in the Anti-Secession Law.\n\nAlthough armed unification has been an integral part of China\u2019s Taiwan policy, there is a lack of systematic research on Chinese public views of armed unification.3 For example, the basic empirical questions about this issue, such as who supports armed unification and what factors and mechanisms contribute to their support, have not been rigorously examined. This could be attributed to a popular belief that armed unification either will not happen or public opinions have no bearing on Beijing\u2019s policy of armed unification. With the rapidly changing trilateral relationship among China, the United States and Taiwan since 2016, and the increasingly important role of military factors in the trilateral game, the possibility of military conflict, be it accidental or otherwise, is on the rise. The Chinese public\u2019s attitude towards armed unification, as an important indication of Chinese popular nationalism, indirectly reflects society\u2019s willingness to support the government\u2019s use of military means in cross-strait conflicts. While some scholars argue that Chinese popular nationalism either has no increasing impact on foreign policy due to its insignificance or has been subjected to official nationalism because it is closely monitored and regulated by the government,4 some others argue that Chinese popular nationalism is a double-edged sword5 that Beijing uses to justify and serve its foreign policy on the one hand, but on the other hand, sometimes has to adjust the policy under its pressure.6 For example, in the studies of Chinese public and government reactions to the 1999 Belgrade bombing and the 2001 spy plane collision, scholars have found that the Chinese public\u2019s spontaneous protests and online responses complicated the situation, constrained Beijing\u2019s policy options, and prevented a quick solution in China\u2019s interest,7 and therefore, \u201cChina was equally constrained by public opinion in the two crises\u201d.8 Furthermore, even the U.S. showed \u201cthe concern and willingness to accommodate Chinese nationalism\u201d9 in handling these two issues with China. As summarized by Bell and Quek after reviewing relevant literature, \u201cChinese public preferences about the use of force could therefore have nontrivial implications for Chinese foreign policy\u201d.10\n\nIndeed, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has always believed that public support or opposition will determine outcomes of the war.11 As Mao Tse-tung said, \u201cthe outcome of a war is decided by the people\u201d.12 Concepts such as \u201cpeople\u2019s army\u201d and \u201cpeople\u2019s war\u201d have been created and passed down by the CCP leaders to emphasize the importance of people\u2019s role in warfare. Xi Jinping also declared that \u201cThe army wins by relying on the people\u201d.13 Therefore, public opinion has been valued by the Chinese government in its military decisions. As a long term Taiwanese expert on the cross-Strait relations noted, \u201cas long as Mainland Chinese people can maintain their friendship towards Taiwan, CCP will be hesitated to take any tough actions\u201d.14 On the other hand, an Chinese expert on the CCP believed that rising support for armed unification would constrain Beijing\u2019s policy options on the Taiwan issue.15",

China has been striving for peaceful unification with Taiwan but will use force under the conditions specified by the Anti-Secession Law. While China\u2019s foreign policy, including its Taiwan policy, has become increasingly assertive with its rapidly rising economic and military power and popular nationalism, systematic studies of Chinese public support for armed unification with Taiwan have been lacking. Who are more likely to support armed unification? What factors and mechanisms contribute to their support? Answers to these basic empirical questions will benefit both academic and policy circles. In the following sections, we first briefly review Beijing\u2019s armed unification policy, present a novel survey question to find two types of support for armed unification, and introduce the 2019 nine-city cell phone survey; then we review relevant literature, based on which three types of possible contributing factors are proposed to develop hypotheses about which groups are more pro-armed unification.

                "body": "A Survey to Find Two Types of Popular Support for Armed Unification\nThere are two types of popular support for armed unification in China. One supports the government\u2019s peaceful unification policy, including the option of armed unification under certain circumstances, and the decision of the government on the time and form of armed unification. The other is more radical and believes that peaceful unification policy is hopeless and will only make unification more challenging, while the conditions for armed unification, including China\u2019s military strength, are ripe for implementation at the earliest opportunity. This latter group of radical nationalists often criticise the government\u2019s current peaceful unification policy as too weak and ineffectual in curbing Taiwan\u2019s pro-independence forces, and nicknamed Beijing\u2019s Taiwan Affairs Office as a \u201cKneeling Taiwan Office\u201d (gui taiban \u8dea\u81fa\u8fa6).16\n\nExisting studies of Chinese public support for armed unification tend to observe the latter category of support, where the surveys in these studies consider armed and peaceful unification as two completely opposing options and respondents were asked to choose one of the two. For example, a survey asking the unification question with these two options found that only six per cent of the respondents in 10 Chinese major cities supported armed unification in 2013.17 The questioning method of pitting armed unification against peaceful unification may be able to identify those most radical nationalists, the second category described earlier, but not those who support Beijing\u2019s conditional armed unification policy, the first category. What was ignored was the conditional nature of armed unification in Beijing\u2019s Taiwan policy: Beijing\u2019s policy is peaceful unification but will enact armed unification under certain conditions, making armed and peaceful unification not completely opposed and mutually exclusive. This means that choosing only peaceful unification or only armed unification is not consistent with Beijing\u2019s Taiwan policy.\n\nTo find these two types of supporters, the Institute of Public Policy at South China University of Technology conducted a cell phone survey in nine Chinese major cities from March to September 2019 with the Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) system which generates random cell phone numbers and has been adopted by several studies of nationalism in China\u2019s major cities. The nine cities are Beijing, Shijiazhuang, Xi\u2019an, Wuhan, Chengdu, Nanning, Kunming, Guangzhou and Xiamen, with about 200 respondents in each city and 1729 in the total sample. The surveyors used gender- and age-quota sampling method with randomly generated cell phone numbers to make each city\u2019s sample representative in terms of the age and gender distributions.18 During the survey, the respondent was asked a question: Do you agree that Taiwan should not be unified with Mainland by force under any circumstances?19 If the respondent answered \u201cyes\u201d, it means she or he did not support armed unification at all and could even be opposing the government\u2019s conditional armed unification. Indeed, the Chinese government spokesperson\u2019s answer to this question would be a clear \u201cno\u2019. For the respondent, if her or his answer was \u2018no\u2019, it means she or he supported either the government\u2019s conditional armed unification as the last resort or armed unification at the earliest opportunity. Although the \u2018no\u2019 answers includes both types of support, they more strongly align with the government position on armed unification than the \u2018yes\u2019 answers, because the government\u2019s answer to this question would be \u2018no\u2019 too.20 The survey finds that 53.1% of the respondents supported armed unification and aligned with the government position on this issue, 39.1% opposed it, and finally, 7.8% gave an indecisive answer of \u2018don\u2019t know\u2019. To find what factors might contribute to the respondent\u2019s support for armed unification, social demographic, attitudinal and other information related to the Taiwan issue were also collected from the respondents during the survey.

Therefore, there might be comparability problems in using the existing literature to develop hypotheses about who are more likely to support armed unification. In other words, even if our findings are inconsistent with the existing ones, it does not necessarily mean that our findings challenge them because our dependent variable may not be comparable to theirs, although they might be correlated to some extent. Nevertheless, relevant literature provides clues for us to develop hypotheses and find possible causal mechanisms. We review the literatures around three topics: democratic countries\u2019 public opinion on their governments\u2019 military decisions against foreign countries, Chinese nationalism since China\u2019s reform and opening up, and Chinese public opinion on the government\u2019s military decisions in its foreign policy, including using force against Taiwan. Since the latter two groups of studies are more closely related to ours, we develop hypotheses mostly based on them, while the first group of studies may help us propose causal mechanisms behind the war support.\n\nThe literature on factors influencing public support for the government\u2019s military decisions in its foreign policy may be generally categorized into two subgroups. The first subgroup of studies focus on the characteristics of the war and warfare, while the second the characteristics of individuals. According to the first subgroup of studies, people tend to support wars against autocracies,21 those aiming to protect alliances or revenge,22 those having high stakes, low costs and a higher chance to win,23 those deemed as righteous,24 and those causing lower casualties.25 Among these factors, the cost factors at the collective/national level, such as financial cost and casualty, and some other ones, such as stakes of the conflict, chance to win and rightness of the war, provide useful clues for us to find causal mechanisms behind support for armed unification.\n\nAt the individual level, scholars find that gender,26 religion,27 media use,28 partisanship,29 political value30 and peers31 can shape individuals\u2019 opinion toward the state\u2019s military decision in foreign policy. Our study also takes into account individual characteristics, such as gender, media use, partisanship, and peers in developing hypotheses on who are more likely to support armed unification. Moreover, public opinion toward war and foreign policy are found to be formed through both top-down and bottom-up processes.32 Our study will also explore these two processes in explaining public opinion formation on the armed unification issue. Nevertheless, these findings about the characteristics of war, warfare and individuals are mostly from the studies of democracies, especially the U.S., and may be less applicable to China, the world\u2019s largest authoritarian country. In the following section, we develop hypotheses mainly based on the literature of Chinese nationalism and Chinese public opinion toward the government\u2019s military decisions in foreign policy. Our assumption is, as some studies have shown,33 that stronger nationalism causes higher support for the state\u2019s military actions in its foreign policy, such as armed unification.\n\nBased on these studies of China, we propose three sets of factors possibly correlating with support for armed unification. The first set of factors are social demographic and status factors, including gender, age, education, income, occupation, Hukou (household registration), Party membership, social activeness/sociability, and residence city/region.\n\n1. Gender. In general, men have been found to be more nationalistic and more pro-war than women in both democracies and non-democracies.34 Especially, Pan et al. find that the male respondents are more likely than the female to support armed unification in their 2013 ten Chinese cities survey.35 Therefore, we hypothesize that\n\nHypothesis 1. Men are more likely to support armed unification than women in the 2019 nine cities survey.\n\n2. Age. While some studies emphasize the stronger nationalism among Chinese younger generations,36 some others do not find the younger generations more nationalistic. Indeed, in the 2013 five Chinese cities survey Chubb finds that young people born after 1990 are less likely to favor military action in addressing the Diaoyu Islands and South China Sea disputes.37 Moreover, Tang and Darr\u2019s study indicates that the oldest generation of 59 years old or over, instead of the younger generations, are the most nationalistic in terms of national identity/pride.38 Zhong and Hwang\u2019s study also finds older urban Chinese are more nationalistic.39 The respondents in our survey are categorized into four age cohorts of 18\u201329, 30\u201349, 50\u201359, and 60 years old or over. We hypothesize that\n\nHypothesis 2. The youngest cohort aged 18\u201329 are less likely than older cohorts to support armed unification.\n\n3. Income and education. Pan and Xu find those with better education and higher income are less nationalistic.40 Tang and Darr also find that respondents with college degree and highest income are the least nationalistic. Similarly, Fang and Li find the negative effect of college education on respondents\u2019 support for the government\u2019s military action in dealing with territory disputes.41 But Zhong and Hwang find higher income earners are more nationalistic.42 Chubb\u2019s survey shows a more complex picture: while college graduates are less likely to support military action and higher income are negatively associated with support for military action, the middle-class respondents are more likely to agree with military action and to oppose compromise on the issues of the Diaoyu Islands and the South China Sea.43 Our survey categorizes all the respondents into six education levels with illiterate as the lowest and post-graduate education (i.e. master\u2019s degree or above) as the highest, and into five income levels based on the respondents\u2019 self-assessment.

Nevertheless, these findings about the characteristics of war, warfare and individuals are mostly from the studies of democracies, especially the U.S., and may be less applicable to China, the world\u2019s largest authoritarian country. In the following section, we develop hypotheses mainly based on the literature of Chinese nationalism and Chinese public opinion toward the government\u2019s military decisions in foreign policy. Our assumption is, as some studies have shown,33 that stronger nationalism causes higher support for the state\u2019s military actions in its foreign policy, such as armed unification.</p>\n\n<p>Based on these studies of China, we propose three sets of factors possibly correlating with support for armed unification. The first set of factors are social demographic and status factors, including gender, age, education, income, occupation, Hukou (household registration), Party membership, social activeness/sociability, and residence city/region.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Gender. In general, men have been found to be more nationalistic and more pro-war than women in both democracies and non-democracies.34 Especially, Pan et al. find that the male respondents are more likely than the female to support armed unification in their 2013 ten Chinese cities survey.35 Therefore, we hypothesize that</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Hypothesis 1. Men are more likely to support armed unification than women in the 2019 nine cities survey.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Age. While some studies emphasize the stronger nationalism among Chinese younger generations,36 some others do not find the younger generations more nationalistic. Indeed, in the 2013 five Chinese cities survey Chubb finds that young people born after 1990 are less likely to favor military action in addressing the Diaoyu Islands and South China Sea disputes.37 Moreover, Tang and Darr\u2019s study indicates that the oldest generation of 59 years old or over, instead of the younger generations, are the most nationalistic in terms of national identity/pride.38 Zhong and Hwang\u2019s study also finds older urban Chinese are more nationalistic.39 The respondents in our survey are categorized into four age cohorts of 18\u201329, 30\u201349, 50\u201359, and 60 years old or over. We hypothesize that</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Hypothesis 2. The youngest cohort aged 18\u201329 are less likely than older cohorts to support armed unification.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Income and education. Pan and Xu find those with better education and higher income are less nationalistic.40 Tang and Darr also find that respondents with college degree and highest income are the least nationalistic. Similarly, Fang and Li find the negative effect of college education on respondents\u2019 support for the government\u2019s military action in dealing with territory disputes.41 But Zhong and Hwang find higher income earners are more nationalistic.42 Chubb\u2019s survey shows a more complex picture: while college graduates are less likely to support military action and higher income are negatively associated with support for military action, the middle-class respondents are more likely to agree with military action and to oppose compromise on the issues of the Diaoyu Islands and the South China Sea.43 Our survey categorizes all the respondents into six education levels with illiterate as the lowest and post-graduate education (i.e. master\u2019s degree or above) as the highest, and into five income levels based on the respondents\u2019 self-assessment. We hypothesize that</li>\n</ol>\n</div>",

Tang and Darr\u2019s study finds the CCP members are more nationalistic than the non-members.44 However, in the 2009 surveys of Chinese university students, Gries et al finds that in Beijing the mass students are more nationalistic than the Party member students on Beijing\u2019s US policy, and in Guangzhou the former more nationalistic than the latter on historical beliefs.45 Because the Chinese government supports conditional armed unification and the Party members should be more likely to support the government position, we hypothesize that\n\nHypothesis 4. The Party members are more likely than the non-Party members to support armed unification.\n\n5. Hukou. Tang and Darr\u2019s study shows that migrants are more nationalistic than both urban and rural residents. The respondents in our survey are urban residents, but some of them have rural Hukou, suggesting they are migrants in the city. Therefore, we hypothesize that\n\nHypothesis 5. The rural Hukou holders in the cities are more likely than those with urban Hukou to support armed unification.\n\n6. Residence city/region. Pan and Xu, and Lan and Li find that the residents in the economically better developed provinces and the cities more open to the foreign market are less nationalistic.46 We divide the respondents into two categories based on the region where their cities are. One category includes the Guangzhou and Xiamen residents who are in the coastal regions nearer and more open to Taiwan, and the other category all the other seven cities\u2019 residents who are in inland regions farther and less open to Taiwan. We hypothesize that\n\nHypothesis 6. Guangzhou and Xiamen residents are less likely than those inland cities residents to support armed unification.\n\n7. Occupation and social activeness. We divide the respondents into two occupation categories: the privileged occupation including professionals, such as doctors, lawyers and engineers, and those working in the government or government affiliated institutes, and the ordinary occupation including all the others, such as workers, farmers, private business owners, students,47 and so on. Social activeness indicates how often (i.e. rarely, sometimes, or often) the respondents participate in peer gatherings, such as those with colleagues, friends, and former school classmates. As we have discussed previously, the existing studies generally suggest the privileged groups in China, such as those with better education, higher income, urban Hukou and living in the coastal regions, are less nationalistic. So, we hypothesize that\n\nHypothesis 7. Those in the privileged occupation and socially more active are less likely to support armed unification.\n\nIn summary, in terms of social demographic and status factors we follow the existing studies and hypothesize that the privileged social groups in China are less nationalistic, and as a result, less likely to support armed unification. On the other hand, we hypothesize that Party members, though usually seen as the politically privileged as well, are more likely to support armed unification as they are more likely to follow the government position on this issue.\n\nThe second set of variables indicate national pride, involving comparison between China and Taiwan in economy and politics. The survey asked the respondents which side was better in economic development and politics, respectively. Pan et al. find that the Chinese who believe their residence cities are more developed than Taipei are more likely to support armed unification.48 Different from their survey, our survey asked the respondents to compare Mainland with Taiwan, instead of comparing their cities with Taipei, and moreover, in two areas of economy and politics, instead of in economy only. Therefore, the respondents\u2019 answers to these two questions may indicate the level of their national pride, which has been found to be negatively associated with people\u2019s favourable views of other countries.49 Indirectly, as the previously discussed privilege factors, this national pride may also indicate a sense of privilege.

Specifically, the respondents were asked or checked whether they were interested in Taiwan news, knew who the incumbent Taiwan president was, had favorable or unfavorable view of Taiwanese government and society, and had in-person contact with Taiwanese.\n\nBoth the Chinese and Taiwanese governments believe that cross-Strait economic and social interactions may improve mutual understanding, reduce stereotypical perception and prejudice, and eventually, lead to better cross-Strait relations.50 Han et al. found in 2013 surveys that the Chinese who had been to Taiwan or were travelling in Taiwan were less pro-armed unification than those who had not been to Taiwan. Nevertheless, they were uncertain if the improved attitude towards Taiwan would remain amid fluctuating cross-Strait relations, especially after the DPP returned to power in 2016.51 Our survey could throw light on this issue as it was conducted in 2019 when cross-Strait tensions had lasted for about three years. On the other hand, Wang\u2019s study of the Chinese students who are studying in Taiwan\u2019s universities for degrees shows that most of them become less understanding or friendly toward Taiwan, suggesting that longer, deeper and more frequent contact with Taiwanese may not improve Chinese attitude toward Taiwan.52\n\nOur survey categorizes the respondents into three groups based on the level of their contact with Taiwanese: those having no in-person contact with Taiwanese, having in-person contact but without Taiwanese friends, and having both in-person contact and Taiwanese friends. We hypothesize that\n\nHypothesis 9.

Those having favorable view of the Taiwanese government and society are less likely to support armed unification.\n\nTo summarize, we hypothesize that more understanding of Taiwan, indicated by stronger interest in and more knowledge about Taiwan, in-person contact with Taiwanese, and favorable view of Taiwan reduce support for armed unification, as expected by some politicians and scholars.53 Table 2 summarizes all these factors/variables used in the examination.\n\nIn the following statistical analysis sections, we first use bivariate analysis with Chi-squared tests to illustrate which groups defined by the above three sets of factors are more likely to support armed unification. We then use logistic regression models to find factors that have independent effect on individuals\u2019 support and the most powerful contributing factors. Finally, we propose some causal mechanisms based on the findings from the models and the literature reviewed previously.\n\nBivariate Analysis: which Groups are More Pro-armed Unification?\nTo simplify the analysis, respondents who answered \u2018don\u2019t know\u2019 (7.8%) to the armed unification question were dropped from the sample. Table 3 summarizes the results of bivariate analysis with Chi-Square tests. As shown by the last row, 57.6% of the respondents are pro-armed unification and 42.4% anti-armed unification after dropping the \u2018don\u2019t know\u2019 answers. These two figures may be seen as the average/overall level of pro-armed unification and anti-armed unification in the nine cities, respectively. If the percentage of pro-armed unification respondents in an examined group is higher than 57.6%, this group may be seen as more pro-armed unification than the nine-city average.\n\nOverall, all these factors\u2019 simple correlations with support for armed unification are significant, except for age. Table 3 also shows that in addition to age, where support for armed unification between different age groups is not significantly different, our hypotheses about education, income, Hukou, occupation, sociability, in-person contact with Taiwanese, awareness of Tsai as Taiwan leader, and interested in Taiwan news are not supported either. Surprisingly, the findings about these factors support the opposite hypotheses. In summary, for the social demographic and status factors, the male, better educated, high incomers, Party members, those in privileged occupations or with urban Hukou, and the socially most active are more pro-armed unification; Guangzhou and Xiamen residents are less pro-armed unification than the inland cities residents. In other words, economic, political and social privileges might increase support for armed unification, which is opposite to our general hypothesis on privilege factors. For national pride factors, people believing China is better than Taiwan in economy and politics are more pro-armed unification, respectively, supporting our general hypothesis that national pride increases support for armed unification. For factors indicating understanding of Taiwan, those interested in Taiwan news, aware of Tsai as Taiwan leader and having in-person contact with Taiwanese are more pro-armed unification, which is opposite to our hypotheses that more understanding of Taiwan decreases support for armed unification; those with unfavorable view of Taiwanese government and society are more pro-armed unification, respectively, supporting our hypotheses.",

On the other hand, Guangzhou and Xiamen residents are 0.57 times less likely than inland residents to support armed unification.</p>\n\n<p>Interpretation of the Findings: what are the Mechanisms behind These Factors\u2019 Contribution to the War Support?\nWe propose the following four top-down and bottom-up mechanisms to deepen the understanding of the findings.</p>\n</div>",

Existing studies of Chinese education, media and nationalism find that the Chinese government\u2019s political indoctrination and propaganda through its education and media systems have been effective in cultivating nationalism and belief in the government strength, mobilizing government-allowed participation and support for government foreign policies, and so on.55 On the Taiwan issue, the political indoctrination and propaganda may have raised Chinese urbanites\u2019 national pride vis-\u00e0-vis Taiwan, belief in the rightness of the war against Taiwan and confidence in the victory, negative views of the Taiwanese president Tsai, government, and to a lesser extent, society, all contributing to higher support for armed unification.\n\n2. Interest and cost considerations, which may be influenced by both the top-down and bottom-up process of public opinion formation. Unification with Taiwan, according to the Chinese government\u2019s argument, is in China\u2019s national interest and will also bring great glory to the nation. The privileged groups may identify more strongly with this national interest and glory narrative, because they have benefited from China\u2019s rapid development both materially and psychologically more than others. On the other hand, the privileged groups may have stronger confidence in victory, making them underestimate various costs of armed unification, such as economic loss and casualty. As the existing studies previously reviewed suggest, belief in high stakes, low costs and a good chance to win may increase their support for armed unification.\n\nWhile this top-down narrative about national interest and glory may work well among inland city residents, the bottom-up considerations of interest and cost among Guangzhou and Xiamen residents may be able to resist its impact. A war with Taiwan will definitely cause more damages to these two cities due to their geographic and economic proximity to Taiwan, and especially, Guangdong and Fujian provinces have many Taiwanese businesses and closer economic ties with Taiwan. Such interest and cost considerations may dampen the two cities\u2019 residents\u2019 support for armed unification.\n\n3. Identity difference and similarity, which may also be influenced by both the top-down and bottom-up process of public opinion formation. The Chinese government has argued for a common Chinese national identity shared by both Chinese and Taiwanese, implying that most Taiwanese want unification with China. The Chinese public used to believe it, especially during the Ma Ying-jeou administration\u2019s first term of 2008\u20132012, when the cross-Strait relations were improving rapidly. Moreover, many Chinese used to believe that the Taiwanese who rejected the Chinese identity are the victims of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)\u2019s propaganda and pro-independence policies. However, Taiwan\u2019s anti-Beijing Sunflower movement in March 2014, which threw Beijing\u2019s unpopularity in Taiwan in the limelight, woke up many Chinese to realize that many Taiwanese resist any unification effort from China, be it carrot or stick, and Taiwanese identity grows significantly. The DPP\u2019s landslide victories in the 2014 local elections and the 2016 presidential and legislative elections further confirmed the estrangement. The significant change in Beijing\u2019s Taiwan policy from rapprochement to confrontation since 2016 have reinforced Chinese society\u2019s negative view of Taiwan, aggravated by the greatly increased Chinese media coverage of what Beijing believes are the DPP administration\u2019s pro-independence moves. The deteriorating cross-Strait relations since 2016 might have accentuated the perceived identity difference by the Chinese who had in-person contact with Taiwanese, which then increases their support for armed unification.56",

Most Taiwanese are the descendants of immigrants from Fujian and Guangdong provinces57 which are near Taiwan but far from Beijing. Compared to other provinces, Fujian and Guangdong share more cultural similarities with Taiwan, such as dialects, customs, and historical memories. The cultural similarities between the two provinces and Taiwan might be even higher than those between the two provinces and the seven inland provinces where the other seven surveyed cities are.58 The social connections between these two provinces and Taiwan have always been stronger than those between other provinces and Taiwan, as many residents of the two provinces still have relatives in Taiwan. In a sense, Taiwan seems to be outside the in-group boundary for most mainland Chinese. However, to the residents in Fujian and Guangdong, this in-group boundary might be vague, indicating the possibility of another shared identity with Taiwanese. Higher cultural similarities and stronger social ties might make Guangzhou and Xiamen residents more likely to see Taiwanese as part of an in-group, weakening their support for armed unification.\n\n4. Cognitive ability and confidence, which may also be cultivated by both the top-down and bottom-up process of public opinion formation. Armed unification is not an easy, evident and straightforward solution to the Taiwan issue, especially when the Taiwanese have been believed even by the Chinese government as part of the Chinese family with the same language and ancestors.59 As we have discussed previously, Beijing has to justify armed unification as an integral part of its Taiwan policy with pragmatic and rational arguments, which require certain level of cognitive ability to grasp and confidence to identify with. Similarly, it seems that our survey question, \u2018do you agree that Taiwan should not be unified with Mainland by force under any circumstances?\u2019, is not a straightforward question either, and as a result, also needs certain level of cognitive ability to thoroughly ponder it and confidence to say \u2018No, I don\u2019t agree.\u2019 The privileged populations, such as the better educated and the socially more active, might have higher cognitive ability to better understand Beijing\u2019s position on the issue and the survey question, and meanwhile, stronger confidence to express their disagreement with the non-official view in the survey. Their higher cognitive ability and confidence might derive from better education and more frequent social interactions, respectively.\n\nMore specifically, their better understanding of the government\u2019s position on armed unification might make them more likely to accept the government\u2019s argument about the importance of the unification for China\u2019s future development, such as significantly improving China\u2019s security and further strengthening its comprehensive power and international status. On the other hand, from Beijing\u2019s perspective an unconditionally peaceful Taiwan policy may encourage Taiwan to pursue de jure independence, which Beijing believes will have profound negative impacts on China. Our preliminary interviews with some urban, better educated, socially active Chinese who support armed unification show the way that they thought about this question. When they heard the question, they first asked what could happen if \u2018not using force under any circumstances\u2019 was Beijing\u2019s Taiwan policy. Then they immediately came up with some scenarios in which the Chinese top leader or China as a whole might be seriously threatened under this policy, indicating their high cognitive ability. For example, one interviewee said:\n\n\u2018If Xi Jinping promises not to use force under any circumstances, what if Taiwan really declares independence? If he cannot stop Taiwan from declaring independence, how can he remain in power? I guess 90% of the Chinese would take to the streets to protest and how can he still stay in power?\u2019\n\nAnother interviewee said:\n\n\u2018What if Taiwan attacks Mainland first? How can we not use force if they attack us first? I think we should take advantage of their attack as a good excuse to counterattack them and then get reunification!\u2019\n\nConclusion, Implication and Limitation\nWhen the survey was conducted in 2019 in nine Chinese major cities, the cross-Strait tensions had been escalating for about three years. Against this backdrop, while 53.1% of the respondents supported either the government\u2019s or more radical position on armed unification, 39.1% of them opposed armed unification completely. There might be different interpretations of these two figures. While some might emphasize that majority of the respondents still support armed unification, and therefore, Beijing cannot abandon conditional armed unification policy, some others may point out that since 39.1% of the respondents oppose it, Beijing has room to move gradually to an unconditional peace policy.\n\nThe bivariate analysis of the survey data shows that the relatively privileged groups and those with higher national pride and more understanding of Taiwan are more pro-armed unification. While some of these findings are unexpected, we do not suggest they clearly challenge existing studies\u2019 seemingly opposite findings, as our unique dependent variable might not be comparable to theirs. The multivariate analysis finds education and negative view of Taiwanese government are the two most powerful factors contributing to support for armed unification. Based on these findings and relevant literature, we propose four mechanisms behind these factors\u2019 contribution to armed unification support: political indoctrination and propaganda through education and media, interest and cost considerations, identity difference and similarity, and cognitive ability and confidence, which involve both the top-down and bottom-up processes of public opinion formation found in democracies.\n\nSince the Taiwan issue plays an important and unique role in Chinese nationalism and Chinese government\u2019s legitimacy, these findings may shed some light on both topics. The findings seem to suggest that the Chinese nationalism on the Taiwan issue is influenced by factors involving interest, identity and sentiment, such as national and local interest, national and local identity, and stronger or weaker sense of privilege, pride and confidence. These factors contribute to the public opinion toward armed unification through both the government-driven top-down process and the socially embedded bottom-up one. The powerful contribution of education and negative view of Taiwanese government to armed unification support seems to suggest that the Chinese government has played the most important role in cultivating Chinese nationalism against Taiwan through the top-down process of public opinion formation. Especially, the large effect of negative view of Taiwanese government may indicate that from the Chinese urbanites\u2019 perspective, armed unification is an issue mostly involving the Taiwanese government. Therefore, an effective way to improve the Chinese urbanites\u2019 support for armed unification is through increasing their negative view of the Taiwanese government, especially in comparison with the performance of the Chinese government/politics, which, as the findings of this study show, the Chinese government has been doing successfully.\n\nThe findings also suggest that the Chinese government seems effective in mobilizing public support for its conditional armed unification policy, as shown by majority support, and especially, by the higher support from the privileged groups who are politically, economically and socially more influential than other groups. This may also help us better understand why China\u2019s militant \u2018wolf warrior diplomacy\u2019 has been going on for so long, as it might have received the privileged groups\u2019 support too. However, from the perspective of audience cost theory,60 these privileged groups might turn into a source of audience cost in the future, when they realize that the government\u2019s conditional armed unification policy might be an empty threat. This may help explain why the Chinese government has been raising its military threat against Taiwan with increasingly frequent military exercises since 2016, as it needs to show to both Taiwan, the United States and domestic audience, especially those privileged groups who are more supportive of armed unification, that its armed unification policy is not an empty threat.\n\nWhile we have systematically examined the factors associated with support for armed unification, there are some limitations to our study. Firstly, the data from our nine-city survey may not represent China\u2019s whole population, especially its rural population, who might show different patterns in their support for armed unification. Secondly, our interpretation of the models\u2019 findings with four mechanisms is only suggestive and need to be further verified with more rigorous data and methods. Lastly, we did not examine the impact of the respondents\u2019 instrumental concerns about personal cost, such as loss of personal income and even life in the war, on the support for armed unification, which might be a significant deterring factor to war support.",

In every conflict small unit always take heavy casualties, rightly so, their job depends on it.

But that's the bane of a professional military, you train long serving troops but then lose them in a high intensity war without the ability to replace them. If the Russians do keep their hybrid manpower system along with an emphasis on a growing empowered NCO Corps it'll have to wait until this war is over to start regrowing.\n\nBut the NCO Corps was still very young and incomplete, especially outside of the better staffed units like the VDV. And even in those units they were still very much subordinate to junior officers, who also have taken extremely heavy casualties in this war due to a mix of culture that promotes bravery by leadership, willingness to take casualties, and their doctrine that often or always puts platoon to battalion commanders on point for advances mean they get hit a lot. \n\nThat wouldn't be an issue if they had a system to replace losses quickly. They don't.\n\nWhen it comes to junior officers, Russia has no OCS or rapid commissioning program, one attends a 4-5 year military academy and are trained to the level they're not supposed to need NCOs to fun their small units, the brand new junior lieutenants do everything, admin, planning, training, discipline, etc, while platoon NCOs help him but aren't delegated responsibilities like in many Western militaries. \n\nWhen it comes to company commanders and above, Russia has no \"up or out\" promotion system, officer pay is based not only on their rank and years in service but also their position (commanders get more pay then staff) as well as all sorts of other ways (which [applies to the enlisted too](https://www.armyupress.army.mil/portals/7/nco-journal/images/2019/March/Russian/military-pay-structure2.svg)).

But with a system like the Russian, it's not meant to handle attrition. Their \"best and brightest\" (and most ambitious, ruthless, and powerful) were already holding command slots when the war started. There aren't going to be many highly qualified officers to replace the ones lost. At a guess, considering the nature of this war, at this point most of the company leadership are likely casualties, a lot of the battalion commanders, and a good number of brigade and higher too, either killed or seriously wounded with a career ending injury. \n\nIt'll take the better part of a decade or more to fix that.
