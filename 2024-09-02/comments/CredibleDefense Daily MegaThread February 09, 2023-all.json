Has proven kills of at least 100km, which presents a real problem for them, even if it pales compared what it is advertised to be.

Says that western aircraft will not be an advantage, only level the playing field.  \n* Learning a new aircraft is only a small concern, learning entirely new weapons systems and entirely new tactics for their employment is much more significant\n* Says of the Su-57: There is some evidence of its use, but primarily in cruise missile strikes from within safe territory.  Notes that it was once a joint project between Russia and India, but India dropped out of the project and looked towards the Rafale, because the development was so troubled.

The Ukrainian Air Force lacks fire and forget missiles. They relied on the R-27 missiles, both the R-27ER and R-27ET, the R-27ET's range is 60 miles. The Ukrainian pilot must illuminate the Russian aircraft with their radar to guide the missile to the target. Russian pilots firing active radar, fire and forget, R-77 give the Russian pilots the ability to launch their missiles and then take evasive action. Ukrainian pilots were forced to \"exploit ground clutter and terrain-masking to get close enough to fire before being engaged\".\n\n> A report by the Royal United Services Institute states that in October some six R-37Ms were being fired at the Ukrainian Air Force a day. The Su-35S is also used as a carrier for the R-37M. Four MiG-31 were also deployed to Crimea.[citation needed]\n\n> In August Russian forces maintained a Combat Air Patrol of either a pair of Su-35S or MiG-31s on station to shoot down Ukrainian aircraft.

They have light infantry units, the TDF. If need be, just like the Russian VDV, they can always just leave their vehicles behind and do dismounted operations if necessary. \n\nThey also don't have a need to have a level of strategic mobility with rapid expeditionary forces like the US, UK, France, and a few other western countries, who have in the last half century needed to respond quickly moving large forces all around the world.

In the 1920-30s, many USMC officers fought in the Banana Wars in Central and South America, fighting barely or untrained rebels who couldn't shoot for shit and weren't very organized or brave. As a result, Marine officers got into habits where they shunned taking cover under fire, and often resorted to hasty and highly aggressive attacks that would nearly always dislodge the rebels. Then they went into WW2 with that mindset and expected their junior Marines to do it against the IJA, who were often pretty damn good shots, and who definitely didn't get scared off into running when US Marines attacked them. Resulting in VERY high casualties in certain units with USMC Banana War commanders (Chesty Puller was notorious). \n\nWhile experience is always great, like training its only value is when its quality experience. When learning, there are usually standards and lesson plans, with experience there are none unless there are After Action Reviews to go over what happened and how to learn from them, which are supposed to happen in combat too (US was bad about doing them outside of training, and I seriously doubt the Ukrainians do it). Without that, learning from experience is a purely individual effort, some are learning LOTS every time they fight. Some are going through the motions and learning nothing. Some think they are learning but actually learning bad lessons (I stuck my  head out four times and didn't get shot, I don't have to worry about sticking my head out anymore).",

According to Russian doctrine, an interstate war such as this one should <em>begin with weeks of air and missile attacks against an enemy\u2019s military and critical infrastructure</em> during what strategists call \u201cthe initial period of war.\u201d Russia\u2019s planners consider this the decisive period of warfare, with air force operations and missile strikes, lasting between four and six weeks, designed to erode the opposing country\u2019s military capabilities and capacity to resist. <em>According to Russia\u2019s theory, ground forces are typically deployed to secure objectives only after air forces and missile attacks have achieved many of their objectives</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Maybe this is why some Ukrainians were so vocal about a second large invasion coming, trusting the Russian will try to follow their doctrine over their capabilities.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe it&#39;s also a factor in why Surovikin was replaced, if he really was an advocate of a defensive strategy. More doctrinal elements could have believed that the conditions for a ground assault had been met.</p>\n</div>",

And I doubt it would be anything like the Desert Storm air campaign, especially since that wasn't actually designed specifically to support the ground campaign. \n\nOriginally it was pure strategic bombing, NOTHING they did was to involve striking the Iraqi forces in Kuwait but that got squashed. They wanted to take out all production, water, power, oil, etc. Totally destroy Iraq as a society to force Saddam to retreat from Kuwait without needing a land campaign.\n\nThat got scaled back a lot because even the fighter command generals (who were running the USAF) hated it. So about half of the air campaign was strategic, the other half to support the ground campaign, the hope was to attrit Iraqi units to 50%, especially the Republican Guard though they ended up barely touched.  But the hope even then was that the land campaign wouldn't be needed, that's why the strategic bombing piece remained in place and did quite a bit of damage.\n\nFunny enough, in 2022 Russia would probably have had a more successful air campaign as they had more long range PGMs. \"Smart bombs\" made up a tiny percentage of weapons used in 91, in fact barely any aircraft were even capable of guiding them (F117, F111, and single variant of F15). Russia had thousands of cruise missiles and ballistic missiles, they could have done a lot with those had they unleashed them in a coordinated manner, which they never really did until October, which was after most had been used up.

I think probably, because it wouldn't have been hard to stop Russia forced to drive mostly on roads due to weather.\n\nThat said, the Ukrainians would have had advanced notice of a ground invasion means the Russians would have too, and a full combat ready Russian invasion force is much different than what we saw.

Ukrainian officials say this process should give Washington confidence about providing Kyiv with longer-range weapons.\n\n>A senior U.S. official \u2014 who like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue \u2014 acknowledged the key American role in the campaign and said that the targeting assistance served to ensure accuracy and conserve limited stores of ammunition for maximum effectiveness. The official said that Ukraine does not seek approval from the United States on what to strike and routinely targets Russian forces on their own with other weapons. The U.S. provides coordinates and precise targeting information solely in an advisory role, the official said.\n\n>The GPS-guided strikes have driven Moscow\u2019s forces back on the battlefield and been celebrated as a key factor in Kyiv\u2019s underdog attempt to stave off the nearly year-old Russian assault. When President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the White House in December, he gave President Biden a military medal that had been approved for meritorious service by the commander of a Ukrainian HIMARS unit.\n\n>The issue is sensitive for the U.S. government, which has cast itself as a nonbelligerent friend to the government in Kyiv as it fights for its sovereignty and survival. The Kremlin has countered by repeatedly accusing the United States and its NATO allies of fighting a proxy war in Ukraine.\n\n>Senior Pentagon officials declined for days to answer questions about whether and how they provide coordinates for the strikes, citing concerns about operational security. They instead provided a statement highlighting the limitations of American involvement.\n\n>\u201cWe have long acknowledged that we share intelligence with Ukraine to assist them in defending their country against Russian aggression, and we have optimized over time how we share information to be able to support their requests and their targeting processes at improved speed and scale,\u201d Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder, a Pentagon spokesman, said in the statement. \u201cThe Ukrainians are responsible for finding targets, prioritizing them and then ultimately deciding which ones to engage. The U.S. does not approve targets, nor are we involved in the selection or engagement of targets.\u201d\n\n>The senior Ukrainian official described the targeting process, generally: Ukrainian military personnel identify targets they want to hit, and in which location, and that information is then sent up to senior commanders, who then relay the request to U.S. partners for more accurate coordinates. The Americans do not always provide the requested coordinates, the official said, in which case the Ukrainian troops do not fire.\n\n>Ukraine could carry out strikes without U.S. help but because Kyiv doesn\u2019t want to waste valuable ammunition and miss, it usually chooses not to strike without U.S. confirmation, the official said, adding that there are no complaints about the process.\n\n>For months now, the Ukrainian government has been lobbying Washington for longer-range precision weapons.\n\n>Kyiv currently possesses HIMARS launchers and a similar weapon, the M270 multiple-launch rocket system, each of which fire a U.S.-made rocket that can travel up to 50 miles.\n\n>Ukrainian officials also have sought the Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMS, a munition that can be fired from the same launcher and travel up to 185 miles. Biden administration officials have declined to provide that weapon, which is in limited supply and seen by senior U.S. officials as an escalation that could provoke Russia and drag the United States directly into the war.\n\n>Kyiv has pledged that it would not use the longer-range missile to strike across the border inside Russia.\n\n>The senior Ukrainian official contended that the Ukrainian military would face the same limitations it does now with conventional HIMARS rounds if they received ATACMS, with Ukraine still dependent on U.S. targeting coordinates.\n\n>\u201cYou\u2019re controlling every shot anyway, so when you say, \u2018We\u2019re afraid that you\u2019re going to use it for some other purposes,\u2019 well, we can\u2019t do it even if we want to,\u201d the senior official said.\n\n>The senior U.S. official disputed the characterization. It is \u201cnot true,\u201d the U.S. official said, that \u201cUkrainians run targets by us for approval.\u201d\nUkrainian military officials have said that Russian forces have moved back their ammunition stocks out of HIMARS range, which has led to a steep decline in the daily bombardment of Ukrainian cities and soldiers but also reduced Kyiv\u2019s ability to target Moscow\u2019s arsenal. With ATACMS, the Ukrainians would likely target Russian military installations in Crimea, which Russia invaded and annexed illegally in 2014.\n\n>The United States also recently approved the purchase and delivery of another GPS-guided munition, the ground-launched, small-diameter bomb, or GLSDB, that can travel more than 90 miles and be launched from HIMARS and similar launchers. The round was initially designed to be fired from aircraft, but has been repurposed.\n\n>The head of the Ukrainian military\u2019s missile forces and artillery training, Maj. Gen. Andriy Malinovsky, told The Washington Post in an interview in October that Ukraine\u2019s Western allies had confirmed coordinates for targets ahead of the Kharkiv counteroffensive.\n\n>The partners had worked out a process, he said, with Ukraine receiving precise coordinates to ensure they wouldn\u2019t miss their mark with multiple-launch rocket artillery systems as the rapid counteroffensive caught Russian forces unprepared. The targeting information also provided a workaround for when Russian signal-jamming prevented aerial drone reconnaissance on the battlefield, Malinovsky said.\n\n>\u201cAccording to our maps and software, a point will have one set of coordinates,\u201d Malinovsky said. \u201cBut when we give this target to partners for analysis, the coordinates are different.

Instead, the process, as described by the article, implies that any US assistance with targeting is always preceded by Ukraine&#39;s own intelligence gathering - with Ukraine identifying a target of interest first and on its own.</p>\n\n<p>I think Biden admin thinks this puts them in the clear as a non-belligerent.</p>\n</div>",

In fact Russia aims to increase social security by 12% in line with inflation(so no real increase, but no decrease either). What will fund the increase in security spending in 2023 is a combination of raising internal debt and a allocation of funds from the National Welfare fund. In addition, tax hikes on the energy sector(and potentially other sectors of the economy as well) is expected. However, this won\u2019t completely fund the budget, so Russia will run a deficit as well. However, that should not be a problem as Russia has one of the lowest rates of national debt in the world. In other words, Russia should be able to maintain their spending on social security while increasing their defence spending. \n\nAt the same time, it should be mentioned that the greatest threat to the Russian economy and state finances is the price of oil and other natural resources. The reason why is that the Russian state budget assumes a oil price of 75$ per barrel and oil accounts for roughly 40% of Russians exports.

We have an unprecedented amount of footage, but a lot of it is from flying drones which are engaged in some other task besides looking for tank battles.\n\nIf history is any indication, tanks destroy other tanks frequently but not predominantly. For example, in the western theater of WW2 something like 20-30% of tanks destroyed were by other tanks, but a similar amount were destroyed by mines. Presumably this general trend remains roughly true? I'm not sure.\n\nIf you try to put together what's going on through interviews, it sounds like a lot of tanks are distributed out to provide fire support. These do occasionally engage enemy tanks, but that was more common at the start of the war. Now it seems like they're more frequently throwing lots of HE-frag shells into troops hiding in tree-lines. \n\nFor example, [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTM5At2kYRw) from the summer tells us it's normal for Russians to probe lines with small units to draw fire from tanks, then try to subject them to artillery, rather than attempt any kind of direct-fire shoot-out. Presumably this is even more common today, given recent descriptions. But even so, one of the interviewed tank officers claimed his tank destroyed a dug-in Russian T-90 at some point.\n\nMore recent interviews like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNKHj3JNiYQ) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn_vfwNMa3k) show small handfuls of tanks (singles, pairs, not more than a platoon) providing indirect fire support like a kind of up-armored self-propelled artillery with drone or helicopter spotting. Sometimes at rates of 10 shells a minute, or with total expenditures of 50 or even 150 shells a day. One tanker said they are sometimes called to drive forward and provide direct support, but only against large attacks with many vehicles, which were pretty rare for a while there.\n\nSo I don't really have any clear cut statistics here, but here are my educated guesses:\n\n> What is the role of armor in static trench warfare? Do the sides keep them in the rear as a sort of QRF until an actual operation occurs? Are they dispersed amongst the front for fire support?\n\nYes and yes, especially acting as indirect fire support in small units that can convert rapidly into direct fire support.\n\n> What is constituting the majority of tank losses since the trenches have set in post invasion? ATGM? Artillery?\n\nATGMs, artillery, and mines seem like top influencers, but unguided AT rockets and tank guns probably aren't too far behind.\n\n> why is there so little tank on tank warfare?\n\nTank on tank warfare was always a minority historically, and I don't see any reason that would change. When it happens it's also probably under-reported in sources we have access to. Both sides also seem to be using tanks as fire support rather than using them to lead attacks, so without entering tank gun range there can't be any \"real\" tank fights.",

Are they dispersed amongst the front for fire support?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes and yes, especially acting as indirect fire support in small units that can convert rapidly into direct fire support.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>What is constituting the majority of tank losses since the trenches have set in post invasion? ATGM? Artillery?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>ATGMs, artillery, and mines seem like top influencers, but unguided AT rockets and tank guns probably aren&#39;t too far behind.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>why is there so little tank on tank warfare?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Tank on tank warfare was always a minority historically, and I don&#39;t see any reason that would change. When it happens it&#39;s also probably under-reported in sources we have access to. Both sides also seem to be using tanks as fire support rather than using them to lead attacks, so without entering tank gun range there can&#39;t be any &quot;real&quot; tank fights.</p>\n</div>",

But I wouldn't think that casualties is the biggest factor to \"can a country continue to fight\".\nLooking at modern war, WW1 both sides took huge casualties, a quick look at Wiki shows Germany and Russia at ~2 Million casualties, Austria Hungary and France at ~1 Million. While these losses certainly impacted their ability to fight, they still continued to fight for a sginificant time.\n  \nIn WW2 this was increased even more, in Germany it was ~5 million military deaths and Russia ~11 million. Despite these losses, neither nation surrendered (until Germany was essentially overrun).  \n  \nThis leads me to lean towards the idea that casualties aren't the biggest factor in a country willing to surrender. Rather it seems to me, when they lose the ability to fight is the key point.  \n  \nSo let's apply that idea to your question:\nAssuming you are talking about China, assuming that China is willing to take 30 million casualties into account, will the fighting even get to that point?  \n  \nCurrent military personnel is around 3 million. So this force would have to be destroyed 10 times over. I would assume by the time the first 3 million have been rendered casualties, the equipment lost would already be hard to replace. By the time you reach 9 million, equipment stockpiles would probably be exhausted with only very low tech equipment left over, essentially leaving them with a foot army, which works when you are defending your homeland, but doesn't bode well for offensive operations. Such a large army without vehicles would a) not move fast and b) not be able to resupply. Feeding a million people \"off the land\" will not help for long.  \n\nDuring this time, infrastructure would be attacked, meaning huge amounts of people in giant cities need feeding and taking care of.\n  \n\nTL;DR:\nSo in summary, I don't think that the \"30 million casualties\" upper bound would really be relevant. Such a war would be one of attrition and probably be decided by equipment losses, rather than casualties.",

Extrapolating from the stated crossings, Ukraine's report implies it crossed something like 5-10 km into the Romanian airspace. Romania says its closest approach was about 35 km away. And looking at the map in Roepcke's tweet based on the Moldovan report, Moldovans seem to have estimated the closest approach at 60-80 km from Romanian airspace. None of these are remotely compatible if we are to believe the radars are accurate.\n\nAre missile warning systems really that imprecise? Of the three, I would find Romania the most credible since theirs are at NATO standards and they have direct access to AWACS. Ukraine certainly has orders of magnitude better resources than Moldova, but they are further away and have an incentive to exaggerate. But these discrepancies between all three reports are so large that it kind of undermines my confidence in the state of modern air surveillance. Along with the drone and helicopter strikes deep into Russia, and the drone that crashed in Croatia early in the war.",

At that altitude, air density is 1/15 of what it is at sea level. The average wind speed at these levels is less than that at the surface.[citation needed] A propulsion system would allow the balloon to move into and maintain its position. The GBS would be powered with solar panels.\n\n>> A GBS could be used to provide broadband Internet access over a large area. Laser broadband would connect the GBS to the network, which could then provide a large area of coverage because of its wider line of sight over the curvature of the Earth and unimpeded Fresnel zone.\n\nThat unironically sounds like a great idea and something worthy of research.

        "body": "**Eight reasons why the US has no interest in pushing for peace in Ukraine**\n\nIt now appears that the US is not even remotely interested in supporting a peaceful resolution to the Ukrainian conflict, preferring to see the military campaign continue. Overall, strategic planning in Washington gives little thought to the parameters for ending the crisis: Whether Ukraine will remain within its current borders, lose its territories or disappear altogether. \n\nDespite mounting casualties and the destruction of Ukraine's military, appetite for military action has not diminished, neither in Kiev nor in Washington. Many international experts rightly identify the US as the key player in a large coalition advocating for continued hostilities in Ukraine. In less than a year of crisis, Kiev has exhausted its own military resources and the means to replace them, and is totally dependent on external assistance.\n\nThough the US is taking the lead in coordinating and strategizing support from the West, it would be wrong to equate Ukrainian and American interests. While continuing to pay lip service to Kiev's political demands, Washington is carefully assessing the right moment to initiate negotiations. The need for diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict has been increasingly emphasized by US military leaders, most notably the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley. The idea continues to circulate in the British press that the American tactic is to escalate the conflict in order to later de-escalate it: to pressure Russia with a wave of large-scale deliveries of military equipment and to put Kiev in a more favorable negotiating position. \n\nHowever, it cannot be overlooked that the continuation of the military crisis in Ukraine is in line with US military and political interests. There are a total of eight arguments suggesting that the Americans intend to prolong this conflict.\n\n**First**, there is the relative weakening of Russia, which has had to devote considerable resources to eliminating the military threat from Ukraine, as well as to achieving its political objectives of securing equal status in post-Cold War European security architecture. The Western media narrative that Russia is on the verge of defeat, while far from reality, gives the impression that all the West needs to do so is adopt a wait-and-see attitude. The lack of decisive Russian military victories leads to the perception that Ukraine is winning.\n\n**Second**, the US has a vested interest in breaking up EU-Russian energy cooperation. This has developed over many decades, beginning during the Cold War. The sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, apparently conducted with the assistance of another NATO state, was the culmination of a long-term American strategy to dismantle the extensive links between Moscow and key West European economies. The Americans want to shift European energy consumption away from Russia and create a more difficult environment for broader European industry, so that American goods face less competition, thus strengthening their own position.\n\n**Third**, the US wants to eliminate any impulse for strategic autonomy among EU states. The Ukrainian crisis provides a golden opportunity for this, as the US and its allies in Eastern Europe have managed to create a moment of moral panic in the information space, preventing any reflection on the causes and consequences of the crisis. Strategic decisions on arms transfers are being taken under pressure from the media and a radicalized section of the public, without any analysis of the consequences. Leaders and elites who might have been able to reflect with detachment and sobriety on the consequences of the slide of EU-Russia relations into a deep crisis, are now outnumbered and essentially voiceless.\n\n**Fourth**, the US does not want to see the defeat of Ukraine, into which much financial, political and symbolic capital has been invested over the past year. In the eyes of the West, Ukraine is its \"champion\". The old narrative of European civilization struggling against the barbaric East, going back to the days of ancient Greece and its confrontation with the Persian hordes, is being played out here. Ukraine's defeat would be a sensitive symbolic defeat for the West and would leave an \"open wound\" in the minds of many intellectuals. \n\n**Fifth**, the US has not retreated from the ideological imperative to defend what it interprets as \"freedom\". In the situation around Ukraine, there is a Manichean presentation of the struggle for \"freedom against unfreedom\". Washington also sees this ideological imperative manifest in the domestic situation in Ukraine, which of course is only possible if you look at the political processes in Kiev \"through your fingers\". By playing along with this narrative, Vladimir Zelensky's government seeks to present itself to the West in such ideological categories.\n\nThe **sixth** US objective is to encourage Western Europe to remilitarise. Washington is aware that prolonged military competition is not possible using American forces alone. Moreover, the US is conscious of the growing threat from China and realizes that its resources will soon be diverted to a confrontation in the Pacific. In the European theater, Washington is therefore looking for ways to strengthen the EU's military-industrial complex so that national defense budgets can be raised to at least 2 percent of GDP. \n\n**Seventh**, the US seeks to consolidate its European allies around a platform of fighting its \"rising\" adversaries such as Russia, China and Iran. Here, the US is trying to be resourceful in building coalitions willing to produce and sell expensive, high-tech weapons.\n\n**Eighth**, the US is also pursuing its own re-industrialisation through Ukraine. The expansion of the military-industrial complex is seen as an important goal for America. After the Cold War, it was reoriented to produce a limited number of high-tech products, whereas modern conventional warfare requires the large-scale production of relatively inexpensive generic artillery, tank and aircraft systems.\n\nAll this makes the US extremely uninterested in working for a peaceful solution to the conflict in the short term. The Americans believe that time is on their side and that the eight objectives listed above will be achieved. This makes their strategy rather flexible and demonstrates that their priority is to contain Russia rather than secure the future security and prosperity of Ukraine.",
