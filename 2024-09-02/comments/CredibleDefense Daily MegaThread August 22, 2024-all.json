Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

A lot of monolingual peeps might not be aware idk, but the overall situation with the Ukrainian grid is already really bad (the ICC wouldn\u2019t have issued indictments on a questionable technical basis if there wasn\u2019t significant, actual, and widespread harm to civilians), and it\u2019s been this way for months.\nAnd by the way, while the silent majority has been successfully massaged into apathy (for now), there is a vocal plurality of middle-aged and old people who will blame the Ukrainians, rather than Putin, for any woes that befall them.\n\n2) The thing a lot of people ignore in discussions of the support and supply situation is that Ukraine needs more than warm bodies and weapons to maintain organized resistance. Without massive blowback all around we can\u2019t do much to remedy Ukraine\u2019s issues with trained manpower. And I\u2019m not convinced the training efforts underway in countries like the UK are as effective as people think. And of course if Ukraine is going to set up corps and perhaps divisional staffs (as they are inching toward) those people have to be trained thoroughly too.\n\nSo with all this, I think it makes strategic sense to focus on imposing costs on Russia. The issue is that, this conflict being existential, the best chance of suasion lies in overthrowing Putin and his regime. Ukraine can\u2019t do this alone, and I don\u2019t think we here in the West should try to help because it would result in someone worse. For all his amoral kleptocracy, Putin is a mature adult compared to the kind of far-right figures who are far more prepared to take power than the anti-Putin camp.\n\nSpecifically, even before the captivity and death of Navalny the non-systemic opposition was not in a position to do much more than they were doing. And now, with the waves of emigration of the exact people who could have formed a mass anti-Putin movement, there is less of a potential support base than ever.\n\nWe also haven\u2019t seen Russian liberals taking up arms with Ukraine. On the contrary, the only people willing to exchange samovars and books for rifles and radios are those far-right figures who couldn\u2019t manage to quite fit in with Wagner and Rusich.\nUkraine should seek to change that. At this point, I see little reason for Ukraine not to explicitly pursue regime change. After all, that\u2019s Putin\u2019s declared goal with Ukraine. Because it\u2019s either concede territory, or double down. A middle course will fail, and the Kursk Oblast incursion, which is a form of doubling down, needs to become strategically justified.\n\nI know this is a little pessimistic as usual, but I think it represents plausible projections.",
                        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Two issues come up:</p>\n\n<p>1) While Ukraine can damage the fuel supply chain due to the lack of excess capacity, they haven\u2019t yet demonstrated the capability to do damage within the same order of magnitude to the overall grid as Russia is constantly inflicting. A lot of monolingual peeps might not be aware idk, but the overall situation with the Ukrainian grid is already really bad (the ICC wouldn\u2019t have issued indictments on a questionable technical basis if there wasn\u2019t significant, actual, and widespread harm to civilians), and it\u2019s been this way for months.\nAnd by the way, while the silent majority has been successfully massaged into apathy (for now), there is a vocal plurality of middle-aged and old people who will blame the Ukrainians, rather than Putin, for any woes that befall them.</p>\n\n<p>2) The thing a lot of people ignore in discussions of the support and supply situation is that Ukraine needs more than warm bodies and weapons to maintain organized resistance. Without massive blowback all around we can\u2019t do much to remedy Ukraine\u2019s issues with trained manpower. And I\u2019m not convinced the training efforts underway in countries like the UK are as effective as people think. And of course if Ukraine is going to set up corps and perhaps divisional staffs (as they are inching toward) those people have to be trained thoroughly too.</p>\n\n<p>So with all this, I think it makes strategic sense to focus on imposing costs on Russia. The issue is that, this conflict being existential, the best chance of suasion lies in overthrowing Putin and his regime. Ukraine can\u2019t do this alone, and I don\u2019t think we here in the West should try to help because it would result in someone worse. For all his amoral kleptocracy, Putin is a mature adult compared to the kind of far-right figures who are far more prepared to take power than the anti-Putin camp.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, even before the captivity and death of Navalny the non-systemic opposition was not in a position to do much more than they were doing. And now, with the waves of emigration of the exact people who could have formed a mass anti-Putin movement, there is less of a potential support base than ever.</p>\n\n<p>We also haven\u2019t seen Russian liberals taking up arms with Ukraine. On the contrary, the only people willing to exchange samovars and books for rifles and radios are those far-right figures who couldn\u2019t manage to quite fit in with Wagner and Rusich.\nUkraine should seek to change that. At this point, I see little reason for Ukraine not to explicitly pursue regime change. After all, that\u2019s Putin\u2019s declared goal with Ukraine. Because it\u2019s either concede territory, or double down. A middle course will fail, and the Kursk Oblast incursion, which is a form of doubling down, needs to become strategically justified.</p>\n\n<p>I know this is a little pessimistic as usual, but I think it represents plausible projections.</p>\n</div>",

Its been <em>by far</em> the bulk of the equipment support....and similarly has been about 75% (as I understand it) of the financial/humanitarian aid support as well.</p>\n</div>",

She&#39;s had a staff turnover rate over 90%.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I had heard about a high turnover rate in 2020 (which isn&#39;t all that surprising considering how badly run it was), but not about her time as VP. Do we have any insights into her time in the Senate or as AG? Those were longer terms so if the turnover rate was very high there it could be evidence of a longstanding issue. </p>\n\n<p>That being said, a high turnover rate in and of itself isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing. I&#39;d argue that Biden has the opposite problem, there&#39;s extremely little turnover and people who really should be ousted haven&#39;t been.</p>\n</div>",

Since the war started, the Russians have been all talk and no bite because they don\u2019t have any feasible way to escalate that wouldn\u2019t just further antagonise the West, which is not something they have shown they genuinely want to do.</p>\n\n<p>Other Western powers like the UK seem completely nonchalant about Russian \u201cescalation\u201d and it is actually the US and another unnamed NATO country, likely Germany, that was shown to be the powers preventing Storm Shadow from being used on Russian soil. What makes the strategic escalation calculus different for the US compared to the UK that the UK seems to be so willing and ready to match and challenge Russian \u201cred lines\u201d?</p>\n</div>",
