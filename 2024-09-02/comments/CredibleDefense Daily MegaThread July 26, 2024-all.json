Roskomnadzor stated that the deterioration of Google's equipment was to blame.

This was the situation during the British rule and in some parts also post WW2.</p>\n\n<p>Local conflicts between different EAOs post civil war seem almost inevitable, but with some luck they might be contained to certain areas, such that a part of the country can live in peace again.</p>\n\n<p>This will also be true if the SAC wins the war. It would take many many years for the army to reconquer the lost hill states.</p>\n</div>",

Some of the big neutral paramilitary groups like the UWSA (United Wa State Army) join the fight on the side of the SAC.\n\n[I'll link you this article](https://burmesespringmonitor.substack.com/p/was-the-big-deal-a-deep-dive-into) from Nathan Ruser. He points out that since the USWA and SSPP deployed into central Shan state earlier in the month in response to OP10/27 2 they have been relatively permissive to both SAC and 3BHA forces in their newly captured areas, in fact the Junta still occupies several large bases in the area. Essentially the degree to which they will cooperate with either side on allowing passage of forces remains unclear, but he believes that an alliance with Junta forces is unlikely despite wishful thinking from pro-Junta media. He also believes that the cooperation will trend towards the 3BHA in the near future.\n\n\n> These deployments essentially rule out the capture of Tangyan and Mongyai by troops with the Three Brotherhood Alliance, none of those actors want to launch concerted attacks against other EAOs, but the level of accommodation towards varying groups by the newly deployed UWSA and SSPP will be crucial for the strategic outlook of Shan State and the Junta\u2019s North-East Area Command. They may be permissive to both revolutionary and Junta troops passing through, staging and even maintaining a permanent military presence in these newly gained areas. Or they may restrict, to varying degrees any or all actors also seeking a presence in those areas.\n\n>The Junta has significant military investments and garrisons in the newly gained UWSA/SSPP areas, including an advanced military training school, three battalions and a brigade-level Tactical Operations Command, along with several outposts conducting artillery and combat operations in the defence of Lashio.\n\n>Meanwhile, in any assault on Lashio, the MNDAA will rely on transit through these areas and, crucially, the denial of combat operations from Junta units in defence of positions being assaulted as part of Operation 1027 pt 2.\n\n>Presently, there are no indications of how the UWSA is operating in these regards. There have been numerous reports that some units of Junta troops were expelled to Taunggyi, but certainly not the bulk of the troops that were garrisoned in the newly gained townships. Some reporting has suggested that the UWSA intends to expel Junta military camps in the area but not as an urgent priority - but this reporting is poorly sourced and I scarcely consider it more than speculation.\n\n>There have been some complaints by the TNLA that the SSPP allowed safe passage to Junta columns to reinforce Kyaukme through SSPP-controlled territory, but it is unclear whether this was allowed by the SSPP or whether the units snuck through amidst the initial confusion of newly established positions and general movements through the area.\n\n>Members of the 3BHA have not publicly complained about their passage being restricted by either the SSPP or the UWSA.\n\n>Pro-Junta media has reacted positively to the news of these deployments, even suggesting that the UWSA and the Junta military forces could form a unified front against the 3BHA. This is not realistic, and almost certainly just over-zealous commentators latching on to any piece of news that can be spun in a positive light to Junta-supporters, but it is still clear from these reactions that the pro-Junta establishment does not view these deployments as an existential threat to their continued presence in the region. This optimism would mean little, however, in the middle of orders by the UWSA for Junta troops to withdraw and probably does not reflect the sentiment on the ground.\n\n>There has also been speculation that these deployments are an element of Chinese policy being implemented by the UWSA to establish new trading routes to the Burmese Junta that exist outside of the control of explicitly revolutionary groups and preempt the takeover of these territories from revolutionary groups. However, the most established border and road infrastructure East of the Salween goes through Mongla and Kengtung into territory under the firm control of the Junta, and it is not immediately evident what, if any, benefits a new trade route through UWSA territory and into contested territory would bring over the Mongla route.\n\n>Generally, these developments can be viewed along a spectrum of revolutionary support and Junta-accommodation, it is neither of those extremes and will likely be quite fluid following the self-interest of the UWSA and SSPP. I expect that it will trend towards more revolutionary support as the Junta\u2019s position in the region becomes more tenous and less threatening to the SSPP, but right now, it is entirely unclear.",

Which is rather depressing in all honesty given the Houthi blockade is helping starve Sudan. As well as finding UAE citizen passports. </p>\n\n<p>This is hardly the first claim, a UAE citizen did end up dying in Sudan a few months ago and his family did a post on facebook saying even a thousand Sudanese slurs is not worth him leading to the assumption that he was killed by a SAF fighter though  the UAE has denied this.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/rest-of-africa/new-weapons-from-china-turkey-russia-uae-fuelling-sudan-war-4703180\">https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/rest-of-africa/new-weapons-from-china-turkey-russia-uae-fuelling-sudan-war-4703180</a></p>\n\n<p>The weapons supplied to both are coming China, UAE, Russia, T\u00fcrkiye alongside Serbia and Iran though think T\u00fcrkiye favours the SAF given it&#39;s rivalry with the UAE over Libya for example.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#39;&#39; Rapid Support Forces (RSF) fighters released a new video during the recent clashes.

Tighten the noose. Boil the frog. Continue eliminating refineries. Take out airfields especially ones launching attacks on non military targets in Ukraine. Use ATACMS to do this along with drones. I remember the recent comment that this will not be effective and that air combat is the only way forward for Ukraine. Maybe more cunning asymmetrical warfare would be useful for them. Steadily reduce Russia's energy production. Take out more airfields in Crimea. Can the new rail line being built to replace the Kerch bridge be destroyed in any significant way?

Tighten the noose. Boil the frog. Continue eliminating refineries. Take out airfields especially ones launching attacks on non military targets in Ukraine. Use ATACMS to do this along with drones. I remember the recent comment that this will not be effective and that air combat is the only way forward for Ukraine. Maybe more cunning asymmetrical warfare would be useful for them. Steadily reduce Russia&#39;s energy production. Take out more airfields in Crimea. Can the new rail line being built to replace the Kerch bridge be destroyed in any significant way?

                            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>These are things we follow regularly and have daily updates for. They are not assumptions, I am not going through any motions to bring you up to speed. Journalists who are otherwise complete laymen regularly lay out the undeniable bread crumbs of Russian threats and attempts to get the West to self-censure in any of the available podcast level discussions. To those following since the beginning, this is not news.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Unless you have the magical ability to read Putin&#39;s mind, and the minds of the other Russian decisonmakers, then you are making assumptions. Some of which have better evidence than others, none of which are certain.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This type of approach of hybrid-terrorism is the secondary reply because they have no other means of \u2018getting even\u2019. It is a distinctly moscovian political strategy where they break taboos and involve civilians with relatively very little plausible deniability- as if to say they can do this without impunity and definitely to signal another manner of thuggery and knuckle dragging they do not expect we can reply to.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Do they have no other means, or do they have no other means they are willing to risk under the current circumstances? There is a very, very big difference between the two. Just as an example, we&#39;ve already seen unwelcome connections with Iran, North Korea, and so on. There are obvious next steps Russia could take w.r.t. deepening cooperation in that area.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Are we going to let them? What is the minimum level of reply necessary for Putin to understand he must table this type of agitation? You offered literally no reply to the line of questioning, instead seemingly hand wringing if we can afford to even play the game? They are playing it with or without you, but if you ante up you have agency greater than them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The fact that you are asking about &quot;letting them&quot; betrays your naivety. It&#39;s not a matter of &quot;letting&quot; anyone do anything. Putin has made his decision and accepted the risks of it. It&#39;s possible there is no level of reply to convince him otherwise. It&#39;s also possible there is a level that will, just not one that Western leaders are willing to risk. It&#39;s even possible that taking those risks will set off unpredictable or uncontrollable consequences. If you up the ante you are taking greater risks. Whether you can afford those risks is the real question, and thus far the answer seems to be no. That&#39;s what happens when you deal with real risks in the real world. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you don\u2019t have a meaningful reply to the question, simply replying to state don\u2019t do anything because you could be wrong or don\u2019t do anything because who knows what\u2019s really truth, shouldn\u2019t count for a good enough to reply in this sub.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you ask a stupid question, then don&#39;t be surprised when you get an unsatisfying response. You did not ask a specific technical question with a narrowly defined scope, you are essentially just complaining that you don&#39;t like what&#39;s happening.

I've stopped buying just about anything in this cacophony, with regards to some questions rolling dice may be just as reasonable. I'm tempted so say this is one of them. It's actually amazing, the amount of uncertainty in times and a world like this. (At least that is a stark difference to Cold War times.) What seems clear though is a need to differentiate, like between manpower and material, but also between replacing the air force's and ground force equipment. The former will most surely take a lot of time, especially since Russia didn't have exactly many modern assets even at the start of the war, but in part also depends on how long sanctions would remain in effect. At the same time the country is running a wartime economy or something close to it, and that you can't just \"turn off\" overnight, even if you wanted. So *if* the war should end relatively abruptly, I'd expect a lag effect that in the short term would still churn out a lot of stuff, while no longer competing against losses. But that too wouldn't make an excess by any means. In a way, I suspect the question more pressing with regard to the Ukrainian side.
