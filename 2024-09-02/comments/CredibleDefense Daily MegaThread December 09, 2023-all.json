As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

That said, the fact the discussions are taking place at all underscores how seriously the US takes the threat, the people added.\n\n\n>Deputy US National Security Adviser Jon Finer said Thursday the Biden administration has \u201cnot ruled out the possibility of taking military action\u201d against the Houthis but the focus for now is on assembling a maritime coalition to secure the Red Sea \u2014 a conduit for 12% of world trade and the bulk of Middle East energy supplies to Europe.\n\n>**The Houthis would not have been able to carry out the attacks without \u201csignificant\u201d military and intelligence support from Iran, he said.**\n\n\n>US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin relayed a similar message to Saudi Arabia counterpart Prince Khalid Bin Salman, according to the Pentagon.

I honestly don't know what can be done about it.\n\nAs for the later part.\n\nIn my opinion the reasons for the relatively low IDF casualties in Gaza **so far**:\n\n1. Effectiveness of air campaign. In it's strategic planning Hamas planned to abuse the Israeli aversion to enemy civilian casualties due to international pressure in weapons storage, tunnel locations, fighting positions and so on. Past 07/10 the IDF was willing to strike targets that they were not willing to before. This prompted a successful civilian evacuation of Norther Gaza. And snowballed into the IAF and Israeli artillery having a far more free hand, with about 1mil evacuating. The difference is significant especially when compared to previous IDF operations in Gaza.\n\n2. Israel achieved operational surprise by outflanking the Hamas main defense lines and entering Gaza through the rear: the areas next to the sea. The Hamas main defense line holds the majority of their tactical tunnel systems, booby trapped houses (with explosives laid under the floor tiles, or large amounts in the basements etc). Fighting positions and so on. \n\nThe Hamas main defense line is a much harder nut to crack, as is showcased in Beit Hanun, a town of about 50k on the north eastern tip of Northern Gaza, which the IDF has still not cleared completely and still suffers the occasional Hamas fire team emerging from an undiscovered tunnel. Compare to the much larger parts of Gaza city which were captured much more quickly, easily and are now much more quiet such as Shati, Rimal, Naser. The IDF has only recently began entering the main Hamas defense line, from the rear such as Sajaiyah, and Zeitun.\n\n3.

Overall that&#39;s a showcase of the low quality of discussion overall on the topic of Israel-Gaza war. I honestly don&#39;t know what can be done about it.</p>\n\n<p>As for the later part.</p>\n\n<p>In my opinion the reasons for the relatively low IDF casualties in Gaza <strong>so far</strong>:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Effectiveness of air campaign. In it&#39;s strategic planning Hamas planned to abuse the Israeli aversion to enemy civilian casualties due to international pressure in weapons storage, tunnel locations, fighting positions and so on. Past 07/10 the IDF was willing to strike targets that they were not willing to before. This prompted a successful civilian evacuation of Norther Gaza. And snowballed into the IAF and Israeli artillery having a far more free hand, with about 1mil evacuating. The difference is significant especially when compared to previous IDF operations in Gaza.</p></li>\n<li><p>Israel achieved operational surprise by outflanking the Hamas main defense lines and entering Gaza through the rear: the areas next to the sea. The Hamas main defense line holds the majority of their tactical tunnel systems, booby trapped houses (with explosives laid under the floor tiles, or large amounts in the basements etc). Fighting positions and so on. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The Hamas main defense line is a much harder nut to crack, as is showcased in Beit Hanun, a town of about 50k on the north eastern tip of Northern Gaza, which the IDF has still not cleared completely and still suffers the occasional Hamas fire team emerging from an undiscovered tunnel. Compare to the much larger parts of Gaza city which were captured much more quickly, easily and are now much more quiet such as Shati, Rimal, Naser. The IDF has only recently began entering the main Hamas defense line, from the rear such as Sajaiyah, and Zeitun.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The effectiveness of Trophy and IDF tactics which were develop to abuse the protection offered by the system as showcased by the Hamas vids.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>",

        "body": "Really informative overview of the Russian government budget [here](https://ridl.io/how-russia-saved-the-2023-budget/) by Janis Kluge. Absolutely worth it to read fully, but let me provide some highlights and comments:\n\n---\n\n> Even so, the overall story for the year is already clear: A weaker ruble has left Russian revenues 10% higher than planned in the original budget law for 2023. On the other hand, expenditures have also increased by around 10%, leading to a deficit that looks similar to the Finance Ministry\u2019s original projection of 2% of GDP. At the Valdai Forum in October 2023, Putin even predicted a better outcome of 1% of GDP.\n\nNote that Russian inflation is quite high right now and that the Ruble has weakened over the past year. If you were to measure revenue and expenditure in real terms or in $/\u20ac terms you would get a different picture.\n\n---\n\n> Under the surface of these numbers, somewhat hidden by internal spending shifts, war expenditure has accelerated in 2023. The planned increase of \u00abDefense\u00bb spending to 10.8 trillion rubles in 2024 (6% of GDP) is actually not such a big jump, but rather a continuation of a pre-existing trend.\n\n--- \n\nThere is a good explanation in the article of how a weakening ruble increases revenue (both through oil & gas revenues and import taxes). This creates an interesting dilemma for the Russian government. On the one hand a weakening Ruble helps to keep their budget deficit in check, on the other hand it also leads to higher inflation (though the degree of this is debatable, Russia is less import dependent than most other countries), which then forces the central bank to raise interest rates. Clearly also not a great situation. \n\n---\n\nSome interesting elements of war spending:\n\n> \u00abHousing\u00bb includes the construction and maintenance of public buildings. In 2020, spending in this category was 372 billion rubles. In 2023, it is expected to be 847 billion in the latest projections, a strong increase when compared to the already high 591 billion in the original budget for this year. A closer look at spending subcategories (quarterly budget reporting is still very detailed) reveals that this sudden increase is related to spending on frontal regions and annexed territories. The situation in \u00abTransfers\u00bb is similar. This category mostly consists of subsidies to regional budgets, which usually follow strict a predictable formula. This year, there was a sudden increase from 1252 billion to 1530 billion rubles. Again, a closer look reveals that this increase is related to construction activities close to the frontline.\n\n---\n\n> On paper, the deficit in last year\u2019s budget was 2.1%, while this year\u2019s deficit is predicted to come in at 1.8% in the Explanatory Note attached to the new budget law. Even if the actual deficit is closer to 1% as Putin suggested, the underlying trend is still negative. The reason is that some of 2023 spending was already built into the 2022 budget.\n\n> 2022 was an historically profitable year for Russia, as Moscow benefitted from high energy prices, which in turn were boosted by Russia\u2019s own aggression \u2014 economics is often not fair. Russia used the comfortable budget situation to prepare. In 2022, the government allowed small- and medium-sized companies to defer their social security contributions, meaning less revenue for the state in 2022 and more in 2023 and 2024. In addition, the Finance Ministry made a prepayment to the \u00abSocial Fund of Russia\u00bb (pensions and social transfers) in December 2022, effectively transferring 1% of GDP from the 2022 windfall to 2023.\n\n> This is why the Finance Ministry\u2019s itself estimates the \u00abtrue deficit\u00bb (without prepayments and other distorting factors) for 2022 at 0.7% of GDP and the \u00abtrue deficit\u00bb for 2023 at 2.7%. These numbers are a better representation of the Russian government\u2019s ability to collect taxes and the spending requirements of the war and show that the situation clearly worsened in 2023.\n\n---\n\n> This means that 2024 could also be the year when the price of the war will finally be felt more acutely by average Russians. Consumer prices have already increased by over 0.8% per month in September and October 2023, which is equivalent of a 10% annual rate. Until the presidential elections in March 2024, the government will certainly keep the ruble stable with the newly re-introduced capital controls, and keep budget spending high.\n\n> However, propping up the ruble today only leads to more downside pressure after the support measures end, and extra spending before the election means less spending afterwards. Furthermore, if the Central Bank is serious about bringing inflation down, it might have to drive Russia\u2019s economy into recession to achieve that goal. While the Finance Ministry built its budget for 2024 around the expectation of 2.3% GDP growth next year, recent forecasts have already become much more pessimistic, and even a recession seems possible.",

Last week we got a batch full of duds.\u201d\n\n*non-paywalled:*\n\n**Surrounded and low on ammo, the elite troops out to spoil Putin\u2019s New Year**\n\nOne of Ukraine\u2019s finest brigades has been sent to defend the key city of Avdiivka. Without more gear their chances are dwindling, they tell Maxim Tucker\n\nBacked by a western-supplied Bradley M1, soldiers from the 47th Brigade appeal for support outside Avdiivka\n\nBacked by a western-supplied Bradley M1, soldiers from the 47th Brigade appeal for support outside Avdiivka\n\nMaxim Tucker\n\n, Ocheretyne\n\nFriday December 08 2023, 3.45pm GMT, The Times\n\nStarved of ammunition, the gunners of Ukraine\u2019s 47th Brigade were not able to hit the Russian convoy before it was upon their infantry on Avdiivka\u2019s northern flank.\n\nFive armoured vehicles rolled into the village of Stepove, guns firing, allowing about 40 Russian soldiers to run for cover in the houses around Ukrainian positions. A Bradley fighting vehicle was deployed towards the Russians. American armour was to be put to the test against Russian.\n\nThis fierce battle was part of a desperate action to save Avdiivka, in the east of the country, from imminent collapse and prevent a victory for President Putin in time for the launch of his election campaign and New Year festivities.\n\nThe 47th is one of Ukraine\u2019s best-equipped brigades. Outfitted with German Leopard 2 tanks and American Bradley M1 fighting vehicles to lead the summer counteroffensive, it was tasked with breaking heavily fortified positions in a run to the Black Sea, but was withdrawn in October after making only six miles, mauled by Russian bombing, minefields and Lancet drones.\n\n\u201cWith great equipment comes great responsibilities,\u201d said Sergeant Danylo \u201cSausage\u201d, 23, who is part of a 2nd Battalion, 47th Brigade air reconnaissance team. He shows me a live feed of the battle from four of his drones.\n\nThe war in Ukraine is at a critical moment. The fall of Avdiivka would mean Ukrainian forces fall back to the reservoirs of Karlivka and the heights at Ocheretyne. Karlivka supplies water to the remaining Ukrainian-held territory in the Donbas, with any battle there severely disrupting its flow. Seizing the heights at Ocheretyne, two miles away, would allow the Russians to begin razing Myrnohrad, a city of 50,000.\n\nUnless the West provides brigades like the 47th with ammunition, they will be unable to stop Putin\u2019s troops. The Russians could run on to Dnipro, with a population of one million, and sweep north towards Kyiv, cutting off Ukraine\u2019s army in the Donbas.\n\nHolding Avdiivka is also key to maintaining morale. Its defence is a tribute to the thousands of soldiers who have died there since Russia\u2019s hybrid invasion of 2014. And the Ukrainian positions here are a dagger at the throat of the occupied city of Donetsk, which is central to any future Ukrainian counteroffensive to recover the Donbas region.\n\nThe commitment of one of Ukraine\u2019s best brigades is testament to the importance of this battle, where Ukrainian troops cling on despite almost complete encirclement, their supply and medical evacuation vehicles running through heavy artillery fire for the last 14 miles of their route.\n\nDespite heavy losses over the summer, the men of the 47th are motivated and ready to fight. Yet partisan politics in Washington is delaying their essential supplies and the EU\u2019s failure to meet its promise to deliver a million artillery rounds have forced Ukrainian troops to ration their ammunition, with catastrophic consequences on the battlefield.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shitty situation,\u201d Sausage said. The shell shortage forces soldiers like Sergeant Taras \u201cFizruk\u201d, a 31-year-old mortar gunner, also from the 2nd Battalion, to make impossible life and death decisions.\n\n\u201cWe had ten times more ammunition over summer, and better quality,\u201d he said. \u201cAmerican rounds come in batches of almost identical weights, which makes it easier to correct fire, with very few duds. Now we have shells from all over the world with different qualities and we only get 15 for three days. Last week we got a batch full of duds.\u201d\n\nInstead of firing on Russians as soon as they come within range, they have to wait to be sure they are heading for their positions, and only hit large groups.\n\n\u201cWe should be controlling our sector from 4km away, so we can kill a few hundred Russian soldiers before they get to our infantry and we only take a few wounded,\u201d he said. \u201cBut without ammunition we can\u2019t. When it\u2019s two or three soldiers I\u2019m not shooting any more, only when it\u2019s a critical situation, say ten guys close to our infantry, we will work. If our rounds aren\u2019t the same weight, the next round will fly two hundred metres past the Russians. And then it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n\nRather than watch helplessly as smaller groups encroach on their infantry, his men sometimes resort to flying their unarmed drones at enemy troops, who temporarily scatter fearing they are about to have a grenade dropped on them.\n\nBoth men say the brigade is not getting enough equipment. Anticipating their western allies becoming distracted by the crisis in the Middle East, they fundraised for those items they can buy, but much of it is held up at the border by a blockade of Polish truckers, disgruntled that Ukrainian drivers are undercutting their wages in Europe.\n\nFor now, Ukraine is on the defensive. The railroad which runs through the village of Stepove marks the northern flank of Avdiivka\u2019s last line of defence. The village holds, but it is bloody, gruelling work. The Russians seem able to absorb an endless amount of casualties, spurred on by fear of their own commanders. Ukrainian defenders are suffering too. American M113 armoured personnel carriers on the road from Avdiivka to Ocheretyne pull out a steady stream of casualties.\n\nJust as during the counteroffensive in the south, Russian air superiority and the delay in the delivery of F16 jets capable of standing off Russian bombers means that Avdiivka is in ruins, hit daily by 500kg Russian KAB bombs. \u201cTen days ago 32 KABs hit the city in a single day,\u201d Vitaliy Barabash, head of the Avdiivka City Military Administration, said.\n\nBarabash grew up in a village near Avdiivka, which had a population of 32,000 before the invasion. Now he is presiding over the hasty evacuation of its remaining 1,300 inhabitants.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sad thing to see the city I\u2019ve known since childhood and the village where I was born being erased. I\u2019ve been head of the city since 2020 and we made a lot of improvements in those two years. It\u2019s all being wiped out,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe town changes not by the day, but by the hour. In the morning you drive past a damaged building, then the bombs fall and when you leave in the evening, it\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Oleksii Savchenko",

However, these two goals can be achieved only for a short while and only at the expense of economic rationality.*\n\nThe Russian regime presents the current economy as a triumph that it masterminded. \u201cWe have completely gotten over the recession of last year and growth is picking up,\u201d Putin told his loyal foreign guests at the Valdai Club.\r  \n\r  \nIndeed, in the third quarter of 2023, Russian GDP, according to Rosstat, was up 5.5% year-on-year, and growth in real disposable household income came in at 5.1%.\n\n...\n\nHowever, not all Russian analysts agree with the official GDP growth estimates. The MMI Telegram channel, which is considered close to the Central Bank, responded rather irritably to Rosstat\u2019s triumphant reading: \u201cit\u2019s complete nonsense, of course. Games with deflators in the production of defense goods... For the year (i.e., for the whole 2023 \u2013 Shelin)they can roll out any figure.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nIndeed, such \u201cgames with deflators\u201d \u2013 manipulating how last year\u2019s prices are converted into current ones \u2013 were almost certainly played. This can be seen from indirect indicators. For example, loading volumes on railways are considered to well reflect the situation in industry and construction, and overall for the period January-November 2023 volumes remained at the same level as in 2022, while in November they decreased year-on-year.\r  \n\r  \nIn addition, even the rapid growth that actually took place across the economy in the last months of 2022 and at the beginning of 2023 stopped 5-6 months ago. Consumption and real wages (seasonally adjusted) have virtually stopped growing since June. Industrial production has stagnated since May. In the month of October, industrial output was 0.6% lower than five months earlier. At the same time, defense industries that produce machinery and equipment saw average monthly volumes up 14% versus the pre-war 2021.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cAlthough economic activity officially continues to increase, the balance of factors driving the prospects for the Russian economy\u2019s further development is extremely contradictory and likely unsustainable,\u201d sums up the government-linked Center for Macroeconomic Analysis and Short-Term Forecasting, whose analysis is considered relatively honest.\n\nBut what needs explanation now is not so much Russia\u2019s economic problems (we shall discuss them below).\r  \n\u201cWhat is important is the incontrovertible fact that the Russian economy actually overcame Western sanctions and did so much faster and smoothly than anyone had expected.\u201d\n\nThe embellished official numbers do not change this fact.\r  \n\r  \nAs we learned, Russia can even do without huge earnings from oil sales. After all, current oil prices are not so favorable for Russia: Urals sold for $62.9 per barrel in January-November 2023 versus $78.3 per barrel in January-November 2022, while energy export volumes are decreasing.\n\n...\n\nIt is believed that the authorities are thus paving the way for Putin\u2019s next reelection, scheduled for March 2024. The logic is that if they do not appease the population, then some turbulence might pop up during the reelection campaign, even leading to street protests.\r  \n\r  \nYet anyone familiar with Russian affairs knows that the regime can count on the obedience of the population and has no reason to fear the people. If anything can shake things up, it would only be a new mobilization drive, but certainly not a decrease in household income by a couple percent.\r  \n\r  \nDeclines in living standards in 2009 due to the global financial crisis, in 2015-16 due to falling oil prices and in 2020 due to the pandemic did not create any major problems for the authorities.\r  \n\r  \nThe system of compensating those who are needed for the war and their families was well established last year. The plight of everyone else should not be a big worry. Not to mention that the election will obviously be rigged.\r  \n\r  \nThe excited declamations of officials that \u201cthe ruble exchange rate and inflation must be stabilized before the elections\u201d do not reflect their fear of imaginary popular protests. They are not afraid of the people at all. \u201cThe president has a fetish for inflation,\u201d explains an anonymous Putin administration official, \u201cand he does not like the \\[current\\] exchange rate.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nPutin\u2019s Russia has long become a show for one. And the vigorous efforts of the financial and economic elite are not being made to please the masses; these officials are catering to Putin\u2019s fetishes and obsessions. The ruler really cannot stand high inflation and a weak ruble. After all, these signs of trouble are reminiscent of the 1990s, which his propaganda calls \u201ccursed\u201d and \u201cwild.\u201d In addition, the March \u201celections\u201d themselves are a real event for Putin. Unlike the Russian people, he takes the ritual of his reelection seriously.\r  \n\r  \nWe can assume that when the \u201celections\u201d are over, economic forces will be allowed to take effect again, Russians will have to tighten their belts and Putin will order another performance for himself.

At the same time, defense industries that produce machinery and equipment saw average monthly volumes up 14% versus the pre-war 2021.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAlthough economic activity officially continues to increase, the balance of factors driving the prospects for the Russian economy\u2019s further development is extremely contradictory and likely unsustainable,\u201d sums up the government-linked Center for Macroeconomic Analysis and Short-Term Forecasting, whose analysis is considered relatively honest.</p>\n\n<p>But what needs explanation now is not so much Russia\u2019s economic problems (we shall discuss them below).</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat is important is the incontrovertible fact that the Russian economy actually overcame Western sanctions and did so much faster and smoothly than anyone had expected.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The embellished official numbers do not change this fact.</p>\n\n<p>As we learned, Russia can even do without huge earnings from oil sales. After all, current oil prices are not so favorable for Russia: Urals sold for $62.9 per barrel in January-November 2023 versus $78.3 per barrel in January-November 2022, while energy export volumes are decreasing.</p>\n\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>It is believed that the authorities are thus paving the way for Putin\u2019s next reelection, scheduled for March 2024. The logic is that if they do not appease the population, then some turbulence might pop up during the reelection campaign, even leading to street protests.</p>\n\n<p>Yet anyone familiar with Russian affairs knows that the regime can count on the obedience of the population and has no reason to fear the people. If anything can shake things up, it would only be a new mobilization drive, but certainly not a decrease in household income by a couple percent.</p>\n\n<p>Declines in living standards in 2009 due to the global financial crisis, in 2015-16 due to falling oil prices and in 2020 due to the pandemic did not create any major problems for the authorities.</p>\n\n<p>The system of compensating those who are needed for the war and their families was well established last year. The plight of everyone else should not be a big worry. Not to mention that the election will obviously be rigged.</p>\n\n<p>The excited declamations of officials that \u201cthe ruble exchange rate and inflation must be stabilized before the elections\u201d do not reflect their fear of imaginary popular protests. They are not afraid of the people at all. \u201cThe president has a fetish for inflation,\u201d explains an anonymous Putin administration official, \u201cand he does not like the [current] exchange rate.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Putin\u2019s Russia has long become a show for one. And the vigorous efforts of the financial and economic elite are not being made to please the masses; these officials are catering to Putin\u2019s fetishes and obsessions. The ruler really cannot stand high inflation and a weak ruble. After all, these signs of trouble are reminiscent of the 1990s, which his propaganda calls \u201ccursed\u201d and \u201cwild.\u201d In addition, the March \u201celections\u201d themselves are a real event for Putin. Unlike the Russian people, he takes the ritual of his reelection seriously.</p>\n\n<p>We can assume that when the \u201celections\u201d are over, economic forces will be allowed to take effect again, Russians will have to tighten their belts and Putin will order another performance for himself. Perhaps featuring the army.</p>\n</div>",
