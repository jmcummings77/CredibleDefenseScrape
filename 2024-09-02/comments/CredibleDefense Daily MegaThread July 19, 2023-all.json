Tim Kaine, D-Va., introduced the amendment alongside Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla, which senators adopted in a 65-28 vote.\n\n---\n\n>Additionally, the Senate voted down 39-60 an amendment from Sens. Josh Hawley, R-Ky., and J.D.

Russia is doing what it usually tends to avoid (and unlike what Ukraine often does), i.e. sending units of a single formation to different sectors and mix those of several military districts in one sector.\n\nAccording to the Center for Defense Strategies, a new BARS detachment has been recently transferred from Kreminna to Bakhmut. The sector hosts the vast majority of the 2nd Corps (former LPR Army, now SMD), units made up largely of Russian mobilized and of the 3rd Corps (WMD), the latter having been transferred from Avdiivka (where Russia appears to have eased its grip, although the 10th Tank Regiment is still down there) to cover the flanks after Wagner's withdrawal. Elements of the 150th Division of the SMD are being transferred from Marinka (currently one tank and one motorized regiment).\n\nThe 217th Regiment of the 98th VDV Division is active in Berkhivka, while the 331st seems to be still in Kreminna belying reports that it was in Bakhmut as well.  In the southern flank near Kurdyumivka the 57th Brigade of the EMD is present. In Dubovo-Vasylivka there is the 200th Brigade from the Arctic Fleet while the other two Arctic brigades are in Kherson. Even the presence of the 80th Tank Regiment from CMD, which in theory should have been in Kreminna with the rest of the 90th Division, is reported.\n\nI was seeing earlier on Telegram a video from the 106th VDV Division (deployed between Bakhmut and Soledar) where T-90Ms are featured (we know that the 80th Tank Regiment fields them) and they write about armoured units \"attached\" to airborne regiments. It's possible that Russia is introducing a kind of hybrid unit where companies of tank regiments are attached to VDV battalions to achieve a combination of capable infantry + armoured support. This would explain the influx of tank regiments into the area. Although Rob Lee once wrote T-90Ms were provided to VDV too.\n\nThe 83rd VDV Brigade is garrisoning Klishchiivka, supporting the \"infamous\" 72nd Brigade of the 3rd Corps (the one that fled its positions after the first Ukrainian counterattacks in the second week of May). Very heavy fighting is going on in Klishchiivka, with the men of the excellent 3rd Assault Brigade on the Ukrainian side. The presence of numerous VDV units on the Bakhmut flanks, however, makes me a bit pessimistic about a continuation of the advances in the short term, partly because the Ukrainians are not sending reinforcements to Bakhmut (beyond the new 22nd Brigade), at the moment the formations in the area are the ones deployed in the sector since winter.\n\nThe ISW reported that elements of the 83rd Brigade reportedly complained asking for a rotation, which suggests that attrition is high since it's a brigade that while had suffered very heavy losses at Kherson, had not seen action ever since afaik. Also in the very same area the 11th VDV Brigade is deployed, which has been engaged to a lesser extent so far.\n\nPersonally, seeing the situation in Bakhmut, I am somewhat bearish about the chances of a large-scale Russian armoured attack from Kupyansk to Kreminna. That said, however, many Russian formations are deployed in the area, and according to the Centre for Defense Strategies, such grouping is the most powerful Russian one deployed in Ukraine; recently several formations of the 1st GTA and 20th CAA have reportedly been training in Belarus (I guess they have also partially replenished their equipment after the heavy losses of the last year).\n\nFor some reason the Russians have been announcing advances in the Kupyansk area like every week since March. They announced a few weeks ago that they had captured Lyman Pershyi... which has always been theirs. The advances in recent weeks in Kupyansk are measured in terms of an handful of kilometers at best. At the moment the attacks in Kupyansk and Svatove are localized and are the work of mostly Storm Z units; Ukraine in the last month has been pouring a really large number of troops, including new brigades (such as the \"Swedish\" one, the 21st, with CV-90s) into the area.\n\nTaking the eastern bank of the Oskil River would mean reaching a natural barrier; but in my view it's somewhat doubtful that in the short term this would favor Russia: it would make no longer feasible for Ukraine any push towards Svatove, but at the same time it would also be a barrier to further Russian ambitions towards Kharkiv from the East as well and could free up Ukrainian brigades (a situation that reminds me somewhat of the opposite, on a small scale, of what happened at Kherson). If there is anything that actually makes sense for the Russians it would be to try to take control over the Serebryanka forest all the way to the banks of the Zherebets. It would secure Kreminna and would bear consequences south of the Seversky Donets, since the Siversk salient would find itself surrounded on 3 sides, which would be worrisome not so much for potential crossings (the Russians must still have nightmares of crossings in that area), but because it would put Ukrainian positions to the south in mortar range for instance.\n\nIn the Serebryanka forest, fierce fighting has been going on for months, Russia had deployed there numerous VDV units and also the CMD's BMPT Terminators showed up; on the Ukrainian side since the beginning of the year there has been in that area the largest grouping of National Guard units of any sector of the front - I was reading this [interview](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2023/07/15/7411495/) btw. In any case these past weeks several National Guard brigades have been sent between Robotyne and Novopokrovka, including Offensive Guard brigades such as Azov (not to be confused with the 3rd Brigade), Spartan and Kara-Dag. Meanwhile, the 247th Regiment of the 7th VDV Division has reportedly been deployed in Staromaiorske, a sign that the Russians are committing their operational reserves, particularly from Kherson Oblast.",

Observation points, electronics/comms/surveillance equipment, mortar/ATGM positions, soft vehicles etc.</p>\n\n<p>Good for skirmishing over the Dnipro in Kherson for example.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>In general, nothing special.

Korea.\n\nActually, it will be the opposite.  Despite loud rhetoric, DPRK doesn't grab random US citizens off the street and hold them as hostages.  That's not their MO.  There has been thousands of US citizens that traveled to DPRK when the border/tour was open - it's not open due to covid right now.   \n And of the many thousands, only handful were detained against their will.   \n Every US nationals that were held against their will in DPRK at one point all came back out alive and well minus Otto Warmbier.  Most if not all of them committed - in the eyes of DPRK laws - some kind of \"crime\" to be held in DPRK be that stealing a propaganda poster or bringing in a bible etc.\n\nAs to the particular case of Pvt. King, if he really wants to stay in DPRK, not sure if DPRK would keep him or not.

Despite loud rhetoric, DPRK doesn&#39;t grab random US citizens off the street and hold them as hostages.  That&#39;s not their MO.  There has been thousands of US citizens that traveled to DPRK when the border/tour was open - it&#39;s not open due to covid right now.<br/>\n And of the many thousands, only handful were detained against their will.<br/>\n Every US nationals that were held against their will in DPRK at one point all came back out alive and well minus Otto Warmbier.  Most if not all of them committed - in the eyes of DPRK laws - some kind of &quot;crime&quot; to be held in DPRK be that stealing a propaganda poster or bringing in a bible etc.</p>\n\n<p>As to the particular case of Pvt.

The US Navy and Marines, both of which have substantial air assets, barely played a part. With all planning for the operation done by Central Command (led by Schwartzkopf), their air staff were tasked with the air option. \n\nEarly on it was actually hijacked even higher by an even higher USAF planning headquarters back in the United States where it almost turned into a completely different operation, 100% strategic bombing attack, 0% to support a ground offensive, because in their mind there was no need for a ground offensive because the CONUS based planners (led by a supposedly genius colonel) were sure the air campaign would be so effective that Saddam would capitulate and retreat out of Kuwait and concede to whatever other demands placed on him.\n\nHowever, that didn't at all pass muster at CENTCOM, partly because Schwartzkopf would never sign off on it, but also because the top USAF general wasn't part of the SAC Bomber Mafia like the other planners but was a former fighter pilot with a background in tactical air.\n\nSo they created a campaign that was half strategic strikes (to include terror attacks to shock and anger Iraqi civilians against power and water hoping to trigger a revolution), with the other half devoted to an attritional campaign in support of a potential ground offensive to liberate Kuwait if the strategic campaign didn't work.\n\nSchwartzkopf's Left Hook offensive plan was actually VERY risk averse and not in the slightest based on Mission Command. Part of the plan envisioned no offensive being launched until the Iraqis were reduced in strength by 50%. And they were even trying to daily qualify that with intelligence that turned out to be way way way off overestimating damage/destruction. \n\nThat wasn't supposed to be just the Iraqi Army forces, the conventional infantry units mostly that were largely conscript based and manning fixed defenses either in Kuwait, the coast, or the Iraqi border, but the armored and mech infantry divisions of the Republican Guard especially, who were deemed the Center of Gravity and chief target of the ground offensive (to be utterly destroyed), and not located on the front lines but in reserve waiting to either counterattack, reinforce a breakthrough, or cover a retreat (sound a bit like how the Russians are using VDV and naval infantry in their current defense?).\n\nBut the strikes weren't equal. Most ended up against Iraq itself going after a mixture of targets, ranging from military, communications, power, oil, WMDs, water, radio/tv/media, etc. What was used against Iraqi forces near the front lines was nearly entirely against Iraqi Army units on the Saddam Line built between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.\n\nAir Force planners actually deliberately avoided other Iraqi forces. Part of that was because they were worried about better air defenses the Republican Guard had, being armored/mech inf compared to IA regular infantry divisions. Additionally, and most importantly, they didn't want to give away the attack by striking the rear and especially not on the Saudi Iraq border, where the Coalition kept their main effort way back and only moved them up two days before the offensive started, to preserve OPSEC.\n\nDespite that, Schwartzkopf, a notorious bully to subordinates and genuine toxic boss, even went as far as accusing 3-4 star USAF generals of treachery and cowardice for not going harder after the Republican Guard. \n\nFun fact, numerous top generals, Army and USAF both said working for Schwarzkopf was the most unpleasant experience in their lives and some supposedly were brought to tears and near heart attack induced rage by his regular public one way ass chewings (the reason his nickname was The Bear, he LOVED attacking subordinates).\n\nContinued in part 2",

However the border was only covered by two Marine divisions sandwiching two Arab divisions (Syrian and Egyptian, who weren't at their best). There was originally planned a legit amphibious assault for a whole Marine brigade but it got cancelled due to the mine threat and collateral damage concerns to Kuwaiti natural gas facilities, but they left them at sea as a feint that worked to tie up more IA divisions to guard the coast.\n\nThat sector turned out way easier than expected, the attack was supposed to be limited to fix the Iraqis and make them think it was the main effort, but the Marines managed to punch through the defenses within the night and then breakout.\n\nThe Iraqis on the Saudi Iraq border got hit by surprise with three corps, one of them was the tank and IFV heaviest in the history of warfare, and that went about as expected. \n\nHelping both breaches was the Iraqi mines buried in the sand were extremely easy to spot because the wind blew the loose sand off.

And they'd developed a few nasty tactics, techniques and procedures fighting the Iranians that didn't work against Coalition forces (often referred to as training scars). And lastly their discipline wasn't very good.\n\nAir support played a limited role in the flanking attack, partly because they limited it due to worries about fratricide, but also because few had PGMs or ability to target at night. Part because air defenses were still active.
