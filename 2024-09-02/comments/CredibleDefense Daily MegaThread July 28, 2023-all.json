But you think they created a doctrine they all follow? No, when referring to doctrine you need to point not even to a country but to specific branches within the military, and even specific type of units.\n\nDid you know that within the US Army, light infantry units are MUCH more reliant on air support than the units with IFV for every squad, two tank companies in every battalion, and self propelled artillery following them? Can you guess why? \n\nAnd air power should be capitalized to Air Power, for the level of respect it should command, since only a handful of countries in the world have ever had any ability to try it. It's not just a capability, it's an ideology nearly as strong as a religion, plus it's a money pit that ALWAYS costs more than ground forces. \n\nFun fact: to get Air Power, the USAF's 2022 budget was $156.3 billion. Ukraine's GDP is less.\n\nAnd it has been proven that ground operations work without air support in numerous conflicts fought since WW2 where air superiority often wasn't possible, often enough air support at all wasn't available, especially in certain locations and times where \"the show went on.\" It will worked. \n\nAnd what matters isn't a manned fixed wing aircraft doing air support (which seems to be the only type of air support this sub thinks exists). It's the effects they provide. Strategic bombing, air defense, aerial reconnaissance, close air support, and air interdiction. All of those can be done by other weapon systems than manned fixed wing aircraft, and Ukraine has access to all the alternative ways of doing them, and has been doing them. \n\nWhat you're trying to suggest is things would be totally different if for example, GMLRS wasn't doing long range strikes and instead in order to strike Russian rear areas it required a highly complex hundred ship strike package, requiring mid air refueling, AWACs, SEAD, EW, air to air support, and bombing to do the same thing:  \n\nWhat exactly do you think Air Power really brings to the table?",

So to bomb a single tank doing CAS requires either accepting the risk of local air defenses and hoping to try to use tactics and jamming to overcome them, or for better survivability need to include aircraft whose only role is suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD), plus other aircraft performing air defense role against enemy aircraft (air superiority). The deeper they go into enemy territory, the more dangerous the GBAD,, the more effort they need to perform to survive. \n\nBut the deeper they go, the better the targets they can hit. While close air support (CAS) is probably the most talked about use of air power, it's the least preferred by air forces. For the same reason HIMARS GMLRS are used primarily to go after key targets in the enemy rear and not just random tanks or individual artillery pieces, using a limited number of attack aircraft, using a limited quantity of highly trained and expensive/slow to create pilots flying a single aircraft that costs as much as a whole tank company.\n\nTo achieve dominance in one sector means successful DEAD, driving off enemy aircraft doing air defense, terrific EW, etc. And it ends as soon as the enemy turns to pop up air defense tactics. \n\nTo do SEAD/DEAD, it requires tracking enemy radars. If there is no major SEAD threat, they emit 24/7. However, if there is a threat they'll start staggering them so some are on while some are off in a less predictable manner. If an enemy is successful at SEAD/DEAD, everyone turns off and only very briefly turns on when they believe enemy aircraft are overhead and vulnerable, then they only turn on long enough to track, lock and launch. Depending on the missiles they use, they don't need to be active for the ADA missile to track. And enemy missiles might not be able to keep tracking once the radar turns off.\n\nA big reason for HARM success in SEAD isn't actually hitting radars, it's forcing the operators to turn them off temporarily, giving enough time for the aircraft the SEAD sortie were protecting to do their thing.  \n\n>I just also think there's a fairly good reason why everybody who can spends so much money on planes. \n\nIt's a bit deeper than that. \n\nFirst, you have to remember that unmanned aircraft were in their infancy before this war started, as were long range ground to ground PGMs. Most concepts of Air Power relate to the pre-drone version, which was literally still hypothetical until this war started. \n\nSo there are a lot of missions now that SHOULD NOT be done with manned aircraft if it's not absolutely required. That's a big reason why the US doesn't want to give ATACMS to Ukraine. If we don't have them, we need to use manned fixed wing aircraft for deep strike missions, and that'll be costly in many ways. It potentially might not even work.\n\nSecond, many of the better tier air forces, especially the USAF, were NOT created to support ground operations. The opposite actually, the US Army Air Corps got to become an autonomous branch of the Army even before WW2 started, and become its own separate service right after the war ended. All to support its own ideology about warfare, Air Power, with its major focus on strategic bombing to win wars. That's dominated Air Power discussion since the 1920s and is a big reason so many of the world's air forces exist.\n\nA few militaries created air forces that were designed to support ground operations but even they often heavily got into strategic bombing, which is a black hole of funding (with very debatable results). The Soviet Union's VVS had a major strategic bombing mission but also a big role assisting ground units, both air attacks and air defense (especially worrying about NATO). \n\nThird, a lot of the other air forces that aren't very big or able to perform much with their air force either just want the capability without really knowing how to use it properly (Ukraine fighter and strike aircraft are like that), or they're part of a larger alliance that includes a major Air Power partner that is going to do all the heavy lifting for planning, logistics, etc, so they just need to attach some squadrons or wings and just follow orders. \n\n>If there were no planes, but some himars could fly, everybody would want those ones too.\n\nAnd that's exactly why everyone, especially in the US military, are now fighting to get the latest batch of HIMARS. And that's with the Precision Strike Missile not even created yet, which will change everything again, giving all units with HIMARS the ability to strike the entity of the enemy operational rear areas and well into the strategic rear, double the range of the ATACMS. \n\nOn top of that are cruise missiles, another weapon system used extensively for the more difficult deep strike missions that used to be done by manned aircraft.

I think that there is a 3rd way however that builds on that.\n\nThe West, and a lot of our experienced defence commentators, are excellent at getting the basics right but poor on innovation. Email was a revolution via combining traditional snail mail with the new connectivity of the internet. What Ukraine needs now is a revolution that merges combined arms warfare with the new capabilities of unmanned systems and munitions. It needs that revolution and it needs it in mass.\n\nFor example. Massive, war time production of a Lancet equivalent. 10,000 a month to print Russia off the battlefield. Armed UGV's for leading assaults. Heavy lift drones that can scan and map minefields. Heavy lift drones that can carry infantryman over minefields or emplace remote weapons systems in overwatch/enfilade positions next to enemy trenches, and supress the trenches while the assault team moves in. Perhaps drones that could place remote weapon systems with MANPADS well behind enemy lines to ambush Russian aircraft. Massive production of anti-radiation loitering munitions to shut down Russian radars and EW equipment. Medium size drones like TB2 armed with air-to-air missiles, sent to go hunting just behind Russian lines. Putting heavy torpedos or anti-ship missiles on Ukrainian drone boats, rather than relying on the suicide boat approach. A navalised Brimstone (SeaSpear) on one of those little drone boats could cause a real mess in Sevastopol for example.\n\nSecondly, I think the West has missed the opportunity to go after something that could be a real pressure point for Putin. Air Defences. Putin does not give a damn about hundreds of thousands of Russians dying for him in Ukraine. He's never genuinely feared a NATO invasion of Russia, he knows the West has zero interest. What he is scared of however is Western Airpower. He does not want to end up like Saddam or Gaddafi. He's seen what US airpower did to Wagner in Africa. If Russia wants to throw hands with NATO on any scale at any point in the near future they need extensive ground based air-defences to create an area-denial environment for Western airpower. Without it they are toast.\n\nSo there could have been a significantly scaled up, far more focused, effort to attrite Russian ground based air defences. Currently Ukraine is having to rely on a very small quantity of old Soviet jets shooting HARM's without their full use capability. Ukraine needs better platforms for launching HARMS and they need more platforms. F-16's. Can they be launched from a helicopter? Can we knock up a HARM ground based launcher and give one, with all the bells and whistles for ELINT geolocation, to each Ukrainian division. Where are the anti-radiation loitering munitions? Why have we not gone nuts mass producing an equivalent or licenced copy of the Israeli drones that go hunting radars?",

All this time they've not done one battalion-level push?\n\nThey surely have, but when reports are saying brigades or battalions are attacking might not be an accurate description. It can just be subordinate units all essentially fighting their own battles because they can't coordinate at the higher levels.Or won't. \n\nI'm not sure on the first point, but there are enough people talking to the UAF troops during this offensive, including officers, who are the ones saying it. \n\nAs for the second point, what if they won't coordinate because they think they shouldn't? \n\nI mentioned the other day that if there is a legit big push for Mission Command in the UAF, coupled with the fact that the UAF officer corps has some problems with standards and training, which also means education, what does mission command look like to someone who doesn't fully understand military operations? It looks like decentralized units each fighting their own fight because true mission command is antethema to coordination. \n\nMission Command works best during highly fluid maneuver warfare, but it's ass backwards for set piece battles, which is what a combined arms breach is. You can't give a one paragraph order to a subordinate, only giving them a basic mission and objective, and call it a day. Great when it's impossible for higher HQs to coordinate the fight because of fog of war, communication lag, etc. But certain types of operations, it can't work.\n\nThe US military talks up Mission Command, but we rarely do it in combat. Can you imagine trying to launch the Desert Storm offensive where every commander from corps to platoon can do things as they like? Trying to clear Fallujah where every platoon can do it as they please? We don't do it mostly because our officers are trained to know when not to use it. And most of the time it doesn't work, actual tight coordination is necessary. \n\nWhat if the Ukrainians don't realize this? What if it's not just a matter of not knowing how to coordinate a brigade attack? Which isn't that hard (the Iraqis and Iranians could both do it). What if they don't do it because they think that's what they're not supposed to do? \n\nIt wouldn't be the first time a military was actively fighting a war using the wrong doctrine.\n\nA few months back, Kofman et al went to Ukraine and said they were told all the old Soviet era officers, more likely the Post'91-Pre'15 era, are micromanaging. Okay, theyre not doing Mission Command. But those are also the officers who outright wouldn't know how to coordinate a brigade level offensive either, they've been civilians for a decade or more and their training and experiences were shit beforehand. \n\n>If the UAF was a force with not a competent colonel in sight, I feel like Kofman's recommendation would not be \"yeah they should take the wheel and do it their way\".\n\nHis way is the one that doesn't require competence at the higher tactical levels. I'm sure there are some good colonels, there always are. But enough to launch major offensive operations? Maybe there aren't, especially if it's not warped understanding of mission command but simply because they don't know how.\n\nLikely the ones that are good are the better veteran units. I doubt much if any prewar experiences would have prepared them. But definitely since the war started. Not all veteran units are created equally. But take the Kharkiv counteroffensive ones. All had been fighting for months already, some for many months. Quite a few had already done offensive ops before. They obviously got the experience from the Kharkiv counteroffensive and then the exploitation. I bet the battalion and brigade staffs were much better at coordination than brand new units who never even did a brigade level training exercise before. Especially before they got chewed to pieces in Bakhmut.\n\n>Part of the reason I think Kofman is fine with Ukraine sticking to these small-level pushes is they're not necessarily that terrible in the kind of war this is. Ukraine's probably been using them before, and we know Russia's been doing them constantly. 9 times out of 10, you get bit in the ass for massing. \n\nBut if you can't mass, you can't do shit. You can't get results. Even a squad or platoon attacking, they can't accomplish much alone. If they're dismounted, logistics is extremely hard. They're slow as hell. Etc. If they wanted to be more effective just doing dismounted ops, they'd need more dismounts. But then they get spotted, and same as the AFV, targeted. \n\nThese tactics aren't really working. They're making tiny bit of progress but it needs to be more than that because this offensive isn't about moving just enough to get a village or town right in front of them, like Bakhmut. It's about moving about 50 km. \n\nBut they can't do it massed in vehicles because they can't/won't plan that way. They can't do it smaller scale with vehicles because they can't figure out how to counter ATGM threat and mines. Somehow the dismounted squads and platoons can make it through the mines to make some progress doing assaults, and I have no clue why arty, mortars, and machine guns aren't chewing them up, but they can't reinforce them. Probably because it'll turn into a massacre if suddenly companies or battalions of infantry are advancing; if the Russians spot a big attack they'll respond, whereas they're not responding to pinpricks. \n\n>Hey, you already know the answer, and it's the a-word.\n\nAtomic bomb is the only a-word that would work.

                    "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>500 days. All this time they&#39;ve not done one battalion-level push?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They surely have, but when reports are saying brigades or battalions are attacking might not be an accurate description. It can just be subordinate units all essentially fighting their own battles because they can&#39;t coordinate at the higher levels.Or won&#39;t. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not sure on the first point, but there are enough people talking to the UAF troops during this offensive, including officers, who are the ones saying it. </p>\n\n<p>As for the second point, what if they won&#39;t coordinate because they think they shouldn&#39;t? </p>\n\n<p>I mentioned the other day that if there is a legit big push for Mission Command in the UAF, coupled with the fact that the UAF officer corps has some problems with standards and training, which also means education, what does mission command look like to someone who doesn&#39;t fully understand military operations? It looks like decentralized units each fighting their own fight because true mission command is antethema to coordination. </p>\n\n<p>Mission Command works best during highly fluid maneuver warfare, but it&#39;s ass backwards for set piece battles, which is what a combined arms breach is. You can&#39;t give a one paragraph order to a subordinate, only giving them a basic mission and objective, and call it a day. Great when it&#39;s impossible for higher HQs to coordinate the fight because of fog of war, communication lag, etc. But certain types of operations, it can&#39;t work.</p>\n\n<p>The US military talks up Mission Command, but we rarely do it in combat. Can you imagine trying to launch the Desert Storm offensive where every commander from corps to platoon can do things as they like? Trying to clear Fallujah where every platoon can do it as they please? We don&#39;t do it mostly because our officers are trained to know when not to use it. And most of the time it doesn&#39;t work, actual tight coordination is necessary. </p>\n\n<p>What if the Ukrainians don&#39;t realize this? What if it&#39;s not just a matter of not knowing how to coordinate a brigade attack? Which isn&#39;t that hard (the Iraqis and Iranians could both do it).

Both use the 3:1 combined arms set up at the battalion level (3 motor-rifle companies, 1 tank company, or vice versa) for example, and the Ukrainians even call these combined arms battalions BTGs, supposedly.

Kofman has said that this war is basically an attritional struggle between a small Soviet army and a big Soviet Army. Just to be clear, the Soviet Army unlike its modern counterparts, was a **maneuver-oriented artillery army, with a lot of tanks (and nuclear weapons)**, whereas say for the modern Russian and Ukrainian forces, who have both seen its legacy Soviet vehicle park decimated by a combination of attrition and mismanagement, artillery is treated as the principle maneuver element, as opposed to say the U.S. Army, where maneuver is used to exploit the effects/results created by fires. In this case, where overwhelming firepower is not only the preference, but often times, the backbone of offensive operations, who do you think is going to eventually come out on top in the long run? The side with the overall fires advantage, and ability to replace lost personnel (which the VSRF is not good at, but lucky for them, the Ukrainians suck at that too).\n\nOne final point. Anyone who isn't wearing ideological blinders can see that Russian military incompetence is systemic (caused by a combination of underfunding, corruption, a brutal barracks culture that demands huge personal sacrifices from the enlisted ranks, while officers assume personas of infallibility, i.e., senior commanders are protected from responsibility for military failures, etc) but when the Ukrainians suffer from the same problems, their supporters make up all sorts of nonsense excuses for them. When Ukrainians screw everything up by not taking the time to prepare and train their personnel, there's always a ready excuse.

            "body": "I'm genuinely surprised by the scant attention Poland's extraordinary defense spending is receiving. At present, it appears they're on track to allocate approximately 20% of their GDP to new military hardware purchases. The total defense spending is expected to be significantly higher, as hardware purchases typically account for merely 30% of the lifetime costs incurred. This level of spending is staggering! This is an EU/NATO country! I'm baffled as to why this isn't being discussed more widely.\n\nIn my opinion, there were a lot of closed-door meetings between EU countries about how to respond to the invasion of Ukraine. Poland's leadership was likely involved in discussions - and Poland's takeaway from these meetings was rather bleak: should Poland face an attack from Russia, and if the U.S. were to refrain from intervening (for instance, if Trump were reelected and withdrew from NATO), neither Berlin nor Paris would come to Poland's aid. Instead, they would likely pressure Warsaw to make territorial concessions to Russia and give up its resistance (I'm sure Macron would offer to call Putin on Poland's behalf).\n\nThis would echo the events of 1939 for Poland. In 1939 despite a military alliance with the UK and France, these alliances proved useless in preventing an invasion by Germany and then by USSR. Neither the UK nor France offered significant help, leading to an occupation of Poland by the USSR that lasted approximately 50 years. Clearly, Warsaw does not want a repeat of that.\n\n---\n\nRegarding the extensive military hardware that Poland is purchasing, and the question of whether PL's military will be able to effectively integrate & utilize it:\n\nBased on what I've previously mentioned, I believe that Warsaw perceives its best chance of averting a Russian invasion lies in two factors: (1) deterring Moscow (for instance: 500 HIMARS), and (2) preventing the fall of Ukraine. If Ukraine remains resistant to Russian control, the likelihood of Poland being invaded by Putin becomes nearly infinitesimal.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m genuinely surprised by the scant attention Poland&#39;s extraordinary defense spending is receiving. At present, it appears they&#39;re on track to allocate approximately 20% of their GDP to new military hardware purchases. The total defense spending is expected to be significantly higher, as hardware purchases typically account for merely 30% of the lifetime costs incurred. This level of spending is staggering! This is an EU/NATO country! I&#39;m baffled as to why this isn&#39;t being discussed more widely.</p>\n\n<p>In my opinion, there were a lot of closed-door meetings between EU countries about how to respond to the invasion of Ukraine. Poland&#39;s leadership was likely involved in discussions - and Poland&#39;s takeaway from these meetings was rather bleak: should Poland face an attack from Russia, and if the U.S. were to refrain from intervening (for instance, if Trump were reelected and withdrew from NATO), neither Berlin nor Paris would come to Poland&#39;s aid. Instead, they would likely pressure Warsaw to make territorial concessions to Russia and give up its resistance (I&#39;m sure Macron would offer to call Putin on Poland&#39;s behalf).</p>\n\n<p>This would echo the events of 1939 for Poland. In 1939 despite a military alliance with the UK and France, these alliances proved useless in preventing an invasion by Germany and then by USSR. Neither the UK nor France offered significant help, leading to an occupation of Poland by the USSR that lasted approximately 50 years. Clearly, Warsaw does not want a repeat of that.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Regarding the extensive military hardware that Poland is purchasing, and the question of whether PL&#39;s military will be able to effectively integrate &amp; utilize it:</p>\n\n<p>Based on what I&#39;ve previously mentioned, I believe that Warsaw perceives its best chance of averting a Russian invasion lies in two factors: (1) deterring Moscow (for instance: 500 HIMARS), and (2) preventing the fall of Ukraine. If Ukraine remains resistant to Russian control, the likelihood of Poland being invaded by Putin becomes nearly infinitesimal. Thus, I surmise that Poland envisages its hardware purchases to serve as an armory in support of Ukraine&#39;s resistance to Putin. No matter the outcome (even if the US abandons Ukraine), Poland is intent on being in a position where it alone can support Kyiv against Russia. I suspect they will mothball most of the newly acquired equipment, storing it in a warehouse to be dispatched to Ukraine should the need arise.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Edit: for context, even Samuel Sharap (RAND, &quot;famous&quot; for his pre-invasion take on Ukraine <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/01/21/weapons-ukraine-russia-invasion-military/\">&quot;The West\u2019s Weapons Won\u2019t Make Any Difference to Ukraine&quot;</a>) a few day ago: </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/scharap/status/1682847288345911299\">https://twitter.com/scharap/status/1682847288345911299</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Putin rant on Poland with set propaganda piece from Naryshkin does not bode well...It&#39;s one thing for Soloviev to say things like that, but what&#39;s the point of making a big show of this at a televised Security Council meeting unless something is in the works...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Edit 2: I contend that Poland&#39;s decision to refrain from purchasing any military hardware from France or Germany is not a coincidence, nor is it due to the EU&#39;s defense production failing to meet Warsaw&#39;s needs.

It has handled roughly a third of Ukraine's grain exports since the start of the war.\n\nTransit pressure will mount on Constanta, which traditionally handles Romania's crop exports and those of its landlocked neighbours, including Hungary and Serbia.\n\nOverall, it handled 15.25 million metric tonnes of grains in the first six months of this year, a 24.5% increase on the same time last year, the Constanta Port Authority told Reuters.\n\nUkrainian grains accounted for 7.5 million tonnes of the total. By comparison, Romanian port operators handled 8.6 million tonnes of Ukrainian grain in the whole of 2022.\n\nViorel Panait, the manager of port operator Comvex (CMVX.BX) and the president of the Constanta Port Business Association, told Reuters a lag in domestic grain harvesting and the reluctance of some Romanian farmers to sell their crops at low prices meant capacity would be available for Ukrainian grain until mid-August.\n\n\"Harvesting in Romania starts slightly later than in Ukraine, which generates a pause between the two crops,\" Panait said. \"And some Romanian farmers are still holding onto their crops, so sales are stagnating at the moment.\"\n\n\"This creates an availability of logistic capacity that Ukraine could benefit from.\"\n\nPanait also said operators of grain terminals have increased investment in equipment and management to boost operating capacity compared with the start of the war. At its peak so far, Constanta handled 25 million tonnes of grain per year, which Panait said will be exceeded in 2023.\n\n\"There is an accelerated course and everyone on it, the state, the port authority, port operators aim to boost operating and transit speeds, and the grain quantities,\" he said.\n\nPanait said Comvex, which doubled its barge unloading capacity last year, is raising its grain storage capacity by 25% to 250,000 tonnes in an upgrade expected to take about eight months.\n\nFreight logistics group TTS (TTS.BX), which handles agricultural products, minerals and chemicals on the Danube river, completed the takeover of Constanta port solid bulk cargo operator Decirom S.A. earlier this month. TTS said it will invest 10 million euros ($11.12 million) to increase its operating speed by 2024.\n\nPanait also said some port operators are using a digital system, which has reduced the time required to process customs statements to 30 minutes from up to 48 hours.\n\nUkraine has boosted capacity at its Danube ports of Reni and Izmail, and talks were being held with railcar operators on a new reloading system at the Ukrainian-Romanian border crossing of Vadul Siret-Dornesti, Panait said.\n\n\"We're talking real progress.\"",

It is when similar repeated mistakes happen you really need to remove them.  It isn&#39;t like Ukraine is swimming in mass amounts of commanders or quality-trained troops.</p>\n</div>",

These two streams would then meet at approx. the same time - when pilots and crews were trained, logistical problems solved, and jets ready to be deployed. Soon after the announcement (maybe hours or days), we would see Gripen or F-16s conducting missions (in the same way as happened with Storm Shadow). Instead, when all the announcements were made and it proved not to be the catalyst for WW3, what did we actually find out? That fucking none of this training had even been put in place, that nothing had been done, that for all the talk of how grave the threat was, for all the advice of analysts, basically fuck all had been done. I still can't quite believe it. In WW2 the UK was shipping Hurricanes 8 weeks - 8 WEEKS - to the Soviets after Barbarossa started. If Ukraine is very very lucky, they will receive F-16s 96 - 100 weeks after Russia invaded.\n\nBiden won't even give the ATACMs, even after the Kakhovka atrocity. If he wants something left in the bag as a negotiating chip to prevent a Zap NPP dirty bomb (a legitimate political strategy) then that should be Tomahawk.\n\nUkraine has lost the equivalent of an entire mechanised brigade visually confirmed. Yeah, they may have inflicted 1:1 losses on the enemy, but the Russian's entire plan is to hold territory by pouring meat onto the first line of contact, inflict a good attrition ratio, then freeze the conflict. From a bigger force, uncaring for the welfare of their soldiers or population, they can afford to take these losses. If the Ukrainian goal is destroy Russian combat power at a favourable rate rather than take territory and manoeuvre (or indeed demonstrate to their Western donors that they can use NATO gear effectively), then the heavily mined and fortified southern front is the worst place to do it. So Ukraine's goal must be what everyone assumes - cutting off the Melitipol area and isolating Crimea. At these rates of losses, if they don't achieve a breakthrough soon - which god-willing they will do in the next few days or this coming week - they cannot sustain this advance or anywhere near a favourable rate of attrition.\n\nThere is no guarantee that European countries, having failed miserably in 16 months to ramp up armaments production, will supply more heavy weapons. The EU still can't provide arms manufacturers contract guarantees for 155mm - its unbelievable! The Ukrainians must be incredibly furious that while their allies publicly state they understand the gravity of the situation, their actual defence policies suggest otherwise. The UK has led in giving vital equipment, but when you analyse our wider defence strategy, where are the increases in shell production, or ATGM production, or speeding up the Chally 3 program, or basically any changes at all to our pre-invasion procurement strategy? Great, we give 14 tanks, but we have about another 150 operational. Can we give another 30, with ammo and tank transporters? 'But we need them' say the MoD. Why? 'Well, to fight a Russian attack in Europe'. RIGHT, good shit big brains. Will we build any more? Of course not, for some utterly baffling reason.\n\nIf the offensive stalls or the Ukrainians pursue a long term attrition strategy (which might be a valid choice given Prigozhin et al) I fear some countries will shrug and say 'we gave them what we could, now there will have to be negotiations' and then as soon as possible get that Russian gas and fertiliser.\n\nMy deep hope is that this is the moment of maximum attrition for the attacking brigades, as they take the necessary hits to breach the forward defensive lines that the Russians seem to be (rather bafflingly) committing alot of resources to defending.",

Not only will the loss of economies of scale make it far more expensive to refuel a gasoline or diesel engine, but repair facilities and spare parts in circulation will be affected too. More importantly, the purchasing cost of EVs are quickly falling (especially in China), and will be *below* that of ICE vehicles within a few years. Given that operating costs and total cost of ownership are already lower for EVs, the transition to electric road transportation will be far more rapid and brutal than most seem to be willing to imagine.

That the Soviets achieved overall parity and overwhelming superiority in Europe in the 70s is a popular opinion, and not without merits. \n\nThe Soviet army at that time had just transitioned from relying on towed artillery to having a fairly large SPG contingent, and were producing T72s en masse while the US still struggled with M60s. Airpower wise they fielded new models such as the MiG 23s, and were introducing the S-200 which was a fairly capable AA platform.\n\nHow about the US? Well let's just say Vietnam bled them dry, emptying out many of the American units stationed in Europe. US capabilities around the globe degraded significantly and it was questionable whether they could've helped Western Europe defend against a Soviet onslaught.\n\nEdit: This WarCollege thread provides some really good answer on how much the adventure in Vietnam wrecked the US militarily.

        "body": "\nBeijing Is Going Places\u2014and Building Naval Bases\nHere are the top destinations that might be next. \nForeign Policy Magazine \n\nhttps://foreignpolicy.com/2023/07/27/china-military-naval-bases-plan-infrastructure/\n\nChina famously built its first overseas base, a launchpad for the People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), in Djibouti in 2017. Where will it build the next one?\n\nTo answer that question, the authors drew on a new AidData data set that focuses on ports and infrastructure construction financed by Chinese state-owned entities in low- and middle-income countries between 2000 and 2021 and implemented between 2000 and 2023. The detailed data set captures 123 seaport projects at 78 ports in 46 countries, worth a combined $29.9 billion.\n\nA core assumption of our analysis is that Chinese financing and construction of harbor and related infrastructure, either through foreign aid or investment, is one indicator of ports or bases that might serve the PLAN in times of peace or war. And with reason: Chinese law mandates that nominally civilian ports provide logistic support to the Chinese navy if, as, and when needed. Financial ties established through port construction and expansion are enduring, with a long-term life cycle to the relationship. Beijing also sees a corresponding nonmonetary debt to its outlays: The larger the investment, the more leverage China should have to ask for favors.\n\nOur data reveals that China is a maritime superpower ashore as well as afloat, with extraordinary ties in the world\u2019s low- and middle-income countries. Chinese state-owned banks have lent $499 million to expand the port of Nouakchott, Mauritania, a nation where the total GDP is around $10 billion. Freetown, in Sierra Leone, has seen its port financed to the tune of $759 million, in a country where total GDP is $4 billion. It is a worldwide portfolio, stretching even to the Caribbean. The symbolic beachhead there is Antigua and Barbuda, where in late 2022, Chinese entities spent $107 million to complete the expansion of wharfage and sea walls at St. John\u2019s Port, dredge the harbor, and build shoreside facilities.\n\nDrawing a connection between an ostensibly commercial investment and future naval bases may seem odd to those unfamiliar with China\u2019s way of doing business. But a Chinese port construction or operating company can be traded on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and also be an official government entity. Among the major players in port construction is China Communications Construction Company, Ltd. (CCCC), a majority state-owned, publicly traded, multinational engineering and construction company. One of its port subsidiaries is China Harbour Engineering Company, Ltd. (CHEC). Both are major players in building ports overseas.

SOURCE: AIDDATA/WILLIAM & MARY\n\nOusting or outflanking the United States in the Western Pacific is a priority for Beijing, as is challenging the United States, India, and the rest of the so-called Quad alliance in the Indian Ocean. And more than half of our shortlist is indeed Indo-Pacific-oriented, as is Djibouti. What\u2019s surprising is the intensity of Chinese investment, including in ports, on the Atlantic side of Africa. Factoring in Chinese port operators, China is more active across a greater number of ports on the Atlantic side of Africa than on the Indian Ocean, where so much geopolitical attention has been focused. China has been building ports from Mauritania southward around West Africa, through the Gulf of Guinea, and to Cameroon, Angola, and Gabon.\n\nA base in West or Central Africa would be a bold play for a navy that is still getting its blue-water legs just 15 years after learning how to operate far from home, in the anti-piracy missions in the Gulf of Aden. Atlantic bases would put the PLAN in relative proximity to Europe, the Strait of Gibraltar, and key trans-Atlantic shipping lanes. And a shift to the Atlantic would be against the run of play. The United States has been obsessed with the Indo-Pacific, inking the AUKUS security partnership with the U.K. and Australia, deepening logistics ties with India, returning to the Philippines and the Solomon Islands, and cooperating on defense with Papua New Guinea. A PLAN base in the Atlantic would wrong-foot the naval calculus of Washington and Brussels, and send planners back to the drawing board.\n\nWe also find that China likes to put its ports in out-of-the-way places. One example is Beijing\u2019s heavy investment in the port of Caio, an exclave province of Angola. Sometimes there are simple explanations: a lack of natural harbors of sufficient depth of water, or proximity to natural resources. But according to one shipping executive, Chinese entities in the past have seen their ports exposed to labor strife, public protests, and other disruptions, and so now prefer to distance themselves from these situations. Chinese entities likely prefer secure new locations where they can ensure majority and unfettered control or avoid a host country\u2019s public opinion backlash. These would also be selling points in determining where to locate a naval facility.\n\nMore on our top eight most likely PLAN bases, highlighted on the map:",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Beijing Is Going Places\u2014and Building Naval Bases\nHere are the top destinations that might be next. \nForeign Policy Magazine </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/07/27/china-military-naval-bases-plan-infrastructure/\">https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/07/27/china-military-naval-bases-plan-infrastructure/</a></p>\n\n<p>China famously built its first overseas base, a launchpad for the People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), in Djibouti in 2017. Where will it build the next one?</p>\n\n<p>To answer that question, the authors drew on a new AidData data set that focuses on ports and infrastructure construction financed by Chinese state-owned entities in low- and middle-income countries between 2000 and 2021 and implemented between 2000 and 2023. The detailed data set captures 123 seaport projects at 78 ports in 46 countries, worth a combined $29.9 billion.</p>\n\n<p>A core assumption of our analysis is that Chinese financing and construction of harbor and related infrastructure, either through foreign aid or investment, is one indicator of ports or bases that might serve the PLAN in times of peace or war. And with reason: Chinese law mandates that nominally civilian ports provide logistic support to the Chinese navy if, as, and when needed. Financial ties established through port construction and expansion are enduring, with a long-term life cycle to the relationship. Beijing also sees a corresponding nonmonetary debt to its outlays: The larger the investment, the more leverage China should have to ask for favors.</p>\n\n<p>Our data reveals that China is a maritime superpower ashore as well as afloat, with extraordinary ties in the world\u2019s low- and middle-income countries. Chinese state-owned banks have lent $499 million to expand the port of Nouakchott, Mauritania, a nation where the total GDP is around $10 billion. Freetown, in Sierra Leone, has seen its port financed to the tune of $759 million, in a country where total GDP is $4 billion. It is a worldwide portfolio, stretching even to the Caribbean. The symbolic beachhead there is Antigua and Barbuda, where in late 2022, Chinese entities spent $107 million to complete the expansion of wharfage and sea walls at St. John\u2019s Port, dredge the harbor, and build shoreside facilities.</p>\n\n<p>Drawing a connection between an ostensibly commercial investment and future naval bases may seem odd to those unfamiliar with China\u2019s way of doing business. But a Chinese port construction or operating company can be traded on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and also be an official government entity. Among the major players in port construction is China Communications Construction Company, Ltd. (CCCC), a majority state-owned, publicly traded, multinational engineering and construction company. One of its port subsidiaries is China Harbour Engineering Company, Ltd. (CHEC). Both are major players in building ports overseas. In 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce sanctioned CCCC for its role in constructing artificial islands in the South China Sea.</p>\n\n<p>To narrow down the basing options, we applied other criteria too, including strategic location, size of port and depth of water, and potential host country relations with Beijing\u2014measured, for example, by alignment in voting in the U.N.

        "body": "People often talk about what the actual war/fighting between China and the US over the Taiwan Strait would be like, but I'm curious if anyone's given any thought to the aftermath of such a war, \ndepending on the outcome of such a clash.\n\nI think it is in both parties' interest to avoid war at all costs. But it's clear that China wants Taiwan to reunify as a point of national pride. The Chinese want Taiwan for cultural and political reasons. \n\nOf course, there are many unknowns to how a war would play out. Unknowns include:\n\n* Whether the Chinese ask Taiwan to surrender first or launch an attack without warning;\n* The efficacy of Chinese anti-ship missiles and other weapons against the US/Taiwanese navies;\n* How much Taiwan would resist an actual invasion;\n* Whether the Chinese decide to launch a first strike against US military bases in the Pacific or not;\n* Whether the US would even come to Taiwan's aid militarily if the Chinese attacked Taiwan alone.\n\nSo let's say for the point of this thought exercise that war goes something like this:\n\n1. China gives Taiwan a 24-hour ultimatum to reunify now or face the possibility of war.\n2. Taiwan refuses such an entreaty to surrender and readies its military forces, while calling the US for support.\n3. The US warns China against attacking, readies its forces and says that everything, from severe sanctions to the closing the Strait of Malaca, are on the table if the Chinese attack Taiwan.\n4. China warns the US to back off as Taiwan is an internal matter. US fires back rhetorically by saying that Taiwan is a sovereign ally of the United States.\n5. Taiwan refuses China's ultimatum. \n6. China launches a barrage of both cruise and ballistic missiles against Taiwan while taking deep care not to strike any US ships or military installations in the Pacific. They also cut as many telecommunications cables as possible between Taiwan and the rest of the world that they have access to. They do not launch an amphibious invasion, but instead hope to show Taiwan that resistance is futile. \n7. The US decides not to fire back but closes the Strait of Malaca to commercial vessels bringing oil and other goods to China. These ships are forced to turn back by the US Navy. \n8. The US Navy escorts ships carrying supplies to Taiwan's western coast. The Chinese are frustrated that their missile barrage, while initially successful, are seeing diminishing returns as Taiwan relocates weapons and material underground. They start hitting Taiwanese commercial ports in a bid to reduce the efficacy of resupply. This is moderately successful as commercial freighters arrive to see port facilities damaged and are unable to easily offload their goods. Some commercial cargo ships are also sunk, despite the US Navy's best attempts to defend them. But many get through. The Taiwanese are defiant and also manage to hit a few targets in China with their missiles. Meanwhile China is running low on missiles and there is debate internally among the Politburo as to whether or not to engage the US Navy directly. Oil and other supplies grow short due to the US-led blockade of the Strait of Malaca.\n9. The Chinese want to send a message to Taiwan to tell them that resistance is futile, and that the US cannot adequately protect them. To achieve this, they attack a US Navy carrier group situated near the Taiwan Strait with anti-ship missiles. They are successful, disabling a carrier and an escort ship. Several hundred sailors are killed. The carrier does not sink but is no longer operational and must return to Norfolk for repairs. Several F35s are also destroyed.\n10. Congress votes to declare war on China. Meanwhile on the US home front, inflation grows as Chinese-made consumer goods grow scarce. The federal government encourages people to scrounge their closets for second-hand consumer goods to resell.\n11. The Chinese Navy has largely stayed very close to the Chinese coastline, using its ships as mobile firing platforms against Taiwanese ground targets. But as the US fires cruise missiles at Chinese naval bases, they feel compelled to sail out and act. A Chinese carrier group has identified a US carrier group firing cruise missiles at Ningbo, which is home to a major Chinese naval base. \n12. This carrier group receives several barrages of anti-ship missiles but sail in zigzag patterns to avoid being hit and the Chinese attack is ultimately unsuccessful. CIWS systems shoot a few slower enemy missiles down. Chinese cruise missiles have excellent range, but the Chinese find that these missiles cannot easily change their trajectories once coordinates are locked in and they are in flight. Most US Navy ships stay out of naval ports in Japan and other friendly countries for fear of being hit. The Chinese likewise also avoid attacking these ports directly as not to antagonize third parties like Japan and South Korea, who have condemned Chinese aggression but have remained neutral so far besides offering the US passive support. Following the first attack on a US carrier, the Chinese have difficulty locating further US ships to attack as they are constantly moving. They try using submarines to identify targets but some of these submarines are sunk by US attack submarines operating in and around the Taiwan Strait. \n13. The Chinese fire several long-range missiles at Guam in hopes of denying its facilities to the US Navy but damage is limited. \n14. The tempo of Chinese missile strikes against Taiwan slows down. Most US Navy ships try to stay well out of range of Chinese land-based anti-ship missiles. The US, possessing superior targeting capabilities, identify a Chinese carrier sailing along China's coast and disable it with several cruise missiles. \n15. The Politburo decide that they cannot win in Taiwan and ask for a ceasefire, to which the US and Taiwan oblige. The US re-opens the Strait of Malaca and remove some of the more onerous financial sanctions against China. Status quo ante bellum is achieved, and the US maintains its hegemonic position over the world.",

The US, possessing superior targeting capabilities, identify a Chinese carrier sailing along China&#39;s coast and disable it with several cruise missiles. </li>\n<li>The Politburo decide that they cannot win in Taiwan and ask for a ceasefire, to which the US and Taiwan oblige. The US re-opens the Strait of Malaca and remove some of the more onerous financial sanctions against China. Status quo ante bellum is achieved, and the US maintains its hegemonic position over the world.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>",

Also, if somebody tries to negotiate with them, they interpret it as weakness, that is it\u2019s time to push more. And if they are behind, they also aren\u2019t keen to negotiate because they expect the same. </p>\n\n<p>Their goals are clear, and even if there will be a \u201cceasefire\u201d , it\u2019s just going to be a short interlude before the resumption of the total war.</p>\n</div>",
