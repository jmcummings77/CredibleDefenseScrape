I can't think of an English phrase in common usage that really describes this kind of treatment.

Not to everybody, or often, or at random. Just to whoever they want to do it to.\n\nPerhaps you annoy someone, perhaps your political views are to be discredited, perhaps your business is a competitor to somebody who's well connected, whatever your non-crime is, there's probably a **\"**crime**\"** on the books you can be convicted of.\n\nThinking about this as ordinary enforcement of ordinary Russian laws intended to wisely govern Russian society, except that we westerners maybe don't agree with how awesome their drug laws are, and *maybe* this particular case has a bit of a political underpinning - is to fundamentally misunderstand how the Russian state functions.

Perhaps because the anglosphere mostly lives under the rule of law, rather than the rule <em>by</em> law.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Selective enforcement&quot;, or &quot;discretion&quot;, are words we might use, but they are a bit banal, or perhaps we even feel we&#39;d welcome our officials using a bit of discretion, and so they don&#39;t really do it <em>justice</em>.</p>\n\n<p><em>&quot;Overall ... politically motivated&quot;</em> is a very western way of looking at this.</p>\n\n<p>The letter of Russian law (if any reading of it truly does stretch to this treatment, which I suspect may be stretching it considerably) exists in large part to give the state a tool (an excuse) to do exactly this kind of thing. Not to everybody, or often, or at random. Just to whoever they want to do it to.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps you annoy someone, perhaps your political views are to be discredited, perhaps your business is a competitor to somebody who&#39;s well connected, whatever your non-crime is, there&#39;s probably a <strong>&quot;</strong>crime<strong>&quot;</strong> on the books you can be convicted of.</p>\n\n<p>Thinking about this as ordinary enforcement of ordinary Russian laws intended to wisely govern Russian society, except that we westerners maybe don&#39;t agree with how awesome their drug laws are, and <em>maybe</em> this particular case has a bit of a political underpinning - is to fundamentally misunderstand how the Russian state functions. And, to be frank, it&#39;s really the <em>Party Line</em> here that even many Russians only half pretend to believe.</p>\n</div>",

The breakthrough agreement between bitter rivals was promptly blessed by the administration of President Joe Biden, which eased some sanctions hours later, allowing US driller Chevron Corp. to pump more oil in the country.\n\n>It was the most tangible evidence yet that Washington and its allies in Venezuela have changed course when it comes to Maduro, an authoritarian leader so despised only a few years ago that the Trump administration put a $15 million reward out for his arrest and slapped sanctions on his administration.\n\n>After years of failed US attempts at fostering regime change, Biden envoys began talks with the Maduro government in March, shortly after Washington banned Russian energy imports in response to President Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The dialogue paved the way for a prisoner exchange in October. The US also demanded that Maduro restart negotiations with the opposition as a condition for any future concessions.\n\n>The rapprochement is driven, in part, by the Biden administration\u2019s desire to do whatever it can to smooth out oil market disruptions that have sent prices soaring. Although years of government mismanagement has decimated Venezuela\u2019s petroleum industry\u2014oil production now averages about 690,000 barrels a day, compared with more than 2 million a day in 2017\u2014the country still sits atop the world\u2019s largest reserves.\n\n>The overtures to Caracas are also a tacit acknowledgment of the failure of the policy under President Donald Trump to push out Maduro by supporting opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3. \u201cGlobal energy prices are one of several factors driving US policy toward Venezuela, but the recent engagement also stems from a desire to break the diplomatic stalemate around Guaid\u00f3,\u201d says Eurasia Group analyst Risa Grais-Targow.\n\n>No one expects California-based Chevron to return the country to its past glory as an oil powerhouse or meaningfully ease the global energy crunch. One of the last international companies to stick it out after 2019, when the US blocked transactions with state oil company Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela SA, Chevron had effectively stopped pumping oil in Venezuela. Within a year, it may be able to ramp up output to about 200,000 barrels a day in the four joint ventures it operates with PDVSA. The additional production won\u2019t offset the disruption caused by sanctions on Russia, which exports as much as 3 million barrels a day.\n\n>The bigger winner is Maduro. Three years ago he was isolated internationally, Venezuela\u2019s economy was in the throes of a seven-year recession, and hyperinflation made its currency worthless. About 7 million people have fled the country during his tenure, and per-capita gross domestic product is less than a quarter of what it was a decade ago, but as the 60-year-old leader nears a decade in power, the worst of the crisis appears to have passed.\n\n>Maduro is traveling internationally, including a visit to the recent climate summit in Egypt, where he wrangled a handshake with US envoy John Kerry and exchanged pleasantries with French President Emmanuel Macron. Newly elected left-of-center governments in Latin America are restoring relations with his government. At home, Caracas streets once packed with protesters demanding he step down are filling with new restaurants and advertisements for concerts and upscale stores.\n\n>The recession is over, thanks mainly to the government\u2019s decision in 2019 to allow the US dollar to circulate alongside the bol\u00edvar. GDP is forecast to expand 7.6% this year, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists, and 3.9% in 2023.\n\n>Negotiating with the US helps Maduro improve his standing on the global stage, says Luis Vicente Le\u00f3n, director of Caracas consultants Datanalisis. \u201cIt opens doors to reestablish some form of a relationship with the US,\u201d he says. \u201cIt could also result in political agreements that allow Maduro to generate some political flexibility that helps him to consolidate a more recognized government in the future.\u201d\n\n>Biden still doesn\u2019t consider Maduro to be Venezuela\u2019s rightful leader because the 2018 presidential election was marred by fraud, continuing his predecessor\u2019s policy of recognizing Guaid\u00f3, the 39-year-old head of the opposition-led National Assembly. But Guaid\u00f3\u2019s standing is falling both at home and abroad. Governments around the world and the European Union have ceased to recognize him, and some of Venezuela\u2019s opposition parties are threatening to withdraw support from his so-called interim government next month. \u201cNow, Biden can adjust the Venezuela foreign policy that Trump designed\u2014which failed\u2014to a more realistic policy that uses sanctions as incentives to negotiate and not as permanent punishment,\u201d says Michael Penfold, professor at the Institute of Advanced Studies in Administration in Caracas.\n\n>Biden officials have said they will further ease sanctions if Maduro continues to make agreements with the opposition in Mexico City. The talks, which restarted last month, were stalled since October 2021 when Maduro walked away. Several previous rounds of negotiations failed to produce any meaningful breakthroughs. This time the opposition and the US are pushing Maduro to set a date for free and fair presidential elections in 2024, to allow some barred politicians to run and to invite foreign electoral observers to monitor the vote.\n\n>Stalin Gonz\u00e1lez, a member of the opposition delegation, says that by negotiating in Mexico, Maduro has a channel to pursue concessions from the US, including sanctions relief. \u201cThe international community is willing, as it has always said, to give these incentives if the demands of the Venezuelan people are met,\u201d he says.\n\n>The infrastructure plan, which uses $3 billion in funds frozen in foreign bank accounts, is a first step, Gonz\u00e1lez says. A few days after he signed it, Maduro held a rare news conference to hail the agreement, saying it would be used to fix 2,300 schools, repair parts of the electricity grid and buy vaccines and medications. At the same time, he cast doubt over the future of the talks by appearing to link electoral conditions to the lifting of US sanctions. \u201cIs it free elections that you want? Fair and transparent?\u201d he said. \u201cTake them all away.\u201d",

Soviet economic growth was pretty impressive until the 1960s and 1970s. The USSR/Russia had significantly higher growth in GDP per capita than the US from 1913 through 1973, even though they: lost a lot of men in a pointless war they didn't start, got invaded and partially occupied by Germany, had two revolutions, had a bloody and brutal 6 year civil war followed by another decade of localized revolts and insurgency, became the personal fief of a paranoid megalomaniac (supported and enabled by [an even more paranoid megalomaniac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavrentiy_Beria)), lost a lot of men in a pointless war they didn't start (again), got invaded and partially occupied by Germany (again), and got into a prolonged cold war against literally every other major world power.\n\nThe USSR gets compared unfavorably to the US economically and in standard of living... but the USSR started way behind the US. It's hard to even compare the 1913 Imperial Russian economy to the US economy, because American per capita GDP was already well above the 1913 Russian figure by the late 1800s when those figures start to become semi-reliable and not just historians' guesstimates.\n\nIt's impressive for the USSR that they were even in the same conversation - much less that the USSR found itself opposed to the US... and the UK, and France, and the less devastated half of Germany, and every other world power of note except China (until China ditched them)... and they held their own for nearly half a century.\n\nIt's not like the average older Russian has seen much increase in the standard of living since 1991. Lines at the supermarket are shorter... but the cradle-to-grave welfare system is gone, too. The USSR offered at least some upward mobility, while Russia doesn't. Quietly corrupt Soviet bureaucrats were probably preferable to blatantly corrupt Russian bureaucrats.\n\nI really wonder how history would have played out if the Soviets fully embraced \"socialism in one state\" and stopped trying to export the revolution and/or fulfill Stalin's paranoid delusions, and the US and western Europe had decided to say \"live and let live\" rather than \"Communismus delendus est!\"",

When you are a \"mafia state\", it's surprisingly easy to actually get local \"mafias\" to cooperate as long as you treat them reasonably well.

Secrecy in tactical forces often *helps* conventional deterrence. To an extent, if your systems are revealed to have a flaw the secrecy becomes a weakness. Thus it has to be carefully managed.

You don\u2019t ever want to use a nuke for any reason ever. Despite the nature of the weapon, they\u2019re purely a defensive system. Thus you are more willing to share the location if bases, announce tests regularly, demonstrate capabilities, and release details not just on the bombs themselves but the weapons they travel on. The goal is to remove all doubt in the enemy\u2019s mind that they can win a nuclear exchange. You want to demonstrate that your weapons have the capability, the range, the dispersion, to strike enemy cities or bases and do major damage.

Even in a total route, though, that just divides the RuAF. To cut off RuAF forces, the UAF has to then swing westward and cut off the western forces by taking the approaches, which are another 90 miles to the west from Melitopol.</p>\n</div>",

            "body": "In the grand scheme of a strategy to take Donetsk, and based on the realities of the Russian situation, taking Bakhmut won't improve their chances.\n\nTo take the oblast requires taking the largest and most important cities, Sloviansk and Kramatorsk. The former was successful holding out against the Izyum axis that was trying to assault it and then outflank it, but that axis is gone. That means the only way to take those is from the east. But the current front lines running from Siversk-Bakhmut-Avdiivka-Pisky-Mariinka block that. To unhinge that line means a breakthrough somewhere and Bakhmut is the most vulnerable location, because it possesses a road leading directly to Sloviansk.\n\nHowever, the Russians aren't strong enough to do anything beyond taking Bakhmut. At best, if they take the city they can push NE towards Siversk, potentially causing a retreat westwards to the high ground east of Sloviansk-Kramatorsk-Kostyantynivka, but it's more likely all routes leading out of Bakhmut already have defenses dug in and ready to be manned by reserves or units in the city pushed out, just in case.\n\nSo why attack at all? It won't accomplish any strategic good, right? Some reasons:\n\n- Prigozhin dick waving, trying to gain power, notoriety, prove he's more dependable than the MOD\n\n- Putin is micromanaging and refuses to cede the initiative, ordering the offensive to continue, hoping to score a success the Russians can boast about, despite it not leading to anything positive\n\n- It's a fixing action, an attack designed to draw the UAF to defend it hoping those units, manpower, equipment, supplies, and staff work are used to defend Bakhmut versus attack in the much more strategic sector of Svatove-Kreminna, which if breached will have dire repercussions for Russia. So Bakhmut becomes a feint, keep the sector hot versus, forcing the UAF to concentrate there, versus let it go cold, and the UAF thins their lines there to reinforce success elsewhere.\n\nI lean towards the latter. As irrational as Russian political and military decision making has been, they have course corrected numerous times. And I don't think the assumptions for a feint are that wild because it's pretty clear since the war started and at this point that the Ukrainians never give up ground unless they can't hold it. Losing Bakhmut would be politically unacceptable at any time, but much more so now that the UAF are being viewed as winning the war. Winners don't lose battles. So even if the UAF knows the Russians can't exploit a tactical or limited operational success taking Bakhmut, they still might be obligated to do what is necessary, whatever the cost, to hold the city.",
            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>In the grand scheme of a strategy to take Donetsk, and based on the realities of the Russian situation, taking Bakhmut won&#39;t improve their chances.</p>\n\n<p>To take the oblast requires taking the largest and most important cities, Sloviansk and Kramatorsk. The former was successful holding out against the Izyum axis that was trying to assault it and then outflank it, but that axis is gone. That means the only way to take those is from the east. But the current front lines running from Siversk-Bakhmut-Avdiivka-Pisky-Mariinka block that. To unhinge that line means a breakthrough somewhere and Bakhmut is the most vulnerable location, because it possesses a road leading directly to Sloviansk.</p>\n\n<p>However, the Russians aren&#39;t strong enough to do anything beyond taking Bakhmut. At best, if they take the city they can push NE towards Siversk, potentially causing a retreat westwards to the high ground east of Sloviansk-Kramatorsk-Kostyantynivka, but it&#39;s more likely all routes leading out of Bakhmut already have defenses dug in and ready to be manned by reserves or units in the city pushed out, just in case.</p>\n\n<p>So why attack at all? It won&#39;t accomplish any strategic good, right? Some reasons:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Prigozhin dick waving, trying to gain power, notoriety, prove he&#39;s more dependable than the MOD</p></li>\n<li><p>Putin is micromanaging and refuses to cede the initiative, ordering the offensive to continue, hoping to score a success the Russians can boast about, despite it not leading to anything positive</p></li>\n<li><p>It&#39;s a fixing action, an attack designed to draw the UAF to defend it hoping those units, manpower, equipment, supplies, and staff work are used to defend Bakhmut versus attack in the much more strategic sector of Svatove-Kreminna, which if breached will have dire repercussions for Russia.
