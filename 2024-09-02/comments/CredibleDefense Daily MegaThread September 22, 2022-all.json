        "body": "Been awhile since I posted here, so wanted to share a few random thoughts\n\n1. The scale of Russian Equipment losses in Kharkiv [appears massive. ](https://twitter.com/ragnarbjartur/status/1572862064200130561) I think what's more telling is how much of this equipment appears to be in a state of partial dismantlement or disrepair. Izyum linked up to a rail-line, if there was anywhere on the front the Russians should be able to refurbish equipment it was here. So why was so much of it in a state of disrepair?\n\n2. Seeing some images of T-62ms being mobilized today. All of this to me paints a picture of what some commentators have been saying for awhile, Russia's supply of equipment is not endless. I think its fruitless to try to speculate how much they have left without actual intelligence, but I also do think we are and are going to continue to see Russian formations impacted by a lack of material quality going forward. \n\n3. On conscripts, lots of focus on the numbers without the fundamentals. The whole driving ethos behind modern armies is that a trained, well-equipped force can decimate an untrained force. I don't think the disparity will be immediately apparent if these conscripts are just used to reinforce the line, but these are not regular soldiers. Even compared to the TDF, I imagine the morale of these units is going to be drastically lower. I also think its possible for a wider morale drop among conscripts/volunteers who've had their terms of service indefinitely extended. Comparisons to WW2 really don't play for me here, the war does not seem to be popular in Russia and I don't think most conscripts could give you good reasons why they should fight/die in Ukraine. Morale matters! \n\n4. The level of political risk for Putin/Russian elite in mobilizing mostly poor ethnic minorities to fight is unclear to me, but seems significant. Especially with the combat power of the Russian military being continually degraded. I think we need to recognize this is in many ways an unprecedented situation for the modern world, *especially* Russia. Comparisons to Tsarist Russia are inappropriate IMO, the world has changed a lot since the 1800s and Russia has not had to endure a mobilization, or losses, like this since WW2.\n\n5. I think with mobilization we will see an in-kind escalation in the types of equipment supplied by the West. It might take a few months to filter through, but I think avoiding this type of mobilization might've been one of the goals of Western military aid and now that blocker is removed. There's a very dangerous setup here for the Russians where they're operating with older/less-effective equipment while the Ukrainians receive higher quality Western stuff.\n\n6. On the flipside, I think folks underestimate how much of an undertaking supporting Western armor is going to be for the AFU. Buy a copy of Steel Beasts and try to learn all of the systems on the M1. Now remember that's a video game, and you also need to learn how to maintain, supply, and recover these vehicles. \n\n7. On the flipside I think folks might also underestimate how much better Western equipment is that equivalent Russian models. On paper something like a Warrior vs. a BMP-2 might appear similar but even on simple things like ergonomics the Warrior is far superior. \n\n8. The longer this conflict goes on the more time the Western MIC has to jury-rig Western technology to fit into the AFU's capabilities/doctrine. We've seen very successful examples of this with HARM, and seemingly less successful examples with Switchblade/Brimstone. Don't underestimate this as a long-term factor, the West has waaaay more brainpower than RU, not impossible to see a wave of Western developed weapons/drones offering big new capabilities to the AFU down the road\n\n9. My impression is the Russian's really missed their window for mobilization. Early in the war they had relatively trained formations, operating with a surplus of equipment and a big deficit of infantry. By waiting this long it seems like they'll be reinforcing decimated formations with varying levels of equipment. There isn't the same degree of a hardened core to reinforce here, and I think that'll impact the ability of conscripts to contribute\n\n10. On a related point, I'm very skeptical of the million men mobilization number being thrown around. Not that Russia couldn't/wouldn't do it, but that it'd be effective. It reminds me of a government identifying a big problem and just throwing a shitload of money at it, without actually having an idea of if it'll fix the problem or not (See Saudia Arabia's NEOM). Does RU have the infrastructure, money, supplies, weapons to handle a million conscripts? Can they actually maintain these troops on the frontline? Who is going to lead and train these soldiers?",

If you lock a lot of young men for a year or two in a place they don't really want to be in, Lord of the Flies shit happens.

Or children of parents who actually believed the army would make a man out of their son. Unsurprisingly, also mostly from lower class families.

                    "body": "I'd say a it's little bit of both, even though China is still probably a decade from overmatching the US at this point.\n\nhttps://interpret.csis.org/translations/science-of-military-strategy-2020-ed-chapter-8-strategic-deterrence/\n\n>China\u2019s strategic deterrence thinking is broad, profound, and unique, which can be summarized in four words: self-defense, limited, flexible, and effective.\n\n>Self-defense means insisting on active defense, \u2018Do not attack unless attacked. If attacked, actively counterattack\u2019. Deterrence, like war, has two distinct properties, that is the distinction between justice and injustice. Using deterrence to gain hegemony, control other countries, invade and expand is unjust; using deterrence to maintain one\u2019s safety, regional stability, and world peace, is just.\n\n>There are three fundamental differences between our country\u2019s strategic deterrence and that of the United States. \n\n>One is that the purpose is different. The purpose of the United States\u2019 use of strategic deterrence is to exert pressure on other countries with powerful military strength, promoting hegemonism and power politics, to serve its global strategy. China does not seek hegemony or aggression, its key to using strategic deterrence lies in curbing foreign aggression, defending China\u2019s sovereignty, security and development interests, and maintaining a peaceful and stable internal and external environment. \n\n>Second, the different status. The United States regards deterrence as a kind of strategy, namely \u201cdeterrence strategy\u201d, that is an essential part of its military strategy. No matter how the government changes or the military strategy changes, the idea of a deterrence strategy based on a strong nuclear force runs and links through the whole process. Although our country also attaches great importance to deterrence, the core of our country\u2019s strategic thinking is active defense, and strategic deterrence is just a means. \n\n>Third, the difference in methods. U.S. strategic deterrence is based on hegemony and expansion, therefore, its application is obviously dynamic and offensive, which can be best demonstrated by the \u2018pre-emptive strike\u2019 strategy proposed and implemented by the United States. Although China\u2019s strategic deterrence also emphasizes striving for the initiative, such initiative is under the overall military and defense strategy. It does not initiate provocation, nor pressure others, but it is forced to be implemented only after being attacked.\n\n\n>Limited refers to the development of limited strategic deterrence forces to achieve limited strategic purposes in accordance with the nature of the country, its comprehensive national power and the basic principles of strategic deterrence. As a large developing socialist country, China cannot and should not engage in an arms race with hegemonic powers. The lesson of the Soviet Union\u2019s unrestrained development of armaments without regard to national strength is extremely profound. Unlike those hegemonic countries, China does not develop a strategic deterrence as a tool to fight for world hegemony, but it is committed to building a reasonable and sufficient strategic force to deter opponents with limited deterrent force and maintain national security.\n\n\n>Flexibility refers to safeguarding national security as a goal, assess the situation despite circumstances, and creatively implement various deterrence methods to maximize the deterrent effect of strategic forces. The flexibility of China\u2019s strategic deterrence application is mainly reflected in three aspects: first, the close combination of principle and flexibility adheres to the basic principle of self-defense and pre-emptive measures, but it does not exclude the flexibility of deterrence application. When national territorial sovereignty is infringed, national unity is challenged, and national development interests are threatened, China has the power to use military means at any time, and can carry out active and effective strategic deterrence to gain a favorable military position. The second is the close integration of military means with political and diplomatic means. Military power is the basic force for implementing strategic deterrence, but it is difficult to obtain the expected deterrent effect by relying on military force alone. Therefore, China\u2019s strategic deterrence emphasizes the flexible use of political and diplomatic means, close cooperation with a strategic deterrence, and strives for a strategic initiative. Third, various means of deterrence are closely integrated. The overall people\u2019s war deterrence and nuclear deterrence are the basic methods of strategic deterrence in China, and the organic combination of the two can produce a tremendous deterrent effect. At the same time, the development and application of diversified strategic deterrence means, will improve the overall effectiveness of deterrence.\n\n\n>Effective, that is, strategic deterrent capable of responding to a wide range of threats and ensuring that the day of defeat is achieved without war. It is important to ensure the effectiveness of deterrence, as our security has long faced threats of different targets and degrees of threat, and to convince any enemy, including strong enemies, that any encroachment or interference with China will be met with due retaliation. This requires that we attach great importance to the issue of deterrence effectiveness in both the construction and employment of our military forces. In force building, to emphasize only the \u201climited\u201d characteristic would be to fall into one-sidedness; limited refers to quantity, and small quantity is based on reliable quality. Mao Zedong, while talking about nuclear weapons said to have \u201ca little more, a little less\u201d, but especially emphasized the need for \u201cbetter\u201d. Therefore, while emphasizing that China\u2019s strategic deterrence is \u201climited\u201d, more emphasis should be placed on its \u201ceffective\u201d characteristic, with nuclear force meeting the requirements for effective retaliation and conventional strategic forces meeting the need to safeguard national sovereignty, security, and development interests. In terms of strategic application, to ensure that strategic deterrence is effective, there must be firm determination and will. Effective warfare has three basic elements: first, a reliable strategic force; second, the determination and will to use strategic force when necessary; and third, a rapid and accurate transmission of information so that the adversary has a correct understanding of these two points. This basic principle of deterrence tells us that the effectiveness of deterrence depends on the right determination, strong will and timely and accurate information transmission, given the established force. The use of strategic deterrence in China emphasizes reason, benefit, and discipline, disbelief, fear of pressure, tit-for-tat, determination, and the courage to fight and win. In the decades of struggle after the founding of New China, we have repeatedly proved with facts that the Chinese are true to their word, established the image of deterrence in China, and safeguarded national interests and world peace with credible and effective strategic deterrence.",

She said that local authorities tried to hand out 20 draft notices, including to several in their 50s. Even if many turned away, would still produce far more than 300k conscripts if repeated across Russia.\n\nI'm increasingly convinced that the dragnet approach to mobilization is being driven by the principal\u2013agent problem.

Russian strikes have taken a toll on Ukraine\u2019s defense industry, but offshoring and the cottage industry are keeping the shells coming.*\n\nhttps://foreignpolicy.com/2022/09/19/ukraine-defense-industry-war-machine-russia/\n\nRussia has targeted Ukraine\u2019s defense industry, from tank plants to logistics facilities, with more than 100 missile strikes since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February. Ukraine\u2019s GDP is set to fall by more than one-third. And all the while, Ukraine has needed to learn how to maintain and service new NATO-grade weapons coming into its arsenal from Western countries.\n\nBut nearly seven months after the invasion aimed at toppling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s government, the country\u2019s defense industry\u2014one of the most robust in the former Soviet Union\u2014has continued to chug along, according to experts and Ukrainian officials. That\u2019s partly by relocating defense production facilities to secure locations, ordering new defense production agreements with European allies like Poland, and the government\u2019s mandated creation of new defense production jobs.\n\nYuriy Gusev, the head of Ukraine\u2019s state-run weapons manufacturer Ukroboronprom, told Foreign Policy in an interview that Ukraine is working with some companies from abroad to offshore production. But as Kyiv is increasingly given NATO-level weapons\u2014more than $15 billion worth from the United States alone since February (nearly three times last year\u2019s defense budget)\u2014Ukraine is looking to build facilities to service those weapons and increasingly becoming a part of the Western military supply chain.\n\n\u201cFrom Feb. 24, we\u2019re working 24/7,\u201d Gusev said. \u201cWe have replaced some of our enterprises because of security issues and missile attacks. We\u2019re working with partners to create maintenance and repair facilities for Western weapons and equipment here in Ukraine.\u201d The potential for more maintenance facilities could help incentivize Western nations to send weapons and equipment more quickly to Ukraine, as NATO members have worried about sending things that the war-torn country isn\u2019t easily able to service.\n\n\u201cWe hope we will be a part of the production line,\u201d Gusev added, also calling for joint research and development centers with Western companies.\n\nEven with Ukraine under attack, taking some facilities offline, the country has cleverly adapted, using small-scale workshops and offshoring production to avoid Russian strikes. Gusev also said companies have tried to hire more and increase salaries to keep defense workers in their jobs; even in World War II, the United States struggled with absenteeism and worker strikes at many major defense companies.\n\n\u201cNecessity is the mother of invention,\u201d said Jeb Nadaner, a former U.S. deputy assistant secretary of defense for industrial policy. \u201cThey have very active networks in Europe and even beyond to keep their workshops moving forward.\u201d\n\nDuring World War II, the United States converted more than 40 percent of its GDP to fight Germany and Japan, and it provided weapons to Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and others through the Lend-Lease program. Even though the Ukrainians are under attack at home and have had a similar percentage of their economic output destroyed by Russian attacks, the mix of older Soviet-era factories allows for quick repairs and modifications. \u201cThey have the remnants of an older industrial base,\u201d Nadaner added. \u201cThink New York, New Jersey, 1965. You have smelters. You have people that can fabricate things.\u201d\n\nAnd as retreating Russian troops have increasingly left more sophisticated weapons behind\u2014including tanks, armored vehicles, and assault rifles\u2014Ukraine has put in place procedures to modify these weapons and use them against their makers. A Ukrainian military official told Foreign Policy last week that Ukraine had captured more than 200 vehicles in its sweep into the Kharkiv region near the Russian border.\n\n\u201cWe have special research institutions, which discover all this Russian equipment and weapons, and we have our own design bureaus, which are looking for that military equipment and weapons from Russia,\u201d Gusev said. But he emphasized that the long game for Ukraine is to receive foreign technology transfers, such as from the United States, and to create joint ventures with global defense companies to produce more efficient weapons.\n\nThe country\u2019s parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, is also considering a new draft law that would make the defense industry a priority industry in an effort to bring in more investment.\n\nBut even with farming out and the potential of foreign help, there are serious threats to keeping production rolling. Damage to Ukraine\u2019s defense industry is just a fraction of the war-torn country\u2019s coming reconstruction bill. Volodymyr Omelyan, a former Ukrainian minister of infrastructure, said the running tally of Russian damage to the country is more than $1 trillion, but he cautioned that the figure was a rough estimate as the fighting continues to wreak havoc on Ukrainian infrastructure.\n\n\u201cWe are still able to produce many types of weapons, but definitely under permanent threat of bombing, you cannot make a real production line,\u201d Omelyan said. He added that the Ukrainian government should try to make offshore arrangements with neighboring NATO countries, such as Poland and Slovakia, and with the help of Western countries, produce artillery ammunition and missiles\u2014with the guarantee that those facilities would come back to Ukraine after the war.\n\nOne Ukrainian military official, speaking on condition of anonymity to talk about ongoing production efforts, said the government had also begun to emphasize defense production facilities in Ukraine\u2019s western reaches\u2014further away, though not completely out of the way, of possible Russian missile strikes. (Much of the then-Soviet Union moved its industrial base east across the Ural Mountains to keep it out of range of Nazi invaders.) This month, Zelensky said the Turkish firm responsible for making low-cost Bayraktar TB-2 drones that were used extensively against Russian armor early in the war will set up a factory in Ukraine to build unmanned aerial vehicles.\n\nCombined with low-level workshop production, experts believe Ukraine\u2019s defense industry can hold out. \u201cA lot of workshops, a lot of motivation,\u201d Nadaner said. \u201cIt\u2019s no substitute for what we\u2019re giving them, no substitute for us growing our defense budget significantly, \u2026 but what they have retained is operating at a much greater production [level] than it did prewar.\u201d\n\nJack Detsch is a Pentagon and national security reporter at Foreign Policy.

Damage to Ukraine\u2019s defense industry is just a fraction of the war-torn country\u2019s coming reconstruction bill. Volodymyr Omelyan, a former Ukrainian minister of infrastructure, said the running tally of Russian damage to the country is more than $1 trillion, but he cautioned that the figure was a rough estimate as the fighting continues to wreak havoc on Ukrainian infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe are still able to produce many types of weapons, but definitely under permanent threat of bombing, you cannot make a real production line,\u201d Omelyan said. He added that the Ukrainian government should try to make offshore arrangements with neighboring NATO countries, such as Poland and Slovakia, and with the help of Western countries, produce artillery ammunition and missiles\u2014with the guarantee that those facilities would come back to Ukraine after the war.</p>\n\n<p>One Ukrainian military official, speaking on condition of anonymity to talk about ongoing production efforts, said the government had also begun to emphasize defense production facilities in Ukraine\u2019s western reaches\u2014further away, though not completely out of the way, of possible Russian missile strikes. (Much of the then-Soviet Union moved its industrial base east across the Ural Mountains to keep it out of range of Nazi invaders.) This month, Zelensky said the Turkish firm responsible for making low-cost Bayraktar TB-2 drones that were used extensively against Russian armor early in the war will set up a factory in Ukraine to build unmanned aerial vehicles.</p>\n\n<p>Combined with low-level workshop production, experts believe Ukraine\u2019s defense industry can hold out. \u201cA lot of workshops, a lot of motivation,\u201d Nadaner said. \u201cIt\u2019s no substitute for what we\u2019re giving them, no substitute for us growing our defense budget significantly, \u2026 but what they have retained is operating at a much greater production [level] than it did prewar.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Jack Detsch is a Pentagon and national security reporter at Foreign Policy.

        "body": "*How Putin\u2019s partial mobilization could backfire. Largely ill-trained, unwilling reservists may hamper Russia\u2019s endeavor to reassert control in its Ukraine campaign*\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/09/22/putin-russia-mobilization-troops-ukraine/\n\nFacing battlefield setbacks, this week Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the partial mobilization of up to 300,000 reservists. Most analysts see this as a move to buy breathing space for his exhausted military \u2014 as well as appease critics in Russia who think the invasion has moved too slowly in Ukraine.\n\nBut the mobilization announcement may be a sign of weakness, not strength. A brilliantly executed Ukrainian counteroffensive near Kharkiv has recaptured nearly 2,300 square miles of Ukrainian land, freeing dozens of villages while inflicting heavy losses on a demoralized Russian army.\n\nSix months into the war, an estimated 40,000 to 80,000 Russian soldiers are dead, wounded or have deserted. Some 6,200 military vehicles, among Russia\u2019s most sophisticated, have been destroyed or abandoned. Deserters and refuseniks now make up an estimated 20 to 40 percent of some front-line units.\n\nWill Russia\u2019s partial mobilization succeed in stemming the tide and increase Russian military effectiveness? My research on the sources of military effectiveness suggests that\u2019s unlikely.\n\nThe devil\u2019s in the details\nMuch depends on how widespread, and how quickly, the mobilization drive unfolds. Russian history offers few precedents, with only two mass mobilization drives, during World War I and II. The formidable Soviet-era mass mobilization system has atrophied over the past decade \u2014 instead, the Kremlin has sought to staff Russia\u2019s wars with a mix of contract soldiers, short-service conscripts, mercenaries and local allies.\n\nHistorically, the Russian army trains its soldiers within their home units \u2014 but many battered units may be ill-equipped to train replacements. Public protests, draft-dodging and outright fleeing suggest that the hoped-for wave of 300,000 soldiers might be more of a trickle.\n\nWhy Russia\u2019s mobilization may lower the risk of nuclear war \u2014 for now\n\nThese new soldiers may not help much on the battlefield\nIn the short term, the new measures might help Russia consolidate its new battlefield position. Most importantly, tucked inside this partial mobilization was an order suspending all short-term service contracts.\n\nSeeking to plug gaps in its forces, the Russian army turned to short-term soldiers who signed lucrative contracts for four to six months of service. Now these soldiers can no longer leave service when their contract expires \u2014 or refuse to deploy to their units.\n\nIf the upcoming hastily scheduled staged referendums go through in Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, Russia will probably claim it can legally deploy Russian conscripts to these contested Ukrainian territories. Once winter sets in, mangled units might be rotated out, enabling them to rest and replenish their ranks (Russia typically leaves units in place until 50 to 60 percent of their original strength is lost).\n\nBut newly mobilized soldiers are likely to be poorly trained, their prior combat experience a distant memory. A high death rate among officers in the Russian army, in part because of deliberate Ukrainian targeting, has left Putin\u2019s military without sufficient trainers.\n\nIn the race to master and implement the lessons of this war, the Ukrainians have surged far head. This means Russian troops will be facing skilled Ukrainian forces that have mastered the tenets of decentralized warfare by small, highly motivated and independent units.\n\nNor does Russia have the equipment stocks to make good on its losses. Ancient tanks cannibalized from Soviet-era stockpiles are already on the front lines; in many cases, the tanks are far older than their operators. If the best equipped and trained Russian forces couldn\u2019t seize Kyiv or hold Kharkiv, it isn\u2019t clear why this second wave would fare any better.\n\nPutin just called up young men to the war. He\u2019s taking a big risk.\n\nWill mobilization worsen Russia\u2019s military problems?\nPartial mobilization risks exacerbating the structural problems inherent within the Russian military, along with military morale. The war has highlighted the importance of combat motivation and the huge disparity between Russian and Ukrainian will to fight. Contract soldiers are likely to resent being forced to fight beyond their contract end date, souring morale even further. Unsure of the war\u2019s purpose, and keen to avoid harm, newly drafted soldiers are likely to be motivated more by survival than nationalism.\n\nA surge of new soldiers also does little to fix Russia\u2019s command structure. Less a military than a collection of warring tribes, the Russian army in Ukraine now comprises at least nine different organizations, including prisoner battalions, pro-Russian Chechens, local militia, the National Guard, regular army units and Wagner Group paramilitaries.\n\nWithout untangling the lines of authority, the infusion of additional soldiers seems highly likely to intensify squabbling across commands for resources \u2014 and worsen coordination and control problems. Of course, the greater the number of soldiers, the faster cascades of desertion and indiscipline might rip through the ranks. Russian commanders might find it necessary to divert incoming soldiers to the task of monitoring other soldiers, an eat-your-tail dynamic that would undermine Russia\u2019s military goals in Ukraine.\n\nPutin\u2019s move is also a political gamble\nPutin\u2019s partial mobilization is also politically risky. The \u201cpartial\u201d nature of the mobilization risks the ire of his nationalist supporters, who could paint him as feckless. Meanwhile, any mobilization risks increasing opposition from those who have so far remained relatively silent about the war.\n\nDoes Putin have to worry? Russian leaders are only rarely overthrown after military defeat. Indeed, since 1800, Russia has lost 17 of the 49 conventional wars it has fought, but domestic opponents removed only two leaders.\n\nBut these undercurrents of opposition bear watching, especially if Putin decides to widen the social base of mobilized soldiers. To date, the war has been fought on the backs of non-Russians and poor Russians from regions far from the bright lights of Moscow and St. Petersburg. A move to alter regional quotas and draw from a more representative sample of Russian citizens might provoke the backlash Putin has been keen to avoid.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible that the specter of a rebuilt Russian army creates incentives for Ukrainian leaders to redouble their efforts to seize additional territory now, before the window for offensive operations has closed. And Putin\u2019s renewed commitment and nuclear threats may encourage Western allies to supply advanced weapons to Ukraine.\n\nPartial mobilization, thus, is unlikely to deliver Russia any sort of real victory. But it will almost certainly prolong the war, allowing Russia to hang in the fight while grinding down Ukrainian forces. The cost of Putin's decree will be increased bloodshed and destruction over the coming weeks and months.\n\n**Jason Lyall** (@jaylyall_red5) is the James Wright Chair of Transnational Studies at Dartmouth College and author of Divided Armies: Inequality and Battlefield Performance in Modern War (Princeton University Press, 2020).",

If you consider human history, this has quite clearly been the norm for most of it.\n\nIn that world, the US would not be in NATO but rather focused on the Americas as its sphere, standing opposed to the powers of the Old World. Whatever happens in Europe, Asia, and Africa just happens--it wouldn't be our problem, even if say a Hitler rose again.

The Biden administration has been sending messages to Moscow about the grave consequences that would follow the use of a nucler weapon in Ukraine*\n\nhttps://archive.ph/sihOd\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/09/22/russia-nuclear-threat-us-options/?outputType=amp\n\n**Bold sections is my emphasis**\n\nThe United States for several months has been sending private communications to Moscow warning Russia\u2019s leadership of the grave consequences that would follow the use of a nuclear weapon, according to U.S. officials, who said the messages underscore what President Biden and his aides have articulated publicly.\n\nThe Biden administration generally has decided to keep warnings about the consequences of a nuclear strike deliberately vague, so the Kremlin worries about how Washington might respond, the officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive deliberations.\n\nThe attempt by the White House to cultivate what\u2019s known in the nuclear deterrence world as **\u201cstrategic ambiguity\u201d** comes as Russia continues to escalate its rhetoric about possible nuclear weapons use amid a domestic mobilization aimed at stanching Russian military losses in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe State Department has been involved in the private communications with Moscow, but officials would not say who delivered the messages or the scope of their content. It was not clear whether the United States had sent any new private messages in the hours since Russian President Vladimir Putin issued his latest veiled nuclear threat during a speech announcing a partial mobilization early Wednesday, but a senior U.S. official said the communication has been happening consistently over recent months.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia\u2019s Security Council, wrote Thursday in a post on Telegram that territory in eastern Ukraine would be \u201caccepted into Russia\u201d after the completion of staged \u201creferendums\u201d and vowed to strengthen the security of those areas.\n\nTo defend that annexed land, Medvedev said, Russia is able to use not only its newly mobilized forces, but also \u201cany Russian weapon, including strategic nuclear ones and those using new principles,\u201d a reference to hypersonic weapons.\n\n\u201cRussia has chosen its path,\u201d Medvedev added. \u201cThere is no way back.\u201d\n\nThe comment came a day after Putin suggested Russia would annex occupied lands in Ukraine\u2019s south and east, and incorporate the regions formally into what Moscow considers its territory. He said he was not bluffing when he vowed to use all means at Russia\u2019s disposal to defend the country\u2019s territorial integrity \u2014 a veiled reference to the country\u2019s nuclear arsenal.\n\nBiden administration officials have emphasized that this isn\u2019t the first time the Russian leadership has threatened to use nuclear weapons since the start of the war on Feb. 24, and have said there is no indication Russia is moving its nuclear weapons in preparation for an imminent strike.\n\nStill, the recent statements from the Russian leadership are more specific than previous comments and come at a time when Russia is reeling on the battlefield from a U.S.-backed Ukrainian counteroffensive.\n\nWhereas previous Kremlin statements appeared to be aimed at warning the United States and its allies against going too far in helping Ukraine, Putin\u2019s most recent comments suggested Russia is considering using a nuclear weapon on the battlefield in Ukraine to freeze gains and force Kyiv and its backers into submission, said **Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association**, a nonproliferation advocacy group in Washington.\n\n\u201cWhat everyone needs to recognize is that this is one of, if not the most, severe episodes in which nuclear weapons might be used in decades,\u201d Kimball said. \u201cThe consequences of even a so-called \u2018limited nuclear war\u2019 would be absolutely catastrophic.\u201d\n\nFor years, U.S. nuclear experts have worried that Russia might use smaller tactical nuclear weapons, sometimes referred to as \u201cbattlefield nukes,\u201d to end a conventional war favorably on its terms \u2014 a strategy sometimes described as \u201cescalate to de-escalate.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Vadym Skibitskyi, deputy head of Ukrainian military intelligence, told the U.K.\u2019s ITV News that it is possible Russia will use nuclear weapons against Ukraine \u201cto stop our offensive activity and to destroy our state.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a threat for other countries,\u201d Skibitskyi said. \u201cThe blast of a tactical nuclear weapon will have an impact not only in Ukraine but the Black Sea region.\u201d\nThe Ukrainians have tried to signal that even a Russian nuclear strike wouldn\u2019t force them into capitulation \u2014 and in fact could have the opposite effect.\n\n\u201cThreatening with nuclear weapons \u2026 to Ukrainians?\u201d Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, tweeted on Wednesday. \u201cPutin have not yet understood who he is dealing with.\u201d\nIn an interview with CBS News\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that aired Sunday, Biden was asked what he would tell Putin if the Russian leader is considering using nuclear weapons in the conflict against Ukraine.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t. Don\u2019t. Don\u2019t,\u201d Biden said. \u201cYou will change the face of war unlike anything since World War II.\u201d\nBiden declined to detail how the United States would respond, saying only that the reaction would be \u201cconsequential\u201d and would depend \u201con the extent of what they do.\u201d\n\nThe Biden administration would face a crisis if Russia were to use a small nuclear weapon in Ukraine, which isn\u2019t a U.S. treaty ally. Any direct military U.S. response against Russia would risk the possibility of a wider war between nuclear-armed superpowers \u2014 the avoidance of which the Biden administration has made its No. 1 priority in all of its Ukraine policymaking.\n\n**Matthew Kroenig, a professor of government at Georgetown University and director of the Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security at the Atlantic Council**, has argued that the best option for the administration, if faced with a limited Russian nuclear strike in Ukraine, might be to step up backing for Ukraine and conduct a limited conventional strike on the Russian forces or bases that launched the attack.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s Russian forces in Ukraine that launched the nuclear attack, the United States could strike directly against those forces,\u201d Kroenig said. \u201cIt would be calibrated to send a message that this is not a major war coming, this is a limited strike. If you are Putin, what do you do in response? I don\u2019t think you immediately say let\u2019s launch all the nukes at the United States.\u201d\n\nBut even a limited conventional strike by the U.S. military against Russia would be viewed as reckless by many in Washington, who would argue against risking a full-scale war with a nuclear-armed Russia.\n\n**James M.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p><em>U.S. has sent private warnings to Russia against using a nuclear weapon. The Biden administration has been sending messages to Moscow about the grave consequences that would follow the use of a nucler weapon in Ukraine</em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://archive.ph/sihOd\">https://archive.ph/sihOd</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/09/22/russia-nuclear-threat-us-options/?outputType=amp\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/09/22/russia-nuclear-threat-us-options/?outputType=amp</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Bold sections is my emphasis</strong></p>\n\n<p>The United States for several months has been sending private communications to Moscow warning Russia\u2019s leadership of the grave consequences that would follow the use of a nuclear weapon, according to U.S. officials, who said the messages underscore what President Biden and his aides have articulated publicly.</p>\n\n<p>The Biden administration generally has decided to keep warnings about the consequences of a nuclear strike deliberately vague, so the Kremlin worries about how Washington might respond, the officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive deliberations.</p>\n\n<p>The attempt by the White House to cultivate what\u2019s known in the nuclear deterrence world as <strong>\u201cstrategic ambiguity\u201d</strong> comes as Russia continues to escalate its rhetoric about possible nuclear weapons use amid a domestic mobilization aimed at stanching Russian military losses in eastern Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>The State Department has been involved in the private communications with Moscow, but officials would not say who delivered the messages or the scope of their content. It was not clear whether the United States had sent any new private messages in the hours since Russian President Vladimir Putin issued his latest veiled nuclear threat during a speech announcing a partial mobilization early Wednesday, but a senior U.S. official said the communication has been happening consistently over recent months.</p>\n\n<p>Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia\u2019s Security Council, wrote Thursday in a post on Telegram that territory in eastern Ukraine would be \u201caccepted into Russia\u201d after the completion of staged \u201creferendums\u201d and vowed to strengthen the security of those areas.</p>\n\n<p>To defend that annexed land, Medvedev said, Russia is able to use not only its newly mobilized forces, but also \u201cany Russian weapon, including strategic nuclear ones and those using new principles,\u201d a reference to hypersonic weapons.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cRussia has chosen its path,\u201d Medvedev added. \u201cThere is no way back.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The comment came a day after Putin suggested Russia would annex occupied lands in Ukraine\u2019s south and east, and incorporate the regions formally into what Moscow considers its territory. He said he was not bluffing when he vowed to use all means at Russia\u2019s disposal to defend the country\u2019s territorial integrity \u2014 a veiled reference to the country\u2019s nuclear arsenal.</p>\n\n<p>Biden administration officials have emphasized that this isn\u2019t the first time the Russian leadership has threatened to use nuclear weapons since the start of the war on Feb. 24, and have said there is no indication Russia is moving its nuclear weapons in preparation for an imminent strike.</p>\n\n<p>Still, the recent statements from the Russian leadership are more specific than previous comments and come at a time when Russia is reeling on the battlefield from a U.S.-backed Ukrainian counteroffensive.</p>\n\n<p>Whereas previous Kremlin statements appeared to be aimed at warning the United States and its allies against going too far in helping Ukraine, Putin\u2019s most recent comments suggested Russia is considering using a nuclear weapon on the battlefield in Ukraine to freeze gains and force Kyiv and its backers into submission, said <strong>Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association</strong>, a nonproliferation advocacy group in Washington.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat everyone needs to recognize is that this is one of, if not the most, severe episodes in which nuclear weapons might be used in decades,\u201d Kimball said. \u201cThe consequences of even a so-called \u2018limited nuclear war\u2019 would be absolutely catastrophic.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>For years, U.S. nuclear experts have worried that Russia might use smaller tactical nuclear weapons, sometimes referred to as \u201cbattlefield nukes,\u201d to end a conventional war favorably on its terms \u2014 a strategy sometimes described as \u201cescalate to de-escalate.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>On Thursday, Vadym Skibitskyi, deputy head of Ukrainian military intelligence, told the U.K.\u2019s ITV News that it is possible Russia will use nuclear weapons against Ukraine \u201cto stop our offensive activity and to destroy our state.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis is a threat for other countries,\u201d Skibitskyi said. \u201cThe blast of a tactical nuclear weapon will have an impact not only in Ukraine but the Black Sea region.\u201d\nThe Ukrainians have tried to signal that even a Russian nuclear strike wouldn\u2019t force them into capitulation \u2014 and in fact could have the opposite effect.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThreatening with nuclear weapons \u2026 to Ukrainians?\u201d Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, tweeted on Wednesday. \u201cPutin have not yet understood who he is dealing with.\u201d\nIn an interview with CBS News\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that aired Sunday, Biden was asked what he would tell Putin if the Russian leader is considering using nuclear weapons in the conflict against Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Don\u2019t. Don\u2019t,\u201d Biden said. \u201cYou will change the face of war unlike anything since World War II.\u201d\nBiden declined to detail how the United States would respond, saying only that the reaction would be \u201cconsequential\u201d and would depend \u201con the extent of what they do.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The Biden administration would face a crisis if Russia were to use a small nuclear weapon in Ukraine, which isn\u2019t a U.S. treaty ally. Any direct military U.S. response against Russia would risk the possibility of a wider war between nuclear-armed superpowers \u2014 the avoidance of which the Biden administration has made its No. 1 priority in all of its Ukraine policymaking.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Matthew Kroenig, a professor of government at Georgetown University and director of the Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security at the Atlantic Council</strong>, has argued that the best option for the administration, if faced with a limited Russian nuclear strike in Ukraine, might be to step up backing for Ukraine and conduct a limited conventional strike on the Russian forces or bases that launched the attack.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf it\u2019s Russian forces in Ukraine that launched the nuclear attack, the United States could strike directly against those forces,\u201d Kroenig said. \u201cIt would be calibrated to send a message that this is not a major war coming, this is a limited strike. If you are Putin, what do you do in response? I don\u2019t think you immediately say let\u2019s launch all the nukes at the United States.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>But even a limited conventional strike by the U.S. military against Russia would be viewed as reckless by many in Washington, who would argue against risking a full-scale war with a nuclear-armed Russia.</p>\n\n<p><strong>James M. Acton, co-director of the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace</strong>, said it doesn\u2019t make sense at this point to game out U.S. responses because there is such a wide range of possible Russian actions \u2014 from an underground nuclear test that doesn\u2019t hurt anyone to a large-scale explosion that kills tens of thousands of civilians \u2014 and there are no signs Putin is close to crossing the threshold.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf he was really thinking very seriously about using nuclear weapons very imminently, he almost certainly would want us to know that,\u201d Acton said. \u201cHe would much rather threaten nuclear use and have us make concessions than actually have to go down the path of nuclear use.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>U.S. officials have been stepping up efforts at the U.N.

Contrary to Western military orthodoxy, air superiority was not a prerequisite for battlefield success. Ukrainian forces advanced rapidly despite the absence of aerial cover and fire support from high-end fighter jets and bombers\u2014two mainstays of the American way of war.

That is the core of his chauvinism, a colonial mindset borne from contempt that Ukraine is not indeed a nation unto itself.\n\nHe also very much takes the view that Russia is really 3 nations under one Great Russia: White Russia, Little Russia, and Russia proper. Whatever differences may exist between the Russias, they are linguistic and cultural at most. No one Russia can ever be independent from the others--that is anathema historically and realistically. \n\nAnd he sees NATO as an anti-Russian alliance, that regardless what he or any ruler of Russia did, NATO would only accept the destruction of Russia and the Russian people. Unfortunately, this is really engrained in the Russian elite, after the trauma of the 90s. To hear them speak: America should've given Russia a Marshall Plan, and when they didn't, they decided a strongman like Putin would be their only saving grace. Who knows if that world would've been possible, that if we had given Russia copious aid and guidance emerging from the Soviet days, things might've worked out different--a world without Putin. But after 2008, that was foreclosed permanently with the Georgian affair.\n\nUkraine in NATO to him is therefore a combination of all three of those concerns. It violates him at a core, fundamental level, one where yes: it would be better to destroy the world than to lose \"Little\" Russia. And he's not alone in the Kremlin in thinking so. Medvedev may be a drunk, but he's not alone in wishing a great bloody struggle against NATO.\n\nIf the West never aided Ukraine, Russia would have won and his immediate insecurities would've been satisfied, and any nuclear crisis forestalled until Russia was ready to turn their ire towards another ancien Russian state. And so on, until you could look at a map of 1914 Russia and a map of modern Russia and see no difference.\n\nBut, as we've seen, it's possible to confront Putin and the world not to end. Russian nukes are something to fear, but unless if the Russian state were facing imminent collapse (like Russia in March 1918), I don't think he'd deploy nukes against Ukraine or end the world if he loses.\n\nRather, like Portugal, like France, like every colonial power ever, he will stamp his feet, bluster like a buffoon, burn the country asunder, and then retreat and clamp down. Live to fight another day rather than commit suicide. It may take him longer to get there, but as long as the West backs Ukraine, we will get there, his insecurities be damned. Unfortunately for the people of Ukraine, he must be taught a tripartite lesson, which will take time, money, and blood to sink in:\n\n1) Ukraine is not a Russian colony\n\n2) Ukraine is not Little Russia\n\n3) NATO will stand opposed to Russia so long as Russia pursues revanchist claims in former Russian territory",

Yet there was one notable omission: India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi. Not only did the two not meet, they did not appear to exchange greetings when they stood next to each other at a group photo.\n\nSome frostiness was expected given they had not met since a long-running dispute over a shared Himalayan border flared into clashes that killed 20 Indian troops and at least four Chinese ones in June 2020. On September 8th this year, however, both sides began withdrawing forces from a fifth point on the border, after pulling back from four others in the past two years. The timing raised hopes of a Xi-Modi meeting. Their mutual snub suggests the border dispute is stabilising, yet far from over.\n\nThis matters not just because it has the potential to spark a broader conflict between Asia\u2019s two biggest countries, which both have nuclear weapons and fought one brief border war in 1962 (China won). It has also prompted a historic change in India\u2019s military posture, forcing it to shift resources away from Pakistan\u2014its longtime adversary\u2014and to enhance defence ties with America and its allies, especially Japan and Australia. They too are seeking to counter China\u2019s military ambitions.\n\nManaging relations with India has thus become one of Mr Xi\u2019s biggest diplomatic challenges. He is attempting to assert China\u2019s territorial claims, while positioning it as a champion of the developing world and undermining American efforts to build a coalition of like-minded democracies, including India. As well as alienating Mr Modi, who shares some of his authoritarian instincts, Mr Xi also risks losing access to the vast and fast-growing Indian market for Chinese companies that are struggling to grow at home and in the West.\n\nThe dispute has its roots in the fuzzy frontiers sketched out when India was British-ruled. China claims the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh. India claims a swathe of Chinese-controlled territory called Aksai Chin (see map). Since 1993 they have had protocols to stop encounters on the de facto border, known as the Line of Actual Control (lac), from escalating. Those include not using guns when border patrols clash. But as each side has improved border infrastructure in recent years, encounters have become more frequent\u2014and more violent.\n\nThe latest flare-up began around May 2020, when Indian officials say China moved new troops and equipment towards the lac on the fringes of Aksai Chin. China said it was responding to new Indian infrastructure in the area. Each accused the other of breaching the lac and moved in thousands of troops and heavy weapons. Brawls erupted, culminating in the clash that killed 24 soldiers\u2014the first combat deaths on the border since 1975.\n\nThe most recent disengagement comes after a 16th round of commander-level talks in July and mirrors the earlier withdrawals. Between September 8th and 12th, both sides pulled back forces from an area that India calls Gogra-Hotsprings and China calls Jianan Daban. That effectively creates a buffer zone on either side of the lac in which neither side conducts patrols or has any structures. It also leaves two main areas where the standoff continues\u2014one near the village of Demchok and the other on the Depsang plains farther north.\n\nMore talks are expected to try to create similar buffer zones in those areas. \u201cFrom the standpoint of increasing stability and preventing crises, these buffer zones play a very important role,\u201d says Taylor Fravel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But the latest agreement covered a relatively small area, and was military, rather than political. \u201cSo I would not view it as a diplomatic breakthrough making possible a bilateral summit,\u201d he added. Critically, China still rejects Indian demands to return to the status quo prior to April 2020.\n\nMr Xi\u2019s motives are clear. Having placed new emphasis on territorial issues, he wants to show progress and stability ahead of a Communist Party congress in October that is expected to grant him a third five-year term as leader. He also wants to focus on Taiwan, mindful of recent American moves to enhance ties with the self-governed island and of Russia\u2019s troubles in Ukraine. Besides, China has upgraded its infrastructure in Tibet and stationed enough forces there to respond quickly to another crisis on the Indian border.\n\nMr Modi, too, appears anxious to avoid further clashes, given China\u2019s superior firepower. For him, though, the calculus is more complicated. He has been facing criticism within India, including from retired military commanders, for ceding territory to China. Rahul Gandhi, a prominent opposition politician, tweeted on September 14th that Mr Modi had \u201cgiven 1,000 sq kms of territory to China without a fight\u201d and asked how he planned to retrieve it. That is not a realistic option. Neither, for the moment, is reconciliation.",

After all, Putin cited more than NATO expansion in his speech justifying the \"Special Operation.\" However, I also cannot ignore the extent to which he did cite Nato Expansionism, etc, as a justification for war (I hesitate to describe his speech as a casus belli due to the Kremlin's framing of the conflict as a special military operation). As other commenters have observed, if anything Russia's actions have accelerated NATO expansionist thought.  \n\n\nBut I suppose you could intrepret this as evidence of just what you said, that there is much more than security at stake here.

        "body": "Been thinking about tanks this morning... and how Ukraine may play out in the medium term, and how this increasingly looks very bad for Russia.\n\nBasically, I started by thinking about he Russian tanks. T-62s are starting to show up now in numbers, and all the recent replacements seem to be increasingly T-62s pulled from storage. \n\nThis seems to indicate that their T-72 stocks are now dry or close to it, with any existing stored T-72's being cannabilised for parts to keep the existing fleet running, else why send T-62s ? \n\nThis seems to indicate that, by early-2023, T-62s and older model T-72As/T-72Bs will be the mainstays of the Ru tank fleet. Might even see T-55s. The modern T-72B3s, T-80s and T-90s are in Ukraine already, and are getting attrited away quickly. \n\nThis sets up an interesting possibility.... because Ukrainian \"tank reserves\" are unlikely to work the same way. \n\nRight now they have a bunch of older T-72Ms and T-64s roughly equivalent to the russian T-72A's. However, when they lose these... and assuming the west continues to want to supply Ukraine with armour, there is hardly any Soviet armour left to supply them with. We're getting to the point that EE has been drained dry of old soviet armour they can spare. Very soon, the only armour the west will have in storage will be M1A2s. If they want to replace Ukranian losses, they will have to start sending these in 2023.\n\nSo it seems to me that, around the same time as Russia is increasingly limited to older T-72s/T-62s the west will have to dip into M1A2 stocks. There will be little choice other than \"to abandon given Ukraine armour OR give them M1A2s\".\n\nIf this comes to pass..... its going to go very badly for russia.\n\nArguably you can say a T-72B3, T-80 or T-90 can head-to-head a M1A2..... but after another 6m they'll be increasingly rare as operational tanks. They're already starting to dwindle rapidly as a percentage of all losses and we've got 6 more months to go. Even those that survived destruction will have faced front-line usage for 12 months continuously and will be way outside any reasonable timeline for barrel/engine/transmission replacement. \n\nWe know from GWI and GWII that the equivalent of Iraq's T72-Ms (T-72A/Bs) get creamed by Abrams.... So T-62's are going to be utterly ineffective against them as well. They don't even have modern rounds developed for them.... the 115mm rounds they use stopped development in the 80's when Russia moved to 125mm, and would stand no chance at all of penetrating a M1A2s modern armour (whilst potentially being effective against the T-72Ms Ukraine has now).\n\nAt the same time I would also expect russian stocks of the most modern ATGMs to be low or non-existent for similar reasons. Although they likely have huge stocks of ATGM from Soviet times I am not sure modern russia had built the same kind of large ATGM reserve, and with them having to reach down to soviet stocks in the longer haul they are likely to find these ineffective against modern M1A2 too.\n\nWe could see a situation where Russia is simply unable to stop armoured thrusts by Ukraine in 2023. \n\nAlthough we've generally been pretty down on the fact the US has held the M1A2 back..... in the end doing so until Russias modern tank stocks were almost entirely degraded has the potential to deal Ukraine the ability to make critical breakthroughs in 2023. \n\nIf they'd given them M1A2s in Feb 2022 Russia was mainly T-72B3s, T-80s and T-90s they may have gone 1-for-1 of 2-for-1. \n\nIf they give them in Feb 2023 when Russia is down to mainly T-72As/Bs and T-62s the same tanks will likely go 10 or 20 or 30-for-1 against russia's much degraded ability to penetrate their armour.",

Although they likely have huge stocks of ATGM from Soviet times I am not sure modern russia had built the same kind of large ATGM reserve, and with them having to reach down to soviet stocks in the longer haul they are likely to find these ineffective against modern M1A2 too.</p>\n\n<p>We could see a situation where Russia is simply unable to stop armoured thrusts by Ukraine in 2023. </p>\n\n<p>Although we&#39;ve generally been pretty down on the fact the US has held the M1A2 back..... in the end doing so until Russias modern tank stocks were almost entirely degraded has the potential to deal Ukraine the ability to make critical breakthroughs in 2023. </p>\n\n<p>If they&#39;d given them M1A2s in Feb 2022 Russia was mainly T-72B3s, T-80s and T-90s they may have gone 1-for-1 of 2-for-1. </p>\n\n<p>If they give them in Feb 2023 when Russia is down to mainly T-72As/Bs and T-62s the same tanks will likely go 10 or 20 or 30-for-1 against russia&#39;s much degraded ability to penetrate their armour.</p>\n</div>",

We are now 200+ days into what was originally planned to be a quick decapitation attack. Finland and Sweden are joining NATO, Nord Stream 2 has been canceled, yachts and various assets are seized, there has been a significant loss of man and material, etc. Most importantly Russia has taken a huge hit to their prestige with the battlefield failures which will have a long term impact on Putin\u2019s influence around the world. \r  \n\r  \nHe could certainly double-down and escalate the conflict further. But realistically, given the growing strength of Ukrainian forces he doesn\u2019t have a great path forward to do that. \r  \n\r  \nPutin needs to find a way out of this mess which shows as much strength as possible to both his internal and external constituencies. Basically de-escalating but in a way that shows both great strength and aggressiveness to the world and to the Russian people. \r  \n\r  \nSo how does he de-escalate with strength?\r Well two levers he has nukes and mobilization.\r  \n\r  \nThreatening to use nukes has the capacity to create fear around the world and provide a degree of comfort to the Russian that despite any setbacks their army may encounter, he has a back up plan. The threat of nukes instills fear and importantly changes the conversation away from the numerous failures they have encountered on the battlefield. As an example,  getting those pesky mil bloggers to stop talking about the humiliating failure in Kharkiv and start talking about the potential impact of using tactical nukes. \r  \n\r  \nPartial mobilization is also quite powerful as it creates an uncomfortable situation with the Russian people who in general appear to have very little desire to die on the battlefield without necessarily triggering a revolution that mass mobilization would potentially do. While it seems very unlikely these 300K new recruits will enable him to take the offense (logistics, training, etc) he\u2019ll be able to have a more credible defense preventing further humiliations.  Most importantly, if he has an intention to negotiate (a likely unfavorable) peace deal, he can position himself as a leader who was forced to mobilize by the aggressive West, but through his heroic efforts managed to denazify Ukraine and come to peaceful terms overall making the world a better place. He can then stand down mobilization efforts, thus resolving an issue which he created. Great job Putin.\r  \n\r  \nSo at this point, I believe this can go either way \u2013 Russia could truly be on the path to escalate the conflict further even to the point of using nuclear weapons or instead they are going in the 180 degree opposite direction to de-escalate. \n\nWe need to not only consider Putin\u2019s words but also his actions too over the coming months to see which way this goes.",

Given how strongly Russians think of Crimea as theirs, this does not seem unlikely to me. By contrast, if Russia experiences an extended period of breakdown of government and the chain of command, complete with insurgency and civil war, Ukraine might be able to swoop in to Crimea relatively unopposed and be left in control of it at the end of the war. Full mobilisation significantly increases the likelihood of governmental collapse for Russia, so makes Ukrainian occupation of Crimea more likely (though still probably unlikely in absolute terms).",

Additionally, because of widespread internal displacement since the beginning of the conflict, voting databases are likely out of date. In Kherson, for example, Ukrainian officials have said that about half the pre-war population have left.\n\n>The plans have been condemned by both the government of Ukraine and its allies in the West as \"illegitimate\" and \"a sham.\" The European Union has said it won't recognize the results and has indicated it is preparing a new package of sanctions against Russia. \n\n>In Donetsk, the question will only be presented in Russian. The chair of the People's Council \u2014 an unelected body \u2014 in the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic, Vladimir Bidyovka, called Russian is the \"state language.\"\n\n>The questions on the ballot vary slightly depending on the region. \n\n>>In the Donetsk People's Republic, the question will be: \"Are you in favor of joining of the DPR to the Russian Federation on the rights of a subject of the Russian Federation?\" The self-declared Luhansk People's Republic uses the same phrasing.\n\n>>In Kherson, the question will be: \u201cAre you in favor of the secession of the Kherson region from state of Ukraine, the formation of an independent state by the Kherson region and its joining the Russian Federation as a subject of the Russian Federation?\u201d In occupied Kherson, Marina Zakharova \u2014 who chairs the election commission \u2014 said about 750,000 are expected to vote.\n\n>>And in occupied parts of Zaporizhzhia, the question is in both Russian and Ukrainian, and it reads: \"Do you vote FOR the secession of Zaporizhzhia Oblast from Ukraine, the formation of Zaporizhzhia Oblast as an independent state and its accession to the Russian Federation as a sub-entity of the Russian Federation?\"\n\n>The Central Election Commission of Russia said it will take part in monitoring the referendums in all four areas.\n\n>In both Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia regions, local authorities have urged people to vote from home, saying that ballot boxes can be brought to them. A video from the Luhansk election commission says, \"You can vote directly from home! From 23 to 27 September you can vote at home.\"\n\n>Ahead of the votes, pro-Russian authorities are trying to enthuse voters. Russian state news agency RIA Novosti showed a poster being distributed in Luhansk, which read \"Russia is the future.\" \n\n>\"We are united by a 1,000-year history,\" it says. \"For centuries, we were part of the same great country. The break-up of the state was a huge political disaster. ... It's time to restore historical justice.\"",

In Kherson, for example, Ukrainian officials have said that about half the pre-war population have left.</p>\n\n<p>The plans have been condemned by both the government of Ukraine and its allies in the West as &quot;illegitimate&quot; and &quot;a sham.&quot; The European Union has said it won&#39;t recognize the results and has indicated it is preparing a new package of sanctions against Russia. </p>\n\n<p>In Donetsk, the question will only be presented in Russian. The chair of the People&#39;s Council \u2014 an unelected body \u2014 in the self-declared Donetsk People&#39;s Republic, Vladimir Bidyovka, called Russian is the &quot;state language.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The questions on the ballot vary slightly depending on the region. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the Donetsk People&#39;s Republic, the question will be: &quot;Are you in favor of joining of the DPR to the Russian Federation on the rights of a subject of the Russian Federation?&quot; The self-declared Luhansk People&#39;s Republic uses the same phrasing.</p>\n\n<p>In Kherson, the question will be: \u201cAre you in favor of the secession of the Kherson region from state of Ukraine, the formation of an independent state by the Kherson region and its joining the Russian Federation as a subject of the Russian Federation?\u201d In occupied Kherson, Marina Zakharova \u2014 who chairs the election commission \u2014 said about 750,000 are expected to vote.</p>\n\n<p>And in occupied parts of Zaporizhzhia, the question is in both Russian and Ukrainian, and it reads: &quot;Do you vote FOR the secession of Zaporizhzhia Oblast from Ukraine, the formation of Zaporizhzhia Oblast as an independent state and its accession to the Russian Federation as a sub-entity of the Russian Federation?&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Central Election Commission of Russia said it will take part in monitoring the referendums in all four areas.</p>\n\n<p>In both Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia regions, local authorities have urged people to vote from home, saying that ballot boxes can be brought to them. A video from the Luhansk election commission says, &quot;You can vote directly from home! From 23 to 27 September you can vote at home.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Ahead of the votes, pro-Russian authorities are trying to enthuse voters. Russian state news agency RIA Novosti showed a poster being distributed in Luhansk, which read &quot;Russia is the future.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>&quot;We are united by a 1,000-year history,&quot; it says. &quot;For centuries, we were part of the same great country. The break-up of the state was a huge political disaster. ... It&#39;s time to restore historical justice.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

That brings their total tanks to around 6,400.\n\nIf Russia has already lost somewhere between 17% and 31% of their tanks, after only half a year of this... well, they aren't going to last in the long term. Meanwhile, Ukraine has literally captured more equipment from the Russians than they've lost, *and* NATO is constantly giving them new shit.\n\nIn other words, Russia loses this war eventually. The only question is what they plan on doing about it, and when. Will they give up once they've lost too much gear to continue? Will they resort to human wave attacks, just throwing a million conscripts at the problem? Will they throw a tantrum and toss a nuke out? Those are the unanswered questions.

They could up their risk tolerance in operations behind enemy lines to do more of what we saw in Crimea with that spate of attacks, most famously the Saki attack, assuming that was operators on the ground and not missiles. If it was missiles, they could decide to expend a larger portion of that valuable resource to achieve the same - more illusion of security shattering strikes. But these are all pretty much just intensifications of existing strategies and not a new card being drawn. For that, Ukraine is dependent on the west - provision of western tanks, longer range missiles or more aircraft transfers (not F16 - though the best time to start covert training of pilots was yesterday and the next best is today) are probably the most likely options. Less visible would be increased intel sharing - if there\u2019s still some things NATO keeps close to the chest, they could start to bring Ukraine in on that info, or become more granular and timely with intel to further enhance decisions at the tactical level.\n\nEssentially Ukraine itself can mostly just intensify what it\u2019s already doing if it thinks results won\u2019t be too costly.

If it was missiles, they could decide to expend a larger portion of that valuable resource to achieve the same - more illusion of security shattering strikes. But these are all pretty much just intensifications of existing strategies and not a new card being drawn. For that, Ukraine is dependent on the west - provision of western tanks, longer range missiles or more aircraft transfers (not F16 - though the best time to start covert training of pilots was yesterday and the next best is today) are probably the most likely options. Less visible would be increased intel sharing - if there\u2019s still some things NATO keeps close to the chest, they could start to bring Ukraine in on that info, or become more granular and timely with intel to further enhance decisions at the tactical level.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially Ukraine itself can mostly just intensify what it\u2019s already doing if it thinks results won\u2019t be too costly. It\u2019s very much up western suppliers to play new cards.</p>\n</div>",

Once things turned around for the Soviets they were fully intent on striking back at the Germans, civilians included. While the Americans were also depicted rather negatively in German propaganda, you didn't see the same kind of extermination rhetoric that was the bread and butter for anti-Soviet propaganda, Germans on the Western front generally treated allied soldiers much better than they did Soviets on the eastern front and the Americans responded in kind. \n\nThe US in general is a very sheltered nation so they're often more measured and humane in the way they conduct themselves, the last time the domestic population had to suffer through a war that carries with it real consequences was the Civil War and that was well, a civil war, not a foreign invasion.

While the Americans were also depicted rather negatively in German propaganda, you didn&#39;t see the same kind of extermination rhetoric that was the bread and butter for anti-Soviet propaganda, Germans on the Western front generally treated allied soldiers much better than they did Soviets on the eastern front and the Americans responded in kind. </p>\n\n<p>The US in general is a very sheltered nation so they&#39;re often more measured and humane in the way they conduct themselves, the last time the domestic population had to suffer through a war that carries with it real consequences was the Civil War and that was well, a civil war, not a foreign invasion.

People talk about Vladimir Putin dragging Russia into a North Korean future on behalf of his ego need to understand that Putin doesn't hold that kind of sway in Russia. He's no Soviet leader, he's much more akin to the Tsars of Russia. \n\nHow does that work? Think of shogun Japan too if you will, or 15th century England. The basic premise is that oligarchs are the dukes and nobility of the realm, and within their zones of competency they are effectively in control. These zones of competencies effectively add up to be the entire Russian state. Putin's job foremost is to manage, and coordinate those oligarchs, and prevent disputes between them. While he is more powerful than any individual oligarch, he very much rules on their behalf. That is to say, if the majority of oligarchs, who are the majority of power in Russia, want Putin gone, they will get him gone. Putin's entire career domestically has been a diplomatic game with oligarchs. \n\nWhile it's true he's definitely gained a leg up compared to where he was in 2001, the truth is when people say \"he will drag Russia into a North Korean future\", they don't realize that Putin is no Kim. He's no Stalin. He's not even a Xi Jinping. \n\nRussia is not a totalitarian state, it's an oligarchic state. The difference being that in the former the state controls society and in the latter the society through the nobility called oligarchs controls the state. \n\nIn short, barring some VERY big political purges that could possibly lead to civil war (as you saw with the Baron's war, or the Shogun wars), Putin can't just dictate the future of Russia purely according to his own ego. \n\nYou see this already all the time by the fact that he's been having to dance with his domestic opinion, and the mysterious deaths of some oligarchs suggest that there are already tensions brewing.\n\n\nEdit: the prisoner exchange for one of the oligarchs is also pretty interesting because it's a public thing that shows how much pressure oligarchies can exert on putin to do something that  is very clearly hated in the public view.",

The difference being that in the former the state controls society and in the latter the society through the nobility called oligarchs controls the state. </p>\n\n<p>In short, barring some VERY big political purges that could possibly lead to civil war (as you saw with the Baron&#39;s war, or the Shogun wars), Putin can&#39;t just dictate the future of Russia purely according to his own ego. </p>\n\n<p>You see this already all the time by the fact that he&#39;s been having to dance with his domestic opinion, and the mysterious deaths of some oligarchs suggest that there are already tensions brewing.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: the prisoner exchange for one of the oligarchs is also pretty interesting because it&#39;s a public thing that shows how much pressure oligarchies can exert on putin to do something that  is very clearly hated in the public view.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "[**Russia ups the ante in Ukraine**](https://canadiandimension.com/articles/view/russia-ups-the-ante-in-ukraine)\n\n\u201cWar,\u201d said the great Prussian strategist Carl von Clausewitz, \u201cis an act of force, and there is no logical limit to the application of that force. Each side, therefore, compels its opponent to follow suit; a reciprocal action is started which must lead, in theory, to extremes.\u201d\n\n\\- When Russia began hostilities in February, it seems to have envisioned a short war ending in a negotiated settlement.\n\n\\- Western powers initiated the process of escalation, sending large volumes of military aid to Ukraine. This aid has proven very effective, enabling the Ukrainians first to halt the Russian advance and then to push the Russians back.\n\n\\- the natural response to setbacks in war is not to give in but to apply more force of one\u2019s own. And thus we should not be surprised that the Russian reaction to its recent defeat has not been to surrender but to escalate even further.\n\n\\- the escalation has taken shape in two important ways.\n\n1. Perhaps as early as October 1 the four provinces will be absorbed into the Russian Federation.\n2. A partial mobilization, calling up 300,000 military reservists. To date, Russia has only sent around 200,000 troops to the war in Ukraine. While some experts doubt Russia\u2019s logistical ability to effectively deploy another 300,000, the more than doubling of the army\u2019s size in Ukraine cannot but make a difference.\n\n\\- the likely absorption of Ukrainian territory into the Russian Federation severely complicates any potential peace negotiations... The earlier outlines of a peace deal were something along the lines of Ukraine agreeing not to join NATO and accepting the loss of Crimea and Donbas, and in return getting back its other lost territories. **That deal is now firmly off the table.**\n\n\\- Once the four Ukrainian provinces become part of the Russian Federation, the Russian government will be constitutionally forbidden from giving them back to Ukraine as part of a peace deal. Moreover, it will also be unconstitutional for anybody in Russia even to suggest such a deal.\n\n\\- Russia is now committed to defending its newly conquered territory to the bitter end. If the additional resources announced this week don\u2019t do the trick, then one can expect further escalations down the line.\n\n\\- In the meantime, Western leaders seem to be banking on Ukraine\u2019s ability to achieve a total military victory. This week\u2019s developments make this considerably less likely than before.\n\n\\- All that, however, remains to be determined. As Clausewitz noted, war is a realm of chance and uncertainty. It would be a rash analyst who dared to predict how this current war will turn out. About the only thing of which one can be confident is that **the war will continue for a long time yet**\u2014certainly many months, and perhaps even years, until the two sides reach a point of mutual exhaustion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Paul Robinson is a professor in the Graduate School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Ottawa and a Senior Fellow at the Institute for Peace and Diplomacy.

Each side, therefore, compels its opponent to follow suit; a reciprocal action is started which must lead, in theory, to extremes.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>- When Russia began hostilities in February, it seems to have envisioned a short war ending in a negotiated settlement.</p>\n\n<p>- Western powers initiated the process of escalation, sending large volumes of military aid to Ukraine. This aid has proven very effective, enabling the Ukrainians first to halt the Russian advance and then to push the Russians back.</p>\n\n<p>- the natural response to setbacks in war is not to give in but to apply more force of one\u2019s own. And thus we should not be surprised that the Russian reaction to its recent defeat has not been to surrender but to escalate even further.</p>\n\n<p>- the escalation has taken shape in two important ways.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Perhaps as early as October 1 the four provinces will be absorbed into the Russian Federation.</li>\n<li>A partial mobilization, calling up 300,000 military reservists. To date, Russia has only sent around 200,000 troops to the war in Ukraine. While some experts doubt Russia\u2019s logistical ability to effectively deploy another 300,000, the more than doubling of the army\u2019s size in Ukraine cannot but make a difference.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>- the likely absorption of Ukrainian territory into the Russian Federation severely complicates any potential peace negotiations... The earlier outlines of a peace deal were something along the lines of Ukraine agreeing not to join NATO and accepting the loss of Crimea and Donbas, and in return getting back its other lost territories. <strong>That deal is now firmly off the table.</strong></p>\n\n<p>- Once the four Ukrainian provinces become part of the Russian Federation, the Russian government will be constitutionally forbidden from giving them back to Ukraine as part of a peace deal. Moreover, it will also be unconstitutional for anybody in Russia even to suggest such a deal.</p>\n\n<p>- Russia is now committed to defending its newly conquered territory to the bitter end. If the additional resources announced this week don\u2019t do the trick, then one can expect further escalations down the line.</p>\n\n<p>- In the meantime, Western leaders seem to be banking on Ukraine\u2019s ability to achieve a total military victory. This week\u2019s developments make this considerably less likely than before.</p>\n\n<p>- All that, however, remains to be determined. As Clausewitz noted, war is a realm of chance and uncertainty. It would be a rash analyst who dared to predict how this current war will turn out. About the only thing of which one can be confident is that <strong>the war will continue for a long time yet</strong>\u2014certainly many months, and perhaps even years, until the two sides reach a point of mutual exhaustion.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><em>Paul Robinson is a professor in the Graduate School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Ottawa and a Senior Fellow at the Institute for Peace and Diplomacy.

The West wants to bog Russia down and have them eventually rageQuit.\n\nIf you gave Ukraine 1k M1A2s SEP, and 300 F35s, Ukraine would be on the way to Moscow right now. The West does not want that. They want a weak Russia. Not a cornered one. Also, a very military successful Ukraine means they kinda gain some independence from the West too.\n\nIt's an act of balance. We will help you defend yourself as long as you do what we say. A too successful Ukraine might give them some extra ideas NATO does not want them to have.\n\n\nEdit : don't be so naive lol",
