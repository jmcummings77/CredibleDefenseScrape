      "selftext": "The r/CredibleDefense daily megathread is for asking questions and posting submissions that would not fit the criteria of our post submissions. As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster. Don't abuse it though! If something is not obviously against the rules but you still feel that it should be reviewed, leave a short but descriptive comment while filing the report.",

Hamas needs 5 days of ceasefire to organize its forces.

Hamas needs 5 days of ceasefire to organize its forces. Several of his battalions in the north of the Gaza Strip were disbanded as a result of the IDF attacks and he wants to unite the ranks, stock up on fuel, water and food.  </p>\n\n<p>Yahya Sinwar knows that almost every terrorist who dares to emerge from the tunnels is in danger of being killed by the IDF.

But Israel has continued to hit such sites.\n\n>The information included GPS coordinates of a number of medical facilities and information on movements of aid groups in Gaza to the Israeli government for at least a month, according to three people familiar with the communications. All were granted anonymity because they feared speaking publicly would make it more difficult for aid groups to operate in Gaza.\n\n>Still, Israel has launched operations against Hamas in or near aid sites, including hospitals, leading to the destruction of buildings and the blocking of fuel and other critical supplies.\n\n>It\u2019s unclear if the U.S. has compiled a formal \u201cno-strike\u201d list or if it is providing one-off guidance.

They just expect them to learn on the job, which means learning by making mistakes and hoping they figure it out afterwards, which is a VERY costly way of learning \n\n2) They recalled a lot of offices who served in the old days where the UAF was an absolute joke.

I don\u2019t exactly follow how it justifies you conclusion that maximalist goals are bad and Ukraine should just lay down and give Russians what they want. What you\u2019re talking about is just a tiny part of the equation. Here are some more parts: \n\nThere will never be a better opportunity for Ukraine, Russia will never be as weak and as isolated as they are now. Ukrainian army will likely never be so large as it is now, there will never be so much international support (you could argue it\u2019s not enough but it sure will be less if Ukraine attacks and tries to reclaim territory after some ceasefire and in peace)  as there is during an unjustified genocidal Russian invasion. So imo just pushing on and being stubborn is a solid strategy for Ukraine. Russia is getting weaker. Political chaos in Russia is entirely possible and will probably be much less likely if it has time to recover. The fight is still on, you can\u2019t say it\u2019s not worth it until you know the outcome. This conclusion depends on expectations and we have different expectations including let\u2019s say inability of Putin to re-elect himself in march and maintain order. Plus western politicians would look bad if they just stop supporting us, so by being stubborn we manipulate them too to help our cause. I fully support Ukrainian maximalist goals despite not having competent officer corps and I\u2019m a super rational analytical thinking human being with a lot of skin in the game too. My closest friend just came back from the coke plant. Plus forcing total Russian defeat is actually the only chance imo to stop Russia from being a bloodthirsty expansionist empire and ensure safety of generations of Ukrainians. Having proficient officers or not is like 10% of the big picture or less. For us the fight is worth it and we fight how we can and with what we have. And whining about what Ukraine does wrong or how it should be negotiating peace is not just opinions. It\u2019s damaging to the great cause of a great fight by an American ally, and it\u2019s one thing to hear that from some jornalist, but hearing that from US officers assuming they care about US security interests is kinda worse.",

So imo just pushing on and being stubborn is a solid strategy for Ukraine. Russia is getting weaker. Political chaos in Russia is entirely possible and will probably be much less likely if it has time to recover. The fight is still on, you can\u2019t say it\u2019s not worth it until you know the outcome. This conclusion depends on expectations and we have different expectations including let\u2019s say inability of Putin to re-elect himself in march and maintain order. Plus western politicians would look bad if they just stop supporting us, so by being stubborn we manipulate them too to help our cause. I fully support Ukrainian maximalist goals despite not having competent officer corps and I\u2019m a super rational analytical thinking human being with a lot of skin in the game too. My closest friend just came back from the coke plant. Plus forcing total Russian defeat is actually the only chance imo to stop Russia from being a bloodthirsty expansionist empire and ensure safety of generations of Ukrainians. Having proficient officers or not is like 10% of the big picture or less. For us the fight is worth it and we fight how we can and with what we have. And whining about what Ukraine does wrong or how it should be negotiating peace is not just opinions. It\u2019s damaging to the great cause of a great fight by an American ally, and it\u2019s one thing to hear that from some jornalist, but hearing that from US officers assuming they care about US security interests is kinda worse.</p>\n</div>",

'The West' is in a completely different ballpark altogether - OK, maybe not in drones necessarily.\n\nUkraine had Thermal FPV drones for a while now - [Angry Drones of Ukraine Armed Forces. What types of kamikaze drones are most publicly mentioned: statistics and examples](https://molfar.com/en/blog/angry-drones-yaki-droni-kamikadze-zsu-naychastishe-zgaduyutsya-v-media-statistika-i-prikladi) (Ukrainian source, but just as an overview) - at least since February.\n\nRussia has received them only recently - https://ass_with_a_t.com/defense/1685803:\n\n> MOSCOW, October 6. /TASS/. The Russian Gortenzia FPV (First Person View) kamikaze drone has received a thermal imager for night combat missions in the zone of the special military operation in Ukraine, the drone\u2019s developer told TASS on Friday.\n\n> \"Over 2,500 Gortenzia UAVs have been supplied to the zone of the special military operation since 2022. This is a very large amount of deliveries. Russian service members sometimes send video materials with missions accomplished. Over this month alone, they have sent us 20 records of sorties.

            "body": "I have a lot of issues with the first half of this article. \n\nFirst, there are actually multiple conversations happening in the article and the authors aren't even aware. \n\nFor example, the British Army interviewed were discussing their basic training package, the only training they do, which is five weeks of individual training for junior enlisted soldiers, focusing almost entirely on dismounted infantry tasks. News flash, everyone is teaching the privates how to storm trenches and shit in their basic training packages.\n\nMeanwhile, nearly everything described in the article about the US Army isn't describing its basic training package, its describing its \"advanced\" combined arms training course (also five weeks), which was meant to be attended by formed maneuver brigades to ready them specifically for the UAF strategic counteroffensive. \n\nRemember folks, that's the same counteroffensive that the UAF chain of command expected to reach the coast in weeks, who were supposedly telling their company commanders that the sight of Bradleys and Leopards would cause the Russians to rout in terror. Where expectation for the offensive can be summed up by three words: mobility, mobility, mobility. Where they literally thought by the end of summer they were going to be at the Isthmus of Perekop to threaten Crimea, or already in Crimea. \n\nThe authors wrote this article with hindsight, because they are bitching that the US Army didn't put enough emphasis on positional warfare. Neither the UAF General Staff or the  command and staff of the Tavria Operational Strategic Grouping of Forces, who did an absolutely horrific job planning this offensive.\n\nThe authors outright blame the fate of the shitshow 47th Brigade on the US Army's poor training. I guess the authors didn't follow the 5 months of social media drama that came out revealing the many many many issues with that unit, and insread decided failed attack=US fucked up the training. \n\nI'll even admit the US Army training probably wasn't very good. Why would it be though? There is no history of ever doing anything of this sort. \n\nThe US Army has standardized basic training for everyone, then they go to their units and receive more individual and then collective (unit) training. Then, having completed an entire training cycle, about half a year or more, THEN they go to a Combat Training Center (CTC) for roughly 4-5 weeks for more training before a week or so long field training exercise that validate/certify them as combat ready or not. \n\nThe UAF training was ass backwards from that. The UAF created a bunch of soldiers from who knows where, with zero standardization for basic training for any job, put them into a unit, and sent them to Germany for combined arms training. The UAF brigades showing up were as green as can be. They needed to borrow all their equipment, which only worked out kinda for the 47th who actually would fight Bradleys. They weren't allowed to use their own drones due to German laws and other issues.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I have a lot of issues with the first half of this article. </p>\n\n<p>First, there are actually multiple conversations happening in the article and the authors aren&#39;t even aware. </p>\n\n<p>For example, the British Army interviewed were discussing their basic training package, the only training they do, which is five weeks of individual training for junior enlisted soldiers, focusing almost entirely on dismounted infantry tasks. News flash, everyone is teaching the privates how to storm trenches and shit in their basic training packages.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, nearly everything described in the article about the US Army isn&#39;t describing its basic training package, its describing its &quot;advanced&quot; combined arms training course (also five weeks), which was meant to be attended by formed maneuver brigades to ready them specifically for the UAF strategic counteroffensive. </p>\n\n<p>Remember folks, that&#39;s the same counteroffensive that the UAF chain of command expected to reach the coast in weeks, who were supposedly telling their company commanders that the sight of Bradleys and Leopards would cause the Russians to rout in terror. Where expectation for the offensive can be summed up by three words: mobility, mobility, mobility. Where they literally thought by the end of summer they were going to be at the Isthmus of Perekop to threaten Crimea, or already in Crimea. </p>\n\n<p>The authors wrote this article with hindsight, because they are bitching that the US Army didn&#39;t put enough emphasis on positional warfare. Neither the UAF General Staff or the  command and staff of the Tavria Operational Strategic Grouping of Forces, who did an absolutely horrific job planning this offensive.</p>\n\n<p>The authors outright blame the fate of the shitshow 47th Brigade on the US Army&#39;s poor training. I guess the authors didn&#39;t follow the 5 months of social media drama that came out revealing the many many many issues with that unit, and insread decided failed attack=US fucked up the training. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll even admit the US Army training probably wasn&#39;t very good. Why would it be though? There is no history of ever doing anything of this sort. </p>\n\n<p>The US Army has standardized basic training for everyone, then they go to their units and receive more individual and then collective (unit) training. Then, having completed an entire training cycle, about half a year or more, THEN they go to a Combat Training Center (CTC) for roughly 4-5 weeks for more training before a week or so long field training exercise that validate/certify them as combat ready or not. </p>\n\n<p>The UAF training was ass backwards from that. The UAF created a bunch of soldiers from who knows where, with zero standardization for basic training for any job, put them into a unit, and sent them to Germany for combined arms training. The UAF brigades showing up were as green as can be. They needed to borrow all their equipment, which only worked out kinda for the 47th who actually would fight Bradleys. They weren&#39;t allowed to use their own drones due to German laws and other issues. The US Army was forced to use a curriculum only following a super dumbed version of US Army mechanized doctrine because they were handed an impossible task, they can&#39;t teach that shit in five weeks. ESPECIALLY due to the major language barriers. </p>\n\n<p>And that sort of training isn&#39;t supposed to be the only training. Its bread and butter mechanized combined arms basics.

But the question is worded weird. Get away how? How could they possibly be stopped? Someone entering the war on Hamas side? The UN puting blue helmets on the ground between the IDF and Palestinians?\n\n>How many people can they bomb before international pressure mounts?\n\nIt's not a linear scale. International pressure exploded when the Hamas fake news about the IDF bombing Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital took off in the first two days after the explosion of the failed rocket in the parking lot. International pressure is mounting but it could take months or a week.\n\n>For people against a ceasefire, what is the objective of this war?\nif it is ending Hamas, do you think that is possible?\n\nThe objective is a show of stregth from Netanyahu and their coalition after they dropped the ball bad.

You must consider that Israel did not want this war, but they're virtually obligated to fight it. The realist perspective is that there is no country on this planet that could've experienced something as brutal as the October 7th attacks and \"let it go\" - much less Israel who was founded as a Jewish safe haven following the holocaust with the perpetrators (Hamas) being a fundamentalist terrorist group who simultaneously deny the holocaust all while wishing for the eradication of all Jews - and killing actual holocaust survivors. \n\n\n\nIsrael is not in Gaza to kill Gazans, they're there to dismantle Hamas' presence. Unfortunately removing terrorists from a dense urban landscape involves the death of innocents but the fact is Israel continues to maintain humanitarian corridors which have allowed over 85% of Gazans to avoid the IDF's path.

You must consider that Israel did not want this war, but they&#39;re virtually obligated to fight it. The realist perspective is that there is no country on this planet that could&#39;ve experienced something as brutal as the October 7th attacks and &quot;let it go&quot; - much less Israel who was founded as a Jewish safe haven following the holocaust with the perpetrators (Hamas) being a fundamentalist terrorist group who simultaneously deny the holocaust all while wishing for the eradication of all Jews - and killing actual holocaust survivors. </p>\n\n<p>Israel is not in Gaza to kill Gazans, they&#39;re there to dismantle Hamas&#39; presence. Unfortunately removing terrorists from a dense urban landscape involves the death of innocents but the fact is Israel continues to maintain humanitarian corridors which have allowed over 85% of Gazans to avoid the IDF&#39;s path. There is no ceasefire on the horizon, Hamas used the last one to stage October 7th.</p>\n</div>",

Japan's fanatical regime was off killing tens of millions of Chinese civilians and *eating* downed American pilots. Best way to stop that was to stop Japan. Best way to stop Japan involved destroying their factories. Factories are located in urban centers. In the 1940s, there were not effective ways to precisely target factories without killing the civilians living near them. It's not important to me whether those cities were destroyed with conventional bombs, incendiary bombs, or atomic bombs: the people living there were dead just the same.\n\n*There is no such thing as a clean war.*\n\nTo fight a war with another country implies and necessitates that a lot of civilians - old men, newborn children, pregnant women - *will* die. That's why war is a horrible thing. There's no version of war that isn't a horrible thing.\n\nWhen we invaded Normandy during our Great Crusade against the Nazis, we bombed perhaps a quarter-million French civilians - our allies - in the process. Had to do it, couldn't invade otherwise. Charles De Gaulle knew that, and gave us explicit permission to do it. **Do you believe that America killing a quarter-million French civilians was morally right?**\n\nIt's a grey area. We had to win, and we had to do that to win, and the French themselves recognized that as a necessary component of their liberation.\n\n**There is no -** ***no*** **- weapon or technology or TTP that allows you to fight a war in a built-up urban area without many,** ***many*** **civilian casualties.** It can't be done with the best of wishes. When the polity based in an urban area filled with mostly-young, mostly-civilians breaks a ceasefire to start a war, that's a part of their calculation. That's what you've signed up for. It sucks. But trying to pin down a \"no, it's morally wrong\" answer does nothing.\n\nIt was morally wrong for Napoleon's army to loot their way up into Russia and back again, de-housing and starving tens or hundreds of thousands. It was morally wrong for his army to massacre the population in Evora, Spain. It was morally wrong for the Commanche to rape settler women and steal their babies. it was morally wrong for the South Koreans to call in naval gunfire on their own fleeing refugees. It was morally wrong for the Viet Cong to torture and massacre civilians in Hue City. It was morally wrong for Sherman to burn and loot his way through civilian grainfields on his way to the coast. It was morally wrong for Mao to sit back and watch the RoC fight Japan, weakening his future enemy in the civil war. It's morally wrong for Hamas to launch rockets from hospitals, or infiltrate fighters into refugee columns, or rip up water pipes to turn them into rockets. It's morally wrong for Israel to blast that hospital launching rockets at them into rubble. It was morally wrong for America to reduce Baghdad, one of the great cities of the world, to rubble. It was morally wrong for the Mongols to do it too, many centuries ago.\n\nNo, it's **not** morally right! It's not unique, either! That's what war looks like!

Because they are so destructive, they are supposed to stop war from actually breaking out, due to people being afraid that they will be used, they are not supposed to actually being used... That's the theory anyway, but while it is obviously paradoxical, it has probably stopped a lot of wars from happening (it is for instance highly unusual in a larger historical perspective that there hasn't been any direct great power wars since ww2), so nuclear weapons do seem to work...",
