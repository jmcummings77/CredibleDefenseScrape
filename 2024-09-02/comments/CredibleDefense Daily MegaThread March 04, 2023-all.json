The relevant section is 4-1, or page 46 in the PDF. I think the current US Army ATPs don't address trenching because it is a technical engineering task for the most part, because the US rarely if ever builds substantial defensive fortifications by hand. Either a unit is forced to dig hasty fighting positions (i.e., small foxholes) under time pressure due to enemy action or they have specialized engineering teams equipped with trench digging machines to prepare longer-term defensive positions.\n\nIn any case, the old field manual states that a typical one-person initial fighting position (45cm wide on the front/back parapets x 60cm across x 90cm deep) can be dug out in around two hours in typical soil conditions with standard hand entrenching tools. So that amounts to about 121,500 cm^3 per hour per soldier. That figure varies wildly depending on soil conditions, weather, equipment availability, and enemy action.  \n\nIf the soil is unstable, it will take longer because they will need to revet the walls of the trench to stabilize it. If the soil is too rocky or compacted, pickaxes or other tools to break up the harder clumps of soil will likely be required but may not be available. If it is raining, the soil will be wet and thus heavier from the water, increasing fatigue while digging and decreasing the stability of the soil. If the ground is frozen, the ground may need to be broken up before the soldiers can even start to dig. People also tend to dig slower when subject to even intermittent enemy fires because they spend more time fighting or grabbing whatever cover may be available. \n\nI'd also guess (but don't know) that the rate will be lower as they proceed from IFPs and crawl trenches to full standard trenches (i.e., ones that are 1.7m deep), simply because they will need to lift the dirt farther to get it out of the trench and the amount of revetting required will increase the larger and deeper the trench system.\n\nedit: accidentally a word",

He lives in Kramatorsk and drives to Bakhmut sometimes (less recently nowadays as permits are needed as many volunteers got killed, but for example just drove there to deliver NV drone to Azov).\n\nBakhmut is constantly shelled with everything randomly and also on call. Russians have good drones, since 2 months ago they got NV ones which are a problem. That said the shelling is ineffective in Bakmut itself mostly as there are prepared shelters in city ruins (city is compleyely ruined now). The temaining civilians (6k) also mostly live in basements and get killed when they leave.\n\nThere is huge artillery advantage for Russians (few times?), which Ukrainians cannot match because of lack of ammo. Oh, and in Bakhmut thete are variety of units, from border guards to top ones like Azov or 93rd mech.\n\nBtw, about artillery, he says this too but its my opinion too: its numbers game. Sure, m777 and spgs and mlrs do make difference but no couple of hundreds is not enough when russians have couple of thousands. In any case the situation is pretty much critical (also in wider sense he is a pesimist, Ukraine is going to lose war of attrition like this).\n\nHe actually adressed the issue of counterattack he reported on, shortly: yes, elements of 4 brigades but it was company of each so battalion sized and after initial success Russian threw lots of manpower and it. Record daily losses but it worked. And in general many people got misled initially (i agree with that, mostly because Ukraine does counterattacks locally that are often not reported).\n\nHe says there are some reserves vaguely but he stayes to change the Bakhmut situation a big counteroffensive would be needed, 50k or so. Also its not possible due to river to withdraw all at once so situation is kind of tragic (also supply outside pf bullets and food is bad, mortar shells for example). Oh and thete are hundreds of unburied bodies outside Bakhmur that are going to start smelling soon as spring comes.\n\nHe says that Ukrainian officer told him Zelensky was given falsely optimistic outlook of situation (like two viable roads when just one was left) even week ago and Lachowski thinks dismissing general Moskalev has to dovwith that too. Citation from that officer ''there are some of our higher commandets that are not able/dont know how to pass bad information upward''\n\n\n (i recently viewed interview with british volunteer Joseph MacDonald who was at one point adjutant of ukrainian colonel and said he resigned because the guy was nore interested withcomfy dacha that one with good comms and he spent time doing barbecues - but he said that ukr officet corps is incredibly mixed since other colonel he served undet was excellent  and i think its true)\n\nAlso, all the visitsl like Sirsky and change of Zelensky narration happrned after that. But he also believes that Bakhmut might have sense in large scale since it ties up Russians thete.\n\nThere is a lot more there since its hour long so let me add something weird, Russian army seems to be like caste army. There were supposedly sending convicts with headlights at night at Ukrainian positions but also after they got identified thete were guys with knives sneaking up on these positions slitting throats of Ukrainian guards.

There were supposedly sending convicts with headlights at night at Ukrainian positions but also after they got identified thete were guys with knives sneaking up on these positions slitting throats of Ukrainian guards. (Or more typically normal small team attacks from multiple directions, constantly)</p>\n</div>",

They can can last hours, days, or even weeks, designed to attit defenders through casualties, destruction of equipment, and heavy damage to defensive structures in an attempt to weaken defending units by 30-50% or more, with the Russian goal to try to go over than under for destruction. Those targets are found through intelligence, either ISR from drones, ground recon, or probing/recon-in-force attacks, or simply from learning from a deliberate attack that failed and readjusting with a new fires plan in between attacks.\n\nThe other type of fires they're using against defenders is suppressive. Those are the same targets that were previously getting hit by destructive fires who are also hit with fires while the attacking forces are maneuvering on the objective. Done poorly, they're inaccurate, too sporadic, and they lift or shift with too long of a delay before the attackers can start their attack and pick up the fire themselves to suppress the defenders. Done well, the fires might only lift-shift momentarily before the attackers are on the objective, down to seconds, with their fire replacing the artillery fires.\n\nThat is the problem with the Ukrainian strategic focus to defend positionally, \"hold at all cost,\" because they are deliberately putting their troops in those situations.\n\nHowever, there is a solution to that. Dig deep and fortify to such an extent that the defenses are nearly impervious to fires, to the point they're so well designed that defenders can actively man their firing positions and scan their sectors while still under heavy artillery fire (they can't be suppressed, at least not without repeated direct hits). And they need to be hidden so well that attackers have major problems finding and hitting them. Examples of that would be the Maginot Line in WW2 (which really were nearly invulnerable to frontal assaults), the Japanese on Peleliu or Iwo Jima, VC or NVA positions during the Vietnam War, modern North Korean positions on the DMZ, etc. They knew they were going to fight a fires centric opponent so needed to entrench and camouflage themselves to a degree that is still impressive to this day.\n\nBut that isn't really what is happening in Ukraine. Some locations are supposedly defended in that manner, with reinforced concrete bunkers on the front lines. But a lot of others are WW1 1914 era trenches, minimal overhead cover, minimal firing positions other than standing on a firing step to aim above the trench, etc. Those don't withstand heavy fires all that well against 152 and higher, and the defenders cannot man those positions while they're actively being fired on (they need to hide in dugouts with overhead cover). They are not camouflaged for shit, spoil is left everywhere around the tops of the trenches, shadows are obvious, so overhead drones can pick them up with ease. Buildings they use as strongpoints, or larger fieldworks identified through intelligence, are targeted and pounded with heavy preparatory fires and then suppressed when attacked.\n\nRegardless of a lack of data, without the UAF taking the defensive steps to make the Imperial Japanese Army on Iwo Jima looking like lazy pikers, they're going to get walloped and take heavy casualties fighting defensively. Its impossible not to. Even if they do take those abovementioned steps, if they don't retreat when their situations become increasingly untenable then like the IJA on Iwo Jima they're still going to take heavy casualties. Unavoidable, its just the nature of that style of warfare, its why few countries in history chose to defend at all cost every time they defended, with a preference over defending vs attacking, because its extremely costly.

The comment I was responding to stated that this war has been less costly for NATO than for Russia, therefore it doesn\u2019t make sense to think Russia can outlast NATO. I think this is an unhelpful way to understand the current (or any) conflict, because it\u2019s a matter of what each side is willing to pay and for how long, so merely noting that one side has borne a lower \u201ccost\u201d makes no sense. As evidence for this point, I point out that Russia has already borne a greater \u201ccost\u201d in this war than any Western country has in any conflict since WW2, and still it continues. \n\n\nI\u2019m not taking a stance on what the limit for either side actually is. I\u2019m merely pointing out that each side\u2019s limit is different. I think you\u2019re missing the forest of my point for the trees of \u201ccasualties\u201d; obviously those are only a factor for Russia (I\u2019m ignoring Ukraine here). I don\u2019t conclude that the US is unwilling to invest in defence (here I assume you mean give Ukraine weapons and money); it clearly is willing. It might continue to do so at current rates for the next 2-4 years and beyond for all I know, but that\u2019s a separate discussion. All of that to say, I think you\u2019re assuming I\u2019m taking a definitive stance on one side or the other\u2019s actual will to continue, which I\u2019m not. I just think OP\u2019s framing of the issue was incorrect.\n\n\n>\tbut in the last century it also dissolved twice when that tolerance gave out.\n\nI\u2019m no expert on Russian/Soviet history, but I will say that there was more to the overthrow of Nicholas II and collapse of the USSR than WW1 and Afghanistan.

The comment I was responding to stated that this war has been less costly for NATO than for Russia, therefore it doesn\u2019t make sense to think Russia can outlast NATO. I think this is an unhelpful way to understand the current (or any) conflict, because it\u2019s a matter of what each side is willing to pay and for how long, so merely noting that one side has borne a lower \u201ccost\u201d makes no sense. As evidence for this point, I point out that Russia has already borne a greater \u201ccost\u201d in this war than any Western country has in any conflict since WW2, and still it continues. </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m not taking a stance on what the limit for either side actually is. I\u2019m merely pointing out that each side\u2019s limit is different. I think you\u2019re missing the forest of my point for the trees of \u201ccasualties\u201d; obviously those are only a factor for Russia (I\u2019m ignoring Ukraine here). I don\u2019t conclude that the US is unwilling to invest in defence (here I assume you mean give Ukraine weapons and money); it clearly is willing. It might continue to do so at current rates for the next 2-4 years and beyond for all I know, but that\u2019s a separate discussion. All of that to say, I think you\u2019re assuming I\u2019m taking a definitive stance on one side or the other\u2019s actual will to continue, which I\u2019m not. I just think OP\u2019s framing of the issue was incorrect.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>but in the last century it also dissolved twice when that tolerance gave out.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I\u2019m no expert on Russian/Soviet history, but I will say that there was more to the overthrow of Nicholas II and collapse of the USSR than WW1 and Afghanistan. Learning about 1917 in particular was actually disheartening for me, because even after a brutal war and economic devastation there was still time for some incredible stupidity/incompetence on the part of the Romanovs before they were removed from power.</p>\n</div>",

Both Russia and Ukraine are putting major stocks into a strategy of attrition to try to decide the war, and its not working because (like nearly every time a strategy of attrition was used to guide a war) the math formulas they use miss countless variables that they didn't consider. \n\nFor manpower, both sides are mobilized at this point, so manpower isn't as big a deal as it used to be. Neither have a quality ability to reconstitute the force (though UA is better than RU), so quality drops, but they both regularly find ways to make up (usually with fires). But its a fool's errand at this point for Russia or Ukraine to think they're going to kill their way to victory. \n\nThe attrition that matters the most is artillery ammunition. While so many are focusing on daily fire rates and future ammo resupply, the dwindling tactical and operational stockpiles and need to constantly resupply them to support ongoing ops in lieu of future ops is extremely problematic for both sides, which is very detrimental to them both as they are both extremely fires centric by doctrine, have too much artillery in their TO&E, and need artillery superiority at a minimum to achieve success.  \n\nIf we want to talk about Bakhmut and attrition and who lost war then we should talk about resources, be it manpower or ammo, and which side will have a harder time replacing them without a serious degradation of future capabilities. \n\nIn all honesty, neither side seems to come out on top. The Russians consumed far more manpower and fires, but they had more to consume. The UAF definitely had better kill ratios, but they don't have enough troops or an effective system of replacing manpower losses while maintaining a semblance of quality, and their ammo resupply woes are far worse than Russia in the near term until western ammo manufacturing capabilities can turn the dial to 11, which will take years.",

While so many are focusing on daily fire rates and future ammo resupply, the dwindling tactical and operational stockpiles and need to constantly resupply them to support ongoing ops in lieu of future ops is extremely problematic for both sides, which is very detrimental to them both as they are both extremely fires centric by doctrine, have too much artillery in their TO&amp;E, and need artillery superiority at a minimum to achieve success.  </p>\n\n<p>If we want to talk about Bakhmut and attrition and who lost war then we should talk about resources, be it manpower or ammo, and which side will have a harder time replacing them without a serious degradation of future capabilities. </p>\n\n<p>In all honesty, neither side seems to come out on top. The Russians consumed far more manpower and fires, but they had more to consume. The UAF definitely had better kill ratios, but they don&#39;t have enough troops or an effective system of replacing manpower losses while maintaining a semblance of quality, and their ammo resupply woes are far worse than Russia in the near term until western ammo manufacturing capabilities can turn the dial to 11, which will take years.</p>\n</div>",

Then you wonder why your comments aren&#39;t being seen, make a new account, and then get Perma banned by reddit for &quot;ban evasion&quot;. Then you keep making accounts to make a comment here and there.  It sucks but you say the wrong thing on the wrong subreddit (like <a href=\"/r/conservative\">r/conservative</a>). And then boom ur done.  New account will be banned too after a couple days.  This is like my 10th reddit account because I had a differing opinion than a subreddit</p>\n</div>",
