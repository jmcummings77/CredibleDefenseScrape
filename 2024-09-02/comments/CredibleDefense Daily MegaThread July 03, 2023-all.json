The implication I got was flat plains favor the attacker and are difficult to defend. \n\nHowever what I've seen in this war has been different. Fighting on open terrain seems to have brought more grueling attritional warfare than blitzkrieg thunder runs.

I'm wondering what the reason for this is. \n\nHave plains become easier to defend with new technology such as drones, gps guided artillery, or anti-tank missiles?

            "body": "Flat open terrain can be great for fast armor/mechanized infantry to make big gains if they're relatively unopposed because they can pretty much just go, and it's generally harder for the defender to set up ambushes and whatnot if there's not much cover. This does, of course, assume that that open terrain is reasonably dry/firm and traversable by heavy equipment, which is definitely not always the case in that part of the world.\n\nBut anyways, the technologies that you mentioned definitely help the defender. In much of the past, being a quickly moving target tended to make you a lot harder to find and hit, but things like guided missiles and widespread drones have made it a lot easier to locate and attack armor. And then once you get into situations where you have more substantial prepared defenses like minefields and such, then the terrain effectively becomes way less 'open' even if visually it still looks pretty clear. \n\nBut even in this war, we have seen some areas of fairly rapid advances over that generally clear terrain. For example the initial stage of the invasion the Russian forces managed to extend a pretty good ways into south-eastern Ukraine in those first couple days. Or during the previous big Ukrainian counterattack in the north east, where once they routed the Russian's minimal defensive lines, they were pretty much 'off to the races' until they hit the border or some natural barrier like a big river. \n\nAnother factor worth considering in regards to this is logistics. Even if you've got a clear path in front of you, typically you don't want to send your forces too far ahead of the supply lines. Russia's logistics have been very bad at times, and looked to be downright awful during the beginning of their invasion. That likely helped limit their advances in the first days and gave the Ukrainians more time to get organized and set up defenses to slow and stall the Russian offensive.",

        "body": "So there was a recent Russia Contingency podcast with Kofman and  Sam Bendett on drones and desensitizing death. Here is a few points I found interesting.\n\nThe guest stated that Rusi estimates Ukraine loses up to 10,000 different UAV platforms a month. \n\nHe estimated that Russia loses about 3,000-4,000\n per month. \n\nThey were saying how we only see a small percentage of what is actually taking place (the success) and dont realize how many drones get lost.\n\n\nThe guest Sam was asked what distinct impressions has he has had from this war, he said the move away from expensive drones to cheap platforms. Cheap drones that can be seen as almost ammunition instead of platforms.\n\n\nIn Syria Russia was able to use dozens of types of drones freely, and when they came to Ukraine it was much different because of the air defense.\n\nAnother distinct impression he has had is the level of informal and volunteer assistance. Not only on Ukrainian side but also on the Russian side where volunteers are providing unprecedented levels of assistance on all levels of military operations in Ukraine.\n\n\n\"Ukrainian government and Ukrainian military has recognized the significance of this informal assistance, and they've been  able to establish networks where The government, the military, the volunteers, the private sector actually all work together with a war fighter to tease out the best lessons the best war technologies That could be useful. \n\nWe are actually starting to see that on the Russian side as well But the Russian military is resistant to this bottom up approach. Since the MOD is a much more vertical organization and wants to control...\"\n\n\nI think the internal politics of the MOD is a big downside for Russia.\n\nI'm curious how many of the drones from each side are from volunteers.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>So there was a recent Russia Contingency podcast with Kofman and  Sam Bendett on drones and desensitizing death. Here is a few points I found interesting.</p>\n\n<p>The guest stated that Rusi estimates Ukraine loses up to 10,000 different UAV platforms a month. </p>\n\n<p>He estimated that Russia loses about 3,000-4,000\n per month. </p>\n\n<p>They were saying how we only see a small percentage of what is actually taking place (the success) and dont realize how many drones get lost.</p>\n\n<p>The guest Sam was asked what distinct impressions has he has had from this war, he said the move away from expensive drones to cheap platforms. Cheap drones that can be seen as almost ammunition instead of platforms.</p>\n\n<p>In Syria Russia was able to use dozens of types of drones freely, and when they came to Ukraine it was much different because of the air defense.</p>\n\n<p>Another distinct impression he has had is the level of informal and volunteer assistance. Not only on Ukrainian side but also on the Russian side where volunteers are providing unprecedented levels of assistance on all levels of military operations in Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Ukrainian government and Ukrainian military has recognized the significance of this informal assistance, and they&#39;ve been  able to establish networks where The government, the military, the volunteers, the private sector actually all work together with a war fighter to tease out the best lessons the best war technologies That could be useful. </p>\n\n<p>We are actually starting to see that on the Russian side as well But the Russian military is resistant to this bottom up approach. Since the MOD is a much more vertical organization and wants to control...&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I think the internal politics of the MOD is a big downside for Russia.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m curious how many of the drones from each side are from volunteers. I know a lot of Russian drones come from volunteers. I wonder how long will these Russian volunteers be willing to foot the bill  if the MOD doesn&#39;t embrace and start producing/buying small quadcopters and fpv drones?</p>\n\n<p>Although I wonder if Russia&#39;s future drone factory set to open in 2024 will make a significant difference or not.

All of this was approved by Order 28 from the Land Operations Command (Coter), signed by General Estevam Cals Theophilo Gaspar de Oliveira. The 16-page document was published in Army Bulletin number 24 on June 16th.  \n>  \n>The Army intended to use the royalty money to develop new versions of the armored vehicle. The veto was revealed by reporter Paulo Roberto Bastos Jr. from the magazine Tecnologia & Defesa and confirmed by the column. When asked if they intended to comment on the Itamaraty's decision, the IDV stated that the case \"is a matter between countries.\" Therefore, it falls under the responsibility of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MRE). The MRE claimed secrecy and did not comment on the prohibition of the deal.  \n>  \n>**The MRE's decision is the latest development in one of the chapters of the dispute between the Itamaraty and the Armed Forces, due to different views between the formulators of the foreign policy of the PT government and military diplomacy.** It all started on April 27th. On that day, the Ukrainian military attach\u00e9, Colonel Volodymyr Savchenko, sent a document to the Minister of Defense, Jos\u00e9 M\u00facio Monteiro Filho, requesting the sale of up to 450 units of the ambulance version of the armored vehicle to the European country.  \n>  \n>**The armored vehicles would be painted in the colors of the Ukrainian emergency and rescue service to transport wounded and civilians safely out of combat zones. The request for the ambulance version was a way to acquire the equipment without conflicting with Brazil's government policy of neutrality in the war between Russia and Ukraine**, which started in 2021 with the invasion ordered by Russian leader Vladimir Putin. On May 9th, Celso Amorim, the president's special advisor, became aware of the request. He was in Kiev, where he was supposed to meet with the government of Volodmir Zelenski. He felt blindsided.  \n>  \n>In Bras\u00edlia, President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who was also unaware of the request, was questioned on the same day about the publication of the case by Estad\u00e3o, after confirmation obtained from the Ministry of Defense. The president was alongside Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and even classified the news as \"fake.\" It wasn't (in fact, as shown by the document below, published by the column on May 22nd).  \n>  \n>Returning to Brazil, **Amorim and Chancellor Mauro Vieira met with Lula. They wanted to put the military in their place, as they seemed to maintain a parallel diplomacy to that of the government**. PT deputies, such as Carlos Zarattini (SP), joined in. They believed that the sale of armored vehicles as desired by Ukraine would have consequences for the country's foreign policy - the PT government defends neutrality in the conflict.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\n* There is still visible mistrust between the armed forces of Brazil and the new PT government.\n* Lula and his advisor (also ex-minister of foreign affairs) Celso Amorim are committed to a policy of appeasement towards Russia, clothed in language of neutrality and peace-building. Whether this is an ideological (BRICS solidarity) or pragmatic stance (e.g. Brazil's reliance on Russian fertilizers) is unclear.\n* Armed forces leadership, historically and generally aligned to the U.S., seem to have a different understanding of the conflict and are more willing to cooperate with Ukraine.\n* The veto is seen as a blow to the Brazilian defense industry, which has been looking for buyers for its native APC design built in partnership with the Italian manucfaturing company IVECO.",

A reliable aircraft.\u201d\n\nThe rusting remains of the aircraft had been stripped of their most valuable components, including radios and machine guns, and dragged to the woodland.\n\nAccording to historians, some of these aircraft were deliberately broken up and buried after the war so the Soviets did not have to pay back the US, as under lend-lease legislation Moscow was required to pay for any donated military equipment that remained intact.\nUkraine\u2019s National Aviation Museum is aiming to reassemble the Hurricanes and put them on display.\n\n\u201cThe Hurricanes are a symbol of British assistance during the years of the second world war, just as we are very appreciative of British assistance nowadays,\u201d Valerii Romanenko, the head of research at the museum, told the BBC. \u201cThe UK is one of the largest suppliers of military equipment to our country now.\u201d\n\nIn mid-June, the emptying of the vast reservoir along the Dnipro River as a result of the destruction of the Kakhovka dam uncovered mudflats littered with skeletons, according to footage posted online.\nHistorians say some of the remains may be of people who died in a huge battle fought 80 years ago over the same terrain now at the centre of Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive against Russian occupation, around Nikopol and Kamianka-Dniprovska.\n\nThe battle of the Dnipro \u2013 or Dnieper, in the Russian version \u2013 was the focus of one of the biggest military operations of the second world war, the Soviet army\u2019s counterattack against the German army, involving more than 6 million troops.",

The factory in Alabuga is 40,000 sq m (6 soccer fields) and will be expanded into an entire village. Iran is providing technical documentation, spare parts, and staff training.\n\n[Alabuga: Iranian Drones Under Franchise](https://protokol.band/2023/07/03/alabuga-iranian-drones/)\n\n>Currently, the cooperation is limited to the delivery of ready-made drones to Russia. One of our sources confirms this and claims to have personally seen a document signed by Sergei Shoigu, the Russian Minister of Defense, approving the financing of the Iranian drone procurement project. The source asserts that this document later went for signing to Vladimir Putin.  \n>  \n>The estimated value of the contract with Iran, according to our source, is currently around 115-130 billion rubles. Currently, the components for the \u00abShahed\u00bb drones are entirely supplied from Iran, with the final assembly taking place in Alabuga. One of the interviewees states that the supply organization is primitive. In the early stages of the cooperation, the scheme looked as follows: the aircraft would depart from Iran, land in Moscow for inspection, and then fly to Begishevo Airport in Nizhnekamsk. From there, the contents of the aircraft were transported to Alabuga using private trucks. Currently, the planes fly directly to Begishevo.  \n>  \n>Now let\u2019s talk about the secrecy surrounding the project. From the very beginning, the management refers to the \u00abShahed\u00bb drones as \u00abboats\u00bb in some internal documents, and Iran is referred to as Belarus. An internal presentation with preliminary layouts of production workshops and the production scheme has been obtained by the editorial team. The title page reads \u00abBoat Project\u00bb but the second-to-last slide depicts the \u00abShahed\u00bb drone. One of our sources speculates that this renaming in internal documents might be the reason why \u00abThe Guardian\u00bb publication mentions boats in the delivery scheme, despite the drones being transported by planes.  \n>  \n>The agreement with Iran entails comprehensive training of specialists from Alabuga at Iranian production facilities. The first educational trip took place in March 2023. Currently, senior specialists and the main managerial staff are undergoing training. Through this collaboration, Alabuga plans to train over 200 individuals in Iran. Subsequently, training for \u00abintermediate specialists\u00bb is planned, and eventually, students will also be included.  \n>  \n>Simultaneously, the Iranian side is providing layouts, equipment lists, technological processes, process maps, and design documentation. Iranian and Russian engineers collaborate to refine and adapt this documentation and processes to Russian realities and needs. This involves bilateral meetings where Iranian and Russian specialists discuss the adaptation process. For example, they discuss which modules can be replaced and with what, so that Alabuga can purchase them without difficulties instead of setting up its own production in the initial stages.  \n>  \n>The agreement also includes the delivery of a complete package of components, which are assembled in Alabuga. By early March, around 70 \u00abShahed\u00bb drones had been delivered to Russia from Iran. These were just the first two shipments within a two-week period. It appears that they are already in operation, as on March 26, the UK Ministry of Defense reported that since the beginning of March, Russia has likely deployed at least 71 Iranian drones across Ukrainian territory. The source emphasizes that Alabuga did not directly purchase the \u00abShahed\u00bb drones themselves. Instead, they acquired the right to organize a turnkey drone production. In simple terms, they obtained a \u00abfranchise\u00bb.  \n>  \n>According to the plan, the number of imported components from Iran will gradually decrease in the future. The first components to be removed from the list of imports will be the shell because they are easy to produce. Next, they will eliminate the electronics since the GPS module and processor in the \u00abShahed\u00bb drones are quite primitive, using technology from the 1990s. They will be bought from \u00abAliExpress\u00bb. Following the electronics, Alabuga plans to learn how to manufacture engines.  \n>  \n>Even before Alabuga, Russia directly procured gasoline engines for its drones from the Japanese company \u00abSaito Seisakusho\u00bb. When this became known, the company terminated its relationship with Russia. Iranian manufacturers produce similar engines using a technology widely used in the first half of the 20th century, where earth is used instead of molds for casting the engine.  \n>  \n>The most challenging aspect of production is the combat component. For some time, Iran will only supply the combat component. In an attempt to solve the issue of manufacturing the combat component, Alabuga employees held negotiations with various manufacturers, including \u00abKalashnikov\u00bb. However, the negotiations did not lead to anything. Building production from scratch is not overly difficult but requires fulfilling numerous conditions and norms. For example, the facility must be located in a vast pit with no structures within a radius of several kilometers. Alabuga considered this option, but its implementation will take time. Complete cessation of component imports from Iran will take two to three years.  \n>  \n>We obtained an interesting document \u2014 a relatively small but sufficiently detailed Excel table with questions addressed to the Iranian side regarding drones. The source claims that this document was compiled at the very beginning of the collaboration. The questions are divided into three columns: topic, question, and translation of the question into English. In an additional left column, companies are listed: \u00abAlbatross\u00bb, \u00abAviatestAero\u00bb, \u00abSuperCam\u00bb and \u00abAlabuga\u00bb. All of them are somehow related not only to drone production but also to the SEZ. The questions linked to the production of combat drones and their individual parts.  \n>  \n>One of the sources reveals that there were initial problems with financing the Russian-Iranian deal. After reaching an agreement on purchasing the franchise and determining the amount, it turned out that Iran did not need rubles. Initially, they demanded payment in gold. The Russian side managed to gather the necessary amount of the precious metal, and according to the source, an entire plane loaded with gold was being prepared for shipment. At the last moment, Iran changed its mind and wanted payment in dollars. Everything came to a halt as the Iranians insisted on cash payment, and Russia simply did not have such a quantity of dollars available.  \n>  \n>Not only Iran constantly changed its demands. The mentioned document, signed by Sergey Shoigu and subsequently Vladimir Putin, according to the source, stipulated financing in the amount of 80 billion rubles. In reality, it turned out to be too much money for organizing production, and only 30 billion rubles were allocated. How exactly Alabuga looked for additional funding of 50 billion rubles is not known for certain. However, according to the source, they managed to find it. One of the interlocutors mentioned rumors that the funds were provided by the head of VTB Bank, Andrey Kostin. Indirectly supporting this theory is the launch of VTB\u2019s money transfer service to Iran in December 2022 and the opening of a bank office in the country, which became known in May 2023.  \n>  \n>In Alabuga has been organized an unprecedented production of Iranian drones. Currently, in the initial stage of cooperation, the hangar occupies 40,000 square meters, approximately the size of six football fields. It is important to mention the stages themselves. The first stage, which is nearing completion, involves simple assembly from ready-made parts. Over the next year, the management of Alabuga plans to move the production of some components to the economic zone and then automate the production process. According to information from one of our sources, the assembly efficiency is expected to surpass the Iranian one by tens of times, and the total area of the hangars will exceed 100,000 square meters. Essentially, it will be a separate village solely dedicated to producing drones for the Russian army.\n\nA new series of Shahed's has already appeared in Ukraine, suggesting that the first drones assembled in Russia have already arrived:\n\n[https://twitter.com/imp\\_navigator/status/1675921873010319361?s=20](https://twitter.com/imp_navigator/status/1675921873010319361?s=20)\n\n>The Ukrainian military said that they had shot down a new model of the Geranium UAV on the territory of the DPR controlled by the Kyiv regime. First of all, the Y002 series draws attention to itself. It can be assumed that this is the designation of an experimental batch of drones, the production of which is deployed in the city of Yelabuga in Tatarstan. Also on this sample is a slightly different form of wingtip casting - the influx on it is less pronounced. This also speaks in favor of a new place of production.",

Indirectly supporting this theory is the launch of VTB\u2019s money transfer service to Iran in December 2022 and the opening of a bank office in the country, which became known in May 2023.  </p>\n\n<p>In Alabuga has been organized an unprecedented production of Iranian drones. Currently, in the initial stage of cooperation, the hangar occupies 40,000 square meters, approximately the size of six football fields. It is important to mention the stages themselves. The first stage, which is nearing completion, involves simple assembly from ready-made parts. Over the next year, the management of Alabuga plans to move the production of some components to the economic zone and then automate the production process. According to information from one of our sources, the assembly efficiency is expected to surpass the Iranian one by tens of times, and the total area of the hangars will exceed 100,000 square meters. Essentially, it will be a separate village solely dedicated to producing drones for the Russian army.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A new series of Shahed&#39;s has already appeared in Ukraine, suggesting that the first drones assembled in Russia have already arrived:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/imp_navigator/status/1675921873010319361?s=20\">https://twitter.com/imp_navigator/status/1675921873010319361?s=20</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Ukrainian military said that they had shot down a new model of the Geranium UAV on the territory of the DPR controlled by the Kyiv regime. First of all, the Y002 series draws attention to itself. It can be assumed that this is the designation of an experimental batch of drones, the production of which is deployed in the city of Yelabuga in Tatarstan. Also on this sample is a slightly different form of wingtip casting - the influx on it is less pronounced. This also speaks in favor of a new place of production.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

After it invaded Ukraine, its demand grew for more surveillance tools.

The tools offer ways to track certain kinds of activity on encrypted apps like WhatsApp and Signal, monitor the locations of phones, identify anonymous social media users and break into people\u2019s accounts, according to documents from Russian surveillance providers obtained by The New York Times, as well as security experts, digital activists and a person involved with the country\u2019s digital surveillance operations.\n\n>President Vladimir V. Putin is leaning more on technology to wield political power as Russia faces military setbacks in Ukraine, bruising economic sanctions and leadership challenges after an uprising led by Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, the commander of the Wagner paramilitary group. In doing so, Russia \u2014 which once lagged authoritarian regimes like China and Iran in using modern technology to exert control \u2014 is quickly catching up.\n\n>\u201cIt\u2019s made people very paranoid, because if you communicate with anyone in Russia, you can\u2019t be sure whether it\u2019s secure or not.

Now they have expanded it to anyone who disagrees with the war.\u201d\n\n>The effort has fed the coffers of a constellation of relatively unknown Russian technology firms. Many are owned by Citadel Group, a business once partially controlled by Alisher Usmanov, who was a target of European Union sanctions as one of Mr. Putin\u2019s \u201cfavorite oligarchs.\u201d Some of the companies are trying to expand overseas, raising the risk that the technologies do not remain inside Russia.\n\n>The firms \u2014 with names like MFI Soft, Vas Experts and Protei \u2014 generally got their start building pieces of Russia\u2019s invasive telecom wiretapping system before producing more advanced tools for the country\u2019s intelligence services.\n\n>Simple-to-use software that plugs directly into the telecommunications infrastructure now provides a Swiss-army knife of spying possibilities, according to the documents, which include engineering schematics, emails and screen shots. The Times obtained hundreds of files from a person with access to the internal records, about 40 of which detailed the surveillance tools.\n\n>One program outlined in the materials can identify when people make voice calls or send files on encrypted chat apps such as Telegram, Signal and WhatsApp. **The software cannot intercept specific messages, but can determine whether someone is using multiple phones, map their relationship network by tracking communications with others, and triangulate what phones have been in certain locations on a given day.** Another product can collect passwords entered on unencrypted websites.\n\n>These technologies complement other Russian efforts to shape public opinion and stifle dissent, like a propaganda blitz on state media, more robust internet censorship and new efforts to collect data on citizens and encourage them to report social media posts that undermine the war.\n\n>They add up to the beginnings of an off-the-shelf tool kit for autocrats who wish to gain control of what is said and done online. One document outlining the capabilities of various tech providers referred to a \u201cwiretap market,\u201d a supply chain of equipment and software that pushes the limits of digital mass surveillance.\n\n>The authorities are \u201cessentially incubating a new cohort of Russian companies that have sprung up as a result of the state\u2019s repressive interests,\u201d said Adrian Shahbaz, a vice president of research and analysis at the pro-democracy advocacy group Freedom House, who studies online oppression. \u201cThe spillover effects will be felt first in the surrounding region, then potentially the world.\u201d\n\n>>Beyond the \u2018Wiretap Market\u2019\n\n>Over the past two decades, Russian leaders struggled to control the internet. To remedy that, they ordered up systems to eavesdrop on phone calls and unencrypted text messages. Then they demanded that providers of internet services store records of all internet traffic.\n\n>The expanding program \u2014 formally known as the System for Operative Investigative Activities, or SORM \u2014 was an imperfect means of surveillance. Russia\u2019s telecom providers often incompletely installed and updated the technologies, meaning the system did not always work properly. The volume of data pouring in could be overwhelming and unusable.\n\n>At first, the technology was used against political rivals like supporters of Aleksei A. Navalny, the jailed opposition leader. Demand for the tools increased after the invasion of Ukraine, digital rights experts said. Russian authorities turned to local tech companies that built the old surveillance systems and asked for more.\n\n>The push benefited companies like Citadel, which had bought many of Russia\u2019s biggest makers of digital wiretapping equipment and controls about 60 to 80 percent of the market for telecommunications monitoring technology, according to the U.S. State Department. The United States announced sanctions against Citadel and its current owner, Anton Cherepennikov, in February.\n\n>\u201cSectors connected to the military and communications are getting a lot of funding right now as they adapt to new demands,\u201d said Ksenia Ermoshina, a senior researcher who studies Russian surveillance companies with Citizen Lab, a research institute at the University of Toronto.\n\n>The new technologies give Russia\u2019s security services a granular view of the internet. A tracking system from one Citadel subsidiary, MFI Soft, helps display information about telecom subscribers, along with statistical breakdowns of their internet traffic, on a specialized control panel for use by regional F.S.B. officers, according to one chart.\n\n>Another MFI Soft tool, NetBeholder, can map the locations of two phones over the course of the day to discern whether they simultaneously ran into each other, indicating a potential meeting between people.\n\n>A different feature, which uses location tracking to check whether several phones are frequently in the same area, deduces whether someone might be using two or more phones. With full access to telecom network subscriber information, NetBeholder\u2019s system can also pinpoint the region in Russia each user is from or what country a foreigner comes from.\n\n>Protei, another company, offers products that provide voice-to-text transcription for intercepted phone calls and tools for identifying \u201csuspicious behavior,\u201d according to one document.\n\n>Russia\u2019s enormous data collection and the new tools make for a \u201ckiller combo,\u201d said Ms. Ermoshina, who added that such capabilities are increasingly widespread across the country.\n\n>VAS Experts said the need for its tools had \u201cincreased due to the complex geopolitical situation\u201d and volume of threats inside Russia. It said it \u201cdevelops telecom products which include tools for lawful interception and which are used by F.S.B. officers who fight against terrorism,\u201d adding that if the technology \u201cwill save at least one life and people well-being then we work for a reason.\u201d",

The Times obtained hundreds of files from a person with access to the internal records, about 40 of which detailed the surveillance tools.</p>\n\n<p>One program outlined in the materials can identify when people make voice calls or send files on encrypted chat apps such as Telegram, Signal and WhatsApp. <strong>The software cannot intercept specific messages, but can determine whether someone is using multiple phones, map their relationship network by tracking communications with others, and triangulate what phones have been in certain locations on a given day.</strong> Another product can collect passwords entered on unencrypted websites.</p>\n\n<p>These technologies complement other Russian efforts to shape public opinion and stifle dissent, like a propaganda blitz on state media, more robust internet censorship and new efforts to collect data on citizens and encourage them to report social media posts that undermine the war.</p>\n\n<p>They add up to the beginnings of an off-the-shelf tool kit for autocrats who wish to gain control of what is said and done online. One document outlining the capabilities of various tech providers referred to a \u201cwiretap market,\u201d a supply chain of equipment and software that pushes the limits of digital mass surveillance.</p>\n\n<p>The authorities are \u201cessentially incubating a new cohort of Russian companies that have sprung up as a result of the state\u2019s repressive interests,\u201d said Adrian Shahbaz, a vice president of research and analysis at the pro-democracy advocacy group Freedom House, who studies online oppression. \u201cThe spillover effects will be felt first in the surrounding region, then potentially the world.\u201d</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Beyond the \u2018Wiretap Market\u2019</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Over the past two decades, Russian leaders struggled to control the internet. To remedy that, they ordered up systems to eavesdrop on phone calls and unencrypted text messages. Then they demanded that providers of internet services store records of all internet traffic.</p>\n\n<p>The expanding program \u2014 formally known as the System for Operative Investigative Activities, or SORM \u2014 was an imperfect means of surveillance. Russia\u2019s telecom providers often incompletely installed and updated the technologies, meaning the system did not always work properly. The volume of data pouring in could be overwhelming and unusable.</p>\n\n<p>At first, the technology was used against political rivals like supporters of Aleksei A. Navalny, the jailed opposition leader. Demand for the tools increased after the invasion of Ukraine, digital rights experts said. Russian authorities turned to local tech companies that built the old surveillance systems and asked for more.</p>\n\n<p>The push benefited companies like Citadel, which had bought many of Russia\u2019s biggest makers of digital wiretapping equipment and controls about 60 to 80 percent of the market for telecommunications monitoring technology, according to the U.S. State Department. The United States announced sanctions against Citadel and its current owner, Anton Cherepennikov, in February.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cSectors connected to the military and communications are getting a lot of funding right now as they adapt to new demands,\u201d said Ksenia Ermoshina, a senior researcher who studies Russian surveillance companies with Citizen Lab, a research institute at the University of Toronto.</p>\n\n<p>The new technologies give Russia\u2019s security services a granular view of the internet. A tracking system from one Citadel subsidiary, MFI Soft, helps display information about telecom subscribers, along with statistical breakdowns of their internet traffic, on a specialized control panel for use by regional F.S.B. officers, according to one chart.</p>\n\n<p>Another MFI Soft tool, NetBeholder, can map the locations of two phones over the course of the day to discern whether they simultaneously ran into each other, indicating a potential meeting between people.</p>\n\n<p>A different feature, which uses location tracking to check whether several phones are frequently in the same area, deduces whether someone might be using two or more phones. With full access to telecom network subscriber information, NetBeholder\u2019s system can also pinpoint the region in Russia each user is from or what country a foreigner comes from.</p>\n\n<p>Protei, another company, offers products that provide voice-to-text transcription for intercepted phone calls and tools for identifying \u201csuspicious behavior,\u201d according to one document.</p>\n\n<p>Russia\u2019s enormous data collection and the new tools make for a \u201ckiller combo,\u201d said Ms. Ermoshina, who added that such capabilities are increasingly widespread across the country.</p>\n\n<p>VAS Experts said the need for its tools had \u201cincreased due to the complex geopolitical situation\u201d and volume of threats inside Russia. It said it \u201cdevelops telecom products which include tools for lawful interception and which are used by F.S.B. officers who fight against terrorism,\u201d adding that if the technology \u201cwill save at least one life and people well-being then we work for a reason.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

He was quizzed over his links to Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin over several days last week at an undisclosed location, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.\n\n>The \u201cattempt to destabilize the situation in Russia\u201d failed because the armed forces \u201cremained true to their oath\u201d Shoigu told officers at the Defense Ministry meeting broadcast Monday on state TV, in his first public comments on the uprising. \u201cThe provocation didn\u2019t affect\u201d Russia\u2019s military operations in Ukraine, he said.\n\n>The insurrection by the one-time ally of President Vladimir Putin spiraled into the biggest threat to the Russian leader\u2019s 24-year rule and has left unanswered questions about the extent to which elements in the military may have known in advance about Prigozhin\u2019s plans. Wagner forces came within 200 kilometers (124 miles) of Moscow facing little opposition before halting their advance after Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko brokered a deal to end the crisis.\n\n>Under that agreement, Putin pledged to allow Prigozhin to move to Belarus as well as any Wagner fighters who wanted to join him. Criminal investigations into Wagner on accusations of armed uprising were also closed.\n\n>Putin Claims He\u2019s Back in Control. Russia\u2019s Elite Isn\u2019t Sure\n\n>A June 26-30 survey of 1,599 people conducted by the Russian Field polling agency showed the proportion of Russians holding a favorable opinion of Prigozhin\u2019s role in the war in Ukraine plunged to 29% from 55% in a similar poll just before the rebellion. The number viewing him negatively rose to 39% from 14% in the June 16-19 poll.\n\n>While Lukashenko said last week that Prigozhin had arrived in Belarus, the Wagner founder hasn\u2019t been seen since late on June 24 and his social media channels have all gone silent.\n\n>Shoigu made no mention of the number of Wagner fighters who\u2019d agreed to sign contracts with the Defense Ministry by a July 1 deadline that was a spark for the mutiny. Prigozhin had accused Shoigu of attempting to \u201cdestroy\u201d Wagner, whose troops have played a key role in Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, particularly in fighting over the eastern city of Bakhmut.\n\n>There are other signs that Prigozhin\u2019s legacy in Russia is being dismantled. His Russian media operations are being wound up and websites belonging to his \u201cPatriot\u201d group have been blocked by regulators, the Izvestia newspaper reported Friday.\n\n>Ukraine\u2019s military is continuing to press its counteroffensive aimed at retaking parts of southern and eastern Ukraine occupied by Russian forces. Putin announced Russia was annexing four regions of Ukraine in September even as his troops don\u2019t fully control the territories.\n\n>The president held a televised meeting Monday with the head of Russia\u2019s central election committee, Ella Pamfilova, who told him plans were in place to hold regional elections in occupied regions of Ukraine in September, though the votes could be postponed if the situation deteriorated.\n\nHave seen a claim that the family was told he would be returned to them by July 4^th. Contrasting whatever is or isn't going on with Surovikin, Shoigu has very much been kept in the public eye, so the probability that he'll be replaced any time soon seems to be quite low at this point.",

            "body": "I just dont think non-violent resistance is really all that effective against an invader willing to resort to widespread brutality to get their way. And the author's choice of examples are..... not great. \n\nThe first is the Prague Spring, where the Soviets invaded their fraternal brother, Czechoslovakia, in order to reassert Moscow doctrine over the unorthodox Dubcek government. The article paints this as a neat 'compromise' between Moscow and Prague, in which some things were retained and some given up. If only, the author had wondered, the people of the street had been a little more committed to the movement then greater success might have been had. I disagree with this reading, the Czechs gave up the most important two things they could. Dubcek was removed from office and soft-purged, as was the style of the time, and never again had an important role in communist Czechoslovakia. I think he went off to, literally, plant trees in eastern Slovakia until 89. And the core ideology of the street, 'socialism with a human face' was abandoned for a more orthodox Brezhnev-ism. Which was like Stalinism minus the violence or Kruschevism minus the hair-brained schemes (ie the fun). Thats the ball game. What more could the Czechs have given up? What more did the Russians want? The Prague Spring *failed* because the Soviets resorted to a violent takeover. Had the people remained on the streets, as they did when Soviet tanks moved into German cities in 1953, they would have quickly learned that the Soviets werent deterred by leaflets and graffiti. If you dont care how many people get hurt, violence wins every time. \n\nAnd then there is this discussion of Denmark as some great resister against Nazism? Which starts in their glory covered six hour military resistance against the invasion, followed by non-violent protests and wars long \"resistance\" movement that failed to evict Germany before the allies did. Its quite a mysterious example, as a lot of the historiography of Danish resistance paints it in a rather negative light. The core moment of triumph was the smuggling out of about 7k Jews into Sweden, which is indeed a good thing! Of course it had a ton of help from the inside, including a sympathetic German officer who leaked the plan days in advance and without whom none of that would have been possible. But the narrative ignores many other aspects of the Danish resistance. For example the rabid nationalism, or the violence it focused on Danish \"\"collaborators\"\" including a 16 yr old orphan girl who the resistance killed for sleeping with a 19yr old conscript in 1944. Instead the article swallows whole the post-war line about the heroic \"defense of the nation.\" Also ignored is the collaboration played by the Danish SS, the units raised in country and supplied to the German army, the role of every day informants in suppressing political resistance in country. \n\nThe fact of the matter is, non-violent resistance doesnt really work against violent attacks unless there is some guilt that can be leveraged against the aggressor. And then it only matters if the aggressor *feels guilty* or its attacks place some intolerable internal pressure on the system. Pictures of dogs biting black students placed a lot of pressure on the US system to change, mostly because northern and westerners disliked seeing the violence unleashed on non-violent protestors. But just in the south, there was far more limited changes made and the violence used was seen as either justified or excusable. If it had been down to them alone, non-violence would not have worked. The same question applies to Ukraine. If the Russian people and government arnt compelled to stop the violence against Ukrainians, indeed if the violence is a component of government policy, it seems like it would be hard to stop or restrain. Who exactly would compel the Russians to stop? They dont care much what the US thinks or says about them. So were loop back on ourselves. There is a point at which simple talk doesn't solve problems, and the appropriate response to a provocative action is 'oh yeah? You and what army?' This war is proof to me of a just war, in which one side is trying to preserve its existence, independance, and way of life and the other is willing to resort to any amount of violence to compel the other side into change. Ukraine isn't a criminal state, its way of life was perfectly in keeping with global norms and European values, there is no reason why it should change. And no reason why it cant use violence to preserve its way of life. Pacifists have never been able to explain why violence is such an effective tool for control when extolling the virtues of non-violence.

But having a military is part of it too.\n\nThe article basically uses examples like the Danes and Norwegians, who used malicious compliance and a strong anti-work effort to tie up a bunch of Nazi resources and avoid contributing to the Nazi war effort as much as possible. I'm assuming that was pretty effective, it sure sounds like it has a lot of potential in the article. But another important part of the equation was the British, Americans, and USSR actually fighting the Germans, though the article doesn't seem to dwell on that part so much. To use an analogy from this subreddit, you want combined arms warfare, both an actual military response and additionally the nonviolent resistance of people in the occupied territory.\n\nGenerally speaking, I'm seeing the same thing in their examples from the USSR. Although there wasn't a world war going on when the USSR went into Czechoslovakia, the USSR was engaged in the cold war and was sensitive to the optics because of that. If the USSR had, say, conquered all of Europe at the end of WW2 I'm betting the Czech example would have ended differently.\n\nAnyway, I think that Ukraine's occupied territories, at least the ones occupied since 2022, are following this plan. We saw a lot of protests during the initial invasion, and they likely tied up a lot of resources that contributed to the initial Russian failure. I'm betting Russia isn't getting a lot of economic productivity out of the occupied regions either. So Ukraine seems to be following the playbook to me.",

There seems to be a pattern of (controlled or not) leaks from the German side every time such issues arise but I haven't seen anything officially released afterwards.\n\nNo, we never had never anything from official sources, only in the press. In the end we have 2 conflicting PoVs.\n\nGerman PoV: KMW asked for a location to set up their independent shop but was denied by the Polish government because it this would only be possible if a Polish state-owned company took the lead in this operation. KMW (a private company) declined because this would also only be possible with the transfer of trade secrets to Polish industry.\n\nPolish PoV (I only read this on Reddit/Twitter, not from actual Polish news sources): KMW was offered multiple locations but demanded state-owned facilities that are currently in active use (for the production of Krabs, etc.). This was declined by Poland.\n\nI personally find the German PoV more likely (but I'm also biased), mainly because the shop that they set up in Slovakia in the end is more or less an improvised tent.\n\n>Why is location such a big deal anyways, can't the repairs be performed in Germany in the first place? This would probably add about 12 hours to the transport time (24h both ways) but in the end you would have saved weeks spent on negotiations.\n\nNot 100% sure be honest.

There seems to be a pattern of (controlled or not) leaks from the German side every time such issues arise but I haven&#39;t seen anything officially released afterwards.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>No, we never had never anything from official sources, only in the press. In the end we have 2 conflicting PoVs.</p>\n\n<p>German PoV: KMW asked for a location to set up their independent shop but was denied by the Polish government because it this would only be possible if a Polish state-owned company took the lead in this operation. KMW (a private company) declined because this would also only be possible with the transfer of trade secrets to Polish industry.</p>\n\n<p>Polish PoV (I only read this on Reddit/Twitter, not from actual Polish news sources): KMW was offered multiple locations but demanded state-owned facilities that are currently in active use (for the production of Krabs, etc.). This was declined by Poland.</p>\n\n<p>I personally find the German PoV more likely (but I&#39;m also biased), mainly because the shop that they set up in Slovakia in the end is more or less an improvised tent.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why is location such a big deal anyways, can&#39;t the repairs be performed in Germany in the first place? This would probably add about 12 hours to the transport time (24h both ways) but in the end you would have saved weeks spent on negotiations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Not 100% sure be honest.

If we finally start seeing 1\u041a\u0418s in numbers, it's a good bet that Ramenskoye came up with, if not an original design, at least one that's well adapted for supply chain restrictions, and we've not seen too many of them because it was just cheaper and faster to get them from Thales. If we don't, it's a good bet that it's basically a 1:1 copy and they can't manufacture it in numbers because they can't source the components.\n\nEdit: FWIW, I feel dirty for saying it but I'm actually rooting for Ramenskoye here.

If we finally start seeing 1\u041a\u0418s in numbers, it&#39;s a good bet that Ramenskoye came up with, if not an original design, at least one that&#39;s well adapted for supply chain restrictions, and we&#39;ve not seen too many of them because it was just cheaper and faster to get them from Thales. If we don&#39;t, it&#39;s a good bet that it&#39;s basically a 1:1 copy and they can&#39;t manufacture it in numbers because they can&#39;t source the components.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: FWIW, I feel dirty for saying it but I&#39;m actually rooting for Ramenskoye here. Things like these are a much-needed wake-up call for the European defence industry.</p>\n</div>",
