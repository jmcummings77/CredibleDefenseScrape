At best, a brigade in action consists of two or three companies advancing with artillery support.\n* Best thing western supporters can do is not to make Ukraine fight like a western force, but in the way they best know how.\n* \"We haven't seen all the new brigades employed up until maybe about this morning, but it does look like the remainder of the newer units available to 10th Corps have been used in some way, shape, or form\".\n* \"Some 9th Corps brigades were pulled off the line for weak performance.\"\n* Western equipment is much more survivable. Also has good nighttime capabilities, but Ukrainians were unable to make the most of it because of lack of training.\n* Ukraine has an advantage in tube, but not MLRS, artillery.\n* Russian military has been conserving and rationing ammunition, which Kofman observed at the front.\n* Russia is constrained by ammunition, not artillery pieces, despite the destruction of the latter.\n* Russian counterbattery relies on Lancet drones, FPV drones, and attack helicopters.\n* Russian military is on the worse end of the attrition curve, but their lines are not thin or lacking for reserves.\n* The shock effect of western equipment was squandered in the initial assault.\n* The course of the offensive will become clearer in the coming days as the 10th Corps is fed into the fight.\n* \"Based on the last seven weeks, I'm more pessimistic than I was at the outset.\" However, Ukraine has adapted, and \"if the West can resource this strategy, it can create real problems for the Russian forces.

Since that failed, so it should reorient to the needs of dismounted infantry.\n* Ukraine needs ISR, drones, pick-up trucks, replacement parts, 3D-printing machines, night vision, and most of all, ammunition.\n* F-16s are a long-term program, will not be relevant this year, and something of a red herring. Given that Ukraine has trouble performing land operations at scale, it cannot be assumed that they can easily integrate and coordinate the additional complexity of air power at the level of the USAF.\n* In the coming days, monitor the Orikhiv axis for progress and see if 10th Corps can perform to judge where the offensive is going.\n* Ukraine deployed some of the weaker units to defend the Svatove/Kremmina line. Russia took advantage of that vulnerability and achieved a minor breakthrough there. Ukraine will likely deploy reserves to stem the advance.",

Which was designed for this exact fight. That fight didn't happen because nukes. \n\npro-Ukraine supports rant and wave about all that equipment the West produces that needs to go to Ukraine. Did you ever think someone designed it because they know what they're doing? Or created tactics, techniques, and procedures to know how to use it?\n\nWhy do the Ukrainians need it? Why is it that it's better than the trash they had? Way is it that they need the West to train them how to use it? The US Army doesn't know how to use tanks, and IFV, and arty. Not even their own stuff. Only Ukraine does! \n\nHow about that strategic intelligence we give Ukraine to fight effectively? Do you think that just appeared one day by accident? A gigantic super expensive fleet of satellites just miraculously existed with no understanding how to use it until the Ukrainians taught us how?\n\nThe arrogance of the pro-Ukraine war tourists is maddening. The West literally wrote the book on modern warfare but we don't actually know that we're going because WW3 never happened. Forget planning, forget training, forget validating theory in previous wars, using the lessons from every war we can study especially those we didn't participate and applying lessons. We're amateurs, Ukraine are pros. That's why they can't run ops at the brigade level. That's why they don't even have division level commands. That's why they have max of 5 weeks of basic training for junior troops. That's why brand new lieutenants with zero military experience [get a whole 4 weeks before leading platoons](https://www.economist.com/1843/2022/10/06/the-secret-diary-of-a-ukrainian-soldier-learning-to-kill).\n\nBecause they know what near peer is all about! Not the West, we're just virgins to war...\n\n>Maybe we should look at this as a wake up call that \"NATO standards\"\n\nWhat standards?\n\nRecognize that NATO standardization doesn't exist. Do you think it's an organization where everyone wears the same uniform, uses the same equipment, fights the same way? \n\nHave you ever even looked at who's in NATO? Most of the countries suck far worse than Ukraine ever did at its worst.

Funny enough, it wasn't air defenses, it was fear of the Russians hitting all of the European airfields and C2 centers, especially involving joint targeting, early in a war with their long-range ballistics missiles.

We regularly test and analyze Russian radar systems all the time during peacetime, we use espionage to do it, we were doing it all the time in Syria, and we are doing it in this war. If they know how their radars work, then they can make the systems or EW to deal with them. \n\nThat was why Russians got caught a bit flat footed early in the war. They knew the Ukrainian air defenses were using Soviet era S-300 and other types, and they had the known countermeasures for those systems.

They were created way to late to have a chance of being used effectively in a summer offensive. Too many poorly trained battalion and brigade officer due to a system that can't train their existing prior service officers to a higher standard. Lower level personnel didn't get good trained at the individual level, especially not using brand new equipment they never used before and is a much higher level of technology than even the random veterans are used to. And the units that did get combined arms battalion level unit training (not all of them), it wasn't long enough, definitely not taught to a high standard, and didn't use Ukraine TTPs, which was an absolute mistake. \n\nKofman added to that with hints in one of his last podcasts that the UAF did the old shell game of unloading turds from veteran units to serve as cadre for the new units when taskings when out (\"Every battalion with provide x amount of y to leave your unit and report to 47th Bde\"). A game as old as time itself, and one the UAF General Staff should have been on the lookout for!\n\nThe alternative is to take a veteran unit, say the 3rd Assault Brigade, which seems to be more like a division at this point in terms of the amount of maneuver battalions it has, and pull them to the strategic reserve to serve as the future offensive force. They are more competent than a brand new unit created in January or February, especially one filled with a turd cadre. With six months to prep, they can spend the whole time just learning new equipment and training a bit more on the combined arms breach, especially using their own TTPs and organic equipment. They'd probably have done a lot better. \n\nBut then the UAF couldn't have fought the battle of Bakhmut if they did that, they'd need to have retreated as soon as possible to hold a shorter and more defensible line west of the city. That would free up the higher quality units to get trained over the winter-spring. That would mean not needing to continuously rotate brigades through Bakhmut because they're rendered in the meatgrinder so quickly. \n\nThe Ukrainians tried to have their cake and eat it too. They wanted to fight Bakhmut, allow a lot of their better units to at least be committed to fight there, nevermind the horrendous casualties they took. And they wanted to form a strong offensive ready reserve for the summer. They screwed up on both ends. \n\nBut NATO, especially the US Army, wasn't exactly doing them any favors. \n\n\\- For the combined arms training, the US Army should have had Security Force Assistance Brigades running it, who are actually subject matter experts at training foreign conventional troops. Units filled mostly with senior NCOs and captain to colonel officers meant to do the exact job that got assigned to the Army National Guard (speaking as a former Guardsman myself, training isn't their forte). \n\n\\- The SFAB should have been supported by parts of the 2-3 well-trained active duty armored BCTs that are already deployed to Europe, to provide subject matter expert assistance on mechanized operations. Not Army National Guardsman from an infantry brigade. \n\n\\- They should have had enough training units and space to ensure every UAF battalion planned to be used for the offensive would had the opportunity to conduct a 5 week training rotation. \n\n\\- They should have had embedded Ukrainian veterans, preferably junior field grade officers who are wounded heroes still recovering, to serve as liaisons to make sure whatever training NATO is giving Ukraine is reflective of what Ukraine is doing in combat. Don't just train them to fight, train them to fight how they are going to fight (a problem experienced routinely in WW2). \n\n\\- With the assistance of the UAF General Staff, standardize all the training so a Ukrainian soldier going to Sweden or the UK or Germany or Poland will all arrive in their unit with roughly the same knowledge, let alone skill as anyone else going to a different place. \n\nNone of these were done. The NATO training wasn't terrible, because without it they weren't getting any because the Ukrainians have decided training isn't something they're going to prioritize themselves.

                "body": "> I know bridge-layers exist but AFAIK those are mostly for water crossings, etc.\n\nActually quite the opposite. Armored vehicle-launched bridges (AVLBs) are specifically intended primarily to counter tank trap ditches, not for crossing bodies of water. Keep in mind that they are heavily armored, temporary bridges. Which means they are meant to be in place for a very short time, usually the amount of time it takes to complete a successful assault, and usually only in circumstances where there is a major risk of receiving enemy fire while maneuvering into place or holding there, hence the armor. Sometimes they might be used in situations where a narrow gap needs to be bridged on very short notice, e.g. if an armored column is proceeding through enemy territory after a breach and encounters a downed bridge. But in such cases, one of the primary objectives of the engineers will be to replace the AVLB with a pontoon bridge or something similar, because there are very limited supplies of AVLBs even in well-equipped armies (Ukraine apparently does not have anywhere near enough, so this pressure is even stronger on them), and so the AVLB is much more valuable remaining on the move with the column than sitting behind the lines where an unarmored, non-mobile solution would be equally effective.\n\nAlthough bridging water features is a legitimate use case for them, typically a random body of water is not necessarily under enemy fire control and therefore doesn't require an armored vehicle to bridge. So unless a defensive position happens to incorporate pre-existing water features, there just isn't the need for such an expensive solution to bridge a gap. If it's just a random river and not part of an established defensive position, there's no need for armor and likely a less temporary solution is desirable.\n\nMost bodies of water that are small enough for a bridge layer to cross are also small enough for tanks to just drive through, because generally natural water features do not have steep and deep enough banks to trap tanks, nor is the water so deep that a tank with properly maintained seals can't ford it. AVLBs have relatively short spans, with the maximum on the current US AVLB at something like 18m. Because they need to lay that down from a stable position at the upper bank of a water feature usually, that limits them to very narrow water features, where the water itself is likely substantially less than 18m across. Which means it's a pretty minor river or stream, and without truly unusual geography it is likely correspondingly shallow and fordable.\n\nTank ditches however are dug at a very specific width, neither so narrow that a tank can just drive over nor so wide that a tank can go all the way down into the ditch, where it would effectively just be hull down and protected and could then crawl up the far side with all of its tracks on the ground with full traction. The ditches have to be exactly the right width and depth such that a tank can get its nose stuck on the far side of the ditch while around 1/3 to 1/2 of its rear tracks are in the air without traction to push the tank over the far side of the ditch. Bridge layers are primarily designed to deal with that. A stream of comparable width would not have a sufficiently steep bank in most cases to stop a tank, although if it did a bridge layer could be used of course.",

But Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 has helped thaw those relations.\n\n\nThe White House has yet to announce the policy reversal or the assistance it will now provide, but it began notifying members of Congress on Tuesday, according to the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter.\n\nThe Pentagon press office did not respond to a request for comment. Adrienne Watson, a National Security Council spokeswoman, expressed a broader commitment to holding Russia to account for atrocities but declined to address the International Criminal Court issue.\n\u201cWe support a range of international investigations to identify and hold accountable those responsible,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cOn the I.C.C. specifically, we are not going to discuss the specifics on any cooperation, which is consistent with the court\u2019s practice of treating requests for cooperation in a confidential manner.\u201d\nJohn Bellinger, a former top lawyer at the National Security Council and State Department during the George W. Bush administration who favored sharing evidence with the court, embraced word of the decision.\n\u201cIt\u2019s too bad that they are not announcing that publicly, because it\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d he said.\n\nThe bipartisan legislation Congress enacted in December, embedded in a large appropriations bill, created an exception to prohibitions on funding and certain other aid to the court. It allows the government to assist with \u201cinvestigations and prosecutions of foreign nationals related to the situation in Ukraine, including to support victims and witnesses.\u201d\n\nDespite that signal of support, Pentagon leaders had continued to oppose such a step. They wanted to maintain the position taken by previous administrations: that the court should not exercise jurisdiction over citizens from a country that is not a party to the treaty that created it, like the United States or Russia.\n\nRegardless, the move is a significant step, as the government has been changing its approach toward the court.",

They point to a few odd wars where opponents had little to no effective air defenses or forces and suggest evidence of air dominance is how NATO plans to fight, which is ludicrous, because Air Supremacy/Dominance like in Desert Storm was NOT ever how WW3 was pictured or planned for, not even close. \n\nAir superiority simply means having control over the air in relation to your opponent. If neither side has it, its air parity. An edge enough to conduct effective air operations, air superiority. No real challenge, air supremacy/dominance. \n\nTo quote the USAF: *\"Air superiority was found to differ from \u00b7'air dominance\" over the entire battlespace at all times, which was found to be unachievable at an affordable cost.\"*\n\nAir superiority can be gained by degrading enemy air forces and air defenses, missions that NATO prioritizes far more than supporting ground operations (can't do the latter without severe losses until the former is accomplished). \n\nWhen viewing air support, its best viewed in what roles it can perform and what effects it can gain. \n\nAerial Reconnaissance: The original role of aircraft in war, seeing the enemy front lines from a higher angle and even better yet, having the chance to go beyond the front lines to see further. A role almost entirely taken in the modern age over by various types of unmanned ISR drones and satellites. \n\nAir Defense: Besides using ground based air defenses, aircraft can also be used for this role, hence the Interceptor type of aircraft, designed to target enemy bombers in particular. However, as mentioned, this role is duplicated to not a small degree when ground based air defenses are strong enough, such as Ukraine in this war. \n\nStrategic Bombing: When discussing Air Power, capitalized, it refers to an ideology that started in the 1920s that capitalized on the premise that armies and navies weren't needed, only air forces were. Bombers to strike the enemy's heartland to cause them to capitulate, and fighters to protect friendly skies from enemy bombers. That's morphed over the years greatly, and much of the non-nuclear strategic bombing role is carried out by long range missiles. In Ukraine, they're using long range missiles and drones to strike Russian strategic targets, but not effectively. More so, they're not going to gain better capabilities because NATO doesn't want them doing it because of fear of escalation. \n\nDeep Air Support/Air Interdiction: Flying the skies behind enemy lines in their tactical and operational rear, going after softer targets and more critical ones like HQ/C2, supply depots, communication nodes, bridges, railroads, and basically anything moving of military value (especially supply convoys or combat units conducting road marches). This is the preferred way that most air forces want to provide tactical air support, especially the USAF. \n\nOne, it is quite effective at hitting more important targets. CAS destroys enemy tanks or infantry squads, air interdiction destroys enemy tactical units at a higher level and can even decapitate operational level commands. Two, it gives air forces more freedom and autonomy, they can roam the skies and find targets and plan operations themselves, they're not just acting as a bomb truck deliveryman for some Army lieutenant who will guide them on an IP right through enemy air defenses to get shot down while trying to bomb a sniper. \n\nI can't stress this enough, in every NATO military with a powerful air force, especially the USAF, there is a major rivalry and culture where air forces don't want to become subordinate to ground operations. If it happens, its often seen as a failure to a large degree, especially by the Air Power ideologues in the service.   \n\nIn the modern age, a lot of the fires effects done by a strong air interdiction campaign can be replicated by long range PGM rockets, missiles, and drones, as they're being done in Ukraine. Those typically wont have the same HE payload as what a fixed wing strike aircraft can deliver. Nor the ability to go after large groupings of moving targets (though Ukraine TB-2 were able to do just that early in the war). But with good intel, a quick kill chain, and enough PGMs (like the 10k+ GMLRS Ukraine fired already), the Ukrainians can do it without manned fixed wing air support. More so, they can do it cheaper, safer, and without the need to try to turn the Ukrainian Air Force into the US Air Force, which isn't happening even if they are given a full wing of F-16s.",

While it does provide an advantage there are multiple examples in the last 100 years of countries with superior troop experience at the onset of a war losing to those who were deficient in experience but superior in training. Battle hardening has advantages at the lower tactical levels but you can often learn bad habits from it that may work but are not the optimal approach. I would rather have American troops with an actual trained NCO corp than syrians with no NCO corp because the inefficiency of their habits they learned from being battle hardened are going to create all kinds of problems. Sure, the Americans may not have actually experienced being shot at but they've their troops to handle things at the lowest level. Attacks would be more synchronized because the Americans have trained hundreds of times for this. Officers are free to make decisions instead of micromanaging enlisted because of superior NCO training. At the company to battalion level officers have been trained to take the initiative allowing them to seize crucial opportunities that might be missed otherwise because they were not trained to take the initiative. At the brigade level officers and their staff have been through multiple exercises giving them experience in coordinating the hectic experience of combined arms.\n\nThis is not to say I believe American doctrine is beyond reproach. Our doctrine takes air superiority for granted and we base almost everything off of this with our backups/alternatives in case we cannot attain air superiority *cough cough* artillery *cough* being supbar. I believe this war is making America and NATO reconsider this. I had the pleasure of listening to a podcast with US Gen. James Hecker and RAF Air Marshal Johnny Stringer.

At least not until the southern offensive succeeded or failed. It would require too many resources to successfully exploit a breakthrough there, and the strategic objectives achievable with that breakthrough are not really worth it at the moment. At least not when there's a possibility they can still breakthrough in the south and use the same reserves to exploit that breakthrough. A Bakhmut breakthrough would primarily enable an attack to retake the LNR, whether by attacking north to retake Soledar and then potentially Popasna and Lysychansk/Severodonetsk, or to push due east to wedge the LNR and DNR apart. Any of those objectives is less important to both the Russians and Ukrainians than Crimea is.\n\nSo I would suggest that the 21st being in the Bakhmut area doesn't mean they were slated for an immediate offensive there. Likely they were allocated as a reserve to the central section of the frontlines stretching from Donetsk in the south to Kreminna in the north, and are now being committed at the northern end of that area of operations to defend against the Russian offensive.\n\nThat said, the Russian offensive is clearly a fixing action designed to draw resources away from the south. [Judging from reports today that the Ukrainians have finally openly committed to a full offensive in the south](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/07/27/world/russia-ukraine-news), it does not seem that the units devoted to defense in the north are undermining their offensive actions in the south, where they still retain substantial uncommitted reserves slotted for the offensive.",

But let's remember that up to that point the Ukrainians failed in the slightest to exploit the bridgehead on the Inhulets that they had retained in Lozove since the clashes in June. The Russians even managed to counterattack and recover some ground along the Dnipro and made Snihurivka a new stronghold on the Inhulets. The craziest thing, however, was the holding of the lines in and around the Blahodatne area along the road to Mykolaiv. Yes, the Ukrainians did not push there the way they did in the northern sector and along the Inhulets, but the Russians managed to hold the same positions they controlled in May even the week before the withdrawal from Kherson. \n\nIn the end the campaign was won mainly by screwing the Russian logistics and their depots with GMLRS and their equipment with Excaliburs which convinced them to withdraw, along with their losses they were taking just to postpone the inevitable. I think, paradoxically, it was convenient for Ukraine to have so many Russians stuck in the wrong bank of the Dnipro and with no possibility of advancing, while for Russia holding that area once it was clear that Odesa was going to remain a dream made no sense.

            "body": "The attacks near Orikhiv today involved three battalions and were reportedly successful, which happened after they recorded that episode of WOTR. Which may have alleviated some of Kofman's gloominess had it happened a day earlier. In any case, it does seem the Ukrainians are learning to operate in larger units and possibly how to overcome Russian minefields.\n\nKofman can be a little pessimistic sometimes. I think because he often underestimates the Ukrainians, strangely enough for someone who is generally pro-Ukrainian. For example, he assumes it would have been better to give vets the new equipment because the initial counteroffensive did not go as well as he wanted it to. But it's a pointless counterfactual, because we have no way of knowing that the Ukrainians wouldn't have suffered a complete collapse if they had pulled more veteran soldiers off the lines over the winter. We don't know how close things were, and we won't for a long time. Nor is it reasonable to Monday morning quarterback the Ukrainian risk assessment there. They may have considered the possibility of a defensive loss a much greater magnitude of harm than the possibility of the offensives failing. So even with a smaller probability of a collapse happening, the expected risk may have been greater for pulling veterans off the line (Probability x Magnitude of Harm = Risk). I think Kofman should probably give a little more respect to the Ukrainian general staff here, because unlike him they clearly took into account the dangers of pulling too many of their best soldiers off the lines during the Russian winter offensive.\n\nKofman also reads way too much into the units around Bakhmut being more successful than those in the south. It's a completely invalid comparison. The terrain is different. The Bakhmut region is substantially less well fortified on the Russian side because their gains came so recently. The Russian units deployed there are either much lower quality or much more heavily attrited than those in the south, or both. And the Russians know that the Ukrainians don't actually want to push along the Bakhmut axis and so are resourcing their defense there with the least amount they can get away with to support the spoiling attack in the north and the defense in the south. Whereas the units along the Zaporizhzhia line are facing the most extensive fortifications of any sector along the front and the relatively well-rested (and until recently well-led) 58th Combined Arms Army. Of course the units attacking in the south are having a harder time. That doesn't indicate that the units around Bakhmut would have done any better.\n\nThe new Ukrainian offensive corps had very little time to train on their vehicles, and very little of the overall training regimen involved any battalion or above coordinated maneuvers. It is then also somewhat unsurprising that they have been struggling with larger unit coordination and complex combined arms assaults during the early days of this offensive. However, the units around Bakhmut have never had such training and do not have any field experience with anything above the battalion level, and precious little at that level. Is it possible that when trained in the west veterans would have been more able to absorb some of those lessons, however brief they might have been? Maybe, but I would expect them to have many of the same problems as the soldiers who actually did train in the west, because the problems are problems inherent to their operational plan itself, which presumably would not have changed significantly, rather than how the individual units executed the orders particularly. Specifically:\n\n- they weren't ready for the effects of electronic warfare,\n- they lacked sufficient de-mining capabilities,\n- they lacked SHORAD to counter Russian attack helicopters, and\n- they have just barely managed to eke out an edge in artillery fires over the past couple of weeks.\n\nNo amount of experience at the tactical level could overcome those problems, although likely the losses would have been marginally lower. Either way, I think the result would have been what it was: the Ukrainians took an operational pause to rethink their approach and are now trying different tactics. Which means they are displaying a capacity to learn and adapt. Whether they are able to sustain that pattern and translate it into meaningful battlefield results remains to be seen.\n\nI wouldn't worry about it too much unless their difficulties persist past mid-September, at which point they will have had three months of training plus three months of field experience. US tankers train for six months, for comparison. Although that's apples to oranges, because training an entire unit from scratch is almost certainly much more complicated than slotting a newly trained soldier into an existing unit. But six months is enough time for each brigade to get in a few operations with enough adaptation cycles to get a sense of whether they have the fundamental ability to improve and to sustain those improvements under these conditions.\n\nBecause that's really what we should be looking for at this point. Not the Ukrainians achieving any specific breakthrough or objective, but rather the Ukrainians adapting their tactics and learning lessons from their experiences so far without sacrificing too many of their resources. They need to be innovating and adapting rather than blindly persistent, finding a way around obstacles instead of slamming their faces into them. Reports that they used remote-controlled BMPs as part of the assault near Orikhiv today would be an excellent example of such adaptation. If they continue to avoid major losses like they suffered during the first few days of the offensive while pursuing promising new approaches like that, they have plenty of time and resources left to develop their operational capacity.\n\nUltimately, I think we need to stop expecting Ukraine to fight like the US would. Most NATO countries can't fight like the US does. Neither Kharkiv nor Kherson offensives looked anything like something out of US or NATO doctrine. Yet they were extremely successful in achieving their strategic objectives.\n\nAnd Ukraine still lacks many of the critical capabilities that are essential to US/NATO doctrine. Not least of all air superiority and long range precision fires. But also close air support, AWACS, electronic warfare capabilities, air mobility, aerial resupply, a tooth-to-tail ratio that asymptotically approaches zero, amphibious assault capabilities, universally available NVGs, near-universally available satellite comms, etc.. They don't even have a navy really, and can you imagine any NATO operation without at least a few Tomahawks or carrier-launched aircraft in the mix? Even if those capabilities don't seem particularly important to the specific operation in front of us, they represent a wide range of options for holding Russian assets at risk and disrupting Russian operations which would help degrade Russia's overall capabilities in ways Ukraine could only hope for. US and NATO doctrines tacitly assume the existence of these capabilities when planning for breaching assaults on fortified positions. \n\nYet Ukraine has none of those capabilities. Instead, they have a dizzying array of different, often incompatible systems and vehicles of all vintages and origins, and an army that has had too little time to train on making that hodgepodge work as a unified whole. No one could possibly have created a doctrine in advance for a situation as bizarre as the one the Ukrainians find themselves in, so they are inventing their doctrine as they go. \n\nGive them time. And let's all stop talking as if support will dry up the second Ukraine runs into trouble or at midnight on December 31st or whatever arbitrary deadline you want to pick from thin air. Because that's just giving in to Russia. Remember Timothy Snyder's first lesson on fighting tyranny, [\"Do not obey in advance.\"](https://scholars.org/contribution/twenty-lessons-fighting-tyranny-twentieth-century) Russia and its friends keep talking about this offensive as if western support will completely disappear overnight if the Ukrainians don't win and win big. Don't let Russia set the stakes and don't let them control the narrative about western support. No matter the outcomes at the end of this year or at the end of this war even, Ukraine will still require enormous support from the west, not only to rebuild but to re-equip and retrain them with a force capable of serving as a credible deterrent to future Russian aggression. It takes logistical pipelines to sustain militaries, not one time gifts. Everyone should get used to the idea that we're in this for the long haul, because there really isn't any other way that doesn't end us back in the exact same position as we are now a few years down the road.",

That plus massing a major effort involving quality units and supposedly lots of artillery.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not sure how much ground they have taken, but if entire UAF brigades from the reserve did get committed there and not just a battalion here and there then they bit hard.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/26/world/europe/ukraine-russia-offensive-northeast.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/26/world/europe/ukraine-russia-offensive-northeast.html</a></p>\n\n<p>The report about counterattacking to reclaim lost territory is the most troublesome, because that means they bit to the point they aren&#39;t just committing forces and supplies to stem the flow or even totally stop it, but to retake the lost ground. That to me is a bit of an overreaction, since retaking lost ground in Luhansk doesn&#39;t at all help support the strategic main effort. Stopping them from reaching the Oskil is pretty important, but not getting east of the Zherebets River. That can wait.

China can put an eyewatering amount of missles into the air. I'd say it's their most valuable and most powerful asset. Either just on tiawan, or if they fear the US will become involved include US assets in the region as well.  Which it seems like the US would get involved. So,  let's hit the US too. Well, that will include firing on US assets in S Korea and Japan. There is 0% chance of no collateral damage to those nations. So they join too. Also,  that's a nato article 5 activation. While nato outside the US doesn't have massive expeditionary power projection. They have some, and they also have massive economic and production assets to help the US.

If true, this seems on the face of it like a terrible idea.

In either case, they likely proceed by proofing a new lane starting from somewhere just behind the lost vehicle, which isn't such a big deal if the vehicles are disposable. If each gets them a few meters closer to having a fully proofed lane to their objective, that may make sense if they have sufficient supplies of the RC BMPs. The scale of the BMP losses is telling. I don't think there have ever been so many armored vehicle losses reported for any single Ukrainian operation. They usually retreat before they take such heavy losses. The Ukrainians are very sensitive to personnel losses, in part because of their own culture and values but also because they know their western partners won't support a strategy premised on human attrition. Yet in this case, they incurred those losses and still persisted with the assault for long enough to breach the lines and penetrate 2.5km, where they eventually *did* retreat after losing a much smaller number of Bradleys, which is in line with their historical pattern of loss sensitivity unlike the BMP losses.",

            "body": "I don't think anyone that knows too much about Russia's massive air attack on the Kiev based Patriot system is able to talk about it but the gist of it is as follows: \n\n1. Kinzhal missiles may be hypersonic but they are apparently not very maneuverable which means while fast, a Kinzhal's trajectory can be calculated reliably. \n\n2. Hypersonic missiles are a problem for air defense because the missiles anti air systems launch are slower than a hypersonic - if the Kinzhal is \"past\" the air defense system, the missiles launched by the air defense system will never catch up to the Kinzhal.\n\n3. In the case of the attack on Kiev, the Kinzhals were more or less coming straight for the Patriot system which basically negates the hypersonic speed advantage - the Patriot could calculate the trajectory and put a missile in between the Kinzhal and the system - essentially a straight shot.\n\nThat is my best understanding.

If you doubt those reports, [further evidence for the claim is Russia arresting and purging some of the scientists responsible for the program.]( https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-hypersonic-missile-scientists-arrested-treason-patriots-ukraine-rcna84857)\n\n>If yes, then what impact does it have to Ukraine war effort? \n\nLittle to none. It's mostly a PR victory for Ukraine that shows what a paper tiger Russia is, with many of their newest and most hyped systems not performing as advertised. The number of Kinzhals available was always too small to tip the balance in Russia's favor even were they capable of hypersonic maneuverability, and Russia has not been using them against targets that require such a theoretically advanced system to strike. \n\nTo the extent that there is an impact, the presence of Kinzhals in Russia's arsenal motivates Kyiv to keep their PATRIOT batteries in rear areas protecting high value targets that might be subject to Kinzhal strikes. However, that motivation already exists in that there are very limited numbers of PATRIOTs available and they are one of the few systems that can be used to defend against traditional ballistic missiles like Iskanders, so forward deployment to cover the battlefield was likely never in the cards as long as Russia continues to use its long range missile systems to attempt to inflict attrition on Ukrainian civilian targets and infrastructure.",

Others were too small by choice (Poland, Taiwan). Ukraine population is 8x Finland's population so a back of the envelope calculation indicates that Ukraine could have whatever Finland has times 8. I was a bit blurred about the actual numbers and had to recheck. Finnish Army has about 18,500 active service and another 18,500 reservists in refresher training at all times. In war time formation, they are up to 180,000. In total scrape the barrel mode, 900,000. \n\nTheir wartime org consists of 3 readiness brigades (BDEs) (1 armoured), 2 Jaeger BDEs, 2 mechanised BDEs in the operative army. In their territorials, there are 6 infantry BDEs and 5 infantry BDEs equi. in independent battalions and another 3 BDEs. equi. in company-sized units. \n\nSo Ukraine, in the same mobilisation scheme, should get 296,000 ready at any point, 1.4 millions in wartime strength, and 7.2 millions scrape the barrels. At the bare minimum, they should outnumber 2:1 with just the ready force and nearly 10x numerical superiority with wartime strength.\n\nI've been familiarized with Finnish doctrine because I play hobbyist wargames/map exercises of Finnish v. Russian forces. Doctrinally, a Finnish unit, eg. a Jaeger company is expected to stop a Russian motor-rifle battalion. The Finnish Army is the only army in NATO with the same ratio of artillery to line in their brigades as the Russian brigades and the Finnish platoons and companies are much larger than a Russian equivalence. The scheme is \"deterrence by punishment\": telling the invaders that they can invade and breach the borders but they will pay a heavy price. The army can slow down the invaders and buy time for the civilians to be evacuated. Tactically, how a Finnish squad plans to stop a motor-rifle platoon is by using the fact that they are in a defensive position, every rifleman in a squad has an M72 LAW, which will go through the front of a BMP and the side of all Russian tanks without ERA, and each BMP in a three vehicle platoon will be fired at by at least 2 LAWs. Conscription is short and can be as short as 6 months, which is just about enough to teach a conscript to do just that: shoot a disposable rocket in a plastic tube.\n\nThe deterrence scheme you think of is deterrence by denial. It's placing 3 brigades in Europe and a battalion in the Baltics. It's trying to defend every inch of the border from forward deployed forces. It is also, militarily backwards. It is Frederick the Great's \"he who defends every mile defends nothing\". It's Poland looking at its alliance with Britain and France hoping to deter the Germans in 1939.
