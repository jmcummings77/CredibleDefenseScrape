As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

We don't know how many Storm Shadows the Ukrainians have. We don't know how many they are getting. We also don't know how many are British in origin. It is very possible that there could be dozens available to them.\n\n2. This is about moving the Overton Window within NATO political circles. It is the next step on the escalation ladder and *must* be done if Ukraine is to have a chance to win. They *must* strike Russian military infrastructure inside Russia and their means to do that are limited in payload currently. If the Ukrainians are provided the means to strike into Russia, and then do, the potential damage that can be inflicted is absolutely immense.

Can they mobilize and throw even more troops at the meatgrinder? I know they've started hitting power generation recently. Can they intensify that campaign? What are their options in this scenario?\n\nAnother round of full mobilization, not just the regular supply of volunteers, would be extremely damaging to Ukraine. As it currently stands Ukraine is playing catch-up with their own semi-neutered mobilization reform. It remains to be seen how successful that is, but they're already significantly delayed in these efforts and the impact of this is already being felt at the front line. \n\nLuckily Russia is in a position where it doesn't currently \\*need\\* to mobilize and so despite winning the election and essentially securing the political sphere, Russia has not yet mobilized. Forcing their hand in this regard by putting a hard clock on the war might cause significant tactical success for Ukraine in the immediate short term, but this is potentially one of those monkey's paw moments. \n\nIt would certainly cost Russia greatly to mobilize, equip, train and then deploy these new soldiers into front line positions, both from a material and losses perspective, but this would be occurring at a time when Ukraine is already stretched and has delayed mobilization and construction of its own fall back lines and positions, it's going to be a while before these processes bear any fruit for Ukraine and stabilize things so forcing Russia to pick up the pace and trade more disproportionately to end the war might be a mistake. Russia has already demonstrated a willingness to trade at very unfavourable ratios, encouraging them to do so at an even higher scale will have consequences. Russian losses will be high, but Ukraine will be under immense pressure.\n\nAs for electrical generation, they've destroyed most of the TPP's completely now, with Burshtyn getting a finishing strike a week ago. If any generating capacity remains in Ukraine from TPP sources (in any sizeable quantity) they're going to be tightlipped about it. Regardless for all intents and purposes Ukraine's TPP infrastructure is in ruins and they are now wholly reliant on HPP (Hydro) which is very limited and also demonstrably vulnerable, PSH (Pumped Hydro Storage) which has the same issues and relies on excess generating capacity which is now no longer in excess and Nuclear.\n\nNuclear is the only secure generating means that Ukraine continues to posses in any meaningful capacity, the lines and substations however are very vulnerable. Russia has been very restrained in terms of crossing that line and they would certainly receive widespread admonishment for executing risky strikes against the substations, but if the war intensifies further and high value assets get wiped out inside Russia proper in very large quantities, I foresee Russia as being willing to play the risk/reward game and cut those lines. \n\nIn that situation Ukraine will lose essentially all of its remaining generating capacity, replacing the substations will be incredibly costly and time intensive and this does not rule out the opportunity for Russia to simply strike them again. In the meantime Ukraine would be wholly reliant on the pitiful amount of HPP capacity it has remaining along with a handful of small capacity renewable projects and European imports. None of which will come close to powering a country the size of Ukraine. Permanent and rolling blackouts in everything but the far West of the country. \n\nIn my opinion Ukraine's best bet is to hunker down for the next year and focus on mobilizing and replenishing their forces, this would be easier if they hadn't stalled, but forcing Russia's hand with a large escalation might initially solve problems at the front line and deliver large tactical and PR victories, but the consequence of this could be quickening the pace of the war at a time when Ukraine needs to coast its way into 2025/2026 when Western support really starts to pick up. \n\nAs for tactical nuke, I just see that as extremely (with an emphasis on that) unlikely.",

Now, actually enforcing sanctions meaningfully would be painful; which is why it was avoided, but it is also another avenue that is much cheaper than extending this into the future of black swan events.\n\nNow in terms of actual military aid, the Ramstein group sent/pledged about 0,25% of their combined GDP so far. So around $120 billion in military aid; does that sound a lot to you? That's peanuts for the economies involved, we could've sent $500 billion by now EASILY. \n\n>I think the exact opposite is true. How can one argue that we are serious about helping Ukraine while placing all kinds of restrictions on them?\n\nNo, the argument is that we are presumably following the escalation ladder in a meaningful way so as to not make Russia do something drastic(not necessarily just nukes, but say actual war declaration, full mobilization, ramping up of hybrid attacks, etc etc.) \n\nHow does it make sense to skip steps? If after Ukraine has been armed to the teeth and it's still having issues, then talk about doing deep strikes within Russia with western armaments. \n\nIf the logic here is that we shouldn't follow the escalation ladder, then that's another thing completely. In that case, why hasn't NATO intervened in 2008, 2014, 2022; or now already? Every delay is going to be more costly as time goes on. \n\nAgain, to reiterate; west hasn't exhausted its options when it comes to diplomatic/political/economic domains; and while those are now less effective after Russia has had 2 years to prepare they're still on the table.

Now, actually enforcing sanctions meaningfully would be painful; which is why it was avoided, but it is also another avenue that is much cheaper than extending this into the future of black swan events.</p>\n\n<p>Now in terms of actual military aid, the Ramstein group sent/pledged about 0,25% of their combined GDP so far. So around $120 billion in military aid; does that sound a lot to you? That&#39;s peanuts for the economies involved, we could&#39;ve sent $500 billion by now EASILY. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think the exact opposite is true. How can one argue that we are serious about helping Ukraine while placing all kinds of restrictions on them?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>No, the argument is that we are presumably following the escalation ladder in a meaningful way so as to not make Russia do something drastic(not necessarily just nukes, but say actual war declaration, full mobilization, ramping up of hybrid attacks, etc etc.) </p>\n\n<p>How does it make sense to skip steps? If after Ukraine has been armed to the teeth and it&#39;s still having issues, then talk about doing deep strikes within Russia with western armaments. </p>\n\n<p>If the logic here is that we shouldn&#39;t follow the escalation ladder, then that&#39;s another thing completely. In that case, why hasn&#39;t NATO intervened in 2008, 2014, 2022; or now already? Every delay is going to be more costly as time goes on. </p>\n\n<p>Again, to reiterate; west hasn&#39;t exhausted its options when it comes to diplomatic/political/economic domains; and while those are now less effective after Russia has had 2 years to prepare they&#39;re still on the table. There&#39;s been no prominent attempts at hybrid war from the west either.</p>\n</div>",

Anyone with a knife and nothing to lose can kill people if needed\n\nThis is not an accurate assessment when you move beyond individual terrorists to terrorist organizations that expect to control their own territory and threaten their foes. Hamas is dangerous because they have access to rockets, explosives, and vast quantities of small arms. A Hamas armed with knives is not a threat. You think a bunch of dudes with knives could have done the Oct 7th massacre?\n\n> I'm just going to say that with zero priors if I'm occupied by foreigners I'm going to be Not Impressed regardless of how positive my textbooks are\n\nFirst: Japan provides a great counterexample, becoming one of the US' strongest allies during and after occupation. Second: Palestinians haven't exactly been happy even with nominal control of one of their borders, and it certainly didn't keep Hamas and their \"civilian\" friends from attacking on Oct 7th.\n\n> I guess my question is, I accept that in the short time that's a good idea; and then what? What would Palestinian statehood actually look like after that? Permanently disarmed? Which free country would actually agree to that?\n\nHilarious strawman. You admit it's a good idea in the short term. Nowhere in the proposal is a statement that it should be made permanent - that's just something you made up. So it's just a good idea. A Palestine that has reformed under a reasonable government that isn't all in on killing all jewish people would certainly be allowed to establish armed police forces, and maybe even a self-defense force or small military. Disarming defeated opponents is not some shocking overreach or an implication of a future with no military ever allowed again. Again, see the fate of the Axis powers post-WW2 to understand both the benefits and the temporary nature of disarmament. Also there are actually a decent number of countries that (willingly) do not maintain any armed forces - mostly islands and/or small countries like Liechtenstein that only have small professional police forces and maybe a Coast Guard.\n\n> I don't see Israel ever voluntarily giving up that control once they have it. I mean again; look at the West bank. Checkpoints everywhere, settlements crisscrossing the land, etc. You think they're just gonna leave?\n\nI mean... Yeah, that's exactly what I think. They've done it before, it's not like they haven't fully occupied Gaza in the past, and they left willingly in 2005. We have literal empirical evidence from relatively recent history demonstrating Israel's willingness to give up complete control of Gaza's border with Egypt. So I very much do think that \"they're just gonna leave\" if they feel like Gaza isn't going to immediately turn back into a Hamas/militant staging ground or otherwise achieve what they consider to be a successful outcome.",
