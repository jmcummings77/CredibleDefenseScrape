And the question is: did anyone try to stop the enemy on Chongar? The impression of what was happening was completely different . On Sunday, February 13, at 8:00 p.m., the command staff of the 59th motorized infantry brigade was called to a meeting with General Sokolov. The brigade was at the Shiroky Lan training ground at that time. The task was to immediately move to the training ground near Oleshky, Kherson region. Next In the afternoon, we arrived near Oleshki and started setting up the field camp.\r  \n\r  \nWe read the news that an attack was possible, but in reality no defense preparations were made at all. Judge for yourself whether we had a chance to stop the enemy.\r  \n\r  \nFirst, the entire brigade artillery - two divisions, our main means of defeat - was sent for training in the Kyiv region, and they did not return to us until the beginning of the invasion.\r\r  \nSecondly, our anti-tank division, the main means of combating tanks, was sent for training near Kyiv and did not return until the invasion.\r\r  \nThirdly, the engineering support group of the brigade - that is, the sappers who were supposed to lay minefields and blow up bridges - were sent for training in Kamianets-Podilskyi and did not return before the invasion.\r  \n\rFourth, the anti-aircraft artillery division of the brigade did not have any missile systems to combat enemy aircraft.\r\r  \nFifth, the entire aerial reconnaissance platoon of the brigade with all drones was in Donbas and was assigned to another brigade, and the 59th brigade did not have the opportunity to conduct reconnaissance and adjust fire.\r  \n\rSixth, the brigade was not replenished with an operational reserve, and our three infantry battalions had 50-60% of the required number of men.\r  \n\rSeventh, the brigade was not deployed on the lines of Chongar cover and did not equip any combat positions for defense.\r  \n\rEighthly, the brigades defined a zone of responsibility of 139 km, which we did not even have time to study. The 9th battalion - about 300 people - was sent from Oleshki to the Melitopol area, but it also did not have time to deploy or build at least some kind of border.\r  \n\rNinthly, the brigade did not receive any information about the enemy. Every evening, the brigade received an intelligence report with approximately the following text: \"There is currently no threat of the enemy going on the offensive.\" And that's it, no warnings.\r  \n\rTenth, and this is really the most important thing, there was no plan for the defense of Chongar, as well as numerous bridges and dams from Chongar to Kherson, to Kakhovka, to Melitopol, to Energodar. More precisely, I assume that somewhere in the headquarters there were some pieces of paper, but the troops could not fulfill it, since the orders to deploy at the borders and equip the positions did not arrive.\r  \n\r  \nAnd what happened?\r  \n\r  \nAbout a thousand people lived for 9 days at the training ground in Oleshki in winter in tarpaulin tents and were engaged in household issues and self-sufficiency.\r  \n\rIn the evening there were long meetings of the command staff devoted to administrative matters.\r  \n\rThere was simply no time for combat training.\r  \n\rIt was forbidden to dig positions on Chongar, because there is private land, farmers do not allow it, and in the absence of martial law, we did not have the right to dig trenches ourselves.\r  \n\r  \nNo one prepared numerous bridges and dams for detonation.\r  \n\rThe security around the bridges was not deployed, there was no one on the bridges and dams, the rear was completely empty, no territorial defense was deployed.\r  \n\rIt was absurd - everyone is talking about war on the Internet, but nothing is being done in the army. The south was not prepared for defense, the brigade was not given the opportunity to defend Chongar.\r  \n\rIn front of us stood the 137th Airborne Assault Battalion, which had 50% of its personnel, and some of them were completely untrained conscripts, this unit actually performed surveillance functions on a front 150 km away, that is, they could defend themselves only symbolically. And we could not help the 137th battalion in any way, because the 59th brigade was not deployed on the enemy's offensive paths, we lived in Oleshki.\r  \n\r  \nCommand and staff exercises were planned for February 24, but the troops remained in the camp.\r\r  \nCould the 59th brigade stop the enemy? I agree with Sokolov that the military is not primarily to blame here. If martial law had been declared in advance, if we had been replenished with an operational reserve, the bridges had been taken under the protection of territorial defense troops, an order had been issued to defend Chongar, if they had given at least some anti-aircraft missile systems and all our artillery, we would not have given the Russians in one day drive almost without resistance up to 150 km and drive to Kherson, Kakhovka, and Melitopol. The enemy would suffer significant losses. In fact, the terrain on Chongar is very conducive to defense, there are a significant number of bridges and dams.\r  \n\r  \nAnd so, in fact, the 59th brigade, without even having time to meet the enemy, was immediately surrounded and did not defend itself on advantageous prepared lines, but broke through, and was forced to save itself.\r  \n\r  \nAfter the air and artillery strikes of the Russians, the brigade began to assemble in alarm, to prepare for movement.\r  \n\rAround 8:00 a.m., the brigade headquarters received information from the special services that the Russians were preparing a helicopter landing on the Antoniv bridge in our rear to surround the brigade. Obviously, all other structures of the defense forces should have received the same information.\r  \n\rBut at 11:30 a.m., the Russian helicopter landing force captured the Antoniv bridge without any obstacles, which did not have even rudimentary security, and there was no anti-aircraft defense. The Antoniv bridge and the bridge at the Kakhovskaya HPP were of strategic importance. If they were blown up, the enemy would not be able to advance on the right-bank Ukraine, and the bridge would have to be destroyed.\r  \n\rBut that didn't happen either. As a result, scattered units of the 59th brigade and the 137th battalion did not even have the opportunity to mount an organized resistance, we were simply not given such an opportunity. And we fought our way through the city captured by the enemy, with significant losses, and the Russian columns reached the bridges over the Dnieper in a few hours almost unimpeded. Enemy airplanes and helicopters flew above us constantly and unhindered. Our heroic attack aircraft also flew twice.\r  \n\rIt must be said honestly: control of the troops on the left bank was lost almost immediately after the start of the invasion. Chaos, everyone gets out as they can.\r  \n\rA significant number of military personnel remained in the territory occupied by the enemy and came to us for a long time, up to two months, we had to abandon a lot of equipment and weapons.\r  \n\rThe fighting started only in Kherson, although there was no preparation there either. Using the undamaged bridges, the enemy quickly transferred forces to the right bank and on the fourth day of the war completely captured Kherson, Energodar, Tokmak, Melitopol, and Berdyansk. Practically with minimal resistance from our side.\r\r  \nIf defenses were really being built in the south, would there be such an attitude and such an organization, do you think?\"",

                        "body": "I've been reading through Charles J. Dick's \"From Victory to Stalemate: The Western Front, Summer 1944\" in order to get a better understanding of what happened at Falaise. I thought the majority of German troops from Normandy were encircled there, but it turns out it was only 100,000. The rest, 150,000+ (couldn't find an exact number), were outside of the Falaise Pocket.\n\nThe original plan after Operation Cobra was to cut the 5th & 7th German armies off at the River Seine, and then to liquidate them using the Seine as a geographic wall. This plan was concocted under the assumption that the Germans would try to retreat straight to and past the Seine. \n\nHowever, Hitler, in his typical deluded fashion, decided to launch a counterattack (Operation Luttich), in order to plug the breakthrough and to roll up the Allied front around the village of Avaranches. Luttich failed miserably. But this concentration of German forces caused Bradley to wheel away from the original plan to cut off German forces at the Seine, and to try and cut off this concentration of German troops off via a much shorter encirclement. AKA: The Falaise Pocket\n\nThe new plan was for the Canadian 1st Army & US 3rd Army to form a pincer movement around some 100,000 German troops, and close the pocket at a town alled Argentan, 25 miles south of the town of Falaise. However, the northern drive, under the Canadian 1st Army, ran into severe German resistance around Falaise. And with Montgomery not wanting to commit significant reinforcements, the advance slowed to a halt. Meanwhile in the south, Patton's 3rd Army made it to Argentan, but was stopped from meeting up with the Canadians by Bradley, who redeployed Patton to the River Seine. These events led to a 25 mile gap remaining open between the Allied pincers for a week, allowing 50,000 German troops to escape. \n\nFurther east, Patton's 3rd Army raced towards the River Seine, encountering almost no resistance, and seizing several bridgehead across the river. By now, thousands of German troops had crossed the River Seine, partially due to the delay that Operation Luttich had caused for the Allies. It was here that Patton argued for a northern thrust to the town of Beavus, cutting off German troops which had already escaped across the River Seine. These German troops were quite weak, having lost most of their heavy equipment, and with no thorough entrenchments to immediately fall back on. But Bradley ordered Patton to continue east to Paris. His thinking was that making sweeping advances and taking German territory was more important than destroying their armies. \n\nAll in all, the Germans managed to evacuate some 240,000 troops across the River Seine, along with whatever equipment had survived. \n\nMy intent here is to provide some context to my conclusion. Yes, you are right in pointing out that the German units in the Falaise Pocket were mauled, and Army Group B as a whole was smashed severely during the Battle for Normandy. I mean, the numbers almost speak for themselves. Of the some 2,300 tanks, tank destroyers, and assault guns sent to Normandy, around 1,500 were lost from June-August of 1944. Out of the 600,000 German troops which fought in The Battle for Normandy & in support of it, some 200,000 became casualties, with around 80,000 being killed or captured. The 5th & 7th Armies came exceedingly close to being annihilated. \n\nHowever, due to Allied mistakes, mainly at the generalship-level, such as committing to 2 encirclements at once, or driving East to capture more territory instead of focusing on the destruction of the German Armies, much of the 5th & 7th armies remained intact. \n\nI'm pretty much parroting from CJ Dick here, but out of the 1 army, 7 corps, and 20 divisional HQ's trapped in the Falaise Pocket (he only mentions the word \"pocket\", so I assume he means the Falaise Pocket), only 1 corps and 3 division HQ's were lost. These valuable elements of the remnants of Army Group B helped \"ensured that there would be experienced, efficient brains to direct the refitted formations and the new bodies that would be created, and some logistic and administrative structures to keep them going.\"\n\nAgain, quoting CJ Dicks \"From Victory to Stalemate: The Western Front, Summer 1944\", \"more than a dozen divisions that had escaped the Normandy envelopments, albeit much the worse for wear, contributed to the checking of the Allied advance in September. Two of them, 9 and 10 SS Panzer Divisions of II SS Panzer Corps, would, a mere four weeks after evading destruction at Falaise, ensure the defeat of Operation Market Garden, Montgomery\u2019s attempt at a knockout blow...The HQs that escaped the partial encirclements in August provided the command and staff expertise necessary to rebuild formations, and fourteen of the surviving divisions (eight of them panzer) were reconstituted and provided most of the combat power for the Germans\u2019 Ardennes offensive in December.\"",

Work from 2014.](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA594372.pdf) Diving right in the vessel which was from day 1 already trying to stuff too many missions into one hull. The CNO at the time, Admiral Clark, has decided based on wargaming that the Navy needed a CHEAP warship for focused missions on inshore waters i.e. a Corvette type vessel. However these wargames from 1999 to 2001 had also established the need for a small multirole vessel. The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) told the navy they needed more minesweeping, ASW, and the capability to eliminate, not small boats as you say but small cruise missile wielding vessels like Corvettes. Those would require a frigate type vessel for escorting i.e. a replacement for the OHPs, many of which were coming up for decommission soon. This played prominently into Admiral Clark's thinking. He decided the LCS would do both roles. Contrary to what some will say from the beginning of the vessel's conceptualization it was already trying to do both Frigate and Corvette roles.\n\nLeading into the next problem in this ship's problematic development is that there were no requirements for the vessel. Even congress expressed dismay at this fact in the National Defense Authorization Act of 2003 when the Admiral requested funding for the new project. It all spiralled downhill from there.\n\nIt's interesting reading the end of the paper as the author at the time had an optimistic outlook on the program. Almost 10 years later many of the things that gave the author a hope for a positive outcome habe not been successful. Both classes have similar operating costs to the Burke and are not affordable. The ASW module was unsuccessful because both classes are very noisy due to the speed requirement which dashed the hopes of a multirole vessel vessel even further to pieces. Both classes are significantly limited in speed due to problems with the combining gear and cracks in the hull so they can't actually achieve the speed. They were designed for. I can go on but I won't.\n\n[Another excellent paper which covered the current state of the program was the study released by the GAO in February 2022.](https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-22-105387.pdf) Interestingly, they mentioned the ship was designed to replace the Avenger minesweeper class, Cyclone patrol vessels, and the Oliver Hazard Perry (OHPs) Frigates. A point I've seen stated by many advocates (not on this subreddit) of the program is that the vessel was not actually designed to replace the OHPs so survivability was never a feature the vessel was designed to have in the first place. This is blatantly incorrect. The modularity of the vessels that we were sold on again and again? Doesn't exist. Different vessels are basically permanently assigned different modules because swapping modules requires to much refamiliarization training to be practical.\n\nHonorable mention to my personal crackpot theory that the Coast Guard Legend cutter class while not the perfect ship for the role would have been a far better pick than the LCS.",

The Ru:Ukr loss ratio is 0.6 along the Tokmak axis, while just a hair above 1 along Velyka Novosilka. I think this highlights that 1) Ukrainians have invested considerably more near Tokmak and 2) part of the appeal of fighting in Velyka Novosilka was better parity. Note that the overall ratio in Zapirozhizhia is just barely in Ukraine\u2019s favor, 439 Russian losses, 419 Ukrainian losses. \n2. There is a profound difference between where losses are occurring. Ukrainians tend to lose equipment right on the line of contact, while Russian losses can occur many kilometers south. This illustrates the deep strike capability Ukraine enjoys, but I\u2019m puzzled why Russia lacks this. \n3. The deep strike difference also suggests that Ukrainian losses in personnel may be higher than equipment alone would indicate. Since Ukrainian losses are along the line of contact, one can imagine the toll in lives is higher. As more Russian losses occur far behind lines, troop density around each loss may be less. I\u2019m not confident in this however.\n\nNote that when plotting this way I can only use precisely geolocated losses - Naalsio\u2019s sheet includes some losses that are definitely in Zaporizhizhia but cannot (or have not) been more precisely located.

A B-2 bomber is much larger than a Cesna, yet it will have a smaller radar signature.\n\nLow and slow drones sit in a blind spot for a lot of existing radars. These are relatively new to the battlefield, and so clutter rejection and similar filters on a lot of radars wasn't designed to take them into account. This will change with time.\n\nDepending on the size of the object relative to the wavelength of the radar, there's 3 basic scattering behaviors. \n\nWhen the wavelength is much smaller than the object, you get geometric/optical behavior. Waves bounce off based on Snell's law, and things generally work in a manner similar to what we're familiar with from optical frequencies. Here a radar can do things like image the object using synthetic aperture techniques, or can compare the specific reflected spectrum to a database of possible matches (this is called non cooperative target identification).\n\nWhen the wavelength is much larger than the object, the wave will largely diffract around the object. This is called Rayleigh scattering, and it drops off quite strongly once the wavelength is approximately 4x the longest dimension of the object. Here everything looks like a \"spherical cow\" to the radar, so while it may have position and velocity measurements, it won't know much else.\n\nBetween these two extremes, when the wavelength and the object are nearly the same, you get complex resonant behavior that's hard to talk about or predict other than via simulation.\n\nI think it's likely we'll see increased adoption of high frequency radars by SHORAD systems to handle small drones.",

Waves bounce off based on Snell&#39;s law, and things generally work in a manner similar to what we&#39;re familiar with from optical frequencies. Here a radar can do things like image the object using synthetic aperture techniques, or can compare the specific reflected spectrum to a database of possible matches (this is called non cooperative target identification).</p>\n\n<p>When the wavelength is much larger than the object, the wave will largely diffract around the object. This is called Rayleigh scattering, and it drops off quite strongly once the wavelength is approximately 4x the longest dimension of the object. Here everything looks like a &quot;spherical cow&quot; to the radar, so while it may have position and velocity measurements, it won&#39;t know much else.</p>\n\n<p>Between these two extremes, when the wavelength and the object are nearly the same, you get complex resonant behavior that&#39;s hard to talk about or predict other than via simulation.</p>\n\n<p>I think it&#39;s likely we&#39;ll see increased adoption of high frequency radars by SHORAD systems to handle small drones.</p>\n</div>",
