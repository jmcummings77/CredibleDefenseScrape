But what matters is not where we are, but where we're going, and at what speed?\n\nAs for Oryx reliability, I have manually verified them on multiple occasions, and the conclusion is, that for many classes of hardware they are mostly reliable.\n\nYou think there is a lostarmour bias? They count in most categories less ua losses than oryx. Oryx simply does a better job overall at aggregating footage, especially of the first period of the war.\n\nBUT contrary to popular belief, **oryx** while accurate of most classes of hardware, can be wildly inaccurate for some specific (but important) instances.\n\nPeople know that for example the many ka-52 footages very rarely make it to oryx but that is not even my point, I'm not talking about the ka-52 here.\n\nbut about lancet accounting in general, and particularly, accounting of lancet m777 strikes.If you follow the data like I did on the m777, the tracking of the losses till the end of 2022 is accurate but in 2023 they have mostly **stopped the count.** For many months they added **zero losses** despite frequent new lancet footage. Somewhat recently that added a few new losses but overall such blatant unaccounting of the m777 is so mediocre than one might wonder wether it is intentional.\n\nOut of the 67 Oryx \"footage\" we have 139 on lostarmour which I manually checked for redundancies, almost a 100% increase, that's what happens when you don't \"stop the count\" for 6 monthsOf the 139 lostarmour account 85 via the lancet and 139 - 85 = 54, which is close to the Oryx count (in fact until recently oryx count was stuck at \\~50)\n\n[https://lostarmour.info/tags/m777](https://lostarmour.info/tags/m777)\n\nNote that this major oryx flaw does not reproduce for the Krab or others, where lostarmour has similar numbers.so actually, UA has lost (damaged) 144/228 towed 155 = 63% of its 155mm towed artillery among which, 76% of its M777sSo yeah you migh think, great point, actually Ukraine will soon run out of NATO towed artillery, but they still have plenty of SPGs right?\n\nRight, they still have plenty of SPGs, but they will loose them quickly, here's why:\n\nif we assume that russia can maintain its lancet production of july/august, of \\~135 monthly.This is a pessimistic take (for russia) because we assume their production will not increase.I do this because september production is an anomaly (however I explained why (izdeleye 53)so 135 lancets per months,Every lancet on lostarmour (total 643) is assigned a target, therefore we know that 165 + 140 = total lancet artillery hits (MLRS already excluded)305 of 643 is 47%. Let's be slighly generous and say its 50% (which it is with mlrs)\n\nSo half of lancets hits artillery but like in most categories, ukraine soviet equipment is (or was) in greater quantity than all of europe military equipment combined, an often underappreciated fact.UA is not running out of soviet artillery tubes, at least not yet.\n\nThe thing is, as I've seen multiple excels files of UA artillery losses, \\~50% of UA artillery losses are NATO artillery, this bias, despite their low numbers can comes from two facts, one UA needs to use them as it is 152mm starved (ammo) and because they are a considerably higher strategic value target for russians (making UA ran out of its ability to use 155mm ammo)\n\nAnd this is precisly why russians are degenera te at strategy, they choose to  dilute 50% of their lancets on UA tanks/ifvs which are redundant with FPVs and lack this major attritic disruption potential.\n\nIn addition to effectively wasting 50% of its lancets continuously, russia is also wasting 50% of its 50% on hitting soviet UA artillery..\n\nThe end results of those consecutives consistent \"mistakes\" is that only 25% of lancets are expanded towards hitting 155mm tubes.\n\nnow we can finally do the precise calculus!\n\n25% of the assumed constant 135 (july number) lancets is \\~34\n\nRussia has \\~34 hits per months on 155mm arty, and UA has  144 + 69 = 209/627 = 418 artillery left.\n\n**And tadaaa 418/34 = 12**\n\n12 months from now on, in 12 months at a constant lancet rate (not at all the reality, as it will at least double), without taking into account any other source of artillery losses than lancets,\n\n**Q.E.D. that UA will have zero 155mm tubes in exactly a year.**\n\nOkay not exactly my initial claim but how many among you would have believed such as absolute mid term attrition?\n\nBut the situation is worse than that.Because there are other things than lancets in this war.\n\nIf we use the m777 as a representative baseline,out of 139, lostarmour says 85 are from UAVs (lancets) so 139 - 85 = 54\n\n54 of 139 = 39 percents which if we extrapolate a bit really means that 39 percents of arty losses are non-lancet based.\n\nThis however is absolutetely wrong as lancets in terms of numbers are a very recent development (4-5 months), hence non-lancet arty kills while hard to estimate are at best 10% of arty losses.\n\nIf we assume 10% (which btw is humili ating for the russian army)means 37.5 per month which means 418/37.5which means UA will run out of 155mm in 11 months, not a big change.\n\nI am also not taking into account arty losses via material ageing.This scenario is the most optimistic one by far for Ukraine as in reality lancet production will at least double in that period.\n\nMoreover Russia ineptly target soviet arty if they did not then they would **fully attrit NATO arty** **in 5 months**.\n\nMoreover if they allocated all lancets on nato arty, they would **fully attrit** in 418/135 = **3 months**\n\nRussia is now producing 600 FPVs per months which are all in range with deployed tanks/ifvs. **Hence** it is very likely that this development free 40% of lancets from this burden.\n\n**\\*\\*So a 6 months target for full NATO 155mm attrition is realistic, and for 10 months is conservative.\\*\\*** Despite the imminent and painfully predictable demise of UA artillery, you won't see anyone talk about it on CD before it is too late.\n\nThankfully, arty just like tanks and ifvs are all obscolete on the drone battlefield, hence UA will not loose the war when it will loose all its standard classes of military equipment. The myth will be deconstructed once and for all, for all to contemplate.",

The number of lancet footage this month went from 135 at its peak (in jully) to 30  and therefore \\~60 if we do a projection.\n\n[https://lostarmour.info/tags/lancet](https://lostarmour.info/tags/lancet)\n\nLancet is by far responsible for most UA equipment losses/damage\n\nWhile this downgrade is very lame from russia, according to leaks, this is because they are shifting production to two new models, one being a \"simplified\" lancet design meant to be cheaper/and/or easier to produce (with pics from the prototype)\n\nand a second design called something like izdeleye 53, which is supposed to have bigger payload and range and notably is tube launched. There are also leaks about software optimized for swarm use but this is a cringe topic as it doesn't provide any real value as operators are cheap, what does provide value against ER warfare would be an offline targeting ability but that remains to be seen.\n\nTherefore I bet that we should see those newer models in less than 3 months.\n\n2)\n\nFPV drones are by far responsible for most RU equipment losses/damage\n\nand UA has been scaling them up. I saw an estimate for last month where UA had reached its record, at slighly more than 300 FPV footage in a month\n\nI don't know the full count for this month (anyone knows a UA fpv tracker?)\n\nBut what is \"impressive\" is that RU has been significantly scaling FPV uses, since if we project, Russia will have published \\~600 FPV footage this month, which is twice the last UA record (current month UA fpv is unknown to me plz help) and more than twice the previous RU record (last month at 242)\n\n[https://lostarmour.info/tags/fpv](https://lostarmour.info/tags/fpv)\n\nIf we assume (hypothesis) that Russia is scaling up FPV use faster than UA then this is a big trend and the gap could increase.\n\n*However* that does not mean anything for now, because if you actually look at the footages we can see this:\n\nA large percentage (unknown though) of UA FPVs target valuable equipment like IFVs and tanks (and even SPGs which is weird range wise)\n\nMeanwhile, while at the start of the counteroffensive, russia had a somewhat similar ratio of FPV to valuable equipment targets, this has considerably changed, out of a daily 20 FPVs used, russia manage to only hit less than 1 tank per day, a bit less than 1 IFV per day and 1-2 low value APCs. The extreme majority of those FPVs are ineptly lost into targeting infantry (a negligible amount of deaths), \"buildings\", and strikingly, a large amount of \"civilian\" repurposed cars.\n\nThere can be two hypothesis from this UA/RU discrepancy:\n\n1. Russia would be extremely mediocre for not want to risk the lives of the FPV operators (as a reminder they are not much further than regular ATGMs operators and therefore are slighly exposed)\n\nIn both case that would be insane mediocrity given the military value of FPVs.\n\nthe second hypothesis which I find more likely, albeit it can be a bit of 1) too,\n\nis the striking observation that the front (meaning anywhere on the active front, withing the FPV range) have become almost **empty** of any UA IFVs/tanks. Hence Russia is left with no choice but an impossibility to target UA IFVs/tanks as they are simply not on the front.\n\nThis is the ockham's razor explanation and correlate with the previous FPV ratio of the counteroffensive.\n\nThat might seem cynical but I believe UAs officials, behing the marketing, knows the actual reality of modern warfare, which is that IFVs/tanks have become unable to have effects on the front and are just insta-killed now that RU has more FPVs per month than UA has tanks left at all.\n\nThis consequence however freeze the front for good unless they expect to revolutionize the effectiveness of infantry only + swarm of civilian cars (cf the famous toyota war) offensives.\n\nAs for why would this does not apply to Russians losses is that Russians have not yet accepted this cold hard but blatantly obvious truth. As UA fpvs destroy russian equipment at at increasingly unsustainable rate (already is) russia will gradually or even abruptly simply stop sendind IFVs/tanks to the front just like UA did.\n\nThe only other hypothesis would be to think that russians FPVs operators are all systematically inept, which is a non-credible take.\n\nOf course as this empirical observation (AKA a basic fact if you look at the footage) might not seem like a good look for Ukraine and therefore, the hive mind will be tempted to downvote me to hell? (currently seems to be the direction)\n\nWithout commenting about this usual mob behaviour, you should, attentive reader, observe that the FPV observation is the greatest news Ukraine could have ever hopped for, as it also means that Russia will never be able to take new territory.",

The extreme majority of those FPVs are ineptly lost into targeting infantry (a negligible amount of deaths), &quot;buildings&quot;, and strikingly, a large amount of &quot;civilian&quot; repurposed cars.</p>\n\n<p>There can be two hypothesis from this UA/RU discrepancy:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Russia would be extremely mediocre for not want to risk the lives of the FPV operators (as a reminder they are not much further than regular ATGMs operators and therefore are slighly exposed)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In both case that would be insane mediocrity given the military value of FPVs.</p>\n\n<p>the second hypothesis which I find more likely, albeit it can be a bit of 1) too,</p>\n\n<p>is the striking observation that the front (meaning anywhere on the active front, withing the FPV range) have become almost <strong>empty</strong> of any UA IFVs/tanks. Hence Russia is left with no choice but an impossibility to target UA IFVs/tanks as they are simply not on the front.</p>\n\n<p>This is the ockham&#39;s razor explanation and correlate with the previous FPV ratio of the counteroffensive.</p>\n\n<p>That might seem cynical but I believe UAs officials, behing the marketing, knows the actual reality of modern warfare, which is that IFVs/tanks have become unable to have effects on the front and are just insta-killed now that RU has more FPVs per month than UA has tanks left at all.</p>\n\n<p>This consequence however freeze the front for good unless they expect to revolutionize the effectiveness of infantry only + swarm of civilian cars (cf the famous toyota war) offensives.</p>\n\n<p>As for why would this does not apply to Russians losses is that Russians have not yet accepted this cold hard but blatantly obvious truth. As UA fpvs destroy russian equipment at at increasingly unsustainable rate (already is) russia will gradually or even abruptly simply stop sendind IFVs/tanks to the front just like UA did.</p>\n\n<p>The only other hypothesis would be to think that russians FPVs operators are all systematically inept, which is a non-credible take.</p>\n\n<p>Of course as this empirical observation (AKA a basic fact if you look at the footage) might not seem like a good look for Ukraine and therefore, the hive mind will be tempted to downvote me to hell? (currently seems to be the direction)</p>\n\n<p>Without commenting about this usual mob behaviour, you should, attentive reader, observe that the FPV observation is the greatest news Ukraine could have ever hopped for, as it also means that Russia will never be able to take new territory.</p>\n</div>",

Because most will hit one person and many won't reliably hit anyone so an average of 2 seems almost optimistic. A **very** optimistic take would be 3 injured people for one fpv on average.\n\nLet's go with that very optimistic estimate, 600 \\* 3 = 1800 monthly\n\nUkraine can expand at minimum one million people so at this rate it would take **500+ years** for Russia to eliminate the Ukrainian army.\n\nThis rate however is kinda nullified with a positive reproduction rate of the UA population.\n\nCan you see how inept the argument is?\n\nUA will never run out of people with current FPVs production.\n\nAnd indeed hitting APC/IMVs is a more reliable way to kill infantry as a HMMWs and M113 are utterly destroyed after an RPG-7 warhead.\n\nAt 600 per month, Russia could in one month destroy every single UA tanks left. Which one do you think has more impact and additionally propaganda value?\n\nOf course Russia FPV production will increase and hitting infantry might become a sound strategy when russia will have 10000 FPVs per months to expand, but until then (which is not until a long time (16 months assuming production is **doubled** each month)), it is inept.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\> both sides still use armour as fire and logistical support. While I can't tell you how much they do so, Ukraine does publish footage of such, even on the southern front.\n\nIndirect fire only real use is to scare people. It scares the infantry but is so unaccurate that it doesn't reliably hit them. It is mostly a mere mild psychological weapon.\n\nI have seen the marketing footage of tanks and IFVs in action, but the real thing is what amount of equipment losses do they incurs?\n\ntanks and ifvs have destroyed a negligible amount of tanks and ifvs or even APCs.\n\nWe know that because 1) there is consistently no footage from both sides and 2) for example among others, UA still has a few t64  left and we have footage evidence of \\~370+ of them being damaged and they had \\~500 (not all operational) prior to the war. As this gap diminish, of all footage a negligible amount comes from Tank on tank or ifv on tank. Therefore it is proven that their effect is irrelevant even assuming unobserved losses and this become truer and truer as the footage number become closer and closer to the total 500.",

A <strong>very</strong> optimistic take would be 3 injured people for one fpv on average.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s go with that very optimistic estimate, 600 * 3 = 1800 monthly</p>\n\n<p>Ukraine can expand at minimum one million people so at this rate it would take <strong>500+ years</strong> for Russia to eliminate the Ukrainian army.</p>\n\n<p>This rate however is kinda nullified with a positive reproduction rate of the UA population.</p>\n\n<p>Can you see how inept the argument is?</p>\n\n<p>UA will never run out of people with current FPVs production.</p>\n\n<p>And indeed hitting APC/IMVs is a more reliable way to kill infantry as a HMMWs and M113 are utterly destroyed after an RPG-7 warhead.</p>\n\n<p>At 600 per month, Russia could in one month destroy every single UA tanks left. Which one do you think has more impact and additionally propaganda value?</p>\n\n<p>Of course Russia FPV production will increase and hitting infantry might become a sound strategy when russia will have 10000 FPVs per months to expand, but until then (which is not until a long time (16 months assuming production is <strong>doubled</strong> each month)), it is inept.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&gt; both sides still use armour as fire and logistical support. While I can&#39;t tell you how much they do so, Ukraine does publish footage of such, even on the southern front.</p>\n\n<p>Indirect fire only real use is to scare people. It scares the infantry but is so unaccurate that it doesn&#39;t reliably hit them. It is mostly a mere mild psychological weapon.</p>\n\n<p>I have seen the marketing footage of tanks and IFVs in action, but the real thing is what amount of equipment losses do they incurs?</p>\n\n<p>tanks and ifvs have destroyed a negligible amount of tanks and ifvs or even APCs.</p>\n\n<p>We know that because 1) there is consistently no footage from both sides and 2) for example among others, UA still has a few t64  left and we have footage evidence of ~370+ of them being damaged and they had ~500 (not all operational) prior to the war. As this gap diminish, of all footage a negligible amount comes from Tank on tank or ifv on tank. Therefore it is proven that their effect is irrelevant even assuming unobserved losses and this become truer and truer as the footage number become closer and closer to the total 500.</p>\n</div>",

So many people saying\n\n\"artillery is  k i n g.\"\n\nThe thing is (or was) that russia used 10 time the ammount of artillery than UA, and despite this and their superiority of spotter drones (orlans), the video footage of artillery induced losses is very low.

This is the second commander of the 247th to have been killed: Colonel Konstantin Zizevsky fell in action during the first days of the war, in all probability during the battles on the outskirts of Mykolaiv. I could be wrong, but this is the first case of a regiment/brigade losing its commander in action twice.\n\nPopov reportedly took over a few weeks ago to replace the former commander (with the same surname as him) who had been replaced because of complaints from soldiers of the regiment after the failed counterattacks near Staromaiorske back in July. \n\nIt's unclear whether he died in the Velyka Novosilka sector or in the Orikhiv/Tokmak sector, i.e. where most of the regiment was very recently transferred and where it joined the rest of the 7th VDV Division. The 247th suffered very significant losses in the two and a half months of fighting in the Velyka Novosilka sector.\n\nOn an unrelated note, in the Tokmak sector the Russians deployed a fire control network in order to enhance their counter-battery capabilities. The network is an automated tactical management system, based on the portable satellite communication station SNARK-100P system (Manpack class). The Ukrainians have compared the latter with Starlink, which is what they use for the same purpose. This network should be in use at the 76th VDV Division.  This division is also one of the main Lancet users if not the first. It's clear that the Russians wish to step up their counter-battery game. \n\nSince the beginning of September, Ukrainian artillery fire in the Tokmak sector has increased greatly, also thanks to the use of numerous cluster munitions (which the Ukrainians wish were sent in larger numbers!). Right now the artillery is very active in striking Russian positions while the forces involved in the attacks in the sector (which have been reported by Ukrainian sources to have lost some combat capability) are \"settling down\" and mostly maintaining the positions they have conquered, waiting for the next attacks that will include more fresh units. Ukrainian artillery fires have been definitely noticed by the Russians: I had read on Telegram that an unknown Russian air assault regiment had complained last week that a crazy amount of shells had fallen in their defense area in a single day.

It was *never* intended to field combat formations, or manpower of significant numbers. The goal with the Reserve was and is to preserve skills of import to the Army. Hence the smaller manpower pool. Hence the lack of major combat formations. Hence the subordinate status. The *manpower* reserve is, and always has been, the Army National Guard. Nobody likes the Guard, because its stupid and corrupt, but it has about 330k men in it and possess combat formations. According to the Guard themselves, they can within 90 days of call-up put into the field a unit which is as capable of combat operations as the Regular Army. Debatable, but thats the claim and thats the expectation regarding post-mob warplaning. The Guard also maintains its *own* reserve force, which gives it further callup potential post-90 day. Outside of that, the draft would be required to replace combat losses.

NatGuard). \n\nNot only that but the politics in Congress agitate against the policy recommendation here. If men are drafted into the Active Army directly, this leaves the ARNG where it was in the 1950s which was not a happy time or place for them, and by extension not a choice which will be supported by fifty state Guards, the national Guard Association, or fifty state Governors who just saw their private armies hacked off at the knees.

These generally are indicative of a frat-boy culture which ought to not be too surprising. Personal harassment is pretty common, but not an existential issue (though I struggle to see how a black soldier forced to march in chains could be later expected to mobilize and fight with that same unit). More troubling is the misuse of material and assets. For example the F-16 pilot who flew his jet to DC to fuck his mistress, not only is that a bad look but its potentially jeopardizing a future mission if eg. that jet is down for service because it overspent hours doing stupid shit. Most concerning, though, are the accounts of retaliation regarding whistleblowing. This kind of 'Frat-boy' culture, IMO, inevitably leads to groups acting poorly, closing ranks around members of the in-group, and eventually trying to silence people they perceive as attacking said in-group. You see this in several cases of harassment, or even firebombing the home of one whistleblower in one instance. Again, we have a basic question: can an institution at war with itself then pull together if needed to complete a new more intense mission abroad? But beyond that I have a hard time believing that somebody is just going to fling molotovs at the house of a person who accused a higher up of sexual assault.

And then when he resigned in disgrace, Christie got another guy in hot water with the active forces to step back and into the NJNG. And then were shocked when guys with bad track records, who control hundreds of millions or billions of funds, misuse them. Look back at the frat-club problem, you can really see how these problems at the top then permeate the rest of the state's forces. Accountability is a necessary component of anticorruption measures, yet the Guard consistently dodges any responsibility for what they do. If you cant bag an officer obvious sexual assault, if officers and men are resorting to molotovs to protect those accused of assault, how can you expect the same force to police financial crimes? The other person who responded to you suggested that the Guard isn't selling equipment. *But how can you be sure* in an institution which has a documented history of having tried aggressively to cover up even low level offenses? More to the point, how can you trust such an institution to mobilize on the very tight schedule they've given for themselves (90 days, when in the 1990s the Regular Army was saying they couldn't even do it in 180) to meet needs? \n\nAnd thats before you get to the Thug Shaker angle of all this, which is entirely Congress' fault for having closed their eyes to problems and shuffled significant EAD HQ functions into Guard units.

But had he been doing something else, stealing materials from the armory, hell stealing office supplies and reselling them, would his superiors have blown the whistle? Or transferred him to another unit so he can keep doing the stupid shit he did before? IDK. But when it comes to some of this other lower level hazing stuff the message has been clear, pass the buck, transfer the problem, dont take accountability for mistakes or problems.

I think the US goes full drone/air warfare on the front line of any battle field and keeps as many people behind the lines as possible operating ATACM/artillery/AA etc etc and then sends in SOF or contractors for clean up.  We will never see a million man Pear Harbor level volunteer force.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s my completely amateur opinion.</p>\n</div>",

            "body": "Iran has always been beset by three factions, hardliners, moderates, and radicals. The Shah used to be a fourth pillar in this system, but post revolution the Ayatollahs have been instead a kind of kingmaker on top of this. But otherwise the factions in Iran have been pretty consistent through its modern history.\n\nIn the modern 21st century construction, the street radicals are those fighting for a true democracy and against the current government. Theyre outside of power, but as we saw this past year have a ton of popular support and are a genuine threat (and thus real power) to the government. The moderates work within the current system to implement a kind of constitutional democracy, they favor less antagonism regionally, greater integration with the west, and a resolution of the US/Iran issue (as that is a barrier to a globally orient Iran). Hardliners have strong connections to the military, Quds force, and IRGC in particular. They represent a more conservative, nationalist pole in Iranian politics (though the moderate faction does itself have some important nationalist emphasis). The hardliners are the most likely to back the regime and the religiously centered nature of the government, and so often enjoy pretty explicit Ayatollah support. They are also the most bellicose both in their relations in the region as well as with the US and the world. \n\nThe collapse of the JCPOA in 2016 was a real blow to the moderates, who argued that Iran could negotiate with the US in good faith and produce real durable agreements. When that proved not to be the case, the hardliners were able to take power and pushed for greater confrontation. The loss of the JCPOA was a real 'told you so' moment for them. Then COVID hit, falling oil prices, and ultimately the street protest movement. The hardliners, as they always are, struggled to deal with these new challenges and inflamed the actions of the street radicals looking for greater democracy. The result has been a shift in Iranian court politics, with the moderate faction looking to come back in post-uprising and demonstrate that the regime is more benevolent that recent events may suggest. And with them, a greater integration into the western world. A new agreement with the Biden administration (especially if you take the view that theyre likely to win in 2024, and thus secure a deal more longterm) is obviously attractive in proving that it can be done and would benefit Iran. But also there is a rather wise hedge with the Russians, highlighting that Iran is both a global player AND has options other than reproachmont with the US. \n\nAlso importantly, the Iranian system is more decentralized than people realize. What frustrates outside observers is the truth that the Iran government really can do two seemingly contradictory things simultaneously. This is the result of the independence and wide latitude given to orgs like the IRGC, as well as to the so-call \"Iranian backed militias\" abroad which often act on their own or with the tacit support of only a small slice of the Iranian establishment. But the result is that it is both possible and consistent with Iranian politics for the moderate center in Tehran to offer an olive branch while IRGC hardliners on the coast send out boats to harass shipping. Because in Iran only the Ayatollahs have anything resembling complete control. This, naturally, frustrates potential partners and is a huge stumbling block wrt negotiations with the US.",

The Indians did fairly well, even their mig 21s. And the data was useful for the Airforce to identify weaknesses in their operating procedures and capabilities in close combat. In reality they would never even get a chance to respond to the US air forces BVR capability.</p>\n</div>",

They prevented any hope of a quick coup in Kyiv, and even ground the Russians to a halt in the Donbas, then going on the offensive and restoring west Kherson and most of Kharkiv oblast.  However, this alone isn't enough to win the war.\n\nBoth sides are looking for a conclusive end to the war **on their terms**.   At present, this is not possible.  Ukraine launched a summer offensive with the goal of making significant inroads into Russia's \"land bridge\", arguably the most valuable piece of land Russia's claimed this war.  Would that have worked, Ukraine would (provided continued western support) be on track to reclaim most of their territory lost in this war, and perhaps even credibly threaten Crimea.  Basically, they were hoping to get into a winning negotiating position.\n\nUnfortunately, the offensive for now has not achieved these goals, and it's looking very possible it may not.  There may be future offensives, but that's predicated on western aid, more on that later.\n\nAnyway, failing decisive territory changes both sides are defaulting to a strategy of wearing the other down by attrition.  It's hard to evaluate who's going to win (I'd go as far as to say impossible).  For example, mere hours ago a great youtuber published a conversation on this very topic:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrtAwT2sgs\n\nDespite being very well researched, the conclusion of the video is ultimately \"idk lol\".\n\nPersonally, I think the decisive factor for this war will be continued western aid.  While not trivial, I think the west can absolutely provide enough aid (provided Ukraine uses it wisely) to grind down Russia.  The question is if there is political will for that, and ultimately I think that will decide the war.",

Ukraine launched a summer offensive with the goal of making significant inroads into Russia&#39;s &quot;land bridge&quot;, arguably the most valuable piece of land Russia&#39;s claimed this war.  Would that have worked, Ukraine would (provided continued western support) be on track to reclaim most of their territory lost in this war, and perhaps even credibly threaten Crimea.  Basically, they were hoping to get into a winning negotiating position.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the offensive for now has not achieved these goals, and it&#39;s looking very possible it may not.  There may be future offensives, but that&#39;s predicated on western aid, more on that later.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, failing decisive territory changes both sides are defaulting to a strategy of wearing the other down by attrition.  It&#39;s hard to evaluate who&#39;s going to win (I&#39;d go as far as to say impossible).  For example, mere hours ago a great youtuber published a conversation on this very topic:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrtAwT2sgs\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrtAwT2sgs</a></p>\n\n<p>Despite being very well researched, the conclusion of the video is ultimately &quot;idk lol&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I think the decisive factor for this war will be continued western aid.  While not trivial, I think the west can absolutely provide enough aid (provided Ukraine uses it wisely) to grind down Russia.  The question is if there is political will for that, and ultimately I think that will decide the war.</p>\n</div>",
