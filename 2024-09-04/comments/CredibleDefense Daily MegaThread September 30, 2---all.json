As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

        "body": "Since it doesn't seem like anyone has covered this yet, I wanted to discuss the [recent War on the Rocks interview with Michael Kofman about the state of the Ukrainian offensive and Zelensky's visit to Washington.](https://warontherocks.com/2023/09/one-tree-line-at-a-time-breaching-russian-defenses-in-ukraine/)\n\nSome key takeaways:\n* Ukrainian progress South of Bakhmut is notable, will be interesting to see if they can take high ground around Kurdymivka. \n\n\n* There's been a renewed Ukrainian push towards Verbove, which is the linchpin of Russian defenses in the area, and is now being held by VDV from 7th and 76th divisions. There's a debate in the community about whether Russia has enough forces to hold considering their deployment of so many strategic reserves to the area. \n\n\n* Calls the Ukrainian advances beyond the 2nd Surovikin line is a \"breach\" not a breakthrough, since the Russian defense is being pressed but not collapsing. \n\n\n* He goes into a discussion about how to define a breakthrough vs a breach, says he tends to be conservative about it. Troops don't like it when you claim victory on their behalf, or declare they've broken enemy lines when they aren't there yet. Also misleading to the public. \n\n\n* To consider it a breakthrough, he would like to see Ukrainian mechanized/motorized units operating behind the line largely uncontested and see significant withdrawals of Russian forces, not just 100m at a time. It entails a sense of momentum. \n\n\n* Kofman \"I wanna be optimistic about this, I think Ukrainian forces are widening a breach through this line of defense that they hope to turn into a breakthrough.\" It remains to be seen if Ukrainians can pick up the pace or if the current (slow) pace of advance will continue *up to the Winter or through the Winter*.\n\n\n* Current assessment of the offensive: Ukrainian forces have penetrated the first Russian line of defense and in some places the second line of defense, causing a breach not a breakthrough of Russian lines though it might be trending in that direction. \n\n\n* Q: This offensive may continue indefinitely at the current pace, how do you judge its success if that happens? A: analysts need to bound and judge an offensive based on their own framework, it's rare that offensives are announced to be over. If the Ukrainian objective is to continue pressing Russian forces going into the Winter, and also through the Winter then the intensity of fighting might eventually decline to a level which can be sustained through the Winter, which will make it challenging for analysts to determine when to call the offensive over or not. Kofman clarifies that he doesn't see it this way, he will judge the offensive based on the goals it set for itself: namely the maximalist goal of reaching the Azov coast and capture of Melitopol as well as the minimalist goal of reaching Tokmak. \n\n\n* If Ukrainian forces are able to reach Tokmak he would consider the offensive a qualified success. Even if they don't, it could still be considered a success depending on the damage they are able to inflict on Russian forces vs what they themselves suffered. \n\n\n* **Kofman thinks Ukraine likely has a positive ratio of casualties and equipment destroyed in this offensive.** He also thinks Ukraine likely has the ammunition available to continue the offensive into or through the Winter, though he's unsure about Ukrainian force availability to continue the offensive that long. He thinks the Ukrainian military is aiming to keep the initiative at least into the Winter. \n\n\n* He thinks Ukraine is able to rotate their forces launching attacks in Zaporizhzhia adequately, but its unclear what the state of Ukrainian assault forces are, which is different from the number of brigades Ukraine has available on paper. \n\n\n* Weather won't impact the offensive if it continues at the current pace, but if Ukrainians are hoping for a breakthrough, that would be affected since vehicles are required for higher pace of movement. If Ukraine doesn't achieve a breakthrough, it will be a very long slog to Tokmak. \n\n\n* Goal of Zelensky's visit was to advocate for the $24b supplemental aid package to Ukraine stuck in Congress. Kofman thinks that those in Washington who hoped Ukraine's offensive would put them in a superior negotiating position have abandoned these hopes and people are starting to wake up to the fact that this will be a short war and that all the potential opportunities to end the war more quickly have been missed. Ukraine will need Western investment in their domestic equipment production and maintenance facilities, and increased Western training support to enable them to reconstite their forces. \n\n\n* Long periods of heavy attritional fighting is going to become necessary to put pressure on Russian forces and prevent them from being able to go on the offensive, and Ukraine will need Western support to be able to do this. \n\n\n* Kofman hopes that key decisionmakers are finally coming to the realization that this is a long war and it will continue for a long time, and that Ukraine needs longterm commitments and investments to keep up the fight. \n\n\n* Without another round of mobilization Kofman doesn't think Russia will be able to go on the offensive again. \n\n\n* Kofman differentiated between Ukrainian Intelligence Service drone campaign and the military cruise missiles strike campaign. He thinks the GUR campaign is focused on getting Russian domestic audience to wake up to the fact that there's a war going on and especially to convince Russian elites that there's no guarantee of Russian victory and their livelihoods are also on the line. The military cruise missiles campaign is more focused on solid military targets, especially on degrading the Russian Black Sea fleet and potentially forcing them to rebase to Novorossisk. Western support in targeting and ISR and the inherent difficulty in defending Crimea has made this strike campaign quite effective. He also thinks we're actually looking at a number of different parts of the Ukrainian military with different goals and strategies and lumping them altogether. \n\n\n* Ukrainians are likely to get the M29 cluster munitions variant of ATACMS. It's shorter range, but should prove effective targeting Russian forward helicopter operating bases (like Berdiansk), as well as Russian force concentrations, and time sensitive targets. Unclear how many they will receive/how many are available. Importantly ISR is crucial to how they will be employed, and as is Ukraine has difficulty targeting positions 30+ km behind the line. As such there's an expectation that the West (US) would assist with targeting, but that would require very close coordination that likely doesn't exist at the moment. It's likely only high level commanders will be able to approve the use of these munitions, which will affect what targets they are used on. They'll also be largely ineffective against Russian AD targets since Russia has way more S-300 and S-400 TELs than there are ATACMS.\n\nOverall, it seems like Kofman is actually still somewhat optimistic about the potential for a Ukrainian breakthrough, or barring that, their ability to keep pressing the Russians over the next few months and potentially through the Winter.",

But because Russia builds its defenses in some depth, they seem to be good with mutually supporting positions, and have highly mobile ATGM platforms (eg. KA-52) its extremely hard to build momentum.\n\nWhether its a treeline or a trenchline or a network of towns, the solution to the problem youre describing is to punch through faster than the enemy can congeal around another position. You break through tree line A and hit tree line B so quickly that the enemy there has not built trenches, so you bowl them over. Then by the time youre up to C nobody is home and nothing is stopping you. Armor, mounted attacks, air support (which UKR doesn't have), SHORAD, and flexible artillery all need to work in combination to let you break through and get into open air. \n\nThe problems they have are that Russian positions are designed smartly and force infantry to dismount, slowing the pace of an attack to a crawl. In modern war there is basically no way to keep an enemy from taking a position long term, but you can 100% slow them down so much that casualties and wasted time poison the value of the gain. Ukraine did this fighting over each hamlet and street around Bakhmut, Russia does this now in the south, both to great effect. If it takes you a week to grind through treeline A, treeline B is going to be well fortified. And if it takes you a week to grind through treeline B, treeline C will have had two weeks to prepare and is not going to be a pushover. Russia also mixes into this aggressive counter attacks designed to restore treeline A which further slows the process down, and thus buys them time. What will eventually break the UKR attack will be casualties, weapons depletion, and local ammo shortages. Units will need to take time to rest and regenerate and at that point the attacks will stop. \n\nThe solution to the problem above is the same, but it requires some good planning and for your side to discover mistakes the enemy has made. It also requires your force be flexible enough (and enough of it remains uncommitted) to exploit any gaps you may see in the line. In the Yom Kippur war, for example, the Israelis found a gap less than a mile in width in the Egyptian lines and used that as their breakthrough point. They committed two full divisions (which was a significant outlaying of strength, and included the last of their uncommitted reserves in that region). And even then the Egyptians tried to hard to block their access to the canal. The difference from then to now is that, so far, it doesn't seem Russia has been careless enough to leave the door open for UKR, so they instead waste time kicking it down instead of punching forward. \n\nA larger operational critique, or perhaps question, I have is what about in other sectors? Russia is strong in the far north and around Tokomak. Sure these places are strategically vital. But does their strength there open up places in eg. Kherson oblast which the UA can blast through, and which might accomplish the operational object without fighting for every tree line? Or which will force the moving of reserves to match.",

Since Ukraine would be shooting at Russian territory, the red Russian territorial fires effectively represent Ukrainian firepower, while the blue represents Russian firepower.*\n\n\n- This has been a very dry September, there are a few video's of wildfires in fields near Marioupol for example that that when checking FIRMS has several fields worth of area in red. This despite having no attack I've seen tied to it, rather people complaining about Russian occupiers not putting it out, would then get classified as a heavy bombardment under such a AI. I believe such things are almost certainly happening elsewhere on the front falsely inflating data for both sides. /mariupolnow/35113 /mariupolnow/35035\n\n- Terrain also will cause this to inflate heavily, a dead forest will likely cause a much higher signature than a living forest which in turn would would have a higher signature from impacts than positions say along a damp swampy area. This throws off the data.\n\n- Weapons used also matter a ton. A heat map will naturally favor incendiary weapons if use for a prolonged period or when successful in settings things alight.  While most accounts I've seen (please correct me if I'm wrong) put Russia as using these more, this naturally would cause heavy inflation.\n\n- Military related accidental fires are also pretty common. The most notable type I want to bring up is rocket artillery launches, I have personally seen quite a few video's from both sides where as a byproduct of such launches they end up settings the launch field or part of that field on fire on accident. When the Russian crews need to relocate fast to dodge getting a HIMARS or a Ukraine crew needs to do the same to dodge getting a Lancet even if they notice a fire starting they may not have time or safety to put it out.

        "body": "Should US procure submarines - and surface ships - from allies?  Below is an op-ed piece by Seth Cropsey from WJS.\n\nThe Sorry State of America\u2019s Submarine Fleet\n\nThe U.S. submarine fleet is in a dire state. The U.S. doesn\u2019t have the domestic infrastructure to repair and sustain its existing subs, much less expand the fleet. America needs to get creative to sustain its undersea advantage. The Navy should procure conventionally powered submarines from U.S. allies, namely Japan and South Korea. The moment is ripe, given the leadership of Rahm Emanuel, the U.S. ambassador to Japan, and a potential breakthrough in Japan-South Korea relations.  \nThe U.S. faces a parlous Indo-Pacific position amid a shifting situation in the Taiwan Strait. A decade ago, the People\u2019s Liberation Army was growing larger and more sophisticated but remained incapable of taking Taiwan. Today China has three aircraft carriers\u2014two made domestically, one imported\u2014and is building a fourth, its first true supercarrier. The PLA has a surface force larger than the U.S. Navy\u2019s battle force\u2014that is, the total number of combat ships in the U.S. Navy. It has eight guided-missile cruisers and dozens of destroyers and frigate warships\u2014and its many shipyards aren\u2019t idle. The PLA\u2019s missiles generally out-range American ones even if its sensors are less sophisticated.  \nAsking if China is \u201cready\u201d to take Taiwan misses the mark. China no longer lacks any crucial capabilities. China could invade Taiwan tomorrow and win, although its odds of success are between 30% and 40% if the U.S. resists. If the U.S. doesn\u2019t join the fight, Chinese victory would be nearly certain. A below-half probability of victory should counsel caution in Beijing. But these odds are far greater than they were 10 or even five years ago. Rather than whether China is ready for a war, the correct question is: What circumstances might prompt China to wage a war, rather than expand its capabilities?  \nIn the Sino-American military balance, America\u2019s greatest advantage is its submarine fleet. Our 50 nuclear-powered attack submarines are heavily armed with torpedoes and missiles and soon will deploy unmanned underwater vehicles and more-advanced loitering munitions, a flying drone with a warhead that can wait some time before engaging a target. Our four nuclear-powered guided-missile submarines carry 154 cruise missiles each. Critically, China\u2019s greatest weakness is undersea warfare. The PLA is building a fleet of antisubmarine surface-combatant vessels and procuring more maritime patrol aircraft.  \nChina is expanding and improving a seabed sensor network to detect submarines within the First Island Chain. Significant gaps, however, will remain for at least another decade. This explains why the U.S. assumes that American attack submarines will play the greatest offensive role in an Indo-Pacific War, since they could stealthily disrupt a Chinese invasion of Taiwan and destroy the warships and ground-based targets critical to China\u2019s reconnaissance-strike network. That would let heavy but vulnerable U.S. supercarriers and strategic bombers strike targets and avoid a Chinese counterattack.  \nThe U.S. Navy\u2019s submarine fleet, however, is in lamentable shape. Of the total U.S. fleet, about 40% of vessels are in maintenance and repair facilities at any given time. This puts the fleet at roughly 30 deployable boats at best, rather than the 40 to 45 expected at operating level. In addition, the Navy is retiring two submarines a year on average, but building only three every two years, leading to a net annual decline. U.S. production looks unable to reverse this. The issue isn\u2019t yards\u2014although another short-term maintenance yard would ease the stress on larger facilities\u2014but parts. Submarines are extraordinarily complex, requiring components in a lengthy supply chain. It takes years to procure the specific undersea sensors, fire-control systems and other crucial internal parts for each boat.  \nThe problem requires not only more spending but also greater creativity, since the fleet will shrink until the 2030s. As America\u2019s undersea advantage narrows, a Chinese attack becomes more probable. If China can knock out an American yard through cyber means, sabotage or even direct assault, then U.S. backlogs will mushroom, cutting the submarine force to 10 or 20 boats and tilting the balance in China\u2019s favor.  \nOne short-term solution is procuring conventionally powered submarines, a step the U.S. hasn\u2019t taken since the middle of the Cold War. In the long run, the U.S. needs nuclear-powered submarines, which can cruise from bases to combat zones and back without refueling. They are larger, enabling a greater weapons payload and, in the future, more unmanned systems. Over a submarine\u2019s life cycle, nuclear power is cheaper than conventional power.  \nConventionally powered boats\u2014of smaller size, inferior range and lesser payloads\u2014are easier to build than their nuclear cousins. If made properly, they also are quieter than nuclear boats. Modern battery-powered and diesel-electric subs can be almost silent.  \nA small nonnuclear fleet of between 12 and 24 boats wouldn\u2019t provide the same combat capacity as even 10 Virginia-class nuclear-powered attack submarines, since these boats play a different role. But they are far cheaper, running between $500 million and $1 billion apiece, compared with $4 billion plus for a Virginia. Nonnuclear subs can be used directly in the region as surface and transport ship hunters. Deployed from the Philippines, Japan and South Korea, and potentially sustained from Guam with a larger submarine tender fleet, conventionally powered submarines would lighten the burden of the strained nuclear fleet. By the 2040s, production expansions will have allowed the U.S. to phase out these boats and replace them with nuclear-powered ones.  \nThe U.S. lacks the domestic infrastructure to build conventionally powered boats. But its allies are world leaders in the technology. Japan\u2019s Soryu-class submarine, a Mitsubishi-Kawasaki co-project, has a range of more than 6,000 miles. Japanese yards take about two years to build one of these boats and can start a new one every year. Korea\u2019s KSS-III, a Hanwha-Hyundai product, slightly larger than the Japanese Soryu, can even launch ballistic missiles, broadening its mission profile. Korean yards can produce one ship in three years and typically start a hull every year. Both ships are on the export market.  \nTo improve South Korean-Japanese relations, the U.S. recently conducted a summit that has opened the possibility of trilateral military cooperation. The summit was the fruit of months of diplomacy, primarily by Mr. Emanuel. The Biden administration should explore either a co-production arrangement or outright purchase of batches from each power with the goal of fielding a dozen such attack submarines by 2030.  \nThe Biden administration has made diplomatic strides toward improving America\u2019s position in the Indo-Pacific but has largely neglected military questions. It has a rare opportunity to shore up the military balance with diplomatic means.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Should US procure submarines - and surface ships - from allies?  Below is an op-ed piece by Seth Cropsey from WJS.</p>\n\n<p>The Sorry State of America\u2019s Submarine Fleet</p>\n\n<p>The U.S. submarine fleet is in a dire state. The U.S. doesn\u2019t have the domestic infrastructure to repair and sustain its existing subs, much less expand the fleet. America needs to get creative to sustain its undersea advantage. The Navy should procure conventionally powered submarines from U.S. allies, namely Japan and South Korea. The moment is ripe, given the leadership of Rahm Emanuel, the U.S. ambassador to Japan, and a potential breakthrough in Japan-South Korea relations.<br/>\nThe U.S. faces a parlous Indo-Pacific position amid a shifting situation in the Taiwan Strait. A decade ago, the People\u2019s Liberation Army was growing larger and more sophisticated but remained incapable of taking Taiwan. Today China has three aircraft carriers\u2014two made domestically, one imported\u2014and is building a fourth, its first true supercarrier. The PLA has a surface force larger than the U.S. Navy\u2019s battle force\u2014that is, the total number of combat ships in the U.S. Navy. It has eight guided-missile cruisers and dozens of destroyers and frigate warships\u2014and its many shipyards aren\u2019t idle. The PLA\u2019s missiles generally out-range American ones even if its sensors are less sophisticated.<br/>\nAsking if China is \u201cready\u201d to take Taiwan misses the mark. China no longer lacks any crucial capabilities. China could invade Taiwan tomorrow and win, although its odds of success are between 30% and 40% if the U.S. resists. If the U.S. doesn\u2019t join the fight, Chinese victory would be nearly certain. A below-half probability of victory should counsel caution in Beijing. But these odds are far greater than they were 10 or even five years ago. Rather than whether China is ready for a war, the correct question is: What circumstances might prompt China to wage a war, rather than expand its capabilities?<br/>\nIn the Sino-American military balance, America\u2019s greatest advantage is its submarine fleet. Our 50 nuclear-powered attack submarines are heavily armed with torpedoes and missiles and soon will deploy unmanned underwater vehicles and more-advanced loitering munitions, a flying drone with a warhead that can wait some time before engaging a target. Our four nuclear-powered guided-missile submarines carry 154 cruise missiles each. Critically, China\u2019s greatest weakness is undersea warfare. The PLA is building a fleet of antisubmarine surface-combatant vessels and procuring more maritime patrol aircraft.<br/>\nChina is expanding and improving a seabed sensor network to detect submarines within the First Island Chain. Significant gaps, however, will remain for at least another decade. This explains why the U.S. assumes that American attack submarines will play the greatest offensive role in an Indo-Pacific War, since they could stealthily disrupt a Chinese invasion of Taiwan and destroy the warships and ground-based targets critical to China\u2019s reconnaissance-strike network. That would let heavy but vulnerable U.S. supercarriers and strategic bombers strike targets and avoid a Chinese counterattack.<br/>\nThe U.S. Navy\u2019s submarine fleet, however, is in lamentable shape. Of the total U.S. fleet, about 40% of vessels are in maintenance and repair facilities at any given time. This puts the fleet at roughly 30 deployable boats at best, rather than the 40 to 45 expected at operating level. In addition, the Navy is retiring two submarines a year on average, but building only three every two years, leading to a net annual decline. U.S. production looks unable to reverse this. The issue isn\u2019t yards\u2014although another short-term maintenance yard would ease the stress on larger facilities\u2014but parts. Submarines are extraordinarily complex, requiring components in a lengthy supply chain. It takes years to procure the specific undersea sensors, fire-control systems and other crucial internal parts for each boat.<br/>\nThe problem requires not only more spending but also greater creativity, since the fleet will shrink until the 2030s. As America\u2019s undersea advantage narrows, a Chinese attack becomes more probable. If China can knock out an American yard through cyber means, sabotage or even direct assault, then U.S. backlogs will mushroom, cutting the submarine force to 10 or 20 boats and tilting the balance in China\u2019s favor.<br/>\nOne short-term solution is procuring conventionally powered submarines, a step the U.S. hasn\u2019t taken since the middle of the Cold War.

We must stand with the Ukrainian people until victory is won,\u201d the statement said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>This will be a key leverage if McCarthy needs the votes from his Democratic colleagues to survive a motion to vacate vote.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Interesting speculation from CNN that a deal for Ukraine aid bill for support during a motion to vacate. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/government-shutdown-deadline-09-30-23/h_46d149160dc98a0a885632a80e09fc84\">https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/government-shutdown-deadline-09-30-23/h_46d149160dc98a0a885632a80e09fc84</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Colorado Democrat Michael Bennet told reporters that there will be a statement on US commitment to Ukraine soon, which was exactly what he had hoped to see when he objected on the stopgap bill to keep the government open. The bill does not include new aid for Ukraine.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;What I asked for exactly was a statement from leadership, a bipartisan statement from the leadership, and that&#39;s what we&#39;re gonna get,&quot; the senator told reporters.</p>\n\n<p>He said he had signaled he would slow consideration of the spending bill &quot;in the hope that when we get into the discussion in the second round here, that we&#39;ve all thought about just as how important this is. We can&#39;t fail here.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Bennet added, &quot;These votes on Ukraine are beyond politics and our responsibility as a nation here is beyond politics.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Both Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell spoke about supporting Ukraine during remarks on the Senate floor earlier.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So it looks like movement in both chambers towards a separate Ukraine aid bill. Last reports were that it would be paired with border security money.</p>\n</div>",

            "body": "The fundamental flaw in your argument is a common one: that you counter a piece of equipment with a like-piece of equipment. That if one side has a carrier, you counter the other side with a carrier.\n\nYou don't. You can sink a carrier with a myriad number of ways: a submarine, for one. And unlike WWII, where aircraft were the longest reaching weapons available to a surface fleet, we live in the age of guided missiles, hypersonic glide vehicles, etc.\n\nThe Type 055 Renhai cruiser, for instance, carries the YJ-18 anti-ship cruise missile, and the YJ-21 anti-ship ballistic missile. You don't need an aircraft carrier to sink another aircraft carrier - if a Renhai gets in range of a CVN and launches its missiles, the CVN is going to have to hope its strike group's defenses hold up.\n\nYou're also forgetting that a carrier's capability is entirely based on its aircraft. A modern surface combatant is a floating / moving IADS that can put out far more radar power and bristles with more sensors than a land based IADS. If anyone thinks sinking a modern surface combatant is easy, they couldn't be more off base.\n\nThis is doubly so if the enemy surface combatant is operating under the cover of friendly aircraft (land or carrier-based), of which most of the scenarios against China involves fighting them within range of their land-based fighters.\n\nSo in that regard, China has the ultimate aircraft carrier: a massive unsinkable one.\n\nAdd to the fact that China has [multiple layers of anti-ship missiles (ballistic or otherwise)](https://www.thedrive.com/content-b/message-editor%2F1605564187431-range-rings.jpg) - and that you have to get your carriers *in range* to launch your aircraft, while accepting that even a lucky hit from an enemy weapon can incapacitate a ship (or up to kill 5,000 American sailors), and the problem is not simple or straightforward.\n\nPlus, the longer range you go, the less forces you can bring to bear. China alone flew over 100 aircraft around Taiwan recently - in peace. \n\nAn aircraft carrier carries ~50 fighters (plus Growlers) - of which a chunk will be down for routine maintenance. Then you need tankers - even if you look at the published F-35C max range of ~670 mile combat radius, you'd need multiple tankers (either organic from the carrier or from Air Force land-based ones) to get any considerable force the thousands of miles required to get to Taiwan if you are honoring the above weapons.\n\nCoordinating tankers across a geographically distributed region is not easy. This  makes the challenge for us a lot more complex/harder than if we could simply launch from land and fight 100-200 miles off our coast. \n\nAnd all this is happening under the largest space-based ISR network in the world that isn't the US's.\n\nThe [2022 unclassified DOD report on the PLA](https://www.defense.gov/CMPR/), which is a wealth of information on anyone who actually wants insight straight from the DOD, had this to say:\n\n>At the end of 2021, China's ISR satellite fleet contained more than 260 systems \u2013 a quantity second only to the United States, and nearly doubling China's in-orbit systems since 2018. The PLA owns and operates about half of the world's ISR systems\n\nIf you look at the NASIC (National Air and Space Intelligence Center) report from [2018 on space based systems](https://www.nasic.af.mil/Portals/19/documents/Space_Glossy_FINAL--15Jan_Single_Page.pdf?ver=2019-01-23-150035-697), you can see the number of ISR satellites that each country had.\n\nIn 2018:\n\n* United States - 353\n* China - 122\n* Russia - 23\n* Rest of World - 168\n\nYes, that's not a typo: Russia had all of TWENTY THREE ISR satellites. Even back in 2018, China had over five time as many ISR satellites as Russia (and you bet most were a lot newer/more modern). In the past 3-4 years, China has more than doubled its ISR satellite count from 122 to 260, if you compare the DOD report to NASIC's 2018 numbers. So those are definitely all new systems with more recent technology\n\nOne other point to consider, since you are writing about bringing 6+ USN carriers online at a time to fight, is that these carriers all need to be resupplied ever week or two to sustain combat operations. You run out of munitions, jet fuel, etc. \n\nHaving six carriers spread out over thousands of miles of the Pacific is a massive logistical challenge. This isn't like us sitting in the Persian Gulf or North Arabian Sea, as we did for the past 20+ years, where ships could go between Bahrain and a carrier every other day if we wanted - and do it unharassed.\n\nLastly, as I wrote elsehwere, we only have 9 carrier air wings (CVW 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, and 17). These carrier air wings also go through various maintenance phases, like ships. \n\nEven if you assumed all stops were pulled out, that all these air wings were magically available and operating full up, the US is still going to be wary to commit all 9 at once. We'd want to keep forces in reserve, we'd have to send less-proficient air wings to training (those in maintenance phases aren't going to be proficient as one that has gone through pre-deployment workups, for instance) before committing them, etc.\n\nSo even if you assumed we had 9 CVW's on hand, and we assumed all 44 fighters + 5-7 Growlers per air wing were 100% healthy and ready (and not down for maintenance, etc.), you'd be committing at most 450 fighters total from 9 carriers. Of which a chunk will be tanker-configured F/A-18s - and that chunk will be bigger if Air Force land-based tankers can't rendezvous with our 9 different carrier strike packages. And that strike could probably happen once to twice a day given the long flight distances required to cover and reconfigure all the jets after a mission given what you'd be committing (there are a million other considerations I won't even cover here, this is all just \"in theory\" maximum forces committable at a time, which is not necessarily how we'd want to fight)\n\nAll of that to face an enemy with floating IADS under the cover of their land-based air defenses and other A2/AD forces - and enemy air cover.\n\nNotably, I NEVER once mentioned enemy aircraft carriers. Because the war isn't going to be about fighting enemy aircraft carriers. It's about all the other stuff we have to crack in a modern naval war that has never been fought before, so any past assumptions are at best assumptions. Again, this isn't WW2 anymore - you don't need a carrier-based reconnaissance plane to find an enemy carrier - you have ISR available elsewhere. You don't need a carrier-based fighter to reach out and touch an enemy carrier.\n\nAgain, this isn't platform versus platform. It's system of systems versus system of systems. China's Navy isn't operating alone (nor is the US Navy). China's Navy is operating with a large ISR network. Their ships are bristling with air defenses to deny our carriers their main punch and to defend their invasion forces, while air cover comes from land-based fighters of which they have thousands. \n\nLooking at ship versus ship, or even fighter versus fighter (like the F-35 vs. J-20 conversations that get brought up daily), is a common mistake observers make. That's not at all how wars - especially modern wars with modern technology with modern networking - works.",
