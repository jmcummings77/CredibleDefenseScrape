The point of this is to highlight why a lot of people in the defense world rolls their eyes at the attempts to compare China to Russia, especially based on Russian struggles in Ukraine.\n\nThe [2022 unclassified DOD report on the PLA](https://www.defense.gov/CMPR/), which is a wealth of information on anyone who actually wants insight straight from the DOD, had this to say:\n\n>At the end of 2021, China's ISR satellite fleet contained more than 260 systems \u2013 a quantity second only to the United States, and nearly doubling China's in-orbit systems since 2018. The PLA owns and operates about half of the world's ISR systems\n\nIf you look at the NASIC (National Air and Space Intelligence Center) report from [2018 on space based systems](https://www.nasic.af.mil/Portals/19/documents/Space_Glossy_FINAL--15Jan_Single_Page.pdf?ver=2019-01-23-150035-697), you can see the number of ISR satellites that each country had.\n\nIn 2018:\n\n* United States - 353\n* China - 122\n* Russia - 23\n* Rest of World - 168\n\nYes, that's not a typo: Russia had all of TWENTY THREE ISR satellites. Even back in 2018, China had over five time as many ISR satellites as Russia (and you bet most were a lot newer/more modern)\n\nIn the past 3-4 years, China has more than doubled its ISR satellite count from 122 to 260, if you compare the DOD report to NASIC's 2018 numbers. So those are definitely all new systems with more recent technology\n\nThat's an absolutely astounding increase in number, and that pace is why defense officials keep talking about China as the \"pacing threat\" - because that pace is something we need to be very wary of, since it is happening across a lot of fields.\n\nThe ISR satellites is just one example, but it's a good example of why in the defense world, Russia isn't even remotely treated as being in the same sphere as China when it comes to most military capabilities. Their lack of money and industrial/tech base and subsequent their lack of investment in all the other non-sexy things that wins wars is showing. It's never about the specific tanks or planes or missiles, but all the systems combined that make kill chains work and give your decision makers the best situational awareness to smartly win wars. \n\nAnd in that regard, it's the US and China playing in a different league from the rest of the entire world",

The 30 mm is also of more utility versus anything that's not tracked but still can put down a lot of hurt, like the BTR series.

It's old, but it's probably been missed.\n\n\nhttps://archive.ph/SEkTZ#selection-1885.0-1896.0\n\n>Curiously, the Army's 2024 missile procurement budget doesn't include any Switchblades. One reason may be their price. Each Switchblade costs $58,000, though defense writer David Hambling estimates the true cost at about $80,000 apiece. But Ukraine is launching swarms of militarized commercial drones that cost a few hundred dollars each. Even if some are shot down or disrupted by Russian jamming, economics favor the cheaper drone.\n\n>The Low Altitude Stalking and Strike Ordnance program aims to develop a lightweight weapon that can be carried by soldiers in the Army's Infantry Brigade Combat Teams.\nKnown as LASSO, the weapon will be \"a man-portable, tube launched, lethal payload munition,\" according to an announcement by the Army's Program Executive Office Soldier. \"It includes electrical optical/infrared sensor, precision flight control, and the ability to fly, track and engage non-line-of-sight targets and armored vehicles with precision lethal fires. LASSO currently consists of three modules: the launch tube, unmanned aerial system, and fire control station.\"\nIn a sign of how seriously the Army is taking this project, LASSO has been deemed an urgent capability acquisition, a Department of Defense procedure designed to deliver new systems to the field in less than two years. \n\nI hope they get it out soon. It's sorta embarrassing that the US doesn't have a lancet equivalent. I do agree the SB600 is far too expensive, when FPV drones have taken out tanks. Then again, the US hasn't produced a general purpose recon drone on mass yet either....",

It&#39;s old, but it&#39;s probably been missed.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://archive.ph/SEkTZ#selection-1885.0-1896.0\">https://archive.ph/SEkTZ#selection-1885.0-1896.0</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Curiously, the Army&#39;s 2024 missile procurement budget doesn&#39;t include any Switchblades. One reason may be their price. Each Switchblade costs $58,000, though defense writer David Hambling estimates the true cost at about $80,000 apiece. But Ukraine is launching swarms of militarized commercial drones that cost a few hundred dollars each. Even if some are shot down or disrupted by Russian jamming, economics favor the cheaper drone.</p>\n\n<p>The Low Altitude Stalking and Strike Ordnance program aims to develop a lightweight weapon that can be carried by soldiers in the Army&#39;s Infantry Brigade Combat Teams.\nKnown as LASSO, the weapon will be &quot;a man-portable, tube launched, lethal payload munition,&quot; according to an announcement by the Army&#39;s Program Executive Office Soldier. &quot;It includes electrical optical/infrared sensor, precision flight control, and the ability to fly, track and engage non-line-of-sight targets and armored vehicles with precision lethal fires. LASSO currently consists of three modules: the launch tube, unmanned aerial system, and fire control station.&quot;\nIn a sign of how seriously the Army is taking this project, LASSO has been deemed an urgent capability acquisition, a Department of Defense procedure designed to deliver new systems to the field in less than two years. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I hope they get it out soon. It&#39;s sorta embarrassing that the US doesn&#39;t have a lancet equivalent. I do agree the SB600 is far too expensive, when FPV drones have taken out tanks. Then again, the US hasn&#39;t produced a general purpose recon drone on mass yet either....</p>\n</div>",

The rotary wing quad-copters are much more flexible from a loitering perspective, in that they can hover or go slow to aid in target acquisition. What we've seen a lot is the Ukrainians and Russians use a recon drone to detect the target and then vector in the kamikaze drone. The field-of-view on the kamikaze drone cameras is pretty limited, so they are vectored onto the target via communication with the recon drone operator. I suspect what the USA wants now, is an automated software solution where the recon drone can give the kamikaze drone both a GPS target location and an approach trajectory that isn't impeded by terrain. The kamikaze drone operator then could be guided in, just like poor weather landing systems for aircraft.\n\nThe problem reminds me of the issue of \"capture\" of ATGMs after launch. Man-portable ATGMs like the Dragon that didn't have a soft-launch system were very hard to guide at a target _under_ 1000 m because the concussion and smoke/dust from the launch both stunned and blinded the gunner. Similarly a loitering drone with a small field-of-view camera that can't slow down to search for the target is going to put a lot of stress on the operator's skills, because the time between the target being a pixel and the drone detonating is very short. The system needs software integration with reconnaissance drones to get it on target.",

How many Patriots were fired versus Kinzhal's fired? \n\n>then it must be that Russia\u2019s tests at Mach 5 failed and they had to slow the missile down so that they could use it in Ukraine. Anyway that was my take away from current events. Hypersonics tests fail because the glide vehicle fails to sustain the faster speeds and remain operational. So in my opinion the Kinzhal is insufficiently tested.\n\nOr, the Kinzhal was nothing more than a hyped-up-by-Russia (like they hype up their Armata, Su-57, etc.) ballistic missile that flies a predictable profile?\n\nYou're not wrong that they probably also didn't test it - Russia doesn't have the Soviet Union's economic base, military industrial complex, or science and technology foundation. That means they don't have the money to thoroughly test their systems, produce a lot of it, and keep developing new systems. Even mundane things - like having insufficient hypersonic wind tunnels - limits how much they can test/do at a time. \n\nWhich makes your original post about how China is more of the same all that more ridiculous, given that China has an industrial base larger than anyone else in the world, has a massive science and technology sector that spans a lot of industries (from consumer goods to military hardware), and builds a shit ton of military equipment that is rapidly being iterated on and developed across a wide spectrum of systems.\n\nAnother example: in that same report, it states:\n\n>At the end of 2021, China's ISR satellite fleet contained more than 260 systems \u2013 a quantity second only to the United States, and nearly doubling China's in-orbit systems since 2018\n\n>The PLA owns and operates about half of the world's space-based ISR systems.\n\nNow you can read the 2018 report from NASIC [National Air and Space Intelligence Center](https://www.nasic.af.mil/Portals/19/documents/Space_Glossy_FINAL--15Jan_Single_Page.pdf?ver=2019-01-23-150035-697):\n\nIn 2018, the US had 353 satellites for ISR. China had 122.\n\nSo no shit, in the last 5 years, China has more than doubled its ISR satellite count (the rest of the world that wasn't US/China/Russia in 2018 had 168... so it's safe to say now China has more than the rest of the non-US world combined)\n\nGuess how many Russia had in 2018?\n\n23 - yes, that's not a typo: TWENTY THREE\n\nRussia isn't even remotely in the sphere of China when it comes to military capability and capacity, so your original post trying to compare the two - especially basing it on Russia's own failures in warfighting in Ukraine - doesn't even pass the basic sniff test given how disparate the two are",

So in my opinion the Kinzhal is insufficiently tested.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Or, the Kinzhal was nothing more than a hyped-up-by-Russia (like they hype up their Armata, Su-57, etc.) ballistic missile that flies a predictable profile?</p>\n\n<p>You&#39;re not wrong that they probably also didn&#39;t test it - Russia doesn&#39;t have the Soviet Union&#39;s economic base, military industrial complex, or science and technology foundation. That means they don&#39;t have the money to thoroughly test their systems, produce a lot of it, and keep developing new systems. Even mundane things - like having insufficient hypersonic wind tunnels - limits how much they can test/do at a time. </p>\n\n<p>Which makes your original post about how China is more of the same all that more ridiculous, given that China has an industrial base larger than anyone else in the world, has a massive science and technology sector that spans a lot of industries (from consumer goods to military hardware), and builds a shit ton of military equipment that is rapidly being iterated on and developed across a wide spectrum of systems.</p>\n\n<p>Another example: in that same report, it states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>At the end of 2021, China&#39;s ISR satellite fleet contained more than 260 systems \u2013 a quantity second only to the United States, and nearly doubling China&#39;s in-orbit systems since 2018</p>\n\n<p>The PLA owns and operates about half of the world&#39;s space-based ISR systems.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now you can read the 2018 report from NASIC <a href=\"https://www.nasic.af.mil/Portals/19/documents/Space_Glossy_FINAL--15Jan_Single_Page.pdf?ver=2019-01-23-150035-697\">National Air and Space Intelligence Center</a>:</p>\n\n<p>In 2018, the US had 353 satellites for ISR. China had 122.</p>\n\n<p>So no shit, in the last 5 years, China has more than doubled its ISR satellite count (the rest of the world that wasn&#39;t US/China/Russia in 2018 had 168... so it&#39;s safe to say now China has more than the rest of the non-US world combined)</p>\n\n<p>Guess how many Russia had in 2018?</p>\n\n<p>23 - yes, that&#39;s not a typo: TWENTY THREE</p>\n\n<p>Russia isn&#39;t even remotely in the sphere of China when it comes to military capability and capacity, so your original post trying to compare the two - especially basing it on Russia&#39;s own failures in warfighting in Ukraine - doesn&#39;t even pass the basic sniff test given how disparate the two are</p>\n</div>",
