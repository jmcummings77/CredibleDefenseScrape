Of course China only tried to imperialize and conquer a few of its neighbors, it had only so many neighbors and was too incapable of doing more than that and certainly attempted to and succeeded at imperializing its neighbors whenever it could. And every other place it succeeded for a significant period of time it was sinicized. Korea, Vietnam, Turkish, Tibet, India, Haishenwai regions are the Northeast, Southeast, and Western parts of its borders. That's more than 240 degrees out of 360 degrees of its borders and thats not even counting Taiwan. But yeah Chinese myopic view was that these were isolated incidents and not a imperial foreign policy. Same as its preposterous claims to the entirety of the South China Sea, simply redefine what is historically theirs constantly and it'll always be fair game. Just like the way they call themselves a whole process 'democracy'. Or 'socialism' with Chinese characteristics.\n\nAgain, ask the people of Vietnam how they feel about Chinese imperialism, they know that they've been in conflict with China attempting to conquer them for centuries. Lack of capability does not mean lack of ambition. The only reason the Vietnamese and Koreans are a separate ethnicity today are because of their stubborn refusal to be sinicized by the Chinese empire. The fact that Chinese people like you can't come to terms with your own history shows the lack of China's ability to ever take a bigger role in international affairs. And I say this as a Chinese person.\n\nJust like Chinese imperial ambitions of Taiwan for almost a century. The only legitimate claim it has on it is based on the Qing, a literal failing empire its own country despises for being so weak. And yet its been incapable of conquering for over 70 years. Yet it just keeps claiming it owns Taiwan despite having multiple generations pass it without ever actually accomplishing anything. The only claim China has to anything is to keep redefining what is historical claims, no wonder no one takes it seriously.",

Back when the US pulled the exact stunt with Maduro, Maduro could have probably responded by rousing up several thousand \"protestors\" to storm the embassy.

        "body": "CCP Stealth War 146; Feature: Parsing China\u2019s Agenda for Ukraine Peace Talks\n\n\nhttps://jamestown.org/program/ccp-stealth-war-146-feature-parsing-chinas-agenda-for-ukraine-peace-talks/\n\n\n[Unusual Implications for China\u2019s Typhoon-Buffeted Agricultural Sector]\n\nWhile parts of China have been\u00a0suffering\u00a0under severe droughts over the last few years, the recent one-two punch of Typhoons\u00a0Doksuri\u00a0in late July and\u00a0Khanun\u00a0in early August have caused significant damage to the agricultural sector of some of China\u2019s most productive regions. In particular, the northern provinces of the \u201cGolden Corn Belt\u201d (Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Outer Mongolia)\u00a0are expected\u00a0to produce millions of tons less of corn, wheat, soybeans, and rice than they normally do. This, combined with several international factors, may cause a rise in food prices in China and in the global markets more broadly\u2014which may paradoxically benefit the CCP domestically, as it struggles to fight deflationary pressures.\n\nWhile Xi Jinping has argued for China\u2019s eventual independence in the area of foodstuffs (elevating it as a key goal for the PRC in the medium run, alongside the\u00a0protection and expansion\u00a0of agriculturally productive land), China is still a long ways off from being self-sufficient. Up until recently, Chinese imports of rice, particularly from India, were\u00a0rising\u00a0by more than 50 percent each year. In the first three quarters of 2022, 40.4 percent of China\u2019s rice imports\u00a0came\u00a0from India\u2014mostly in the form of \u201cbroken rice,\u201d which is generally used as a cheap feed for livestock. To overcome domestic shortages, however, India\u00a0banned\u00a0the export of broken rice in September 2022; in July 2023, New Delhi went even further,\u00a0banning\u00a0the export of all non-basmati rice. This reduced Indian rice exports by half, which\u2014given that India was the largest global exporter of rice until then\u2014is\u00a0expected\u00a0to have a major knock-on effect on global rice prices.\n\nMuch of China\u2019s domestic and imported agricultural products are used to feed its burgeoning livestock population, particularly its pork industry; pork\u00a0accounts\u00a0for some 60 percent of all meat consumed in China. As prices have shifted, so too has the production of China\u2019s various feeds, which\u00a0is generally\u00a0the most expensive part of raising pigs. Corn\u00a0overtook\u00a0rice production in raw tonnage in 2013, but corn growing is still much less\u00a0productive\u00a0as an industry than its American counterpart is, due largely to the latter\u2019s use of genetically modified organisms (GMO). This lack of productivity,\u00a0combined\u00a0with the aforementioned droughts in China\u2019s best areas for corn growing has raised prices, which pushed Chinese farmers to\u00a0focus\u00a0on the growing of grains instead, namely wheat. Grain production in China\u00a0suffers\u00a0from many of the same issues that the corn sector does. While wheat harvests\u00a0have\u00a0grown over the last few years, their increase year-over-year has been\u00a0lackluster, owing among other things to unfavorable weather conditions.\n\nAs a result of the three main kinds of feed becoming harder and/or more expensive to produce domestically, one would expect that the price of livestock (again, namely pork) would have skyrocketed as a result. Instead, at the start of 2023 the price\u00a0crashed\u00a0by some 25 percent. This may be explained in part by three main factors: a) a growing reliance on\u00a0imports; b) the opening of strategic reserves set aside by the PRC to stabilize prices; and c) a collapse in overall demand.\n\nWhile the import of most agricultural goods has increased on the whole, the price of importing rice, corn, and grains have all been elevated due to international issues: India\u2019s ban on rice exports, the ongoing war against Ukraine and the\u00a0collapse\u00a0of the \u201cGrain Deal\u201d between Russia and Ukraine, etc. This has been offset somewhat by the PRC\u2019s efforts to broaden the list of countries it imports from, to include\u00a0Brazil\u00a0and\u00a0South Africa. China\u2014albeit reluctantly\u2014continues to\u00a0rely\u00a0on the US for the import of many foodstuffs, even as it regards this fact as a geopolitical risk.\n\nWhile Beijing may have released parts of its foodstuff\u00a0reserves, any such efforts are likely to have been in the form of food aid to provinces affected by the recent natural disasters, rather than a broader stabilization of the feed market.\n\nMore relevant to the situation is the general decline in Chinese demand for meat, which follows the logic of a population cutting back on luxuries as the state of the Chinese economy becomes more negative. In 2023, the PRC\u00a0entered\u00a0its first period of deflation\u00a0since\u00a0the COVID-19 outbreak. This was driven in no small part by the aforementioned 25 percent decrease in the price of pork, which composes the largest individual share of any item in China\u2019s consumer price index (CPI), at roughly 3 percent.\n\nOne may gather that the CCP is seriously concerned about inflation, given that it has\u00a0restricted\u00a0the nation\u2019s economists from even mentioning the concept when discussing the current economic situation.

In particular, the northern provinces of the \u201cGolden Corn Belt\u201d (Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Outer Mongolia)\u00a0are expected\u00a0to produce millions of tons less of corn, wheat, soybeans, and rice than they normally do. This, combined with several international factors, may cause a rise in food prices in China and in the global markets more broadly\u2014which may paradoxically benefit the CCP domestically, as it struggles to fight deflationary pressures.</p>\n\n<p>While Xi Jinping has argued for China\u2019s eventual independence in the area of foodstuffs (elevating it as a key goal for the PRC in the medium run, alongside the\u00a0protection and expansion\u00a0of agriculturally productive land), China is still a long ways off from being self-sufficient. Up until recently, Chinese imports of rice, particularly from India, were\u00a0rising\u00a0by more than 50 percent each year. In the first three quarters of 2022, 40.4 percent of China\u2019s rice imports\u00a0came\u00a0from India\u2014mostly in the form of \u201cbroken rice,\u201d which is generally used as a cheap feed for livestock. To overcome domestic shortages, however, India\u00a0banned\u00a0the export of broken rice in September 2022; in July 2023, New Delhi went even further,\u00a0banning\u00a0the export of all non-basmati rice. This reduced Indian rice exports by half, which\u2014given that India was the largest global exporter of rice until then\u2014is\u00a0expected\u00a0to have a major knock-on effect on global rice prices.</p>\n\n<p>Much of China\u2019s domestic and imported agricultural products are used to feed its burgeoning livestock population, particularly its pork industry; pork\u00a0accounts\u00a0for some 60 percent of all meat consumed in China. As prices have shifted, so too has the production of China\u2019s various feeds, which\u00a0is generally\u00a0the most expensive part of raising pigs. Corn\u00a0overtook\u00a0rice production in raw tonnage in 2013, but corn growing is still much less\u00a0productive\u00a0as an industry than its American counterpart is, due largely to the latter\u2019s use of genetically modified organisms (GMO). This lack of productivity,\u00a0combined\u00a0with the aforementioned droughts in China\u2019s best areas for corn growing has raised prices, which pushed Chinese farmers to\u00a0focus\u00a0on the growing of grains instead, namely wheat. Grain production in China\u00a0suffers\u00a0from many of the same issues that the corn sector does. While wheat harvests\u00a0have\u00a0grown over the last few years, their increase year-over-year has been\u00a0lackluster, owing among other things to unfavorable weather conditions.</p>\n\n<p>As a result of the three main kinds of feed becoming harder and/or more expensive to produce domestically, one would expect that the price of livestock (again, namely pork) would have skyrocketed as a result. Instead, at the start of 2023 the price\u00a0crashed\u00a0by some 25 percent. This may be explained in part by three main factors: a) a growing reliance on\u00a0imports; b) the opening of strategic reserves set aside by the PRC to stabilize prices; and c) a collapse in overall demand.</p>\n\n<p>While the import of most agricultural goods has increased on the whole, the price of importing rice, corn, and grains have all been elevated due to international issues: India\u2019s ban on rice exports, the ongoing war against Ukraine and the\u00a0collapse\u00a0of the \u201cGrain Deal\u201d between Russia and Ukraine, etc. This has been offset somewhat by the PRC\u2019s efforts to broaden the list of countries it imports from, to include\u00a0Brazil\u00a0and\u00a0South Africa. China\u2014albeit reluctantly\u2014continues to\u00a0rely\u00a0on the US for the import of many foodstuffs, even as it regards this fact as a geopolitical risk.</p>\n\n<p>While Beijing may have released parts of its foodstuff\u00a0reserves, any such efforts are likely to have been in the form of food aid to provinces affected by the recent natural disasters, rather than a broader stabilization of the feed market.</p>\n\n<p>More relevant to the situation is the general decline in Chinese demand for meat, which follows the logic of a population cutting back on luxuries as the state of the Chinese economy becomes more negative. In 2023, the PRC\u00a0entered\u00a0its first period of deflation\u00a0since\u00a0the COVID-19 outbreak. This was driven in no small part by the aforementioned 25 percent decrease in the price of pork, which composes the largest individual share of any item in China\u2019s consumer price index (CPI), at roughly 3 percent.</p>\n\n<p>One may gather that the CCP is seriously concerned about inflation, given that it has\u00a0restricted\u00a0the nation\u2019s economists from even mentioning the concept when discussing the current economic situation. While the various international pressures regarding global agricultural prices suggest a destabilizing increase for much of the third world, this may be welcomed by some in Beijing as a way of restoring healthy inflation\u2014and fending off\u00a0suggestions\u00a0that the PRC may be entering a Japan-like era of economic stagnation.</p>\n</div>",

The aim is maximise capital participation.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The structure calls for the fund to use the lower-cost public money, known as concessional capital, to make initial investments and absorb the first losses.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe notion is that this initial seed capital would be a de-risking mechanism, and it would create the potential for private sector capital to come in at scale,\u201d said Brandon Hall, co-head of BlackRock\u2019s Financial Markets Advisory arm. \u201cUkraine will have its own organisation to source and syndicate these local investment opportunities.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>To overcome investor concerns about governance, the fund is expected to stock its board with representatives of international financial institutions and governments and hire investment professionals to execute its strategy.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOur view is that if you have a strong governance structure and an internationally credible set of stakeholders who are in the leadership position in this fund, then that will go a long way,\u201d Hall said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Look at the argument about the claim of a 3 year development time for the AIM-120D. u/Angry_Citizen_CoH claims three years, probably because that's what [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIM-120_AMRAAM) says. The Wikipedia source claims, \"\\[...\\] the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase completed in September 2009.\" What is EMD? According to [DAU (EMD Phase)](https://aaf.dau.edu/aaf/mca/emd-phase/) it means, \"The EMD phase will end when the design is stable; the system meets validated capability requirements demonstrated by developmental, live fire (as appropriate), and early operational testing; \\[...\\]\". So it's reasonable on that basis to say the missile development only took three years. Except the cited source seems noncredible.\n\nIs there a credible source? Yes, the DOT&E 2011 AMRAAM program summary [here](https://www.dote.osd.mil/Portals/97/pub/reports/FY2011/af/2011amraam.pdf?ver=2019-08-22-112332-143). There it states operational testing did indeed stop in 2009 - because the missile had engineering problems. The DOT&E 2015 update states testing was completed in July 2014.\n\nYes, u/FoxThreeForDale is correct that development for the AIM-120D lasted longer than 3 years. But they're not correct because their source is better. Their linked document is an acquisitions document listing what are most likely payment milestones for the project. It is not an engineering document. It's not clear whether those program milestones reflect the expected, realistic timeline for missile development based on initial contract milestones or whether it's just when money actually got disbursed. Although the document has some program details, it's mostly about program costs. Further it's a 51-page document with some obvious errors and a focus on ongoing procurement projects. The initial AIM-120D procurement was finished by that point (2018) so I doubt whether the junior officer or civilian employee who generated the report ever verified any of the old dates.\n\nCould the AIM-120D have been engineered in 3 years start to finish? I don't know. It's not my field. But let's be honest, it's not really u/FoxThreeForDale 's field either it seems. They seem to have technical user knowledge and program knowledge of missile systems. They probably have a technical degree. And I expect they've sat in many meetings with a lot of Raytheon engineers. But I think they are overselling their user / program knowledge as engineering and technical knowledge, and are ok with obfuscating the difference behind a wall of text rudely excoriating everyone else as ignorant and less intelligent. It doesn't take technical expertise to condescendingly rant that missile development is complex and then have a shot in hell of being right about it.\n\nIn summary, being correct doesn't mean being credible, as was the case here. It would have been good to see a more credible exchange in these threads and here in general. Yet most days the actual credible, relevant info in the megathread could be summarized in a paragraph.",

Missiles need to be thought of as planes, because they have to deal with a lot of the same issues as aircraft development (structures, motors, avionics, sensors, etc.) so it is NOT a trivial endeavor. Even AIM-9X took the better part of the entire 90s, and the AIM-120D took almost all of the 2000s - and the D shares the same shape as the C.\n\nThe article actually states:\n\n>Ukraine will receive a new variant of the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile in three to five years, according to weapons-builder Raytheon Technologies.\n\n>Raytheon completed its first flight test in June of the latest variant of the missile, called AIM-120C-8, Paul Ferraro, president of Air Power at Raytheon, told reporters Thursday. The missile was fired from an F-15C Eagle at Eglin Air Force Base.\n\n>The next-gen AMRAAMs are \u201cwildly different, both hardware-wise and software-wise,\u201d than the current missile, Ferraro said. \n\nAnd\n\n>The company recently finished redesigning the missile\u2014upgrading multiple circuit cards and advanced processors in the guidance section of the missile\u2014an effort called the \u201cForm, Fit, Function refresh,\u201d or F3R. **The international variant of the missile, AIM-120C-8,** and the domestic variant, AIM-120D-3, were both part of F3R.\n\n>The new international variant \u201cwill largely largely replace that inventory that's being depleted as they send those to Ukraine,\u201d Ferraro said.\n\nIt's a bit confusing how they word it, but the AIM-120C8, like the AIM-120D3, have different hardware (in part to replace parts that are no longer in production) and software (for the new hardware) from their predecessors, but are fundamentally the same bodies. They're called F3R hardware because of \"form, fit, function, refresh\" because they are literally replacing existing parts with newer in-production parts that have to meet exact same form, fit, and **function** of their predecessor missiles \n\nNotably, the article also highlights AIM-120C8 as the INTERNATIONAL variant - so it is distinct and separate from AIM-120D - which isn't entirely accurate either, given that the RAAF have AIM-120D as well, so AIM-120D is not strictly domestic. No, I won't get into any the specifics of C's and D's.\n\nSo in sum, between your two articles, there's absolutely nothing about Ukraine getting AIM-120D's. In fact, it's distinctly the opposite: Ukraine says they're getting a modified missile, and the Raytheon piece is talking about the international variant, the C8, finishing flight test and possibly being sent in 3-5 years.

You can even look at the <a href=\"https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/FOID/Reading%20Room/Selected_Acquisition_Reports/FY_2018_SARS/19-F-1098_DOC_14_AMRAAM_SAR_Dec_2018.pdf\">Selected Acquisition Report on AIM-120</a>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Contract Award - Jan 2004</li>\n<li>Functional Configuration Audit - Sep 2009</li>\n<li>Full Production Go Ahead - Jan 2015</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Regarding JATM, that is all acquisitions terminology anwyays, as a Milestone C decision is no indication on how much development is left on a viable product. What&#39;s the actual IOC date of JATM again? Do you know how many shots they have successfully taken? What actual capabilities the initial production missiles have and where they are going?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>There&#39;s absolutely no need to come at people so harshly. Do you have experience with missile development? I do. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes, I&#39;m in flight test and have shot a lot of these missiles being talked about. I even know when the origins of the JATM program started (and not just when the contract was awarded). How about you?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Talking a ten year turnaround for a variant on an existing missile is far, far off-base.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The new variants Raytheon have pitched are significantly different and require significantly more flight test. They don&#39;t even have anything beyond mock ups.</p>\n\n<p>edit: lol at people who downvote what they don&#39;t like to hear. The guy is literally posting false shit, but you guys are seriously eating it up? The Selected Acquisition Report literally is telling everyone this dude is a liar. But the guy says it takes 3 years and you all believe it because it fits your hopes? Good fucking God reddit.</p>\n</div>",

Mark Galeotti makes the point that the current generation of Russian leadership is stuck in the anti west cold war mindset, so they don&#39;t view china as a threat but that the next generation shows far more concern for the growing power of china, (and as my comment - one that has lost territory to Russia).</p>\n\n<p>Another thing to consider is that if the war becomes destructive enough to Russia (such as in your hypothetical loss), it may result in the discrediting of the expansionist ideology, at least for a time, which could facilitate an easier reorientation.</p>\n\n<p>Finally there is no going back to business as usual in the short term with Russia, irrespective of the outcome.

Wouldn\u2019t the 300,000 mobilized in October 2022 be part of the currently estimated 250,000 Russians he estimated as fight ready at the start of the counteroffensive?</p>\n\n<p>Second, how are Ukrainian mobilization efforts looking?
