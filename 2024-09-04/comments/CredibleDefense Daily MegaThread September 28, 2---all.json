The news was then denied by Podolyak. \n\nhttps://t. me/M_Podolyak/157\n\nI would like to take advantage of this, thanks to the new datas, to reopen the debate about the losses in the Bakhmut campaign and the opportunities of that campaign for both the sides, referencing to the military history of the events and their consequences (warning: wall of text!).\n\nAs for the \"return of Wagner\": in the southern flank of Bakhmut there's, for example, PMC Hispaniola, a battalion composed largely of hooligans with close ties to Wagner. I believe that any news reporting about Wagner's returning to Bakhmut could probably refer to former Wagner professionals who signed contracts with the MoD and joined \"legalized\" PMCs such as the former. Others joined PMC Redut, framed in the \"Cossack Volunteer Assault Corps\". But Wagner as a stand-alone entity, as we've known it during the winter, should be gone. And Wagner, via Grey Zone, criticizes its former soldiers who sign contracts with other units, reminding that Wagner became what it had become because of its (now dead) leaders and a cadre of experienced officers who led the subunits.\n\nhttps://t. me/grey_zone/20800\n\nA few days ago, pictures of the new memorial dedicated to Wagnerites fallen in action were published. Both professionals and convicts - I find it very likely it includes MIAs. \n\nhttps://t. me/grey_zone/20733\n\nPer Grey Zone, i.e. PMC Wagner's official communication channel, it contains more than 25'000 names (okay, dog tags actually) of \"every fallen Wagnerite\". Thus the statements from Prigozhin in late May and from a Wagner officer back in July would find confirmation:\n\n* 78'000 people have been part of the Wagner Group since the beginning of the invasion \n* 22'000 of these fell in action as of May 20, the day Bakhmut was officially taken\n* 40'000 of these were wounded, a figure that obviously ranges from the maimed to the slightly wounded\n* of the 78'000, 49'000 were the convicts who chose to join Wagner\n* the convicts would have suffered 15'000 KIAs and 25'000 WIAs\n* as a result, the professionals would have recorded, from February 2022 to May 2023, 7'000 KIAs and 15'000 WIAs\n* at the time of Wagner's withdrawal from Ukraine, 10'000 went to Belarus while 15'000 (largely, I assume, former convicts) were discharged\n\nhttps://t. me/wagnernew/9083\n\nThe convicts should all be out now. A part are dead, some are disabled, the slightly wounded and the unscathed ones have in any case finished their contracts. At the end of July the convicts still in the Wagner ranks reportedly received amnesty and were discharged, even if their 6 months of service were not over yet. The professionals are largely former members of the Russian AF in their 30s and 40s. During the peak of Wagner's fame recruitment was active and it attracted a significant number of volunteers, even those with no experience. Numerous support roles (from artillery to truck drivers) were in demand, and the minimum age to join Wagner as an not-convict was lowered to 22. For the Ukrainian military intelligence right now there are just 800/850 Wagner members in Belarus. Let's recall that in the last two months the new Wagner camp in Belarus [has been dismantled](https://nitter.net/Hajun_BY/status/1707036720502308920) by 2/3 of its size. A few hundreds are likely in Africa, continuing the PMC's actions over there. Presumably thousands signed contracts with the MoD (certainly not the 33'000 announced by government sources); thousands more have been discharged and are currently free of commitments and back to private life. Recall that for Russian mobilized or contract soldiers there's no such thing as vacation: they are allowed 1/2 week-long home visits every several months at the front (generally 6 afaik). Recently there was an outcry in Russian social media as a former professional Wagner member was accidentally killed during a fight in a pub. This suggests that a portion of the professional Wagner veterans are currently without commitments, although another and growing portion is signing contracts with the MoD.\n\nObviously a very high share of these 25'000+ dead happened in the battles for Bakhmut and Soledar. The monument could include Wagnerites who died in Africa and Syria in past years - several hundreds at least, but surely a small fraction of the total. I assume the convicts killed on the spot for desertion, indiscipline and the likes are excluded. Realistically I think several hundred cases, at least. The discipline enforced by Wagner was ironclad, certainly far more than is in force towards the MoD's Storm Z units (these are also used for defensive purposes, there have been instances where they have recorded protest videos - it would have been unthinkable for Wagner convicts).\n\nI think we have now relatively fairly accurate data on Russian losses and so we can have a discussion about the Bakhmut campaign.\n\nPMC Wagner's main action prior to the Bakhmut campaign was the capture of Popasna. This was not a stand-alone Wagner's action - the 102nd MRR of the 150 MRD, the 76th and elements of the 106th VDV Divisions, the 31st VDV Brigade as well as the 40th NIB were there as well - but the Wagnerite stormtroopers were essential in the strictly urban phase of the battle to overcome the fierce and tenacious Ukrainian resistance. I consider it likely that in these clashes Wagner may have had a handful of hundred KIAs. The second major action by the Wagner group was the capture of Svitlodarsk in late May (certainly less bloody than Popasna) and then of the nearby Vuhlehirska Power Station in late July. The seizure of the latter (along with the taking of Pokrovske in the same month) opened the door for the actions in what was to become Bakhmut's southern flank: in late August Wagner took Kodema and simultaneously succeeded in reaching the beginning of the (afterwards, well-known) Patrisa Lumumby Street on the eastern outskirts of Bakhmut itself.\n\nWhen we write about the battle of Bakhmut of course it's not just the city, but the whole area from Berestove to Ozarianivka (about 40 km long in a straight line) and logically including Soledar, which was a carnage and whose battle was very costly for both sides.\n\nWagner was not alone in Bakhmut. The unit that pulled off the first major action of the battle (the seizure of the Knauf plant in Soledar) was the 6th MRR of the LPR Army, during the first 10 days of August '22. In December there was evidence that elements of the 57th MRB (probably some tank companies) were in Bakhmut providing armored support to Wagner. The bulk of the 106th VDV Division was deployed to the area in late December and was essential in the advances of early January both in Soledar to the north and in Opytne to the south. Unconfirmed rumors also spoke of the presence, to provide support, of elements of the 98th VDV Division and of the 20th MRD. The outer flanks of the wider sector were covered by units of the 2nd Corps (LPR); in early May, with PMC Wagner heavily weakened and having announced its withdrawal and the beginning of Ukrainian attacks on the flanks, several regular brigades arrived and are still present in the sector today. That said, the overwhelming majority of the actions from August to May were the work of Wagner, that consequently took the overwhelming majority of casualties.\n\nBy mid-February an  [US estimate](https://kyivindependent.com/cnn-us-estimates-more-than-30-000-wagner-fighters-have-been-wounded-or-killed-in-ukraine/) put Wagner's death toll at 9'000, half of whom had been killed since mid-December (90% of whom were convicts). At the same time reports began to come out of convicts-only units that had like 98% casualty rates. With the new datas, taking them at face value, I find it legitimate at this point to assume that the Bakhmut campaign (+ the flanks of course) from August to May did cost the Russians around 25'000 KIAs/MIAs, Wagnerites for the vast majority. Yes, less than the figures announced by the Ukrainians, but more than Western estimates. The campaign thus seems to have been more costly to the Russians than it might have been expected. The survival rate of the convicts, on the other hand, seems to have been higher than one might have thought. Sure, far more than the 15% of convicts enlisted died - a percentage promised by Prigozhin during a visit to a penal colony. While Wagner's professionals on the contrary would have suffered much heavier losses than estimated.\n\nOn the Ukrainian side we don't have recent estimates, let alone official datas. If I were forced to produce an estimate, let's say that I would find it credible that in the battles for Bakhmut and Soledar the Ukrainians had between 10 and 15'000 KIAs/MIAs, maybe closer to the latter figure. I have no basis for stating this but I would find it consistent with estimates of Ukrainian losses relative to Russian ones being close to 1:2 (or very slightly worse) in Bakhmut, as I think Muzyka once estimated during a talk with Kofman IIRC (i.e. in line with what the consensus has estimated as being the average ratio of this conflict in general) - ignoring the out-of-reality estimates of 1:5 (at most achieved in some specific cases like Vuhledar during the winter and maybe in Avdiivka during certain months) or the delusional inverted ratios boasted by pro-Russians. For the UAF in all probability it was the bloodiest campaign of the war after the Russian Donbas offensive in April/June '22. Second out of three parts below.",

            "body": "There were no actual human waves by Wagner despite the elsewhere widespread beliefs; the convicts attacked in squads or small platoons to be used as decoys to unravel Ukrainian positions, which were then hit by Russian artillery and worked by Wagner's professional assault teams, also during the night thanks to the thermal visors that were fairly spread among them. Despite constant complaints from Prigozhin, it had been estimated in December that Wagner's organic artillery was firing about 2'000 shells per day, excluding the regular artillery units that were active on the outer flanks. As Defmon said, the battle might have had a different outcome if Ukraine had been able to employ the DPICMs since the end of last year.\n\nI am of the opinion that both Ukraine and Russia lost the battle for Bakhmut. First, let us recapitulate what were the objectives that the two sides were aiming for in Bakhmut, by briefly analyzing the history of the battle. \n\nEarly July '22. Russia had just taken the Lysychansk salient. A few weeks before it had finished conquering the Lyman sector, reaching Sviatohirsk. From Izyum the Russians were pushing towards south-east along the M03 Highway. The goal was to encircle the Sloviansk-Kramatorsk conurbation on three sides and close the Donbas issue: to the west of these cities there are basically just villages until Pavlohrad. Throughout the spring Ukraine had implemented a questionable urban defense strategy to \"hug\" the Russians: meaning, engaging them in house-to-house battles at relatively short distances where theoretically the overpowering Russian artillery fire would lose effectiveness, at a time when Ukraine was running out of its own stocks of 152/122mm but also 125mm ammos for tanks (Bulgarian/Romanian etc. factories had yet to get into full gear) and shipments of NATO calibers were just beginning. Certainly the Russians suffered really high losses during the spring campaign, but Ukraine wasted resources in the ill-advised defense of Rubizhne and then Severodonetsk on the other side of the Siversky Donets, with the UAF lacking reserves in both Popasna and in Svitlodarsk; the following month a disaster was barely avoided when the Russians broke through in Zolote/Hirske.\n\nIn early July the UA Army entrenched itself on the Siversk-Soledar-Bakhmut line, and given the strength the Russian AF had shown in the spring it was expected to be a temporary line to slow the Russian onslaught towards the inevitable battle of Sloviansk/Kramatorsk. Things went luckily differently, because by that time most of the Russian formations had all but exhausted their fighting potential. Siversk easily withstood the (relatively) timid Russian attacks during July. On the western bank of the Oskil River, in what was one of the best feats of the war, the formations of the Eastern Military District were stopped and beat their heads for months against a numerically far inferior Ukrainian grouping (consisting mainly of two very good brigades: the 93rd Mech and the 95th Air Assault) that managed to stop any ambition towards Sloviansk from the north-west. The Russians in Lyman were blocked by the Siversky Donets; everything changed with the Kharkiv counteroffensive: the Russians, besides Kupyansk, lost all the rest of the western bank of the Oskil, including Izyum and then Lyman. Russian dreams of surrounding Sloviansk on three sides vanished, and in fact the possibility of approaching it in the first place. Bakhmut also loses much of its importance. It was originally supposed to fall relatively fast like Popasna and act as a staging area for the fall/winter months for the pushes towards Sloviansk. Afaik Russian doctrine emphasizes cities as staging areas (Popasna was and still is the key to supplies for the front around Bakhmut), which is a good reason why having avoided the retreat from Bakhmut during the fall was, in my opinion, very positive. \n\nSumming up, the battle intensifies month after month in the fall; in December most of the brigades that had been holding out in Bakhmut since September/October are withdrawn to regain fighting ability and are largely replaced by brigades that partook in the Kherson campaign, while other brigades that had been in the area since September remained in the fight; at the same time numerous TDF elements arrived as reinforcements. In January the Russians broke through in Soledar, then took Klishchiivka to the south and began a rapid advance on the flanks that would slow only by mid-March. It was clear that as long as Soledar held out, Bakhmut could be safe. The Soledar mess unfortunately veered the momentum in favor of the Russians; I hold the opinion that the Ukrainian choice to defend the city made sense until the first half of February, when the Russians reached M03 Highway and then took, in the second half of the month, the fields south of Berkhivka and Yahidne, which effectively ended up making Ukrainian supplies to Bakhmut very difficult. The situation for Ukraine worsened as the only route to Bakhmut remained the notorious dirt road from Chasiv Yar to Khromove, which complicated CASEVAC, as well as causing a chronic shortage of mortar shells to the units entrenched in the city. Instead for some reason (read: politics) it was decided to remain in Bakhmut despite all the difficulties.\n\nThe justification of both the sides was that the fighting bought time. For the Russians, I remember Prigozhin stating in an interview several months ago that he was tasked by Surovikin to start the \"Bakhmut meatgrinder\" with the task of buying time for the reconstitution of the regular forces, exhausted by 7 months of war, and trying to bleed the UAF dry. By September Russia was in a mess: much of the regular formations' fighting capacities had been lost, D/LPR units had suffered huge losses and there were fewer and fewer locals to draft there, entire frontlines were held by Rosgvardia without heavy equipment. Mobilization and the slow awakening of the MIC were then initiated. With the overwhelming majority of the VDV stuck in Kherson, the Eastern front found itself very weak; as early as mid-October, after the Battle of Lyman had bought some time for the Russians, the first mobilized were thrown to the Svatove-Kreminna line, which was to be reinforced the following month by the VDV withdrawn from Kherson, while much of the formations of the Western and Central MDs spent the winter being reconstituted in Belarus. An operation was therefore needed to be set up in a short time to keep as many Ukrainian brigades as possible busy. Prigozhin was thus authorized to recruit in the prisons as PMC Wagner, which had shown tactical competence in the previous months, was the chosen one for the Bakhmut operation.\n\nAt the same time, the Ukrainian command, among the various justifications for resistance in Bakhmut since March, used that of \"buying time\" while the \"NATO-trained\" brigades were being prepared for the counteroffensive. The Ukrainians took heavy losses, in a terrain that had become severely hostile in the last months (let's recall anyway that for each side the majority of losses presumably occurred on the flanks). The \"Kherson dividend\" (in terms of the availability of a Corps-sized grouping after the liberation of the right-bank) was spent in Bakhmut (except for the marine brigades that went to Avdiivka); the then-new brigades (46th and 77th Airmobile), largely trained in the UK for offensive purposes, suffered very high losses to the extent that their operational effectiveness was completely compromised (the 46th and 128th were withdrawn from the front after Soledar and took months to be reconstituted, as did the 24th, 58th and the 71st). The 93rd was withdrawn in December from Soledar and returned after a month and a half of recovery in late January to the center of Bakhmut where it remained until the retreat; the bulk of the brigade is still being reconstituted. The TD brigades suffered really high losses, which were made worse by the fact that they included poorly-trained men who were also used for local counterattacks. \n\nThe Russians took extreme losses - in all likelihood more than they expected. In the long run they are no less defeated: Wagner Group is all but spent and presumably no longer existing as a stand-alone force; their realistic chances of exploiting the new operational depths gained with the capture of Bakhmut are pretty much zero, since they are now the ones on the defensive in the sector. Now the \"Bakhmut curse\" falls to the Russians: it's their turn to suffer heavy losses and have to concentrate formations in Bakhmut (that would be more useful elsewhere) just for political reasons. The Ukrainians are attacking in Bakhmut without diverting reserves from other sectors and with limited resources, and nevertheless are managing to keep a large Russian grouping (estimated being made up of 52'000 troops) pinned down in Bakhmut, including numerous VDV units that would otherwise have been sent to the South. Particularly in the southern flank the Russians are engaged in bloody positional battles and despite being on the defensive, taking into account the numerous counterattacks, the attrition is probably worse than that experienced by the Ukrainians. Last (short) part below.",
            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>There were no actual human waves by Wagner despite the elsewhere widespread beliefs; the convicts attacked in squads or small platoons to be used as decoys to unravel Ukrainian positions, which were then hit by Russian artillery and worked by Wagner&#39;s professional assault teams, also during the night thanks to the thermal visors that were fairly spread among them. Despite constant complaints from Prigozhin, it had been estimated in December that Wagner&#39;s organic artillery was firing about 2&#39;000 shells per day, excluding the regular artillery units that were active on the outer flanks. As Defmon said, the battle might have had a different outcome if Ukraine had been able to employ the DPICMs since the end of last year.</p>\n\n<p>I am of the opinion that both Ukraine and Russia lost the battle for Bakhmut. First, let us recapitulate what were the objectives that the two sides were aiming for in Bakhmut, by briefly analyzing the history of the battle. </p>\n\n<p>Early July &#39;22. Russia had just taken the Lysychansk salient. A few weeks before it had finished conquering the Lyman sector, reaching Sviatohirsk. From Izyum the Russians were pushing towards south-east along the M03 Highway. The goal was to encircle the Sloviansk-Kramatorsk conurbation on three sides and close the Donbas issue: to the west of these cities there are basically just villages until Pavlohrad. Throughout the spring Ukraine had implemented a questionable urban defense strategy to &quot;hug&quot; the Russians: meaning, engaging them in house-to-house battles at relatively short distances where theoretically the overpowering Russian artillery fire would lose effectiveness, at a time when Ukraine was running out of its own stocks of 152/122mm but also 125mm ammos for tanks (Bulgarian/Romanian etc. factories had yet to get into full gear) and shipments of NATO calibers were just beginning. Certainly the Russians suffered really high losses during the spring campaign, but Ukraine wasted resources in the ill-advised defense of Rubizhne and then Severodonetsk on the other side of the Siversky Donets, with the UAF lacking reserves in both Popasna and in Svitlodarsk; the following month a disaster was barely avoided when the Russians broke through in Zolote/Hirske.</p>\n\n<p>In early July the UA Army entrenched itself on the Siversk-Soledar-Bakhmut line, and given the strength the Russian AF had shown in the spring it was expected to be a temporary line to slow the Russian onslaught towards the inevitable battle of Sloviansk/Kramatorsk. Things went luckily differently, because by that time most of the Russian formations had all but exhausted their fighting potential. Siversk easily withstood the (relatively) timid Russian attacks during July. On the western bank of the Oskil River, in what was one of the best feats of the war, the formations of the Eastern Military District were stopped and beat their heads for months against a numerically far inferior Ukrainian grouping (consisting mainly of two very good brigades: the 93rd Mech and the 95th Air Assault) that managed to stop any ambition towards Sloviansk from the north-west. The Russians in Lyman were blocked by the Siversky Donets; everything changed with the Kharkiv counteroffensive: the Russians, besides Kupyansk, lost all the rest of the western bank of the Oskil, including Izyum and then Lyman. Russian dreams of surrounding Sloviansk on three sides vanished, and in fact the possibility of approaching it in the first place. Bakhmut also loses much of its importance. It was originally supposed to fall relatively fast like Popasna and act as a staging area for the fall/winter months for the pushes towards Sloviansk. Afaik Russian doctrine emphasizes cities as staging areas (Popasna was and still is the key to supplies for the front around Bakhmut), which is a good reason why having avoided the retreat from Bakhmut during the fall was, in my opinion, very positive. </p>\n\n<p>Summing up, the battle intensifies month after month in the fall; in December most of the brigades that had been holding out in Bakhmut since September/October are withdrawn to regain fighting ability and are largely replaced by brigades that partook in the Kherson campaign, while other brigades that had been in the area since September remained in the fight; at the same time numerous TDF elements arrived as reinforcements. In January the Russians broke through in Soledar, then took Klishchiivka to the south and began a rapid advance on the flanks that would slow only by mid-March. It was clear that as long as Soledar held out, Bakhmut could be safe. The Soledar mess unfortunately veered the momentum in favor of the Russians; I hold the opinion that the Ukrainian choice to defend the city made sense until the first half of February, when the Russians reached M03 Highway and then took, in the second half of the month, the fields south of Berkhivka and Yahidne, which effectively ended up making Ukrainian supplies to Bakhmut very difficult. The situation for Ukraine worsened as the only route to Bakhmut remained the notorious dirt road from Chasiv Yar to Khromove, which complicated CASEVAC, as well as causing a chronic shortage of mortar shells to the units entrenched in the city. Instead for some reason (read: politics) it was decided to remain in Bakhmut despite all the difficulties.</p>\n\n<p>The justification of both the sides was that the fighting bought time. For the Russians, I remember Prigozhin stating in an interview several months ago that he was tasked by Surovikin to start the &quot;Bakhmut meatgrinder&quot; with the task of buying time for the reconstitution of the regular forces, exhausted by 7 months of war, and trying to bleed the UAF dry. By September Russia was in a mess: much of the regular formations&#39; fighting capacities had been lost, D/LPR units had suffered huge losses and there were fewer and fewer locals to draft there, entire frontlines were held by Rosgvardia without heavy equipment. Mobilization and the slow awakening of the MIC were then initiated. With the overwhelming majority of the VDV stuck in Kherson, the Eastern front found itself very weak; as early as mid-October, after the Battle of Lyman had bought some time for the Russians, the first mobilized were thrown to the Svatove-Kreminna line, which was to be reinforced the following month by the VDV withdrawn from Kherson, while much of the formations of the Western and Central MDs spent the winter being reconstituted in Belarus. An operation was therefore needed to be set up in a short time to keep as many Ukrainian brigades as possible busy. Prigozhin was thus authorized to recruit in the prisons as PMC Wagner, which had shown tactical competence in the previous months, was the chosen one for the Bakhmut operation.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, the Ukrainian command, among the various justifications for resistance in Bakhmut since March, used that of &quot;buying time&quot; while the &quot;NATO-trained&quot; brigades were being prepared for the counteroffensive. The Ukrainians took heavy losses, in a terrain that had become severely hostile in the last months (let&#39;s recall anyway that for each side the majority of losses presumably occurred on the flanks). The &quot;Kherson dividend&quot; (in terms of the availability of a Corps-sized grouping after the liberation of the right-bank) was spent in Bakhmut (except for the marine brigades that went to Avdiivka); the then-new brigades (46th and 77th Airmobile), largely trained in the UK for offensive purposes, suffered very high losses to the extent that their operational effectiveness was completely compromised (the 46th and 128th were withdrawn from the front after Soledar and took months to be reconstituted, as did the 24th, 58th and the 71st).

Russia, according to Izvestia, will create new \"special\" brigades, focused on assault on fortified positions and deep reconnaissance behind enemy lines.

Another source of inspiration could be the reconnaissance brigades, a very special and rare type of formation in the Russian Army (there are just two such brigades), but unlike these they will have an armored component.

The VDV will increasingly become elite mechanized infantry.\n\nIn any case, the expansion of the VDV and the creation of this new type of brigade may be the consequence of the demise of Wagner, as well as of the will to try to limit the human casualties caused by attacks in the cannon fodder style (like in Bakhmut and in Avdiivka) and to try to make tactical gains by employing limited numbers of assault infantry, like Ukraine has been doing lately. Therefore, I don't rule out that former Wagner members (who, largely, have past experience in the Spetsnaz, VDV or Naval Infantry) who will sign contracts with the MoD will be redirected to these units.

                "body": "Hi and thank you! Sorry for the delay - yesterday I didn't have time for a proper answer to your very interesting questions.\n\nTo answer the first question I will try to give a recap of the Popasna affair. The fall of the town was caused by the enormous superiority of fire, equipment and personnel on the part of the Russians and was also strongly due to the lack of reserves on the part of the Ukrainians. \n\nIt was a very important stronghold on the 2015 line; from the first days of the war it was hit by Grads and artillery. If we listen to the testimony of Ukrainian veterans, the Russians were constantly attacking in every way: only infantry, only tanks, tanks and infantry. First (early April) they took the fields south of the town - it was not easy, the whole area was filled with Ukrainian trenches and fortifications. Once taken, they attacked the town from at least two sides. The power of the Russian artillery was devastating. IIRC the Russians had five (tube) artillery and three rocket artillery brigades in the area. Tanks were used extensively in the battle for direct fire against Ukrainian positions. The Russians fired at the buildings to bring them down and destroy the Ukrainian positions. Once the town was virtually leveled, Wagner went into action, using the tactic of isolating Ukrainian urban strongholds to annihilate them or force the soldiers to surrender. \n\nThe 24th Mechanized Brigade fought extremely tenaciously, almost always never abandoning its positions if not forced. But it suffered devastating losses. The problem was that the Ukrainian Army for real had no reserves and was always moving on the edge. Very capable brigades like the 80th Air Assault were divided between several zones to fix problems created by less competent units. For instance it was crucial to delay the closing of the Zolote/Hirske pocket when the LPR Army drove TDF units out of Toshkivka, posing great risks to the Ukrainians just to the south.\n\nI had heard some time ago that in June 2022, a promising counterattack by the 93rd Brigade in the Izyum sector was cancelled because there wasn't any fresh battalion left to continue the action. That's it. Now, certainly at that time the Ukrainian Army was definitely smaller than it is now, and given the intensity of the Russian offensive and the length of the front, it's understandable they had not spare formations at their will. But the problem is that the choices of the Ukrainian General Staff aggravated the situation. The most famous and rightly criticized event was the all-out defense of Rubizhne and Severodonetsk, with a significant number of Ukrainian brigades on the \"wrong\" side of the Siversky Donets. \n\nLess well known are the events in the Lyman sector, i.e. the eastern bank of the Oskil. While one could understand the ambition to defend the area because of its proximity to Slovyansk, in hindsight it turned out to be a poor choice. It kept several good Ukrainian brigades busy - such as the 81st Airmobile in Sviatohirsk and the 79th Air Assault in Lyman/Yampil. They fought well, but at a cost. The latter in particular took very ugly losses and needed months to recover operational capabilities. Considering how difficult a mechanized river crossing is (just ask the HQ of the Russian 74th MRB for infos), it would have been smarter to abandon the northern side of the Siversky Donets altogether and build defensive positions on the southern bank, while simultaneously reinforcing the grouping in the Izyum sector. When resources are scarce one must concentrate them in the most efficient ways and make choices, even painful ones. Let's not mention how the Ukrainians at that time were also conducting offensives in Kherson with the aim of diverting Russian resources from the East. With few exceptions (the seizure of the bridgehead at Lozove) the attacks didn't go that well, also due to the use of newly mobilized reserve brigades. It wasn't until August that the Russians, understanding that the famous counteroffensive was coming, sent reinforcements to Kherson and Zaporizhzhia - the entire Eastern MD was deployed to the Southern front, which was the key reason why the Kharkiv counteroffensive was so successful - but by then the Russian onslaught had already been exhausted and the Lysychansk salient lost. \n\nAnother case was Svitlodarsk, defended by the 30th Mechanized Brigade (it also included the 47th Assault Battalion, which would later become the 47th Brigade!). The sector held well until the brigade had to send a battalion to face the breakthrough north of Popasna and another to reinforce the southern bank of the Siversky Donets near Bilohorivka where the failed Russian crossing had occurred. At that point Wagner took Svitlodarsk with relatively little difficulty.\n\nOnce Popasna was taken, the survivors from the 24th Brigade retreated to the trenches in the north-east, around Zolote; the Russians had gained a topographically very good position (Popasna sits in the hills). To the north and the west of the town the Ukrainian fortifications were much less developed compared to the east (where the 2015 line passed). The Russians at that point maneuvered northward, gaining positions, until they found the Ukrainian trenches around Zolote, which held out until around June 20. The problem is that the northwestward advance was instead very rapid and objectively a test of tactical competence. I remember reading that a tactic often successfully used by the Russians in the advances northwest of Popasna was to \"feint\" a mechanized/armored push toward a village, wait for the Ukrainians to rush there in order to block them in defense and then send the VDV to occupy nearby villages, even by crossing streams, etc., with very fast-paced operations - which often caused the Ukrainian artillery to find itself displaced and unable to keep the pace of the VDV advances (that would later flank the initial village). With these tactics villages like Trypillya or Vasylivka fell, IIRC. Yes, the Russians did such things, but then others (mostly separatist units) had compensate for the over-intelligence shown by others with their typical frontal attacks. It must be said that D/LPR units were variable in quality: you had the 2014/15 veteran units that knew the terrain well, were made up of motivated volunteers and had decent mechanization capabilities. Then you had the units pulled up with the general mobilization of the two republics that were often quite terrible and used for reconnaissance in force.  \n\nThe 76th VDV Division aided by elements of the 90th Tank Division also managed to cut the T1302 (Bakhmut-Lysychansk highway) around Berestove; several successful Ukrainian counterattacks (thanks again, 80th AAB) succeeded in blocking the Russians, who, however, had the road under fire control at that point anyway. When the Russians then succeeded in occupying the hills around Vrubivka, it was no accident that Zolote and Hirske fell the following week.\n\nAt the time of the Donbass offensive the basic unit of the Russian Army was still the BTG, which today practically is no longer used. Usually, to my knowledge, the attacks were organized by a BTG, with one element deputed to attack and others to act as a reserve or to flank the enemy. Hence, also to answer the last question, I would say the answer is yes. I don't know much about this, though, so take it with a pinch of salt. To answer the third question, by April the Russians partially understood their February/March mistakes, when the lack of dismounts was often fatal to them. On some occasions the Russian units were reinforced by D/LPR infantry, on other occasions (as in the case of the \"veteran\" separatist units), the latters had their own areas of responsibility and acted more autonomously. To return to the second question, one only has to look at the equipment losses of the time to see immediately that the attacks were heavily armored and mechanized (including for the VDV). Today Russian material losses are significantly lower than at that time (especially the losses to ATGM) - if the Russians had continued to lose gear at those rates they would be in a very ugly position now.",

Maybe the Russians would have broken through anyway, but if the brigades deployed north of the S-D River had been employed around Popasna and in Svitlodarsk the outcome might have been different. I think the MilitaryLand map, while very good, underestimates the Ukrainian grouping in Severodonetsk: the 57th Motorized was definitely there, as was the 115th Mechanized (which fucked up) and elements of the 128th Mountain Assault, for instance...\n\nThe sources are many: there are several Ukrainian analysts/observers, also Tom Cooper does interesting analysis even if he sometimes has way overly optimistic pro-Ukrainian tones. There are YouTube interviews with Ukrainian veterans; DeepState as well is a very good source, both for analysis but especially for [its map](https://deepstatemap.live) - DeepState team has direct contacts with HQs of Ukrainian brigades, they are able to know about territorial changes before geolocations can confirm them and despite being Ukrainian it hardly sugarcoats stuff. The map starts in the first half of April 2022 and has been updated almost every day since then, it's an invaluable tool, I recommend you use it - I always use it to check the progress of a given advance in the past. Other pages like GeoConfirmed on Twitter are great because they keep track of the geolocations associated with a given Ukrainian unit, and so it allows to see where elements of a given formation were, even in the earliest months of the war. I've been delving a little deeper into the Kyiv campaign lately, generally the first month of the war is the most difficult to analyze as many of the existing tools (maps, geolocations, etc.) and today's analysts weren't available at the beginning.

Maybe the Russians would have broken through anyway, but if the brigades deployed north of the S-D River had been employed around Popasna and in Svitlodarsk the outcome might have been different. I think the MilitaryLand map, while very good, underestimates the Ukrainian grouping in Severodonetsk: the 57th Motorized was definitely there, as was the 115th Mechanized (which fucked up) and elements of the 128th Mountain Assault, for instance...</p>\n\n<p>The sources are many: there are several Ukrainian analysts/observers, also Tom Cooper does interesting analysis even if he sometimes has way overly optimistic pro-Ukrainian tones. There are YouTube interviews with Ukrainian veterans; DeepState as well is a very good source, both for analysis but especially for <a href=\"https://deepstatemap.live\">its map</a> - DeepState team has direct contacts with HQs of Ukrainian brigades, they are able to know about territorial changes before geolocations can confirm them and despite being Ukrainian it hardly sugarcoats stuff. The map starts in the first half of April 2022 and has been updated almost every day since then, it&#39;s an invaluable tool, I recommend you use it - I always use it to check the progress of a given advance in the past. Other pages like GeoConfirmed on Twitter are great because they keep track of the geolocations associated with a given Ukrainian unit, and so it allows to see where elements of a given formation were, even in the earliest months of the war. I&#39;ve been delving a little deeper into the Kyiv campaign lately, generally the first month of the war is the most difficult to analyze as many of the existing tools (maps, geolocations, etc.) and today&#39;s analysts weren&#39;t available at the beginning.

                "body": "I'm fairly certain that the overwhelming majority of their capacity in this area is being devoted to repairing or cannibalizing damaged tanks recovered from the battlefield rather than toward reestablishing new production to replace that lost capacity you mention, and for good reason.\n\nOryx lists 684 Russians tanks abandoned or captured and an additional 54 Ukrainian tanks damaged. So at a minimum they probably have needed to repair or rehabilitate around 700 tanks in the last 18 months. But that doesn't say much about the total number of Ukrainian tanks recovered in a damaged state, because recoverable damaged vehicles are by definition the least likely to be documented by Oryx because they spend less time abandoned on the battlefield where they might be photographed.\n\nBut I think it's safe to estimate that the number is no more than roughly on par with total documented losses, otherwise there would be noticeably fewer Ukrainian tanks available to fight, maybe even practically zero. Meaning, Ukraine has not recovered many times more damaged vehicles than it has lost altogether. At least not vehicles damaged to such an extent that they can't be repaired in the field or at a brigade-level depot and need to be repaired at what is effectively a full tank factory in the strategic rear. I'm sure they've recovered hundreds or possibly thousands of vehicles (counting repeat customers) that just needed a quick replacement part, but those aren't relevant in terms of absorbing far rear area mechanical talent.\n\nIt is also unlikely that they are recovering insubstantial numbers of these vehicles, as we can infer from the large number of heavy recovery vehicles delivered as part of aid packages and the reported high rates of recoverable western equipment knocked out of combat during the summer counteroffensive. Prioritizing recovery and repair aligns well with Ukraine's demonstrated preference for force preservation and generally thrifty exploitation of resources.\n\nSo maybe we could estimate it at around 1000 tanks per year that need some TLC from the mechanics and specialists who might otherwise be engaged in building new tanks from scratch. If reallocated to new production, the same workers would likely produce far fewer tanks than they are able to repair or reconstitute from damaged vehicles. Probably only a couple hundred or so per year under optimistic constraints. So it makes sense not to bother building new tanks when the repair backlog is likely enough to keep the same individuals busy for a long time into the future.\n\nEspecially given the ability to source superior equipment from the west. The Ukrainian MIC is starting to develop partnerships to bring some heavy equipment production like IFVs back into Ukraine, though. Notably the experience of Ukrainian mechanics and specialists with Soviet-derived equipment likely does not translate particularly well to new production of western equipment. I would venture to guess that the deal with Sweden to build licensed CV-90 variants, for example, is part of an effort to rebuild the production capacity the Ukrainians lost early in the war but in more long term viable western or Korean designs rather than trying to build T- variants again.",
                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m fairly certain that the overwhelming majority of their capacity in this area is being devoted to repairing or cannibalizing damaged tanks recovered from the battlefield rather than toward reestablishing new production to replace that lost capacity you mention, and for good reason.</p>\n\n<p>Oryx lists 684 Russians tanks abandoned or captured and an additional 54 Ukrainian tanks damaged. So at a minimum they probably have needed to repair or rehabilitate around 700 tanks in the last 18 months. But that doesn&#39;t say much about the total number of Ukrainian tanks recovered in a damaged state, because recoverable damaged vehicles are by definition the least likely to be documented by Oryx because they spend less time abandoned on the battlefield where they might be photographed.</p>\n\n<p>But I think it&#39;s safe to estimate that the number is no more than roughly on par with total documented losses, otherwise there would be noticeably fewer Ukrainian tanks available to fight, maybe even practically zero. Meaning, Ukraine has not recovered many times more damaged vehicles than it has lost altogether. At least not vehicles damaged to such an extent that they can&#39;t be repaired in the field or at a brigade-level depot and need to be repaired at what is effectively a full tank factory in the strategic rear. I&#39;m sure they&#39;ve recovered hundreds or possibly thousands of vehicles (counting repeat customers) that just needed a quick replacement part, but those aren&#39;t relevant in terms of absorbing far rear area mechanical talent.</p>\n\n<p>It is also unlikely that they are recovering insubstantial numbers of these vehicles, as we can infer from the large number of heavy recovery vehicles delivered as part of aid packages and the reported high rates of recoverable western equipment knocked out of combat during the summer counteroffensive. Prioritizing recovery and repair aligns well with Ukraine&#39;s demonstrated preference for force preservation and generally thrifty exploitation of resources.</p>\n\n<p>So maybe we could estimate it at around 1000 tanks per year that need some TLC from the mechanics and specialists who might otherwise be engaged in building new tanks from scratch. If reallocated to new production, the same workers would likely produce far fewer tanks than they are able to repair or reconstitute from damaged vehicles. Probably only a couple hundred or so per year under optimistic constraints. So it makes sense not to bother building new tanks when the repair backlog is likely enough to keep the same individuals busy for a long time into the future.</p>\n\n<p>Especially given the ability to source superior equipment from the west. The Ukrainian MIC is starting to develop partnerships to bring some heavy equipment production like IFVs back into Ukraine, though. Notably the experience of Ukrainian mechanics and specialists with Soviet-derived equipment likely does not translate particularly well to new production of western equipment. I would venture to guess that the deal with Sweden to build licensed CV-90 variants, for example, is part of an effort to rebuild the production capacity the Ukrainians lost early in the war but in more long term viable western or Korean designs rather than trying to build T- variants again.</p>\n</div>",

The Department will account for WMD threats holistically to prevent, mitigate, withstand, operate through, and recover from WMD attacks in close consultation with Allies and partners.\n\n\"This Strategy lays the foundation for the Department to confront the complex and demanding challenges presented by WMD,\" wrote Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin in the Secretary's Foreword. \u00a0\n\nIn line with the 2022 National Defense Strategy, the CWMD Strategy recognizes the People's Republic of China as the pacing challenge, Russia as the acute threat, and the DPRK, Iran, and violent extremist organizations as persistent threats.\n\nRecognizing that different actors and threat modalities pose distinct challenges, the CWMD Strategy outlines a strategic approach that requires tailored investments and actions to address each challenge. The CWMD Strategy explains how the Department will align authorities, operations, activities, and investments based on the DoD's unique current and emerging CWMD needs.\n\n\"This Strategy reinforces other guidance provided in the Nuclear Posture Review, the Missile Defense Review, and the Biodefense Posture Review by clarifying the role of the CWMD mission within the Department's overall approach to integrated deterrence and conflict,\" said Secretary Lloyd Austin, \"I am confident that the Department possesses the ingenuity and determination necessary to outpace current and future threats.\"\n\nThe 2023 CWMD Strategy is the third iteration for the Department, and replaces the 2014 Strategy for CWMD.\u00a0",

Our shitty ports who have been fighting automation and other tech improvements since the 1950s mean there's higher marginal costs to export.

Unfortunately, I agree with you that it works out quite poorly in practice. On programs I have worked, every couple of years there's just a brief period where the new guy has to be educated about how software engineering works from scratch, during which large scale initiatives tend to fizzle out because of lack of support from above. We spend so much time getting them up to speed on basic concepts like unit tests that we never even get to the more challenging questions, like how to design and document interfaces that allow for interoperability across the force structure, or the importance of a holistic testing pyramid applied across the entire software development lifecycle. Having to justify expending labor hours on unit tests to someone who has never written a line of code is a frustrating experience, and one which continues to waste enormous amounts of expensive engineering management time across the entirety of the US armed forces while also ensuring we implement fewer tests than engineers would prefer to because we are required to justify the expenditures to people who see the dollars spent but do not comprehend the impact on the quality of the output.\n\nPlus, these short-timers rarely learn enough to be helpful and are mostly at the mercy of those under their command, especially the civilian and contract program managers, who often are motivated by financial incentives that do not necessarily align with the program objectives (especially if the program needs change faster than the contracts, which is almost always the case) and frequently also lack software engineering experience, because they are retired military who jumped directly into program management. There's a reason they do not have non-medical officers making medical decisions for a medical command, yet they have non-engineering officers making critical decisions for engineering programs. Imagine if a doctor was recommending a serious treatment for a patient and the answer was \"we don't think you know what you're talking about, give them ibuprofen and it'll be fine.\" That's what it is like developing software for the DoD a lot of the time. (As an aside, I don't mean to be all doom and gloom, there are isolated pockets of excellence that emerge when a sufficiently savvy program manager gets connected with an actually qualified and motivated engineering team, but that is by far the exception rather than the rule).\n\nThe DoD hasn't come to recognize yet that software engineering needs to be a core warfighting function and cannot simply be left to civilian contractors. We need uniformed engineers who are ready and able to adapt software in the field to meet the unique circumstances that arise in combat. Imagine if every single US drone were being shot down shortly after launch during a war because an enemy figured out how to exploit a minor bug that makes the drone take a predictable path when evading SAMs. A six month change order process or even a three week sprint process just won't be responsive enough to handle a problem like that in a timely enough manner to meet combat requirements. Yet the skills and knowledge required to use the drones effectively overlaps significantly with the skills and knowledge required to program them, so it makes sense to train uniformed operators with precisely those skills and that knowledge as part of their core competencies. That would also have the side benefit of making many military jobs better training for highly paid private sector jobs in tech, and thus improving recruitment while also making the US labor market more competitive. \n\nUltimately, the rotation policy and the unwillingness to treat software as a core warfighting function shows insufficient respect for the specialty. We have people with zero experience in engineering dictating low level details like how contractors time their sprints (which also shows a remarkable inability to understand Agile development, which is precisely about delegating those decisions to the team itself). I don't think military doctors have to put up with the same level of interference, at least not when it comes to the details of medicine like selecting specific treatment options for specific patients. Unlike engineering, there are ranking officers who come from the medical specialty, so they get some cover from above even when there is interference, and they benefit from a clearly delineated and well understood area of responsibility and educational qualifications that receive a lot of deference when compared to software devs. On the other hand, I doubt there is a single O-6+ officer in the entire US military that can write a single line of code. And I think I personally know a substantial percentage of the O-5s and below who can because there simply are so few (and most are in the reserves because why would you stay active duty when you can make way more money dealing with less bullshit in the private sector).\n\nBut unlike medicine, software pervades everything the military does and cannot easily be isolated into a specialized stovepipe. Almost every single weapon and process in the military depends on code in some way. Even dumb weapons and their ammo depend on automated manufacturing processes and computerized designs. Mechanical and aerospace engineering depend heavily on various software tools for computer-aided designs and simulations, never mind any GNC components for guided systems. ISR depends heavily on automatic collection and processing of a broad array of data sources. All of C2 is effectively pure software at this point (with a large dash of electrical engineering that is also effectively a software development process at this point).\n\nYet software engineering is still treated as a sideshow, when really it is the battleground of the future. Future wars won't be fought by humans on the battlefield, they'll be fought first by the programmers and engineers who build the drones, then by the operators who program the drones prior to and during combat. Combat victories will start to depend not just on who has the best kit at the outset of a conflict, but also on who can update the programming for their drones most quickly and effectively, as in the drone SAM example I gave above. Thus, eventually operators will need to program on some level. Even if we are talking about a low- or no- code solution, configuring drones for combat will require someone to program the drones with specific instructions in a manner that is effectively equivalent to writing code, the quality of which will in large part determine the outcome of the battle. \n\nSo from that perspective, it makes some sense for general officers to gain exposure to software engineering during regular rotations. However, a two year stint late in their career does not cut it. It puts them in a position to detract from the quality of the development processes whilst still failing to learn enough to make them better commanders of a highly computerized force structure. Instead, we need commanders who spend large parts of their career deep in the weeds of software development, so they can more easily understand the power and limitations of software while also gaining exposure to the kinds of organizations and processes that produce quality software.",

Future wars won&#39;t be fought by humans on the battlefield, they&#39;ll be fought first by the programmers and engineers who build the drones, then by the operators who program the drones prior to and during combat. Combat victories will start to depend not just on who has the best kit at the outset of a conflict, but also on who can update the programming for their drones most quickly and effectively, as in the drone SAM example I gave above. Thus, eventually operators will need to program on some level. Even if we are talking about a low- or no- code solution, configuring drones for combat will require someone to program the drones with specific instructions in a manner that is effectively equivalent to writing code, the quality of which will in large part determine the outcome of the battle. </p>\n\n<p>So from that perspective, it makes some sense for general officers to gain exposure to software engineering during regular rotations. However, a two year stint late in their career does not cut it. It puts them in a position to detract from the quality of the development processes whilst still failing to learn enough to make them better commanders of a highly computerized force structure. Instead, we need commanders who spend large parts of their career deep in the weeds of software development, so they can more easily understand the power and limitations of software while also gaining exposure to the kinds of organizations and processes that produce quality software.</p>\n</div>",

I've seen it across multiple distinct industries during my career, including policy work at federal agencies, practicing law, public accounting, defense, and general business operations. The entire reason I am a software engineer now is because I couldn't get support to automate easily automated tasks while working as a lawyer, and so automated everything myself instead. After a couple of jobs where I did that, I decided software was the better career path both for me in particular and in general, and made the permanent switch.\n\nIf everyone working white collar jobs were like me, there wouldn't be any pure software engineers because people in non-software positions would be constantly automating as much as possible, until eventually they automate themselves out of a job altogether. Of course most people lack the ability or motivation to do so. Even if they don't, many aren't as self-destructively willing to eliminate the source of their own employment as I am. Yet for many jobs, it's only a matter of time until traditional software or more novel AI replaces them. My theory was that I might as well get out ahead of it, and be the guy maintaining the software rather than the one laid off because of it.\n\nDefense is rife with such tasks. [As I described in a recent comment/rant on this same topic here, the culture of the DoD treats the time and motivation of individual members of the armed forces as an entirely free and limitless resource which can be squandered at will with no consequences.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/comments/163k83i/credibledefense_daily_megathread_august_28_2023/jy44mb5/) The culture is to pay lip service to \"helping out the warfighters downrange\" while simultaneously ignoring their needs to pursue whatever political or corporate objective best serves the careers of the individuals involved.\n\nI was lucky when I worked in defense tech because I was at a small, newly founded company that operated like a modern tech firm rather than a stodgy old big defense contractor. And I had a great team doing some really remarkably interesting and impactful work. Dealing with end users was also a pleasure, because they were often highly experienced veterans with expertise in the subject matter. But in between my team and those end users were many layers of incompetent go-betweens, who inserted themselves into whatever processes they could to justify their salary. A few of these were government employees, but that was actually quite rare. Most of the federal employees I dealt with were committed to their work and cared deeply about the end result.\n\nThe bulk of the shiftless deadweight came from the big contractors, who make endless promises about how their expertise in program management will add magical fairy dust to a software development program for a better final result, without ever explaining how taking budget away from the extremely limited quantity of SWEs available would enhance anything at all (Leidos IME is the worst at this, that entire company can burn in the shitter as far as I am concerned). These are the sorts of people who promote SAFe Agile and other bullshit cargo culting practices as the silver bullet to DoD's software problems. SAFe and similarly bastardized versions of Agile appeal to the DoD because they do not want to take any risk on at all and instead prefer waterfall. SAFe just repackages waterfall into something labeled Agile that in no way resembles actual Agile development. The DoD supporters of these processes don't realize that requirements risk is irreducible. There is no way to avoid misspecifying requirements in advance so any software dev process must adapt to changing requirements quickly, without any onerous change orders or bureaucracy. Otherwise, you will simply end up with a shitty piece of software that probably does not do what it is supposed to do, or if it does, it does so poorly and in a manner carefully designed to meet the minimum requirements precisely as worded, regardless of the impact on end users.\n\nIME, the best way to develop software is to get the engineers talking directly to users as much as possible while still giving the them solid chunks of deep focus time. Otherwise an expensive game of telephone ensues, where some set of intermediaries collect requirements, evaluate the software for meeting those requirements, and communicate defects to the engineers. Even the language of defects represents a counterproductive culture more concerned with placing blame than with improving outcomes. Practically by definition, these analysts are less able to translate the feedback from users into actual software, and generally just introduce noise into the process because they are not able to effectively understand either the users or the engineers as well as the two groups understand themselves. DoD has in general taken the telephone approach, throwing tons of labor into job categories that are effectively business analysts or process managers like scrum masters who actively erect obstacles between engineers and users. I believe this is primarily driven by the labor costs. DoD and government generally are limited in terms of what they can pay per hour for labor. Ironically, even though budget may be available on a project, it can't be spent on more engineering talent because at some point the DoD exhausts the relatively small part of the market willing to work for what are pretty awful wages. So instead they redirect those funds toward process management. Real SWE talent is expensive, and typically demands well above the rates that the government can pay. Either only extremely low quality or especially motivated engineers will work for the DoD as a result.\n\nI had to take a massive pay cut to work in defense, but I was highly motivated by the mission, the opportunity to work with some brilliant people on some interesting tech, and some personal history in defense. But that's hard to find. Bottom line, the DoD hires many incompetent process specialists/program managers who offer false hope of taming beastly SWE processes but in practice generate negative value.\n\nTo their credit, many individuals in the DoD recognize this situation and are working to address it. There are tech incubators like Kessel Run or DIU which focus on developing tech talent within the DoD in addition to acting as trailblazers for adopting new technology and processes from private industry. But they are a drop in the bucket compared to the scale of Big Army or Big Air Force software development. \n\n> Reading your comment sparked something I hadn't considered though, which is that the military could create a pipeline where you enlist, learn to code, spend a term coding directly for the military, then have an option to transition into reserves where you can get that private sector paycheck while still being engaged with the military.\n\nI have been advocating for this for years, but there isn't much interest from the DoD. They lack the existing officers and staff required to run such a program, so they can't get one started easily, but they won't get the officers and staff until they have a program in place. Alternatively, temporarily embedding active duty personnel with select, high-performing civilian contractors might work. The contractors would get free or substantially subsidized labor with some subject matter expertise, and the DoD would get high quality training for its personnel to build the talent pool for a software MOS I recall some discussion of that approach a few years ago, but I'm not sure if it ever came to fruition.\n\n> If you want to code, why on earth would you enlist and put up with all the downsides of military culture vs going to a tech company with well into six figures starting salary, stock incentives that will likely double your income, and perks/lifestyle that's incomparable to military life.\n\nHaving made this exact choice and then later unmade it, I couldn't agree more. It was difficult to afford living in a large city to commute to a secure facility while being paid government wages (without any of the other perks of government employment too... during the pandemic we were considered essential personnel and were required to work in-person, but we did not qualify for early vaccination because we did not receive our healthcare from the DoD). I was and am passionate about the work and the mission, and there are opportunities to work with incredibly cool technology that you will just never get in the private sector. When I was just an engineer, I loved the work I did. So it's not all bad. It was only once I had to take a leadership position and deal with idiots outside of my company that I started to dislike the job on a daily basis. It was only during the pandemic when I had to spend 30 hours per week on Zoom calls with said idiots compared to maybe 2.5 pre-pandemic that I really burned out and decided to move on.\n\nIf the DoD stopped trying to artificially restrict wages to some mediocre level designed to keep everyone across the entire federal government feeling warm and fuzzy, that alone could solve the problem. I would've tolerated more bullshit if I was being paid commensurately. They don't even need to pay true market rates, just more than a literal fraction of the private sector. My salary literally tripled when I left defense, and I wasn't even badly paid for a DoD SWE. If DoD focused on cutting out the useless layers of process, that would have spared me those awful Zoom calls and I would have stayed. If they worked more to in-house software talent, it might not have affected my specific decision-making, but it would mean that they aren't as dependent on people like me. We'll see if they ever pursue any of these options, but I am cynical about the odds, TBH.",

And I had a great team doing some really remarkably interesting and impactful work. Dealing with end users was also a pleasure, because they were often highly experienced veterans with expertise in the subject matter. But in between my team and those end users were many layers of incompetent go-betweens, who inserted themselves into whatever processes they could to justify their salary. A few of these were government employees, but that was actually quite rare. Most of the federal employees I dealt with were committed to their work and cared deeply about the end result.</p>\n\n<p>The bulk of the shiftless deadweight came from the big contractors, who make endless promises about how their expertise in program management will add magical fairy dust to a software development program for a better final result, without ever explaining how taking budget away from the extremely limited quantity of SWEs available would enhance anything at all (Leidos IME is the worst at this, that entire company can burn in the shitter as far as I am concerned). These are the sorts of people who promote SAFe Agile and other bullshit cargo culting practices as the silver bullet to DoD&#39;s software problems. SAFe and similarly bastardized versions of Agile appeal to the DoD because they do not want to take any risk on at all and instead prefer waterfall. SAFe just repackages waterfall into something labeled Agile that in no way resembles actual Agile development. The DoD supporters of these processes don&#39;t realize that requirements risk is irreducible. There is no way to avoid misspecifying requirements in advance so any software dev process must adapt to changing requirements quickly, without any onerous change orders or bureaucracy. Otherwise, you will simply end up with a shitty piece of software that probably does not do what it is supposed to do, or if it does, it does so poorly and in a manner carefully designed to meet the minimum requirements precisely as worded, regardless of the impact on end users.</p>\n\n<p>IME, the best way to develop software is to get the engineers talking directly to users as much as possible while still giving the them solid chunks of deep focus time. Otherwise an expensive game of telephone ensues, where some set of intermediaries collect requirements, evaluate the software for meeting those requirements, and communicate defects to the engineers. Even the language of defects represents a counterproductive culture more concerned with placing blame than with improving outcomes. Practically by definition, these analysts are less able to translate the feedback from users into actual software, and generally just introduce noise into the process because they are not able to effectively understand either the users or the engineers as well as the two groups understand themselves. DoD has in general taken the telephone approach, throwing tons of labor into job categories that are effectively business analysts or process managers like scrum masters who actively erect obstacles between engineers and users. I believe this is primarily driven by the labor costs. DoD and government generally are limited in terms of what they can pay per hour for labor. Ironically, even though budget may be available on a project, it can&#39;t be spent on more engineering talent because at some point the DoD exhausts the relatively small part of the market willing to work for what are pretty awful wages. So instead they redirect those funds toward process management. Real SWE talent is expensive, and typically demands well above the rates that the government can pay. Either only extremely low quality or especially motivated engineers will work for the DoD as a result.</p>\n\n<p>I had to take a massive pay cut to work in defense, but I was highly motivated by the mission, the opportunity to work with some brilliant people on some interesting tech, and some personal history in defense. But that&#39;s hard to find. Bottom line, the DoD hires many incompetent process specialists/program managers who offer false hope of taming beastly SWE processes but in practice generate negative value.</p>\n\n<p>To their credit, many individuals in the DoD recognize this situation and are working to address it. There are tech incubators like Kessel Run or DIU which focus on developing tech talent within the DoD in addition to acting as trailblazers for adopting new technology and processes from private industry. But they are a drop in the bucket compared to the scale of Big Army or Big Air Force software development. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Reading your comment sparked something I hadn&#39;t considered though, which is that the military could create a pipeline where you enlist, learn to code, spend a term coding directly for the military, then have an option to transition into reserves where you can get that private sector paycheck while still being engaged with the military.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have been advocating for this for years, but there isn&#39;t much interest from the DoD. They lack the existing officers and staff required to run such a program, so they can&#39;t get one started easily, but they won&#39;t get the officers and staff until they have a program in place. Alternatively, temporarily embedding active duty personnel with select, high-performing civilian contractors might work. The contractors would get free or substantially subsidized labor with some subject matter expertise, and the DoD would get high quality training for its personnel to build the talent pool for a software MOS I recall some discussion of that approach a few years ago, but I&#39;m not sure if it ever came to fruition.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you want to code, why on earth would you enlist and put up with all the downsides of military culture vs going to a tech company with well into six figures starting salary, stock incentives that will likely double your income, and perks/lifestyle that&#39;s incomparable to military life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Having made this exact choice and then later unmade it, I couldn&#39;t agree more. It was difficult to afford living in a large city to commute to a secure facility while being paid government wages (without any of the other perks of government employment too... during the pandemic we were considered essential personnel and were required to work in-person, but we did not qualify for early vaccination because we did not receive our healthcare from the DoD). I was and am passionate about the work and the mission, and there are opportunities to work with incredibly cool technology that you will just never get in the private sector. When I was just an engineer, I loved the work I did. So it&#39;s not all bad. It was only once I had to take a leadership position and deal with idiots outside of my company that I started to dislike the job on a daily basis. It was only during the pandemic when I had to spend 30 hours per week on Zoom calls with said idiots compared to maybe 2.5 pre-pandemic that I really burned out and decided to move on.</p>\n\n<p>If the DoD stopped trying to artificially restrict wages to some mediocre level designed to keep everyone across the entire federal government feeling warm and fuzzy, that alone could solve the problem. I would&#39;ve tolerated more bullshit if I was being paid commensurately. They don&#39;t even need to pay true market rates, just more than a literal fraction of the private sector. My salary literally tripled when I left defense, and I wasn&#39;t even badly paid for a DoD SWE. If DoD focused on cutting out the useless layers of process, that would have spared me those awful Zoom calls and I would have stayed. If they worked more to in-house software talent, it might not have affected my specific decision-making, but it would mean that they aren&#39;t as dependent on people like me. We&#39;ll see if they ever pursue any of these options, but I am cynical about the odds, TBH.</p>\n</div>",

And as you noted, that was after years of direct wartime experience and practice with other smaller scale but still similar operations. Also worth noting that by that point the allies had pretty solid air superiority and naval superiority over the axis forces, and that was also a time period when things like precision munitions and anti-ship missiles weren't an issue that an attacker had to worry about. Then you add in other things like satellite imagery, drones, much better radar systems than existed in WWII, and it's going to be basically impossible for the Chinese military to gain any real element of surprise in an attack.\n\nAlso the Germans had to defend a much larger coastline from potential invasion, and due to extensive deception and counter-intelligence efforts, the Germans were expecting the landings to occur somewhere else. I'm certainly not an expert on this, but from what I've read, there's apparently only a relatively small portion of Taiwan's coastline that's really suited for attempting an amphibious assault, so China's options are more limited, which makes defensive preparations easier. \n\nIt would be an super complicated and difficult operation to pull off for anybody, and yeah the PLA doesn't have much in terms of prior experience to build off of. Also probably worth noting that if we assume that Taiwan actually fights back and doesn't immediately surrender, the fighting is very likely going to destroy a huge amount of the buildings/infrastructure/etc. on the island, sending further economic shockwaves globally. \n\nWhen you consider that the most valuable economic piece of Taiwan is a bunch of super high-tech stuff like microchip manufacturing, if that gets destroyed/sabotaged over the course of the fighting, then a lot of the economic value that China could potentially get from conquering it goes right out the window.

Heading south from Vuhledar runs into uphill fortifications near Volnovakha that look mighty impressive to me, plus a necessary river crossing at the current zero line.
