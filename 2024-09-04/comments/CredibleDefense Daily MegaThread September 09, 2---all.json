As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

Ukraine has lost 68 tanks (45 destroyed) to Russia's 84 (66 destroyed), 23 MLRS/artillery (16 destroyed) to Russia's 72 (64 destroyed), 6 trucks to Russia's 65, and 2 ADS to Russia's 15.

That being said, there's potentially a large caveat in that many Russian FPV and Lancet hits aren't being counted as the damage done and the vehicle being hit are often unclear from the footage provided, which might significantly impact loss counts.

        "body": "\nPLA Social Media Warfare and the Cognitive Domain\n\nhttps://jamestown.org/program/pla-social-media-warfare-and-the-cognitive-domain/\n\nThe People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) has come to recognize the important role of social media in modern conflict and peacetime operations. As such, PLA researchers have begun using the term \u201csocial media warfare\u201d (\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u6218) to describe the extension of non-kinetic military activities onto social media by two or more opposing sides. This term is part of an ongoing conceptual expansion of the scope of warfare in Chinese military thought in which social media is viewed as another space for conflict and not just another channel for distributing propaganda. While the term \u201csocial media warfare\u201d does not represent PLA doctrine, its emergence does indicate that the Chinese military finds these activities important enough to raise awareness of them amongst its rank and file. Together with other evidence, this suggests the PLA is working to better incorporate social media into its operations.\n\nThis article provides an overview of PLA thinking on social media warfare, including its emergence in PLA literature, its theoretical basis, and PLA lessons derived from observations of foreign examples of social media\u2019s role in modern warfare. This article does not seek to provide a comprehensive review of PLA thinking about social media\u2019s role in military operations, but outlines one part of this conceptual view.\n\nOverview\n\nEmergence in PLA Literature\u00a0\n\nThe earliest mention of social media warfare can be traced back to a 2015\u00a0PLA Daily\u00a0that examined social media\u2019s role in global events such as Iran\u2019s 2009 Green Revolution and the Arab Spring protests in 2011.\u00a0[1]\u00a0This timeline aligns with broader PLA awareness of social media, especially insofar as it poses a risk to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).\u00a0[2]\u00a0The article emphasizes that, due to the key role of online communication in inciting protests and garnering rebel support, both of these cases represent some of the earliest examples in which social media has had a direct impact on national security, which the CCP defines as encompassing both internal and external security interests.\u00a0[3]\u00a02015 was also the year that the PLA National Defense University\u2019s\u00a0Science of Military Strategy\u00a0included its first reference to social media, warning that \u201cSince the beginning of the 21st century, cyberspace has been used by some countries to launch \u2018color revolutions\u2019 against other countries\u2026 [through] behind-the-scenes operations using social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook as the engine, from manufacturing network public opinion to inciting social unrest.\u201d\u00a0[4]\n\nThe origin of the PLA\u2019s interest in social media thus appears to be primarily defensive, focusing on protecting the CCP regime, rather than offensive, as constituing part of military operations. Given that China was being confronted with similar protests in Tibet (2008) and Xinjiang (2009) around the time this thinking developed, social media\u2019s role in catalyzing the above protests was likely of great concern to the CCP and thus the PLA.\u00a0[5]\u00a0However, the PLA\u2019s awareness of and interest in the power and potential of social media has evolved to now seeing it as a component of modern military operations.\n\nIn recent years, this evolution has been marked by references in PLA literature to the use of social media in the US military. For example, in response to the release of the Pentagon\u2019s first force-wide social media policy, a 2022\u00a0China National Defense\u00a0article warns that this indicates a desire to formalize social media\u2019s \u201cweaponization.\u201d\u00a0[6]\u00a0Another 2022 article from the same publication argues that in the past this \u201cweaponization\u201d has involved impersonating refugees who fled from authoritarian regimes to discredit said governments, and that these efforts will only become more effective with the use of artificial intelligence (AI).\u00a0[7]\n\nTheoretical Basis\n\nDeconstructing the term \u201csocial media warfare\u201d according to PLA military theory sheds more light on conceptual content. Generally speaking,\u00a0warfare\u00a0(\u6218) in PLA military theory is used to describe intentionally executed military operations, whereas words like\u00a0confrontation\u00a0(\u5bf9\u6297) or\u00a0struggle\u00a0(\u6597\u4e89) may just refer to existing conditions between two parties.\u00a0[8]\u00a0By this logic, \u201csocial media warfare\u201d can be defined as operations taking place in, on, or through social media. However, as previously stated, this is certainly not yet a doctrinal concept, and is simply being used to describe and raise awareness of a burgeoning issue. \u00a0 due to its lack of doctrinal status.\n\nSocial Media and Its Relationship with Combat Operations\n\nSocial media arguably has an increasingly well-defined place within the PLA\u2019s concept of operations. In the context of the information age, the PLA points to \u201ccommand of information\u201d (\u5236\u4fe1\u606f\u6743) as the key to gaining the advantage over an adversary on the battlefield.\u00a0[9]\u00a0As social media\u2019s place in society has become more ingrained, social media warfare has become one of the avenues for the PLA to conduct information operations to seize this command of information. While some PLA researchers have described social media as a domain of warfare, it is more commonly viewed as a channel for PLA information operations,\u00a0[10]\u00a0or as a subset of either the information domain or the nascent cognitive domain (\u8ba4\u77e5\u57df).\u00a0[11]\n\nSocial media\u2019s rise in importance has come during an evolution of the PLA\u2019s approach to information and influence operations. Since the early 2000s, the PLA\u2019s approach has centered on the \u201cThree Warfares\u201d (\u4e09\u6218), namely psychological warfare (\u5fc3\u7406\u6218), public opinion warfare (\u8206\u8bba\u6218), and legal warfare (\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6218).\u00a0[12]\u00a0However, there is a growing interest in a new PLA operational concept, \u201c\u00a0 (\u8ba4\u77e5\u57df\u4f5c\u6218), as part of a broader PLA evolution to leveraging the cognitive domain as a domain of warfare.\n\nCognitive domain operations (CDO) seek to influence the decision-making of an adversary during wartime \u2014 or the public opinion of a target audience during peacetime \u2014 with the goal of attaining\u00a0command of the mind\u00a0(\u5236\u8111\u6743) or\u00a0command of cognition\u00a0(\u5236\u8ba4\u77e5\u6743).\u00a0[13]\u00a0Far from being confined to PLA theory, CDO appears to be the PLA operational concept behind some real-world operations, most notably political interference against Taiwan. Social media was specifically listed as the key channel for CDO activity against Taiwan in a 2018 article by researchers at Base 311, the PLA\u2019s Strategic Support Force (PLASSF) unit responsible for influence operations against Taiwan.\u00a0\n\n1/2",

This article does not seek to provide a comprehensive review of PLA thinking about social media\u2019s role in military operations, but outlines one part of this conceptual view.</p>\n\n<p>Overview</p>\n\n<p>Emergence in PLA Literature\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The earliest mention of social media warfare can be traced back to a 2015\u00a0PLA Daily\u00a0that examined social media\u2019s role in global events such as Iran\u2019s 2009 Green Revolution and the Arab Spring protests in 2011.\u00a0[1]\u00a0This timeline aligns with broader PLA awareness of social media, especially insofar as it poses a risk to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).\u00a0[2]\u00a0The article emphasizes that, due to the key role of online communication in inciting protests and garnering rebel support, both of these cases represent some of the earliest examples in which social media has had a direct impact on national security, which the CCP defines as encompassing both internal and external security interests.\u00a0[3]\u00a02015 was also the year that the PLA National Defense University\u2019s\u00a0Science of Military Strategy\u00a0included its first reference to social media, warning that \u201cSince the beginning of the 21st century, cyberspace has been used by some countries to launch \u2018color revolutions\u2019 against other countries\u2026 [through] behind-the-scenes operations using social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook as the engine, from manufacturing network public opinion to inciting social unrest.\u201d\u00a0[4]</p>\n\n<p>The origin of the PLA\u2019s interest in social media thus appears to be primarily defensive, focusing on protecting the CCP regime, rather than offensive, as constituing part of military operations. Given that China was being confronted with similar protests in Tibet (2008) and Xinjiang (2009) around the time this thinking developed, social media\u2019s role in catalyzing the above protests was likely of great concern to the CCP and thus the PLA.\u00a0[5]\u00a0However, the PLA\u2019s awareness of and interest in the power and potential of social media has evolved to now seeing it as a component of modern military operations.</p>\n\n<p>In recent years, this evolution has been marked by references in PLA literature to the use of social media in the US military. For example, in response to the release of the Pentagon\u2019s first force-wide social media policy, a 2022\u00a0China National Defense\u00a0article warns that this indicates a desire to formalize social media\u2019s \u201cweaponization.\u201d\u00a0[6]\u00a0Another 2022 article from the same publication argues that in the past this \u201cweaponization\u201d has involved impersonating refugees who fled from authoritarian regimes to discredit said governments, and that these efforts will only become more effective with the use of artificial intelligence (AI).\u00a0[7]</p>\n\n<p>Theoretical Basis</p>\n\n<p>Deconstructing the term \u201csocial media warfare\u201d according to PLA military theory sheds more light on conceptual content. Generally speaking,\u00a0warfare\u00a0(\u6218) in PLA military theory is used to describe intentionally executed military operations, whereas words like\u00a0confrontation\u00a0(\u5bf9\u6297) or\u00a0struggle\u00a0(\u6597\u4e89) may just refer to existing conditions between two parties.\u00a0[8]\u00a0By this logic, \u201csocial media warfare\u201d can be defined as operations taking place in, on, or through social media. However, as previously stated, this is certainly not yet a doctrinal concept, and is simply being used to describe and raise awareness of a burgeoning issue. \u00a0 due to its lack of doctrinal status.</p>\n\n<p>Social Media and Its Relationship with Combat Operations</p>\n\n<p>Social media arguably has an increasingly well-defined place within the PLA\u2019s concept of operations. In the context of the information age, the PLA points to \u201ccommand of information\u201d (\u5236\u4fe1\u606f\u6743) as the key to gaining the advantage over an adversary on the battlefield.\u00a0[9]\u00a0As social media\u2019s place in society has become more ingrained, social media warfare has become one of the avenues for the PLA to conduct information operations to seize this command of information. While some PLA researchers have described social media as a domain of warfare, it is more commonly viewed as a channel for PLA information operations,\u00a0[10]\u00a0or as a subset of either the information domain or the nascent cognitive domain (\u8ba4\u77e5\u57df).\u00a0[11]</p>\n\n<p>Social media\u2019s rise in importance has come during an evolution of the PLA\u2019s approach to information and influence operations. Since the early 2000s, the PLA\u2019s approach has centered on the \u201cThree Warfares\u201d (\u4e09\u6218), namely psychological warfare (\u5fc3\u7406\u6218), public opinion warfare (\u8206\u8bba\u6218), and legal warfare (\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6218).\u00a0[12]\u00a0However, there is a growing interest in a new PLA operational concept, \u201c\u00a0 (\u8ba4\u77e5\u57df\u4f5c\u6218), as part of a broader PLA evolution to leveraging the cognitive domain as a domain of warfare.</p>\n\n<p>Cognitive domain operations (CDO) seek to influence the decision-making of an adversary during wartime \u2014 or the public opinion of a target audience during peacetime \u2014 with the goal of attaining\u00a0command of the mind\u00a0(\u5236\u8111\u6743) or\u00a0command of cognition\u00a0(\u5236\u8ba4\u77e5\u6743).\u00a0[13]\u00a0Far from being confined to PLA theory, CDO appears to be the PLA operational concept behind some real-world operations, most notably political interference against Taiwan. Social media was specifically listed as the key channel for CDO activity against Taiwan in a 2018 article by researchers at Base 311, the PLA\u2019s Strategic Support Force (PLASSF) unit responsible for influence operations against Taiwan.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>1/2</p>\n</div>",

            "body": "PLA Lessons Learned from Foreign Operational Examples\n\nA survey of PLA literature suggests that China\u2019s understanding of social media warfare comes just as much from the experiences of other countries as it does from its own. Taking a closer look at the lessons derived from these observations may therefore offer a more holistic perspective of the PLA\u2019s view of this term. The following section explores three operational examples, the 2003 Iraq War, the 2014 Gaza War, and the 2020 Second Nagorno-Karabakh War.\n\n2003 Iraq War\n\nPLA researchers point to the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the United States as the earliest example of social media warfare, despite social media not yet existing at the time. A 2020 PLA Daily article discusses United States messaging prior to the invasion using this framing, [15] marking a change from earlier discussions in which the Iraq War served instead as an example of public opinion warfare. [16] Some PLA researchers have framed the Iraq War as an example of both, suggesting that these PLA researchers are in some ways recycling traditional views of IO under the newer concept of social media warfare. [17] This tallies with Western research identifying Operation Iraqi Freedom as a major inspiration for PLA information warfare. [18] Given the overlap between the two, lessons drawn from public opinion warfare can still provide insight into PLA thinking on social media warfare.\n\nIn the 2020 PLA Daily article, the author, Zhang Hui, argues that the United States exerted tremendous effort to make the war a bipartisan issue by using various media outlets to popularize the rumor that Saddam Hussein had colluded with Osama bin-Laden and that Iraq was in possession of weapons of mass destruction. By shifting the narrative in its favor, Zhang argues, the United States was able to operate in Iraq without many domestic political constraints.  This represents an early iteration of the public opinion influence emphasized in CDO and highlights the PLA awareness of the role of public opinion in the will to fight (and specifically the United States as a potential future adversary). The article emphasizes that information dissemination and public opinion influence must be incorporated into the military\u2019s combat capability construction (\u6218\u6597\u529b\u5efa\u8bbe), so that these capabilities can be developed in tandem with traditional capabilities. [19] The creation of the PLASSF in late 2015 can in some ways be considered a reflection of this sentiment, as it is charged with the integration of cyber, electronic, psychological, and other capabilities associated with informatized conflict and joint operations. [20]\n\n2014 Gaza War\n\nThe 2014 Gaza War was a month-long conflict launched by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) against the Hamas-governed Gaza Strip and is one of many examples of the PLA learning from the Israeli military\u2019s embrace of social media, specifically by dedicating forces to social media operations: A 2023 Military Correspondent article points out that the IDF had a division dedicated to gathering the materials needed to conduct influence operations on social media before the conflict even began. This included biographical information on Hamas leaders, instances of Hamas causing collateral damage by using non-military infrastructure as cover, and instances of Israel trying to avoid civilian casualties. All of these aided Israel\u2019s efforts to shift public opinion in its favor. After the fighting started, both sides engaged in psychological warfare on social media, with Israel posting the photo of a bloodied, high-ranking Hamas military leader and Hamas responding with a post dismissing \u201cIsrael\u2019s \u2018Iron Dome\u2019 missile defense system as a \u2018paper tiger,\u2019\u201d and warning that IDF had \u201copened the gates of hell.\u201d [21] In the PLA researcher\u2019s view, Israel adopted a two-pronged approach to social media warfare that attempted to simultaneously influence public opinion and degrade the enemy\u2019s will to fight. This aligns with other PLA writings documenting the United States leveraging ISIS postings on social media as intelligence collection to improve targeting for better kinetic strikes. [22] By focusing on the IDF\u2019s preparedness for this conflict, the article emphasizes the need to \u201cfurther establish a professional social media informatization unit\u201d within the Chinese military. [23] The PLA has undoubtedly relied on the expertise of specialized units within the PLASSF, including Base 311, reflecting an emphasis on the role of social media as a space for CDO in both peacetime competition and future conflict.\n\n2020 Second Nagorno-Karabakh War\n\nPLA Daily published an article in 2020 following the outbreak of the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War, a territorial dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The piece highlighted the reliance of both sides on social media to accomplish their operational objectives. Throughout the conflict, both sides attempted to confuse enemy decision-making by posting false claims on official accounts about having destroyed certain targets. Azerbaijan also conducted \u201cmental attacks\u201d (\u7cbe\u795e\u6253\u51fb) [24] by posting photos of targets that had been destroyed and enemy supply lines being seized in an effort to embolden their own soldiers and degrade Armenia\u2019s will to fight. The article ends by noting that the influence of social media in this conflict \u201csurpassed even the actual war.\u201d [25] This article suggests that at least some in the PLA believe social media\u2019s utility can go beyond merely supporting traditional kinetic capabilities and instead play a decisive role in a conflict. As the PLA continues to emphasize the conceptual expansion of conflict from the material domain to the cognitive domain, such observations may increase the prominence of social media in future operations.\n\nConclusion\n\nSocial media\u2019s increasing significance as a space for non-kinetic military operations has undoubtedly grasped the attention of PLA scholars, who have emphasized the importance of incorporating social media with traditional military capabilities and having military units dedicated to operations on social media, and the potential for it to play a decisive role in operations by complementing kinetic strikes. As the role of social media in modern warfare becomes increasingly well-defined within the PLA\u2019s concept of operations, this new vector of warfare will likely become a more common framing construct for how the PLA thinks about social media and methods of raising awareness for its troops to better leverage social media to China\u2019s advantage in peacetime competition and future conflicts. Ultimately, the concept of \u201csocial media warfare\u201d is likely to remain more theoretical, as CDOs serve as the PLA\u2019s primary operational concept for leveraging social media. However, one key indicator to watch for how the PLA thinks about social media moving forward will be its discussion in future revisions of the Science of Military Strategy.\n\n2/2",

If the reaction is swift, severe and punishing towards the offender then the nuclear taboo might be re-established, as nations conclude that using nuclear weapons in this manner is not worth the cost. If the reaction is instead muted or worse to reward the offender for using nuclear weapons, then the risk of future nuclear blackmail, escalation, or war increases dramatically. \n\nAfter all if you have nuclear weapons and your neighbor does not, just go ahead and threaten them with them, and if they don\u2019t give you what you want just go ahead and nuke them. If it worked for the Russians, why wouldn\u2019t it work for you as well?\n\nSo unless you want such a future to unfold you are basically forced to escalate in the face of nuclear usage. If you back down you are just guaranteeing that you will end up in exactly the same situation again, either from Russia or some other nation deciding they\u2019re gonna try the same gambit. No one is going to believe that they will be punished for it if Russia isn\u2019t.\n\nSo if the goal for Russia is to de-escalate then using nuclear weapons is probably the worst thing they could do, in my opinion. I expect that we will see the trend continue where even Great Power nations prefer losing wars (Vietnam, Afghanistan) or ending up in a stalemate (Korea) over risking the consequences of breaking the nuclear taboo.",

If it worked for the Russians, why wouldn\u2019t it work for you as well?</p>\n\n<p>So unless you want such a future to unfold you are basically forced to escalate in the face of nuclear usage. If you back down you are just guaranteeing that you will end up in exactly the same situation again, either from Russia or some other nation deciding they\u2019re gonna try the same gambit. No one is going to believe that they will be punished for it if Russia isn\u2019t.</p>\n\n<p>So if the goal for Russia is to de-escalate then using nuclear weapons is probably the worst thing they could do, in my opinion. I expect that we will see the trend continue where even Great Power nations prefer losing wars (Vietnam, Afghanistan) or ending up in a stalemate (Korea) over risking the consequences of breaking the nuclear taboo.</p>\n</div>",

Attacking NK would certainly be easier, as they're surrounded and they've been starved out for 300 ish days now, and it would cause no intervention from outside of the region.\n\nOn the other hand, I'm not sure Azerbaijan believes there'll be intervention even if they do try and annex land within Armenia.  In the 2022 border fights, they took several Armenian hills, which in and of itself didn't seem like a lot but it did demonstrate to them that taking and holding land in Armenia would not trigger a response from the CSTO or the west, which it didn't.

Since 2020 the peacekeepers assigned to the region have been... lackluster.  A few times since 2020 Azerbaijan would shell something or even nab a village on the demarcator line with the peacekeeper response being \"damn that's crazy\".\n\nThen about a year ago, the Azeris started blockading the Lachin corridor (the thing the peacekeepers are explicitly there to protect), which is the main complaint against the peacekeepers.\n\nAs another thing, Armenians claim that Russia hasn't really sold them any new weapons or ammo since 2020 as part of a silent agreement with Turkey.  While this is mostly a rumour, it is true that Armenia's been recently (even before the Ukraine war) buying a lot of gear from India, which would be a pretty weird thing to do for no reason considering previously weapons came overwhelmingly from Russia.  And I'm not really finding any evidence of major sales since then, which is a little bit odd considering pre-2020 we were talking like 80% of Armenian weapons were Russian.\n\nPlus, the CSTO is (at least on paper) a pretty robust defensive organization, with their own article 5 kind of thing.  So it's one thing that they don't care about Nagorno-Karabakh (since it's de jure not Armenian), but when Azerbaijan made advances and took land **inside** Armenia in 2022 and the CSTO also went, \"damn, that's crazy\", that was a big eye opener.\n\nThat's on the ground.  In the rhetoric field, there are also areas of disillusionment.  One example - some Kremlin propagandists say Armenia should try normalization with Azerbaijan.  OK!  Pashinyan about a year ago said \"he's open to recognizing Azerbaijan's territorial integrity\" (i.e. open to unambiguously returning Nagorno-Karabakh).  Russia's response?  Well, the Kremlin this week responds by saying \"oh, the reason our peacekeepers are having a hard time doing their job is because you agreed to recognize Azerbaijan's territorial integrity\".\n\n...\n\nWhile your perception of this rhetoric may be different, it seems like literally getting jerked around.  That's certainly how it seems to Pashinyan and plenty of Armenians.  And getting jerked around by what was ostensibly your primary and only ally is also an eye opener.\n\nSo no, I'd say Armenians (including Pashinyan) are rightfully perceiving Russia as pivoting towards Azerbaijan, and that this pivot precedes the Ukraine war. \n\n>Armenia\u2019s recent comments about reliance on Russia being an error cause this by justifying Russia\u2019s backing out and hence emboldening the Azeris?\n\nI mean, he made those comments as Azerbaijan began their military buildup, probably in response to the buildup and the near possibility of war.

At expense of Eastern Europe sovereignty of course, cause Kremlin top brass is mentally stuck in mid XX century.</p>\n\n<p>Also Russian pivot to China is a joke to everyone that has a slightest experience in international business.</p>\n</div>",
