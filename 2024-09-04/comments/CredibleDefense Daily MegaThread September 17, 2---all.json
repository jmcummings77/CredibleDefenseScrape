As such, submissions are less stringently moderated, but we still do keep an elevated guideline for comments.\n\n  Comment guidelines:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Be curious not judgmental,\n\n\\* Be polite and civil,\n\n\\* Use the original title of the work you are linking to,\n\n\\* Use capitalization,\n\n\\* Link to the article or source of information that you are referring to,\n\n\\* Make it clear what is your opinion and from what the source actually says. Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.' Questions, like other kinds of comments, should be supported by evidence and must maintain the burden of credibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease read our in depth rules [https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules](https://reddit.com/r/CredibleDefense/wiki/rules). \n\n\n\nAlso please use the report feature if you want a comment to be reviewed faster.

I can see precision guided munitions for air-to-ground sorties, air defense systems, and cruise missile strikes against strategic targets, sure. But basic munitions, artillery, even fighting vehicles and tanks I doubt will run out, but in lower capabilities is certainly going to be true. Yet its exactly these weapons which Ukraine is struggling against in Zaporizhzhia. Russian marines aren't exactly par shock units as they're seen in the United States military, especially after the severe casualties they've suffered in Summer/Fall 2022. The 1st Guards Tank Army was rendered nearly entirely combat ineffective after the counteroffensives around Lyman & Izyum. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nYet Ukraine still has been struggling the most against the conscript units in Zaporizhzhia, especially since they've been given time to dig in and fortify themselves. An oversimplification of Russian doctrine for nearly the past century would say that they overwhelmingly prefer an underequipped and undertrained soldier to no soldier at all. Russia is willing to sustain these casualties, and the ability for Russia to indefinitely rotate in and out fresh units, even if poor in quality makes it difficult to progress. The most effective offensive operations in modern warfare occur when the defending side does not have enough reserves or is incapable of mobilizing them quickly or effectively enough, which Russia does not seem to be struggling with as of yet. Will the quality decrease as the war goes on? Yes, but relegated to the ground war, I don't believe it'll be as major of a deal as its made out to be. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs far as the economy goes, I think Russia has completely accepted that they will hurt severely, and they're entirely fine with that going forwards. Many countries hurt severely during WW1/WW2, Vietnam hurt severely during the Vietnam War, and so many more examples yet they continued to fight anyways. Russia will surely feel the effects of this war for several decades, but I think its clear that the Kremlin has accepted this and chosen to proceed anyways and/or believe that folding in the Ukraine War to be a worse outcome anyway. As far as I'm aware, the current effects on the economy will not boil to a point which causes severe domestic unrest as far as living standards go, but it will hurt their war production, specifically in higher tech munitions like drones, PGMs, aircraft production and repair, and production of new fighting vehicles. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n> Objectives include disrupting Russia's comfort zone, causing psychological impact, and disrupting economic processes.\n\nThis is probably one of the best routes for Ukraine.

[Idle refining capacity in Russia remains unusually high as well](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/russias-offline-oil-refining-capacity-to-jump-44-in-sept-sources-calculations), reportedly because of seasonal maintenance efforts but who knows if that's true since the information is coming from state-owned Russian entities. I would guess a lot of that idling is actually because of the lost demand for refined Russian petroleum products in Europe, whereas much of the remaining demand for Russian petroleum is for crude rather than finished products. But ultimately that means they have more than enough capacity to produce all the diesel they need for the war effort and to meet their own domestic demand for power generation, and probably so much more capacity available than is required to meet demand that attacking that infrastructure is not likely to benefit Ukraine enough to justify the high resource commitment required to make it work at scale.\n\nWhich isn't to say that attacking critical links in the power and petroleum distribution networks won't cause localized issues with power generation and supply. For example, the Ukrainians retook the Boiko Towers gas platforms in the Black Sea last week. [Those platforms provided the gas for the two primary power plants in Crimea](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2022/09/12/7367139/), and so we are likely to see an increasingly difficult energy supply situation in the peninsula over the next few weeks.

They can't sustain a conflict against the Islamists alone, let alone bring Azawad back under government control at the same time. Therefore, they need some sort of international backing to combat them effectively.\n\nThe obvious answer would be to obtain the assistance of ECOWAS - the West African regional bloc, but they were suspended from the organization as a consequence of overthrowing the internationally recognized government in the 2021 coup. Furthermore, they have threatened to intervene if ECOWAS attempts to remove the recently-established junta in the neighbouring state of Niger, which would put ECOWAS troops in direct conflict with Malian troops. So ECOWAS is not willing to help Mali out against the Islamists, even though they have an obvious interest in containing and defeating them. \n\nThere's a similar situation with France. France has a checkered reputation in West Africa because it treated its colonial subjects in the region (including what is now Mali) poorly, but retained economic and diplomatic ties with countries in the region. More war in the Sahel means more refugees coming into northern Africa and Europe, so European countries have a similar interest in suppressing the Islamists before the insurgency grows in scale to the point of threatening major population centres. The Malian, Burkinabe, and Nigerien countries were willing to let France help out - but post-coups, the juntas in all three Sahel states leveraged anti-French sentiment to justify their coups and basically give France the middle finger [(this is ongoing)](https://www.dw.com/en/macron-says-frances-niger-ambassador-a-hostage-in-embassy/a-66829045). France already withdrew its units from military bases in Mali, so it's unlikely they will be helping out anytime soon.\n\nSo seeing that they are suffering the consequences of their escalatory rhetoric towards their former partners, that leaves the Malian junta the Wagner Group - functionally a Russian expeditionary and resource extraction force - as the only viable option. With the death of Prigozhin and Utkin, Wagner appears to be fully aligned with the Russian MoD. They also fight very similarly to Russian military units, happy to commit war crimes and massacres *en masse* in rural localities alongside the Malian army under the junta, while still being worshipped by the junta and local supporters in Bamako who view them as anti-colonialist (because while they are the only remaining European colonial state in Central Asia and Siberia, they never had any holdings in Africa). The net result is state-sanctioned violence, and even then, Wagner's reliability as a partner in combating Islamists is unstable due to the diversion of Russian military attention and resources to Ukraine.\n\nYou could probably replace Mali with Burkina Faso in the above text, and it'll still be 90% accurate.",

[Per ISW's daily update from August 31](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-august-31-2023):\n\n> Russian authorities arrested a notable fringe ultranationalist Russian milblogger on accusations of discrediting the Russian military, likely as part of centralized efforts to silence some critical milblogger voices without prompting a general backlash. Russian authorities arrested Andrei Kurshin, who reportedly runs the Telegram channel \u201cMoscow Calling,\u201d on August 31 but did not specify what content Kurshin posted that prompted the charges.[9] The \u201cMoscow Calling\u201d channel routinely criticizes Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) and notably commonly attacks many aspects of Russia\u2019s military conduct of the war in Ukraine while supporting the ultranationalist goals underpinning the war itself. \n\n[And from September 2](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-september-2-2023):\n\n> Prominent Russian milbloggers likely have a monetary incentive to regularly report information about the war in Ukraine that is uncritical of Russian authorities. BBC reported on September 1 that prominent Russian milbloggers claimed that they can make between about 48,000 and 188,000 rubles (about $500 to 1,950) per advertisement on their Telegram channels.[16] BBC reported that an advertising agent working with Wagner-affiliated channels claimed that a prominent Wagner Group-affiliated source made around 31,500 rubles (about $330) per advertisement.[17] The advertising agent told BBC that several employees of RIA FAN, a now-shuttered media outlet affiliated with former Wagner financier Yevgeny Prigozhin, received only about 10,500 to 21,800 rubles (about $108 to $226) per advertisement due to their lower subscriber count.[18] BBC noted that Russia\u2019s average monthly salary is about 66,000 rubles (about $685). Prominent milbloggers\u2019 monthly salaries are thus likely much higher than the Russian average. Russian milbloggers are likely economically incentivized to maintain and grow audiences through war reporting that is uncritical of Russian authorities, as criticism of the Russian authorities, resistance to attempted censorship, and potential legal problems could lead to a decrease in advertisements, although milbloggers who present themselves as telling unpleasant truths can also gain large followings. Alexander \u201cSasha\u201d Kots, a prominent milblogger who also serves on the Kremlin\u2019s Human Rights Council, claimed that milbloggers have a \u201cdirect channel to privately communicate information\u201d to the Russian MoD.[19]\n\n[And August 29](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-august-29-2023):\n\n> The Russian MoD may be reverting to the more limited coverage of the war in Ukraine while attempting to censor complaints along the frontline and reports of Ukrainian advances. The Russian MoD recently changed its daily reporting style to reduce the daily amount of information it reports on the war.[28] The Russian MoD previously issued a daily situational report that differed from the individual situational reports from the press services of each Russian grouping of forces.[29] The press services of each Russian grouping of forces issued text directly copied from the overall daily situational report instead of their own original reports on August 29, however.[30] The Russian MoD has consistently attempted to institute an information policy that would provide limited information about the frontlines throughout the war.[31] The Russian MoD\u2019s change in reporting, if this trend continues, may reflect its wider efforts to censor Russian reporting on the war and unify its own narrative.\n\nIt is therefore not surprising we aren't seeing much discussion of a potentially significant and embarrassing Russian military blunder from the Russian information space at this point. They're being pressured and bribed into staying on message for the MOD.",

[For a schematic description of a typical MRB's positions on the defense, see these diagrams](https://imgur.com/a/PQ0IU0x) borrowed from Grau's *The Russian Way of War*. There are also a couple screenshots from DeepStateMap showing the length and depth of the area recently reclaimed around Andriivka.\n\nThe area liberated around Andriivka over the past few days is around 4.5km wide by 1.5km deep. Russian MRBs typically have three battalions of infantry and one of armor for their maneuver elements. The 72nd was very unlikely to be at full strength after having suffered significant losses at Vuhledar earlier in the year, and also nearly all Russian formations have been fighting nominally under strength for the entire length of the war. So it's safe to assume they were fighting with somewhat less than the full four battalions the MRB TOE calls for. Realistically, they might have managed to form a defensive line with two battalions up front and something less than a battalion of armor/infantry in reserve. The *maximum* amount of front line that a full strength Russian battalion can ordinarily cover in the defense is 5km, typically extending across an average depth of 1-3km. Meaning if the two forward battalions in the brigade spread themselves as thin as possible, they will take up a 10km stretch of the front. If instead they are aiming for twice that force density, which would make sense because they are defending an urban position in a hotly contested sector of the front, the entire brigade would occupy around 5km of the front. As displayed in the DSM screenshots, 5km is almost exactly the breadth of the salient where the Ukrainians pushed the Russians back around Andriivka. \n\nSo it's not at all out of the realm of possibility that an entire brigade's worth of infantry were committed within that pocket and were eliminated as a result, and in fact it seems just about the right sized area for an under strength brigade to be holding. Certainly it's not so clearly unreasonable that we can dismiss the Ukrainian claims about the scale of the Russian losses out of hand.",

It was probably the only realistic choice, and not just because of proximity and history, but also because, except for a very small time window of about 10-15 years or so, between 1993-ish (around the time when it became realistic for countries in the Soviet sphere of influence to seek to join NATO) and 2007-ish or so (when Erdogan started going off the rails), it's likely that any attempt by Armenia to obtain real security guarantees and an inclusive status in NATO would've been torpedoed by Turkey. He also took as productive a stance on corruption as you can in the former Soviet space, and there has been no difficulty in reconciling the two.\n\nHowever, collaboration with the current Russian political establishment without extending the highest protection to *some* types of corruption is practically impossible. It's barely worked in Western Europe, which has the legal institutions to deal with it, acceptable \"grey zone\" practices of political lobby that offer efficient enough legal alternatives to all sorts of illegal acts, and whose ties to Russia have largely (i.e. except for countries like Austria, Hungary or Switzerland) been confined to financial and commercial partnerships.\n\nLack of transparency, lack of public oversight and lack of legal oversight are fundamental to the way the Russian government currently works. It is difficult, if not outright impossible, to deal with the Russian government in a way that excludes these things. For a recent example, just look at Wagner -- sure, \"everyone\" \"knew\" the Kremlin was behind it all along, but a lot of effort was spent maintaining plausible deniability about the ties between Wagner and the Kremlin. Keeping Wagner operations off the books was so important that there was simply no way to get security guarantees that require Wagner involvement while also maintaining a transparent legal system that could effectively oversee local Wagner operations.\n\n(It's just an example, but the principle applies everywhere else. You can't run a transparent Ministry of Foreign Affairs, that enables public and judicial oversight, and maintain high-level relations with a country whose Ministry of Foreign Affairs treats public oversight as an existential threat. You can't run a transparent defense partnership with a foreign partner whose military treats transparency as a threat to its structure and authority. And so on and so forth).\n\nIt's very hard to \"compartmentalize\" corruption. You can't give your okay to *some* lack of public oversight, and some shady procurement deals, but only as long as they relate to Russian defense partnership. As long as you have a working relationship with state-sanctioned institutions that don't operate based on the rule of law, you're going to get stuck with some thug warts.\n\nThere's nothing specifically Russian about this, it applies to any other countries with rampant, state-sanctioned corruption, regardless of the sanctioning mechanism (whether it's how the country's one party does business, as in China, or that the state is unable to effectively fight corruption so it tries to work out a functional agreement, as in like half of Africa at one point).

A fairly solid percentage of the interviewees seem to willingly parrot government propaganda. I was somewhat surprised by how even seemingly liberal-minded interviewees seem to uncritically repeat the idea that the US and Europe want to expropriate Russia's resources.\n\n> Do Russians not think it\u2019s weird that their closest ally is North Korea?\n\n- [Interviews about what Russians think about their relationship with North Korea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpKEjegrR_w)\n- [Are we turning into North Korea?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42Rwi3Fn9fA)\n\nBasic summary: there's an insane amount of cognitive dissonance going on here. Many of the same people who recognize what a mess the DPRK is are unable to recognize that the exact same criticisms they apply to Kim can be applied to Putin. \n\nIf you watch enough of these interviews, eventually it becomes clear that the overwhelming majority of interviewees fit into one of two groups. The largest group mindlessly repeats whatever propaganda they have been force fed via TV and will jump through ridiculous mental hoops to try to explain away any inconsistent evidence which Daniil may confront them with. They are in general older, although occasionally younger interviewees are just as insane as the babushkas who seemingly universally want to bring back the Soviet Union. Putin is apparently very popular with older women. They're his most reliable supporters out of any demographic segment in Russia. The second, smaller group consists of individuals who do demonstrate critical thinking skills, but who are often forced to self-censor during interviews to avoid risking legal consequences for criticizing the war, military, or Putin, which can at times manifest as incredibly tortured circumlocutions that are not outright negative while still attempting to acknowledge the difficulties Russia faces now.",

There are obviously divergences from how Russia fights, but ultimately it relies on massed fires from artillery in a way that Western militaries don't. They have no modern airforce, had no significant number of PGMs, and were reliant on 40+ year old stocks of equipment.\n\nEurope's armament stocks are definitely not enough to fight a protracted war, with a grinding stalemate where there is an artillery duel for every single treeline - but that's not the war we would have gotten. An invasion of, say, Poland, by the 2022 Russian Army wouldn't still be going on 17 months later, it wouldn't have devolved into slow, bloody offensives where every half a yard is fought over. Yes Europe would quickly deplete ammunition stocks, but look at the equipment that those states would be fielding - 250+ M270/MARS and HIMARS launchers, hundreds of F-16s, Rafales, Eurofighter Typhoons, plus some Gripens and F-35s for good measure, and, chiefly, a whole host of the sort of stand-off PGMs that Ukraine lacks (Storm Shadow/SCALP-EG, Taurus, Tomahawks, MdCN) - it would be a completely different type of war. With air superiority and the capability to consistently strike Russian rear-echelon positions, there is no need to engage in the sort of artillery duels that we're seeing in Ukraine which require a staggering amount of shells to keep-up.\n\nEuropean states were (and are) negligent in that they certainly didn't possess the stocks of equipment or ammunition to conventionally defeat what we thought the Russian military was prior to Ukraine. I think it is clear that, in reality, there was enough to defeat 2022 Russia, who ground to a halt in Ukraine, fighting a country with significantly less to hand than a combined European effort. That doesn't mean that Europe shouldn't invest in its defence once more, because a revanchist and combat experienced Russian military that engages in some self-reflection and rebuilds itself, could be a very different proposition in a decade's time.",

Same in Kherson and Kharkiv - significant amounts of abandoned equipment, but ultimately Russia was able to withdraw its forces mostly intact. They were able to continue the fight because at no point has their fighting strength been absolutely destroyed, it has just been consistently chipped away at by Ukraine.\n\nNo chance that happens in a similar scenario in Poland - those convoys are going to be absolutely annhilated by European airpower and MLRS. Then - and this is by far the biggest difference - the follow-up punch will be hundreds of times more effective than what Ukraine could deliver. You'll see actual combined arms maneuver warfare, carried out by troops trained for it and general staff versed in it, with retreating Russians encircled and then captured/killed en masse, in a way that Ukraine couldn't. You'd also see strikes deep inside Russia, which Ukraine doesn't have the capacity to do consistently.

Especially since the hypothetical - the US not getting involved at all, and Europe not changing its defence spending at all in response - is already beyond unlikely.\n\nIn short, a Russian invasion of Poland in 2022 would look nothing like their invasion of Ukraine, and, correspondingly, the material requirements of combatants would be completely different. There are plenty of lessons for Western militaries to learn from Ukraine - but the lesson isn't necessarily that they need Soviet-esque stockpiles of artillery ammunition. That wasn't the way the West planned to counter the USSR in the 1980s, and it wouldn't be the plan now either - especially not when we've seen how effective the limited numbers of modern Western systems given to Ukraine have been. Europe needs to improve its defence capabilities, but that is in response to a potentially revanchist and rebuilt Russian military decades down the line - not because we'd have seen a 7-days to the Rhine scenario had Russia invaded Poland last year instead of Ukraine.",

That&#39;s the fundamental problem with your analogy.  </p>\n\n<p>Also, another problem - you claim nuclear weapons were placed in former soviet states.  They aren&#39;t.  Even if we&#39;re generous and assume you included other sovereign nations the USSR conquered as part of the warsaw pact, they still aren&#39;t.  US nukes are (as far as I recall) located in Germany, Italy, and a few other western European nations.  I can see why you included that point, pushing nukes up to Russia would be a very understandable reason for Russia to be upset.  It&#39;s why we haven&#39;t.</p>\n</div>",

Zelensky didn't fire every regional military recruitment commander in the country in mid August or recently direct that he was pursuing extradition of draft dodgers who jumped ship to the EU if things were good to go, those measures are pretty indicative of a nation wide recruiting problem. Which is in line with many previous credible reports that most who wanted or were willing to serve are already in uniform. Though I'll be honest, if Zelensky opens up conscription of women that ends the manpower crisis for the time being. \n\nIt works in their favor that the UAF offensive forces seem to now focus on small unit dismounted probing attacks with a fires heavy operational scheme. That at least will cut down on casualties, but they won't advance much unless they push in a concerted effort. And waiting until the Russians run out of troops or artillery systems is a dangerous gamble, to say the least. \n\nPart of me says to keep going, maybe the Russians might actually crack, despite the absurdity of beating the Russians at attrition. The other part of me says the Ukrainians should stop now before they break their army's future offensive potential and use up the bulk of their ammo stockpile doubling down on what was already a rather flawed plan to begin with, instead of stopping,, regrouping, and creating/executing a different and better strategic plan. \n\nThough I guess it's a bit late in the season to try something new, they have about a month until the wet season starts. If they stop now they can't try again until the frost starts, and attacking in the winter is very problematic for many reasons.",
