Please minimize editorializing, please make your opinions clearly distinct from the content of the article or source, please do *not* cherry pick facts to support a preferred narrative,\n\n\\* Read the articles before you comment, and comment on the content of the articles,\n\n\\* Post only credible information\n\n\\* Contribute to the forum by finding and submitting your own credible articles,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* Use memes, emojis or swears excessively, \n\n\\* Use foul imagery,\n\n\\* Use acronyms like LOL, LMAO, WTF, /s, etc. excessively,\n\n\\* Start fights with other commenters,\n\n\\* Make it personal, \n\n\\* Try to out someone,\n\n\\* Try to push narratives, or fight for a cause in the comment section, or try to 'win the war,'\n\n\\* Engage in baseless speculation, fear mongering, or anxiety posting. Question asking is welcome and encouraged, but questions should focus on tangible issues and not groundless hypothetical scenarios. Before asking a question ask yourself 'How likely is this thing to occur.'

Unless you&#39;re speaking purely in terms of territorial claims, I don&#39;t see how any of them will, practically speaking, be any impediment to Chinese naval movements, especially not in the next 5 years.</p>\n\n<p>As such, practically speaking I think this &quot;hemming in&quot; is currently purely theoretical and I don&#39;t think possession of Taiwan would make much practical difference in terms of actual naval freedom of movement, at least without an immediate and massive up-gunning of those islands, which I see no sign of happening.</p>\n</div>",

He recalled his visit to Kiev in July, during which he announced a comprehensive initiative to support Ukraine's recovery efforts amid the war with Russia.\n\u00a0\nThe Korean government will provide short-term aid to Ukraine in 2024 in the form of grants, humanitarian aid and support through international financial institutions included the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), according to the presidential office.\n\nThe $2 billion support package for rebuilding Ukraine will be provided in the form of long-term, low-interest concessional loans through the Economic Development Cooperation Fund (EDCF) beginning in 2025.\n\u00a0\nThe EDCF was established in 1987 to provide loans to developing countries.\n\u00a0\n\"Since World War II, the international community has established the prohibition of the use of force as a solid legal principle,\" Yoon said in his address, calling for an \"end to the war and a restoration of peace in Ukraine as soon as possible\" in keeping with such principles.\n\u00a0\nDuring the \"One Future\" session, Yoon emphasized the need to expand the role of multilateral development banks to better tackle global challenges including the climate crisis, food security and sustainable development.\n\u00a0\nHe also said Korea will help lead the establishment of a digital norm order and actively lead discussions on restructuring debt for low-income countries.\n\u00a0\nThe theme of this year's G20 summit chaired by India was \"One Earth, One Family, One Future,\" as world leaders focused on issues including sustainable development, climate financing, trade and investments, a digital transition and safeguarding international peace.\n\u00a0\nYoon's presidential office said that the amount promised to Ukraine is unprecedent, twice the amount compared to the usual assistance ranging from $500 million to $1 billion.\n\u00a0\n\"This is to demonstrate our responsible role as a global pivotal state in taking the lead in the restoration of peace in Ukraine and laying the foundation for full-fledged participation in its future reconstruction,\" a senior presidential office said in a press briefing in New Delhi, regarding the plans to support Ukraine's recovery.\n\u00a0\nIn July, Yoon made a surprise visit to Kyiv for a summit with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and announced the \"Ukraine Peace and Solidarity Initiative,\" Korea's comprehensive package of security, humanitarian and reconstruction aid.\n\nIn the first session on \"One Earth\" Saturday, Yoon pledged an additional $300 million to the Incheon-headquartered Green Climate Fund as part of Korea's efforts to help developing countries respond to climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\u00a0\nKorea contributed $100 million in 2013 and another $200 million between 2020 and this year to the climate fund.\n\u00a0\nThe G20 leaders on Sunday issued a joint declaration which contained softer language on Russia than anticipated. The leaders pledged to unite in endeavors \"to address the adverse impact of the war on the global economy and welcome all relevant and constructive initiatives that support a comprehensive, just, and durable peace in Ukraine.\"\u00a0\n\nOn the sidelines of the G20 summit in India, Yoon had several encounters with U.S. President Joe Biden after their last meeting at the trilateral summit with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in Camp David last month.\n\u00a0\nYoon and Biden had a brief reunion in the leaders' lounge area at the Bharat Mandapam International Exhibition-Convention Centre in New Delhi on Saturday afternoon.\n\u00a0\nYoon recalled that there have been \"various opportunities discussing how the trilateral cooperation between Korea, the United States and Japan will contribute to freedom, peace and prosperity around the world,\" Kim Eun-hye, senior presidential secretary for press affairs, said in a statement.\n\u00a0\nYoon also thanked Biden for his hospitality at Camp David on Aug. 18, calling it a \"personally unforgettable moment\" and called to \"continue to create more history together.\"\n\u00a0\nBiden in turn jokingly invited Yoon to return back home with him since they already had spent time together at the presidential vacation spot.\n\u00a0\nLater Saturday evening, Yoon and first lady Kim Keon Hee attended a gala dinner at the convention center hosted by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. They shared a table with Biden, Modi, Kishida and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.\n\u00a0\nYoon and Biden were seated next to each other at the dinner event, and the two leaders further discussed their trilateral summit with Kishida, according to his office.\n\u00a0\n\"Solidifying the Korea-U.S.-Japan cooperation mechanism established at Camp David will greatly contribute to the development of the Indo-Pacific region and global society,\" Yoon said to Biden. \"Furthermore, it will create quality jobs in our three countries.\"\n\u00a0\nBiden in turn told Yoon that he was the \"driving force\" behind the trilateral cooperation at Camp David, which he said will have a \"positive impact\" on the lives of ordinary families of the three countries, according to Kim.\n\u00a0\nDuring his weeklong overseas trip that took him to Indonesia for Asean-related meetings and India for the G20 summit, Yoon held bilateral talks with the leaders of some 20 countries.\n\u00a0\nOn Saturday, Yoon also took part in a separate summit of Mikta countries, a partnership of five middle-power countries: Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea, Turkey and Australia.\n\u00a0\nThis marked the 10th anniversary of the Mikta grouping, and the five leaders issued a joint press statement expressing \"deep concerns\" on the \"increasingly challenging global strategic environment due to increasing division in the world\" and various challenges including climate change, rising food security, elevated energy prices and the war in Ukraine.\n\u00a0\nThe leaders pledged to \"strengthen our joint actions on global issues where we have shared interests, and reinforce our constructive role internationally.\"\n\u00a0\nYoon held bilateral talks with the leaders of countries including Argentina, Turkey, Bangladesh, Comoros and Nigeria along the sidelines of the G20 summit.",

They shared a table with Biden, Modi, Kishida and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.\n\u00a0\nYoon and Biden were seated next to each other at the dinner event, and the two leaders further discussed their trilateral summit with Kishida, according to his office.\n\u00a0\n&quot;Solidifying the Korea-U.S.-Japan cooperation mechanism established at Camp David will greatly contribute to the development of the Indo-Pacific region and global society,&quot; Yoon said to Biden. &quot;Furthermore, it will create quality jobs in our three countries.&quot;\n\u00a0\nBiden in turn told Yoon that he was the &quot;driving force&quot; behind the trilateral cooperation at Camp David, which he said will have a &quot;positive impact&quot; on the lives of ordinary families of the three countries, according to Kim.\n\u00a0\nDuring his weeklong overseas trip that took him to Indonesia for Asean-related meetings and India for the G20 summit, Yoon held bilateral talks with the leaders of some 20 countries.\n\u00a0\nOn Saturday, Yoon also took part in a separate summit of Mikta countries, a partnership of five middle-power countries: Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea, Turkey and Australia.\n\u00a0\nThis marked the 10th anniversary of the Mikta grouping, and the five leaders issued a joint press statement expressing &quot;deep concerns&quot; on the &quot;increasingly challenging global strategic environment due to increasing division in the world&quot; and various challenges including climate change, rising food security, elevated energy prices and the war in Ukraine.\n\u00a0\nThe leaders pledged to &quot;strengthen our joint actions on global issues where we have shared interests, and reinforce our constructive role internationally.&quot;\n\u00a0\nYoon held bilateral talks with the leaders of countries including Argentina, Turkey, Bangladesh, Comoros and Nigeria along the sidelines of the G20 summit.</p>\n</div>",

I cannot find the source of these planes.</p>\n\n<p>At any rate, transfer approval does not necessarily confirm a purchase, but is close to the last step in the process of acquisition, the last being the signing of a contract. With this being said, due to Argentina&#39;s perpetual curses, no matter how far into the process something is, until you see cash changing hands then everything is up in the air and can come crashing down without warning... like countless previous military contracts did.</p>\n\n<p>If the contract does go through, it will mark the revival of the country&#39;s air intercept capability, which it currently lacks.</p>\n</div>",

Instead, they might pressure Warsaw to acquiesce to Russia's demands \"to prevent bloodshed\" or for similar nonsense.\n\nSo Warsaw doesn't feel as secure as it might look from the outside. An invasion or territorial annexation by Russia would be extremely costly for PL, prompting Poland's commitment to ensuring that Kyiv never falls to Putin. I'm fairly confident that the majority of the military hardware Warsaw is rapidly purchasing is intended for potential donation to Ukraine should the need arise. This equipment will likely be stored for the long-term. Poland's intention is to be prepared, so that if the US were ever to abandon Ukraine, Warsaw could independently support Ukraine. It's far more cost-effective to continuously pour military equipment into Ukraine to stem Putin than to face the threat of a Russian annexation or invasion of Poland.\n\nIt's worth noting that almost no Poland's kit is of European origin.

At present, it appears they're on track to allocate approximately 20% of their GDP to new military hardware purchases. The total defense spending is expected to be significantly higher, as hardware purchases typically account for merely 30% of the lifetime costs incurred. This level of spending is staggering! This is an EU/NATO country! I'm baffled as to why this isn't being discussed more widely.\n\nIn my opinion, there were a lot of closed-door meetings between EU countries about how to respond to the invasion of Ukraine. Poland's leadership was likely involved in discussions - and Poland's takeaway from these meetings was rather bleak: should Poland face an attack from Russia, and if the U.S. were to refrain from intervening (for instance, if Trump were reelected and withdrew from NATO), neither Berlin nor Paris would come to Poland's aid. Instead, they would likely pressure Warsaw to make territorial concessions to Russia and give up its resistance (I'm sure Macron would offer to call Putin on Poland's behalf).\n\nThis would echo the events of 1939 for Poland. In 1939 despite a military alliance with the UK and France, these alliances proved useless in preventing an invasion by Germany and then by USSR. Neither the UK nor France offered significant help, leading to an occupation of Poland by the USSR that lasted approximately 50 years. Clearly, Warsaw does not want a repeat of that.\n\n---\n\nRegarding the extensive military hardware that Poland is purchasing, and the question of whether PL's military will be able to effectively integrate & utilize it:\n\nBased on what I've previously mentioned, I believe that Warsaw perceives its best chance of averting a Russian invasion lies in two factors: (1) deterring Moscow (for instance: 500 HIMARS), and (2) preventing the fall of Ukraine. If Ukraine remains resistant to Russian control, the likelihood of Poland being invaded by Putin becomes nearly infinitesimal. Thus, I surmise that Poland envisages its hardware purchases to serve as an armory in support of Ukraine's resistance to Putin. No matter the outcome (even if the US abandons Ukraine), Poland is intent on being in a position where it alone can support Kyiv against Russia. I suspect they will mothball most of the newly acquired equipment, storing it in a warehouse to be dispatched to Ukraine should the need arise.\n\n---\n\nEdit: for context, even Samuel Sharap (RAND, \"famous\" for his pre-invasion take on Ukraine [\"The West\u2019s Weapons Won\u2019t Make Any Difference to Ukraine\"](https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/01/21/weapons-ukraine-russia-invasion-military/)) a few day ago: \n\nhttps://twitter.com/scharap/status/1682847288345911299\n\n> The Putin rant on Poland with set propaganda piece from Naryshkin does not bode well...It's one thing for Soloviev to say things like that, but what's the point of making a big show of this at a televised Security Council meeting unless something is in the works...\n\n---\n\nEdit\u0010 2: I contend that Poland's decision to refrain from purchasing any military hardware from France or Germany is not a coincidence, nor is it due to the EU's defense production failing to meet Warsaw's needs.

It went out of production at Omsk 22 years ago and the factory was renovated at least twice since then.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I doubt suspension and hull layout are why the Russians are choosing the T-80 over the T-90, so those differences are irrelevant. Please feel free to argue otherwise, but it seems absurd in this context to suggest the tank&#39;s layout is driving the decision to prioritize T-80 production over T-90 production.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is no T-80 production now and I doubt there will ever be any T-80 production again.</p>\n</div>",

Russia values the land bridge very highly. I believe they'd sacrifice every unit in Zaporizhzhia if it meant holding the land bridge, bleeding Ukraine, and deteriorating Western morale/willingness to provide materiel. That means it'll be very difficult to force Russia to retreat, even if their positions are compromised, and even if every military science book ever written would tell them to withdraw.\n\n(Proof: Urozhaine, Robotyne.)",

I believe they&#39;d sacrifice every unit in Zaporizhzhia if it meant holding the land bridge, bleeding Ukraine, and deteriorating Western morale/willingness to provide materiel. That means it&#39;ll be very difficult to force Russia to retreat, even if their positions are compromised, and even if every military science book ever written would tell them to withdraw.</p>\n\n<p>(Proof: Urozhaine, Robotyne.)</p>\n</div>",

The FOI (Swedish Defense Research Agency)&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.foi.se/rest-api/report/FOI-R--5479--SE\">report</a> on the prelude of and first year of the war has a more comprehensive summary of the events leading up towards the decision to invade.</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s a reason Russian propagandists often say that the war is existential, because it truly is, but only for the Russian political establishment. It&#39;s also why it is rational for them to continue the war, rejecting diplomacy unless Ukraine&#39;s political leadership is replaced at the minimum (or something else that prevents them from resisting long-term, such as being barred from NATO). What percentage of Zaporizhzhia Oblast is <em>de facto</em> Russian has little relevance.</p>\n</div>",

I am probably more pro-RU than most of this sub, but my goal is really to understand this thing, not win propaganda arguments. So my nuanced position is that while Russia was pushed to attack to some extent, in the end they are the ones that stroke first and that's something that they will have to live with forever. \n\nWith that said... does it even matter who attacked first? To borrow from Blinken, it takes two for a tango, so in a historical account I would imagine all sides would end up equally responsible, not unlike what happened after WW1.\n\n> I bet you also believe that Ukraine is a fascist state and Russia \"had no choice\" but to intervene because Russian-speaking minorities in Eastern Ukraine were being persecuted. You can't deny that Russian military action has killed many Russian-speaking Ukrainians - the people they have claimed to protect.\n\nI don't think Ukraine is fascist state. I do believe, and there is a plenty of evidence available, that Ukraine is a failed state, mired in systemic corruption and mainly ruled by oligarchs under a guise of democracy. It is also a state with a strong neonazi minority which have had disproportionate impact on its policies, including being the spearhead of the Maidan revolution, and systemic oppression of ethnic Russians. As for protecting Russians by Russia, Russia does have the right to do it according to UN founding principles, though like I said above, I do agree and wish they haven't decided to do it in a militarily way.\n\n> To develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace;\n\nArticle 1, section 2 of UN Charter ^^\n\nRussian minorities in the East no longer wanted to live in Ukraine after 2014. Ukraine was oppressing their fundamental rights, and Russia, as one of the permanent security council members, was in the right to intervene, same way as US intervened in Kosovo for example.",

So my nuanced position is that while Russia was pushed to attack to some extent, in the end they are the ones that stroke first and that&#39;s something that they will have to live with forever. </p>\n\n<p>With that said... does it even matter who attacked first? To borrow from Blinken, it takes two for a tango, so in a historical account I would imagine all sides would end up equally responsible, not unlike what happened after WW1.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I bet you also believe that Ukraine is a fascist state and Russia &quot;had no choice&quot; but to intervene because Russian-speaking minorities in Eastern Ukraine were being persecuted. You can&#39;t deny that Russian military action has killed many Russian-speaking Ukrainians - the people they have claimed to protect.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t think Ukraine is fascist state. I do believe, and there is a plenty of evidence available, that Ukraine is a failed state, mired in systemic corruption and mainly ruled by oligarchs under a guise of democracy. It is also a state with a strong neonazi minority which have had disproportionate impact on its policies, including being the spearhead of the Maidan revolution, and systemic oppression of ethnic Russians. As for protecting Russians by Russia, Russia does have the right to do it according to UN founding principles, though like I said above, I do agree and wish they haven&#39;t decided to do it in a militarily way.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>To develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Article 1, section 2 of UN Charter <sup>^</sup></p>\n\n<p>Russian minorities in the East no longer wanted to live in Ukraine after 2014. Ukraine was oppressing their fundamental rights, and Russia, as one of the permanent security council members, was in the right to intervene, same way as US intervened in Kosovo for example.</p>\n</div>",
